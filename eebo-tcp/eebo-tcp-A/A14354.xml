            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The second thinge that the faythfull must take heede of / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Rule which they must obserue ys this: <note place="margin">2</note> That they do lyue an holy lyfe / and that amonge the vnbeleauers their conuersacion be so godly / graue / comely / and agreing with their profession / that in no wise they do gyue any offence through the wickednes of their lyfel: for yf by their lyfe the vnfaythfull shuld be offendid / then shuld their my nistery be vnprofitable to the vnbeleuers / for that by their euell doings they shuld ouerthrowe what soeuer they labored to builde vpp in wordes.</p>
            <p>The thred thinge that theise men must take hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de <note place="margin">3</note> of / and Rule which they must obserue is.

to wynne the vnbeleauer from hys supersticion / and Idolatrie: For this Rule of the holy ghoste <note place="margin">Ro. 3</note> doth euer remain certain / Euell things ar not to be doone / that goode maye comme therof. This vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeable rule must not be broken.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last thing that theise men must <note place="margin">4</note> take heede of / and Rule which they must obseru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e is this. That they haue not ther familiar conuersacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the vnbeleuers for their own cause / as for their pleasure and recreacion / or for their gayn and profite / but only in respect of wynnynge them to the gospell of christe.

For yf the vnbeleauers shall shew themselues so obstinate in their euell / that they gyue iuste cause to despaire of ther amen dement / then ar they vtterly to be forsaken / and no conuersacion or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie is to be hadd with them / farther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the necessitie of lyfe enforcith either par tie. As yff the vnbeleauers shuld be in such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me necessitie / that they could not be releaued but at the hand of the faythfull: or yf theise shuld be in that necessitie / that they could not otherwise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thinges necessarie but of the vnfaithfull. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in byinge and selling thinges necessarie for the lyfe / as garmentes / victuals / and such like: Agayn in such thinges as cyuile estates / and condicions do require / as of princes and Rulars to demaunde

In theise thinges to vse the vnbeleauers / or to minister vnto them / ys not vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>Thus and in thys manier / yt ys lawfull for a pri uate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / which is lerned / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in godds trui the / being in that place wher no man ys compelled to be partaker of wicked supersticions / to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether / and vse familiar conuersacion with the vn beleuers and vnfaythfull / as theise named Rules and condicions / do appoint and suffer. And so haue ye this proposicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> declared and opened / The same ys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed / by the example of Christ our Sa uiour.

            <p>After the same maner / the prophetes in the olde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

ple. So were the Apostles famyliarlie conuersaun te with the vnbeleuinge Iues / and went also emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gest other vnbeleuing nations and men. S.

            <p>And thus / I thinke / that this our proposition / (which of yt owne selfe ys plaine and euident ynou ghe) ys sufficientlie proued. Namelie thys / that a priuate man / learned / and constaunte in the trui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the / beinge in that place where no man ys compel led to communicate with wicked supersticions / maye be familiarlie conuersante with the vnbele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers / so longe as in hys conuersation he doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and kepe / the conditions before mencioned. <note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vuith men exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But herin thin cke not that I do alowe suche ignoraunce and una blenes in men. Suche ignoraunce in men is shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to be reproued / for ther is none so ueri an idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te / so simple and vnlearned amonge Christianes / but he ys bounde in conscience to be able to rendre an accompte of hys faythe / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d also to be somwhat able to teache and instructe others / yea and to saye somwhat for the truthe / in all the principall poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the christian faythe / which he maye do yf he be but meanlie instructed in the Catechisme. But bicause / partlie throughe the peruersnes of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters which do not their office to instructe men / partlie throughe the negligence of men which do not their dutie in seekinge to be instructed / suche ig noraunce there is / I admytt therfore into this my collection those ignoraunte / vnable / and weake men. And so I make this proposition. Those men

which are of a priuate estate and condition / dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge or beinge in a place where they be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to communicate with wicked supersticions. And are themselues vnlearned and vnable to con fesse a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d defende the truithe / maye not vse famyliar conuersation with the vnbeleuers.</p>
            <p>These men ar not in that condition that the lear ned be / of whom I dyd speake before / for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not teache the vnbeleuers / yea they be not able to defende the gospell of christe from the blasphemie of the vnbeleuers / neither can they deliuer them sel ues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suche false snares as the vnbeleauers shall laye for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Wherfor they must not haue familiar conuersacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with them / through which they shall thus throwe themselues into perill / and ieoperdie: Except that they can assure themselues of such stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ghth / that they shall not yealde vnto the wicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnes of the vnbeleuers.

necessitie as can not be auoided / therfor the man that ys weake in faithe must not lern them of hym. Yt is a very daungerus thinge / to vse them which ar vnbeleauers as Masters and teachers: for often tymes in the myndes of the hearers ther arisith a gret admiracion and estimacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the teacher / and it maye easilye com to pas at the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ghthe / that they shall thincke and Iudge that theise teachers ar not deceyued in Religion / bicause they be of an exacte and perfect knowledge in these liberall sciences / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d philosophie. This (I saye) may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it that men ar wont to attribute mutch vnto their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.

            <p>Sum do heere obiect and saye / that S. Paul to the Corinthians doth appoint no such Rule condi cion nor exception / as I haue spoken of / vnto the weake and vnlearned: but he playnly saith. If ony of them which beleaue not / do bidd you to a feaste / <note place="margin">

Our sacrificing prests ar not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this / for they will haue their own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cke to be an vnwonted worcke / belonging to them alone / which neither the scriptures / nor the fathers do teache: ffor to offer this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of which the fathers do speake / partayneth not to the preist alone / but to the whole poeple that sto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dith by / and doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate / And so it is a

common oblacion and sacrifice of all / not of the preiste more then of the poeple / but this only that the preist both in wordes and action / doth go be fore thepoeple.</p>
            <p>Augustine doth saye / that the churche is offered in that offeringe which it doth offer. ffor all which do <note place="margin">de Ciuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te dei. lib. 10. cap. 6.</note> communicate / they do offer them selues vnto godd / and do testifie that their will is / to abide in christe.</p>
            <p>The papistes do holde also that the breade is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the substaunce of christes bodie / and that ther remaynith nothing but the qualitie and accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ce of breade as whitenes / rc. for the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / saye they / is christes bodie.

            </p>
            <p>The vse of the breade and wyne by christis institucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is only / that the congregacion shuld eate and drin cke therof in the remembrance of christe / But the pa pistes in their Masse do most shamefully abuse them both. ffor wheare as the worde of godd saythe: Thow shalt worshipp the Lorde thy godd <note place="margin">Deutron 6 math. 4.</note> and hym only shalt thow serue / They in ther masse do lyfte upp the breade and wyne / and euen in the rowme of godd they sett them furthe to be adored and worshipped of the poeple: now how farr this differrith from the vse of christes supper eich man may se. Yea what can be more vile and filthie Idola trie / then to adore and worshipp a peace of brede a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cupp of wyne / as godd? Be not offended that I do

            <p>The apostle commaundith that thinges shuld not <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14</note> not be doone in the congregacion in a straunge ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue / 
<pb facs="tcp:19118:28"/>
except ther wer an Interpretour / that the thing being vnderstonded of all / the hearers might saye / Amen / and that the edifyinge of them shuld be sought. Now theise men in their masse do all in the Laten tongue / which is to the common poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnknown / and they do defend this theyr doing euen against the worde of godd. But it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn that christe our sauiour in his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration / and after him all his apostles and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which wer hebrues / vsed theyr vulgare he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue tongue / the Grecians also their greke tonge. And euen vnto this daye the Sclauonians in their churches vse their vulgare and commen speache.</p>
            <p>Those wordes of our greate and singuler con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation / in wich the partakinge of Christes bodye and bloude is promised / the papistes in their Masse speake secretlie / they whisper them so that euen they which knowe the Latine tonge ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor vnderstande them.

And so the greke churche a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Chur che of India / do yet speake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> audible voice And the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t manier was / as Ambrose and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustie amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other of the fathers do testifie that the people dyd answer vnto those words.

But as I suppose the papistes do thus murmure a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke these words in secrete / bicause they wolde not ha ue their Lies knowen / for they do saye / Take ye and

The wordes be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the people: And yet they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues do eate and drinke vp all alone / and do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute vnto no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ells. Is not this to make a lie? To lie alwaies is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be an euill thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge / but befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re god to lie / is a moste shamles and wiked thinge: who dothe eate (o ye lyyng papistes) or who doth drinke wyth you? If ye do distribute at any tyme to ony other ye do yt not when ye your selues receyue / but ye chose for them an other time / yea and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde also / for to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye do minister but the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade onlye. Thus ye se that all theise thinges which these massers do in their masse / ar contrarye to the institution of Christe. Ther masse then and Christes supper ar not lyke</p>
            <p>The papistes saye that by their Action (I meane ther handeling of ther breade and wyne) they do ap plie vnto others the profitt of Christs bloudie sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they saye that they make sacrifices to profit the quicke and the Deade, and this do they i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther masse: But the scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth / that there is but one only propiciatorie sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice / able and auaylable to take awaie synnes / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Christe Iesus offered in his owne fleshe vpon the Crosse. And that euerie man muste applie vnto him selfe by liuelie faythe the benefite of that same sacrifice of christe / as the scripture teacheth likewi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se / that eche man is iustified by his owne faithe, and
<pb facs="tcp:19118:29"/>
that eche man in his owne righteousnes or vnrigh teousnes / doth liue / or die. It teachithe also that christe did institute the sacrament only to this end that the congregacion shuld eate and drincke it in the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>beraunce of that same his Sacrifice. And that eicheone in the drincking therof shuld apply vn to himself by faithe / the fruite of that Sacrifice. Now compare the doctrine of the scriptures and of the papistes in this pointe together / and thou shalt se that their Masse is contrarie to christes In stitucion. But as they haue / so still will they saye:</p>
            <p>That aswell the liuing as the deade be helped by this their acte applied at their pleasure. If they wolde saie that thei profyt others by praier / that were tollerable. But they go further and saie / that ther verye massinge worcke it selfe / hathe so moche vertue / power a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d strenghthe in it / that it shall profit not only all kyndes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / but all such creatures a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d beastes for whom they do say ther masse / bicause in it they do applye the benefite of christes passion: but ye must vndersto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be payed for ther labor. This is an horrible error in no wise to be suffered / for as I sayed / ther is but one only sacrifice propicia torie to take awaye synne / which one sacrifice eiche one of us must applie vnto our selues by liuelie fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the / And this applyinge faithe is the only gifte of god: But on this grounde buylde they their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie and mutch other such pélf / by which they do pyckemens purses. They saye ther Masses also
<pb facs="tcp:19118:29"/>
in the honor of this / or of that saincte. And of what saintes? suche verylie whose histories are not certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynlie knowen / and are of none authoritie / yea many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are no better then poetes fables / of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not vnworthelie we doubte whether they be sainctes or no: But be it that they were true sainctes / yet this their doinge is moste co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to christes ordinance / for Christe did institute his supper to this ende that it sholde be used in the remembrance of his deathe and not of other mens / weare they neuer so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.</p>
            <p>In their masse they haue also diuers and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie rytes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d customs / clothes / signes / gestures / tor nes / remouinges / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d blissinges / of and with the bre ade a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wine / but christe vsed none of all theis in his supper: And what they do meane by these thinges the poeple doth not knowe / neither can the priestes them selues for the most part tell what is ment by them: for if ye aske the meaninge of them / either ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they saye nothinge at all / or if they do saie owghte / they do not saye all one thinge / but thinges that be moste co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie / wherby a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maie iudge that there is no truithe at all in their wordes.

This sentence he hath also confirmed by exam ples: For when he was required to circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cise Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <note place="margin">Actor. 16.</note> because that the custumme which was yet in force might be kept / he did it: But when they wolde enforce him to the ouerthrowig of the christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie / that he shulde likewise circumcise Titus / In no <note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> wyse wolde he gyue place vnto them / no not for the space of one houre / and that because (saith he) false brethren came in / to espie out / or to betray our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. S. Paule did obserue these thinges then / when it might be done without an euell mynd / when no hurte shuld ensue of it: The cause a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d end why Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le did it / was to auoide the offendinge of the belea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Iues / les yf he did it not / they shuld therby be alienated and turned awaye from Christes gospell / which they had newly receyued. But we must not compare these ceremonies of the old lawe with the Inuencions of men / they can not be iustly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Massing: They were plainly taught in Goddes worde / but these masses and popishe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries are thrust vnto vs by the subtiltie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell / and craftye deceyuing of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

S. Iames therfor in this cause doth saye. He that <note place="margin">Iacob. 2.</note> hathe obserued the whole lawe / and dothe offend in one / is made giltye of all. Which sayinge truly is harde and sharpe / but most true / and teachith all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they shuld not extenuate synne. But this place
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19118:39"/>
of Iames / is not so to be vndersto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded / as thoughe <note place="margin">August. Epist. 29. ad Hiero.</note> that all synnes wer equall and like. That doth Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine truly and playnly denye: He saith that the Stoickes do go about to proue it / when they saye / that all vertues are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyned and knitt together / so that he which hathe one of theim hath all / and he that wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tith one wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tith all. For wisdome (saye they) is not fearefull / nott intemperate / not vniuste / ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for it hath ioyned with it the vertues which be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vnto these vices: And likewise iustice / stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the / te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peraunce and other vertues are not vnwise / but are ioyned with wisdome / wheruppon they do conclude / that all vertues are conioyned and knitt together. Theise thinges / saith Augustine / do not <note place="margin">Iaco. 3. 1. Ioan. 1.</note> agre with the holy scriptures / which do witnes. That in many thinges we do all offend / and If we saye that we haue no synne / we do deceyue our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and ther is no truithe in vs. Wherfor seing that we synne in many thinges / and in synnynge we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not haue that vertue which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to that synne which we do committ / and yet it maye be that he which fallith in one synne / may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>staunt in other vertues / the opinion of theis philosophers is fals. As for example: Be it / that one be of an hastye na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture / or do exceade measure in eatinge / and yet he gyuith euery man his own / and will gyue his life in Godds cause: thoughe this man be fearce / and intemperate / yet is he called a iust ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / and a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge man. S. Augustine doth also putt awaye the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the stoicks / whiche is. That the man
<pb facs="tcp:19118:40"/>
doth die in the waters / if they be but half a handfull ouer / his heade / aswell as he ouer whos heade they are / ten / or twentie cubites. This is no apte simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude / saith he / therfor let vs take an other more fitte for our purpose / of light namely and darcknes. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynly when one is in darcknes / the more he dothe departe and go out of it and drawith nighe vnto light / he begynnith the better to see sumwhat / and so though that yet he be compassed with darcknes / yet is he sumwhat partaker of the lighte. But he that wyll knowe more of this matier / let hym reade that Epistle of Augustyne: Wher he prouith playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / that all synnes ar not like / as the Stoicks did thincke: Now to return to our place / which we did rehearce. Be that offendith in one / is giltie of all. Ther is no obseruacion of Godds Lawe to be rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with an exception / as thoughe we might chose one parte of it to obserue / and separate or sett asyde the other parte at our will and pleasure to neglecte it. The commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the lawe ar conioyned of the lorde and knitt together / and so gyuen vnto vs: We must not now disseuer / and separate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we lust / but without exception we must obserue the whole lawe. We must consider and loke vppon the Auctoritie of the lawe gyuer / which is Godd / It is of force aswel in one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement / as in the rest. This doth Iames seame to meane / when he saith: <note place="margin">Iacob. 2.</note> He that hath sayde / Thow shalt not committ adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie / the same hath sayde / Thow shalt not kill. As if he shuld saye / he is no les contraried in any one
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19118:40"/>
of theise commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / then in an other. And therfor (to adde this by the waye) let them wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what they do which do profes to receyue the gospell / and yet they do refuse ecclesiasticall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyne: Wheras the lorde / which hath reuealede and opened the gospell vnto vs by Christe / doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point discipline to be a parte therof. Theise men do synne against the whole lawe. The papistes do also synne herin / which do preache their parted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes / as meritorius of congruitie. But to retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne / this is also manifest / that he that synnith in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne / is therfore giltie in all / for that as now by lust and tentacion he is caried into sum one transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion / and so dothe synne / euen in like manier shuld he offend in an other euill / if he wer assaulted in the same sorte / and whith that same violence of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. And Augustine in the place before alledged. doth saye. That therfore he is made giltie of all / bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he synneth against charitie / vppon which the obseruacion of the whole lawe is grownded. To be short therfor / when we do thus fall into synne / we must not ligtly tryfle it of and excuse it / sayinge that it is but light / and small: for synne is not to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of the matier / and manier of the action only / but of the force poure / and dignitie of Godds wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de which doth forbidd it. And yet les I shuld seeme to be to rigorus and strayte in this matier of mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sehauntinge / let ther be hadd a consideracion / or difference of the matier / and doinge.
<pb facs="tcp:19118:41"/>
And truly I can not see / how this finde of synne and doinge ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be iudged to be light / or small / seing that it is a transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> committed against the furst table of the lawe / in which the worship due vntto Godd is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded which worshipp being sownde and safe in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other vices and synnes ar the more easily corrected: And agayn this being corrupted / all other actes are most vnacceptable vnto Godd. Whordo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Godds lawe is to be punyshed by dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the / yet is it a synne but against the. ij. table. And what shal we thincke then of spirituall whordome? how seuerely doth Godd iudge it? how sharply ought it to be punished? If therfor thow dost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the commandement which thou breakest / it is of God: If the matier / it is aganist the furst table and therfore thys synne is the more heynus and weightie. Besids this / our men do counte this Masse hauntinge a fault to be either contemned / or not so depely to be considered in theim bicause they do not synne with mynde will and affection / but as it wer compelled and of necessite. But I aske them / what manier a violence and compulsion this is throughe which that necessite commithe of which they make their excuse? Truly they can not saye that it is ony other / then bicause they wolde not ronne into the daunger of the losse of their Goodes / their estimacion and lyfe. This is then no absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site <note place="margin">Aristote.

As Aristotle in his Ethicks doth saye of the

losse which shippmen do suffer in a tempest / which do cast out of their ship al their Goodes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be in daunger of shipp wracke: They seame truly to be compelled to do it / and yet willingly they do it / and therfor they are sayed.

And so do they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitt doble synne. Furst they synne willingly. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they do prefer earthly thinges before heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly / outward thinges before inward / the bodie before the soule / their Goodes before God: Which is not done but of such / as ar the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verily / though they do saye nay / they do that which they do / but of that inordinate affection which they do beare to their riches. Wherfor this is no iust excuse which they make. For as well might the Corinthians / euen by the very same reason / haue sayde to Paule. If we do comme vnto these feastes wher the meates offered vnto Idols are eaten / we do it not with that mynde as thoughe we allowed such sacrifices / but we ar compelled therunto / for if we shuld auoide theise solemne feastes / we shuld be taken as sedicius men / euell citizens / vncourteous / we shuld loose our frends / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d most profitable healp

That thinge also is not to be passed ouer of which Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styne maketh mencion / that he hymselfe was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme of this opinion / that nothing sholde be viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye

done agaynst heretiques / but that they shold on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be taughte / But his mynde altered after that he was admonished by some wyse Bishoppes / howe certeyn cities / which somtyme were altogether cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with the errour of the Donatistes / were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The prince therfore / after that he hath gyuen them sufficient instruction / yf he shall enforce these men vnto the embracing of such rites and ceremonies as are good and godlye indede / he shall do no hurte at all / but muche good. I do meane that this sholde be practysed only vpon suche as be cityzens / and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall borne subiectes / or suche as beinge straungers borne / do as denizens dwell in theyr dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d so by priuiledge haue the benefite of theyr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trithe: Otherwyse yf they be but strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>giers which do passe thorough their countrithe / or such as do come either to bye or to sell marchaundize / there is no suche vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be shewed towardes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet this thing they must take heade of euen in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / that they do not seduce their people a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d subiectes which are of a good iudgement / that they do not infect them with vice and errour.

to be as a Iue / or proselyte / neyther did they gyue vnto any the libertie of their countrith / except he did fyrst circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cise himself / admitt Moses lawe / did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate / and became partaker with them in theyr Sacrifices / submitting himself to their discipline: Which thinge / seing it was well and diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued of them / why shuld not our princes do euen the same? That they shuld suffer no Citezen / nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect / eyther naturall / or strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger born / but that they shuld compell and enforce hym / to receyue such reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion / and obserue such rites and ceremonies / agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Godds worde / as they by common auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie haue establyshed. Now will I speake of those princes and Rulers / which ar vnder these chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Whome I do deuide into two sortes. Eyther they are such as haue Iurisdiction / poure / and auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie / which commeth to them by discent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr Auncetours / or els committed vnto them of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours / Kinges / and common welthes: Eyther els they haue no Iurisdiction nor Rule ouer others / neyther by discent from theyr auncetours / nor by commission from other higher princes / but only are taken and estemed as men of worshipp / for the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientnes of theyr house and blud / or for their riches. This laste sorte do not differ at all in a maner from priuate men / of whome I haue spoken before / for these are mere subiectes as they are.

Wherfor seyng these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces / in this case by theyr endeuoir and laboure / do promote that which is goode / they do well and not euell: and so ought they for this doinge to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of the hygher poure / because that herin they do not resiste agaynst them / with that Resistaunce which is forbidden. Wilt thou (saith he) be without
<pb facs="tcp:19118:50"/>
feare of the poure? do well then / and so shalt thou be praysed of the same: If these princes and rulars do defende godlynes and religion / they do good / then by the iudgement of Goddes worde they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of the poure / and do deserue prayse of theyr hygher poures a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d lords. But yf thou do euell (saith Paule) then feare the poure / for he beareth not the sworde for nought / but is the minister of Godd to take vengeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on them which do euell. Thus doth this place arme the myndes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences of these inferior princes of whom I speake / that they shulde not feare theyr hygher poures / when for the defence of Goddes religion / they do resiste and not obeye theyr wicked commaundementes. Yf any will now thus saye agaynst me. He that hath the kinglye and supreame auctoritie / vnto whom by othe I do owe obedience / commaundeth these thinges / and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I must obey. I answer that thou arte not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d herin to keape any such othe or promis.

Agayne yf thou wilt aske / By what righte may these vnder rulars and inferiour magistrates / thus sett them selues agaynst the hygher princes / which haue the verye supreame right and poure to defende pure and godlye Religion / and the true faithe. I aunswere. That the electours of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire / and the Princes of Germanie / and the fre city<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es / do it by the Imperiall poure and righte / whiche

For Emperours and Kinges / and such hygher poures / haue therfor cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and taken these vnder Rulars and officers / as it were into a parte of theyr Rule / to be theyr helpers / in administringe and ordering theyr businesses and charge / to the ende that Iustice might florishe so muche the more. And euen so from the begynninge poure and Rule was gyuen vnto these / that they shulde rule the common wealthe / for that part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of / whiche was committed vnto them / iustlye / vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightlye / and godlye. Whereof the Emprour in the Code doth saye / that yf he shulde commaunde anye thinge agaynste righte / he wolde not that any suche decree of his shulde auayle in iudgementes. The very same thinge is to be sayde / where a kinge or suche which do retayne the supreame auctoritie / do commaunde or determyne anye thinge againste right. Not vnworthily is Traianus the Emperour therfore commended / who when he delyuered the sworde to a Rular in his Empire / sayde: If I do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde Iuste thinges / vse this for me / but yf I do require vniust things / vse it against me. But on the contrary part / Gregorie the great / Byshopp of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me / can not in this behalfe be praysed / but dispray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed / and accused: Who seinge that the lawe whiche Mauritius the Emperour had made was vniuste / which was / That no man entangled with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

of the common wealth / or which was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the warrs / might be made a priest or a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ck / he wrote to the Emperour / That after that he hadd seene hys lawe / he was wonderfullye afrayed and astonied / And therfor he desireth hym to diminishe somwhat of the rigour of the lawe / or els to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge it altogether: But yet he added / That as touchinge hymself / after that he hath now done his office in admonishing hym / now for the obedience which he doth owe vnto him / he wolde publishe his lawe / as he hadd commaunded. Thys acte surely can not, but be reproued in this Busshopp. Agayn here thou wilt happily saye.

            <p>Furst in the Article of Iustification / the papistes do picke out vnto themselues this doctrine: That a <note place="margin">1 The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes are heretiques</note> man is not iustified by faithe only / but by goode

We holde that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is Iustified by faithe / without the deedes of the <note place="margin">Rom. 3. Gal. 2.</note> Lawe. Agayn he saith. We do knowe that a man is not Iustified by the deedes of the lawe / but by the faithe of Iesu Christe. And Peter / whom Paule did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withsto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d / did not speake agaynst this doctrine. Of the Iues / also he writith thus.

In which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce he settith theise two righteousnesses / the one / against the other / the righteousnes of faith / against the righteousnes of worckes / so that the one exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith the other.

            <p>Ther were in the tyme of the Apostles certayn witty disputars which reasoned that it was lawful for Christians to eate meates offered vnto Idols.

Therfor thos faithfull men did contend / that it was lauful indifferently to communicate with the holy seruice of the Christians / and also to sytte down in the Idols feaste.

not represented by the Idoll / that ther is but one Godd / the same our true and euerlastinge Godd: Wherof it folowed that the Idoll was nothinge / that is to say a thinge of no valure or a very vanitie / that it could hurt no bodie / and that the very meate offered vnto the Idoll was a thinge of nothinge / that it did defile no man. But Paule with many wordes doth confute that folery. 1. Cor. cap. 8. 9. and 10. In this tenth chapter amonge other thinges he gatherith of the nature of the supper of the lord that a man maye not bothe be partaker of the supper of the lorde and of the table of Idols / and saith: Ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not drincke of the cup of the lorde / and of the cup of deuils. Ye can not be partakers of the lordes table / and of the table of deuiles. Either do we prouoke the lorde? Are we stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then he?

Yea and the lord Iesus hymself in the boke of the Reuelacion doth greuusly accuse and condemne them which do eate meate offered vnto Idols. This may ye se in the epistles of the churche of Pergamos and Thiatira.

What a dignitie (o bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern) is it / how great a safetie / for a man to depart myrily from hens / to depart so through oppressions and trobles? It is a glorius thinge to shutt vpp the eyes in a moment / with which men and the world wer seene / and forthewith to open the same to se Godd and Christe. But that we maye behold theis thinges in mynde and thought / that we may (I saye) night and daye meditate theis thinges / and sincerly confes the holy name of Christ / and escape and treade down al thinges which are contrary to pure confession / we must diligentlly praye vnto that same our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through Iesus Christe our lorde.</p>
