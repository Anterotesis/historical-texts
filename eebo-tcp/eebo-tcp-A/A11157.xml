            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thys beest so cruel / so conntrefayted. so dyuers &amp; so dredeful / signefyeth the deuyl of helle. which is ful of sorow &amp; of al bytternesse· The body of this beest was as sayth saynt Iohan semblaunte vnto a lyepard.

The feet of the beest were of a bere. For in lyke wyse as the beer hath the myght &amp; strengthe in his feet &amp; in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. &amp; holdeth strongly. &amp; byclyppeth fast that whiche he hath vnder his feet &amp; enbraceth.

That is to vnderstonde of the seuen dedely synnes. and therfore sayth Saynt Iohan that the sayd beest had power ayenst the saynces. for in the erthe is none so holy a man that parfytelye may eschewe al the maners of synnes· that of these vij heedes. &amp; of the vij dedely synnes descende. withoute specyal pryuylege &amp; grace of god / lyke as it was in the virgyn marie / whyche neuer dyd synne / or in another saynt after the specyal grace that he had of god / lyke as the gloryous vyrgyn marye had specyal &amp; synguler grace of god aboue al other creatures.

Eueryche of these seuen dedely synnes is departed in many partyes. &amp; first we shal speke of the synne of pryde. This was the first synne &amp; the begynnyng of al euyl whan the angel lucyfer for his grete beaute and his grete vnderstondyng he wold haue ben aboue alle other angels &amp; wold compare to god that so good &amp; fayr had made hym. &amp; by cause he took suche pryde in hym he fyl fro heuen in to helle and became a deuyll.

Alle proude men resemble thys lucyfer / whiche wyl be aboue the other / and be more preysed. more allowed &amp; more enhaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced than the other· whiche been better &amp; of more valewe than they be / This synne of pryde is ouer perylous. for it blyndeth man &amp; woman / so that they knowe not ne see not the perylle wherin they be by synne / This is the right stronge wyn of the deuyl. and the moost especyal of which he enyureth or maketh dronke the grete lordes &amp; ladyes· the bourgeyses. the ryche / the noble and valyaunte persones. and generally al maner of pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ople.

Thys is the moost perylous ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ladye &amp; sekenesse of al the other / Certeynly he is in grete peryl to whome alle tryacle torneth to venym. lyke as doctryne and chastysyng doth to the proude. For the more men chastyse and blame them of theyr defaultes. so moche more ben they angry &amp; defende them.

This synne is the fyrst. For it assaulteth the knyghtes of our lord. &amp; that laste leueth them. For whan the knyghtes of god haue ouercomen &amp; vaynquysshed alle other vyces and synnes / Thenne assaulte them most strongly the synne of pride and of vayne glorye.</p>

Thys synne is the fortresse of the deuyl. For he kepeth and nouryssheth al the grete synnes. This synne sheweth hym in many maners by werke and by worde. But namely he sheweth hym in vj ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners. That is to wyte in syngularyte / For the proude surqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drous that weneth to be more of valewe and of power. and to knowe more than the other. daygneth not to doo as thother doo whiche ben of more valewe than he is.

And how moche more the seruyse is vyle and despysable so moche gladly doth it the humble and meke. Therfore our lord Ihesu Cryste taught hys appostles to wesshe the feet by humylyte.

For one of the moost honest doughters that humylyte hath is holy symplesse. The humble is ryght true to god. lyke as is a ryght good wyf to hyr husbond. whyche wyl to no man obeye folyly. but to hir husbond onely And therfore none obeyeth so Iustly ne in so good ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cyon as doth the veray humble. whiche hateth not. but for to playse the world. and desyreth noo thynge but to plese god.

This yeft of scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is maystre of the werkys. and that is to saye of vertues of the soule.

That is to enquyre. to Iuge. to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre. &amp; to shewe that whyche they vnderstonde by word. This yefte enseygneth the reason that. whyche he ought to lerne and to enquyre. and in what ordre. and in what maner and what ende. and this is a moche grete crafte / For the mes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prysyng in these thynges is moche peryllous. hit byhoueth to vnderstonde the reason / and to lerne that whiche is necessarye prouffytable and honeste. and to wythdrawe fro the contrarye O god how a creature leseth his tyme / and dyspences for to lerne thynges that ben of no value / but vaynglorye &amp; synne.

And that ledeth hym moost ryght vnto the loue of God for the helthe and the prouffyte of hys soule. and to helpe hys neyghbour.</p>
               <p>¶ Also it byhoueth the reason wel to enquyre the trouthe of the thynges / And also how he ought for to byleue / wel to byleue is. whan a man byleueth symply and stedfastly alle that whyche god sayth and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth wythout ouermoche to enquyre. and wythoute to enserche the counceylles of god / and the profoundnes of his Iugements. the heyght of his ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geste. and the reasons of hys sacramentes / wel to byleue is whan one byleueth not ouer hastely. ne ouer late. ne to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryche / ne to none. for that one &amp; other is vyce as saith seneke / 
<pb facs="tcp:9643:96"/>
After good enquyryng cometh wel to Iuge. For to Iuge wel it apperteyneth that one afferme no thyng. vnto the tyme that he hath enquyred the trouthe of the thynge / and that he be wel encerteyned / and that he entremete not to Iuge that. whyche apperteyneth no thynge to hym· lyke as ben the secrete thynges &amp; hydde / thentencyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of hertes· the thynges that may not be torned on the right syde ne on the lyfte syde. that yet they be vnderstonden to the better parte. Of whyche the spyryte by this yefte maketh the reason to Iuge wel. and to knowe the ryght / &amp; to determyne bytwene good thynges &amp; euyl thynges bytwene the lytel thynges and the grete thynges. for he must prayse euery thynge after his valure. Also this spyryte ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the reason to remembre. For he remembreth a man all that is nedeful to hym. lyke as god sayth in the gospel. The thynges that ben passyd he must reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre and brynge ageyn to memorye. The thynges that been present he must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonde and remembre and ordeyne· The thynges that been to come he must purneye fore / ordeyne and aduyse. These ben the seuen partyes of the vertu of prudence. after that whyche the phylosophre sayth. Also he maketh the reason to speke by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure / and be stylle gladly. and not to speke tyl it be nede. Soo that the word be tofore wel aduysed and wel thought or it come to the tongue· And that the word be wayed and poysed as good money and preued lyke as Salamon sayth· ¶Soo that the worde be accordyng vnto god and wythoute synne of good matere and of good fourme. That is that it haue not ouermoche. ne ouer lytel. And that it be wel em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. For good money ne a good word ought not to be gyuen for nought. ¶ Herof sayth God in the gospel that we shold not caste the precyous stones tofore hogges. That is to vnderstonde the precyous wordes of our lord god byfore them / and to suche persones that sette them self not to werke for theyr helthe. But lyuen in the ordure of theyr synnes.
<pb facs="tcp:9643:96"/>
therfore holy scrypture calleth them hogges. Thys yefte afore sayd ordeyneth and accordeth that other partye of the hert. That is the wylle where it hath iiij partyes. loue. drede / ioye &amp; sorowe. That is that one loue that· whyche he oweth. soo as he oweth. as moche as he oweth. &amp; that he drede not also that whych he oweth / and that he haue no ioye ne delyte sauf in that he oweth after god &amp; also how he oweth / &amp; as moche as he oweth. And that he haue no sorowe ne heuynesse / but in that whiche he oweth / and also how he oweth. &amp; as moche as he oweth. whan these four partyes been accorded. thenne it is sayd that a man is wel attempred whan he is not ouer colde ne ouer hote. ne ouer drye. ne ouer moyste.

The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne is a man ordeyned wythin hym self / These ben the ij sprynges of the rote of a moche fayr vertu which is called equyte.

<pb facs="tcp:9643:107"/>
and the moost wyse that he may fynde. Thus sayth Saynt Austyn. who so wysely wyl confesse hym &amp; fynde grace anenst god. he ought to seche suche a confessour. whyche can and may bynde and vnbynde. and also counceylle. That is that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour can wel knowe synne. and counceylle the synnar. and that he haue power to assoylle hym / &amp; to gyue hym penaunce after the synne. For accordyng to his synne he ought to haue penaunce. Also who so wyl confesse hym wysely he ought dylygently remembre his synnes tofore or he confesse hym &amp; enserche al his hert and his conscyence. how he hath dysplesed god and his blessyd moder and al his sayntes. and ought to remembre alle his lyf in grete drede. Lyke as dyd the good kyng Ezechyas whyche sayd thus. I shal remembre al my yeres in the grete bytternes of my soule and my herte. The synnar ought to entre in to the hous of hys hert / and not to passe thorough lyke a mynystrel whyche abydeth not gladly in his hous. For he hath noo werse home than his owne. But in his owne hert a man ought to dwelle and consyder all his synnes and his deffaultes. wherof he ought to yelde acompts and reason truly to god and to his confessour. and ought to remembre to ordeyne wel his acompte / lyke as he that is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned tofore hys lord for to rendre acompte of al his recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and payementes.

For in taryeng is moche peryl for many reasons. Fyrst for the condycyon of synne. For synne is a fyre brennyng. whyche may not be quenched but by lacry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mable confessyon / And moche were he a fool that sawe hys hows brenne. and wold not hastely renne to fetche water for to quenche the fyre.</p>
               <p>¶ Also it is a grete maladye &amp; sekenesse to dwelle in synne and the veray medecyne is confessyon. And certeyn lytel pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seth he hys helthe. that seeth hym self seek to the deth / and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syreth not to be guarysshed and helyd. ¶Also the deth whiche is nyghe and alle aboute to espye the synnar· ought to moeue and excyte hym hastelye to confesse hym. For he knoweth not the day. the houre. ne the poynte or mynute whan the dethe shal come. whyche surpryseth ofte the synnar. there. where he taketh none hede.

For he is in the holde and pryson of synne and in the throte of the lyon of helle. and of the dragon that wyl deuoure hym / he shold hastely goo to confessyon / &amp; that assone as he myght. ¶ Also a synnar ought to see what he hath loste by hys synne. the goodes perdurable and the goodes spyrytuel. Hys tyme and hym self whyche he myght al reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure by deuoute confessyon. Moche thenne were he a fool yf he hasted not to recouure that whyche he had loste.</p>

For that he ought to haste hym to be confessyd / For of as moche as god abydeth so longe the synnar. of soo moche is hys Iustyce more harde and more cruel whan he seeth hym slowe and neclygente. For lyke as the archyer gyueth to hys bowe more bente / and

tharbalester to the crosse bowe soo moche more smyteth it the harder and stronger. And certeynlye god hath his bowe bente and redy to loze as sayth the Psaulter for to slee the synnars yf they wyl not conuerte them. and yf they take not good hede ¶ Also the synnar that ouerlonge taryeth to confesse hym / forgeteth ofte hys synnes. Soo that it happeth that vnnethe that he is wel and truly confessyd. For he forgeteth many synnes whyche he shal neuer remembre. and so of them shall he neuer repente. ne neuer be confessed / of whyche it is to hym grete perylle. ¶Also whan a synnar is tofore hys confessour he ought to expresse and saye hys synnes clerely. so that hys confessour see euydently hys herte / and al thentencyon of hym that confesseth hym. For the seek man ought to dyscoure his maladye vnto the physycyen. ellys the physycyen myght not werke. Ne the Surgyen ne myght not hele the sore but yf he sawe the wounde. And therfore sayth the wyse man / yf thou wylt that the Surgyan hele the. thou must dyscouere to hym thy wounde or sore. ¶Thenne the truaunte and the lame <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Thus thenne ought the synnar to dyscouer hys synnes to hys confessour for to haue mercy· and thys is the thyrd condycyon. that ought to be in confessyon. ¶Also the synnar ought to confesse hym entyerly and hooly / this is the fourth condycyon. For he ought to saye alle hys synnes grete and lytel and alle the cyrcumstaunces of the synnes· Thenne he ought fyrst to by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>holde the dedely synnes· of whyche I haue spoken tofore. and to confesse hym hooly of eueryche of them / after that he feleth hym culpable. wythoute to hyde ony thynge. and wythoute sayeng more / and wythoute excusyng hym· and wythoute to accuse ony other. ¶ Ryght soo confessyd hym Dauyd that sayth in the Psaulter / I shalle confesse me and shal saye all my synne ayenst me. and not ayenst other. lyke as ypocrytes
<pb facs="tcp:9643:109"/>
whyche put alwaye the fayrest outward / and telle theyr good dedes and hyde theyr euyl dedes. And accusen other of that. whyche they them self be more culpable of. For they see wel a lytel festue or a lytel mote in the eyen of other. and beholde not a grete beme or blocke whyche is in theyr owen eyen / that is to saye the grete synnes that been in them. Suche was the pharyse of whome the gospel sayth that he remembred hys good dedes. and despysed the publycan that humbly smote his breste in the temple. and cryed God mercy and sayd. Lord god haue pyte and mercy on me poure synnar. Thus ought the synnar Iuge hym self tofore god. &amp; not aledge hys synne but to agryeue. poyse· and recounte clerely wythoute lyeng. ¶ Also confessyon ought to be hole. and not departed to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers confessours· For it ought to be sayd alle to one confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour / and not one parte to one / and another parte to another god loueth not suche departyng. ¶ Also a man ought not to saye onelye the synnes. but alle the cyrcumstaunces whyche agreuen moche the synnes. For the synnes ben perauenture more grete in one persone than in another. as in a relygyous man more than in a seculer. In a prelate than in a symple man. ¶ Also thys is more grete synne in one place than in another / as in a monasterye· or in ony other holy place· more than in an vnhalowed place / also in one tyme more than in another. as in lente or on festeful dayes / ¶Also whan one synneth wytyngly and in ernest. he synneth more than whan one synneth ygnorantlye. ¶ Also one ought for to saye the condycyon of the synne. For it is gretter synne with a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded woman than wyth a syngle. Or in a man or woman of relygyon· or in a persone ordeyned a preest or a deken. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the ordre and the estate is more grete. so moche is the synne more grete. ¶Also yf the synne be ayenste nature and how longe tyme he hath duellyd in the sayd synnes. also he ought to say yf he haue lytel or nought resysted and wyth

Fyrst he ought to goo to hys herte. and saye alle hys synnes what someuer they be carnall or spyrytuel. Spyrytuel as ageynst the fayth or of vayne glorye. or of Enuye. of auaryce. of rancour. or of other maners. of whome there be many. The synnes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or bodely / apperteynen to the delytes of the flessh of the body or yf he haue not kept hym wel in alle thoughtes. that therin hath been consentyng· or longe abydyng. Or delyte. whyche somtyme is as moche as the consentyng. and of alle these thoughtes he ought to confesse. Also one ought to take hede yf he haue synned by the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres of his body. for a man synneth in them in many maners. Fyrst in the hede / whan one setteth ouer grete cure and grete costes to dresse it. as done these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes &amp; wymmen. whyche so curyously araye theyr hede with precyous adournementes for pure vanyte &amp; for to playse and drawe men to synne.

And thus the confessyon is good and hool. whan one sayth alle hys synnes grete and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. and thys is the fourth condycyon that ought to be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessyon. ¶The fyfthe condycyon is that one ought for to confesse hym humbly / For the synnar speketh to god whyche seeth al his hert. Thenne the confessour is but the ere of god and that whyche he hereth. ne knoweth not as a man· but as god. And the synnar ought to telle hys synnes wyth grete drede. and ought to opene his hert and poure it abrode that it flowe ouer. lyke as one shedeth oute a ful potte of water wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the water is poured out there abydeth noo colour· as doth of mylke ne odour. as of wyn ne sauour ne tast as of hony· thus shold noo thynge be reteyned of the synne. sythe it hath be said in confessyon· Ne the colour.

Also one ouzt to leue the sauour &amp; taste of synne. he reteyneth the sauour of synne· that thynketh on the synnes that he hath doon / And delyteth hym in the remembraunce of them and pleseth hym / ¶ But he ought for to thynke vpon them in grete drede. that he falle neuer nomore in them.

Fyrst for to gete more gretter grace and more meryte ayenst god. lyke as the lynnen cloth whyche is ofte wasshen / is the more whyte. Also for the venyall synnes that one falleth in ofte / he ought to wasshe hym. Also for to chace and dryue awaye the deuyl fro hym. and for to be oute of hys thraldom and of hys nette.

This is the fyrst braunche of the tree of prowesse in them that vaynquysshe synne. After thys bataylle cometh another. For whan a man repenteth hym of his synne. thenne cometh a newe wrastlyng to his hert. what penaunce he may doo. and what lyf he may lede / And there be many of them that in this bataylle be recreaunte. For lyke as god sayth in the gospel. Now they byleue. Now they byleue not. Now they wyl / now they wyl not. Now they purpose / Now is alle nought. For they be not ferme ne estable. ne perseueraunte. But whan a man Ioyneth hym to god / and affermeth hys herte and hys good purpoos to hym / thenne is thys bataylle good &amp; goten / and thenne god maketh hym ferme and stable as is a pyler in the chirche. as sayth saynt Iohan. Thys is the second vyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye &amp; the rewarde that answereth to hym. after this wras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlyng cometh the iij wrastlyng that a man hath to his flesshe. which moche complayneth wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it begynneth to fele the hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse &amp; sharpnesse of penaunce. &amp; it reenforceth to come ageyn to hir olde customes. the flesshe is an euyl wyf. wherof salamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sayth. who moste doth the wylle of the flesshe. the wers it is. &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:9643:112"/>
more is to hym contrarye. And who that suffreth his flesshe to ouercome hym. he entreth and putteth hym self in grete ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uytude. For there is none so foule a thynge as to be ouercom of his flesshe / who that vaynquyssheth thys bataylle. god pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytteth to hym a newe crowne whyt of chastyte &amp; of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencye. &amp; bryngeth hym to reste / that is the glorye perdurable lyke as he saith in thapocalypse. after this batayl cometh this world and dame fortune with hir whele· whiche assaylleth a man on the ryght syde and on the lyft syde / whiche been two stronge bataylles. where as moche peple ben vaynquysshed / &amp; moo be vaynquysshed on the ryght syde than on the lyft syde / lyke as dauyd sayth in his psaulter. For more stronge is the temptacion that cometh of the ryght syde. than it that cometh on the lyft. as dauyd sayth in his psaulter. For more stronge is the temptacyon that cometh of honoure of rychesses and of delytes which the deuyl offreth &amp; setteth before. tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which cometh of aduersyte. lyke as pouertres &amp; the maladyes &amp; the sekenesses that god sendeth / &amp; he that vaynquyssheth and that despyseth with his hert the prosperytees of this world. God promytteth to hym honour and hyenesse in glorye. for he shal make hym sytte wyth hym in his trone as saith thapocalipse To hym that shal vaynquysshe that other bataylle whiche is on the lyft syde in thaduersytees of this world god promyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth glorye which no man may take fro hym. The vj batayll which is moche stronge / is ayenst the wycked that ben in the world which ben the membres of antecryste which warren ayenst the good men by theyr myght. lyke as dyd of olde tyme the tyrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. aye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st the marters &amp; good crysten men. for vnnethe shal none dar reclame hym crysten for the strengthe of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryst &amp; of his membres. Thys is the beest that Iohan sawe that warryd the sayntes of whyche we haue tofore spoken· The membres of this beest shewen them in wycked prynces and euyll prelates. whyche by theyr grete couetyse defoule
<pb facs="tcp:9643:112"/>
flee and eten theyr subgettes. so that the good men that been vnder them haue ynough to suffre and many dyseases &amp; grete myschyeues· But they that take al in good pacyence without murmure as dyd Iob. and truste al in god they vaynquysshe this batayl. and to hym that shal ouercome it. god promyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to hym that he shal gyue to hym power ouer his enemy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es· lyke as saynt Iohan sayth in thapocalyps. After alle these bataylles cometh the laste which is moost stronge. for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl whiche is malycious &amp; moche subtyl. whan he seeth that a man is mounted vpon the moutayn of perfection. and hath ouercomen al these bataylles aforesaid. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne assaylleth hym the fende by vaynglorye / &amp; by presumpcion. for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne it semeth to hym that he is a moche good man. &amp; grete frende of god by this that he hath al suffred for hym by which he falleth som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme from hye to lowe as dyd lucyfer / &amp; therfore it is grete necessyte that a man be wyse. and that he kepe hym from the synne of vaynglorye. whyche maketh the ryergarde. For in the taylle lyeth ofte the venym. and thenconforaunce. and som<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyme the shyppe that is nyghe to the porte peryssheth· whyche wente surely in the hye see. Thenne hym byhoueth that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye and addresse hys saylle. That is al his entencyon &amp; alle his hert at the porte of helthe. That is to Ihesu Cryste by the wynde of feruent loue and of grete desyre of god. This is the hungre of Iustyce of whyche we haue spoken tofore. whyche cometh of the yefte of strengthe and of the vertu of prowesse. As the good Knyght whyche is noble and hardy / that hath a good herte. and that hath been in many presses. whyche hath grete talente and grete hungre to shewe his strengthe in tournoyes or in bataylles for to gete to hym pryse and reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee / And certeynly who that hath grete loue to god &amp; grete hungre and desyre of his helthe he ouercometh lyghtlye thys last bataylle. he wyl not ne desyreth not in thys lyf. but that whyche is vnto the honour and to the glorye of God. And
<pb facs="tcp:9643:113"/>
to the helthe of his soule. and who that vaynquyssheth thys bataylle shal wynne the rewarde. of whyche saynt Iohan spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth in thappocalypse there where our lord sayth. that to hym that shal vaynquysshe he shal gyue to hym to ete of the tree of lyf. whyche is in the myddle of paradyse. That is Ihesu Cryst hym self that gyueth lyf perdurable of whyche alle the sayntes lyuen in the glorye of heuen. and al been fulfylled and been in reste / And this is the blessyng of whyche the debonayr Ihesu Cryst promytteth in the gospel to hys good knyghtes whan he sayd. blessyd be they that haue hungre and thyrste of Iustyce / that is to serue god and to loue hym / For they shal be fulfylled of the fruyte of the tree of lyf. That is the ende and the perfectyon of this vertu whyche is called prowesse. to whyche ledeth the yefte of strengthe.</p>

No byrde eteth another byrde of his owne nature / Ne a beest also eteth not another beest of his owne nature / Also the same book saith that a mare nouryssheth the foole of another mare. whan she is dede. Also it hath ofte be seen &amp; preuyd that a wulfe hath nourysshed the whelpes of another wulfe / and hath defended

For we al be made of one matere &amp; one forme &amp; one ymage. The second thynge that ought to drawe a man to mercy &amp; to compassyon of another mannes harme is grace. For we al be membres of one body / that is of holy chyrche by grace / and one membre helpeth another naturelly. &amp; hath pyte &amp; compassyon. Also we be bouzt &amp; redemed with one prys. that is with the precyous blode of Ihesu cryst. that henge on the crosse for to redeme vs fro deth perdurable / whan our saueour Ihesu Cryst was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne soo pyetous &amp; mercyful toward vs. wel ought we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to haue pyte &amp; compassyon one of another. &amp; to ayde &amp; socour that one that other.

The thyrd thynge that ought to moeue a man to mercy is the comandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the holy scrypture whych cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceylleth &amp; commandeth the werkes of mercy aboue alle o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thynges / wherof the wyse Salamon sayth. See wel to sayth he that thy hede be not wythout oylle. for by thoylle that nouryssheth the fyre &amp; the lampe. is vndersto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den mercy. which ought alwaye to be in our tonnes.

he wold saye / That may not be. For the oylle of mercy is faylled in the lampe of his hert / Also the good thobye taught hys sone &amp; sayd thus. Fayre sone be thou mercyful / as moche as thou mayst / yf thou haue plente of goodes gyue gladly &amp; largely. yf thou haue lytel yet of the same yeue gladly to the poure. And our lord sayth in the gospel. Goo sayd he &amp; selle al that thou hast and gyue it to the poure. This is the vertue that the holy scrypture prayseth moost generally. And it is the vertu that moost playseth god as the scrypture sayth. Herof sayth god by the prophete. I wyl sayth he mercy &amp; not sacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyse. And Saynt austyn sayth that there is no thynge that so moche maketh a man amyable vnto god as doth pyte. and to haue mercy on other. Moche peple do seruyse and sacrefyse to god in fastynges or in pylgremages. or in sharpe penaunce of the body. but to do almesse. they ben scarce caytyf &amp; strayte. Also moche people of grete estate to whome god hath gyuen lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely of his temporell goodes do sacryfyse &amp; seruyse not to god. but to the world. or to the deuyl in that. that they dyspende fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyly theyr goodes in vanytees and in oultrages / and in honou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res of the world. But for to gyue fo goddes sake to the poure they ben harde as ademont. ¶ Also lyke as mercy pleseth to god. ryght so despleaseth it to the deuyl. For it is the armure and the vertu by whyche he is moost sonnest vaynquysshed. as is said in a glose vpon the psaulter / he may not suffre the good odour of suche an oyneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te. Nomore than the crapaulde may fele the smellyng or odour of the vygne. Thys odour myght not Iudas smelle ne fele whan the holy Maudeleyne enoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the heed of Ihesu Cryste wyth the precyous oynement. For it semed to Iudas that it was a thynge loste. and had leuer the money that it coste in hys purs by couetyse. Of suche peple that be thus couetous and auarycyous is lord &amp; mays<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a deuyl that is called closepurs / whome an holy hermyte sawe. that he had the offyce to close and shette the purses of
<pb facs="tcp:9643:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
couetous men. that they shold not be opened to doo almesse. The fourth thynge that ought to moeue a man to mercy / is the grete largesse of our lord / whyche gyueth largely to euery man after that they be / as sayth Saynt Iames. and maketh his sonne to shyne vpon the good and vpon the euyl / lyke as it is sayd in the gospel. Sythe that the debonayr Ihesus is so large to vs· that he gyueth to vs. and hath gyuen. alle that we haue that is good. we ought to be large and curtoys that one anenste that other. For so commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to vs god in the gospel whan he sayth / Be ye mercyful / lyke as your fader of heuen is mercyful. He ought to resemble his fader. &amp; ought to ensyewe hym whan he is good and wyse. Or otherwyse he forsaketh hym. and therfore sayth the wyse man in scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Be ye mercyful &amp; pyetous to the poure &amp; to the orphans lyke as thou were theyr fader or theyr moder / be thou as their husbond. and thus shalt thou be called the sone of god. ¶The fyfthe thynge that ought to moeue a man to mercy is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of god. For as Salamon sayth. he honoureth our lord that dooth wel to the poure. For that whyche is doon to the poure. is don vnto god lyke as hym self wytnesseth in the gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel. That whyche ye haue doon to one of the leest of my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes. ye haue doon to me / this sayth god. The poure ben the lytel meyne of our lord. who so honoureth them by the wer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kys of mercy he honoureth god. For who honoureth the mey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne he honoureth the lord. and who that dooth vylonye to the famylye and seruauntes. dooth vylanye to the lord. ¶ Herof haue we a fayre and a good ensaumple of the holy saynt mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyn. To whome god appyeryd in the nyght. after that he had departed and gyuen hys mantel to the pour man. and he was couerd wyth the sayd mantel. and god sayd to hys angellys Martyn hath clad me wyth thys vestement. ¶ The syxthe thynge that ought moche to moeue a man to mercy / is the drede of the Iugement. For as sayth saynt Iames Iugement
<pb facs="tcp:9643:116"/>
wythoute mercy shal be doo to hym that dooth not the wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of mercy. For lyke as god sayth in the gospel. whan the day of Iugement shal come / the sentence shal be gyuen ayenst them that haue not to theyr power doon and accomplysshed the werkes of mercy. For god shal leye a deef eere to them that now leye a deef eere to the poure. lyke as it appyereth in the exaumple that he recounteth of the ryche man that wold gyue none almesse to Lazare / and by cause he refused to gyue to hym almesse. god refused to hym a drope of water whan he was in the fyre of helle / In lyke wyse dyd he to the folysshe vyrgyns that had none oylle in theyr lampes. God closed to them the yate at the weddyng and sayd to them I knowe you not. and so they abode wythoute and came not in. Ryght soo shal it be doo at the day of Iugemente to the auarycyous and to the couetous men whyche haue not the conduytes of mercy whyche ledeth the soules to heuen. and maketh to them a ryzt waye to come tofore god as holy scrypture sayth. Lyke as waye is made &amp; the yate opened to hym that bryngeth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente. Certeynlye acursed shal he be by ryght to whome pyte and mercy shal torne theyr backe at the day of Iugemente. whan god shal gyue sentence soo ferme. stable. and dredefull For it shal be so establysshed by Iustyce and confermed. that it shal neuer be repeled. And thenne shal god do as souerayn pope bysshop &amp; kynge / caste oute hys grete excomynycacyon. For he is kyng and bysshop as sayth the scrypture. for he took <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

They shal be wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked people whome god shal curse for theyr synnes &amp; for theyr falsehede. Thus shal he say to them. Goo ye wycked &amp; cursed in to the fyre of helle perdurably / whyche is ordeyned to thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryble deuyls / and to them that haue doon theyr wylle. Alas thys sentence how wel that it is shorte. certeynlye it shalle be
<pb facs="tcp:9643:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ouer anguysshous and ouer harde whan Ihesus Cryst shalle chase them oute of hys companye. Suche harde a departyng ought moche to be doubted. ¶The seuenth thynge that ought moche to moeue a persone to mercy. is the fruyt and the good that groweth of thys tree. whych appyereth in many maners Fyrst in that whyche mercy geteth pardon to synnars. Of whyche mercy hath the lettres of pardon and of Indulgence. For god sayth in the gospel. Blessyd be the mercyful. for they shal haue mercy. After in the same letter sayth he. yf we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done not that one the other / god shal not pardone vs. ¶Also mercy is the good marchaunts purs. whyche wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth oueral. &amp; neuer leseth. For as sayth saynt Poul. mercy auaylleth to alle thynges. A precyouse stone shold be moche worthe. that shold be good for alle thynges. That is mercy whyche wynneth the goodes temporell. the goodes spyrytuell / and the goodes perdurable of glorye. Of the goodes temporell sayth salamon. honoure god of thy rychessys &amp; of thy goodes temporell gyue to the poure. and god shal replenysshe thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of whete / &amp; thy celyers of wyne / But vnderstonde wel this word. that he sayth of thy rychessys and of thy goodes / and not the goodes of other / as doon somme that wyl doo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>messes of that whyche they haue taken fro other by force. by rauyne / by vsure. or by other euyl cause. and maken ofte of other mennes lether large thonges· But of thyn owne propre good whyche thou holdest truly honoure god. For that other thou art bounden to yelde and rendre ageyn. ¶ Also he sayth that thou gyue to the poure and not to the ryche. and god shall yelde to the an hondred double therfore. lyke as he sayth in the gospel. Mercy is a seed that fructefyeth better in the lene londe than it doth in fatte. How that mercy multeplyeth the goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des temporell we haue many fayre ensaumples. of whyche I wyl remembre so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me here. ¶ It is sayd of saynt Germayn of Ancerre· that whan he came fro Rome. as he went oute of

the prayer may not be enhaunced tofore god yf it come not fro the hert. lyke as a messager whyche bryngeth noo letters. ne hath noo knowleche. entreth not gladly tofore the kynge. Oryson or prayer wythout deuocyon is as a messager wyth oute letters. who suche message sendeth to the courte. he dooth euyl his erandes· who thenne wyl praye god veryly. he ought to crye to god fro the depthe of his hert. as dyd dauyd / whyche sayd in the psaulter. lord god here my wys / For I crye to the fro the depnesse of my herte.

Thus ought we strongely to crye to god ayenst the fyre of couetyse. or of lecherye. that he gyue to vs the water of teres for to quenche suche fyre that hit enflamme not our hertes. Also we ought to crye to god ayenste the euyl thoughtes that come ofte to the hert. that the hert and the soule perysshe not by consentyng. Therfore cryed Dauyd to god and sayd. Lord saue me. and kepe me fro the perylle of waters. whyche ben now entred in to my hert. &amp; the dyscyples of our lord whan they sawe the tempest of the see vpon them they cryed sayeng lord saue vs for we been in grete perylle.

The first leef is the hool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thy body / that is to say that the body be entyer and hool without corrupco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n of lecherye.

<pb facs="tcp:9643:145"/>
and the rewarde of virgynyte. wherof Saynt Lucye vyrgyn &amp; martyr sayd to the tyraunte. yf thou corrupte me ayenst my wylle. my chastyte shal be doubled as touchyng the meryte of the crowne of glory. The second leef of vyrgynyte is clennesse of hert. For lyke as saynt Iherome sayth nought auaylleth to haue vyrgynyte of the body· that hath wylle for to marye hym or hyr. he speketh of them that hath auowed chastyte. For who that hath auowed to kepe vyrgynyte or chastyte. he ought to kepe his hert clene and chaste. The thyrd leef of vyrgynyte· is humylyte. For vyrgynyte wyth pryde pleaseth not god / And therfore sayth saynt bernard that it is a moche fayre thynge of humylyte wyth vyrgynyte. And that soule moche pleaseth to god that in humylyte gyueth preysyng of vyrgynyte / &amp; vyrgynyte embelyssheth humylyte / I dare wel say sayth he that wythoute humylyte. the vyrgynyte of our la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy saynt marye had neuer pleased our lord. The fourth leef of the lylye of vyrgynyte is drede of god. For they that ben ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ray vyrgynes ben woned to be tymerous ferful &amp; shamefast / &amp; that is no meruayle / For they bere a moche precyous tresour in a moche feble vessel. Thenne our blessyd lady the vyrgyn marie was alwaye hyd &amp; had drede whan the aungel appye<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red to hyr. But the drede of god is the tresorer which kepeth the tresour of virgynyte. which the deuyl may not take awaye for it kepeth the yates of the castel. wherin the tresour is enclo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed. The yates of the castel of the hert where the tresour of vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gynyte is in. ben the wittes of the body. These yates kepen the drede of god. that they be not opened to the enemye of helle. by vayn curyosyte of seeyng or of heeryng. or of smellyng. of spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kyng. or tastyng / or goyng in euyl companye. For curiosyte of seeyng or of heeryng the vanytees of the world ben waye &amp; cause of the synne of lecherye. wherof is sayd in the scrypture that Dyna doughter of Iacob whan she went musyng by cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riosyte to see the wymmen of the contre. where anone she was
<pb facs="tcp:9643:145"/>

This is the sence of the v vyrgynes of whome our lord sayth in the gospel. whan he sayd that the royame of heuen is lyke to x vyrgynes / of whome fyue were wyse. &amp; the other fyue were fooles. He calleth here the royame of heuen holy chyrche. whych is bynethe in this world. wherin been alwaye good &amp; euyl. foles &amp; wyse· whyche ben membres of holy chyrche. by the fayth that they haue receyued in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesme. The fyue wyse vyrgyns sygnefye them that kepe and gouerne wel the fyue wyttes of the body of whiche we haue spoken. The fyue vyrgyns foles sygnefye them that folysshly kepe them. ¶The v leef is sharpenes of the lyf of penaunce. For who wyl kepe vyrgynyte / he muste moche chastyse hys flesshe &amp; subdue it by penaunce / &amp; that the body do the wylle of the soule by fastyng. by wakyng in prayers. &amp; other penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces Sharpnesse of lyf is lyke a stronge hedge for to kepe the gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyn of the hert. that the euyl beestes assaylle it not / that ben the fendes of helle to thende that they may not entre. whyche en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende &amp; studye for to stele &amp; take awaye the tresour of vyrgy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyte / &amp; therfore ought this tresour to be wel enclosed and wel kepte that it be not loste. For who that leseth it may neuer recouer it. no more than the lampe that is broken may not be made hole ageyn / ¶The vj leef of vyrgynyte is perseuerau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that is to haue ferme purpoos to kepe wel that is promysed to god. wherof Saynt austyn sayth in the book of vyrgynyte &amp; adresseth his wordes to the virgyns sayeng. Folowe ye the lambe sayth he. that is Ihesu Cryst· in kepyng stronglye that whyche ye haue auowed to god. Do ardauntly as moche as ye may / that the wele of vyrgynyte perysshe not in you. For ye may not doo that thynge / by whyche vyrgynyte may be

recouerd. yf it were loste / lyke as we haue shewde by ensaum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of the lampe / &amp; Saynt Bernard sayth. estudye ye to the vertu of perseueraunce. for she onely wynneth and geteth the crowne of glorye. The syethe leef aforsayd enbelyssheth and maketh moche fayr the lylye of vyrgynyte. but it byhoueth to haue withinforth thre graynes of golde. whiche sygnefyen iij maners to loue god. ¶For vyrgynyte wythoute loue is lyke as a lampe wythout oyle. wherfore the fooles vyrgyns by cause they fylled not theyr lampes of this oylle. were shette oute fro the weddyng. and the wyse vyrgyns that fylled theyr lampes of this oyle entred in to the weddyng with the spouse The thre maners for to loue god whych ben sygnefyed by the thre graynes of the lylye / saynt austyn enseygneth them whan he sayth thus / Thou shalt loue god wyth alle thyn entende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without errour / with al thy wylle without gaynsayeng and with al thy mynde wythout forgetyng. In suche maner is thymage of god parfayte in a man after iij dignytees that ben in the lyf. That is to wete / entendement. memorye. and wylle. whan these iij thynges ben wel ordeyned to god· the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ben the thre graynes of gold of the lyly / of the gold of charyte whyche gyueth bounte. beaute. and valure of alle vertue. For wythout this golde no vertu is tofore god neyther fayr ne pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyouse / Otherwyse sayth saynt bernard of the manere to loue god and sayth thus. O thou that arte a crysten man. lerne how thou oughtest to loue god. lerne to loue hym wysely / swetely and strongely. wysely that thou be not deceyued by ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cete. Swetely that thou be not moeued by prosperyte. Stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely that thou be not ouercomen by aduersyte / In this maner is fayr the flour delys of vyrgynyte. whan she is suche as is sayd tofore. &amp; this is the second reason by whyche thestate of vyrgynyte ought moche to be preysed for her beaute. The thyrd reason wherfore thestate of virgynyte ought moche to be prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is for hir bounte &amp; for the prouffyt that cometh of it. For
<pb facs="tcp:9643:146"/>
virgynyte is a tresour of so grete value that it may not be prey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed. wherof the scrypture sayth that no thynge is worthy to be compared to a chaste hert / of the chastyte of virgynyte / for virgynyte aboue al other estates bereth the moost grettest fruyt &amp; the moost grettest proffyt. They that ben in maryage &amp; kepe it wel as they ouzt to doo haue the xxx folde fruyt. They that ben in wydowhede haue the lx folde fruyt. But they that kepe virgynyte haue the hondred folde fruyt. For lyke as our lord sayth in the gospel that the seed that falleth in good lande ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth fruyt xxx folde. lx folde / &amp; an hondred folde / These iij nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bres xxx / lx. &amp; an hondred apperteyne to iij estates toforesayd / The nombre of xxx / whiche is of x thre tymes whyche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken xxx apperteyneth to thestate of maryage / where ought to be kept the x comandements of the lawe in the fayth of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trynyte. The nombre of lx is more grete &amp; is of xvj tymes For vj tymes x maken lx. &amp; apperteyneth to thestate of wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhede. For in suche estate ought to be kept the x comande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. &amp; wyth them ought to be accomplysshed the seuen wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of mercy of whyche we haue spoken tofore.
