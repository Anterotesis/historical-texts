            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHen Man firſt tranſgreſſed and was driven out from God, God placed <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and a <hi>flaming Sword,</hi> to keep the Way of the Tree of Life: Mark, to keep the <hi>Way</hi> of the Tree of Life from the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor;</hi> for, againſt him that did <hi>tranſgreſs,</hi> was the <hi>flaming Sword</hi> and the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> which God placed to keep the Way of the Tree of Life; for then man had no right to the Life, but Condemnation; the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims</hi> and the <hi>flaming Sword</hi> is againſt him, through which he muſt come before he comes to Life again. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> (who was commanded to do all things according to the Patern which he ſaw on the Mount) when he preſcribes a way to God, and to the Mercy, even in the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he ſpeaks of the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and deſcribes them to be two, beat out of one piece of Gold, and made of the Mercy-Seat: Now mark, that out of which the Cherubims were beat, out of the Mercy-Seat, to over-ſhadow it; and the <hi>Mercy-Seat</hi> is over-ſhadowed while the <hi>Cherubims</hi> remain (while the Tranſgreſſion is) and the <hi>Condemnation</hi> to the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor;</hi> for that ſpreads it ſelf over the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> and the Mercy-Seat that is not known, nor the Golden-Pot where Manna is, while Man continues in the <hi>Tranſgreſſion:</hi> for the <hi>Seed,</hi> which is the Seat of Mercy (was figured forth by the piece of Gold, and the Mercy-Seat of Gold, out of which the Cherubims were) that lies under, and the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony, or witneſſing for God (out of which the Judgment, and the burning which delivers from the Tranſgreſſion comes) that is not known, and the Way unto the Tree of Life again, is by that which brings out of thoſe things which the <hi>Cherubims</hi> and the <hi>flaming Sword</hi> were againſt, which remained even through <hi>Moſes;</hi> for the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Service which he preſcribed, could not take away Sin to the purifying the Conſcience, for which cauſe the Cherubims <hi>over-ſhadowed</hi> the Mercy-Seat; for the way was not yet prepared, until Chriſt came: So, though they had Ordinances of Divine Service, and a worldly San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony, which was called the <hi>Holieſt of all;</hi> yet notwithſtanding theſe things, (which were but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of good things to come) the Mercy-Seat was over-ſhadowed, (the Vail remained over peoples hearts, and they could not approach near unto God without a Sacrifice for Sin, for fear of Wrath) and they could not ſee through the <hi>Cherubims of glory,</hi> but periſhed in that <hi>they abode in Sin,</hi> and that which the <hi>Cherubims of glory, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap>t, which keeps them from the Tree of Life: So they being out of the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> they were out of that unto which the <hi>Mercy</hi> is.</p>
            <p>Well, but ſome men may ſay, <hi>Theſe things were indeed added after Tranſgreſſion, and ſpoken of by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but ſince Chriſt came, they are taken away, ſo that we have the Seat of Mercy, and can ſee it with open face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To thee, whoſoever thou art that ſhalt ſay thus, I give anſwer; The Apoſtle, who ſpake of thoſe things, ſaid, <hi>the ſum of all is CHRIST;</hi> and that which was directed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was but <hi>the ſhadow of good things to come, but the Body is CHRIST.</hi> Now mark, Chriſt ſayes, <hi>I come not to bring Peace on Earth, but a Sword,</hi> and a <hi>Fire;</hi> and what will I, if it be already kindled? <hi>And this is the condemnation, that LIGHT is come into the World,</hi> Joh. 3. 19. So that his coming, is <hi>not to deſtroy the Law,</hi> but <hi>to eſtabliſh it,</hi> and to deſtroy <hi>that</hi> which the Law <hi>is againſt:</hi> Now the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Law is <hi>taken away by Chriſt,</hi> for them that believe; but the <hi>flaming Sword</hi> and the <hi>Cherubims remain</hi> in the <hi>Condemnation;</hi> for the <hi>Cherubims</hi> are <hi>two,</hi> made of the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> even the <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which <hi>remains,</hi> and are continued and eſtabliſhed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> againſt <hi>Tranſgreſſion;</hi> and none can have the <hi>Mercy</hi> while they <hi>continue</hi> in their <hi>Tranſgreſſion:</hi> Alas for thee, that thinkeſt theſe things can be taken away, ſo long as <hi>Sin remains;</hi> thou canſt not ſee into thoſe things which concern thy <hi>Peace;</hi> for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> and the <hi>Death</hi> will take hold of thee while thou art in thy <hi>ſins,</hi> and the <hi>Seed</hi> thou canſt not ſee, which is the <hi>true Seat of Mercy,</hi> and the <hi>Tabernacle of the Testimony</hi> for God, which the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of, which is the <hi>fulfilling of all thoſe things,</hi> and the <hi>way to God,</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi> which is to be come into, through the <hi>condemning</hi> and <hi>deſtroying</hi> the <hi>ſins,</hi> and the <hi>ſinful part;</hi> So by the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> all theſe things are ſeen, and read through; which gift is <hi>Light,</hi> which as all come to ſee, and wait in it, in Obedience to its working againſt <hi>Sin,</hi> it will make way into the <hi>Holieſt of all,</hi> and raiſe up the <hi>Seed,</hi> which is the <hi>Seat of Mercy,</hi> and the <hi>Tabernacle of Witneſs for God</hi> (in which the Life is, which is the <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Manna,</hi> anſwering to the <hi>Golden Pot,</hi> in which the <hi>Manna</hi> was, and he is the Miniſter of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and the <hi>true Tabernacle,</hi> confirmed by a greater thing than <hi>Aarons Rod</hi> which budded, by him that ſaid,
