            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Lordship, the best judg of Writers, will
not I hope condemn me, for inscribing your
name to the History of <hi>Famianus Strada.</hi>
He is indeed a Modern <hi>Roman,</hi> but in
happiness and freedom of expression, so like
the Ancients, <hi>Livy, Sallust,</hi> and <hi>Tacitus:</hi> that 'tis no
injury to the past, or present World, to say, their Age pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
not his Superiour, nor ours his Equal; since those
that have not arrived to his perfection may be good Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;
those that have, eminent. The Fame of so great
an Authour, made me ambitious to interpret him to my
Countrey: not considering (for I as willingly acknowledg
my Errour as his Merit) that I was to Copie a Principal,
comprehending new and various Narrations, Princes
Letters, Speeches, Debates and Results of Cabinets and
Councel-tables, Battells, Descriptions of places, Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
<pb facs="tcp:41239:3"/>
of Persons, and very prudent Observations, summed
up in brief sentences. Besides, I found all these apparelled
in the most captivating Figures of the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue: not
like the <hi>French, Spanish,</hi> or other Languages of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
easily reducible to those now spoken; but hard to be
rendred in any; especially in <hi>English.</hi> Yet after I had
ingaged, that I might play my game to the fairest, I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
the invention of <hi>Alexander Farneze,</hi> when he
dissected Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> in the <hi>Low-countreys:</hi>
and had him shewed in <hi>Spain,</hi> new-joynted skinned and
almost spirited, to <hi>Philip</hi> the second. In imitation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I took to pieces the actions of Don <hi>John, Alexander
Farneze,</hi> and the rest of their famous friends and enemies,
as they were described in <hi>Italy:</hi> and present them <hi>here</hi> to
your Lordship, like the parts of Don <hi>John's</hi> body, <hi>intire,</hi>
although not <hi>breathing.</hi> For which I can make no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie,
but that 'tis the fortune of this History to be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to Princes. And when the first Dedication was
made to the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> it concerned me to address
the second to a person of like honour: and my Genius di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
me to such a one, in whom Eminence of Dignity is
joyned with Eminence of knowledg, that affording me Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage;
this, reputation. For what <hi>Ammianus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus</hi>
reports of Physitians, that they were held <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
if they had once been at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> we know to

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHo ever thou art, that shalt vouchsafe to take
my Book in thy hands, before thou peruse
it, give me leave to preface a few things.
Thou hast here a History of mine, which I
cannot exspect should be either praised or
pardoned for expedition, being nine years
old, before I sent it to the Presse: yet for that very procrasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
I may hope another as great a favour from my Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
because it was out of my respect to him, that I spun out
time in polishing my work. For albeit, many years ago di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
persons (to whose Abilities no lesse then to their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
none in <hi>Rome</hi> but yields) having read the first part of
my Annals, gave them farre more then common approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet they could not perswade me (that know how great
the difference is betwixt Humanity and Judgement) to hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the publishing of them: or, now they are published, not
to be an earnest Suiter to my Reader for some favourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
due to my Modesty, reverencing others judgements.
This Civilitie I the rather hope, for that my fortune is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
better, then ordinary Historians: For I give thee Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Letters, most of them writ with their own hands. I give
thee Embassadours private instructions, secret Councels of
Warre, Causes of Designes, Notes brought in by Spies, clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine
conspiracies of Towns, and many other Particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which either by Pieces, or collected into Diaries, have
been discovered to me by the very men employed. And were
it not to trespasse upon the Readers Patience, I could (which
many times I do) to most of my Relations, annex the copyes
of the Letters, produce the credit of the Originals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to prove matter of Fact; as evidently, as Deeds signed,
sealed, and witnessed. But all these, as they have in a manner
<pb facs="tcp:41239:4"/>
opened to me a Door to look into Councel-chambers, and
Cabinets:<note place="margin">Polybius lib. 3.</note> So the divulging of them, and especially explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Individualls (without which <hi>Polybius</hi> thinks Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
but a mock-monument) must needs be so much sweeter to
the Readers longing, by how much they comparing common
Notions (which they have read in others, and therefore I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to mention) out of them and me together will frame a
more copious History. This likewise is the cause, that makes
me sometimes give an Account of particular Accidents; that
the <hi>Low-countrey</hi> warre, no lesse known from the mouth of
Fame, then penns of numerous Writers, might be varied by
such Additionals, pleasing for newnesse, and not inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with a particular History. This hath likewise made me,
that as I have passed over some things cursorily, and unlesse
some peculiar passage were to be added to others Relations,
almost quite omitted them: so many times to bring higher
deductions, I thought would be more acceptable, and not
done without many great examples. For among the Writers
of the <hi>Romane</hi> Annals (to say nothing of the <hi>Grecians</hi>) <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi>
and <hi>Sallust,</hi> how often do they piece out the smal threads
of their work,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> and cover them as it were with an embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derie.
<hi>Tacitus</hi> in his Histories (the five books omitting his
Annals you may soon run over) refutes those Authours,
that say the chief Officers of <hi>Otho's</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> his Army
deliberated, Whether it were not better, that they, refusing
to fight for <hi>wicked</hi> Princes, should choose a <hi>good one;</hi> and
taking his hint from thence, speaks at large, Of mens old
and inbred Ambition to compasse the Sovereigne power, Of
its Originall in the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> Of the contentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Senatours and Plebeians, Of <hi>Marius, Sylla, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey:</hi>
at length, <hi>But</hi> (sayes he) <hi>the repetition of our ancient
and present manners, hath very farre transported me now I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the course of my History,</hi> Proceed. Where he describes
the burning of the <hi>Capitol</hi> by the Souldiers,<note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> and subjoyns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is
own complaints upon it, accurately setting down, Who it
was that vowed it, who built it, who dedicated it; and who,
when it was destroyed, repaired it; though they were pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
familiar to the people.<note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> What of <hi>Serapis?</hi> whose pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
he draws, and with a prolix Digression commemorates
what opinions the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Priests held of her, not thinking
it a wrong to History. But he never conceived an Historian
<pb facs="tcp:41239:4"/>
might be freer, then in his description of the siege of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
From whence he takes occasion to speak of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
and Manners of the <hi>Iews,</hi> so profusely, and so far,<note place="margin">Lib. 5.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving

Meats, Of the Sabbath, Of Circumcision, Of the Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the soul, Of Balsom, Of Brimstone, and other spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialties;
as if he wrote the History of that Nation. And yet
<hi>Tacitus</hi> keeps within compasse, if you compare him with
<hi>Sallust,</hi> that is so frequent in Excursions. Nay, he himself
doth not dissemble it: For having taken a large, and indeed
unnecessitated scope, at last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounding a retreat, he sayes, <hi>But
I have gone too carelessely, and too farre, being nettled and vexed
at the Manners of the Town. Now I come to the matter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sallust.</note> Nor
did he keep to it for all this; but in the division of the King
dome between <hi>Iugurth</hi> and <hi>Adherbal,</hi> he amply discourses of
<hi>Africa,</hi> and its Inhabitants from their very beginning. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
licentiously inveighing against the Manners of <hi>Rome,</hi>
he copiously relates the causes of Faction between the Senate
and the People, and with a check for his own flying out, he
brings himself again into the way. Yet what he adds to this
Digression upon the By, concerning the <hi>Leptitans,</hi> exceeds the
other by many degrees. For having mentioned the citie of
<hi>Leptis,</hi> when he had spoken of its Founders, of its situation,
and Language, he wheels about, and for a Corollary brings
in an old History, not at all appertaining to the <hi>Leptitans.
For</hi> (sayes he) <hi>because following the businesse of the</hi> Leptitans, <hi>I
am come into this Region, I think it not amiss to set down a noble
and memorable action of two</hi> Carthaginians. Which told, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sparingly, nor timorously, he goes on again. But why
do I quote so many Presidents, when that one of <hi>Catilines</hi>
Conspiracy evidently shews, what liberty a Historian may
assume? the Writer whereof so freely digresses, and hath so
many Out-lets, and Parergons, that the additionall Matter
is much more then the fourth part of the Historie. Which
being granted, ours likewise, in case it be any where redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
will (I hope) be fairly interpreted by the Readers. As
likewise that, which I have not forborn, whilst I compare the
<hi>ancient</hi> with the <hi>modern</hi> times; that is, like to like: Which, as
I am not ignorant the <hi>Latines</hi> seldome do, so I know it is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar

Superiour by Land, and can have none by Sea: That in mighty fleets have

the <hi>Belgick</hi> soil, among the continuall tempests and storms of Warre (such as

great plentie of all things, as if the place were as violently bent to maintain a
War, as the People; so that directly you would think, <hi>Mars</hi> onely travels
other Countreys, and carryes about a running Warre, but here seats himself.
Some indeed have fancied, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> out of Policy to spin out the

afterwards to dispatch them (as the Turk doth his <hi>Ianizaries</hi>) into

with dayly slaughter was ever more bloud drawn and spent on both sides.

souldiers, swelling with the ruines of great souls. How many forreign armies
have miscarried here? how often was the <hi>Belgick</hi> Sea covered with ships, the
Land with horse and foot? and, all these armies lost, greater forces have been

Provinces, and Islands, aswell in our World, as beyond the Line. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
not long after, he sent the Crown and Scepter of the Empire (all he had
then left) to his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> (created many years before King of the

to be in the Low-Countreys still. However,<note place="margin">Septemb.</note> I presume the Reader will
approve the bringing to light of this great retirement, and secret of State,
wherein I shall insert many things (that would have been ill lost) into the
Low-Countrey Annals, taking off somewhat from the following sad dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
by the present commemoration of this softer storie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> was scarce landed,<note place="margin">He arrives in <hi>Spain,</hi> the storm sparing him, but not his ship.</note> when a tempest rising in the Harbour,
scattered his whole fleet, and swallowed up the Admiral herself that carried
him: as if she bad farwell to <hi>Cesar</hi> and his fortunes. It is reported, that when
he came ashore, falling upon his knees,<note place="margin">His words when he landed.</note> he kiss'd the earth, and said, he did his
duty to the Common Parent, and that as he came naked out of his mothers
wombe,<note place="margin">His admired constancy put to the Test by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Lords.</note> so he willingly returned to this mother naked. But when he came
into <hi>Biscany,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Burgos,</hi> being met upon the way by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nobility (not to be attracted by <hi>Charles</hi> alone, unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with his Titles) then he first found his nakedness.<note place="margin">But especially by his son.</note> Whereto was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that his Pension of a hundred thousand Duckets (reserved out of his
vast revenues, for part whereof he had present use, to reward his servants, and
dismiss them) was not paid him, but he forced to wait for it at <hi>Burgos,</hi> not
without some indignation,<note place="margin">Which alittle moved him.</note> till at last the mighty summe was tendered. Which
affront as he could hardly dissemble,<note place="margin">Whereupon some thought he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</note> so it gave many men colour to report,
that the Act was scarce passed, when <hi>Charles</hi> repented him of the resignation
of his Kingdoms. Though others say, he changed his mind upon the very
day of his resignment; because many years after, when Cardinal <hi>Granvell</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41239:9"/>
King <hi>Philip</hi> of the anniversary day of his Fathers resignation; the
King presently replied, And this is likewise the anniversary day of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for resigning. Which spread by uncertain rumour, went for currant
news, perswading the world the Emperour was not constant, so much as for
a day, to his unexampled resolution: Unless perhaps King <hi>Philip</hi> thought
not that commendable in his Father, which he himself meant not to imitate.
For my part,<note place="margin">But those Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.</note> in all my search into the books and diaries of his retirement in
the two years time of his private life, I find no mark of this kind of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
nor would it have shewed handsome, if the lively image of such magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,
should be presented to succeeding ages, dressed up in the rags of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
But now, carried in his close chair to <hi>Validolid,</hi> he staid there a while
with his Grand-child, <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose nature did not please
him very well.<note place="margin">The Monastery of S. <hi>Justus.</hi>
                  </note> Thence he retired to S. <hi>Iustus,</hi> a Monastery of <hi>Hieronomites,</hi>
the seat he had long since chosen. It stands upon the confines of <hi>Portugal</hi>
and <hi>Castile,</hi> not far from the Citie of <hi>Placentia,</hi> in a healthfull air, made so by
the sweetness of the Vale, and circling Hils; but especially by the temperate
Winters.<note place="margin">Sex. Aur. Vict. in <hi>Caius Czs.</hi>
                  </note> Into this place (it is reported) <hi>Sertorius</hi> that most valiant General
retreated, when he fled the <hi>Romane</hi> Army, and that here he was treacherous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
slain. Here, at the last, the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> set bounds to his sea of
cares, and erecting his true <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars, built himself a house joyning to
the Monastery; the model whereof was upon his command, sent him a year
before into the Low-Countreys,<note place="margin">The Emperours new habitation.</note> and approved of. It contained but six, at
most seven Cells (for it pleases, as one saith, to know every thing that Princes
do) of twenty foot in breadth and length, right Convent lodgings; from
whence was a prospect, and stairs landing in a little garden, watered with a
spring, planted with Citron and Lemon trees, that shot up their flowers and
fruits to the very vvindows. And this vvas the <hi>Mausoleum,</hi> vvherein that
mighty Emperour, not contented vvith one World, enclosed and buried
himself alive; and to this narrovv compass was that Gyant lessened, that
boasted to stretch his hand further then <hi>Hercules.</hi> So easily vvill Nature shrink
into her ovvn stature and condition, if pride that puffs up and distracts her,
do but once evaporate.</p>
               <p>Coming to this Monastery,<note place="margin">Febr. 1557.</note> of threescore servants, chosen out of his vast
Retinue, he sent the greatest part to <hi>Serandilla,</hi> the next Tovvn, intending to
use them, if there should be occasion;<note place="margin">His family, and how accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated.</note> keeping onely twelve men about him,
and one horse.<note place="margin">His contempt of the world.</note> Nor was his furniture better then his attendance, but all
measured by the strict rule of necessity. And truly it was a miracle to see
<hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour enamoured with solitude, to forget his cares, to be
constant to his resolution, and so much estranged from his old customes and
almost nature; that neither gold, which then in abundance the <hi>Spanish</hi> fleet
brought him from the <hi>Indies;</hi> nor the noise of War, which had wont to be
carried through <hi>Europe</hi> by his Armies and Generals, by Sea and Land; could
any way unfix his mind, for so many years past used to the sound of War;<note place="margin">How be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his time. His riding to take the air.</note> or
disturb his quiet,<note place="margin">His gardening.</note> though upon the hearing of various events.<note place="margin">His making of clocks or wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This Imperial Hermit so spent his time, that he daily bestowed part of it
upon his sick and languishing body, part upon God and his Soul. For some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he rode up and down the grounds, with one footman; sometimes he
quartered his garden into little beds, set flowers, and planted trees with his
triumphant hands,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jannell. Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus,</hi> whose Mathematicall inventions be much delighted in.</note> as once <hi>Dioclesian</hi> did at <hi>Salon,</hi> when he likewise had resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned
his Empire. He often practised to make Watches (whose wheels he
governed with more case, then Fortunes wheel) learning the art of <hi>Iannel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Turrianus,</hi> the <hi>Archimedes</hi> of his time: making many experiments of his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41239:9"/>
Water-works. Nay, 'tis said, the <hi>Aquaduct</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which <hi>Iannellus</hi> had
then modelled, was much advantaged by the Emperours ingenious phansie.
And such a form as they together had conceived in that two years retirement,
such was <hi>Turrianus</hi> his water-work, which after the Emperours decease, by a
new miracle of Art, drew up the river <hi>Tagus</hi> to the top of the mountain of
<hi>Toledo.</hi> This was the man that, in the Emperours solitary life, daily recreated
his spirits, (much taken with such novelties) by shewing unheard of Engines
and Inventions: For often, when the Cloth was taken away after dinner, he
brought upon the board little armed figures of Horse and Foot, some beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Drums, others sounding Trumpets, and divers of them charging one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
with their Pikes.. Sometimes he sent wooden sparrows out of his
chamber into the Emperours Dining-room, that would flie round, and back
again; the Superiour of the Monastery, who came in by accident, suspecting
him for a Conjurer. He likewise framed a Mill of iron that turned it self, of
such a subtile work and smalness, that a Monk could easily hide it in his sleeve,
yet daily it ground as much wheat, as would abundantly serve eight persons
for their dayes allowance. But these sports were more frequent at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
first coming. Afterward, warned by his disease, that still rung the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
of death,<note place="margin">His extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary care of his soul.</note> he more sparingly gave them admittance, onely at such houres
as his pain left him: for now he made it his first care, often to come to Church
at times appointed for the Monks to sing Prayers:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joseph Seguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Order, l. 1.</note> He often read Saints lives,
and discoursed of holy things more frequently, then he accustomed: he wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out the stains of his Conscience, by Confession of his sinns, and are the
bread of Angels, though sometimes not fasting, for which he had a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(by reason of the weakness of his stomack) granted by the Pope.<note place="margin">By the Bull of <hi>Julius</hi> 111. 1554. Marc. 19</note> Nay,
with a discipline of platted cords (so much prevailed the example of others,
and a mind once conquerour over it self) he put himself to constant sharp
penance for his former life.<note place="margin">He disciplined himself.</note> Which Discipline King <hi>Philip</hi> ever had in great
veneration,<note place="margin">His whip reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced by his son.</note> and a little before his death commanded it to be brought to him,
and as it was stained in the bloud of <hi>Charles</hi> his father, he sent it to his sonn
<hi>Philip</hi> the third: and they say, it is still preserved among the pious monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> Lastly, upon occasion of those funerall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequies,
which he celebrated for his Mother, on the Anniversary of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease,
a new desire set him a longing (if it were lawfull) to celebrate his own
funeralls: advising hereupon with <hi>Iohn Regula,</hi> a Father of the Convent, and
his Confessour: when he told him, it was (though without president, yet)
a pious and meritorious act; he commanded immediately, that all funerall
preparations should be made. A Herse was therefore set up in the Church,<note place="margin">Aug. 30. 1558.</note>
torches lighted, and his servants in black stood about it, the Service for the
dead being mournfully sung by the Religious men. He himself surviving his
own funeralls, beheld in that imaginary last office, the true tears of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
He heard the Hymn, wishing him happy rest among the Saints; and
he himself singing with them, prayed for his own soul: till coming near him
that officiated, and delivering him the torch he held lighted in his hand, with
eyes lifted up to heaven, he said, <hi>Thou great Iudge of life and death, I humbly
beseech thee, as the Priest takes from me this wax-light I offer; so thou at last in
thine own good time, wilt graciously please to receive my Spirit, which I commend
into thy hands, arms, and bosome.</hi> Then, as he was, in a loose mourning gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he lay down upon the floor, all the Church beginning to weep a fresh,
and as he had been laid forth to take their last farwell.<note place="margin">Immediately he falls sick.</note> It seems, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
by these feigned Rites, plaid with approaching death: for two dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his personated Obsequies, he fell into a fever, which by little and little
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41239:10"/>
consuming him,<note place="margin">Barthol. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa.</note> the Archbishop of <hi>Toledo</hi> gave him all the supplies by the
Christian Church appointed for the struggling soul, and the Monks that
came frequently out of their Cels into his Bed-chamber,<note place="margin">Soon after he died.</note> prayed God to send
their Guest a happy convoy to the mansion of the Blessed; and on the Eve of
the Evangelist S. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sept. 21. 1558.</note> in the eight and fiftieth year of his age (whereof
he onely lived two years, with a great sence of Piety and Religion) he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this life.<note place="margin">His funerals ushered with Prodigies in heaven.</note> His death was attended with conspicuous signes in Heaven and
Earth: For a while after he sickned, there was seen a blazing star in <hi>Spain,</hi> at
first somewhat dimm, but as his disease increased, so it grew in brightness,<note place="margin">Observed by <hi>Ian. Turrionus</hi> present at the Emperours death.</note>
and at last shooting its fiery hair point blank against the Monastery of S. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi>
in the very hour the Emperour died, the Comet vanished. Nor hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
this without admiration; in the Emperours garden sprung a Lilly,
which at the same time put forth two buds:<note place="margin">And in earth.</note> The one, as it is usuall, blowing
in the Moneth of <hi>May:</hi> The other (though as well watered) gave no signe
of laying its great belly all the Spring and Summer: but that night wherein
the Emperours soul put off the garment of his body, the Lilly suddenly
breaking her Challice, with an unseasonable and unexspected Spring, began
to blow. It was likewise observed by all, that this Lilly laid upon the high
Altar for men to view, was received as a happy and white omen.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, when he had enjoyed his Fathers kingdomes fourty
years,<note place="margin">How long he reigned.</note> the Empire six and thirty, and himself two, after the resignment of
all these, left it doubtful, whether he merited more honour in so long govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Empire, and many Kingdoms, or in relinquishing them all together.
Yet, I am not ignorant, this Act was then diversly censured; and at this day,
the Emperours resignment is an argument for Rhetoricians to declaim upon
in the Schools,<note place="margin">Diverse reasons commonly given for his resigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and Politicians at Court. But omitting the conceptions of
these men, and such builders of Castles in the air, I will give you the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and most probable opinions.</p>
               <p>Many had one reason before their eyes, to wit, his infirmity of the gout,
which from his fiftieth yeare gave him no intervals, but continually torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and forced him (as he professed at his solemn resignation) by a safe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
both for his own and his kingdomes good,<note place="margin">His fear of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes mutability</note> to transfer the weight of
that Government, which he knew himself no longer able to sustain, upon a
man in the full strength of youth and courage. The subtiler people, that
dive into the secrets of business, and sleight all that is visible, suspected that
the Emperour,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peter Mexius</hi> in the life of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>V. Thuanus,</hi> l. 26.</note> terrified with the fortune of <hi>Henry</hi> the second of <hi>France;</hi> held
it safer to encounter him with the youth of his sonne, ambitious and capable
of government, then with his own declining years and victories. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
observed, that from the time he tried in vain to recover the Town of
<hi>Metz,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1552.</note> from the <hi>French,</hi> and sate down before it with an army of one hundred
thousand men, whereof he lost no fewer then fourty thousand; he contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such inward grief: especially having been forced a while before, by <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>
Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> to save himself by an unhandsome, at least unaccustomed
retreat: That for some dayes he kept his chamber, and ever after his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
grew sharper.<note place="margin">Hipp. Chizzal. <hi>in his book inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,</hi> The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Princes.</note> Nay, it was commonly believed, that <hi>Cesars</hi> fortune
glutted and grown coy, began to retire, and that the happy genius of this so
long unconquered Emperour was fled to <hi>Henry</hi> the French King: <hi>Cesar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
not able to dissemble it, being heard to say: <hi>It seems, Fortune is the young
mans mistress.</hi> And therefore for his <hi>Device</hi> of Hercules pillars and the mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<hi>More beyond;</hi> there was painted a Crab-fish, the word, <hi>More on this side,</hi> a
jeer agreeable with the times. Some said, The Emperour did like a wary
Gamster at Dice, who having drawn a great summe of monie in many houres
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41239:10"/>
play, held his hand betimes: and suffered not himself to be stript of all his
victorious heap at one throw. Contrary to this was the sense of others, That
imputed <hi>Cesars</hi> act to his immense ambition.<note place="margin">His immoderate desire of glory.</note> For being of a spirit, as cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

to give in his accounts:<note place="margin">His necessity to make his peace with God.</note> for the Emperours spirit, not altogether deaf to Piety,

happens, it pleased neither side. Lastly, at the storming and sack of <hi>Rome,</hi> he
consented to the <hi>Popes</hi> imprisonment, and would have had him carried into

<hi>Pope,</hi> as if he had been a profane enemy, to purchase his liberty with a huge

ransome. No doubt but such wicked deeds, as they were prejudged by a
common execration, so <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth acknowledged and condemned them
in himself, and their sting, left in his soul, caused that Prince (otherwise reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious)
to do this last act for pacifying the offended <hi>Deity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To do pennance for these crimes be left the world.</note> Yet some there are
that excuse the <hi>Emperour</hi> in point of crime, and lay much of the fault upon
the Age, the Warre and an armed multitude, whose fury, once awaked, is not
ever to be governed by one mans hand. This I find, was most of the discourse
of these times touching the Refignment of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth: and at this day it
is credited or slighted with like faction and ignorance of truth.<note place="margin">It is probable there was a concurrence of many causes. But no rash ones or unworthy the greatnesse of his Imperiall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</note> For my own
part though I know great designs are driven on by many causes, as great ships,
by many oars; yet I cannot perswade my self, the fear of mutable fortune, or
any lighter cause, contributed to <hi>Cesars</hi> determination. Forasmuch as almost
ten years before his death, about the very harvest time of his Victories, in his
last Will and Testament made at <hi>Auspurgh,</hi> he mentioned the Resigning of
his Kingdomes,<note place="margin">1541.</note> and long before that time, I am well assured the Emperour
was minded to divest himself of all the cares and baggage of the world,<note place="margin">1542.</note> the
better to make his speedy retreat to heaven. This was onely imparted to <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Borgia</hi> Duke of <hi>Gandia,</hi> who afterward entered into the Society of <hi>Iesus,</hi>
with a severe injunction, that he should not reveal that intention to any living,
which the <hi>Emperour</hi> resolved to execute, assoon as the Warre gave him any
time to breathe.<note place="margin">1553. Iune.</note> Nor when he had surrendered the Empire were things in
such a condition,<note place="margin">Iuly 1553.</note> to make him repent his fortune: for a while after, the siege
of <hi>Metz</hi> was raised, <hi>Terwin</hi> a strong Fort in the Low-countreys, and <hi>Hedin</hi>
where antiently the Princes of <hi>Artois</hi> kept their Courts, were taken, and upon
both places many of the <hi>French</hi> Gentry slain. Nay in <hi>Italy,</hi> part of the Isle of
<hi>Corsica</hi> was in despight of the enemy preserved for the <hi>Genoueses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1554.</note> and (which
was yet happier) the Citie <hi>Siena</hi> was taked,<note place="margin">1555.</note> the <hi>French</hi> beat out of it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
out of all the Dutchy of <hi>Florence.</hi> But I believe what he had often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
was then resolved,<note place="margin">The fear of death was the chief motive of putting his Resolve in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> when his disease came to that heigh, that he often
fainted away: especially, when he heard of his mothers death, he began to
make sure account his own fate drew nigh: so that he was many times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
he heard his mothers voice, calling her sonne to her. Which opinion
took the deeper impression,<note place="margin">1555.</note> because <hi>Vesalius</hi> physitian to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> stuck
not to tell him (with strange freedome in a man of his profession) that his life
could not continue.<note place="margin">Andreas Vc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salius.</note> So as the <hi>Emperour</hi> made haste to do, what he had so
often determined, lest death that followed close, should prevent him. And at
that time was often heard to repeat the words of one of his Commanders
(whose worth I better know, then his name) that being an old Officer of
Horse,<note place="margin">He was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a noble saying of one of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.</note> and resolving to leave the world, when he petitioned the <hi>Emperour</hi> for a
discharge from service, who urged him to give a reason for his new resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they say his answer was, <hi>That between the business of life, and day of death, a
space ought to be interposed.</hi> Which ingenious sentence printed it self in the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi>
heart, that had been long upon the like meditation. But then, when
the end of his life was visible, he held it his best course to lay hold upon that
space, beyond which there is nothing. Wherein, neglecting the affairs of
others, he might onely regard his own concernment: rescue himself, from
external cares, representing and confining himself onely to himself, before
the hand of necessity should arrest and carry him to Gods Tribunall, guilty,
in so high a degree, of mortall happiness. To that purpose he retired into this
sanctuary,<note place="margin">It is concluded the <hi>Emperours</hi> resolution came from heaven.</note> where solitude gave him leasure: and the sanctity of the place, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement

had undertaken, in that two years time, wherein he extended his victory
over himself; or his holy end, which did not surprise him, but came when
he was prepared (which is the hardest task) for death in life: He, I say, must
needs acknowledge it to be no trifling cause, or unworthy of so great a soul;

Cities, above three hundred and fiftie: great Villages (to omit the lesser)
above six thousand three hundred: besides Forts, that stand so thick, as if
the ground were sown with them: Yet the ingeniousness of the People, and
their contrivance is such, as their variety and plenty of manufactures are
more then can be used, in the narrow bounds of this one Nation. The
world hath not a more industrious,<note place="margin">Militia.</note> richer, or constanter <hi>Militia;</hi> so as <hi>Mars</hi>

Land contracts their limits, so much by Sea have they opened to themselves
larger Countreys, which they have subdued and peopled, extending as it

Nay, the <hi>West-Indians,</hi> trucking for their Linen and Woollen, have
learned the names of the Low-Countrey cities. To conclude, we seldome
at this day admire the workmanship of any Engines, which the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
men have not either invented, or brought unto perfection. Heretofore
their wits were indeed kept under and depressed, when their fortune was as
low as their Countrey: Now there is an other age, and other manners.

the well-ordering of the Common-wealth by themselves created,
their stupendious Fire and Water-works (proofs of no dejected natures)
are scarce any where to be matched; I am sure so many together are not to
be seen in all the rest of <hi>Europe,</hi> as in this little plot of the Low-Countreys.
It is likewise proper to this Nation (if left to themselves) to hate fraud,<note place="margin">The Character of a Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey man.</note> and
by that credit which they know they themselves deserve, to measure others.
They are not greatly taken with presents, at least not long, using benefits like
flowers, that please while they are fresh: their sense of injuries is the same;
which they presently forget, and easily pass over, unless they conceive
themselves sleighted, then their fury is implacable. They have likewise a
shrewd guess of their own strength, seldome undertaking any thing they do

by Sea or Land, inhabiting both the Elements, and not obliged by the
Laws of either. In this they exceed, that how great soever their gains or
losses are (a Common case with Merchants) they passe it over with so little
and dull a sense of joy or grief, as you would think them <hi>factours</hi> for others,
&amp; not <hi>owners</hi> of the goods, I suppose out of the native temper of their minds,
and the air of their Countrey that quickens them with colder spirits. But
in maintaining their liberty, they are very fierce, for they hold it an honour
to undervalue all things in respect of that: wherein they sometimes come
nearer to licentiousness,<note place="margin">Belgium di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 17 Provinces.</note> then liberty. The whole Region of <hi>Belgica</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,

freed from the jurisdiction of the <hi>French</hi> King, who formerly was their Lord

which had been attempted by his great Grand-father) gave off the designe,<note place="margin">Why he did not.</note>
because they were so different in manners, language, customes, and emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
incident to neighbours, that he thought it hardly possible to reduce them
to one kind of government, whereof a Kingdome must consist, none of
the Provinces consenting to yield precedence to any of the rest, or to submit
to the Laws of others as their superiours.<note place="margin">The distribution of the Provinces</note> From hence was derived the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome

wherein he sayes, <hi>He is induced, at that time especially, to increase the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Bishops, because the Cities and Towns of the</hi> Netherlands <hi>daily grew more
populous, and</hi> Heresie <hi>from their</hi> next Neighbours <hi>crowded in, and got ground of
them: and that his Fathers Counsel and Command, had made deep impression in
his mind, who taught him this, as the onely way to preserve Religion in the Low-Countreys.</hi>
The King therefore, assoon as he was respited by the War,<note place="margin">His son <hi>Philip</hi> attempts it.</note> sent
to <hi>Rome Francis Sonnius,</hi> a Divine of <hi>Lovain,</hi> a great learned man, (who not
long before had disputed at <hi>Wormes</hi> with <hi>Melanchthon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Treats about it with the Pope.</note> 
                  <hi>Illyricus,</hi> and others
(by command from the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi>) giving him in Commission,
together with <hi>Francisco Varga,</hi> the Kings Ambassadour, to acquaint <hi>Paul</hi> the
fourth with his desires.<note place="margin">Concludes with him.</note> After some moneths, when the business had been
debated by a Court of seven Cardinals, it was accordingly granted: The
<hi>Pope</hi> inclining of himself to destroy heresie, and neglecting no occasion of
gratifying King <hi>Philip,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fourteen Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks were to be added to the four former.</note> to whom he was lately reconciled. So that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
fourteen Cities in the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> (besides the foure former) for
Bishops-sees, whereof three were honoured with the Prerogative of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishopricks,<note place="margin">Whereof three Archbishopricks.</note>
that is, <hi>Cambray, Utrecht</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and <hi>Maclin</hi> preferred
before the others at the Kings request: which seated in the heart of <hi>Brabant,</hi>
near the Princes Court at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> he had designed for <hi>Anthony Perenott
Granvell,</hi> purposely translated from the Church of <hi>Arras</hi> thither, because
that mans being near the Court, seemed to concern the publick. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the <hi>Popes</hi> Bul was penned, and sent by his <hi>Nuntio, Salvator</hi> Bishop of <hi>Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sino,</hi>
and <hi>Francis Sonnius</hi> going for the Low-Countreys, who was enjoyned
to see the Decree executed; but in other things belonging to the revenues and
limits of Jurisdiction, they were to do what to themselves in their discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
seemed meet.<note place="margin">The men chosen for those Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses.</note> King <hi>Philip</hi> having received authority, made an excellent
choice of men for the new Myters; all famour for the learned books they
had written, as likewise for their virtues and deportments in the Councel of
<hi>Trent.</hi> Such Bishops the <hi>Pope</hi> joyed to approve of, and the people were
ashamed not to admit. And because the King would no longer defer his
voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> he left the care of limiting and endowing the new
Churches to <hi>Granvell</hi> and <hi>Sonnius:</hi> for the Popes <hi>Nuntio</hi> was to follow
his Majestie.</p>
               <p>Before his departure, the King summoned the Estates of the <hi>Low-countreys</hi>
to <hi>Gant:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Low-countreys.</note> many were of opinion, he would there declare a Governour for
the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> which he had till then declined: though others imputed
the cause of that delay to the Kings nature, perplexed and doubtfull whom
to trust with the Government. Which procrastination daily added to the
number of Competitours,<note place="margin">Various conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures (as is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) who should be the man.</note> and to the discourses of lookers on. Many of
which, according to their severall dependencies, made sure accompt their
friends and Patrons should carry it: and together with this belief cherished
their own hopes. Divers that aimed at no private advantage, did not so
much named a <hi>Person,</hi> as a <hi>Governour:</hi> being ambitious to be Statesmen,<note place="margin">The major part conceive, Count <hi>Egmont</hi> will be elected, a man of much same and merit.</note>
though it were but in giving imaginary votes: as if they should have their
part in the Government, if they could but think of disposing the Provinces,
and fill a vancant place, by predesigning him that should be chosen. But
Count <hi>Egmont</hi> was the man, on whom the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> fixt their eyes and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41239:16"/>
wishes, a Prince conspicuous for his experience in the Warrs, and very
active either in the field against the Enemies, or at home in private Tiltings:
and for shooting in a piece at marks (an art of great account with that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
second to none. Besides, he had a naturall affability, and (which is
rare) a Popularity consistent with Nobility. But he was particularly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for the late victory at S. <hi>Quintins,</hi> a great part whereof the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
himself engaged for, to Count <hi>Egmont:</hi> and for a later day at
<hi>Gravelin;</hi> since when the Low-Countrey-men had not wiped the enemies
bloud off their swords. In which expedition asmuch as he transcended the
other Lords that had command in the Army, especially the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> so
much (with all forreiners but them) he gained glory to his Nation; and to
himself the favour of others, by his own to them. So that if a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for the Low-Countreys might have been voted by the souldiers love,
and the peoples consent, no man should have been preferred before Count
<hi>Egmont.</hi> But on a deeper sea, and with a more popular wind sailed the
Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Many think the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it, a man of greater power and wealth.</note> The greatness of the House of <hi>Nassau,</hi> equall fortunes;
the principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> subject to none: besides his other large possessions
both in <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Low-countreys;</hi> and his powerfull alliance to most of
the great families of the North, his mother <hi>Iuliana</hi> being a woman of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
fecundity: for of her children, whereof the greatest part were
daughters, she lived to see one hundred and fifty that asked her blessing.
Add to this his own merit: his dexterity of wit,<note place="margin">Not undeserving</note> and staiedness of judgement,
far riper then his years: and his abilities both as an Ambassadour and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
Then the great opinion the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth had of him,
who employed him in his weightiest affairs. Upon these and such like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
how could the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> go less in his hopes, then to be
Governour of the <hi>Low-countreys;</hi> a place which his cousen <hi>Engelbert</hi> Count of
<hi>Nassau</hi> enjoyed about an hundred years before:<note place="margin">But he doubts a repulse.</note> Yet doubting the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
he had divided his suit: that if he himself should meet a repulse,
yet <hi>Christiern</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Lorain</hi> might prevail, whose daughter he hoped
to marry,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Christierna</hi> of <hi>Lorain</hi> is also designed for the place.</note> intending (for that was his drift) that his mother in law should
have the <hi>Title,</hi> but he himself the <hi>Power.</hi> And indeed the Dutchess of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
was every way capable of the place,<note place="margin">With generall approbation.</note> as being daughter to <hi>Isabella,</hi> sister
to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and having merited the favour of her cousen-german the
King, by the Peace which she lately had concluded with the <hi>French,</hi> upon
conditions more advantagious to the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> for which she was much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by the Low-countrey-men. But whilest on such kind of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
mens hopes and discourses were protracted and suspended;<note place="margin">But <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi> is preferred before them all.</note> behold
upon the sudden came news, That <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Parma,</hi>
was sent for out of <hi>Italy</hi> to govern the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi> Which though it
happened unexspectedly, yet could be no wonder to such as rightly judged.
For on the one part, it was in reason to be thought, the King at that time
would not easily trust the government of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> in the hand of a
Low-countrey-man. Such as looked into it, might see cause sufficient.
Particularly, Count <hi>Egmont</hi> had a bar, by the unhappy memory of <hi>Charles
Egmont</hi> Duke of <hi>Gelder;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What hindred Count <hi>Egmont.</hi>
                  </note> who being of the <hi>French</hi> faction, and a professed
enemie to the House of <hi>Austria, Charles</hi> the fifth confiscated his Estate, and
forced his heir to render <hi>Gelderland</hi> and <hi>Zutfen.</hi> And divers reports going
of the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> Religion (in which kind a suspicion onely was
enough to quash his sute) the King would be sure never to commit the <hi>Low-countreys</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  </note>

                  </hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
both as a neighbour and a kinsman, which might open them a pass into
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41239:17"/>
the seventeen Provinces.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>What</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern <hi>of</hi> Lorain.</note> Nay, even to the Dutchess of <hi>Lorain</hi> the rumour
of a Treaty of marriage betwixt her Daughter and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
was very disadvantagious, in her pretension to the government: though it
made more against her, that she had married her sonne <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
to the daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi> For they say, Bishop <hi>Granvel</hi>
advised the King to look to it, lest if she were Governess, the <hi>French</hi> coming
in mixt with the <hi>Lorainers,</hi> might pester the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi> Perhaps he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
being a <hi>Burgundian,</hi> gave his Majestie this counsel, for fear the <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
should be subject to the <hi>Lorainers,</hi> their ancient enemies. Or rather,
finding the King inclined to the Dutchess of <hi>Parma;</hi> he endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
his zeal in preferring her, and so to predeserve her favour. But to
choose her, there was a concurrence of many reasons. Before I Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize
them, let me speak a little of the Dutchess her self, and give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of her birth and education; together with her deportment before she
came to govern the <hi>Low-countreys:</hi> Since the best Historians use, not onely
to describe the <hi>Actions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cic. l. 2. de O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratore.</note> but likewise the <hi>Fame</hi> of Persons: and are tied by the
rules of History, not to omit the Characters of their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret</hi> eldest child to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth; born four years before he was
married,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of</hi> Margaret <hi>of</hi> Parma.</note> had a mother of the same name, <hi>Margaret Vangest</hi> (as long after
it came to light) daughter to <hi>Iohn Vangest</hi> and <hi>Mary Cocquamb</hi> of <hi>Aldenard,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her Mother. Her mothers Parents.</note>
persons of good quality in <hi>Flanders:</hi> Both which dying of the sickness,
left <hi>Margaret</hi> then but five years old,<note place="margin">Education.</note> to her fathers dear friend, <hi>Anthony La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
Count <hi>Hochstrat:</hi> who with his wife, <hi>Elizabeth Culemberg,</hi> bred her as
their onely child. When she was grown a woman, not onely as a great
Beauty, but as one that consecrated her beauty with modestie, she was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to by many noble Suiters.<note place="margin">Perfections.</note> But she dashed all their hopes with the
rub of chastity, intending within a few dayes to be a Nun. In the mean
time, being invited to a Wedding, and dancing there among other young
Ladies of her qualitie; she found by too late experience, that such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their beautie, set to sale their chastity, especially if a great Chapman
be at hand.<note place="margin">The Emperour falls in love with her.</note> For the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, in his passage by <hi>Aldenard,</hi>
honouring this wedding with his presence, <hi>Margaret</hi> that came along with
the Countess of <hi>Hochstrat,</hi> surpassing all the other Ladies in his eye, was
highly commended by his Imperial Majestie, who while he commended,
seemed to long for her: Insomuch as one of his followers (of that ging of
Courtiers, that have no way to merit their Princes favour, but by slavish
arts) catched her up in the dark, and brought her to the Bed-chamber.
By her the Emperour had this <hi>Margaret</hi> we write of. The Business was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years concealed by <hi>Cesars</hi> command, especially because the same Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
accidently had told him, that he took a great deal of pains to perswade
the Virgin, but could not get her for his Imperial Majesty, without force
and threatning: At which the Emperour was so moved, that giving the
man a sound check for it, he vowed, if he had known as much before, he
would never have touched the maid; and therefore commanded her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
should be kept private;<note place="margin">Delivered of <hi>Margaret</hi> Anno 1522. whom Cesar conceals for her mothers credit and his own. But at last it was discovered.</note> as well to preserve the Mothers honour, as his
own. For the Emperour was not prodigall of his fame in this kind, nor with
pomp and ceremony brought his by-blows on the stage. But the secret
lay not long in the Embers, being gossiped out by a woman, employed as a
necessary instrument in such cases: She imparted it to her husband, he,
with the same secresie told it to a friend of his (for every one hath some he
trusts, as much as others can trust him) just like the rain on the house top,
which falling from one tile to another, and so from gutter to gutter, at last
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41239:17"/>
is spouted into the high way. For when many are of counsel in a business,
what was every ones secret, becomes a rumour to the people. Nor did the
Mother think it amiss, after she was known to have a child, that the father of
it should be likewise known, as if her fault should be lessened by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his name. And shortly the child appeared to be of the House of
<hi>Austria,</hi> by her Princely education.</p>
               <p>The Low-Countreys were then governed for <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth by his
Aunt <hi>Margaret,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Infant is sent to be edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the Emperours Aunt.</note> Daughter to the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the first and <hi>Mary</hi>
Dutchess of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> The <hi>Emperour</hi> bred the Infant in the Court of his
Aunt, under whom he himself in his infancy had been educated. Till she
was eight years old, the child was fostered in the bosome of that Princess.
After whose decease, she was sent to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> sister to
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth,<note place="margin">And afterwards by his sister.</note> who being left a widow by King <hi>Lewis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1530.</note> had the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given to her. And her neece <hi>Margaret</hi> grew so like her, not onely in
her private and publick virtues:<note place="margin">Her disposition.</note> but by observant imitation, the child had
the happiness to get her very sense and propensions, her gravity and meen.
The <hi>Governess</hi> was much delighted in the sport of Hunting,<note place="margin">Her delight in hunting.</note> whereupon they
commonly called her the Forestress: as the true Neece to <hi>Mary</hi> Dutchess
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that constantly followed the Chase, till by a fall from her horse
she got her death. This Fate appears not onely to be her own, but to relate
to <hi>Maximilian:</hi> whose other wife <hi>Blanca Sforza,</hi> while she was hunting, was
likewise thrown from her horse and killed.<note place="margin">1496.</note> The Dutchess of <hi>Parma</hi> was
so taken with this sport, and had so hardened her body with exercise, that
she fearless galloped after her Aunt over the lawns and through the woods,
before she was ten years of age. As she grew in years, she grew to exceed
her Mistress in horsemanship, she was then betroathed the second time, to
<hi>Alexander Medices</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cesar</hi> promises her in marriage to the Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi>
                  </note> she and her first husband <hi>Hercules</hi> Prince of
<hi>Ferrara</hi> having never bedded. For the <hi>Emperour,</hi> that he might win <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so</hi>
father to <hi>Hercules</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> from whom he was offered great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
by <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the seventh:<note place="margin">Breaking the match intended with the Prince of Ferrara.</note> Courted him upon the self same terms,
confirming him in the Principality of <hi>Mutina</hi> and <hi>Regio,</hi> and espousing his
Daughter <hi>Margaret,</hi> then hardly four years old, to <hi>Alphonso</hi>'s eldest sonne,
<hi>Hercules.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1516.</note> By these espousals the Emperour gained <hi>Alphonso,</hi> as the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his affairs required. But a while after, he being drawn again to side
with the <hi>French:</hi> and his Sonne <hi>Hercules</hi> married to <hi>Renata</hi> Daughter to
<hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Pope,</hi> upon his reconcilement with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,<note place="margin">1529.</note>
among other articles of Peace, agreed that <hi>Alexander Medices</hi> (son
to that <hi>Laurence</hi> whom <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth,<note place="margin">Francisc. Maria Feltrio.</note> deposing <hi>Feltrio,</hi> had created Duke
of <hi>Florence</hi>) should be settled by the Imperiall Army in the Florentine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality:
and that to confirm him therein the Emperour should bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him his Daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> in marriage. Which conditions <hi>Cesar</hi>
willingly signed; partly out of respect to his <hi>Holyness,</hi> whose injury he
seemed to cancell by this benefit: partly in hatred to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> that
entering into the <hi>Lotrechian</hi> association against the Emperour had put their
City under the <hi>French</hi> Kings protection. <hi>Alexander</hi> was forthwith possessed
of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the <hi>Florentines</hi> dispossessed of their liberty. But the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
was not compleated till seven years after, <hi>Pope Clement</hi> being then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased.
Nay the match, by occasion of the <hi>Popes</hi> death, came into a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of breaking, upon the solicitation of some great men in <hi>Florence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> labour to break the match.</note> who
by that seven years protraction imagining the Emperour wavered in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
treated with him, on great hopes and promises, not to admit of
<hi>Alexander</hi> for his son in law, but to restore the City to its freedome, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41239:18"/>
they would onely hold of the Emperour. But <hi>Cesar</hi> having past his promise
to the <hi>Pope</hi> in his life time,<note place="margin">But in vain.</note> thought himself bound in point of honour to
make it good after the <hi>Popes</hi> decease. Especially because he suspected, that
the <hi>Florentines</hi> leaned towards the <hi>French.</hi> Nor was he ignorant, that a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
more easily obliges particulars, then a multitude: and that favours
scattered in publick,<note place="margin">The Nuptials, celebrated at <hi>Naples.</hi>
                  </note> are received by all, returned by none. The Emperour
therefore sending for <hi>Alexander</hi> from <hi>Florence,</hi> to attend him at <hi>Naples:</hi> and
to the Low-Countreys for <hi>Margaret,</hi> who longed to see her Father return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Warre of <hi>Tunis;</hi> at a Convention of the <hi>Estates</hi> and a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

wherein the Emperour himself ran a Tilt, habited like a Tauny-moor. But

looking with discontented eyes upon the present state,<note place="margin">1536.</note> and making the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens

sunnes splendour suddenly eclipsed. Nor did their conjecture fail them,<note place="margin">Her husband slain the same year.</note> for
<hi>Alexander</hi> by the Emperours affinity grown proud, and therefore careless,
fell intemperately to love women, and so impolitickly, that being secure
from forrein force, he was, with the bait that pleased him, easily intrapped
by his kinsman <hi>Lorenzo Medices,</hi> of Counsell with him in his pleasures;
and in hope or under pretence of restoring <hi>Florence</hi> to her liberty, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth

the house of <hi>Medices,</hi> by establishing that family in the Dukedome of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:</hi>
and having likewise laid an obligation upon <hi>Cosmo</hi> himself, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
(though many opposed it) the Principality upon him: sought a son

For as both these Princes studied to make the <hi>Pope,</hi> who being pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
in long hoorded wealth and wisdome, no doubt but his inclining to
either side would turn the scales; so the <hi>Pope,</hi> vigilant for his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
took this opportunity to treat with the Emperour of a marriage for his
Nephew: especially since the news of <hi>Solimans</hi> fleet growing dayly more
terrible, it concerned them both to confirm the Peace made between them
and the state of <hi>Venice,</hi> by an intermarriage in their families. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
was so willing to comply with the <hi>Pope,</hi> That he not onely preferred
his Nephew before the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> (who then by his <hi>Ambassadour</hi>
renued his former suit) and before other Princes, which had the like am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition:
but instantly making up the match between his Daughter and <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi>
he put them together, though the Bride had little joy of the wedding,
despising her husbands unripe years. Therefore jestingly she called it her
Fate, to be <hi>married,</hi> but not <hi>matched;</hi> for when she was a Gyrl of twelve, she
must then have a man of seven and twenty; and now she was a woman, a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41239:18"/>
Boy of thirteen. For some years after this marriage,<note place="margin">With whom at first she cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responded not.</note> she had an aversion
from her husband, not so much in contempt of his years, as by reason of ill
offices done by a Courtier, who having been her old servant bare a great
sway with her; and hating the <hi>Farnezes</hi> with more then his own spleen,
sometimes commending her first husband <hi>Alexander,</hi> sometimes aggravating
the <hi>Popes</hi> injuries to her father, nourished domestick discord: till at length,<note place="margin">1541.</note>
he being removed, and <hi>Octavio</hi> attending the Emperour in his Warres,<note place="margin">But afterwards He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared to her.</note> the
mind of the Dutchess began to change. For when the Emperour was to go
for <hi>Africa</hi> from <hi>Lucca,</hi> whither the <hi>Pope</hi> came to conferre with his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Majesty, and had brought along <hi>Octavio</hi> and <hi>Margaret,</hi> though <hi>Paul</hi>
the third utterly disliked the voyage to <hi>Argeirs,</hi> yet he ventured his Nephew
<hi>Octavio,</hi> commending him to <hi>Cesars</hi> fortune: and designing in that one act
to give Hostage to the Emperour, and bring his daughter into a longing
for her absent husband.<note place="margin">By means of his Absence and Hazzards.</note> And indeed after the misfortune of the Warre,
wherein the Emperour was rather worsted by the <hi>Sea,</hi> then by the <hi>Moors,</hi> the
news of <hi>Cesars</hi> overthrow was divulged in all places. And because no man
could tell what was become of him, and the Reliques of his scattered fleet,
it was constantly believed at <hi>Rome</hi> that the Emperour was cast away: some
reported they saw the ship, wherein <hi>Octavio</hi> was abroad, eaten up by the Sea:
which was the rather believed, because when the Emperours escape was
known, <hi>Octavio</hi> was not mentioned.<note place="margin">1545.</note> This first moved the Dutchess, her
love growing out of pity; as if the youth flying from his wives frowns had
run upon his Fate,<note place="margin">Her love to him increased.</note> in the prime of his years and fortunes. But when the
news came that he was living,<note place="margin">See the ninth Book.</note> and with his Father in law, onely that he lay
desperately sick; hope and fear joyned to bring her love and pitie to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
till two years after (in all which time he still kept the field and was
never out of the Emperours eye) at his return to <hi>Rome;</hi> aswell his long stay
from her, as his long service to her Father speaking in his behalf, it is hardly
credible with what longing and affection his wife received and honoured
him. Not long after she having the rare happiness to be brought a bed of two
sonnes at a birth; by how much it joyed her, (especially they comming at
the same time to the Principality of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia</hi>) by so much her
love to her husband increased. Onely, as she was violently ambitious to
command in chief, and therefore hardly brooked a power divided with her
husband;<note place="margin">Not without some instrve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning jarres.</note> so when discords sprang between them, she would not easily be
reconciled. The truth is her spirit was not onely great beyond her sex:<note place="margin">Her masculine spirit.</note> but
she went so habited, and had such a garb, as if she were not a woman with a
masculine spirit, but a man in womans clothes. Her strength was such,<note place="margin">And manly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises.</note> as
she used to hunt the stagg, and change horses upon the field, which is more
then many able bodied men can do. Nay upon her chin and upper lip she
had a little kind of beard, which gave her not more of the <hi>resemblance</hi> then
<hi>authority</hi> of a man. And, which seldome happens in her sex, and never but to
very strong women, she was troubled with the Gout.<note place="margin">She was of a ready wit.</note> She had a present
wit, and in action could steer to all sides with wonderfull dexterity: as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been of a child bred up in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Court, and instructed in her
youth by the adverse fortune of the <hi>Medices;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wonderfull discreet.</note> in her riper years accomplished
and made absolute by the discipline of <hi>Farnezes</hi> Palace, and the old learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the third. Then for piety, she had a great master indeed,<note place="margin">And religious.</note>
                  <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> Founder of the Society of <hi>Iesus:</hi> to whom she confessed
her sinnes, and that oftner then was the custome of those times.<note place="margin">Especially at the Eucharist.</note> By this
man she was taught a singular <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> towards the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
proper to the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> Whereupon one every year,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41239:19"/>
in Passion week,<note place="margin">Her yearly Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the poor.</note> she washed the feet of twelve poor maids (which she
commanded should not be washed before she came): Then feasting them,
waited herself at table, and sent them away new clothed, and full of gold.
Upon the other more chearfull solemnitie of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> day, she gave
very noble portions to poor Virgins, and married them to good Husbands.
Both these feasts she kept during her life. With this breeding and these
parts,<note place="margin">Which juncture of excellencies principally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King to make her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness of the Low-countreys.</note> the Dutchess so won upon the King her Brother, that he committed
the Low-countreys to her; knowing her to be a woman of great courage,
and excellently versed in the art of Government. Besides, his Fathers
commands were yet fresh in his memory, who loved her dearly, and on his
death-bed earnestly recommended her to the King.<note place="margin">A second Cause thereof.</note> It seems, he thought
this honour would answer the Fathers wishes, and the Daughters merit:
Withall,<note place="margin">A third.</note> he hoped the Low-countreymen for the reverence they bare to the
name of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, would chearfully obey his Daughter, born among
them, and bred up to their fashions; and that her Countrey-men would
therefore the better digest her Government, because subjected people think
themselves partly free, if governed by a Native. Perhaps the King was
content, in favour of the Low-countreymen, to let them be governed by a
Woman, hoping the Innovations he had designed, would please, coming
from a Lady, like an incision, that pains the less when made by a soft hand.
But besides these reasons given out in publick, there was other private cause.
<hi>Octavio Farneze</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> had long since been in the
Low-countreys,<note place="margin">A fourth, more secret, perhaps more true.</note> and there served a Volunteer against the <hi>French;</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
for <hi>Italy,</hi> he was an earnest suiter to King <hi>Philip</hi> (to whom he delivered)
his son <hi>Alexander</hi>) that he would please to restore him the Castle of <hi>Piacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi>
kept as yet with a <hi>Spanish</hi> Garrison. The King, though he resolved not
to grant his suit; yet lest the Prince should return discontented (whom by
long experience he had found faithfull and serviceable to the Crown of
<hi>Spain,</hi> in his command against <hi>Herecules</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Generall, in the War of
<hi>Italy:</hi> and the obedience of whose <hi>Cisalpine</hi> Countreys, would great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Spain</hi>) conferred the Government of the <hi>Low-countreys</hi> and <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
upon his wife, acquainting the Duke with it, as if he did it for his sake;
assuring himself whilest those Provinces which he looked upon with so
much love and care, were in his absence committed to the <hi>Farnezes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> they
would rest well contented with so high an argument of confidence and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Nor did <hi>Octavio</hi> sleight the favour; nay, as it often happens, that
a present bounty is the step to a future rise; he hoped, by the tie of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
every day more to endear his Majestie to his Sister, and to the
House of the <hi>Farnezes.</hi> The King lessened not that hope, which he knew
would serve to make the <hi>Farnezes</hi> intentive to the Government of the Low-countreys:
for by how much the Governess might advance his interest in
the Low-countreys, as well because of her Religion as her Prudence, so
much the gladder he was, to have such Pledges from them. The King
therefore not onely kept his son <hi>Alexander,</hi> to aw the mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he
thought it concerned him to give the father hope of the Castle of <hi>Piacenza;</hi>
well knowing some mens natures are more obliged by receiving one, then
many benefits.</p>
               <p>The Governess being designed, and new come into the Low-countreys,

how to use them.<note place="margin">Instructed by the King.</note> That she was to make it a rule at the Board, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

reasons, Lest upon dispute there should grow contestation, and the authors

that strangers might not know who to <hi>thank</hi> or <hi>complain</hi> of;<note place="margin">The causes of this Command.</note> whence this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
would ensue, That envie which uses to be levelled at particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
would not be conceived, at least not practised against a multitude.
There would be less heart-burning among the Lords of the Councel, and
every one more freely vote according to justice and equity, because less en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to decline it by hope or fear.<note place="margin">How she was to call the Councell.</note> Another reason was, That if the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness</hi>
observed them to be divided into faction, or packed together in a
Conspiracy, she should then, breaking up the Councel, call to her a cabinet
Councel, which the King named, <hi>viz. Granvel</hi> Bishop of <hi>Arras, Charles</hi>
Count <hi>Barlamont,</hi> and <hi>Viglius</hi> President of the Privie-Councel.<note place="margin">Ulricus Viglius Zuichem.</note> This pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
meeting was called the <hi>Consult.</hi> Nay, upon any sudden accident, when
it would take up too much time, and be too dangerous,<note place="margin">Severall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons thereof.</note> to have it heard and
determined at the Councel-table, the Governess was to impart it to this
Cabinet Councel, where it would have a quicker dispatch, and sometimes
more advised: For the less number (the King said) would be less tedious,
and yet a few well chosen give as good advice. And then secrets would not
be brought upon the stage, and there would be little occasion for the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to make speeches, and to maintain their opinions; because without a
<hi>Scene</hi> and admiring <hi>Spectatours,</hi> proud men do but coldly act their parts.
The greatest business are therefore agitated, out of the crowd, with less
pomp, and more advantage. Lastly, in these meetings, where (though all
have equall right to vote, and not equal judgement, yet) the major part car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
it, it is easie to find (because in a multitude) many that want either
ability or honesty: howsoever in regard their <hi>number</hi> is to be considered, not
their <hi>reasons;</hi> the more and not the better must prevail.</p>
               <p>His Majesty having thus instructed the Governess, and assigned her an
Annuall persion of thirty six thousand Crowns;<note place="margin">The King after her instructions, gives her a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> to encrease the publick joy

entrenched upon or invaded,<note place="margin">The Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymens Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges very great.</note> will cause insurrections. Nor is it unknown,
that the government of the Low-Countreys, came very near the form of
free cities, by the indulgence of their Princes: who had made them, by
many and liberall Charters, though not absolutely <hi>free-States,</hi> yet more
then <hi>common subjects:</hi> especially those of <hi>Brabant,</hi>

that their children might enjoy the priviledges of <hi>Brabant.</hi> You would think
the husbandman had chosen this for a nursery for his plants: and after they
were grown up, and had sucked their first moisture from that earth; then
they were removed, carrying along with them the endowments of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitable

that the <hi>Spanish</hi> souldiers contrary to the Kings promise, were kept
so long in the Low-Countreys, that fourteen Bishops added to four which
they had antiently, the episcopall jurisdiction seemed to be encreased with
breach of priviledge to the Provinces, that there was an endeavour to bring
in new Inquisitions of faith, and to impose an universall form of judicature
upon the Low-Countreys, which how they were the beginning of causes of

(as it often happens, especially in the Towns where they are quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered)
that it did not a little exasperate the minds of the inhabitants, so as

a moment: So as they that make this the cause of the <hi>Belgick</hi> troubles,

But whether it was the multiplication of Miters, or the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them; it is not to be imagined how ill it took in the Low-countreys
with all degrees of men. The former Bishops, as well the Low-countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">By the old Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</note>
as their Neighbours, complained, That by setting up new ones, <hi>those</hi>
had their Jurisdictions confined to narrow limits; <hi>these,</hi> that they were not
onely straitened in their limits, but likewise in the revenues of their Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,
especially since this had been determined at <hi>Rome,</hi> without hearing of
the parties therein concerned. The Nobility were aggrieved,<note place="margin">The Lords tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</note> that <hi>Bishops</hi>
should come in place of <hi>Abbots,</hi> because being a degree higher, they would
be far more potent, and therefore it would not onely derogate from the
Lords Temporall, but also from their liberty. Nor should they dare to
speak freely in the great Councel of Estates, when those men were present,
whom they knew, as bound by oath to the <hi>Pope,</hi> would draw all businesses
to <hi>Rome.</hi> Neither was it for the Kings service, that they should bear all the
sway,<note place="margin">The Abbots.</note> who were the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> sworn servants. But no complaints
were bitterer then the <hi>Abbots</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> because none seemed juster. That
they were deprived contrary to all precedent, of the right and power to
choose an <hi>Abbot</hi> out of their own Order; that there ought not to be set
over Religious men, that had a certain Rule and form of life, men ignorant
of Religious Discipline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">And almost all that stood for the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey priviledges.</note> that indeed the <hi>means</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>Abbots</hi>
would pass to the Bishops, but the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> remain with some of the
Monks; that truly at present, such men were advanced to those Offices, as
were eminent for piety and learning, but hereafter those rich <hi>Deodands</hi> should
be exposed for prey, to some of the Princes followers and flatterers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these common objections, two more were in almost all mens mouths,
That by the creation of new Bishops, the privelledges of <hi>Brabant</hi> were infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and by degrees the tyrannie of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition would be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
The latter whereof, because it raised particular troubles, I shall
speak of it apart. But though I read the other almost in all writers, yet
what the words of the Charter should be, whereby the King obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so, as that he could not augment the number of Bishops, I find in no Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41239:23"/>
For what some write, that the King swears at his Coronation, not
to encrease the State Ecclesiasticall, is not an ingenuous allegation, because
the Prince onely swears to that kind of encrease, whereby he promises not
to suffer the Clergy to receive the goods of Laymen, which they call <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi>

but upon certain conditions. This is far from the point in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
therefore I held it fit to march further into their records, where I found
one Clause, that seems to make against the increasing the number of Bishops.
Which condition of their priviledges, unless I had resolved to be a faithful
Historian, I might safely have concealed; because they themselvs do not
mention it, that have, I am sure, written many things in mere malice to the
<hi>Spaniard:</hi>

will not suffer any to entrench upon the Offices,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                     </gap>6. And how viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by increase of Bishops.</note> 
                  <hi>Lands, or Goods of</hi> Abbots, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
<hi>or other religious persons within the Dukedome of Brabant, under the name
of a</hi> Commendum. But whilst, by the Kings procurement, Bishops were
entituled to the reversions of <hi>Monasteries,</hi> after the <hi>Abbots</hi> deceases; the
<hi>Brabanters</hi> seemed to have their Priviledges broken, and the people had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
offered, that the proceedings which every one hated for his private
benefit,<note place="margin">For which, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men rail at,</note> they might all in publick fairly declaim against, by the name of
<hi>Breach of Priviledge.</hi> Some therefore wondered, what was in the Kings
mind or counsel, to bring in new <hi>Bishops,</hi> &amp; make a thing, displeasing of it self,
far more distastfull and odious, by taking their estates from the <hi>Monasteries.</hi>
And therefore they further said, That if the King proceeded to violate the
Propriety and Liberty of the Subject,<note place="margin">And threaten the King.</note> the <hi>Brahanters</hi> had cause to defend
themselves, and that the Prince ought to remember, that when he made
their Charter, he articled,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>They should pay him no subjection or obedience, if he
entirely performed not to them his Oath and Protestations.</hi> Yet some there were
of a contrary opinion, and by how much they saw the King endeavour it,
with lesse benefit and greater danger to himself; so much the more they
commended his sincere religion, who in this business looked upon nothing,
but the good of his people.<note place="margin">From Precedents in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</note> And indeed, What was there apparent that
men could justly blame? the encrease of the number of the Bishops, or of
their maintenance? As if the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> might not do that in the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi>
which he had done in <hi>Germany</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> between which two
Nations in the middle,<note place="margin">Which makes against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the old Bishops.</note> lieth the <hi>Netherlands?</hi> Did not <hi>Boniface</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Mentz,</hi> Legate for the See Apostolick in <hi>Germany,</hi> when the multitude of
Christians abounded in some places (by the authority of the Popes <hi>Cregory</hi>
the third, and <hi>Zachary</hi>) adde three new Bishops to the former? The very
like cause there was among other reasons, for doing the same in the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Baronius, ann. 639. &amp; 741.</note>
But what motive was in <hi>France?</hi> the sacred jurisdiction of the
Bishop of <hi>Tholouse</hi> was so large, that one Pastor could not possible see the
faces of all his Diocese; and therefore it was divided into five Episcopall
Sees, by <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22;<note place="margin">Extrav. Solva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, de Praebend &amp; Dignit.</note> not onely no care taken of the Bishops of <hi>Narbon,
Bourges,</hi> or <hi>Cahors,</hi> out of whose estates both the Church of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> and
some of these new ones were endowed; but the Bishop of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> must
of necessity loose much of his revenues by the division of his then rich
Diocese. That the neighbour-<hi>Bishops</hi> ought not to have been called to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and heard in a business of this nature, their reasons for it being onely their
own profit and power,<note place="margin">As likewise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Lords.</note> is sufficiently apparent. Nor were the grievances of
the Lords built upon a much better ground, that is, they were discontented
that they should be limited in their bold disputes, about <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41239:23"/>
by the unwelcome presence of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> whom they ought to
honour as <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the Church, and to fear them as <hi>Revengers</hi>
of <hi>Sacriledge.</hi> For when they alledged, that they doubted the Bishops
would be evil Counsellours, and bandy against the King, it was a pretence
to cozen children with; they doubted themselves, that if they should appear
against the King, they should have these men for witnesses and adversaries,
that had received, and hoped for more from his Majesty, then ever the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors</hi>
did. Then the complaints of the <hi>Abbots</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>And against the Abbots.</hi> Aubertus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus in Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Episc.</note> were somewhat
more then became them. It was not without precedent, that a <hi>Bishop</hi> should
succeed in the place of an <hi>Abbot.</hi> Let them look upon <hi>France,</hi> they shall
find that <hi>Iohn</hi> the xxii, indowed the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Condom, Vabrince,</hi> and
<hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mbere</hi> (to name no more) with Monastery lands. And if there should
want an example, yet when it was granted to a Prince by the <hi>Pope,</hi> that may
command the <hi>Monks,</hi> they might have been so modest, as to teach others
obedience to his <hi>Holiness.</hi> They might have remembred, most of their
Mannors and Lordships, were the bounty of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Princes, which
made it seem more just; so as the King not making his own use or advantage
of the profits thereof, but onely employing them for the good and benefit
of those Provinces, the <hi>Abbots</hi> themselves ought to have been as willing as
the Prince, and contributed to the necessity of the people, by so much more
freely, by how much that Care is more proper to a religious life: and not
with unseasonable exclamations have corrupted a good designe, stirred up
the people, and alienated the <hi>Popes</hi> and the <hi>Kings</hi> mind from their patronage.
For the great grievance,<note place="margin">The literal sense of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</note> that the King had broke their Priviledges: First,
they did not sufficiently understand the difference, between a Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
and the Annexion of Church-livings. A Commendum being in the
nature of a thing deposited, the other given as to an absolute Lord. And
therefore Commendums, if the possessour die, revert to the depositor, as the
Lord Paramount; unless they be passed over to another by a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendum:
but such as are annexed, do not revert, but remain for ever
to the Successour in that Office, to which they are appendent. For
which reasons there is no more taken from <hi>Monasteries</hi> by annexing,
then was by giving them in <hi>Commendum,</hi> because that which is anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed,
doth no more revert to Monasteries, then that which was commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
forasmuch as what was once commended, is conferred again from one
to another, by the <hi>Pope,</hi> to whom it reverts. Nay whereas Church-livings
may be commended to non-residents, that cannot which is annexed to a
Bishoprick. For herein Religion requires the Bishops presence, farre more
then a <hi>Commendum;</hi> so as what might have come by a <hi>Commendum</hi> to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiner,
by <hi>Annexion</hi> was retained in the Low-Countreys.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Whence some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that they were not broken</hi> June 4. 1561. apud Arnold. Havens. de novis Episc. l. 2.</note> The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  </note> it was definitively resolved, that annexion of Livings, and
likewise the institution of new Bishopricks, was neither repugnant to the
Kings oath, nor to the laws. Again, they ought to consider the difference,
that was then from other times and manners: that while Religion was safe,
the King altered nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when it was endangered, there can be no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
to tie the hands of Kings from supporting their dominions falling into
ruine. The number of pastours was the fittest remedy to defend the flock of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41239:24"/>
Christ from wolves breaking in upon them; and sure there is none so great
an enemy to the King, but must acknowledge and believe it. Nor could
their endowments be proportioned with less inconvenience then they were,
by prudent men, to whom it was referred, with the Kings approbation,
and the <hi>Popes</hi> command.<note place="margin">And that the King was not obliged to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Estates Generall.</note> Nor was the Prince (which some required) bound to
do it by the advice of his great Councel, for he held himself obliged to it by
no law; and likewise his reason told him, the States (in a thing distastfull to
many, especially such as listened to hereticks their neighbours) would easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dissent, using the liberty which they took upon them in publick assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.
Whereby he should not onely expose his Prerogative and Majesty to
the <hi>dispute,</hi> but even to the <hi>contempt</hi> of his people: and that he should vex
their minds so much the more, by following his design, when they once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
their publick dislike, and passed their votes against it. But the King
might have provided for the new Bishops, or it, upon a fuller survey he had
found all other wayes more difficult, yet he himself should have maintained
them out of his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not out of other mens estates; without the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of his people,<note place="margin">Nor out of his own purse to allow mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the Bishops. Especially when he gave them Pensions.</note> without any mans prejudice? As if it were not just, that
the Bishops which were to serve the Low-Countreys, should be provided
for out of the Low-Countreys. Nor did the King spare his Exchequer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
every Bishop yearly one thousand five hundred crowns in pension,
till sufficient maintenance should be raised elsewhere. Albeit the King in
giving them the <hi>Abbots</hi> goods, did not directly bestow upon them other
mens estates, especially since he did it by authority of the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who is the true Administratour of their goods. To conclude, this
makes it plain, that although the King had given perpetuall pensions to the
<hi>Bishops,</hi> it would not have satisfied these men, that were not so much discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with the <hi>translations</hi> or <hi>annexions</hi> of Church-livings, as with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>number</hi> of the Bishops, which there being no reason to condemn, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to welcome, as a safe and ready help, it plainly appears, in case the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banters,</hi>
or other Low-Countreymen had took arms upon this ground, to
which side the beginning of those troubles was to be imputed. Neither
could this be the cause of rebellion.<note place="margin">Whether the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the tumults may be deduced from hence.</note> The substituting of Bishops in place of
Abbots when they should decease, and annexing of their livings to the
Bishopricks, was but executed in very few Cities; because of their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
petitions (which I shall in due place remember) presented to the <hi>Pope</hi>
and the <hi>King.</hi> I am sure in <hi>Brabant,</hi> which stood out the stiffest, the King at
last consenting, there was nothing altered. Yet I deny not, but those agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of diversly minded men, lessened obedience and duty to the Prince,
which are the pillars of government; and foreshewed, in case they should
be further moved, the ruine of the whole. For nothing is so pernicious to
Monarchy, as when the people are taught publickly to contest with their
Prince, and to dissent from him, not onely with <hi>impunity,</hi> but with <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing most of all troubled and exasperated the Low-Countreymen,<note place="margin">The Inquisition the <hi>third cause</hi> of Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
at first a suspicion, then an indeavour of setting up an inquisition against here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
to be confirmed by the Edict of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. Which in
regard it is commonly thought, to have opened a door of war in the Low-Countreys;
it will be worth my pains be what it may be, to give you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it. Religion, as it was ever highly reverenced by all, as that which
preserves the Worship of God, and Concord of Men: so the Christian

by Law. Afterwards, perhaps because that sacred Office is ingaged in
many cares; or because they are sometimes inforced to be absent from their
Diocese; or lastly, some of them may be negligent in the exercise of their
authority, and some happely ignorant; it seemed the best course, to dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
from the <hi>Apostolicall See, Iudges extraordinary,</hi> of approved learning

begun by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, who sent against the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> the
Founder of the preaching Fryars Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> that first executed the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of <hi>Inquisitour</hi> with much applause. The custome was afterwards recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
(almost in all that, and the next Age) in many Christian countreys,
there being created in every Province <hi>Censors</hi> of Faith, that should legally
take notice of the violation of religion.<note place="margin">The different forms thereof.</note> Yet in all places were not the same
Judicatories. Some had temporary Inquisitours sent about heresie newly
sprung up, and when that was extinguished, their commission ended. In
other parts a Tribunall was erected, to which, questions of faith were <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually</hi>
to be referred. In other places, the whole form of this judicature
being rejected, none but Bishops themselves were permitted to inquire of
hereticks. Nay, at <hi>Rome,</hi> the form was varied: for sometimes all was done
by the ordinary and Civill Magistrates, no Inquisitour extraordinary; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
many, but then one or more of the Cardinals were of the <hi>Quorum.</hi>
Till <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth instituted a Colledge of <hi>Cardinals,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Established in Rome</hi> Constit. 34. Licet.</note> by whose suffrages
these controversies were to be determined; establishing this course for ever
after in <hi>Rome</hi> by a more venerable and sacred Court of Justice.<note place="margin">Not without Penalties.</note> And that
it might more firmly continue, fear, the Beadle of the law, terrified them
from the beginning: penalties and fines being imposed upon, and exacted
of, the refractory: more easie ones by the <hi>Cannon law,</hi> and heavier by <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall</hi>
Edicts.<note place="margin">J, Manich, <hi>and</hi> l. Quicunque C. De haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</note> For when the Emperours observed, besides the worship of
God, that it concerns the publick Peace, whose Guardian the Prince is, that
subjects should be limited by Religion, and that they saw, when Religion
was endangered, peace could not live upon the foul and rough waves of
<hi>heresie,</hi> they decreed, that the punishment of <hi>traitours</hi> should be inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>hereticks,</hi> as enemies to Religion, and by consequence to Peace. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
notwithstanding, that the law should not be executed till their triall,<note place="margin">C. ut inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis. de hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticis, in 6.</note>
and verdict were passed in the Ecclesiasticall Court, to which the proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnizance
of heresie belongs. Which though it was ever exercised in all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Countreys, and in some places (according to sudden motions of
new perverse opinions) with greater diligence; yet no where with more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
and strictness, then in <hi>Spain:</hi> either out of the especiall inclination
of those <hi>Catholick</hi> Princes, or by reason of contagious forreiners that min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
themselves among those their subjects.<note place="margin">In <hi>Spain</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from the year 1383. <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Heresie makes it every where strictly observed.</note> But this care of Religion was
afterwards encreased, almost through all Christendome, by reason of the
troubles raised by one man in many parts, I mean <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of those and the following times. This mischief that he had long stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
to bring upon true believers, he had oft begun to attempt, and then
changing his mind, as if not resolved (or rather waiting for an opportunity)
at last <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour deceasing,<note place="margin">Emp. Max. 1.</note> and <hi>Charles</hi> his Nephew suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in the <hi>Empire,</hi> his wickedness broke forth; well knowing, that the
beginning of a Princes reign is the best time for Innovation; and likewise
believing the Emperours young years to be ignorant of government, and
therefore despicable. Howsoever he made sure account his <hi>Imperiall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie</hi>
would rather bend his endeavours to settle the affairs of his <hi>Empire,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:41239:25"/>
then to maintain the rites of the Church; so courting the Provinces first to
revolt from the Church; and then (which is the next step) from their
Princes, and from the Emperour himself; he thus broke in peices at once,
the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire and Religion. Which gave occasion to the Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi> to be much more observant, and intent to questions of faith; and to
Christian Princes, as every one tendered his Religion and Dominions, to
be more vigilant therein. Indeed <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the King, hinted to the people, and uttered as their own, was this:
<hi>Why he made so many new Bishops,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The common discourse against the Inquisition, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Edicts. In the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councel under <hi>Innocent</hi> iii.</note> 
                  <hi>if they were not to protect Religion? But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was resolved by Councels, that such Pastors as went slowly to work, in purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ill fruits of heresie, should be put out of their Episcopall office. Bishops
should therefore look to their own business, or else lay down their ill placed miters:
which it were better they had never put on, nor vainly frighted the Low-countrey
with their number: That Religion had flourished many ages in the</hi> Netherlands,
<hi>onely by the care of the Civil Magistrate, without that pomp of the</hi> Popes <hi>tyranny,
without any of the Emperours Edicts. Why that new addition of Inquisitors?
That for the most part, it sprung from the ambition of Bishop</hi> Granvell, <hi>who that
he might have suppliants, sought to make delinquents: That Religion ought to be
perswaded, not commanded: That</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth had a most pions intention in
making those Laws, but experience demonstrated, the cause of Religion, and the
common good and state of the Provinces, was thereby nothing advanced, but daily
grew to be in a worse condition: That commerce was already obstructed; Merchants
had a stop of trading, to the great losse of the Low-countreymen, especially those of</hi>
Antwerp, <hi>whose wealth consisted in merchandize. Lastly, that neither the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi>
Charles, <hi>nor King</hi> Philip, <hi>nor any other</hi> Prince <hi>that had sworn to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of</hi> Brabant, <hi>and promised not to impose upon the Low-countreymen new
forms of Iudicature, could have power (if the Laws remained in force) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
them to suffer the severity of the</hi> Inquisition, <hi>and those Edicts.</hi> But these
rumours moved not the Governess at all; who continued to execute the Law
upon offenders.<note place="margin">Tumults caused by fear of the Inquisition, and punishment of Delinquents.</note> And the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> then ended, was by the Kings
command proclaimed in the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi> At which, in some places, the
people openly stormed, and rescued condemned persons, half dead, out of
the hangmans hands; stealing to <hi>conventicles</hi> in the City, and in the fields.
Nay, many of the Nobility entered into a kind of combination among
themselves; partly to scatter libels in the streets, partly to present petitions to
the Governess by great multitudes; with such tumult and success, that the
Emperours Edicts had their edge abated, delinquents were pardoned, and
no one afterwards endeavoured to bring in <hi>Censors</hi> of faith, where they had
not formerly been. So that nothing was done to oppose the <hi>Preaching-men,</hi>
that had broke loose from their hereticall neighbours; and in the very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket

Boors and rogues presently joyning, rushed into the Churches, robbed them,
defaced the sacred Monuments; and lastly, fell into open rebellion, without
any Generall then declaring for them; but with strange licentiousness, force,
rapine, and plunder.<note place="margin">Some men cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the King.</note> To this point it was come at last. And some affirmed
that storm, which with a sudden noise prodigiously fell upon the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes,

my self, all I have hitherto set down, did indeed contribute to the
<hi>Belgick</hi> tumults, but were not the principall causes of them. It is now my
purpose clearly to explain those causes to you, that such as read my history
may learn, by the example of the Low-countrey men, what it is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

with as little reluctation, as they that revolt from their King, contemn
his subordinate Magistrates. Indeed among humane things I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
most admired, that in the Government of Cities and Kingdoms;
so many millions of men should be subjected and awed by one. This
consists in the Subjects <hi>consent,</hi> and that consent is grounded upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and fear, especially because it concerns particulars, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
should be governed. But this pail of Government Heresie puls up
and opens; whose trumpeters under the specious pretence of Christian liberty
sound in the ears of the people (not deaf to scandalous reports) continual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives
against the Manners and Lives of Princes. Which Teachers having
seasoned the peoples minds with these holy Precepts, it is no marvel if they
detract so much from the Princes Power of ruling, and add so much to their
own freedom from obeying. Nature hath planted in men, an aversion from
their Lords, and an impatience to be commanded; what will they do, blown
by the dayly breath of preaching? and being safe and confident under the
veil of Religion. The <hi>Transalpine</hi> Countreys are and will be a sufficient
example to Posterity: Which heresie hath too often <hi>prea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hed</hi> into arms,
by the sermons of a few seditious persons, that have involved Provinces and
Nations in never to be expiated slaughter. So that what I said is evident,
without wonderfull change in the Civill Government, Religion cannot be
altered. And although heresie till that time had not so crept into the
Low-countreys,<note place="margin">What Occasions Heresie made use of to raise tumults in the Low-countreys.</note> nor was so numerous, that the faction could be greatly
feared, many of the common sort being uncorrupted. Yet when those
very men saw the Bishops multiplied; the Emperours Edicts published;
and Inquisitours of faith imposed; the hereticks openly ringing in their
ears, that all these conspired to destroy their liberty, they all then joyned
their forces. For the Low-countreymen alwayes preserved their great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
and Franchises, and did more securely enjoy them, by reason they
had now been governed by female Princes for forty years together. Add
to this the last long War: in which time, Licentiousness follows the Camp,
and the Prince divides his Empire with the souldier: The Low-countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
therefore with long liberty and the late warre grown stubborn, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with hereticks, and learning pride of those masters, no wonder, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more insolent then they used to be, when occasion was offered, they
would not onely not hear the word of command, and cast off their new
burthens, but with erected spirits hoped for greater matters by the example
of others. For they looked upon <hi>France,</hi> where after the tumult at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Another Cause of the Belgick Insurrections, the alienation of the Nobility.</note>
the hereticks had extorted so great a liberty, as they grew formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Kingdome: and were to be sought to, for peace. But this spurre
of the people, <hi>heresie,</hi> could never (as I say) have made such a progress in
the Low-countreys, without the protection and assistance of the Nobility,
for if heresie want this Elm, she creeps indeed, but on the ground, and to be
trampled upon. And most of the Nobility were then in such a condition,
and did so stomack the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Which grew principally out of Court-emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> that the Commons might (and not rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)

Lords governed; the Low-countreymen had the best places at Court; the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41239:27"/>
highest commands in the Army. Afterwards when many great persons,
out of <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> dayly came in to <hi>Cesars</hi> fortune every
day more flourishing, it was necessary his graces and bounties should f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
Nor were the Low-countreymen troubled at it; because they saw
the Emperours inclination chiefly propense towards them; and to contend
with forreign Nobility, they held it an honour to their Countrey. But
when King <hi>Philip</hi> came from <hi>Spain,</hi>

both in his <hi>Palace</hi> and <hi>abroad,</hi> as they said, inaccessible; the Low-countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
took offence at their being over gracious with the King, jeering their
manners and fashions, which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in all places punctually retains.
Lastly,<note place="margin">The difference of disposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth,</note> they were by degrees alienated from the King himself, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasted
them with being so unlike his father. For the Emperour easily gave
access and audience, carrying himself like a private man, altogether trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own Majesty. And as he had a wit that could winde and turn it
self all Wayes at once, he did so put on their Manners, that he was no less a
<hi>German</hi> with a <hi>German,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> with an <hi>Italian,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> with a <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
then a Low-countreyman with his native Subjects. Where on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">And King <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </note>
King <hi>Philip</hi> would be, and appear a <hi>Spaniard</hi> to all men; he spake sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and then all <hi>Spanish;</hi> and forbare to shew himself in publick, as if he
meant, appearing after retirement, to strike a reverence in the eyes of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders;
changing nothing of the mode of <hi>Spain,</hi> either in his apparell or
other forms of State. Now this, by minds once vexed, was accounted
Pride and Contempt: as if his diversity of manners were in scorn of them.
It is reported, the Emperour gave his sonne warning of it, and being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at words used by some <hi>Spaniards</hi> against the Low-countreymen; in
the presence of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Bossuvius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in his <hi>Apology</hi> Anno 1581.</note> he told the King, that he
foresaw the counsels of some of the Kings flatterers would one day hazard
him the loss of the Low-countreys. And although, after the Emperours
decease, the King was in war with <hi>France,</hi> and the Nobility emploied abroad,
which quieted the stirres at home:<note place="margin">The <hi>Belgick</hi> Lords deseated of their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations.</note> Yet the war being ended, the Discontent
at Court grew so much higher then it was, by how much the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Lords thought the King more indebted to them, for their valiant and
faithfull service in his wars. Nor were they satisfied with his bestowing
upon them so many Governours places before his departure.<note place="margin">Which caused their animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties against the King.</note> For such as
were neglected, took it for an injury: and they that were chosen, held it no
great bounty, because they exspected a greater. But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
and Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> as they were of vaster spirits then the rest, having abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
perswaded themselves, they should have the Government of all the
seventeen Provinces: when they fell, from that hope, whatsoever came short
of their wishes lost the title of a benefit. From whence sprung the Low-countreymens
fury; which is ever most dangerous to Princes, when men
have not what they hope for, though many times they hope for more then
they should have. It was not <hi>Pompeys</hi> Party that murthered <hi>Iulius Cesar,</hi>
but his won friends:<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Ira, c. 10.</note> because (as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith) he had not satisfied their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfiable
hopes. As if when men are much obliged, it were a kind of affront
not to be more obliged.<note place="margin">And afforded them matter of complaint.</note> And now in the private discourses of the Nobility
this was their ordinary matter of complaint, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had all the
power with the King, That the Low-countreymen were but the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
shadows, that waited upon them, and moved at their command; for the
King transacted business of great concernment by the advice of <hi>Ferdinand</hi>

Counsellours, That the Low-countrey Lords were admitted to the
Counsell-board to pass things already concluded: and were pleased, like
children with form and ceremony. This was not the Emperours promise
of his sons bounty, nor what was due to their fidelity and service. Should
they suffer themselves to be turned out, and forreiners to be quartered in
their houses, and Low-countreymen to be despised, and thought so much
inferiour to the Spaniards? Yet they endured it, while the King stayed
among them; either fearing the Majesty of their Prince, or else faithfull
even in anger. Nor did they proceed further then private murmurs, save
onely their hatred to the <hi>Spanish</hi> took a deeper impression in themselves, and
by them was spread among the people, that long since hated the very name
of <hi>Spaniard.</hi> But when the King went for <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Court was free

Lord of <hi>Granvel,</hi> who was of mean parentage; and (as some say)
son to a Black-smith; but a man of excellent endowments, and great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and succeeded in the place of <hi>Mercurinus Arboreus Gattinar, Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi>
of the Empire, trusted with, and acting in, all the Emperours De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fignes.
For at the great Convention of the Estates of <hi>Germany</hi> in <hi>Vangion,</hi>
he sate President, representing his <hi>Imperiall Majestie;</hi> who sent him out of
<hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Trent,</hi> to do honour to the Councel, and to promise the Emperours
presence there. Nor did the Chancellour loose any opportunity, but in
that famous meeting of all Christendome, silently advanced the service of
his Prince. He was the onely man chosen by the Emperour to publish his
Decrees of greatest consequence in <hi>Germany;</hi> to make peace between the
petty Princes; and to work them to joyn with the Emperour, in perswading
the free Cities to give assistance to King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to move the Fathers to
end the Councel, that he might at once settle the cause of Religion, the
Councels of War, and the Imperiall Laws. In all which employments,
and the slippery Court affairs, he ever kept his footing firm; and had the
Emperours constant favour, for twenty years together, till his very dying
day. A rare end of a long continued power.<note place="margin">He died in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, An. 1550. His happiness in his issue. <hi>Anthony Granvels</hi> Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> He was likewise happy in

and excellent learning, and proceeding with great applause in most of the
Universities in <hi>Europe;</hi> by his fathers instructions, he easily obtained the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Art of business. So that when he came to be a Statesman, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
won upon the Emperours good liking; and made it appear, that he
relied not so much upon his fathers virtue, as his own. In many things he
equalled his father, in many exceeded him. Especially in nimbleness of
wit, tiring sometimes five Secretaries at once, with dictating letters to them,
and that in severall tongues; for he understood seven languages exactly.<note place="margin">Languages.</note> But
his greatest excellency was his eloquence,<note place="margin">Elocution.</note> wherein none of that Age surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him. He had audience in the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> for the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and made a quick and handsome speech, being then Bishop
of <hi>Arras,</hi> of twenty four years of age, in his fathers time. He was called

(knowing such Commendations to be good while they are fresh, but
that when our Parents memory grows out of date, they often turn to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
as if they had in them more of Command then Duty) hastened to
merit the Kings favour with admirable dexterity. For though it be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to please a Successour, commonly differing in nature and manners:<note place="margin">And he effected his designe, being employed in things of highest concernment.</note> yet
<hi>Granvel</hi> overcame all that difficulty by <hi>Observance.</hi> And as he had a wit
that could easily new-cast it self into any mould, he transformed himself
immediately into the manners of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Prince. His studying to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
Religion against Heresie, in which he strangely hit the inclination of
the King; his mind neither greedy in seeking honours, nor unfit for them
when offered; his subtilty in decyphering the Princes mind, before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himself in his Commands; conjecturing them by his looks: his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinency
by night from sleep, by day from meat; his constant pains and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
far above the practice of the Court, did exceedingly engage the Kings
affections to him. His knowledge of the Emperours Counsels, likewise
much endeared him to King <hi>Philip,</hi> who by the same Compass meant to
steer his Government. For which reasons, in all his four years stay in the
Low-countreys, the King did nothing either at home or abroad, made nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
peace nor leagues, with Kings or Nations; concluded no marriages;
quieted no seditions; acted nothing that related to Religion or the Church,
but the <hi>Granvell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And by the King commended to the Governess.</note> he delivered his commands. Nay, when the King went
from the <hi>Low-countreys</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> he left this man to the Dutchess of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
as a principall instrument of State: and told her, it concerned the
<hi>Low-countreys,</hi> that she should use his advice oftner then any other of the
Councel. And she did it, so that he had the same place and esteem with the
Kings sister,<note place="margin">His favour with her.</note> that he had with the King. His power (which rarely happens)
being thrice successively confirmed. Seldome any private or publick busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

was to be surprized: So dextrous he was, and his counsel so appliable to all
occasions,<note place="margin">His dexterity in giving counsel.</note> that the Prince was free to choose, and thought himself Authour
of the determinions, for which <hi>Granvel</hi> by his own judgement had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him; and could not but love the Modesty of his inventions, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
(which is unsufferable to Princes) to commend the wisdome of his
Teacher. And though <hi>Garnvell,</hi> under shew of observance, arrived at once

great volume of his letters, which he sent her (though they were both in

doubted, but that all was transacted by <hi>Granvell,</hi> both at home and abroad:
and as it often happens, things he had no hand in (when once his name was

then they took notice of him as a Competitour.<note place="margin">And then emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late him.</note> And because he seemed
to stand upon even ground with them; they began to raise batteries against

it a dishonour to be outbraved by Forreiners, especially by the <hi>Spanish</hi>

since on the one part, no revenues would hold out to maintain these scenes
of Pride;<note place="margin">Both which at last contributed to the ruine of the Publick.</note> and yet they had still in their small fortunes, great spirits, sensible
of the honour of their Families. On the other part, while the hereticks, to
avoid banishment, or the hangman (which was the business then in agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
promised to the Nobility money in abundance, and especially to the
Governours of Provinces. Diverse Noblemen, upon these hopes, easily

                  </note> came to his Cousen german <hi>William,</hi>
whom we now speak of, by the favour of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth.
<hi>William</hi> was born in the year one thousand five hundred thirty three,<note place="margin">Henr. Ranzou. in exemplis Astvol. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Airzin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Leone Belg.</note> the

desired to know his sonnes fortune of <hi>Philip Melanchthon</hi> that was by

<hi>Williams</hi> fortune was not in all parts alike proportioned. For at first, his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41239:32"/>
starres would shine down honour upon him him: afterwards, he should
lay his design for greater honours: but at last, come to an unfortunate end.
What his judgement was of the other four brothers, I have neither heard
spoken, nor seen written. Perhaps, because they wanted <hi>success,</hi> they were
passed over in <hi>silence:</hi> lest it might discredit his art. <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth took
him away when he was very young, from his father, who had revolted to
the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and delivered him to his own sister, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
As soon as his years permitted,<note place="margin">His civill.</note> the Emperour made him a gentleman of
his bed-chamber, and was much delighted with the constant waiting and
conditions of the youth: because he was very modest, and did not make
vain ostentations of his service, nor omit any oportunity to be serviceable:
and that in a grave and serious manner; that he might be thought more
<hi>capeable</hi> then <hi>ambitious</hi> of imployment.<note place="margin">And military education.</note> From the bed-chamber, where he
kept his place for almost nine years, the Emperour made him a souldier, and
Generall of his horse in the Low-countreys. Nay when the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
left the army,<note place="margin">Called the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Bands. <hi>Emmanuel Fishberti</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                  </note> he substituted in his place <hi>William Nassau</hi> Lieutenant-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall:
though he wanted years for so great a command, being not past
twenty two, and was brought in over the heads of many great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
among others (which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> himself admired) of
Count <hi>Egmont:</hi> who besides his experience in the warres, was twelve years
older. Thenceforth, as well in peace as war, he was by the Emperour va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
in the first file of Nobility; and imployed upon diverse noble <hi>Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His favour at Court.</note>
Indeed, in the Emperours great resignment of his dominions; which
was his last act as a Prince, when he sent the Crown and Sceptre of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
(as we have told you) to his brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
he clearly shewed, by that last honour he could do, the greatness of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which he bare him.<note place="margin">Some suspect him.</note> And though some, that suspected his nature
from the first, often wished the Emperour to look to him, and not to be
over confident of his disposition; which under the pretence of virtue, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
fraud and design; and that he should take heed how he cockered up
that fox in his bosome, that one day would devour all his domestick Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
But the Emperour frowned upon and contemned these aspersions,
knowing they are ordinarily cast upon such as Princes favour. Nay these
rather confirmed him in the Emperours good opinion. Howsoever by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
honourable mention of him,<note place="margin">The Emperour answers all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</note> and commending the modesty and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the youth, the Emperour seemed to discharge that envy. Perhaps he
thought the Prince deserved it not; perhaps it was the common fault of
<hi>masters,</hi> that apprehend themselves to be no less concerned in such inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives,
then their <hi>favourites</hi> and <hi>servants;</hi> and without looking into the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
make themselves patrons of the men, whose cause they think their
own. Yet in the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> at that very time, were symptomes of a
disease,<note place="margin">And commends him to the King.</note> that should have been prevented, or at least observed. Which sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes
grew more and more apparent after the Emperours departure. For
though at his leaving the Low-countreys, the Emperour commended the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to his sonne <hi>Philip,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King makes great account of him.</note> and King <hi>Philip</hi> both of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and for his fathers sake, gave him many testimonies of his good liking;
for he made him one of the Order of the Golden fleece, sent him t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a peace with <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Frensh King;</hi> and that done, deliverec him
for hostage. And to those large Provinces of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which the
King trusted to his Government, he added <hi>Burgundy,</hi> though farre remote.
But what could all this work with him,<note place="margin">The Causes of his Discontent.</note> that gave out, the King was obliged
to bestow upon him the absolute Government of all the Low-countreys,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41239:32"/>
for his pains and expences, to defend the greatness of the house of <hi>Austria.</hi>
And in his Apology against King <hi>Philip,</hi> he took upon him the boldness
(after he had particularized the merits of his Ancestours towards the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<hi>Maximilian</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi>) to conclude, That but for the Counts of
<hi>Nassau,</hi> and Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could not have loaded the
front of his proclamation (wherein he proscribed him) with the glorious
titles of so many Kingdomes and Nations. Frustrated therefore of his
hopes to govern the Low-countreys; and perceiving <hi>Granvell</hi> to be the
great man in the Dutchesses new Court, and fearing he should every day be
less esteemed by her, whom he would have prevented of her Government,
by professing himself to stand for <hi>Christiern</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to bring her in; he resolved to maintain his greatness by another
way: and, provoked by new indignities,<note place="margin">His Designe,</note> to act what he had long since de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.
And though I have no certain ground to believe, that at the very
first, he laid his plot to revolt from his allegiance to the King; yet I dare
boldly affirm, he studied, at that time, some innovation: whereby he might
weaken the Kings Government; overthrow the <hi>Spanish</hi> power; incourage
the hereticall party; by right or wrong advance his own honour and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and if fortune made him any other fair offer,<note place="margin">His Wit and Manners.</note> to lay hold upon it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for altering of a Government, I know not if any man ever lived, fitter
then the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> He had a present wit, not slow to catch at opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
but subtill; concealing himself, not to be sounded, even by those
that were thought privy to his secrets. Then he had a rare way to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
himself with any that but came to speak with him:<note place="margin">Which relished not of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or Levity.</note> so unaffectedly he
conformed to strangers manners, and served himself of others ends; not that
he stooped to the poor forms of complement, and common professions of
imaginary services, wherewith at this day men do honourably mock one
another. But shewing himself, neither sparing nor prodigall of his
Courtship, he so cunningly contrived his <hi>words,</hi> that you could not
but think, that he reserved farre more for <hi>action.</hi> Which begat a greater
opinion of his discretion: and gave more credit to his pretensions. Besides,
though he was of a proud and infinitely ambitious spirit; yet he so carried it
to the outward shew, that he seemed to command himself, and not to be
sensible of injuries. But he was as subiect to fear, as free from anger: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as he doubted all things, thought every thing unsafe: but yet desist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not; because on the one part his brain, fruitfull in plots, if the first took
not, presently made new supplies; on the other part, his vast and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ambition,<note place="margin">The splendour of his Family.</note> strangled all doubts and delayes. But in the splendour of
his house-keeping, and the multitude of his friends and followers, he was
equall to great Princes. No man in all the Low-countreys more hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that gave nobler entertainment to forrein Embassadours, then the
Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> which hugely pleased the people, that delight to have the
wealth and power of their Countrey showed to strangers: nor was it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastfull
to Princes, with whom he redeemed all the opinion of his pride,
by his humble and familiar invitations of their servants.<note place="margin">His doubtfull Religion.</note> But for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that was very doubtfull, or rather none at all. When he was with the
Emperour and the King, he seemed to be Catholick. When they left the
<hi>Low-countreys,</hi> he returned by little and little to his Fathers heresie, which
was bred in him of a child: yet so, as while the Dutchess of <hi>Parma</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Governess, he rather appeared a Favourer of the hereticall party,<note place="margin">He declares himself a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinist. <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> 1518.</note> then
an Heretick. Lastly, after the Dutchess was removed, he declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for <hi>Calvin</hi> (for from a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> he was now turned to his opinion) not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41239:33"/>
onely as a private Sectary; but as the great Defender of his Faith. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he writ a Book,<note place="margin">His Apology, <hi>Anno</hi> 1518.</note> wherein he testified to all the world, That from his
childhood, he was ever much enclined to the Religion (which he calls Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
the seeds whereof his heart alwayes constantly retained; which at
length ripened with his years. And that all he did at home, or in the warrs,
related to this end, To maintain Religion in her first Purity, assailed and shot
at, with so many Laws and Edicts by the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> Whether
he wrote truth, and was indeed a <hi>Calvinist</hi> in opinion;<note place="margin">Whether from his heart or no, is uncertain.</note> or rather by that
means sought to ingratiate himself with the men, whose service he had use
of, some have made a doubt: it is most probable, his Religion was but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
which he could put on like a Cloke, to serve him for such a time;
and put it off again, when it was out of fashion. Truly, that Religion was
not much to be regarded,<note place="margin">Ann. 1581.</note> when Authority was to be acquired, or establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
are the words of his own letter to <hi>Alençon,</hi> Brother to the <hi>French King;</hi>
part whereof in its due place, I shall insert. This, it was thought, he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the villanous school of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> whose Books he seriously studied;
as <hi>Granvel</hi> affirms in his Letter from <hi>Spain,</hi> directed to <hi>Alexander</hi> Prince of

abruptly and obscurely,<note place="margin">He discovers both the Kings designes against the hereticks.</note> lest perhaps he might reveal it to one, that was not
of counsel with them) the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as he himself sayes, to wyer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the whole business out of the King, takes upon him to have been long
privy to the plot, which the King easily believes, thinking the Prince in
great esteem with his Master, and seeing him his hostage there. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
freely tells him, that by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadour, the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi>
King <hi>Philip,</hi> agreed with him to destroy all the families of the new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
which he was to see done in <hi>France,</hi> and King <hi>Philip</hi> in the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys:
in which he likewise had erected a constant Tribunal, where matters
of Faith should be tried, which would be as good as his Forts, to keep his
people in obedience. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> finding the designe, which he
knew to be King <hi>Philips,</hi> return'd into the Low-countreys. There when he
saw the Dutchess of <hi>Parma</hi> made Governess, and <hi>Granvel</hi> joyned with
her; the number of Bishops increased; and Inquisitors of Faith to be
brought in; he conceived this to be the designe which King <hi>Henry</hi> had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to him.<note place="margin">And from thence takes his hint for Commotion.</note> And when he perceived that these new Decrees had fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Cities with fears and jealousies, and that no part of the State looked
cheerfull; he resolved to make use of the opportunity: supposing, that if
he should feed the beginnings of these discontents on his part, as many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
(corrupted with heresie) would do on theirs;<note place="margin">Ann. 1559.</note> that he should undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
elude the designes of the <hi>Spanish.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beginning at the Convention of the Knights of the Golden Fleece, out of the same <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</hi>
                  </note> And now that he had some little
glimmering of an exspectation, and began to form great plots to bring all
his aims to their desired ends, thus he set them a work.</p>
               <p>The King,<note place="margin">Hoventius Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morancy, <hi>Lord</hi> Montany, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Lalin <hi>Count</hi> Hoch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat.</note> at <hi>Gant,</hi> called a Chapter of the Knights of the Golden Fleece,
in whose Creation (because all authority was not in the King, as Master of
the Order, but in the joynt-votes of his Companions) that some might be
chosen which hated the King, (I suppose, <hi>Monting</hi> and <hi>Hochstrat</hi>) the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> took a great deal of pains, solicited, and prevailed with his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41239:33"/>
to promise him their severall suffrages. And both these Lords now
obliged, he meant hereafter, as purchased by this favour, to make use of.
Besides, when the Cities mutinied (as I have told you) because <hi>Spanish</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
were left upon the frontiers;<note place="margin">Starting matter for sedition out of the <hi>Spanish</hi> souldiers.</note> he privately inflamed their fury; and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
with his friends of the pride of those forrein souldiers, that under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of defending the Borders, laboured to put a yoke upon free Cities.
Withall, he commended the loyaltie of the <hi>Low-countreymen,</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
suffered, for that strangers were preferred before them.<note place="margin">1559.</note> And
put it in their heads,<note place="margin">In the some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology.</note> that the Estates who were then to be summoned, should
with great earnestness petition the King, that his <hi>Spanish</hi> souldiers might be
disbanded, by his Fathers example, who never had any Garrisons in the
<hi>Low-countreys,</hi> but of Low-countrey men; which accordingly the States
were suiters for, with great noise and clamour. And at that time, the King
promised to satisfie them by word of mouth, which afterward he really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> much glorying in it, who, in his Letters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
himself to have been the authour of sending away the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> and
that by this act (which he accounted an eternal honour to him and his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues)
he brought two things about: the one, that he freed his Countrey
from slavery; the other, that he opened (they are his own words) the way
to Religion. Onely to his and their Crown of glory this was wanting:
that as they had turned the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> so they had
not shut the door upon them, locked it fast, guarded the Passe, and kept
them from all hope of ever coming back again. Yet he doubted not, but
as he had purged a great part of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> of them, so as they could
call nothing there their own, but the bones and ashes of their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
in like manner he should quickly bring to effect, or at least endeavour
it, that they should all be banished out of the seventeen Provinces, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compelled to return to their own Countrey, should at last suffer the
Low Dutch to enjoy the liberty of their fortunes,<note place="margin">Out of the new Bishops.</note> bodies and souls. Nor
was he less active against the designe of introducing new Bishops; which
(by the spirit of <hi>Calvin</hi>) he used to call <hi>hangmen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In his said A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. and so <hi>Granvel</hi> writes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ann. 1582.</note> brought in to flea and
burn mankind. And to that end, he applied himself to the <hi>Abbots,</hi> some of
which (instructed at private conferences, and emboldened against the fear of
any Magistrate) were for a great while his principall instruments of discord.
But he had not better success in any thing, then in defeating the Emperours
Edicts, and the Kings proclamations. For as nothing more amazed the
people, then the name of the <hi>Inquisition;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Out of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition.</note> so the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in that
fright, aggravating their fears and jealousies, telling them of the breach of
Priviledge, the <hi>tyranny</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the slavery of the <hi>Low-countrey men,</hi>
most of them <hi>vain surmizes,</hi> but yet working in minds inclined to suspicion:
It is hardly credible, what an <hi>odium</hi> he brought upon the Inquisition; how
he turned the <hi>Peoples</hi> hearts from the <hi>King,</hi> and made them hate the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi>

be lost, if this went on) would assoon have let into their cities the Enemies
of their Countrey,<note place="margin">Out of <hi>Granvels</hi> power.</note> as the <hi>Inquisitours</hi> of Faith. The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
glad of this successe, and being (as I have said) inraged at <hi>Granvels</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
absolutely resolved to joyn with the People and the Hereticks, who (he

publickly renounced their allegiance: the more high-hearted grew the

Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> His hopes, which hitherto were uncertain and farr off,
now came near and courted him. So that scorning the Court, he looked for
greater and quicker fortunes in the Warrs. But the mischief daily encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
seditious Citizens joyned with the Hereticks;<note place="margin">The mutinous Citizens and the Hereticks desire to have the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> for their Generall.</note> part necessitated to avoid
punishment, but the major part invited with hope of liberty. That their
pretences might shew more honest, and promise more safety, under some
one Generall; they looked upon the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whom they knew to
be ambitious to command in chief, and therefore an enemy to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi>
besides, that he was seasoned with heresie, at least ingaged by affinity with
Hereticks, whose service he made use of. They likewise knew he had many
strong towns of his own, and that he would be supported by the counsels
and wealths of forrein Princes. And he himself was partly incouraged by
his inclination to the Hereticks, (to favour which party, he was at home per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
by his wife,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anne</hi> daughter to <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</hi>
                  </note> his brother, and his friends; abroad by great Persons)
partly out of hatred, first to <hi>Granvel,</hi> afterwards to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> especially, because despairing of the Kings favour,
he hardly saw any place left for drawing back his hand, when he had cast the
Die: partly, by the opportunity of Command, which from all quarters
was offered to him.<note place="margin">He offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> Upon these motives he wholly revolted to them, for
whose defence he had the colour of protecting their Liberties; with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
matter of feeding his own hopes. And thus, what neither the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Publick.</note> nor any <hi>Generall</hi> whatsoever could have done without a routiny

by a conspiracy of both, a sudden flame of Rebellion breaking out,
which afterwards continued a long fire of Warr, equally pernicious to the
<hi>Conquerours,</hi> and the <hi>conquered.</hi>

whether Misfortunes <hi>succeed</hi> or <hi>meet.</hi> And as by the conjunction of starrs,
ill winds they say are generated; so questionless there is a conjuncture of
evils in the destruction of Men and Kingdoms. The sudden inundation of
Heresie, the peoples dislike of the <hi>Spanish</hi> souldiers, the Multiplication of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
the Revival of the <hi>Emperours</hi> Edicts, with the punishment of Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
the <hi>defeated hopes</hi> of the Nobility, <hi>Granvels greatness</hi> at Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they all happened together, easily raised those tumults and troubles.
Nevertheless, all were not of one Quality; for many of them seemed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nester
Pretences then the rest; but two of them did the business, Heresie and
Ambition: though going under other Names, borrowing elsewhere their
occasions, and beginnings: For the Hereticks having made the People
theirs, pretended the Priviledges of the <hi>Low-countreys;</hi> and lest the Dutchess
of <hi>Parma,</hi> their Governess should oppresse them, they put themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Protection of the Nobility. These gudgeons were greedily swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by many; some set on by Poverty, more by their Repulses and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts,
most by the Power of <hi>Granvel.</hi> Nothing could therefore advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
them but troubles, wherein they should receive Pay from the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and Imployment from the Governess: and by that means <hi>Granvels</hi>
Power would decay for want of Action. The peoples contumacy thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
with their strength, they despised Government, terrified the Cities
with seditious tumults, and immediately after in many places, violated and
robbed the Churches. Lastly, in some places were discovered evident
signes of subjects intending a Revolt, which was now set a foot.</p>
               <p>And thus much I have discovered of the Originall of the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Tumults: which before the departure of the Dutchess of <hi>Parma</hi> out
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41239:34"/>
of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> being laid and almost extinguished, revived again, farre
more fatally in the Government of the Duke of <hi>Alva;</hi> whilst their Abettor
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> took opportunity of the peoples falling into rebellion;
but not likely to hold out long, without a General: and upon their open defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from their Prince, he long opposed the <hi>Spanish forces,</hi> as their General.

WARRES. The third Book.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He new Governess took care in the first place to send
away the <hi>Spanish</hi> souldiers.<note place="margin">1559.</note> For the Provinces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
(as I have shewed you) that the four moneths
were past,<note place="margin">The Spanish souldiers have Orders to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</note> wherein the King promised to free the Low-countreys
of forrein souldiers; and yet, they were kept
in Garrison: but the Dutchess of <hi>Parma</hi> had put it off so
long, because she most confided in the valour and faith
of the old souldiers, if any troubles should arise at home, by the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
example of their neighbours, that were together by the ears about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Which was the cause that when the Low-countreymen denyed
their Pay, she her self borrowed money to supply them. But the Low-countreymens
complaints dayly multiplying, they alledged to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that the King had obliged himself in honour; and her husband <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> (who never liked the stop of the <hi>Spanish</hi> army in the
<hi>Netherlands</hi>) at his departure into <hi>Italy,</hi> perswading his wife to let them go;
she writ letters to the King for his assent. And upon the receit of money
from <hi>Spain,</hi> together with the Kings Commission, her Excellence drew
out the Garrisons from the border-towns, commanding them presently to
march to <hi>Ulushen,</hi> and to go abroad with the first fair wind, for <hi>Spain.</hi> But
while shipping was prepared, winter coming on, the Governess received an
Express from the <hi>King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. Octob.</note> enjoyning her not yet to send away the <hi>Spanish</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons:
but (as in her discretion she thought fit) to spinne out time,<note place="margin">Their Departure countermanded by the King.</note> till the
King sent his absolute determination. And I believe, his Majesty alwayes
desired their stay in the Low-countreys; yet perhaps he was more moved
to it, by new suspicions, collected out of <hi>Granvels</hi> letters, who having an
eye upon the actions of the Nobility, made an ill construction of their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernesse
to expell the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> and perhaps penetrated further into the
Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> designes. But the Dutchess could not at that time obey
the King, by reason the hatred and quarrell between the two Nations was
then irreconciliable. For the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were inraged because the Low-countreymen
were so violent to have them gone.<note place="margin">Whereat the Low-countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men rage.</note> And the Low-countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
vexed with new grievances, were the more fierce in urging their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41239:35"/>
So as the <hi>Zelanders</hi> (in whose islands the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had lyen for
a wind) being now grown desperate,<note place="margin">And grow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate.</note> resolved to work no more upon the
sea banks: but though before their eyes the water bore them down in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places, yet they said, they had rather have their land <hi>drowned,</hi> then <hi>plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</hi>
So, long since,<note place="margin">Tacitus <hi>in his</hi> Annals. <hi>l.</hi> 13.</note> the Generall of the <hi>Ancibarians</hi> vowed to do, in the
same place, against the <hi>Romanes.</hi> Nay they professed openly, in the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
hearing, The sea should swallow them alive, ere they would set foot
out of doors to hinder it, as long as forrein souldiers tread upon their
ground. Yet the <hi>Governess</hi> to comply with the Kings desires, delayed the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> going aboard; and debated, how she might call them back from
<hi>Zeland,</hi> in her Cabinet councell:<note place="margin">Called the <hi>Consult.</hi>
                  </note> and with some few others of approved
faith, whom she joyned to them. But all things were represented full of
marvellous difficulty.<note place="margin">1560.</note> 
                  <hi>For they could not be called back, before Towns were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for them to be quartered in;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Consulters are of opinion the souldiers should not be stayed.</note> 
                  <hi>but those could not be appointed, without their
Governours, who would, no doubt, protest against it. Then it was to be considered,
whether they should be kept in their winter quarters in a body? but that would be
insufferable to the City that should give them quarter: or whether they should be
dispersed through the Provinces? but then they must be exposed to all injuries and
indignities, which the people (that contemned their small number) would be sure
to put upon them. It was likewise considerable, Where the</hi> Spaniards <hi>should have
pay? since the Low-countreys had vowed to part with no money neither to them,
nor their own Countreymen, till the</hi> Netherlands <hi>should be cleared of forrein
force.</hi> Though the Governess knew this to be so,<note place="margin">1560.</note> yet that she might leave
nothing unattempted; Or by consulting to gain time, she brought the whole
business to the Councell table. But here the same votes passed.<note place="margin">Of the same mind were all the Councell of State.</note> And as the
<hi>number</hi> of Counsellours was greater, so was their <hi>confidence.</hi> Some affirmed
the Cities, when they should hear of that delay,<note place="margin">1560.</note> would publickly claim pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the King, and that the States would take it as an huge affront, when
they suspected the Kings word had failed them: some alleadged the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of the Merchants; Others the pay which the King owed to the Low-countrey
souldiers. Lastly, that their going aboard could not be deferred, was
the opinion of the whole Councel,<note place="margin">But onely <hi>Granvell.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Granvell</hi> excepted, who opposed them
all, either to please the King, or because he thought it would conduce to the
good of the Low-countreys; or because he was unwilling to be without
such a guard, in case his Rivals should conspire against him. But when he
had held out as long as either his authority or elocution could resist;<note place="margin">Who at last consents.</note> at last, he
yeilded to number and weight of reasons. Perhaps he was afraid that any
thing should be carried at the Board without <hi>Granvels</hi> consent. Which made
him vote with the rest, and, as he would have it believed, willingly. The
Governess therefore, moved with the generall suffrage, especially seeing
them dayly grow more odious; which would make their presence a greater
mischeif to the Low-countreys then their absence could be: writes to his
Majesty the Result of that Councell for Remove of the souldiers, slightly
and perfunctorily, as to the Cause, lest she might be thought to fear the
Lords of the Councell, unto whom she read the letters,<note place="margin">The Governesses Express to the King.</note> before the
packet was dispatched away.<note place="margin">Her private letter.</note> But by the same post she wrote to the King,
in cyphers, <hi>That she was not able to retain the</hi> Spaniards <hi>any longer. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
being all resolved, that so long as they saw themselves awed by the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of forrein souldiers, they would not give a penny to the Kings Collectours, by
way of Subsidy. That Bankers and Merchants complained, that the Cities which
had borrowed of them great summes wherewith to pay the</hi> Spaniards <hi>while they
seemed ready to depart; when they saw them demurre upon their voiage, grew an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41239:36"/>
and refused to pay interest for the money. But as there was a generall joy as
soon as they knew the Garrisons were drawn out, and shipping ready for them.
This had quieted the murmurs of the money-Masters, and fed the hopes of the
Low-countrey souldiers, that had fifteen moneths Pay due to them: which they were
promised by the Cities, as soon as ever the</hi> Spaniards <hi>weighed Anchor. But if their
voyage should be put off, and the Low-countreymen see them return from</hi> Zeland;
<hi>she very much feared the souldiers, defrauded of their exspectation, would keep the
high-wayes, and live upon pillage. Nay, that the Cities, through which the</hi> Spaniards
<hi>had lately passed (not without quarrelling and fighting) when they came
back, would shut their gates, and man their works against them. As to the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
of tumults among the</hi> French <hi>upon the borders, they had not yet troubled the
Low-countreys, nor was it greatly to be feared that forreiners would invade them
in the deep of winter. That a more certain mischief impended from the peoples dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
and sedition at home; which if it should rise by their neighbours exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Low-countreys could not be secured by three thousand</hi> Spaniards. <hi>Nor
was there at present so much money in the Treasury, or hope of taking up so much, as
would raise an hundred men for present service.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12. Decemb.</note> Upon receit of these letters,
the King gave a more speedy then willing assent to the desires of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;<note place="margin">The King as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents in these words.</note>
and wrote back to the Governess, <hi>That she might (if she thought good)
send away the</hi> Spanish <hi>souldiers, which would be a seasonable supply in</hi> Africa,
<hi>where so many thousand Christians had been slain in the battel of</hi> Gyrba. <hi>That
their officers should be carefull the souldiers landed not in a body, sending them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
by companies and troops, some to</hi> Naples, <hi>some to</hi> Sicily. <hi>That he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
would look to his ingagements unto the Cities, and take order that the money,
lent by the Merchants, should upon bills of exchange, be returned them in</hi> Spain.
But the wind lying cross, and the winter proving hugely tempestuous, the
<hi>Spanish</hi> souldiers were constrained, for a time, to stay in <hi>Zeland</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
At last,<note place="margin">The Spanish souldiers sail for Spain.</note> the ill weather breaking up, about the beginning of the year, they
weighed Anchors, to the great joy of the Low-countreymen. And because
the King had injoyned the Governess,<note place="margin">1561.</note> that the Infantry of the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
should from thenceforth be no more commanded by the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Lords;<note place="margin">A new Modell of the Foot.</note> under colour of settling the <hi>Militia</hi> when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were
departed, she revived the custome (used in the time that <hi>Mary Queen</hi> of
<hi>Hungary</hi> governed the Low-countreys, but since intermitted) That the
Commanders should be immediately chosen by her self, to make them
more obedient to their Governess. Nor gave she Commissions to Colonels
(which used to be the gift of the Nobility) but signified her pleasure, that
all Captains should receive orders from the Governours of towns, so long as
they quartered within their commands. And she doubted not, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
would be faithfull, because they were placed and displaced by her.
So, for the present, cutting off the Colonells places from the <hi>Militia,</hi> she
conceived she had likewise cut off the authority of mutinous souldiers, and
the power of the Nobility. Nor had it been a vain conception (as some
thought) if she had withall provided,<note place="margin">Touching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick souldiers.</note> in place of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> some new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
out of other Countreys. For although to bring forrein forces into
the Low-countreys, was contrary to the desires of the Estates, and the Kings
Promise; yet the Low-countreymen might have been induced to admit
them, (whilest the sending away of the Spanish was in dispute) if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness
had conditioned, That so long as their neighbours were in arms, so
long the borders should have their Cities (besides their own train-bands)
kept with forrein Garrisons. Certainly they had in generall such a longing
to be rid of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they would have agreed to any terms what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41239:36"/>
and afterwards the Governess might easily have suppressed the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
with those forrein souldiers. But being then ingaged in troubles, the
Dutchess endeavoured to compose them for the present. Unless perhaps
she were deterred from entertaining forrein souldiers, by the emptiness of
the Exchecquer: fearing in that great want of money, if their pay should
fall short, <hi>forreiners</hi> would mutiny more dangerously then the <hi>natives;</hi>
which, from their Princes hand, might divers wayes receive correction.</p>
               <p>The publick joy of the Low-countreymen for the departure of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
was accompanied with private joy at Court,<note place="margin">1562.</note> for <hi>Granvels</hi> being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<hi>Cardinall:</hi> and the solemnity of the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> marriage, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized
in <hi>Saxony,</hi> whither many of the Lords were gone along. For
whilest he was present at the marriage of his sister, he had there concluded
a Match for himself (his first wife <hi>Anne Egmont</hi> being dead) with another
<hi>Anne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Marriage between the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> and Princesse <hi>Anne</hi> daughter to the Duke of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
                  </note> daughter to <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> wherewith he preacquainted
the Governess. Who at first disliking his marrying into a <hi>Lutheran</hi> family,
assured him, it could never be approved of, either by his Majesty or her
self, that he should have a Lady born in a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Court, not onely bred
an heretick by her father long since deceased, but whose zeal would be
dayly inflamed by her fathers brother <hi>Augustus</hi> (who succeeded Duke
<hi>Maurice</hi> in the Electorate) and by her mothers Grandfather <hi>Philip Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
of <hi>Hessen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Landgrave <hi>of</hi> Hessen.</note> But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> perswaded her Excellence he had
taken order for that;<note place="margin">Anno 1550</note> and, by way of prevention had agreed with <hi>Augustus,</hi>
Guardian to the Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> that he would not marry her unless she turned
Catholick; and that <hi>Augustus,</hi> and she her self, under their hands and seals
had Articled as much: though <hi>Philip,</hi> her Grandfather, was against it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
the condition of altering her religion: because he had a design, when
that marriage should be broke off, under colour of Religion, to match his
own daughter to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Landgraves Plot to break the match.</note> To this purpose he had treated with
him by letters, promising for his daughter, that he would accept the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of her renouncing the <hi>Lutheran</hi> faith. So little account they make of
abusing Religion, whose profit is their God.<note place="margin">Discovered to the Duke of <hi>Saxony.</hi>
                  </note> The plot being discovered
and greivously complained of by <hi>Augustus, Philip</hi> replyed, (said the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi>) That he being but poor, and the father of many children, it was
not unhandsome for him, to receive conditions from another: but it would
be a dishonour for the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> a <hi>Prince Elector,</hi> to have <hi>William</hi>
of <hi>Nassau</hi> give the Law to him: and therefore he had refused the condition
for his <hi>Neice,</hi> and accepted it for his <hi>Daughter;</hi> but this answer was not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
to <hi>Augustus,</hi> therefore to prevent him, he resumed the Treaty with
the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> And when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had often profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
That nothing was or could be so dear to him as his soul and honour,
and duty to his Prince; the Governess at last consented. But yet she gave
no leave to the Governours of Provinces to accompany the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>
(which he made his suit) because she had use of their service at home;
the <hi>French</hi> being in arms upon the borders.<note place="margin">1561.</note> Notwithstanding, lest he should
depart discontented, she permitted the rest of the Nobility to go with him.
And in the head of that gallant Troop he rode to <hi>Saxony;</hi> followed by
<hi>Florence Memorancy</hi> Lord of <hi>Montiny,</hi> who, in the name of the <hi>Dutchess</hi> of
<hi>Parma,</hi>

beginning of August, (where the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was present, and divers

renuing his promise to the Governess touching his wives Religion. Which

Promise he as truly performed, as she did the Faith she had sworn to him in

letters from his Holiness,<note place="margin">A Cardinalls hat brought to him.</note> and a <hi>Cardinals hat.</hi> But <hi>Granvel</hi> put off the
receiving of those honours,<note place="margin">He delays his acceptance.</note> till he knew the Kings pleasure. He therefore
dispatched a messenger into <hi>Spain;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25. Feb.</note> I suppose, because he was sensible, that
the Governess had used means to procure him this dignity without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
the King with the contents of her Letters to the <hi>Pope.</hi> Indeed she
had not onely concealed it from his Majesty (who she knew would like well
of it) but from <hi>Granvel</hi> himself. Though it had been long in agitation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her and the <hi>Pope,</hi> as she afterwards wrote to the King.<note place="margin">12. Iuly. 1562.</note> Therefore,
fearing the King would conceive him to be obliged onely to the Dutchess,
<hi>Granvel</hi> would not accept that honour without his Majesties consent, and as
it were from his Royall hand. Perhaps he had some little doubt that the
Dutchess, at one time or other, would take occasion, by reason of that Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
advancement, to remove him from the Civill Government. And
therefore he thought it fit, to wait for the Kings approbation, who, by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
and strict injunction had commended him to the Governess. But
whatsoever he thought, the <hi>Dutchess</hi> liked not his demur upon it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
answered his letter to this purpose,<note place="margin">27. March.</note> 
                  <hi>That she condemned not his resolution,
but her opinion was,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Governess likes not his delay.</note> 
                  <hi>he should have done better to have put on his</hi> Cardinals <hi>Robes
without delay, nor did she doubt, but he would find the King of</hi> Spain <hi>of the same
mind: and that he would receive, with his Majesties Letters, his Command to
force him to it. And though she was very glad the</hi> Popes Nuntio (<hi>as</hi> Granvel
<hi>wrote to her) took it in the best sense: Yet he must have a speciall care, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the</hi> Nuntio, <hi>nor any of his servants, should write to</hi> Rome: <hi>lest the Court
there, should take occasions to cavill at this kind of modesty, or lest the</hi> Pope <hi>should
take offence, as if his gifts should have their estimation from another. In the
mean time she heartily joyed him of his honour, which was joyned with so much
good to Religion and the King; to which ends she had endeavoured it; knowing how
advantagious it would be to the State of the Low-countreys, if things appertaining
to Religion, should be transacted by him, in whom (among other ornaments) his
scarlet would advance his Authority.</hi> Yet notwithstanding these letters from
the Dutchess, <hi>Granvel</hi> assented not, till he had answer out of <hi>Spain;</hi> then he
presently put on his Robes: and so, expressing his duty to the King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distast to the <hi>Governess,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He at last owns the scarlet.</note> he received honour from the one, and favour
from the other.<note place="margin">And hat sent him by speciall favour from his Holiness.</note> Besides his <hi>Pall,</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> Chamberlain, brought him from
<hi>Rome,</hi> a Cardinalls hat, which is seldome sent to any; it being the custome to
receive it onely in <hi>Rome.</hi> Which benefit <hi>Granvel</hi> ascribed to the Dutchess,
with exquisite thanks, <hi>not so much extolling the greatness of the</hi> bounty, <hi>as the</hi>
giver. And he said,<note place="margin">For which he gives the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness his reasons: as she wrote to the King.</note> 
                  <hi>he had cause to reverence it, as the greatest of all honours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
therein he adored the goodness of his Prince.</hi> But in his private discourse,
he plainly told the Dutchess, <hi>That considering the Changes of mans life, he had
accepted of that Dignity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">29. Novem. 1564.</note> 
                  <hi>Especially, for that, if at any time he should leave the
Low-countreys (as he saw a storm over his head, threatening him from the Lords)
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41239:37"/>
he might have a place at</hi> Rome <hi>among the Cardinals, to which he might make an
honourable retreat.</hi> A designe at this day hit upon by many, who knowing,
That Power seldome grows old at Court; and that Favour will as surely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,

               <p>In the year following, 1562,<note place="margin">1562.</note> the Civil War of <hi>France</hi> reviving, the Kings

what before this time was agitated touching these succours, but the whole
Progress of those <hi>French</hi> tumults; forasmuch as partly upon private dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

the Model of the Plot laid by the <hi>Low-countrey men,</hi> with so like success of
both Nations, that sometimes unless you be rectified by the names of Places
and Persons, you would not think you read the actions of two Kingdoms,
but of one and the same People. Moreover, some part of the <hi>French</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
was carried by advice sent out of the <hi>Low-countreys;</hi> whereof Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<hi>Granvel</hi> gave intelligence to his brother, <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Cantonet,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour

               <p>Heresie having long since poysoned <hi>France,</hi> had distracted it into facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

had been infused into her in the family of her husband <hi>Alibret,</hi> whom his
Holiness depreived of the Kingdome of <hi>Navarre</hi>) might lie open to the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> perhaps out of ambition to be thought a <hi>Wit,</hi> which
she affected beyond the limits of her sex; or indeed (as she herself confessed
some years before her death, at which time she was a Catholick) it was not
out of the perversness of her nature; but out of commiseration to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
persons that fled to her protection, which made her so earnest with
her Brother in the defence of their new opinions. So that for ten years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

                  </note>
But <hi>Calvins</hi> stratagem succeeded somewhat better. Who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon the death of <hi>Francis</hi> the first (whilst King <hi>Henry</hi> was engaged
in the Warrs) attempted <hi>France,</hi> by sending Libels from <hi>Geneva.</hi> And as
he found the minds and ears of many possessed with <hi>Luthers</hi> opinions, so he
himself set the common people agogge to understand his new doctrine:<note place="margin">First among the Commons.</note> and
the vulgar was very proud (for his Books were writ to their capacity in the
<hi>French Tongue</hi>) to be made Judges of Religion; and as it were to passe their
votes upon the abstrusest controversies of Faith. Lastly, as they that fall
from the highest point are easily tossed from one breach of the precipice to

the old Religion, they fell headlong from <hi>Luther</hi> to <hi>Calvin;</hi> many of them
not resting, till having disclaimed all worship, and not believing there was
any God at all, they finally stuck fast in the bottomless Abyss of evil. And
notwithstanding that Heresie first corrupted the minds of the People,<note place="margin">Afterwards among the Lords</note> (they
being still the first that are swept away with a Plague) yet in a short space it
made way through the Commons, seized upon some of the greatest Lords,

was very glad for the successe of his design: but yet no lesse solicitous (as

<hi>Almeyda,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. Aprill 1562.</note> because he conceived, upon that answer depended the motions of

would equally conduce to the good of Religion in <hi>France,</hi> whether the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi> was kept from protecting the hereticall party, by a true hope or
a false. And truly by little and little he was so averted from them, that he
was not altogether so kind, as formerly he had been to his wife <hi>Ioan Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret;</hi>

that heresie is not a <hi>sufficient cause</hi> of Divorce; or that King <hi>Philip</hi> would
offer the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> to one he could not choose but fear, because

                  </note> King <hi>Philip</hi> was extraordinarily carefull to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch

perhaps jealous of the Low-countreys, lest the arms or example of the

                  <note place="margin">May 2.</note> and dispatching as many more from Spain by the

presently to choose two thousand horse out of the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Militia,<note place="margin">And commands the Governess to dispatch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Horse out of the Low-countreys.</note> to march against the <hi>French</hi> Rebells; and if the <hi>Queen</hi> or the

sending assistance to the <hi>French.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and Count <hi>Egmont</hi>
argued, that the horse was maintained by the Provinces for a guard to the
Low-countreys, and to that end they were at first ordained. Therefore to
carry them out of the Low-countreys, the Provinces must give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
but that would be a work of time and exposed to much danger; now
especially when the Low-countreys wanted additionall forces, and ought
not to have their own taken from them. But they had perhaps a higher
Consideration.<note place="margin">Perhaps set on by the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
                  </note> For it was believed, at the instigation of the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
some <hi>German</hi> Princes had threatned their neighbours the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen,
if they assisted the <hi>Guises,</hi> enemies to the new Religion, they in
defence of the Cause would bring an armie into the Low-countreys. Nor
do I think it unlikely, that both the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> attempted it, and the
<hi>Germans</hi> undertook it. For on the one part, the Prince of <hi>Condes</hi> faction
was much troubled about the raising of those forces in the Low-countreys;
as appears by a book then published,<note place="margin">1562.</note> and sent by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadour
<hi>Cantonet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">April 4.</note> with letters to his brother <hi>Granvel;</hi> wherein they give the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
many reasons, why the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should not assist the Catholicks
in <hi>France.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iune 30.</note> On the other part, the <hi>Governess</hi> by an Express to his Majestie
informs him, <hi>That the Low-countrey men, either terrified by the</hi> Germans, <hi>or
out of some other cowardly considerations, would hardly, nay could by no means be
drawn; to give order for the horse to march into</hi> France: <hi>and threatned mischief
if they went.</hi> In which letter she seems to touch, what I have here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the cause of their dissent. And she her self (either despairing that the
Provinces would let them go,<note place="margin">The Governess cools in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</note> or believing they could not be well spared
from the Low-countreys, equally endangered by a war from <hi>Germany,</hi> and
an Insurrection at home) pressed the business more remissely at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
Table:<note place="margin">Iuly 1.</note> When on the sudden came an Express from the King, wherein
the <hi>Governess</hi> was not a little chid for her delay;<note place="margin">She is checkt for it by the King.</note> and commanded, without
further consultation, immediately to send away the Horse. She, anxious
how she might obey his Majesty in that particular, by the advice of <hi>Granvel,</hi>
changed the name,<note place="margin">Instead of men she sends money.</note> not substance, of the Kings desires, demanding money
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41239:40"/>
instead of men: Which being granted, she presently returned it into <hi>France</hi>
to the <hi>Queen-wother,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And writes her reasons to the King.</note> and signified to King <hi>Philip</hi> the reason of her so doing,
<hi>Not onely because she knew money would be far welcomer then men to the Queen
(according as she her self formerly intimated, and after the receit confirmed) but
likewise for fear the</hi> Governess <hi>should loose both her endeavours and authority,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August 31.</note> 
                  <hi>in
pressing the Low-countrey men to that, which she found by experience was not to be
obtained; or if it were obtained, would be disadvantageous. That she feared the
Low-countreys now their hearts were down, and that in</hi> Tournay <hi>and</hi> Valencena
<hi>were begun no inconsiderable stirrs about Religion; and no doubt but they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
if the seditious once saw the</hi> Low-countreys <hi>left naked, without defence of
their Horse. Lastly, for that some by their Place were to conduct the Horse, whose
faith she might very well suspect; it seemed to be no less dangerous to trust them
with Arms, then to shew a diffidence in them, by choosing other officers.</hi> The
King <hi>received,</hi> rather then <hi>approved</hi> the condition of the money, which the
States had granted, and sending fifteen hundred horse out of <hi>Spain</hi> to the
<hi>Queen-mother,</hi> which the <hi>Governess</hi> was to pay, he strengthened the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks

<hi>Guise,</hi> and <hi>Momorancy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> enters <hi>Roan</hi> triium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and dies.</note> had taken <hi>Roan</hi> from the Prince of <hi>Condes</hi> men.
The King himself, though dangerously shot, lying upon his bed in a kind of

his wounds bleeding afresh, in the same sepulchre with <hi>himself</hi> he buried
his <hi>hopes</hi> of the Kingdome of <hi>Sardinia;</hi> which he had kept alive till his last
gasp, to the great good of the Catholicks. Nor was the War prosecuted
with lesse care, <hi>Momorancy</hi> commanding in Chief, both Armies exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increasing. For with the Kings forces were joyned 6000 foot sent from
King <hi>Philip,</hi> and the fifteen hundred Horse, formerly mentioned. And

Psalms in <hi>French.</hi> At this Psalm-singing and these night-sermons, tumults
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41239:41"/>
were raised in both Cities, between such as favoured and such as hated
them. The cognizance whereof taken from the Magistrates, was brought
before the Governess; who commanded the Governours of those Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Florence Momorancy</hi> Lord of <hi>Montiny,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Glemè</hi> Marquesse of

after,<note place="margin">Novem. 15. 1561.</note> hanging up <hi>Lanoy</hi> the night-preacher, <hi>Tournay</hi> was quieted. But at
<hi>Valenciens</hi> things fell out far otherwise: For though the Marquess of <hi>Bergen</hi>
presently went thither,<note place="margin">That at <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens</hi> inflamed, by the Hereticks escape of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</note> and by the assistance of <hi>Filibert Brux<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(assigned him for Adjuncts by the Governess) two preaching <hi>Calvinists,
Philip Maillard</hi> and <hi>Simon Favian,</hi> were committed to prison; deferring their

the Marquess of <hi>Bergen</hi> went to <hi>Leige,</hi> to visit his brother Bishop of
that City: For which, being reprehended by the Dutchess, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
back to his Government, he boldly excused himself, That it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
agreeable to his place or nature,<note place="margin">March 22.</note> to put Hereticks to death. Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
answer, she wrote to the King, commending in the letter the industry
of the Lord of <hi>Montiny;</hi> and so comparing the ones deserts with the dis-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the other, made both appear the greater. And indeed, that Heresie
like other contagious diseases, is caught in an instant, and must with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
be prevented, as may be instanced in the examples of <hi>Tournay</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenciens.</hi>
There by the present punishment of a few, all being put in fear:
here, by delay and negligence, the turbulent people having time given to
encourage them. For now that brace of Hereticks (I spake of) had been
in prison seven moneths, and the Magistrates were affraid to proceed to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
because they saw the peoples affection daily increasing towards
them; and divers bills posted up, that threatned mischief to the Judges, if
any harm came to the Prisoners. And many passing by the Jayl in the
night, were heard to chear up the prisoners; and bad them fear nothing: for
if they should be led to execution, the people would rescue them. But the
Dutchess informed of all this, taxed the Magistrates with the fear they had
brought upon themselves, by seven moneths delay; and seriously fore-warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, not to make the disease incurable, by further delaying. Therefore
according to the <hi>Emperours</hi> Edict,<note place="margin">Which at last are condemned.</note> sentence was pronounced, and the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
condemned to be burned. But because some tradesmen were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
especially the Clothiers, the execution was put off to a day, when
they alwayes used to be absent from <hi>Valenciens;</hi> their custome being on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday
night, to walk abroad into the fields, and not to come back to
town till Monday morning. Part going a feasting to the Villages near hand,
with their parents and their wives; part getting out of the way, lest they
should be observed not to be at Church with the Catholicks. On Monday
therefore by day-break, the condemned persons were brought into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place.
Yet it was not so privately carried, but multitudes of people fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed:
And <hi>Favean,</hi> when he came near the faggots, cried out as loud as
ever he could gape,<note place="margin">But rescued by the Commons.</note> 
                  <hi>O Eternall Father:</hi> At which words the whole Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place
made a hideous noise, and suddenly strove to fetch off the prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
casting stones at the Officers, withall breaking into the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41239:41"/>
they seized upon all the instruments of death; threw about the fagots,
and for very madnesse,<note place="margin">And by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate carryed back to prison.</note> broke them into little pieces. Till the officers, too
weak for the multitude, were forced to carry the prisoners back to the Jayl,
and to run for it themselves, the stones flew so fast about their ears. Having
freed their companions, by degrees the peoples fury cooled; or rather, not
knowing what to do for want of a Leader, they met all in a peaceable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
that you would have rather thought them Petitioners, then Mutineers,

                     <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes turned into <hi>French</hi> meeter.</note> they blamed their own sloath, and resolved to take their opportunity
while the Citie was in fear and trembling. Before I proceed, because the
singing of Psalmes hath casually been <hi>twice,</hi> and must be <hi>oftner</hi> mentioned,
I conceive it will not be amisse for the Reader to understand the Originall

                  </note> there
was one <hi>Clement Marot,</hi> born at <hi>Davean;</hi> a man naturally eloquent, of a
voluble fluent tongue, having a rare vein in <hi>French</hi> poetry, wherewith the
King was much taken,<note place="margin">

pleasures.</hi> But (as his wit was somewhat better, then his conditions) by his
acquaintance with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> he was suspected to have changed his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
and therefore fearing the King would be offended, he fled to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
sister at <hi>Bearn,</hi> the old Sanctuary for Delinquents. A while after, the
King was pacified, and he returned to <hi>Paris.</hi> Where he was advised by his
friend <hi>Francis Vatable,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew Lecturer,</hi> to leave the trifling subjects he
wrote upon, and study divine Poesie.<note place="margin">His Translation of the Psalter.</note> Hereupon, he began to translate the
Psalmes of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Prophet into <hi>French</hi> stanza's, but so ignorantly and
perversely, (as a man altogether unlearned) that the King (though he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
sung his verses,<note place="margin">Forbid by his Majesty.</note> yet upon the just complaints of the <hi>Sorban</hi> Doctours
and their severe censure passed against them) commanded that nothing of
<hi>Maro's,</hi> in that kind, should be from thenceforth published. But being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
by Proclamation, as it often happens, the longing of the Reader and
fame of the Work was increased: so that new tunes were set to <hi>Marot's</hi>
thimes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marot</hi> flies his Countrey.</note> and they were sung like profane ballads. He, in the mean time,
growing bold by the peoples applauses, and not able to forbear bragging:
for fear of punishment ran to <hi>Geneva.</hi> And flying from thence, for new
crimes committed, but first having been well whipped for them, he died at
<hi>Austune.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dyes.</note> The successe of this Translation of Psalmes, moved <hi>Theodor Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>

too; so the whole book of Davids Psalmes was finished. And to make it
pleasing to the people, they had severall tunes set to them by excellent
Composers, that chimed so sweetly, as every one desired to have the new
Psalter. But many errours in it being detected against Religion,<note place="margin">It is published but prohibited immediately by the Catholicks. Retained by the hereticks.</note> and the
Work therefore prohibited, as well because the sacred verses of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

were, <hi>dolo malo,</hi> bound up with <hi>Calvin's</hi> Catechisme at <hi>Geneva:</hi> these sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Psalmes, though abhorred and sleighted by the Catholicks, remained in
high esteem with hereticks: and the custome of singing <hi>Geneva</hi> Psalmes in
<hi>French,</hi> at publick meetings, upon the high way, and in shops, was thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
taken for the distinctive sign of a Sectary.</p>
               <p>The seditious Townsmen of <hi>Valenciens</hi> warbling in this manner (as I was
about to have told you) passed along the streets,<note place="margin">The <hi>Valence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Sedition renued.</note> as if they meant to deliver
a Petition. But making a stand in the market-place, they lifted up their sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Master,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41239:42"/>
and bad him preach <hi>ex tempore.</hi> Immediately, either by the
Preachers perswasion, or the increase of their company, the mutinie was
revived: and finding themselves grown strong (for they were about two
thousand) they would not part, without doing something worthy such a
Muster. Wherefore they resoved to pull down and burn a monastery of
<hi>Dominicans.</hi> But changing their minds upon the way (for they were tossed
and tumbled like billows in a storm) a fury possessed them, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered

                  <hi>To what end had they raised this tumult, and

which they had escaped in the market-place? no, they would look into the matter,

forced the doors, knocked off their shackles; and that they might appear to
do nothing out of contempt of Law, they onely set those two at liberty,
and kept in the rest that were committed for other causes; sending word to
the Magistrates, they had onely met to deliver their brethren, but if they
might live quietly, and not be troubled for their conscience, not a man
among them would stirre any more. In the mean time, <hi>Michael Hovey,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty-governour

returned, at discretion quiet the troubles, if any yet remained. She
commands him likewise to signifie to the <hi>Marquesse,</hi> in what condition <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenciens</hi>

private business.<note place="margin">Souldiers are brought into the Town by the Governesses Order.</note> But now the <hi>Marquesses</hi> Lieutenant (the Low-countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

of <hi>Bergen</hi> himself, and the Count of <hi>Bosch</hi> came into the town: and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their exspectations, found all quiet, not so much as any signe of a
Sedition. But <hi>Indeveltius,</hi> who was in Commission with the <hi>Marquesse</hi> to
examine business of that nature, being sent by the Magistrate to the
Dutchess for authority to pursue the fugitives, was earnest with her, to
take from that turbulent Citie both their priviledges and arms; and that,
with the fines payed by the Mutiners for their composition, a fort should be
built to hold in the stiff-necked people like a bridle; &amp; the <hi>Valencenian;</hi> might
be compelled to this, if her Excellence would but send one thousand two
hundred foot,<note place="margin">A Councell is called about pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the city.</note> to the horse already in town. The Governess caused it to be
moved at the Councell table; where the gentler vote carried it, That the
fugitives should be brought back to execution, and the authours of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
punished: but that the rage of the mad people should not ruine the
honest Citizens.<note place="margin">The milder opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion carries it.</note> The Governess consented, the rather; because that Citie
(as she wrote to the King) standing much affected to the <hi>French,</hi> must have
been unseasonably provoked, whilst the <hi>French</hi> were in arms within sight
of the town. But she her self forbare, as much as was possible, to make any
Levies: lest the sword, and consequently the power should come into the
hands of some of the Low-countrey Lords. Yet, because nothing could be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41239:42"/>
done in that City without souldiers,<note place="margin">New souldiers put into the Town.</note> she commands the <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
to draw souldiers out of his severall Garrisons, not above thirty out of
any one; and so on the sudden, to put two hundred into <hi>Valenciens,</hi> giving
it out, that company after company should follow them, to aw the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the Judgement, pronounced against the offenders might accordingly
be executed.<note place="margin">The seditious executed.</note> The <hi>Marquess</hi> readily obeyed: And though the two sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preachers were then escaped, a while after one of them was taken,
and put to death; and the Citie, terrified with the decrees of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and the continuall fresh supplies of souldiers; within a few dayes,
having taken the fiercest of the Mutineers (or those that bragged most of
their doings in the tumult) they were severely punished.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Valenciens</hi> quieted.</note> So for that time
the mutiny at <hi>Valenciens</hi> ceased.<note place="margin">The Governesses vigilancy.</note> The <hi>Governess</hi> was not more glad of the

were crept into one Citie; especially, because in other places, she saw
the like beginnings and motions, she was jealous lest <hi>Calvinisme,</hi> which

               <p>This seconded by <hi>Granvels</hi> advice,<note place="margin">New Bishops brought in.</note> moved the Governess to bring in the
designed Bishops into their several Dioceses, that by example, word, and
deed (which most conduces to the advancement of Religion) they might
be a stay and support to the people committed to their charge. Indeed
things were put into a handsome way; and by the industry of <hi>Granvel,</hi> and
the <hi>Nuncio</hi> (the one having the <hi>Popes</hi> Commission to this purpose, and the

that the goods of the Monasteries might not be given away to Bishops,

the King to ordain any Bishop, that should not be maintained out of his

<hi>by his letters had further moved the King to invade the Low-countreys with a

                  <hi>To which words of</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamont
<hi>she had answered: That the Lords were not kept from the knowledged of

but a young man were approved of by</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth and King</hi> Philip) <hi>so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
a Statesman, that now in his old age and experience the King might not
imploy him: or of so rash a malice, that he would offer to perswade his Majesty to
take away their lives which he knew were dear unto the King, and might be sure
she would oppose him in it. Nor did that seem lesse improbable and ridiculous
which was said of his advising his Majesty, for would any man make war upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41239:45"/>
and with vast expence to purchase what already is his own? Lastly for the
Bishops,</hi> Granvel <hi>indeed sought to bring them in, as the King had injoyned him,
in pursuance of the</hi> Popes <hi>command, not to make way for the Inquisition, but to
protect Religion in a troublesome time. The charge whereof (as of all things else,
which conduced to the maintenance of the Kings prerogative) because</hi> Granvel
<hi>fearlessely undertook, despising all mens murmurs, he was therefore hated ly many;
as they should ever be that stoutly defend the authority of their Prince.</hi> With
these discoveries the Governess pre-acquainted the King, and desired him
in a little note by it self, that he would use the service of some one of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
trust in the decyphering of her letter.<note place="margin">The faith and freedome of Count <hi>Barla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>
                  </note> Though <hi>Barlamont</hi> himself, as he
was open hearted, and thought, that in this relation to the Governess he had
both served his King and Countrey; being asked by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
who took notice of his long stay with the Governess, whether he had told
her what private conference they had among themselves: he ingeniously
repeated his whole discourse with the Governess: Nor did the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> seem to take it amisse; I suppose, because he saw the grievances of
his own framing, were proposed in the name of a generality, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be imputed to him alone, but would receive authority from
the multitude.<note place="margin">27. Iuly.</note> In the interim, the King adviseth the Governess, by no

Spies upon the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his Counsells, she should still have
him at Court and in her eye. And to set Count <hi>Egmont</hi> and the Prince of

them.<note place="margin">What disparity betwixt Count <hi>Egmont</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  </note> Count <hi>Egmont</hi> was of a sweet disposition, free of speech, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:

and his Munificence (about the sending whereof at that time to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Provinces, he had before consulted with her) should not
be distributed to all, but come onely to the hands of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
and Count <hi>Egmont;</hi> and the Count should have more then the Prince, that
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> might suspect him for his Rivall in his Majesties fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:
and the rest of the Lords, because they were passed by, somewhat
resent it in them both. This plot went on, and their ill-pieced conspiracie
began to crack a sunder: the Governess still having her irons in the fire.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41239:45"/>
And to this purpose, at the generall <hi>Dyet</hi> (or convention) of the Estates of
<hi>Germany</hi> summoned by the <hi>Emperour Ferdinand</hi> at <hi>Franckford</hi> to create a
King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> some of the Low-countrey Lords being to go thither
in the name of King <hi>Philip;</hi> whilst all the Nobility were in exspectation of
the imployment, the Dutchess made choice of <hi>Philip Croy</hi> Duke of <hi>Arescot;</hi>
not because he was bred up in <hi>Germany</hi> with <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth (as she decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her self at the Consult) and therefore was likely to be well received by
his brother <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> But because he was an enemie to the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>
his faction, she honoured him with that Embassage, that others might
follow his example on like hopes of honour. Yet the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to be present at the <hi>Dyet,</hi> as a private man, pretending business with
the Elector of <hi>Saxonie</hi> about his wifes portion, and with the Emperour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Estate. And though the Governess would not, without the

would not tarry till his wife was brought a bed.<note place="margin">The Princesse of <hi>Orange</hi> brought a bed of a Daughter. Montinys Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage out of the Kings letter to the Governess</note> Who three dayes after was

                  <hi>Montiny</hi> having twice had audience of his Majestie, prepared for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and when he took leave, the King, whilst he commended to his care
the state of the Low-countreys, as it were upon occasion of discourse, began
to fift him, and charged him by his faith and sinceritie,<note place="margin">23 Novem.</note> virtues he had found
in him, to deal plainly,<note place="margin">His Conference with the King. He imputes the generall discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the new Bishops and <hi>Granvel.</hi>
                  </note> what he thought was the cause of those Grievances
and Heart-burnings of so many in the Low-countreys. <hi>Montiny</hi> though he
said he knew nothing, whereof his Majesty had not been long since inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet as farre as he could conjecture, the reasons partly proceeded from
the new Bishops put upon the Provinces without the consent or privity of
their Governours, &amp; therefore the people believed they intended to bring in
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition: partly out of the hatred conceived against Cardinall
<hi>Granvel</hi> from the highest to the lowest, so implacably, that it was to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that at one time or other it would ingage the people in an insurrection.
The King replyed, that all this was indeed known to him,<note place="margin">The King gives his reasons for increase of the Bishops.</note> but that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
the Low-countreymen could be moved with such vain rumours. For
seriously no other cause brought him to augment the number of the Bishops,
but onely the necessity of his people, and the Councell of his father <hi>Charles</hi>
the fifth. And that was not concluded so secretly or suddenly, as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
of <hi>Bergen</hi> could tell him, who had given his advice therein, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
his design when he waited on the King into <hi>England,</hi> at his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with <hi>Queen Mary.</hi> And that for his own part, it never entered into
his mind, by that adjunction of Bishops to impose the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition
upon the Low-countreys; Nor had Cardinall <hi>Granvel</hi> ever perswaded him
to do it, or was so much as acquainted with that purpose of his Majesty till
he sent <hi>Francis Sonnius</hi> his Embassadour to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Desends Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</note> He likewise assured him,
they were much deceived that hated the <hi>Cardinall</hi> as conceiving him, by
private information, to asperse the Lords, for he did never attempt it,<note place="margin">Possesses <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny</hi> with his Resolution to go in person to the Low-countreys. <hi>Montinies</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in Senate</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had his Majestie himself at any time discovered in <hi>Granvel</hi> any malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
inclinations: which if he should hereafter find in him, or any other of
his ministers of State, he never should indure them. But, howsoever, he
hoped shortly to be in the Low-countreys, and then to satisfie both his own
person, and the Provinces desires. <hi>Montiny</hi> thus dismissed by the King, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Bruxels</hi> in December;<note place="margin">14 Day of Decemb.</note> and reading to the Councel his letters
which contained the Kings pleasure for settling the intricacies of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checquer

                  <note place="margin">Which they cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit not.</note> and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41239:46"/>
specially for defence of Religion; he added, of himself,<note place="margin">1562.</note> many arguments of
the Kings affection towards the Low-countreys; but to little purpose. For in
<hi>Montinies</hi> absence, they had conceived still greater jealousies. The Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> and some others, reasoned against the promises made by the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour,
for they rather trusted their own reall, or (to justifie their discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents)
pretended intelligence from their private friends in the Court of
<hi>Spain,</hi> then the professions made either by King <hi>Philip,</hi> or his sister. Their
indignation was augmented, because <hi>Montiny</hi> told them the <hi>French</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
them Patrons of the <hi>Hugonots.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Lords of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at <hi>Granvel</hi> upon new suspitions.</note> About which scandall they passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately

opinion, and shewed them, it was rather invented by the <hi>French</hi> hereticks
and rebells, who to advance the authority of their faction, would have the
ignorant believe the Low-countrey Nobility were of the same sect. To
conclude,<note place="margin">He despiseth his enemies.</note> they being more and more exasperated, because the Governess
would not displace their Competitour, that feared not their plots or envie,
but proposing to himself onely the Kings favour, respected this <hi>Iove</hi> alone
despising the other petty Gods; (as if a man could be onely struck with a

because the Governess had formerly scattered among them seeds of dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
perhaps, some of the Lords therefore differed in opinion, because they
were not chief of the Conspiracy. Indeed the Duke of <hi>Areschot,</hi> pressed
by Count <hi>Egmont</hi> as they were hunting, to joyn with the rest, denied to set
his hand against the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> or to prescribe the King how he ought to use
his servants; and it proceeded so farre, that at last the Duke concluded, he
would receive the Law neither from Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> nor the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
to neither of which he thought himself or his family inferiour. The
Counts of <hi>Aremberg</hi> and <hi>Barlamont</hi> then present were much troubled at the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sir, We are infinitely sorry
that we are at this present inforced to presse upon your Majesties great affairs; but
as well the account of our service which we ought to give, as the mischief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
impending, will not suffer us longer to be silent: especially because we hope
this our intimation, as free from any passion, will be received by your Majesty so
graciously, and with such remembrance of us, as we your affectionate servants
have indeavoured to deserve. We likewise beseech your Majesties pardon, if we
write later, then the exigence requires. When the greatest and wisest men consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Government of the Low-countreys, questionlesse they cannot but hink it
absolutely managed by Cardinall</hi> Granvel; <hi>which hath made so deep an impression
in the hearts of the Low-countreymen, that it cannot be hoped the opinion will
be blotted out, so long as he lives among them. Therefore we humbly desire, that,
for our fidelity which, Sir, you have ever acknowledged (to speak nothing of our
services) you will not be displeased to take into consideration, how much it concerns
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41239:46"/>
your Majesty to ease the common complaints and grievances of your people.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1562.</note> 
                        <hi>For
again and again we beseech you to believe, that the businesse of the Low-countreys
will never have an happy end, so long as it is ordered by the man they hate. Nor
should we presume to write thus much, unlesse we had the mischief in our eyes, to
which if your Majesty apply not present remedy, the whole state will certainly be
indangered. Wherein, if ever your Majesty gave credence to our words or actions,
we beseech you now to credit our hands. This indeed was the cause why so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Lords and Governours of these Provinces, with a multitude of others
desired to have it signified to your Majesty, that our imminent destruction may be
timously prevented: and your Majesty will prevent it, as we hope; and the merits
of so many Low-countrey men, and their prayers for the safety of the publick, will
be more valued by your Majesty, then that for one mans sake, you will reject the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of so many of your Majesties obedient subjects. Especially since none of all
this number, but is so far from complaining of the</hi> Governess, <hi>that we give your
Majesty immortall thanks for so prudent a Princess. And that your Maiesty
may not think, as some perhaps will suggest, that we have plotted this out of an
ambition that we our selves may govern, we all of us earnestly intreat to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Councel-table, and affairs of State: it being neither consistent with
your Maiesties interest, nor our own reputation, that we should come any more to
Councel with the</hi> Cardinal. <hi>But touching Religion, which is now a thing of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Concernment, we promise in our own names, all that can be justly exspected from
good Subjects and Catholicks, such as we professe to be. And truly if the Lords
had not looked into it, Religion had not been in that tolerable condition wherein now
it is: the minds of the Common people being infected with Heresie, a disease hardly
curable by the</hi> Cardinals <hi>authority or example. Lastly, that we may no longer tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
upon your Majesties weighty occasions, we humbly beg you will please favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to interpret what we have signified, no less out of duty and alleagiance to your
Majesty, then out of fear that hereafter you might blame us, if any misfortune
should befall the Low-countreys. Thus we humbly kiss your royall hands, and pray
God long to preserve and blesse your Majestie From your City of</hi> Bruxels, <hi>the last
of March,</hi> 1563.</p>

               <p>These Letters thus signed by the <hi>Triumviri,</hi> Count <hi>Egmont</hi> secretly sent
into <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Charles Tisnac</hi> a Low-countrey man, and the Kigns Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
in <hi>Spain,</hi> for business of the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of these letters the Governess preadvertised the King.</note> But before the Dispatch
was made, the <hi>Governess</hi> understanding what they had writ, pre-acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King. Nor was the intelligence she gave concealed from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiratours,
Count <hi>Egmont</hi> charging the discovery upon Count <hi>Aremberg,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">March 9.</note> as
if he were fallen off;<note place="margin">How the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness came by her intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, causes a grievous falling out between <hi>Egmont</hi> and <hi>Aremberg.</hi>
                  </note> especially because there was difference between him
and the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> But he seriously denied, that ever he had spoke
of it to any man living; nor needed their project a discoverer, which they
themselves in every place vain-gloriously divulged. Yet Count <hi>Egmont</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
upon it, replied, That a friend of his had assured him, it could not be
revealed by any but himself. <hi>Aremberg</hi> growing into a rage, <hi>And I</hi> (said
he) <hi>assure you, he lyes who ere he be, that fathers this upon me; which I am ready
to make good with my sword.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">May 5.</note> The <hi>Governess</hi> writing this passage to the King,
forgot not to complain of Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> that he whom his Majesty had
accounted faithfull above the rest, could so far ingage against him, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to solicite and encourage others to joyn their minds and endeavours
for their Countreys benefit and liberty. And now after three moneths, the
Kings Letters came from <hi>Spain,</hi> written by the hand of <hi>Charles Tisnac,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:41239:47"/>
wherein his Majestie answered the demands of the <hi>Triumviri,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters sent from the three Lords, inviting one of them to <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<hi>That he had received their Letters, and doubted not but that they signified
these things out of sincere affection to their Prince and Countrey. For they had
given many sufficient proofs of their fidelity and service. But since they had not
yet given particular reasons for</hi> Granvels <hi>removall, and that it was not his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
to change any of his Ministers of State, without proof against them: He
should therefore take it well, if some one of them would come over to</hi> Spain, <hi>and
make him understand the matter;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1563.</note> 
                  <hi>for by how much they affirmed there needed the

                  <note place="margin">Iune 15.</note>
Besides these Letters,<note place="margin">A private letter from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie to Count <hi>Egmont.</hi>
                  </note> the King wrote privately with his own hand to
Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> that he should be glad to hear from the Count himself, the
causes that were not inserted in their Letters. His Majesty likewise acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Governess</hi> what answer in common he makes to all three, and what
particularly to <hi>Egmont;</hi> that he invites one of them to divide them, and
wishes it might be <hi>Egmont,</hi> because he, separated from the rest, might be easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrought upon, new moulded, and so brought again to himself, and his
right reason.<note place="margin">But none of the three would go.</note> But neither Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> nor any of the rest could be
brought to go the journey; perhaps thinking it below them, to undertake so
great a voyage to accuse <hi>Granvell:</hi> perhaps their guilty consciences durst not
trust themselves in <hi>Spain.</hi> Yet in their answers to the King, they laid the
cause of their stay upon their neighbours the <hi>French,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For which they give reasons to his Majestie.</note> who having souffled
up a kind of <hi>Peace</hi> at home, it concerned them to watch whether they would
use their Arms abroad: and while the people continued in that Jealousie and
fear; they held it impious to leave their Countrey, to inform against any
man. Notwithstanding, if the King pleased to send for them upon other
terms, they would immediately obey his Maiesties commands. In the mean
time, they would forbear the Councel-board, lest they should meet there
to countenance <hi>Granvels</hi> Actions. In all things else, they would never be
wanting to their Prince and Countrey. The like auswer was made particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
by Count <hi>Egmont;</hi> who likewise humbly thanked his Maiesty for his
speciall grace and favour to him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Granvel</hi> grows out of date at Court.</note> Whilst this was in agitation, <hi>Granvell</hi>
tottered at Court: For 'tis hard to stand long in a slippery place, if a man
be iustled by many; specially when a Prince is made jealous, as if his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
derivative power detracted from his own ability to govern. Nor have
the old Court-Engineers many better inventions to crush the favour of
their Rivals; especially with such Princes, as are ambitious to be famed for
wit, whether deserving or undeserving. With this very stratagem, a few
years after, <hi>Didacus Cardinall Spinosa,</hi> no lesse endeared to the King in <hi>Spain,</hi>
then Cardinall <hi>Granvell</hi> to his Majesties sister in the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> was cast
down (they say) from the highest point of favour,<note place="margin">Aloyfio Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera lib. 9. in the life of King Philip.</note> by such as knew the
King loved his Ministers of State, so long as they carried themselves as <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
and not as <hi>authours</hi> of his Counsells. And now the <hi>Governess</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be altered in affection towards <hi>Granvell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Governess displeased with him, for three reasons.</note> perhaps weary of the man, as
if he were her adjunct in the Government, if not her superintendent: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
seeing her self in danger of being infected with the peoples hatred,
which he was incurably sick of: perhaps, at length she had looked into him,
and found him ambitious and envious, fomenting the divisions between the
King and his people, as she afterwards enformed his Majesty.<note place="margin">August 29.</note> Which last
reason, being contrary to the commendations she had so often set upon
<hi>Granvell</hi> in her letters to the King, whether it were true, and discovered by
the <hi>Governess</hi> upon long acquaintance: or that she knew it at first; but then,
as she concealed it in favour of the man: so now weary of him, and fearfull of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41239:47"/>
imminent mischief, she revealed it: or whether mis-informed, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by his enemies, she wrote thus to the King, I dare not absolutely affirm.

                  <note place="margin">On the 25.</note> after many complaints made in the
name of the Estates, touching the present condition of affairs, the appears
so long due to the horse and foot, the Kings Collectors undone with pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
interest, and the complaints of the Merchants thereupon; concluded,
that since all this proceeded from the dominion of the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
they were resolved henceforth to come no more to Councel, not for
any exceptions taken at the <hi>Governess,</hi> whose wisdome and affection to the
<hi>Low-countreys</hi> they would alwayes gratefully remember; but lest they
should contribute to those Acts passed, with so much prejudice to the King
and the Low-countreys. Moreover, (which <hi>Egmont</hi> added) lest by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Councel-table, and yet not providing for the necessities of
their Countrey, they should loose the Peoples affection, together with
their own reputation, and consequently the Opportunity of doing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
service. Nor would this seem strange, if the King pleased to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that long since, when <hi>Charles</hi> Count <hi>Lalin</hi> was President of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
<hi>Granvell</hi> being then Bishop of <hi>Arras,</hi> refused to come to the Board,
offended at the Counts Potencie. Then he should tell his Majesty, that
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Marquess of <hi>Bergen,</hi> bitterly inveighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Granvell,</hi> and the Arts he had used to make the King believe, they
juggled with Religion and their Prince. Nay, they very well knew, that
<hi>Telidan</hi> a Divine of <hi>Lovain</hi> (as he himself boasted) wrote to the King. That
the <hi>Low-countrey</hi> Lords were all tainted with Heresie; and that the very
same occasion of enmity, which the <hi>French</hi> Hereticks took against the
Cardinall of <hi>Lorain,</hi> was now revived by the Nobilitie of the <hi>Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</hi>
And that another day, the <hi>Governess</hi> taking <hi>Egmont</hi> aside, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the same grievances, wondering the King would suffer the <hi>Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys</hi>
to be troubled for one man, who was not so much as a <hi>Low-countrey
man;</hi> and therefore both his fortunes and affections were <hi>forreiners:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had he taken the Oath of Allegeance to the King; but partly to the
<hi>Emperour,</hi> as born in an Imperiall Town: and partly to the <hi>Pope,</hi> from
whom he had received his scarlet. When <hi>Armenterius</hi> should have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
this to the King, he was then to acquaint his Majesty, what the
<hi>Governess</hi> answered to the particulars, according to his Notes containing
the summary of his Embassage.<note place="margin">Of <hi>Granvells</hi> danger.</note> Lastly, she charged him, upon the same
heads, to be sure to remember, That <hi>Egmont</hi> had lately told her, it was by
his onely means, that <hi>Granvell</hi> lived to that day; but that hereafter he
would leave that care to the <hi>Governess,</hi> whom he had now clearly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> life was every houre in danger: and therefore when
his Majestie should well consider, what Insurrections such publick crimes
draw along with them, he would in his wisdome resolve how to dispose of
<hi>Cardinall Granvell.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">A report raised that King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</note> and immediately dispersed through

                  <note place="margin">Which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was active to suppresse.</note> That King <hi>Philip</hi> was pistolled.
This report he was so farre from sleighting (though
otherwise subject to delays) that he laid it, before it
could passe out of <hi>Spain;</hi> sending Duplicates of letters
post both by sea and land, into the Low-countreys:
wherein, under his own hand, he certified his sister,<note place="margin">4. Ianuary.</note> that in all probability
this fame was forged by the hereticks, upon some close design set afoot by
that treacherous kind of people. Withall he commanded her, that if she did
but hear the least intimation of such a report, she should presently dispatch
letters through the Low-countreys, and so into <hi>France, Britain,</hi> and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
to rectifie the errour; not onely that his uncle the Emperour, and his
cousen-germane the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> might be freed of their fears: but
likewise the insurrections prevented, for encouraging whereof these reports,
whether true or false, did equally prevail with men desirous of innovation.
But the Governess having certain intelligence, that he news was no where
divulged in those parts, would not mention it at all: lest she might ingraft
the opinion she indeavoured to eradicate. Especially when she had business
at home of greater concernment; the Nobility being discontented, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Libells read upon every post, or passed from hand to hand;<note place="margin">Scandalous Pamphlets post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and handed through the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</note> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy

so invite them by impunity, or punish them; for neither way can extinguish
the memory of what is done, nor deterre abusive writers from the like bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And King <hi>Philip</hi> grown now more severe,<note place="margin">15. Iuly 1561.</note> since the tumult at <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens</hi>
from whence that liberty chiefly took its rise, injoyned the Governess
not to suffer such ignominious verses, that commonly ushered in rebellion.
But she quickly gave over her inquiry,<note place="margin">10. August. 1562.</note> fearing to take knowledge of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,

worn by their servants, especially by their footmen; but that they
would all give one Livery; and so it should not be thought the invention of
any particular person that desired to save charges. And by the uniformity
of their apparell,<note place="margin">They throw the Dice who shall name the Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> it would appear their minds were uniform. Some therefore
proposing what colour would do best, they cast the dice who should chuse,
and the lot fell to Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> who made choice of black cloth-coats
with long sleeves,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Egmont</hi> chuses</note> such as I told you were called silken wings: in which were
imbroidered the heads of men and hoods of divers colours such as fools and
jeasters wear upon their coats. A pattern of these wings, that nothing might
be concealed from the King,<note place="margin">29. Of March.</note> the Governess sent him. And now imbroider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and taylours shops were full of these Coats and Cognizances, and the
people looked and talked high upon the matter:<note place="margin">How the People interpret the Device.</note> nor are they alwayes out
in their conjectures. For some said the hoods signified the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> who
according to the habit of his illustrious, Order wore such an hood falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his shoulders; and the heads, they guessed to be the <hi>Cardinals</hi> and his
adherents, among whom they numbered the Duke of <hi>Areschot,</hi> Count <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamont,</hi>
and <hi>Viglius</hi> President of the Councell; and they interpreted the
fools coats to signifie, that the Low-countrey Lords were not fools heads,
as <hi>Granvel</hi> once called them, but that <hi>Granvel</hi> himself and his party might
be pointed at for idiots. Others rather thought those heads and fools-hoods
were brought in fashion by the Lords, as if they were contented to be called
fools: but yet they would have the <hi>Cardinall</hi> understand how <hi>

the fools were: and to beware, least in that number there might be a <hi>Brutus.</hi>
But the Governess, though she made a better construction of these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems,
yet feared that the people, which she saw begin to grow discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and mutinous, should divide into factions and raise tumults: he was
therefore very earnest with Count <hi>Egmont</hi> and the other Lords, to give off
their design,<note place="margin">The Governess gets them to leave off part of it.</note> and lay aside the new incouragements to insurrection. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a great sort of the coats, and above two thousand of the wings were
already made:<note place="margin">Which the Lords supply with another Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme.</note> her Excellence thought it would be well, if she could get
them to leave out the heads and hoods, the principall matter of offence;
which with much ado they did; and instead of the old, Count <hi>Egmont</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
another Embleme,<note place="margin">As the King answered <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in his Apollogy 1481.</note>

with <hi>hoods,</hi> but <hi>arrows,</hi> and those tied together in a bundle, and therefore
not easie to be broken. Nor did the Governess take notice of the alteration,
hoping to cure the evil by contempt, and having often found by experience,

Yet because his Majesty knew that, especially in the Low-countreys, the
power of forreiners would not be long indured; and that he had an
eye upon the example of the <hi>French</hi> Court: and thought it best to do that,
while his authoritie was intire, which perhaps necessity might unhandsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

whether he should bring a man to Court, that was not unpractised in Court-designes,
and might happily precede him in the Kings favour (for no virtue

the Duke solicited for <hi>Cardinall Granvels</hi> coming into <hi>Spain.</hi> For the King
had been lately perswaded by <hi>Armenterius,</hi> that it would be greatly to his
prejudice, to have the <hi>Cardinall</hi> in his Court: who out of his hatred to the
Low-countreys would be suspected, in all their affairs to corrupt the Kings
commands,<note place="margin">For <hi>Granvel</hi> is commanded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
                  </note> which would be thought to be the Cardinals pleasure. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
therefore would rather have him retire into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and to live not
far from the Low-countreys, where He hoped in time to settle him again.
<hi>Granvel</hi> was the more willing to go thither, because he had the fair pretence
of doing his duty at <hi>Besonçon</hi> to his mother now old and diseased: in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

upon letters from the King commanding them to fit again in Councel,<note place="margin">6 of March.</note> and
more to regard the authority of their Prince, then their own hatred to any
private man, waited again at Court, to the joy of all degrees and qualities.
Save that it took off a little from the generall contentment,<note place="margin">Which report spoiled the mirth of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. And troubled the Governesse.</note> that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
the Cardinall would come back; though many thought it an idle
rumour, invented by the man himself, who (as they said) was proud in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
and would not stoop, but even as he <hi>fled</hi> still <hi>threatned.</hi> But others
were not of that opinion, especially the Governess, that knew with how
much difficulty and reluctation the King had called him away.<note place="margin">29. of March.</note> By her let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
therefore she acquainted his Majesty, That <hi>Egmont</hi> concealing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours

set foot again within the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> was to be murthered the same day.
The Low-countrey writers, out of uncertain reports name one <hi>Villet,</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman
of <hi>Granvels</hi> that undertook to kill him. And the Counts <hi>Egmont</hi>
and <hi>Horn</hi> were charged, as privy to <hi>Villets</hi> intention, at their Triall in the
year 1568. Besides in the private intelligence, which a Lady of quality from
the Borders sent into the Low-countreys, I find this design against the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
mentioned; unles perhaps all this was feigned, to fright the Governess.</p>

that spake of his return into the <hi>Low-countreys;</hi> and by increase of the faction
of the <hi>Cardinalists</hi> (for so they called the Duke of <hi>Areschot,</hi> Count <hi>Barla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>

and much of their new joy and alacrity abated. For on the one
part diverse of the Lords said, They feared, (unlesse they pretended fear, to
colour their private meetings) that if they should, removing all Obstructions,
dispose things to a good conclusion, <hi>Granvell</hi> upon a sudden would return,
and boldly claim a share in the success: On the other part, the <hi>Cardinalists</hi>
more slowly followed the Kings business; either offended at the <hi>Governess,</hi>

for.<note place="margin">That they may have no more such frights, the Governess moves the King.</note> But the <hi>Governess</hi> persisted in her desires to bar all hope of his return,

<hi>Granvell</hi> knew he had to do with a Prince, enamoured of his merits, whose

pretend to be carefull of Religion,<note place="margin">Seriously,</note> the letters (about a hundred of which
I have) written with his own hand, or in cypher to the Governess, do clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to the Councel by the <hi>Governess;</hi> but discovered to his sister without reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
all his necessities, fears, and secret thoughts. And in these private
Letters, he so earnestly commends and commits unto her the protection of
Religion; that he plainly declares it was to be her master-care, and all other
Interests whatsoever, should give place to it.<note place="margin">With almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible care to root out Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> Nay, many times he instructs
her how to hunt out Hereticks, and trace them to their holes. His Majesty
likewise had Catalogues of their names (which I have by me, enclosed in
his Letters) so exactly taken, as every ones condition, neighbourhood, age,
and stature is to the life described, that truly it is wonderfull, how a Prince
distracted and diverted with such a multiplicity of State-affairs, could have
the leasure to inquire out, for the most part, obscure people, which a private
man could hardly get time to turn his thoughts and hand to. And by this
means, as often as Catholicks fled out of <hi>England</hi> into the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And with no little bounty to the banished <hi>English.</hi>
                  </note> in
whose behalf the <hi>Governess</hi> wrote to the King; with incredible celeritie
(besides his Pensions bestowed upon Priests of that Island, which for the
cause of Religion lived as banished men in the <hi>Low-countreys</hi>) he divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them sometimes 2000 Ducats at once: sometimes more, sometimes
less, alwayes something. Incouraged by this royall bounty, some Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of that Nation were begun to be settled, to the great good of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
in <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi> The <hi>Governess</hi> therefore of her own
accord, and by the Kings command, laboured to preserve Religion; and
having the Nobility particularly obliged to her for her late favour; she
dispatched letters to this effect to the Bishops and Governours of Towns,
which exceedingly awaked their industry.</p>
               <p>And now the Hereticks were carried to prison,<note place="margin">Hereticks put to death with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious success.</note> and put to death: which
terrified many, and those that died were often reconciled to the Church.
At <hi>Rupelmond,</hi> a Priest that was turned Heretick, when he saw no hope to
escape out of the Tower wherein he was imprisoned,<note place="margin">A bold fact of an hereticall Minister.</note> fell upon a desperate
designe of firing the next room in which the Records and Monuments of
the Provinces were kept supposing that while the guards were busied in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
things that concernd the publick, he might get away. He acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his fellow-prisoners, which were nine, with the plot; and now the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was in a flame, which the souldiers presently extinguished, and the Priest
being taken, was, with the rest of his companions, but a little more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">But it saved him at last.</note>
executed. For openly renouncing his Heresie, before the multitude that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41239:52"/>
was assembled to see him die; twice he cursed <hi>Calvin,</hi> and all the contrivers
of Heresie, and bad the good people take warning, how they came near that
plague-sore, which the Devil had sent from hell to infect mankind; and so
professing he died a Catholick, his head was struck off. The <hi>Governess</hi> left
out none of these passages in her Letter to the King,<note place="margin">August 13.</note> not doubting but they
would be welcome to a Prince desirous of such news. But at <hi>Antwer</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

When the Executioner brought him to the stake to be burned, suddenly as
the faggots were kindling, a showre of stones (cast from what hands was not
known) fell upon the place; the Hangman seeing his own danger if he stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet resolving not to leave the condemned man to the people, whipped out
his sword, and when he was half burned, killed him: then leaping down
among the souldiers, saved himself in the crowd. The mutineers thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
of their hopes, gave over for the present; either unable to master the
souldiers, or conceiving they should stir to no end, the prisoner being dead.

greater pride; all that was concluded, the more secretly it passed, onely in
presence of the Duke of <hi>Alva;</hi> with the more confidence, do some writers
(as if they had a blank before them) fill up the space with wit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
from hence, strange secrets of State. Omitting such divination, out of
the letters,<note place="margin">Septemb. 25</note> which I have,<note place="margin">What they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted of.</note> written in King <hi>Philips</hi> own hand, to his sister
about that conference, this I know. The Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> for divers weighty
reasons (no doubt by the command of King <hi>Philip</hi>) had desired her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Mother, whom it nearly concerned to preserve Religion then great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indangered in <hi>France,</hi> and they, very well affected to the cause, had laid
their designes; the Queen Regent by the by propounded some Marriages,
wherein she would have ingaged her Daughter, but the Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> returned thereunto no absolute answer, reserving
the finall determination of all things to King <hi>Philip.</hi> Lastly, upon occasion
of an Embassadour sent from <hi>Soliman</hi> the <hi>Turkish Emperour</hi> to renew the

said League, and that their King should joyn with King <hi>Philip</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

took no effect, the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> declining all overtures, but onely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

Rebells to Religion and their Prince, together with the marriage five years

thenceforth given, to expell heresie out of their Kingdomes: and plainly
faith, the Queen had not directly declared her self against the marriage, but
left a door open to a new consulation; since in regard of their tender years,
the young Prince and Princesse (he being but fifteen, and Princesse <hi>Elisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>

               <p>In the beginning of <hi>March,</hi>

                  </note> Count <hi>Egmont</hi> came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> contrary to
the exspectation and command of his Majestie, who would have had his
journey put off;<note place="margin">Feb. 15.</note> I suppose, because the <hi>Governess</hi> had informed him that
the Count was willing to go, in hope of his private advantage. Yet the
King received him very graciously, answerable to the quality of so noble a
person, and so great a Generall, famous for many victories: and often with
good approbation heard him move for relief to the publick necessities of his
Countrey. Nay, when he descended to his particular affairs, the King
granted his suit, almost in every thing. Finally,<note place="margin">The Kings An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> his Majestie gave him large
instructions in writing for answer to the <hi>Governess,</hi> and that he might resolve
upon more certain grounds he advised, in that which concerned Religion,
with Divines,<note place="margin">April 2.</note> which to that purpose waited on him. In that Assembly of
learned men,<note place="margin">Having first consulted the Divines, In this manner.</note> I have heard one that was present, say, The pietie of the King
was admirable: For having summoned the greatest Schoolmen and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists,
and demanding their opinions touching the Libertie of Conscience
which some Low-countrey Towns so earnestly petitioned for: when many
of them considering the present condition of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> said, That
for the avoiding of a greater evil, much to be feared, in Cities ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
and shake off Obedience to their Prince, and to the Orthodox Faith,
his Majestie might, without offending God, allow his subjects the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of their Religion; He replied, That he sent not for them to instruct
him, whether such a Permission were <hi>lawfull,</hi> but whether it were <hi>necessary.</hi>
And when they told him, they saw no necessity; then the King, in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
kneeling before a Crucifix; <hi>And I,</hi> said he, <hi>pray and beseech thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majestie, thou King of all men, O God, that thou wilt please to keep me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in this mind, that I may never care, that the men which deny thee for their
Lord, may either be, or be called my Subjects:</hi> and then he opened his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
concerning Religion in those Letters, which I told you were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to Count <hi>Egmont.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Majesty checks C. <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> for the Cognizances de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to affront <hi>Granvell.</hi>
                  </note> But before he had his dispatch, the King
dealt plainly with him, That he was not a little offended at the last
conspiracie of the Lords, when they gave the Coats and Cognizances,
wherein they aenigmatically threatned Cardinal <hi>Granvel,</hi> that especially <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
(reputed the Authour of that invention) might therein have shewn, if
not more fidelity, at least more discretion.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Egmont</hi> excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses himself,</note> But Count <hi>Egmont</hi> faithfully
assured his Majesty, that it was mere mirth, and childish sport at table, to
make a jest to laugh at in their cups, not to be feared by any man: that done,
he omitted not to accuse the <hi>Cardinall</hi> as the principall cause thereof,<note place="margin">And accuses the Cardinall.</note> because
he daily mustered those of his faction against the Nobility, and therefore
deserved to be requited with the like Assemblies. Yet in these meetings
(and this he often confirmed by oath) they did not so much as think of any
thing contrary to their sincere Allegiance to his Majesty: Nay, if he
had found any of their party an Enemy to the King; he himself would have
been first, though he were his own brother, that should have stabbed him to
the heart. This Discourse having passed between the King and Count <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
(of all which the King by a private Letter certified the <hi>Governess</hi>):
Instructions were given to the Count thus indorsed; <hi>Instructions of those

                  </note> The summe of his large Instructions
was this: At his arrivall in the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> after he had saluted the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness</hi>
from the King, and returned her his royall thanks for her good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of those Provinces, and for sending into <hi>Spain</hi> the fittest man to
negotiate for the <hi>Low-countreys;</hi> he was to deliver her this answer from his
Maiesty:<note place="margin">For preservation of Religion.</note> That in the first place he was struck with unutterable grief, to
hear of the growth of Heresie; and that he was firmly resolved, and would
have the whole world know, that he would not suffer it within his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
though he were to die for it a thousand times. Therefore he desired
the <hi>Governess</hi> to call a Senate extraordinary, to which divers Bishops should
be summoned, particularly <hi>Rythovius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ipres,</hi> with the like number
of Divines, and such Counsellours as stood best affected to Religion and
their Countrey. The <hi>pretended occasion</hi> should be to examine the Councel
of <hi>Trent;</hi> but the <hi>reall meaning</hi> to find out an Expedient, how the people
might be kept in their ancient Religion;<note place="margin">For destruction of Hereticks.</note> how their children might be virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
bred up at School; how to proceed in punishing Hereticks, by some
other course, that might take off the odium: not that he meant to pardon
them (for that he neither resolved to do, neither did he think it would be
acceptable to God, or safe for Religion;) but that he might in their deaths
prevent all hope of glorying, which was the cause of their impious and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sufferings. Moreover the Senate was to be so ordered, that the Councel
of Estate was to superintend the other two Councels of Law and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,<note place="margin">For regulation of the Councel.</note>
but nothing to be concluded, before the Governess knew thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to Count <hi>Egmont.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">April 2.</note> But he wrote others to the Governess, wherein
he gave her to understand, That it pleased him not, that the Authority of
the Senate (wherein sate the principall Lords of the <hi>Low-countreys</hi>) be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
which both straitens the power of the <hi>Governess;</hi> and might open a
way for divers great men, enriched by the Treasury, to change (as from other
hands was intimated) the present form of Government.<note place="margin">For disposall of the moneys sent by his hand.</note> He likewise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Count <hi>Egmont</hi> to let the <hi>Governess</hi> know, That his Majestie remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
the necessities of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which she had so often moved him in:
and therefore sent her, part in ready money, part in Bils of Exchange, 60000
Ducats to pay the common souldiers, and 200000 to be distributed among
the Garrisons; and for the Governours of Provinces, and the Magistrates
pensions 150000, and that he would have returned her more, for the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of Towns, and disbanding of souldiers, if he had not been in many
places to provide for his Fleet against the <hi>Turk.</hi> But some of this money
could not be got of the Bankers, because they were not satisfied in <hi>Spain.</hi>
Lastly, commending the integrity of his Judges and Officers, he put the
Governess and his Subjects of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For signification of his Majesties intended journey thither.</note> in hope, that he would
make a voyage thither, purposely to hear their Grievances, and in person

it would add to the <hi>Governesses</hi> joy, for the success of his <hi>Embassage,</hi>
that he should bring her sonn, a happiness she had long desired. Indeed it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41239:55"/>
rejoyced her very much; for when she saw her sonne <hi>Alexander,</hi> so well bred,
so lively spirited,<note place="margin">The Governesses joy upon the sight of her son. And news of a Match intended him by the King</note> yet tempered with such gravity, as became one that had

Sonne brought her the news of a Marriage intended him by the King.
Whereupon the Steward of her House, the Lord <hi>Theuloi,</hi> was purposely

                  <note place="margin">April 30.</note> to give his Majestie most humble thanks, for his Royall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours

to him; and he said,<note place="margin">His reasons.</note> (which I believe he had from <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth)
That as in the Globe of the Earth and Sea, the Moon is more predominant
then most of the Starrs, not because she hath a <hi>greater,</hi> but a <hi>nearer</hi> influence;
so we should think of our neighbours. And he maintained this opinion, as
I suppose, more fervently, because about that time <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the fourth
challenged the Principality of <hi>Camertio,</hi> which he entended to bestow upon
<hi>Frederick Borromeo,</hi> his Sisters sonne, lately married with his consent, to the
Noble Lady <hi>Virginia Ruveria Verana. Octavio</hi> therefore, weighing, in case
this dispute might beget a War, how much it concern'd him to be in amity
with the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> held it very convenient to make up this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
Nor did the <hi>Governess</hi> disapprove of the designe;<note place="margin">The Governess is of the same mind.</note> but in her husbands
and her own name, wrote about it to the King. But he, either because he
would have no affinitie with a <hi>Duke</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Faction; or because he had
thought of another Wife for him,<note place="margin">Octob. 1.</note> and had already shewed himself in it;

The Duke of</hi> Ferrara's <hi>Sister and Prince</hi> Alexander <hi>are of years so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable,
that it may cause disagreement. Indeed I commend the Duke of</hi>
Parma, <hi>that seeks the friendship of his neighbours, by desiring to match into this
family, but he ought likewise to consider, that so long as he hath me for his Brother
and Protectour, no man dare presume to trench upon him. As he may well perceive
by the late change of things, when</hi> Pius <hi>the fourth gave over his attempt. For

because She and King <hi>Philip</hi> were Brothers and Sisters children, and <hi>Mary</hi>
of <hi>Portugal</hi> was in the same degree of bloud, both to King <hi>Philip</hi> and his
Queen:<note place="margin">And Mother.</note> besides, by her Mother she was of the noble familiy of the <hi>Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,</hi>
which had often match'd with the Bloud-royall of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and kept
a House like a Kings Court. But Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> was farre more in love
with the Beautie and Virtue of the Ladie, then with the Merits of all her
Ancestours.</p>
               <p>The fame of this Princely Virgin was spread through <hi>Spain,</hi> and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servingly;<note place="margin">Princesse <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> peculiar commendations. Her wit and learning.</note>
for she had such an understanding that it was reported, there was
nothing she did not comprehend. She spake <hi>Latine</hi> fluently, and very well.
She was a pretty good <hi>Grecian;</hi> not ignorant of Philosophy, and excellent
in the Mathematicks. So versed in Scripture, that she could readily turn to
any Text in the Old or New Testament.<note place="margin">Sanctity of life.</note> But above all, she was admired
for innocency and holiness of life. Nothing pleased her so much in her
hours of retirement, as the contemplation of things Divine. And in her
familiar discourse, she often quoted short Maxims out of the Bible, or the
Fathers; wherewith in the day time while she was at work, she sweetly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up her heart to God.<note place="margin">Childish exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> Indeed she never put her hand to sowing, either nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-work
or imbroyderie, but onely to adorn the Altar, and for the use of the
poor,<note place="margin">Modesty.</note> that she might in both, adorn and cover Christ himself. Touching her
modesty, she was not onely <hi>carefull</hi> but <hi>proud</hi> of it, and said, <hi>Though women
were to conceal their other virtues, yet they might glory in their Chastity.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she forbare all publick Shews and Entertainments:<note place="margin">Care to preserve it.</note> as often as her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and the King her Uncle would dispense with her absence. And in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Poets, though she was very much taken with their wit, yet she
looked upon them with great fear, lest she might encounter any amorous
passages: and once, when she had took up <hi>Francesco Petrarch,</hi> and had run
over a few of his Verses, she threw him out of her hands. For the same
reason she could not be induced to let any Courtier lead her; or to lean upon
their arms or shoulders, the common garb of great Ladies, either out of
pride, or to be the better supported, going in high Chopines. These, and
many other virtues, commended the Match with <hi>Mary</hi> Princess of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
The <hi>Governess</hi> therefore, loosing no time after her Sonn <hi>Alexanders</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
sent the Royall Fleet well manned to sea,<note place="margin">The Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Fleet sent to transport the Bride.</note> and made <hi>Peter Ernest</hi>

were bound. Which being accordingly performed, by that eloquent and
religious man, with a fair gale of wind they failed out of the Port. But
when they were upon the main, the billows on a sudden growing angry,
swelled, they knew not why, and the storm increasing, the other ships being
scattered, onely one fell foul upon the Admirall that carried Princess <hi>Mary,</hi>
and having sprung many leaks, the poor ship was left a miserable spectacle,
the sea almost devouring her in their sight, and within hearing. But Princess
<hi>Mary</hi> moved with the piteous cries and lifted-up-hands of the wretched
drowning people p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mirall told her it could not be done,
without endangering her Highness, and the whole ship. The Marriners
affirmed the same, particularly the Master, an excellent Pilot, but unskilfull
in that Art of Navigation, which is directed by Divine hope. Then said
the Princess: <hi>But I, mark what my mind presages, do hope in God, if we do our
best to help them, that he will so graciously accept our endeavours, as it will please
him of his Goodness, to help us all.</hi> And this she spake with such a sense of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
and so sweet a look, that the Admirall durst not oppose her, but gave
order for the ship to succour them, which struggling and crowding through
the furious waves, at last came near them, and putting out her long Boat op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely
saved them all; but the ship it self, out of which they escaped,
having obeyed the Princesses command, a little while after sunk before their
faces, onely one man being lost in her. Nay, the very hour that Princess
<hi>Mary</hi> by Divine inspiration said, her mind presaged they should do well, the
rage of the winds abaited, and the scattered Fleet came together again.
Though within a few dayes, a new storm rising,<note place="margin">Another tempest drives her upon the coast of <hi>England.</hi> She refuses to send her service to Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabeth.</hi>

unhappy Coast of <hi>Britain,</hi> and forced them to put in at an <hi>English</hi> Harbour.
Where whilst they lay for a wind, Count <hi>Mansfoldt</hi> thought it a fitting Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to send some Noble person to present her service to the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in whose Dominions they remained. But Princess <hi>Mary</hi> would not,
she said; hold any correspondence with the Enemies of the Church. And
though others pressed her to it very much, affirming that she might safely,
upon such an occasion interchange common courtesies, she was constant to
her first resolve; adding, that it was safest for her self, and best for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of others. Yet beyond all exspectation, at the same time, she court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a noble hereticall Lady,<note place="margin">She invites an <hi>English</hi> Lady.</note> that came, among a multitude of the <hi>English,</hi>
to see the fleet. For Princesse <hi>Mary</hi> casting an eye upon her,<note place="margin">Begs her two sonnes of her.</note> and two fine
boyes, her sonnes which she brought with her, entertained her in a very
friendly manner: and finding, by her discourse, that she was the Mother of
many more children, she importuned the Lady to bestow these two upon
her, promising that she her self would be such a Mother to them, as it
should not repent her of the change. This she did, because (as she her self
professed) she was not able to suffer such a pair of young Innocents, that
looked like Angels, being corrupted with heresie, to be made Devils, and
numbered among the slaves condemned to eternal torments. And although
Princesse <hi>Mary</hi> could not prevail with the Mother,<note place="margin">But is denied.</note> in her suit for these
boyes; yet a few years after, God gave her the same number of that sex:
and it is probable that her desire of breeding up anothers children to be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41239:57"/>
Gods servants,<note place="margin">3565.</note> was recompensed by God himself with as many children of
her own.<note place="margin">One of her ships fired acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.</note> Nor will I omit a memorable passage, that happened in the same
Port, where one of the Kings ships, by accident was set on fire, not farre
from the Admirall where the Princesse was aboard. And while some strove
to quench the flame, and some to save themselves, and their goods: she
running out of her Cabin to the Prow, made a little stop, and said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Well,
and shall I lose my box of sacred Reliques? presently the flame approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near her,<note place="margin">Her care greater for her Reliques then for her jewels.</note> she ran back, and with a mighty courage plucked the box out
of the Cabinet: either forgetting or despising the jewels it contained, to an
infinite value. Presently returning again from her Cabin (for the furie of
the fire was not yet asswaged) a Gentleman met her, and stepping in, with
great reverence, took her by the arm, and beseeched her, whilst she might,
to flie the danger. But she, casting a frown upon the man, said, Sir, you
were best unhand me.<note place="margin">For her soul then for her body.</note> As if she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and the fire being presently extinguished, they set sail for the Low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.<note place="margin">She lands in the Low countreys.</note>
About the beginning of November, the fleet arrived at <hi>Ulushing,</hi>
where she was received, and attended, by such as the Governess had sent

<hi>Maximilian de Bergen, Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Cambray</hi> married them. The King of

revived the memory of that Day in all kind of shews and pleasures, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to forget their present discontents and factions. So great was the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry

which we must often mention in the progresse of this History, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it will be the best, in this place to summe them up together. Princesse
<hi>Mary</hi> now come into <hi>Italy,</hi> was received with unusuall pomp and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41239:57"/>
For drawing near to <hi>Parma</hi> she was met by two gallant troops,<note place="margin">1565.</note> one of
Lords, the other of Ladies, her husband <hi>Alexander</hi> being in the head of
that, and this led by his Aunt <hi>Vittoria Farneze,</hi> wife to the Duke of <hi>Urbin.</hi>
On that side, such a multitude of horses, and on the other, such a world of
Coaches, vying bravery and rich Liveries; that seldome hath been seen a

                  <note place="margin">Her pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to beg a Son of God.</note> And
she her self many times having prayed to God for a Sonne to continue the
name of the <hi>Farnezes,</hi> accidently conceived a hope, that if she took up some
Orphan or beggar-boy, and bred him for Charity, she should compasse her
desire. She therefore took up one in the street and bred him in her Court:
and nine moneths after, she was delivered of <hi>Ranucio.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">She prayes for and obtains another.</note> But her <hi>hope</hi> proving

thither, she turned to him, and said, <hi>Come, Sir, let us joyn our prayers to God,

Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> then it was of admiration and reverence towards his wife,
at whose suit, God had given him both his Sonnes. From thenceforth, he
more and more honoured her Sanctimonie;<note place="margin">Prince <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> confidence in her prayers.</note> insomuch, as at the battle of

being reproved by <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> he replyed, He had at Home
the Cause and Patronesse of his confidence. Indeed she spent the whole
time of that warre in devotion and penance for her husband.<note place="margin">The education of her children.</note> But for her
children, because she knew they were granted her by Gods speciall favour,
she bent her study, while she lived, to season their tender years with divine
precepts: and when she came to die, was not so earnest with her husband
for any thing,<note place="margin">Which she dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commends to her Lord. <hi>Qu. Blanch</hi> with an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prayer.</note> as to be carefull of their education, using that very prayer to

                  <hi>thou wilt hasten their ends, and prevent their treason against thy Majesty.</hi>
A prayer worthy all mother-Queens, that would have no children, but such
as will acknowledge God, the Lord of all, to be their father, And so the
eleventh year after her marriage, dyed Princesse <hi>Mary,</hi> no lesse admirable in
her death,<note place="margin">Her patience in the pangs of death.</note> then in her life. For as in this, she was most nobly active, so in
the other she was most undauntedly passive, the onely glory that remains

printed, and bound up with her life) what her judgement was, concerning
Christian perfection; and how she applyed her self to that progressive
rule, indeed so exactly, as the Houses of <hi>Portugall</hi> and <hi>Farneze</hi> may glory in
the beauty of her mind: and the example of Princesse <hi>Mary,</hi> may be set for

though it were to put themselves in the power of the</hi> Germans, <hi>the</hi> French, <hi>or of

of the Gentry, seconded by the mutiny of the
people, and the turbulent counsels of the Lords, the
furious incursion of Hereticks, Sacriledge; with <hi>ruine</hi>
of Religion, and no lesse ignominy to the Authours.
The Edict formed by the <hi>Governess,</hi> was sent and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in the Kings name, by the severall Governours
of Provinces,<note place="margin">What the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces conceived of the Edict proposed.</note> but some of them first complained to her Excellence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
they were not able to govern the people with that severity enjoyned
by the Edict. Nay, divers plainly told her, they would not be guiltie of
burning five or six thousand men in their Provinces; whereof the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
advertised the King,<note place="margin">Ianuary 9.</note> warning him of the storm which she foresaw.
The first signe and terrour of the Tempest lightened out of <hi>Brabant.</hi> For
when the Chancellour of that Province had propounded the Kings Edict to
the <hi>Brabanters</hi> (who have no other Governour but his Majesties Lieutenant
over all the Low-countreys)<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Brabant</hi> first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses to obey the Edict.</note> immediately the chief Cities of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bolduc.</note>
that is, <hi>Lovain, Bruxels, Antwerp,</hi> and the <hi>Bus,</hi> assembling the Senate,
and petitioning the Chancellour, very violently and angerly, desired that
their Priviledges might not be violated, to which in regard the Judicature of
the Inquisitours, and the Emperours Decrees were repugnant, they ought
not to have been so easily proposed by the Chancellour, nor could they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
admit them. The Governess having notice of the Petition, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to be brought and read at the Councel Table. And though some held
it a bold request, yet it was her pleasure, the Annals and Records of <hi>Brabant</hi>
should be searched, especially the Commentaries of <hi>Francis Hulst</hi> a <hi>Braban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
who first executed the Office of Inquisitour in that Province. Upon
sight whereof,<note place="margin">Some condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made, but it gives no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</note> answer was made. That because from the year 1550, this
kind of Inquisition was not used in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and that the King had declared
his resolution, to innovate nothing, therefore it pleased his Majestie there
should be no change within their Government; but onely that the Decrees
of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth should be in force, till it was otherwise ordered by the
King. Which moderate Answer neither satisfied the <hi>Brabanters,</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41239:59"/>
themselves all their desires: and yet encouraged those of <hi>Flanders,</hi> to
present such another Petition to the Governess. But her Excellence was by
a speciall Messenger, ingaged in business of higher concernment. For she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
fearfull intelligence from a man, till then unknown,<note place="margin">Intelligence of many persons of quality in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> that were to enter into a League against the Edict.</note> but by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of <hi>Christopher Assonvill,</hi> a worthy Senatour, privately admitted to
her presence; That many noble persons of <hi>Brabant</hi> had entred into an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation,
in case the King should by force impose the Inquisitours upon their
Province, that they would by force defend themselves: which confidence
was built upon a privy confederation betwixt them and certain forreiners,
principally <hi>Gaspar Colligny</hi> Admirall of <hi>France.</hi> Some such thing the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> a little while after wrote from <hi>Leyden</hi> to the Governess.<note place="margin">March 29.</note> And the
same was discovered to her by the Counts of <hi>Egmont</hi> and <hi>Megen,</hi> who said,
The Conspiratours had privately issued out Commissions to Captains and
Colonels; and that if need required, they had in a readiness above twentie
thousand men: But what manner of Conspiracie this was, and the Original
of it, I shall now demonstrate out of the Letters, which are in my custody,
written by some that were purposely appointed to examine the matter of
fact. For when the <hi>Governess,</hi> the year after this, by the Kings command
sent certain persons, hastily to inquire in the respective Provinces, who they
were that had raised or fomented this years tumults: they seized upon the
Letters, Books, and Notes of many men, out of which compiling a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
they informed his Majesty and the Governess, of the beginning and
progress of this designe. And in discharge of what I have undertaken,
partly from thence, partly from other Records, I borrowed this which in
short I shall deliver to you.</p>
               <p>Long before the bloudshed of this year 1566,<note place="margin">1550.</note> some of the Nobilitie of
the Low-countreys,<note place="margin">The Originall of the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, some Noblemens sons bred up Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks abroad.</note> in particular some young Lords (none of which I

sojourning for a long time at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and such like Towns, were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
intrapped by the Hereticks. For they had onely been so far instructed
in Religion, as might serve to keep them Catholicks at home; but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to teach them, if they should be circumvented, how to distinguish
truth from falsehood; and truly no man ought to come near infected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
without a Preservative about him. These young Noblemen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having been new-catec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

Nor did many of the Merchants wish a greater happiness,<note place="margin">The Merchants are of the same mind.</note> then this
Liberty: for themselves were inveigled with the like strange opinions, and
consequently would have no one for Religion to be barred free Traffick.
These joyning their Counsels, plotted,<note place="margin">They consult to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> for which they had divers examples,
by degrees to shake from the shoulders of their Countrey, the yoke of the
Catholick Faith, that would not suffer any other doctrine to predominate
within their Cities. This designe,<note place="margin">When they first set afoot their Designe.</note> I collect, was laid in the year 1559, when
King <hi>Philip,</hi> resolving to return to <hi>Spain,</hi> commanded that his Fathers and
his own Edicts (which during the Wars could not) should now be strictly
observed. Which happening in that conjunction of time, when the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> advised the Low-countrey men,<note place="margin">Falling just up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of time, whilst the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to expell the <hi>Spanish.</hi>
                  </note> to petition for disbanding the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
souldiers, lest by their means the <hi>Spanish Inquisition</hi> should forcibly have
been imposed upon them (as he himself hath left recorded in his Apology)
I do not think it improbable,<note place="margin">1581.</note> that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> might be privie to
matters then in agitation: Yet I believe not, that upon the first conference
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41239:60"/>
of the Nobility and Merchants,<note place="margin">3566.</note> any thing was certainly pitched upon,<note place="margin">For a long while they are quiet. Vpon accasion of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> they shew themselves.</note> or
the form of a Confederation conceived in writing, Nor is it likely, that a
Conspiracy of many persons, should for six years lie undiscovered. But
then the seeds of Rebellion were onely sown, which afterwards in the year
1564, when Cardinal <hi>Granvell</hi> went into <hi>Burgandy,</hi> sprung up by occasion of
the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> as I am well assured out of the said Notes and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.<note place="margin">1564.</note>
Moreover, in that year 64, those Gentlemen and Merchants which
met about it, knowing that so great a weight could not be supported with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
arms, determined to try the Hereticall Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> either to get
their assistance, or at lest to have some colour for using of their names to aw

till the end of the year 653 yet in the beginning of 66, when the Edicts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

great grievances; then the Conspiratours, pretending to maintain the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Subject, with incredible dexterity scattered Libels over all the
Provinces (to the number of five thousand,<note place="margin">April 3.</note> as the Governess afterwards

Fears and Jealousies were increased by preparation for a war,<note place="margin">They are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with fears and jealousies.</note> made in <hi>Spain</hi>
by the King: wherein the Duke of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> Pay-master-generall for his

Yet when the Governess went about to perswade the multitude, she
found it Labour in vain; the Hereticks disputing against her, and affirming
That it was the ordinary trick of State, to pretend war for one place, and
fall upon another. So that many men openly professed, they would fell

aimed, by these troubles, to shake off their old Prince, and set up a new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
But all of them pretended and petitioned for the taking away of
the Inquisition, and a gentler execution of the Emperours Edicts against the
Hereticks. And this Petition was presented in all their names to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">March 15.</note>
who by her letters certified his Majestie, as well of the publick as
private carriage of the conspiracy.<note place="margin">The Governesses diligence to frustrate their designs.</note> Moreover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as she was ignorant of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that passed among them (for in their Cities and private houses her
Spies, which are the ears and eyes of Princes, knew all they did, and gave
her intelligence) so, making no shew of fear, she thought it best to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
her self, in case they should break out into Rebellion. She therefore
minded the people of their duty by her Edict, the Magistrates by her let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and she had her private, Confidents that viewed the towns and their
Fortifications. She caused it to be reported that the King would shortly
come in person. She sent Expresses post to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadours resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with the Emperour, the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> to let
them know what a conspiracy was set a foot in the Low-countreys, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
as it was said the <hi>Germans, English,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> were the Incendiaries.
Shortly, she omitted nothing, that might either expresse her knowledge of
what was then plotted,<note place="margin">She hath intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of their resolution to come to <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xels</hi> which frights her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much.</note> or her courage to oppose it. At this time she had
intelligence given her by Count <hi>Megen,</hi> That about the beginning of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,
some five hundred Gentlemen intended to come to <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
her a Petition against the Inquisition, and the Emperours Edicts. Others
told her (as commonly true reports are mixed with falsities) that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiratours
were resolved, unlesse she gave them audience, to bring their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into the Town, and carry away the Governesse to <hi>Vilvord,</hi> there to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
her prisoner, till she had granted their desires. Which though a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> first
she laughed at, yet in the end (as it may be gathered by her letters) she
doubted, whether it would not be safest for her to leave the Town, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to some place of strength. In the mean time,<note place="margin">She summons a great Councel.</note> she summoned a fuller
Senate then ordinary, to meet upon the twenty seventh of March: not so
much to hear their advices, as to sound their affections; and lest they might
turn her enemies, whom she did not <hi>acknowledge</hi> to be her friends. Then
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41239:61"/>
writing new letters into <hi>Spain,</hi> she represented to his Majestie the present
condition of the Low-countreys, complaining, that she had often foretold
it, but never could be heard.</p>
               <p>The Governours of Provinces, the Knights of the <hi>Golden-fleece,</hi> and the
Lords of the privy Councell,<note place="margin">April 3.</note> met all upon the day appointed, and sate in
Senate next day; where by the Senatour <hi>Filibert Bruxellius</hi> divers letters
were read containing, whether true or false, the conspiracie of the Lords,
and the Hereticks designes. The Governesse making a short speech,<note place="margin">The Governesse asks the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours advice Whether the Covenanters were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</note> That

<hi>By Henry Brederod.</hi> Then, what answer she should make to their demands,
which Fame had then divulged. Lastly, what course should be taken to
dissolve that confederation, and how the new motions of those turbulent
men might speedily be composed. The Lords came thither severally affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
many hated the Inquisition, others had secret projects, and few but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
their private interest before the publick.<note place="margin">Duke <hi>Areschot</hi> and Count <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamont</hi> answer negatively.</note> 
                  <hi>Philip Croi</hi> Duke of <hi>Areschot</hi>
and <hi>Charles</hi> Count <hi>Barlamont</hi> were of opinion, that the Conspiratous should
not be suffered to enter the citie so many at once, <hi>For what need of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men to deliver one Petition? that they could not think such pomp fit for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants:
that they might send, out of their number, some one of quality, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
their desires with lesse ostentation and envie. Lastly, that either the Ports
should be shut, which they rather inclined to; or that, in the next place, there should
be many eyes upon their behaviour, and such as carried themselves contumacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be forthwith punished.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is far their admission.</note> Contrarily the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (that hated those
Lords as <hi>Cardinallists,</hi> and especially <hi>Areschot,</hi> for the old contest of the
Houses of <hi>Croi</hi> and <hi>Nassau</hi> about Precedency) affirmed those fears to be
vain, that were conceived against persons not unknown to him, many of
them being allyed to him in friendship, some in bloud; that it would be a
great indignity, if that were not permitted to Noblemen which is lawfull
for the poorest peasant, to petition. To the same effect, that no danger could
be in their coming, spake Count <hi>Egmont:</hi> Especially since,<note place="margin">Count <hi>Egmont</hi> concurs with him.</note> if they were to
be resisted forcibly, or by the sword, he did not see how the Governesse
was prepared to encounter men already armed, and likely, by such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
to be exasperated:<note place="margin">Count <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldt</hi> is against their coming.</note> That it was not safe to affront those we have not
power to destroy. But though Count <hi>Mansfeldt</hi> liked not the <hi>Popes</hi> Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitours
in the Low-countreys, yet he said, it was ill done of those that by
such mutiny and tumult behaved themselves more proudly then became pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners;
and added, that he had schooled his Sonne <hi>Charles,</hi> who he heard
was one of the Conspiratours. And indeed I have a letter of his,<note place="margin">March 26.</note> wherein
with great fury he disclaims him for his sonne, unlesse he presently renounce
that league, and bids him otherwise never hope to recover his fathers favour.
But the youth being of a fiery nature, slighted those admonitions and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
belike he thought his Father was not in earnest, and therefore would
not leave his party for the present. The Counts of <hi>Aremberg,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">So are the Counts <hi>Arem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Megen,</hi> had
the same sense of the conspiracy and Covenant, as if by such ostentation of
their forces, they came to <hi>compell,</hi> not to <hi>intreat</hi> their Prince: and concluded,
That a Treaty of this kind should be rejected, or, to use milder terms, put off.
Nor could such a sudden confederacy last long, but in a little time must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
fall asunder, for no Mutineers were ever constant to their Principles,
or to one another. The rest of the Senatours spake doubtfully and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
of the Covenanters,<note place="margin">How the rest voted.</note> violently and plainly against the Inquisition. The
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41239:62"/>
same arguments, though in a more obscure and remisse manner, were made
against the Emperour's Edicts. By degrees,<note place="margin">Many of them complain of the King.</note> they fell to complaints against
the King,<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</note> and pressed them with more confidence, because they knew he
had then more use of their services. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> said, he could
add to those old Grievances (but perhaps he feigned new ones, that he might
have the more colour to desert the Kings interest, and to pursue his own) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was lately informed, some enemies to the House of <hi>Nassau,</hi> had
moved his Majestie to take off his head, and confiscate his estate: and that
the King onely exspected an opportunity to sign the warrant.<note place="margin">In these words.</note> 
                  <hi>Was this the
reward of service done in the late warres by the Low-countrey Lords, for defence of
his Authority in the</hi> Netherlands? <hi>though he had now sufficient experience, that
King</hi> Philip <hi>looked not upon the Low-countreys with the eyes of his Father</hi> Charles
<hi>the fifth. That the King had sent forty thousand Ducats to the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>to
pay her souldiers, whilest the Low-countreys were greatly distressed for money, which
his Majestie never thought of. That he taxed not the King for the unseasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of that assistance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For the money was lost, as we have told you.</note> 
                  <hi>nor the unfortunate successe it had, but he feared the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
<hi>whose throats were to be cut (if report were true) for that summ of money,
would revenge it upon the Low-countrymen. Especially since the money was come into

break off his speech, intreated him to forbear his private expostulations whilst
the publick business was in agitation: &amp; that he would not wrong his discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so far, as to have such thoughts of the King, who was the mercifullest of
all Princes. That she knew for certain, what was reported of that money, was
the mere invention of some seditious persons, intending, by such lies, to
bring an odium upon his Majestie; as well with his subjects of the <hi>Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">At first in vain.</note>
as with forrein Princes. For all this, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> would not
make an end, though he was at other times a rare dissembler, and had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over his passions. But it may be, he thought it concerned him to speak
on, lest it should be imagined he begun without a cause. As if were an
argument of just anger, not to be friends upon the sudden. Following his
example, neither Count <hi>Horn,</hi> nor any of the rest were silent, but every one
made his complaint. Nevertheless,<note place="margin">But at length he and all seem better contented and the Councell proceeding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to admit the Covenanters</note> qualifying them with gentle and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
language, and putting them in hope of his Majesties royall favour, the
<hi>Governess</hi> called them into the Senate; and by the major-vote it was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the Covenanters should be admitted, but without arms, and upon
promise of their good behaviour. And the Governours of Provinces
(through which it was supposed they would pass to <hi>Bruxels</hi>) were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by their Letters, to acquaint the people with this resolution of the
Senate: Courts of guard were likewise appointed through the Citie, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees
to keep the gates, and a Garrison put into the Tower, lest there might
be a tumult among the distracted people. It being now almost night, the
Senate was adiourned till the next morning. At which time,<note place="margin">At the Senates next meeting,</note> the Lords and
Senators meeting in the House, the Governess fearing they would fall upon
private differences, and obstruct the business of the day, prevented them
with a speech,<note place="margin">The Governess speaks to them in this manner,</note> which I give you, as she wrote it to the King.<note place="margin">April 3.</note> 
                  <hi>If the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

what related to your private discontents. But admit they were just, yet they loose
part of that Iustice if they be importune; at least they avert the minds of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and provoking their spirits, hinder their discovery of the Truth.</hi> Brederod

                  <hi>I now

what Answer I should return them. But before you declare your selves, I
think it will be neither troublesome to you, nor improper for the business in debate, to
prepare you with a few words.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Edicts.</note> 
                  <hi>I hear there are many that presume openly to cavil
at the Edicts of the Emperour my Father (for to the Inquisition I will speak anon)
as if it were a barbarous tyrannie, not to be endured by Subjects. Truly whosoever
sayes it, not onely injures the memory of that wise Prince, and most affectionate to
his Countrey; but wrongs your Order of the</hi> Fleece, <hi>this Senate-house, and the
States Generall of the</hi> Low-countreys: <hi>for by all your approbations and consents,
the Emperour passed these Laws, as no doubt but some of you remember; and all may
read in the Edict published the year 1531; upon which, all the rest of his Decrees
are grounded. Why then do they now accuse the severity of the Emperour? Why
do they condemn those Acts which they did once approve: and which they know
were established by the suffrages of all? What? because the disease is more violent,
must the remedie therefore be neglected, and that which reason perswades? When
the Gangrene of Heresie daily creeps upon new parts of the Common-wealth, should
we remissely use fire and incision?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>Nor was the Ecclesiasticall power of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
against Hereticks, delegated for any other cause, but that the impudence of
wicked men might be abated by fear, or extinguished by punishment. I know there
is a generall hatred against this Court of Iustice, which for the present my meaning
is not to contradict or confute;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Which she proves to be neither new, nor more severe then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Edicts.</note> 
                  <hi>yet you know, this Tribunall is no</hi> innovation <hi>in the</hi>
Low-countreys: <hi>It is now sixteen years since my Father settled it in these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
But I pray, what severitie is in this Censure of the Inquisitours, that is
not in my Fathers Edicts? Nay, if you will rightly consider it, they were much
more severe; so that his Majestie in his Letters, which three years since I read to
many of you, iustly admires how the</hi> Low-countrey <hi>men could be so terrified with
the</hi> Spanish Inquisition; <hi>they being for the same causes of Religion, liable to farr
more and greater penalties, comprehended in the Edicts of</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth.
Which Edicts, if they were wisely drawn up and passed, by the Consent of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states;
I see no reason why men should so bitterly and violently inveigh against the
Inquisition, that relates to the same thing in a more gentle manner. Nor have I
spoken this to controll the freedome of Your votes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Then leaves them to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their Votes.</note> 
                  <hi>they had and shall ever have
their full libertie for me: Be you carefull that neither discontent nor faction may
deprive you of that Libertie.</hi> So proceeding to suffrages, many voted that
nothing in the Emperours Edicts should be altered.<note place="margin">Some approve the Edict, and would not have the Laws alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> 
                  <hi>Lawes before they passe
should be debated: after they are passed, obeyed. Nor can a State be more indanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then by the altering of their Laws: especially since it concerned them in point
of honour at this meeting, to make no concession to the Hereticks, who, if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in their first suit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The major part dislike it, and would have a temporary alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> 
                  <hi>would never make an end of petitioning.</hi> Divers others
argued against it, very passionately shewing, <hi>That it plainly appeared those
Imperiall Edicts neither provided sufficiently for Religion, which every day was
lesse observed; nor for the security of the State, which they saw was disturbed mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon that occasion. And yet the end and intention of Laws is, to preserve
Religion and Peace, but neither was effected by these Edicts. Why therefore should
it be thought unlawfull, that some penalties should be remitted, some changed? The
Edicts by that means rendered more moderate, and the Subjects more obedient to
them. Truly it was more dishonour to a Prince to keep Laws in force, which his
Subjects will not obey; then to apply them unto their natures,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rayling at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against the Inquisition, as hatefull to all sorts.</note> 
                  <hi>and so keep his people
in obedience. But for the Inquisition, it was apparent, that none of any condition
whatsoever, would receive it: insomuch that the meanest tradesman of
Antwerp,
can shew either a Musket or a Pike, which he threatens to use upon them, that shall
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41239:63"/>
endeavour to bring in the Inquisition. Nay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Injurious to the Bishops.</note> 
                  <hi>it was no little iniury to the Bishops to
have the cause of Religion, which by Law appertains to their Iurisdiction, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to this late Iudicature of Inquisitours. But it is to no purpose any more to
dispute this point,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And opposed by the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> 
                  <hi>when the Covenanters are at the gates, before whose Requests be
denied, it must be considered, in case the Hereticks joyning with them, should offer
to storm the Town, whether we have sufficient forces to resist the people and their
Confederates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">And they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</note> the opinion, number, and faction of these men carried it: For
though there wanted not some that easily refuted all that was pretended
in behalf of the Bishops; yet hardly any one of the Senate thought this
kind of Judicature seasonable for the time: therefore after many heats, the
business was thus composed.<note place="margin">The Resolution of the Councell upon both the points.</note> Forasmuch as the Emperours and the Kings
designe reached no farther in these Edicts and Questions of Faith, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to preserve Religion in her ancient purity; those remedies were onely so
far to be made use of, as might conduce to its preservation. Besides, there
was a twofold Inquisition, the one annexed to the function of Bishops, the
other granted by Commission from his <hi>Holiness</hi> to certain Judges Delegates.
Now the odium onely fell upon the <hi>Popes</hi> Inquisitours; which though
brought into the <hi>Low-countreys</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth; yet he was inforced
thereto, by reason of the small number, and great negligence of the Bishops.
This being no longer a reason,<note place="margin">To put down the Inquisition.</note> and men so much abhorring the name of this
forrein Inquisition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so violent and impolitick a Remedie ought not to obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon refractory people. Therefore without preiudice to Religion,
some part of the Covenanters petition might be granted. But lest they
should seem to be over-awed by the Hereticks, or to passe any thing in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of them,<note place="margin">So the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters are to be answered.</note> this answer was to be returned: <hi>That they had no cause to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themselves about the Inquisition, which was out of date; the Inquisitours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
forbearing to exercise their authority, having not renewed their Commission
from the new</hi> Pope,<note place="margin">Pius V.</note> 
                  <hi>which they use to do, for the better confirmation of their power.
Touching the penalties which by the Imperiall Edicts were to be inflicted upon He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And to qualifie the Emperours Edicts.</note>
                  <hi>they should not be repealed; but whereas most of them were capitall, they
should be hereafter qualified; for the Bishops, the greatest Divines and Lawyers, and
the Inquisitours themselves had so advised: which</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth would have
consented to, if he were now living, who himself upon the like difficulties, in the
year 1550, at the request of his Sister</hi> Mary <hi>Queen of</hi> Hungary, <hi>thought it not
unnecessary nor unbeseeming his Imperiall Maiesty, to rectifie and moderate the Laws
he had formerly decreed. Thus, for the present the Conspiratours being graciously
received, in a little while their meetings would be dissolved (a work of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence)
and in the interim, time might be gained to agitate the publick business
without Tumults, and therefore with more Authority.</hi> The Governess, though
she wished better,<note place="margin">Why the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness rather <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives</hi> then <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves</hi> this Decree.</note> yet approved the Counsel given, because she knew that
in this juncture of time, she must either grant something to the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
or else forcibly resist them. But this she durst not attempt, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided
of a Generall, for she trusted not the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the question to Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> he denied to draw his sword against any
man for the Inquisition, or the Edicts. For the rest of the Nobility, they
either had not much more loyaltie, or had far less abilities. Her Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
therefore told them, she would follow their advice, and so answer <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derod</hi>
and his Companions, that she might at once both satisfie them, and
withall reserve the Judgement entire to the King, without knowledge of
whose pleasure, nothing could be done in a matter of so great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:41239:63"/>Every one of these particulars she wrote to his Maiestie by speedy messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,<note place="margin">April 3.</note>

The same day about evening, the Covenanters came into <hi>Bruxels.</hi>

                  </note> They

his Order of the Fleece into <hi>Spain,</hi> and thereupon <hi>Verdugo</hi> was commanded
to bring the Statute-book of the Order, that they might see in what words
they had obliged their faith to the King, as supreme Master of their Society.
But Count <hi>Mansfeld</hi> interposing,<note place="margin">Afterward <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derod</hi> assembles the Covenanters at <hi>Cuilemburg</hi>-house.</note> nothing was determined. The same was
moved another time, as <hi>Anderlech</hi> informed the Governess. The next day
<hi>Brederod,</hi> staying for the Counts of <hi>Cuilemburg</hi> and <hi>Bergen,</hi> in <hi>Cuilemburg</hi>-House
at <hi>Bruxells</hi> assembled his Confederates, to encourage them in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
they had undertaken. First, he shewed them a Letter, writ in <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,</hi>
lately sent him, as he said, out of <hi>Spain:</hi> unless the man, who wanted
no subtiltie, had peradventure counter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eited it; as he suspects that wrote all
these passages in cypher, to the Governess. In which letter it was certified,
that one <hi>Moro,</hi> a man known in the Low-countreys, was with a soft fire
burned alive in <hi>Spain,</hi> which infinitely exasperated and enflamed the minds
of his Associates against the cruelty of such sentences. Then taking his
hint to come to the matter; as if he were to make a generall muster of his
Army, he produced the Roll, signed by all the Conspiratours. Which he
and <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Nassau</hi> reading unto the people, they answered to their severall
names, professing constancy to their resolutions: For those that were absent
(being to the number of two hundred) they that were present being almost
as many, engaged themselves. Then he required them, in confirmation of
the Covenant,<note place="margin">An additionall Oath taken.</note> every one to joyn his heart, and set to his hand again. Which
was accordingly done, and they all now the second time took the Covenant,
their Oath being this in substance;<note place="margin">The form of the Oath.</note> 
                  <hi>That if any of the Covenanters should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
either for Religion, or for the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> immediately the rest, all business
laid aside, should repair to both or one of those that were to tender the Covenant in
the severall Provinces, and that all of them, if need were, should presently take up
arms to assist their brethren.</hi> So he dismissed them full of courage and alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
resolved next morning to attend the Governess; Which day being the
fifth of <hi>April,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">From thence they march to the Court.</note> the Conspiratours to the number of about two hundred, met
again at <hi>Cuilemburg</hi>-House, and from thence took their way directly to
Court, marching through the high Street, the whole City beholding the
spectacle with amazement, and many not well knowing by what name to
call that new kind of Embassie. For they looked not like Petitioners, that
came to make demands in so confident and imperious a way; especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
led on by <hi>Brederod</hi> and <hi>Nassau,</hi> that did not use to supplicate: nor did they
seem to be a Faction, or to pretend force, coming with such appearance of
simplicity, that rather shewed like Fryars going in Procession. They rode
two a breast, most of them matched in years: <hi>Brederod</hi> and <hi>Nassau</hi> brought
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41239:64"/>
up the Rere. The Town took notice that one of the Generalls was lame,
which many looked upon as an evil Omen, and not without much laughter.
Entring the Court, they found the Governess, (the Senate then newly risen)
speaking with some of the Lords; <hi>Brederod</hi> coming up to the chair of State,
after he had done his duty with the Ceremonies due to the <hi>Governess,</hi> spake
in this manner:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Brederod</hi> in the name of them all, speaks thm to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness.</note> 
                  <hi>These Gentlemen of the</hi> Low-countreys, <hi>now standing in your
Highness presence, and others of the same quality that will shortly follow in great
numbers, are come with me to let Your Highness know by their multitude, how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
they are in their demands, expressed in this humble Petition: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd whilst you
read it, I beseech your Excellence to believe, that these honest men propound no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to themselves, but obedience and honour to the King, and safetie in their
Countrey.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And presents her a Petition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of three Heads.</note> When he had spoken this,<note place="margin">Subjoyning these Complaints out of his Papers.</note> he presented the Petition, and said that
he had something else to offer to her Highness in the names of his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates;
but lest he should mistake their sense, if he might presume so far, he
desired leave to read it out of his own Papers. The Governess was pleased
he should read his Notes, the summe whereof was, <hi>That the Gentlemen were
much aggrieved, because her Excellence had writ to the Provinces of their League,
as if it were made by a concurrence and association with the</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Germans,
<hi>pretending indeed the safetie of their Countrey, but intending onely spoyl and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Which information given unto the</hi> Governess, <hi>as it was an insufferable inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the Low-countrey Gentlemen, so they humbly and earnestly beseeched her Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to declare the Informers names, &amp; compell them to bring in their impeachment
publickly, in a Legall way. That if their Confederates be found guilty, they may
be sentenced; or if they be cleared and acquitted of the Crime, those informers, by the
Law of Retaliation, may have the punishment of Traitours.</hi> The Governess sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the trouble and indignation of her mind, as well as she could, with
a chearfull look received the Petition, wherein it was prayed, that the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
might be abolished, the old Edicts repealed, and new ones made by
the Estates of the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi> Her answer was,<note place="margin">To part she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers.</note> 
                  <hi>She would consider of
their Petition, and since it related onely to the Kings Honour and their Countreys
safety, they need not doubt but she would give them satisfaction. But whereas they
complained of her Letters written to the Provinces, they had no reason for it: she
did but what her place required (having received intelligence from many hands,
of a certain League made with forreiners) in advising the</hi> Governours <hi>and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
to be vigilant, lest upon that occasion, their Provinces might be troubled, not
so much by the Low-countrey men, whom the King ever found loyall; as by the
Borderers that resorted to them.</hi> Without more words, she dismissed the
Gentlemen,<note place="margin">Part she takes no notice of.</note> not naming her Intelligencers, which they exceedingly pressed,
her Highness letting such questions pass, as she had not minded them; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seeming offended, that they should press her to reveal secrets of State.
Nay, the same day at evening, when a Senatour in the House perswaded her
Excellence, to give in to the Covenanters the names of those Intelligencers;
she answered somewhat angerly, That she admired, that he, who refused to
name his Authour for things which he himself a little while since had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
should now perswade the contrary, that might be prejudiciall to so
many. In that Senate the Governess read the Petition of <hi>Brederod,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Put to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether the Covenanters should be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to set their names to the Petition present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness.</note> and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them if they had not altered their opinions. But when they had debated
it, they voted the same again, in other words. It was then disputed. Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the Covenanters had writ in generall; <hi>We his Majesties most humble
Subjects,</hi> whether it should not be required that every particular person
under-write his name, whereby the King might know, whom to thank, or
rather whom to be revenged upon. But it was carried by most voices in

the Negative:<note place="margin">1556.</note> lest upon occasion of getting the names of such as were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,<note place="margin">Resolved, that they should not be required to subscribe their names.</note>
the Petition shold be sent to the great Towns, and more drawn in.
The next day, the Confederates returning in greater numbers (for the
Counts of <hi>Cuilemburg</hi> and <hi>Bergen,</hi> were yet in time come post) the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
returned the Petition, which she had received the day before, together
with her Answer writ in the Margine;<note place="margin">The Governess returns the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with her Answer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexd.</note> wherein she gave them hope, that
the Inquisition should be taken away, and the Edicts moderated, onely she
must first acquaint the King with their desires. But because this did not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
them all;<note place="margin">Florence Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius C. Cuilenburg. William C. Bergen.</note> they withdrew to consult together, and having passed their
votes, came back, and in all their names <hi>Eustachius Fiennes</hi> Lord of <hi>Esquerd</hi>
(for <hi>Brederod</hi> durst not speak in publick, unless he had conn'd his Lesson, or
that he read it out of his Book) giving her Highness humble thanks for that
Answer, desired, that she would please to certifie, whatsoever had been done
at this meeting of the Gentry, was out of their dutie to the King, and for his
Majesties advantage. But the Governess expresly denying it, replyed, Time &amp;
their Actions would testify that sufficiently to all the world, and so left them.</p>
               <p>The same day <hi>Brederod</hi> entertained the Covenanters at <hi>Cuilenburg-house</hi>
and made them a great feast,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Brederod</hi> treats the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiratours.</note> but unfortunate to the very House where they
were feasted, which for this onely cause was afterward pulled down and
levelled with the earth. The invited were about three hundred, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
more confident,<note place="margin">In their cups, they would have a title of honour given to their Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, and the like to their Generall.</note> especially at the table in their jollity: Among other
passages, they put the question, how that Society should be named, and it
pleased them to give it the title of the <hi>Noble Concord:</hi> and they called their
<hi>Generall</hi> the <hi>Restorer of lost liberty.</hi> But these denominations after this feast
were never heard of. Perhaps, because they were of another mind when
they were sober, and rejected those titles, as lyable to envie and offence: or
perhaps, because a new and accidentall <hi>nickname</hi> was received with greater
successe, and easily cancelled all those former appellations. For <hi>Brederod</hi>
told <hi>Cuilenburg</hi> and <hi>Bergen,</hi> that he himself, and divers others which yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
stood near the Governesse, heard <hi>Charles</hi> Count <hi>Barlamont,</hi> whispering
in her ear,<note place="margin">What <hi>Gheuses</hi> signifies.</note> scoff at the assembled Nobilitie, and call them in <hi>French, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eux,</hi>
or as they pronounced it, <hi>Gheuses,</hi> using that word of disgrace to encourage
the Governesse, as if she needed not fear Beggars and Rogues. But signifie
what it would, they willingly accepted of the name, and for their King and
Countreys sake seemed content in good earnest to be <hi>Gheuses</hi> and <hi>Beggars.</hi>
Count <hi>Cuilenburg</hi> stomacked this exceedingly; and so did many more, that
either were not in the presence, or else heard not <hi>Barlamont</hi> when he spake it.
Notwithstanding they were pleased to call themselves by that name &amp; from<note place="margin">The Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters much taken with the name of <hi>Gheuses.</hi>

                     </gap>chstrat</hi> by chance coming in) they animated one another
by the name of <hi>Gheuses,</hi> and then calling for great bowls, drank a health to the
name, and happiness of the <hi>Gheuses,</hi> crying <hi>long live the GHEUSES.</hi> Lastly,
when they were rising,<note place="margin">Ensignes fit for the faction.</note> 
                  <hi>Brederod</hi> took a wallet that lay in the room, casting
it over his shoulder as beggars do: and holding a wooden dish in his hand,
full of wine, drank to all the company; and gave them thanks, for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to that day with such unanimous consent, and therefore, he doubted
not, but they would for the future continue in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For his own part, he would never be of other mind. Nay he took it
upon his honour, that he would die, if need should be, for the generality of
his Confederates, and for every particular person. At these words, they
doubled their acclamations, of, <hi>Long live the GHEUSES.</hi> Then <hi>Brederod</hi>
having taken off his dish, gave it and the wallet to his next neighbour, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41239:65"/>
so when it was gone round,<note place="margin">1566.</note> and every one had drunk <hi>Brederods</hi> health, and
repeating his words,<note place="margin">Their mutuall devotement.</note> had devoted their own lives for the rest of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
they rose from the table, and when the dish and the wallet were
come again to <hi>Brederod,</hi> he nailed them to the wall: and the rest following
his example, every one drave in his nail, and removing them, in a frolick,
round about the room, they were initiated with these ridiculous Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
At which time the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> and Count <hi>Horn</hi>
coming in from Count <hi>Mansfelds</hi> house,<note place="margin">They take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touch.</note> where they dined, they fell to their
cups afresh, &amp; as they drank about, the same wishes for the <hi>Gheuses</hi> were with
great shouts renewed. The particularities of this feast I had, out of private
letters and notes, which, upon this occasion were speedily conveighed to
the Governesse, by those that heard most of them from <hi>Sarnapulius Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>

well fudled, to make their clothes drink with them, cast wine upon one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
changed hats, and put them on, the crown downward (being turned

may easily be supposed in a multitude corrupted with abundance of friends

to the petitioners, as to a company of prodigall fools and rascals, which
they took upon them in their drink, and so styled their faction, with beastly
clamours, and such tricks as boyes would be ashamed of. Afterwards, it
was translated from their faction to their heresie, the next neighbour to it:
and made the proper name of the hereticall Rebells in the Low-countreys.
And as in <hi>France</hi> the hereticks are called <hi>Hugon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are known by the name of <hi>Gheuses.</hi> Nor did the drunkards so leave off,
but the same day, about evening, Grave <hi>Lewis,</hi> supping with his Brother
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> where <hi>Brederod</hi> was, with Count <hi>Horn,</hi> and many
more of the Covenanters; the whole house made the same wishes for the

                  <note place="margin">1568.</note> as two years after, Count <hi>Horn</hi> confessed, upon his examination
taken by the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Gheuses</hi> walk the streets.</note> Thus growing confident, they resolved, with
great pomp, to carry the name of <hi>Gheuses</hi> out of doors, to trie if the people
would be taken with the novitie. Perhaps they observed, that some of the
Lords approved of their proceedings: or perhaps, they hoped, what they had
done in private, would be commended, it may be applauded, if they did it
publickly,<note place="margin">Accoutred like beggars.</note> inserting the Kings name. Therefore the Covenanters, for some
dayes next following, walked the streets in ash-coloured cloth-suits. Some
of them wore little wooden cans, cups, or saucers (the beggars houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuff)
in their hats:<note place="margin">But with gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant <hi>Medals.</hi>
                  </note> some had this Impresse stamped in wax or wood, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

beards, leaving onely great mustachios, turned up like Turks; I suppose
their meaning was, to take away the contempt of their beggars clothes, by
the terrour of their upper lips, and to shew themselves at once both humble
and formidable. In the mean time, the City was full of doubts and news.
Many being glad the conspiracy went on, and hoping, by those tumults, and
the assistance of the Lords, to free themselves from the fear of the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Many onely looked on, as at a play, and were glad they had seats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

either out of devotion to the Mother of God, or in imitation (as it often

of his <hi>Pontifician</hi> power, gave to them that should have such Medalls, stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with the Image of any Saint, indulgence and pardon for their sinnes.
It is reported that (the devotion towards these kinde of figures increasing
in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and other orthodox countries, striving to follow the
<hi>Low-countrey mens</hi> example) the use of Medalls was upon this occasion,
brought into the Church, or at least, from hence they received their first

his departure from <hi>Bruxells,</hi> returned to the Governess, two daies after his last
address, to get his petition signed. There came along with him the Counts
of <hi>Bergen, Nassau,</hi> and <hi>Cuilenburg,</hi> heads to the faction of the <hi>Gheuses,</hi> and
they delivered a new petition,<note place="margin">Angered at the Governesses delay.</note> containing their old demands, onely with
these additionalls, That the delay of expecting the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
would be dangerous, in respect of the incensed and furious disposition
of the people. Truly they themselves, out of that affection they owed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Country, could not but acquaint her Highness, that the Low-country
mens violent desires, would questionless break out into insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Howsoever, if her Excellence were resolutely bent, to apply to such
an imminent danger, so slow and so remote a remedy, they called God
and men to witness, what mischief soever came of it, the Low-country
Nobility should not hereafter bear the blame.<note place="margin">She treates them with fair language.</note> But the Governess, nothing
moved withall this, promised to cut of all delayes, by sending speedily to
<hi>Spain;</hi> and all occasions of tumults, by giving instructions to the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
and Magistrates of Towns, to proceed with greater moderation.

draw in no new partisans, nor meet any more at private conventicles: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
she resolved to do her duty, in maintaining the Antient Religion, and
the Kings authority in those Provinces. Having received this answer,
many of the conspiratours took leave of the Governess, and presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the City, leaving spies behinde, to give intelligence to the

<hi>Antwerp</hi> flocked to the Inne,<note place="margin">Where the people come to him in multitudes.</note> where <hi>Brederod</hi> alighted with 43. horse, and
when he heard that such a multitude were come to the house, he rose from
dinner, and looking out of the window, with a great bowle of wine in his
hand, saluted them standing below in the yard, in these words, <hi>You of
Antwerp,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be their Generall.</note> 
                  <hi>here I am, that will, with the hazard of my life and fortunes, protect
your selves, and free your children from the tyranny of the Inquisition and the
Edicts. If your consent goes along with me in this glorious action, come on, and
as many of you as would have your liberties preserved, and mee for your Generall,
pledg me this bowle with a good heart, and hold up your hands, in taken that you
accept of my good will.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And is accepted.</note> Then he drank it off, and first held up his own hand,
instantly the most of them did the like, and lifting their hands with an
odd kinde of hum, signified, that they took it as an argument of his love;
and when he departed from the city, the same rabble brought him on his
way.</p>
               <p>The rest of the Covenanters were but newly returned to the towns from
whence they came,<note place="margin">The subtilty of the Gheuses slandering the Knights of the Golden Fleece with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of their faction. In a printed Declaration.</note> yet (lest they might seem to have carried their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to no purpose) they made it be reported through the Low-countreys
that their businesse was dispatched. And to that end, they counterfeited a
Declaration, subscribed by the Knights of the <hi>Golden-fleece,</hi> either to induce
the world to believe, that they were protected by the Knights, or to make
the Governesse jealous of the Order. The Declaration was thus penned.
<hi>The publick faith concluded upon, at</hi> Bruxels, <hi>by the Gentlemen of the League,
and signed by the Knights of the Order, the seventh of</hi> April 1566. <hi>We Lords
whose names are underwritten, having sworn by our Order, do promise to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
chosen by the Estates and legally sent into the City, that the Ecclesiasticall
Inquisitours, and the other Magistrates shall, from this day, punish no man for his
Religion, neither by Imprisonment, Exile, nor death; unless it be joyned with a
popular tumult and the ruine of our Countrey, of which crimes Be the Covenanters
the sole legall punishers. But this power of theirs onely to be in force till the King
with the consent of the Estates of the</hi> Low-countreys <hi>shall otherwise determine.</hi>
The news of this Declaration at first startled the Governesse, then she sent
for the <hi>Manifesto</hi> it self,<note place="margin">The Governesse is at first af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of this kind of Artifice.</note> and read it. For though she rationally conjectured,
that is was an impudent lie,<note place="margin">April 13.</note> invented by the Covenanters: yet she very
much feared it would be such a bait as might easily catch the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prone
to believe what they desire: or making a shew of believing, to colour their
delinquencie with an handsome excuse.<note place="margin">Which before it can come to be consuted leaves the impression of a wound.</note> At least she knew, that before the
trick could be discovered, many insolencies might be committed against
Religion, and the Kings Authority, which afterwards could never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
or rectified by any means or industrie. And truly many do spread
abroad such forgeries, not out of hope they will continue long concealed:
for they have their ends, if they last but till the people that are fooled with
them,<note place="margin">To which end such things pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</note> begin to pull the frame of the State in pieces, the Result whereof
will be, that when they come to see their errour, at the same time despairing
of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>don, licentiousnesse and love of sinne likewise increasing, they
raise one tumult upon the neck of another, cruell but cowardly: and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining

danger it self to be the best remedy for danger. Many indeed make
use of lies, as builders do of buttresses and scaffolds.<note place="margin">And serve the turn like tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary scaffolds till the building be up.</note> For as they are usefull
whilest Arches are in making, but when they be finished are cast away; so
the subtiller sort of people devise falsehoods, to no other end but to support
their Architecture a while, which if compleated and able to stand alone,
then they easily suffer their fictions to grow out of date, to be pulled down
and cast away, like props and scaffolds when the building is brought unto
perfection. And the Governess knowing it was now no time for delayes,<note place="margin">Atlast the Lords denying that any of their Order was ingaged.</note>
sent for as many of the Order as could conveniently attend her (for it was
Passion week, and the major part had retired themselves to make their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
in the Monasteries of their own Towns, according to the custome of
the Nobility) and shewed them the Declaration; upon sight whereof, Count
<hi>Egmont</hi> and Count <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> who were the first that came, protested, that
no part of it was either done or said by their Companions of the Order.
It was therefore resolved, that expedition should be used whilst the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
had onely a tast of the Errour,<note place="margin">She gives notice of the deceit to the Provinces.</note> but had not as yet swallowed down the
Falsehood; and that they should not expect till the wooll dipt in Ink, were
made uncapable of another die. That the Governours of the Provinces,
and the Magistrate of every City and Town, should be immediately inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the truth; and a copy sent them of the Petition presented by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters,
with the Governesses marginall Answer. They were likewise to
take notice, that if any thing else were published by any whatsoever, it was
to be reputed as the Invention of some seditious persons, endeavouring to
beget domestick Tumults, and accordingly by the Kings Laws, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to be punished. These Letters, though presently sent into the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">April 25.</note>
yet failed to undeceive the people:<note place="margin">Whereupon she dispatches an Embassage for <hi>Spain,</hi> nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Marq. of <hi>Bergen,</hi>
                  </note> which in many places had already
heard and believed the untruth,<note place="margin">But not timely enough to all Places.</note> to the great prejudice (as I shall presently
shew you) of the ancient Religion, and the Publick peace. Which forced
the Governess to hasten the Embassie into <hi>Spain,</hi> that was lately voted by the
Senate. <hi>Iohn Glimè</hi> Marquess of <hi>Bergen</hi> and Governour of <hi>Haynolt</hi> was
named for the imployment. But he, whether his guilty conscience could
not brook the Kings presence, or whether the trouble of the voyage frighted
him, at first refused to undertake it; then was willing, so that another might
be put in Commission with him; <hi>Florence Momorancie</hi> Lord of <hi>Montiny</hi>
was therefore joyned with the Marquesse.<note place="margin">And the Lord <hi>Montiny.</hi>
                  </note> Both of them, because they
doubted their business would not please the King, were suiters to the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness,</hi>
to dispatch away a Messenger into <hi>Spain,</hi> that should prepare his
Majestie with the knowledge of their coming: in the interim, they resolved
so to order and spin out their journey, that the Messenger should meet them
upon the way, with the Kings Letters: wherein they might perceive if his
Majestie approved of their imployment. Notwithstanding all this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which their ill-presaging minds rather used for their security,
then for their Honour, they escaped not, but this Embassage cost
them both their lives. They had yet other unlucky Omens; for two
dayes before they set forth, the Marquess of <hi>Bergen,</hi> as he walked in
the open Court of the Governesse's Palace, was hit upon the thigh
with a Ball of wood, by some playing at Pall Mall; and being very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
hurt, kept his bed, and was constrained to deferre his journey.
You would think, this good office was done him by his <hi>Genius,</hi> who not
contented by other warnings to have pulled him by the ear, now laid him by
the heels,<note place="margin">1. montiny sets for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what Fate hath ordained for every man, is not so easily prevented, as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41239:67"/>
In the mean while, the Governesse (it concerning her to loose no
time) got the other Embassadour, though against his will, to go before the
Marquesse of <hi>Bergen</hi> (who should follow as soon as he recovered) and to
acquaint his Majestie with the state of affairs in the Low-countreys, after
the Gentlemens petition was delivered. To this purpose, besides letters,
instructions, and other appendents to an Embassage, her Excellence gave
him a Book containing in eighteen chapters the principle actions of that
year, which she left to his Majesties consideration; and concluded, that
onely his presence would, with the least hazard, settle the Low-countreys.
Yet before his departure, the Governesse (as she had promised her two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours)
sent away <hi>Fabius Lembus a Neopolitan,</hi> an old Courtier,<note place="margin">A Messenger, with private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, goes before him.</note> and
faithfull; with private commands, and notes, wherein she interpreted most
of that which she had given in charge to <hi>Montiny.</hi> She sent likewise a copy
of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth's Edicts somewhat qualifyed in the penalties against. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
by advice of the Senatours and Divines; likewise signifying, that
she had shewed that qualification severally to the Estates of the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
and that by most of them it was approved of; yet that she would not
publish it, nor propound it to the People, without his Majesties consent: but
she earnestly beseeched him, to command it; and to deferre his intention of
establishing the <hi>Popes</hi> Inquisitours. So on the seventeenth of May, she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
<hi>Fabius Lembus</hi> thus instructed. In ten dayes after, <hi>Montiny</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the seventeenth of June was by the King gratiously received at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi>
and divers times had Audience. Yet before he could get a determinate
Answer, he was commanded to exspect his fellow Commissioner, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
of <hi>Bergen:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King gives no dispatch to the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</note> nor found he the King inclinable to, or well pleased with
his Embassage. Indeed to divert his Majestie from consenting to the Low-countreymens
desires (though he was of himself sufficiently constant both
to Religion, and his opinions) <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth interposed his authoritie: by
whose <hi>Nuncio,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pope mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to revenge the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front offered to Religion.</note> 
                  <hi>Pedro Camaiono</hi> Bishop of <hi>Asculum</hi> (who had an eye upon
that Embassie from the Low-countreys) his Majestie was continually so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
not to suffer the Catholick Religion to fall in the Low-countreys;
but that he would personally by force of arms, punish the disloyaltie of that
turbulent people.<note place="margin">Who likewise sends his Legate to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernesse.

to take the Low-countreys in his way: and in his name to set a high

in her Government of the <hi>Low-countreys;</hi> wherein he should incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
her, by promising supplies of money from the <hi>Pope,</hi> with his utmost
assistance. For now a Cause was controverted, for which he would not
fear to stake his triple Crown.<note place="margin">Delivering his letters to Count <hi>Cuilemburg</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  </note> Moreover, he was to advise with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernesse,
about delivering the Popes letters to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and
Count <hi>Cuilemburg,</hi> exhorting the Count to forsake the Hereticks, unto
whom, it was said, he adhered, and to reconcile himself to the old Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and admonishing the Prince not to suffer with impunity so many foul
things,<note place="margin">She advises him not to give the letter to the Count, But to let the Prince have his, whom she undertakes to prepare.</note> as were committed by Hereticks in his Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> to the
great dammage of all the neighbouring Cities,<note place="margin">Decem. 15. 1563.</note> especially <hi>Avignion.</hi> But the
Governesse, whose counsell the Legate was commanded to follow, did not
approve of the delivery of the <hi>Popes</hi> letters to <hi>Cuilemburg,</hi> least, as he was a
youth of a weak and fantasticall brain, he might not value or receive them
with due reverence. She said, he might safelier treat with the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
in regard the like admonition, formerly sent from <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, had
struck him with a fear of loosing his Principality, neverthelesse she would
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41239:67"/>
prepare him for the Legate. But for his liberall offer of assistance from his
<hi>Holinesse,</hi> she acknowledged her obligations to the great <hi>Bishop,</hi> and desired
<hi>Pavesio</hi> to represent her, for that favour, kneeling at his feet, and humbly
kissing them: though she had not power to admit of his promised supplies,<note place="margin">In the mean time excuses her self for not receiving the money offered by the Pope. Her Excellence gives the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Low-countrey Bishops.</note>
unlesse the King would please to give her leave. But she assured his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
that the Cause of Religion should be alwayes to her, as it had ever
been, dearer then her life. Lastly, touching the nature and industry of
the Low-countrey <hi>Bishops</hi> (for <hi>Pavesio</hi> intreated her to instruct him in that
particular) she very graphically discoursed their lives and manners, and
gave him their severall characters, telling which deserved Rebuke, which
Praise or Pitie. The Legate, finding all she said to be true, and the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> the easier to be wrought upon, (belike her Excellence had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
him, as she promised) admiring her industrie and pietie,<note place="margin">Who is amazed at her Piety and Prudence.</note> professed that
he would publish in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> how Religion standing now in the
Low-countreys on a dangerous precipice, was supported onely by her
Highnesses vigilance and prudence. But the Factions and Tumults ceased
not for all this.<note place="margin">The impudence of the <hi>Gheuses</hi> incouraged by hope of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> The Covenanters being returned (as I have told you) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their respective Provinces, and giving it out, that they had the publick
Faith of the Knights of the Golden Fleece for their indemnitie; all those
that had been banished for heresie came back from the adjacent Countreys,
and such as had lyen concealed at home appeared again, magnifying the
name of the <hi>Gheuses,</hi> calling them the Assertours and Champions of their
libertie, and putting themselves under their protection.<note place="margin">Their new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy.</note> Thus the number
of the Covenanters was much increased, especially in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> even the
Merchants themselves began to wear the <hi>Habit</hi> aud Cognizante of the <hi>Gheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
Nay there sprung up a new-brotherhood of the Common People,
wearing in their hats, besides the wallet stampt in silver, a wreathed pilgrims
staff,<note place="margin">And new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion.</note> the ends bowing acrosse, signifying (as I suppose) that they were to
go a pilgrimage out of their Countrey, and seek libertie in another Climate.
This conspiracie was spawned out of the other, it being the off-spring (as
the Governesse wrote to his Majestie) of that two years before,<note place="margin">The Originall of these kind of confederacies.</note> raised by the
Lords against <hi>Cardinall Granvel,</hi> where they first wore hoods, and then
Darts.<note place="margin">May 17.</note> But that which at the beginning was onely private difference at
Court, and the ambition of a few, afterwards turned into the publick mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
of the Provinces. Great men, it seems, never can offend alone; and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whilst they passe from hand to hand, are soyled with being touched,
and grow still fouler. Neither did the Governesses letters to the Magistrates,<note place="margin">Not cured ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernesses care.</note>
concerning the counterfeit Declaration in the Lords names,<note place="margin">6. or 21. of May.</note> do any good:
nor the Kings letter to the Governesse and the Provinces, about that time
received, wherein his Majestie promised, That having now secured himself
from the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> he would presently make a voyage into the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Or by the Kings letter gracious indeed.</note>
and in person moderate the severitie (if any such were) of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Edicts. In the mean time, he rested confident that the troubles would
be quieted by the Lords endeavours, whereupon formerly relying, both his
father the Emperour and he himself never feared what their enemies could
do:<note place="margin">March 15.</note> and now,<note place="margin">But unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly protracting the Grant of Generall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons to some great ones.</note> he doubted not but their old loyalty would easily compose

<hi>interim,</hi> the evil increasing, and the opportunitie of applying a fit remedie
being past, his Majestie lost the Grace and favour he intended.</p>
               <p>And truly mischiefs sprung not up severally, or by intervals; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41239:68"/>
and in a knot,<note place="margin">1566.</note> breaking forth all at once. For in the bordering
Countreys the Master-hereticks watching how discord prospered in the
<hi>Low-countreys,</hi> that they might take occasion to vent their outlandish wares
and sell them the new Gospel; flocking in crouds, the <hi>Calvinists</hi> out of

likewise that if differences chanced to be composed, they should fail of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching
what they came for; they thought it best,<note place="margin">Then openly preaching.</note> by way of prevention,
to shew themselves in the light; and before the people (that ran to meet

worsted by the <hi>Calvinists:</hi> or that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> should have more great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectours
then both the other Sects. Therefore they made haste in zeal of
spirit to feiz upon Cities and Towns, as if they were to make new planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
every one being for himself,<note place="margin">Catholicks.</note> and all against One. Miserable and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous
at that time was the condition of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> many of the
noblest Provinces being suddenly hurried into factions,<note place="margin">What they were that came in. Infinite Resort to hear them.</note> and running upon
the rocks of errour. Whilst impure men, Apostates both from divine and

and <hi>France,</hi> promised themselves a kind of sovereignty in the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi>
and ran up and down as if hell had been broke loose, filling all
places with turbulent sermons, infamous libells, hopes, fears, and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.
Whilst such a multitude; first out of the next villages, but at last out
of great towns, came, with incredible desire, to hear these trumpeters of
the new Gospel; that once, in the fields of <hi>Tournay</hi> above eight thousand
men were seen at a sermon. Near <hi>Lisle</hi> they appeared in greater shoals. At
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> in one day, were gathered together thirteen thousand, next day
fourteen thousand,<note place="margin">And to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments after the hereticall way.</note> a while after sixteen thousand men. Lastly, taking more
freedome in many places, especially at <hi>Valenciens</hi> and upon the borders of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> they married people in the fields, and baptized infants after the
<hi>Calvinisticall</hi> manner. And that all this might be done with safety, they
meet at these Conventicles and Sermons, armed with pikes and muskets. I
know the Reader will not a little wonder to hear (what they say the Low-treymen
themselves were amazed when they saw) how the People<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>News was brought, that the Confederate <hi>Gheuses</hi> had a new designe, and

with the chief of the Covenanters, wrote Letters to the Towns about
them, in the end of <hi>Iune,</hi> summoning them to convene the 14 day of <hi>Iuly.

Bishop excusing himself, as bound by the Imperiall Laws, not to suffer any
such meeting in an Imperiall Town; wrote all that had passed, in cypher, to
the Governess, and commanded the Governour of the Town, not to admit
them if they came. But the Townsmen fearing,<note place="margin">But the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men let them in.</note> that if they did shut their

the last day of that moneth) two things were put to the question: The
first, How they should be secured, in case the King were minded to revenge
himself upon them: and then, Whether they should move for more, then
was expressed in their Petition delivered in <hi>April,</hi> touching the Edicts and
Inquisition.<note place="margin">Where they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously agree to petition for their Indemnity.</note> The generall vote was, that security should be demanded of
the Governess; but the other passed in the negative: some affirming that
upon the grant of those particulars for which they took the Covenant, they
ought to proceed no farther. Others said, That if they had success in their
first Petition, they would enlarge it, and desire, that no certain form of
Religion might be prescribed the people; but that every one might be left
free, to serve God his own way.<note place="margin">Touching Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Religion they differ among themselves.</note> Many were extreamly offended with that
abominable opinion, and thereupon by degrees disengaged themselves from
the Covenant (among which was <hi>Charles Mansfeld</hi> sonne to Count <hi>Ernest</hi>)
so as nothing was determined in that point.<note place="margin">A few Pages lower.</note> But whether the Hereticks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

fright the Covenanters and these Assemblies; not that she was ignorant, how

confidence, and by making them of Counsel with her, she might oblige
them, and put it in their power to set things right, and consequently to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the Kings favour. They appointed <hi>Brederod</hi> and the heads of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters

that by their authoritie with the Commons they should restrain them

<hi>Brederod</hi> wrote the heads of this conference (which were

were preparing against them. Moreover, that she would give Commission
to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> and Count <hi>Horn</hi> to hear the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the Covenanters, and to mediate betwixt his Majestie and them.
Lastly, they moved for a generall Convention of the Estates, as the best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
for restoring peace to their Countrey. Otherwise, though against
their wills, they must be necessitated to have recourse to forrein help. These
letters being read in Senate,<note place="margin">She puts them off for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</note> after every man had delivered his opinion,
the Governesse answered <hi>Lewis</hi> and his companions (that were called, by

that the Citizens had been earnest with him to receive the Government of

consenting to it, he not onely raised men, but was so bold, as to ask
leave to have a Guard about his person, which she likewise granted. And
so to his great contentment he was made Governour, meaning shortly to
make himself an absolute Prince, by the too much indulgence of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernesse,</hi>

way.</p>
               <p>And indeed that destruction (which I think was one of the greatest that

think by many letters I have read, that in all probability it came thither
from the <hi>Geneva Calvinists,</hi> their next <hi>French</hi> neighbours: perhaps by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
perhaps upon design; for so <hi>Peter Ernest</hi> Count <hi>Mansfeld</hi> informed the
Governesse, and she the King. The very same intelligence she received from
<hi>Pedro Ceballio,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August 28.</note> an old <hi>Spanish</hi> Commander, who assured her, that the Prince
of <hi>Condegrave;</hi> and the three brothers of the <hi>Colygn</hi> the heads of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What forreiners incouraged them.</note>
to advance their own partie in <hi>France</hi> while Heresie reigned in the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi>
by their Emissaries, dayly solicited the Hereticks in these Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to make some attempt, wherein they promised sufficiently to furnish
them with men and Arms. The like hope they had of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
This agrees with what was resolved upon at <hi>Centron</hi> by the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<hi>Gheuses,</hi> in which number the Admirall of <hi>France</hi> and others of that
nation being comprehended, it was easie for them, upon this occasion, to
trouble the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi> Besides these mysteries of State,<note place="margin">Why the Low-countreymen joyned with them.</note> other things were
plain to be discerned. For the people, partly corrupted with Heresie, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dreading the Inquisition, exceedingly favoured the Hereticks that sought
to overthrow that judicature. The confederated <hi>Gheuses</hi> willingly took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them the protection of the Commons, because many of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were birds of the same feather, and all of them ambitious to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Tribunes of the people. The Knights of the Order, and the Lords,
were divided among themselves. Those that continued faithfull to their
Religion and their Prince, were the weaker party: the stronger either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
themselves for the Conspiratours, or at least were of their chamber-counsell.
And now the Governesse wrote to the King,<note place="margin">August 28.</note> that she had certain
knowledge of the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> design, by those tumults to invade the
Government of the <hi>Low-countreys:</hi> and share it with his fellow-rebells.
Therefore, upon Assumption-eve,<note place="margin">The day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Picture-scuffle. The Place.</note> they began to rifle the <hi>Low-countrey</hi>
Churches: first rising in the lower <hi>Flanders,</hi> which lies between the river
<hi>Lys</hi> and the West Sea. In these parts a few of the raskall sort of Hereticks
met and joyned themselves with some companies of thieves,<note place="margin">The quality of the Image-breakers. Their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> upon the day
appointed for proclaiming warre against heaven, lead on by no Commander
but Impietie: their Arms were staves, hatchets, hammers, and ropes, fitter
to pull down houses, then to fight withall: some few of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had swords
and muskets.<note place="margin">First the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages are plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> Thus accoutered, as if they had been furies vomited from
Hell, they broke into the towns and villages about S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Omer,</hi> and if they
found the doors of Churches or Monasteries shut, forced them open,
frighting away their religious inhabitants: and overturning the Altars, they
defaced the Monuments of Saints, and broke to peices their sacred images.
Whatsoever they saw dedicated to God, and to the Blessed, they pulled it
down and trod it under their feet to dirt, whilst their Ringleaders clapt them

                  <note place="margin">Then the Cities.</note>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:41239:71"/>
The Hereticks glad of this successe to the first that ever they sent out upon a
party, left the place with speed, and with unanimous consent, shouted and
cryed aloud, <hi>Let us to IPRES,</hi> that being a citie much frequented by the
<hi>Calvinists.</hi> And they were drawn thither, as well out of hope of protection,
as out of hatred they bare to the Bishop of that City, <hi>Martin Rithovius,</hi> an
eminently virtuous and learned man, and therefore meriting the spleen of
Hereticks. Whereupon they ran violently thither, gathering upon the way
such vagabonds and beggars, as joyned with them out of hope of plunder.
And as a snow ball rolling from the top of a hill, grows still greater, by
the accesse of new snow, through which it passes, and wherein it is involved:
so these thievish vagabonds multiplying by the way, the farther they go,
the more they rage, and the more considerable their thievish strength ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.<note place="margin">They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Ipres.</hi>
                  </note>
And when they had pillaged a few small villages about <hi>Ipres,</hi> upon
the very day of the Assumption of the blessed Virgin, the citizens of <hi>Ipres</hi>
opening their gates unto them,<note place="margin">Deface and pillage the great Church.</note> they entered the town, and went directly to
the Cathedrall Church, where every one fell to work. Some set ladders to
the walls, with hammers and slaves battering the pictures. Others broke
a sunder the iron work, seats, and pulpit. Others, casting ropes about the
great statues of our Saviour Christ, and the Saints, pulled them down to
the ground. Others stole the consecrated plate, burnt the sacred Books, and
stript the Altars of their holy ornaments: and that, with so much securitie,
with so little regard of the Magistrate or Prelates, as you would think they
had been sent for by the common Councell, and were in pay with the citie.
With the same fury they likewise burned the Bishop of <hi>Ipre's</hi> library,<note place="margin">Burn the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary. Violate all things sacred.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the rest of the Churches and Religious nouses of the town, react<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their villanies, and because the first prospered, still presuming. This
sacrilegious robbery continued a whole day.<note place="margin">The People, and the Magistrate, diversly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</note> Part of the people being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
to see them, not taking them for men, but devils in humane shapes:
and part rejoycing, that now those things were done which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had long ago designed. Nor had the Magistrate and Senatours any
greater care of Religion. Perhaps this sudden inundation took away
their sense and judgement; perhaps, being privy to the plot, they,
idle and carelesse, kept their houses. Indeed the whole Citie fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
like passengers in a Shipwrack, beheld the destruction, never put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to their helping hands.<note place="margin">A new Party of Image-breakers in other Towns.</note> The next day, another party of Church-robbers,
either kept for a reserve, or taking example by what was done about
<hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Omer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Omer,</note> had orders to plunder <hi>Menin, Commines, Vervich,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Menin, Commines, Vervich.</note> and other
Towns upon the <hi>Lys,</hi> which they did with the like violence. All things
holy that were portable they carried away: the rest they cut in pieces and
burned. Thence passing the River, they came within the Liberties of <hi>Lisle,</hi>
many of the Townsmen joyning with them; and having robbed a rich Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
which they call <hi>Marquet,</hi> mad and drunk, some went to <hi>Doway,</hi>
some to <hi>Seclin:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Encountred by the <hi>Secliners.</hi>
                  </note> But the <hi>Secliners</hi> and other neighbour Towns, catching up
any weapon that came to hand, faced them upon their march, and shewed
themselves ready to punish the injury offered to Religion, unless those thieves
would take another way.<note place="margin">And defeated.</note> But they with the same impudence, striving to go
forward, and to break through them, the Countrey came in, and falling
upon them, slew a great sort, and routed the rest, making them flie in great
distraction, forcing many into the boggs, drowing some in the river, and
carrying others into the Town in triumph. But this was a slight revenge:
when at the same time, almost all <hi>Flanders</hi> did as furiously assault God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and all his Saints, no man resisting. The news whereof much afflicted
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41239:71"/>
the Governess, who, in great grief of heart, turning to Count <hi>Egmont,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Governess's words to Count <hi>Egmont.</hi>
                  </note> that
waited on her from the Sermon to her Privie-chamber, said, <hi>Do you hear,</hi>
Egmont, <hi>what good news comes from your Province of</hi> Flanders? <hi>Unhappy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that I am, to see in the time of my Government, such indignities offered to
God, and to the King. And will you, in whose worth and fidelity his Majestie hath
alwayes put such confidence, suffer these foul villanyes to passe unpunished, in the
Province committed to your charge?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Answer.</note> and when he answered, <hi>That in the first
place the Kings Authority must be carefully maintained, and then Religion would
easily be restored;</hi> the Governess not without indignation replied,<note place="margin">Her reply.</note> that <hi>his
counsel was not just; but rather before all humane things, the honour and worship of
God ought to be preferred, the neglect whereof would be a farre greater misery,
then the losse of any power or fortune whatsoever. This was her opinion, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Kings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Rejoynder.</note> 
                  <hi>who resolved to put nothing in ballance with Religion.</hi> And when
<hi>Egmont</hi> added, <hi>That men were of another mind, who had estates in these Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which they feared to loose:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her Conclusion.</note> she concluded with the same constancie, that
<hi>it was indeed to be wished, and would be a more prudent course; to preserve both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and temporall Power: but if one of them must go to wrack, the safetie of
Religion ought principally to be respected; which, once lost, would never be repaired
with the addition either of Wealth or Empire.</hi> To this purpose her Excellence
spake in Senate also,<note place="margin">The Senates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution upon the Exigent.</note> which she speedily summoned. Wherein it was decreed,
that <hi>Maximil. Rassinghem,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Iohn Currier</hi> deceased, in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>French Flanders,</hi> should immediately enter <hi>Lisle</hi> with the horse
commanded by the Lord <hi>Montiny,</hi> who was then in <hi>Spain,</hi> and not suffer
the people, that had been plundering consecrated Goods, to return into the
town, before they had yeilded up their Arms, and that he had carried them
to the Magazine. And notwithstanding <hi>Egmont</hi> did not well approve of this
kind of proceeding, but affirmed, that if the Governess went by the way
of Arms, this Insurrection would not be quieted, till 200000 men hast lost
their lives, yet she gave not off her resolution, but answered, <hi>It were better
that Roat, the dregs of mankind (if they would not renounce their heresie) should be
banished or destroyed, then they should be suffered to commit such execrable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
lest the good men of the</hi> Low-countreys <hi>should, at length, either be infected
with their contagion, or forced by them to flie their Countrey, in case the multitude
prevailed.</hi>

upon the day of the Assumption of our Lady (for the <hi>Antwerpers</hi> have the
Blessed Virgin for their Patroness) whilst her Image in solemn Procession,
was carried upon mens shoulders, from the great Church, through the
streets, the symptomes of that disease appeared, which brake forth soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Some jeering rascals of the meaner sort of Artificers,<note place="margin">Mockerie.</note> first laughed and
hissed at the holy Solemnitie: then impiously and impudently, with mimick
salutations and reprochfull words, mockt the Effigies of the mother of God,
and had presumed to lay sacrilegious hands upon it, but that by the care of
those that ordered the Procession, it was set down, not (as was usuall) in the
middle-Isle of the Church, but speedily conveyed into the Quire. And next
day (for base people grow bolder if they find themselves feared) many came
into the Church, and some playing their gambols before our Ladies Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
asked her in scorn, why she had so early flown up to the roust. Others
ran about the great Church, threatning the Altars and Images; among
whom an impudent Rogue, a Sadler, got up into the Pulpit, and when this
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41239:72"/>
impious Mimick had counterfeited the tone and gesture of a Preacher, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
them to reach him a Bible,<note place="margin">And quarrelling in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Church.</note> he challenged any of the Catholick Priests
to come and dispute with him: and whilst they received him on the one side
with applauses, and on the other with casting faggot-sticks and rubbish at
him (which he threw at his audience again) at length the scuffle increasing,
as if they had been in the streets, a Catholick Spipper, not able to endure
the insolence of the fellow, ran up the side of the Pulpit, and catching the
Buffon about the waste, lustily tossed him over to the ground; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in the heat of the brawl, avoiding many blows made at him, was shot
in the arm with a pistol-bullet, the rest, when some cryed, that the Officers
were coming for fear of being taken, slipped out of the Church. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the quarrell continued, and they met every day, like Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
upon the stage,<note place="margin">Whereof the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious people, shutting out the rest, possest themselves.</note> to cut and hack one another. Untill upon the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
<hi>August,</hi> the Hereticks increasing in their number, came into the great Church
with concealed weapons; as if they resolved, after some light skirmishes for
a few dayes past, to come now to a battel. And expecting till Even-song
was done, they shouted with a hideous cry, <hi>Long live the Gheuses;</hi> Nay, they
commanded the Image of the Blessed Virgin to repeat their Acclamation,
which if she refused to do, they madly swore they would beat and kill her.
And though <hi>Iohn Immercellius</hi> Pretour of the Town, with some Appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
came and commanded them to keep the Peace, yet he could not help
it; but the people running away to get out of the tumult, the Hereticks shut
the doors after them, and as Conquerours possessed themselves of the
Church: Now when they saw all was theirs; hearing the clock strike the
last houre of the day,<note place="margin">And singing Psalmes fall to work.</note> and darkness adding confidence, one of them (lest
their wickedness should want formality) began to sing a <hi>Geneva</hi> Psalme, and
then, as if the Trumpet had sounded a charge, the Spirit moving them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they fell upon the effigies of the Mother of God, and upon the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of Christ and his Saints,<note place="margin">Breaking all things consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> some tumbled them down, and trod upon
them; others thrust swords into their sides; others chopped off their heads
with axes; with so much concord and forecast in their Sacriledge, that you
would think every one had his severall work assigned him. For the very
harlots,<note place="margin">And defacing the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall.</note> those common appurtenances to thieves and drunkards, catching up
the wax-candles from the Altars, and from the Vestry, held them to light
the men that were at work. Part whereof, getting upon the Altars cast
down the sacred plate, broke a sunder the picture-frames, defaced the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
walls: Part, setting up ladders, shattered the goodly Organes, broke the
windows flourished with a new kind of paint. Huge statues of Saints, that
stood in the walls upon Pedistalls, they unfastened and hurled down among
which, an ancient and great Crucifix, with the two thieves hanging on each
hand of our Saviour, that stood right against the high Altar, they pulled
down with ropes, and hewed it in pieces; but touched not the two theives,
as if they onely worshipped them, and desired them to be their good Lords.
Nay,<note place="margin">O Profane!</note> they presumed to break open the Conservatory of the celestial bread;
and putting in their polluted hands, to pull out the blessed Body of our
Lord, those base off-scourings of men, trod upon the Deity adored and
dreaded by the Angels. The Pixes and Chalices which they found in the
Vestry, they filled with wine prepared for the Altar, and drank them off in
derision. They greased their shooes with the Chrisme or holy oyl; and after
the spoyl of all these things, laughed and were very merry at the matter.
My meaning is not, lest I should scandalize mankind, nor suits it with Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to repeat all the foul actions wherewith in this destruction of holy things,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41239:72"/>
these traitours to God and his Saints glutted their cruelty.<note place="margin">What a great stately Church was this.</note> But the greatest
wonder was, to see them make so quick dispatch: that one of the fairest and
greatest Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How small a number defaced it.</note> full of Pictures and Statues, richly adorned
with about seventy Altars, by a few men (for they were not above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
as the Governess wrote to the King, that she was certainly informed)
should before midnight,<note place="margin">In a few houres.</note> when they began but in the evening, have nothing
at all left entire or unprofaned. Truly, if the hundred men had not an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
hands apiece, that in so short a space demolished such a multitude of
things,<note place="margin">Some thought the Devil helpt his Children.</note> it is not unreasonable to believe (which I know some at that time
suspected) that devils mixing with them, joyned in dispatching their own
work; or at least that the furious violence, which (in scorn of Religion)
stript the Altars, mangled the Statues and Pictures, defaced the tombes, and
in foure houres time robbed and layed waste so rich and goodly a Church;
could not have any other cause, but the immediate impulsion of those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
and infernall spirits, that add both rage and strength to sacrilegious
villains,<note place="margin">Because none of the Sacrilegious were so much as hurt in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</note> offering an acceptable sacrifice to hell. Especially because in such
a hurry and crowd of hasty labourers, whilst they run about the Church
like <hi>Bacchanals</hi> and Bedlams; whilst they mount the rounds of their lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
whilst they with great pains loosen the brasse and marble; whilst they
endeavour to spoil and steal the richest things; none of all their number had
so much as a fall, or a knock, though such loads of stone and wood came
tumbling down, and so many fragments and splinters flew about; nor recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the least hurt by the workmens tools, which they ran with in their
hands: it is no slight argument (as I said before) to prove that by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
the Devil was the Surveyour of their works, and by the assistance
of his evil Angels, that enterprise, no less difficult then impious, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
without harm to any of them, and therefore prodigiously ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>But these sacrilegious thieves committed yet more villanie in the Town,<note place="margin">From the Church they fall upon the City.</note>
presuming upon their fortune: For running out of the Church with hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
candles,<note place="margin">And their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber encreasing,</note> triumphantly singing and crying, <hi>Vive le Gueux;</hi> they were
received by others that had lien concealed near the Church, exspecting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
from the success. Their Companies therefore joyning (for
Bootie invited them)<note place="margin">Plunder all the Churches,</note> still as they came to any Church-doors, they broke
them open, spoyling and carrying away all their consecrated furniture. They
climbed into <hi>Monasteries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And Religious Houses in the Town, With incredible security.</note> searched them, entred their store-houses, seized
upon their meat, drank off their wine, and took from them all their money,
plate, and wardrobes, both sacred and profane. And this impiety was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with such impudence and impunitie; that truly I knovv not vvel, vvhether
the Reader vvill conceive more indignation against those impious Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that vvithout any reverence to God or man, plundred consecrated
places, and other mens houses at their pleasure, destroying and steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Church-ornaments, and Religious mens goods; or against such as
ought to have protected those sacred things,<note place="margin">Terrifying the Inhabitants. The Merchants keep their own houses, and there stand upon their guard.</note> and against the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Houses themselves, that looked on, whilst these Rogues with pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
hands abused and profaned all. But fear had possessed the generalitie,
this hapning about midnight, when the Citie was in their dead sleep, and
so the more affrighted, being awaked with sudden and severall kinds
of Out-cryes. And therefore, as unexspected and doubtfull accidents ever
strike the greatest terrour,<note place="margin">Those that had the custodie of things sacred, run away from their charge.</note> many of the Merchants, fearing an universall
plunder, shut their doors, and barricadoed them. The Clergie, knowing
themselves unable to resist a multitude of thieves (not discerning how few
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41239:73"/>
they were) forsook the Churches,<note place="margin">Religious men dare not appear. All the Town in a fright.</note> and provided for their own safetie. Nor
had the religious Orders time to collect their spirits in this common trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
when so many fled. In a word men had no more consideration to
defend themselves against this misfortune, then against a thunderbolt, which
every one wishes to avoid, but none labours to oppose,<note place="margin">The Nuns flie to their fathers Houses.</note> But the poor <hi>Nuns</hi>
were in the greatest fright and amazement, whose Cloysters were broke by
these Hobgoblins, which making havock of all things in their way, and
prying into every secret corner; whilst their furie or theivery kept them
imployed, it was the onely preservation of the holy Virgins, that getting on
their clothes of any fashion, escaped these sacrilegious dogs, and fled most
of them into their Parents houses. By which means, lesse mischief was
done, then uses to be committed in night-robberies. Their principall aim
being to make haste,<note place="margin">The Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous make but one nights work of it.</note> and ruine all things in an instant. And truly their hast
was so great, that the noblest Churches and Religious houses of <hi>Antwerp</hi>
were profaned and pillaged by the severall parties of these infamous Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls.
Nay, when it was day light, and that they saw the citie, amazed with
sudden fear,<note place="margin">Both Catholicks and Hereticks conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of mutuall distrust.</note> had made no preparation to suppresse them: for both Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
and Hereticks kept within doors; those fearing the Hereticks, which
they believed to be masters of the Town: and these, in regard they knew
the odium of the fact would reflect upon themselves, and therefore feared
the Justice of the Magistrate, and to be assailed by the Catholicks: but all
were of opinion, the libertie taken by these base Artificers, depended upon
some superiour causes;<note place="margin">The Church-robbers plunder with more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnesse then before.</note> the Church-robbers secured by other mens
terrour, fell to plunder in the day time, returning to the Churches and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,
unworthily and basely fouling the pure ornaments with their filthy
souls and bodies; and buttering the Books in the library, set them on fire.
Then in mockerie, arming the Saints statues, they ran a tilt, and overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, insulted over them. And every where like Conquerours, having
as well surprised, Religion as the Town, they bore the spoils in triumph.<note place="margin">The Pillage continues for three whole dayes together. At last the drowsie Citizens awake.</note>
Three dayes together in <hi>Antwerp</hi> lasted that spoil and destruction of things
sacred: with so great a losse of rare pieces, drawn by the hands of Masters,
that some writers stick not to say, the great Church alone was damnified to
the value of four hundred thousand Ducats. But it being strongly suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that after the spoil of Churches, hope of prey having multiplyed this
wicked rabble, they would at last plunder the rich Merchants (as many
times men fight more eagerly for their houses, then for their Altars) the
Townsmen thinking it their best, no longer to stand neuters, especially
perceiving the small number of these Rogues,<note place="margin">And taking Arms, Fright away the Sacrilegious.</note> appeared at their doors in
arms, and (as if they meant to revenge the Commonwealth) shut up all
the Ports but one, out of which that damned pack of villains ran, and
poured out their furie upon the adjoyning towns and villages, where they
exercised the same kind of sacrilegious freeboot.</p>

Ministers and Elders of the Hereticks communicated all their Counsels, and
that he carried in his hand the spoil of Churches and religious Houses; and
by this means, that turbulent spirited desperate man hoped, to levie warre
against the King. And it is evident, that <hi>Lewis</hi> was one of the first movers
in all the Sacriledge committed: it was by his incouragement, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

To what condition the <hi>Low-countreys</hi> are brought,<note place="margin">Her Speech.</note> by the wickedness of a few
men, we see, the absent will hear, and posterity admire, to my great disparagement
and yours. For I know many things will be imputed to me, Princes names being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
registred in the Kalender of publick calamities: and you are famed for so
many noble actions at home and abroad, that your names cannot possibly be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Nor were the <hi>Netherlands</hi> so intrusted to me, but that you had your parts in
the Administration of the Government. The particular Provinces committed to
your trust; the Order of the <hi>Golden-Fleece,</hi> wherein your Oaths and Names are
upon Record, the Allegiance due to their Prince from his subjects, amongst whom you
are the chief, multiplyes your Obligations to the maintaining and enlarging of his
Royall Power. And yet in these your Provinces, while you stand Spectatours, the
Churches of God and his Saints, founded by the ancient piety of your Princes, which
your Ancestours and your selves have adorned with victorious trophies, by sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and impious traytours are burned down, and profaned, your Ancestours tembes
violated, the Statues of your Order, and your Coats of Arms, in many places im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
thrown to the ground, trod upon, and broken. To omit their barbarity to
Virgins consecrated to God, robbing of their Nunneries; and for addition to their
contumelies, cruelly turning out of their cities and holy mansions, all the Priests and
Religious. But what kind of men are they that have raised this storm in the <hi>Low-countreys?</hi>
What dregs of the people, what vile and abject fugitives, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
from Religion? cruell, but to those that fear them: cowardly slaves if they
themselves be terrified. A few <hi>Secliners</hi> and Countreymen, accidentally taking
Arms, destroyed a multitude of these Church robbers. Did not one man yesterday,
catching up a spear, when a great sort of these Traytours were gathered together,
fright them not onely from a Chapel which they threatned, but from the Citie it self?
Will you suffer this pestilence to rage without opposition, and to ruine the State and
Peace of your Countrey, and your Religion, before your eyes, and these troubles to open
the way unto a forrein Conquest? Nay, it is commonly reported, these villanies are
committed, some of you not onely not resisting, but being also privie and assistant to
the plot. I am not ignorant, that such Calumnies use to be spread abroad by wicked
men, to make good Subjects less active in doing Iustice upon the enemies to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And perhaps they hope to fright me with great names, and so inforce my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to their unjust Demands. What is fit to be done by men of honour, look you to
that; for what concerns my self, I religiously profess, that no mans menaces shall
compell me, to mix the new figments of these people, with the ancient and Orthodox
Religions established in these Provinces. Nay, if the King himself, upon whose
Grace and Pleasure I depend, should dispense with the <hi>Low-countrey men,</hi> to be
of what Religion they list, (which how farre it is from his Maiesties intention,
none can be ignorant) I would instantly depart the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> because I
would not be an Agent in, or Interpreter of such Indulgence. But if I were stayed
by force of Arms (which I hear they threaten) I call God to witness, I would offer
my self to the slaughter, and be torn in pieces, rather then suffer a Profession of
Faith, contrary to the Catholick Religion. To prevent all this, be it your care, my
Lords, I do coniure you by your duty to God, your Allegiance to the King, and your
Love unto your Countrey. And because gentle remedies will not prevail with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
people, and that they trust to the protection of the confederate Gentlemen,
let us at last receive the Arms and Assistance which you have often promised, and
ought long since to have performed. That when the King shall come, who will be

according to every ones severall interest and inclination; quickning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires

partly that she might not be an eye-witness of the destruction of holy

went to the Governess, humbly beseeching her, that she would not by her

that faithfull Citie, under the notion of Conspiratours against his Majestie.
Nor did she alter her resolution for all this, though a great man informed
her Excellence,<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses verymuch trouble.</note> that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> speaking of her going away to
some at Court, told them, among other discourse, That if the Governess
would leave the Town, and consequently desert the State, he himself was
resolved, his Towns and Fortunes should not become a prey to any: That
their <hi>French</hi> neighbours might easily possesse themselves of <hi>Flanders:</hi> and
that long since, they pretended a title to <hi>Artois,</hi> and <hi>Haynolt</hi> nor could the rest
of the Provinces want new Lords.<note place="margin">The Governess more and more threatned.</note> But that which most of all troubled the
Governess, was a rumour dispersed in <hi>Bruxels,</hi> that she was the onely cause
why the <hi>Gheuses</hi> had not their Petition granted, which she might do of her
self, having received plenipotentiary Authority from the King, to signe any
conditions for quieting the <hi>Low-countrey</hi> tumults. And that if still she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

there were some in readiness,<note place="margin">Ulricus</note> that seizing upon her,<note place="margin">Viglius</note> together with <hi>Viglius,</hi>
Keeper of the Seal, and <hi>Egmont</hi> himself, would extort by force, what

                  </note> and being staid again: Fear overcoming her, she at last was

businesse, she wrote to his Majestie, in these words. <hi>Now when I come to add

when the storm hung over this Citie, and that so many openly rung in mine

two demands made by the Covenanters. When my house was besieged, my mind

protesting before them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And of the particulars granted.</note> 
                  <hi>that my consent was extorted thereunto, I made a conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of pardon and indemnity to the Covenanters, and to the rest I gave libertie
to hear their Ministers preach, onely in places where they had been accustomed so
to do; provided they came unarmed, and molested not the Catholicks. With a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

inforced him:<note place="margin">Septemb. 4. 5. 7.</note> First, that he might by this means restore the

thousand men used to go out of Town to sermons, he greatly feared
lest, at their return, some pragmaticall knaves, gaping after pillage, might
joyn with them, and (the multitude prevailing) plunder the rich Merchants
houses. Lastly, because the Hereticks already had sermons in <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
therefore in pursuance of that agreement, he had assigned them places in the
citie.<note place="margin">But not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory.</note> Notwithstanding, the Governesse liked not the proceedings of the
Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> perhaps because she her self was guilty of too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
and likewise in fear to be reproved for anothers fault: perhaps,
because the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had indeed given further allowance to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
then they could challenge by their articles, which licensed their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

that were about the Altar, took to themselves mens courages, rising

that execrable rudenesse. And what with threats, and authoritie (for
some of them were women of qualitie) what with force and clamour, those
barking hell-hounds ran away, without so much as touching the Altar, or
tearing the Church-ornaments. These women are indeed worthy the
knowledge and commendations of posteritie. Unlesse perhaps their praise

they furiously made their way into the Monasterie it self, with such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,

But the Emperour,<note place="margin">Who disswades him.</note> because he had heard, that the Governess and the

promised her his endeavours, if any thing was yet uncomposed.

troubled to hear of their difference with the Governess, and of the stirres that daily

would be acceptable to the Catholick King, and he was sure, they would be safe for

This Letter, and divers more of the same subject written to the Lords, the

give free passage through all their Towns, and Jurisdictions, to such forces

wrote the most confident and longest letter of them all. For he not

maintained their innocence; but defying the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the veneration
of holy Images, and the tyrannie of the Inquisitours, concluded, that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>The minds of many were exceedingly troubled at the news, insomuch as
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> his brother <hi>Lewis,</hi> the Counts <hi>Egmont, Hochstrat,</hi> and
<hi>Horn,</hi> met at <hi>Dendermund,</hi> betwixt <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Gant;</hi> to communicate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
which every one of them had received, concerning the Kings co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming;
and thereupon to advise what generall course was to be held. Though
this meeting was appointed, and came together with all secresie, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
Governess knew all their proceedings.<note place="margin">Novem. 12.</note> And as multitudes of spies
alwayes attend a Jealous Prince,<note place="margin">Letters, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings displeasure and resolution to be revenged on three <hi>Low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Lords.</hi>
                  </note> there wanted not that kind of men, Eves-droppers,
and Hocus-Pocuses, the summe of whose life is to know and not
to be known, which pryed into all their secret consultations and resolutions.
And as farre as she could understand, the Governess wrote to the King, that
by many Letters sent from <hi>Spain,</hi> and there produced, it was confirmed,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41239:77"/>
that the King incensed at the plunder and spoil of Churches, was resolved to
bring an army into the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> to punish such as had either been prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalls
or accessaries to the fact. In other Letters it was added, that the
Prince of <hi>Orange, Egmont,</hi> and <hi>Horn,</hi> were believed at Court to be the
Advisers and Protectours of all these commotions, and therefore the
King aimed chiefly at their Heads. To this effect were read the Letters of
<hi>Francisco Alava</hi> the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Embassadour to <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from <hi>Paris</hi> to the Governess, and pretended to be intercepted, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
the Governess of the Kings coming with a potent army of <hi>Spaniards</hi>
and <hi>Italians,</hi> and of the new League concluded between the Kings, <hi>Philip</hi>
and <hi>Charles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A fourth Lord is added, falsely,</note> that his Majestie might be the better able to punish the Rebells,
and four Lords, that is, besides the fore-mentioned triumvirate, <hi>Peter Etnest,</hi>
Count <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> as he himself told the Governess, he heard it from divers
reported.<note place="margin">but subtily.</note> Whether all this was cunningly given out, to move the people
to despair of pardon, or really writ from <hi>Spain,</hi> and by <hi>Alava,</hi> I leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Judges.<note place="margin">Novem. 12.</note> Sure I am, that the Governess writing to the King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
she had as yet no certain knowledge of the Letters sent her by <hi>Alava,</hi>
and said to be intercepted; and assured Count <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> that he was in very
great esteem with his Majestie, and that lie was onely invented to draw him
from the Kings party. The Kings coming being therefore ascertained by
many mens Letters read in that private Convention of the Lords, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
was put how the King might be prevented from bringing his Army
into the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Quere made whether they should oppose the King with an army, or admit him.</note> And when on the one part severall wayes of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
were proposed; on the other part a warre was feared, which they could
encounter with no proportionable strength; and that a third sort held it the
best course to trust to the Kings mercy,<note place="margin">Both wayes seem dangerous.</note> from which the major part dissented:
herein their different opinions concurred, that to oppose his Majesties pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
into the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> the treason would be certain, the victory doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
and to admit him, were yet more dangerous. For now the Breach was
so farre made, as it would be a madness to hope for mercy, when they had
received an angry and an armed Prince. They must therefore either flie
the place, and leave their countrey unpeopled to the Conquerour; or they
must set up a new Prince, under whose protection they may live in safetie.
This last Proposall seemed the best,<note place="margin">They resolve to change their Prince.</note> and they might take a singular good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
if (now that the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> shewed himself desirous to
compose those differences) under colour of making him the Umpire, they
secretly treated to put the <hi>Low-countreys</hi> into his hands; which would be less
subject to censure, because in so doing they should not strike at Monarchy,
but onely change their Monarch; Especially, since they still adhered to one
of the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> And this advantage would ensue, that the new
elected Prince would have so great an obligation laid upon him, as if their
Designes should haply want success, howsoever the Emperour would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
never to desert them, without making their peace with King <hi>Philip</hi>
Having in this manner consulted, they left <hi>Dendermond,</hi> full of cares and
doubts, particularly Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> who either to draw more of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to the cause, or that being yet unresolved himself, he had a mind to
try how his friends stood affected, wrote a letter to Count <hi>Mansfeld,</hi>

                  </note>
putting him in remembrance of what they had ioyntly acted in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these troubles, he complained of <hi>Mansfelds</hi> abandoning their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
without any iust pretence. Then he accused the inconstancie of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness,
who would not see that performed which she had promised to the
Covenanters: but that she her self had solicited the King to annull her Act.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41239:78"/>
as forced, and therefore pressed him to come with an Army, and make his
seditious and rebellious subjects a formidable example to posterity. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Egmont</hi> assured him, it was evident by many mens letters, which he had
compared at <hi>Dendermond,</hi> that the King resolved to cut off the heads of
four Lords (in which number <hi>Mansfeld</hi> himself was listed) to keep the
rest in obedience. In the last place, he said, he should be very glad by his
answer to know what he would advise him to do. This Letter Count <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld</hi>
privately gave the Governess, and with the same fidelity shewed her
what he answered.<note place="margin">C. <hi>Mansfelds</hi> Answer.</note> 
                  <hi>That no man could justly complain of him, when, from the
beginning he went a long with</hi> Egmont <hi>and the rest, upon no other ground, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it seemed advantageous to Religion, and their Countrey, that Cardinall</hi>
Granvel <hi>should be removed, the Inquisition taken away, the rigour of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
Edicts mitigated, and lastly a generall Pardon granted to such as the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
would move for to the King. To all which particulars his Majestie having
graciously condescended, he saw no colour of a grievance now remaining. He would
therefore freely speak his thoughts, (especially at his Request) that things were
gone too farre, to the great contempt of the Divine Majesty, and scandall of the
Christian world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1565.</note> 
                  <hi>That there was time yet left to make some kind of Satisfaction
for offences past, that is, by so behaving themselves among the present troubles, that
when the King comes, they may meet him, not with a cloudie look, nor such a mind
as can be taxed by any. Touching the report of the Kings anger and intended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
for his own part he feared it not. He had ever been, and ever would be so
faithfull to his Sovereigne, that if he pleased to command his attendance in</hi> Spain,
<hi>he would instantly go thither, and having rendred an accompt of his actions, hoped
to receive from his Royall Master no little Grace and Benefit. Nor spake he this as if
Count</hi> Egmont <hi>could not securely say as much; but that he might daily adde to this
security, by cutting off all occasions of suspicion. And having so often affronted the
King, with pretending publick Necessity, they would now at length forbear to press
their Prince, to govern his Provinces by other mens directions. Lastl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Mansfeld</hi> concluded) <hi>if</hi> Egmont <hi>would hear his friends advice, he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
his friend for ever; if not, he was resolved to value nothing in this world e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall

the constancy of Count<note place="margin">The Governess sends abstracts of both Letters to the King, and writes in count <hi>Mansfelds</hi> behalf.</note> 
                  <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> the Governess sent the heads of both let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to his Maiestie, beseeching him, that since he found so much faith in
<hi>Mansfeld,</hi> especially at such a time, he would be pleased abundantly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
him with the grant of his just desires, a particular whereof she
had annexed to the Letter. This, moved by the Governess, might perhaps
make one suspect these Letters to be forged by <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> to ingratiate himself
with her Excellence, and to obtain with more facility those things, for which
he had been a long and earnest suiter to the King; or at least, that he had
counterfeited, if not <hi>Egmonts</hi> Letter, yet his own Answer to it: But many
things offer themselves,<note place="margin">Assured of the truth of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence.</note> which absolutely clear this doubt; as, Count <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts</hi>
hand, well known to the Governess; and her intelligence of the truth
of <hi>Egmonts</hi> actions, which may fright the greatest confidence in the world
into a blush, that shall presume to charge him with such a forgery. Add to
this, the reputation and manners of Count <hi>Mansfeld</hi> (which manners either
absolve or condemne every one) far from the least imputation of any such
deceit;<note place="margin">The Governess grievously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains to the King, that her letters were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed in his Court.</note> and lastly, his constant adherence to the Kings cause. So as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness
justly confident in his integrity, commended him as much as she
could possibly to his Maiesty; one thing she seemed to admire, that she
found in <hi>Egmonts</hi> Letter, the very words she had writ in cypher to the King.
She therefore complained to the King, that secrets were brought out of his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41239:78"/>
Court into the <hi>Low-countreys. Was any of his Ministers of State so dull-brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or open breasted, to suffer these mysterious parts of Government to be scrued out
of his mouth or hands? or so ill-natured and perfidious, as to reveal the Counsells
of his Prince to the enemy? That she certainly knew many copies of Letters she
had sent his Majestie for two yeares now past, and divers of the Originalls them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
were come to the hands of the</hi> Low-countrey <hi>Lords. How destructive was
this to his affairs? how derogatory to the Royall Dignity? She therefore beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King, that hereafter, he would either see her Letters burnt, or give them in
custody to faithfull Servants, that would keep them from the knowledge of such as
were otherwise.</hi>

put in execution.<note place="margin">Which they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly offer to the King.</note> At which time Count <hi>Hochstrat</hi> (Lieutenant Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Antwerp</hi> for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>) sent a Petition to the Governesse,
delivered him by the Hereticks of that citie, wherein they desired libertie of
Conscience for themselves, and their brethren, for which they offered the
King three hundred thousand Florens, which was supposed to be the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of some, that they might with lesse suspicion go to and fro to gather
money; and in the mean time, both deceive the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that would be
easily tempted with so much gold, and likewise their own partie, that would
more willingly open their purse for obtaining the free exercise of Religion,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41239:80"/>
then for the maintaining of a warre. Unlesse perhaps that vast summe was
offered to set forth the greatnesse of their faction. And therefore many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of the Petition were sent about the Provinces, subscribed by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and Merchants that ingaged for payment of the money: thereby to
advance their reputation and to fright the Governesse with so great a power.
But her Excellence,<note place="margin">The Governesse contemns their offer.</note> nothing moved with the vain noise of their wealth, did
not so much as vouchsafe an answer to <hi>Hochstrat.</hi> The Petition it self she sent
to the King,<note place="margin">Novem. 18.</note> to quicken him upon so many provocations.</p>
               <p>In the interim she her self,<note place="margin">The same of the Kings coming staggers the Conspiratours. Whom the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernesse endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to work upon with letters and promises.</note> knowing all that passed in their Consistories
and Assemblies, when she saw that divers of the Conspiratours, believing
the news of the Kings coming, grew very fearfull, thought it best to make
her advantage of that fear; and therefore writing letters to them, full of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and confidence, instructed the messengers to make them large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to some, which she knew were no enemies to Religion, she wrote letters
upon those blanks the King had sent her signed with his sign Manual; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
suiting her words to the times, she exhorted them to defend the Cause of
Religion to keep the people in their antient Duty and Obedience:<note place="margin">Not without Artifice,</note> and these
were to be so delivered, that they should not be altogether concealed from
such as were not invited, whereby jealousies and differences might arise
among them.<note place="margin">And successe.</note> And it happened very conveniently, that at the same time,
the Governesse received some letters from the King writ with his own hand
to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and some other of the Low-countrey Lords, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
much affection to them, which she presently sent to the presse, and
had them published; the result of all this was, That partly out of fear the
Lords would desert them, whose resolutions the Confederates perceived to
waver: partly out of hope, which they were full of, because they saw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
courted and honoured by the King: partly out of malice to others,
which as they thought suspected and hated them; divers of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
leaving the publick meetings of the Conspiratours, returned to their
own houses, to follow their private businesse: or came over and submitted
to the Governesse,<note place="margin">Whereupon, the Governesse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recovered her spirits,</note> striving rather to merit the Kings favour, then his indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation.

And to begin the right way by craving a blessing from God, she
wrote letters in the Kings name to all the Bishops and chiefest Prelates, to
appoint in all their Cities Fast-dayes, and publick Prayers, and to use all
other means for appeasing the Divine wrath.<note place="margin">To the <hi>French</hi> King she noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for a warre.</note> She likewise sent an Agent

by the Electours, <hi>Augustus Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Frederick Count Palatine.</hi>
And truly <hi>Count Mansfeld</hi> would have offered the Emperour, that he, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
would either convert the Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> to his Allegeance; or take
away the power of his disloyaltie, by imploying the sonnes of <hi>Iohn Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
that bore an inveterate malice to Duke <hi>Augustus,</hi> for depriving their
Father of the Electorate: and if they should be incouraged to take arms,
no doubt but they would involve all <hi>Saxony</hi> in a War,<note place="margin">Count Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felds advice upon this point. Which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends but makes no use of.</note> and <hi>Augustus</hi> would
have enough to do, to extinguish the fire in his own Dukedome, without
scattering it in anothers Dominions. But the Governesse could not at that
time spare Count <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> she therefore held it sufficient to commend his
design, and to inform the King of it, and his readinesse to serve his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41239:80"/>
pretermitting no occasion to name him for the advance of the Counts
former Suit; and perhaps he himself had an eye upon it, when he made this
offer, which undoubtedly would more advance his favour with the King,
then his trouble in <hi>Saxony.</hi> Thus many proffer huge service to such as they
know will not accept it; especially if they think themselves able to do their
businesse without the profferer's help.<note place="margin">She increases the souldiery.</note> Moreover it was <hi>Mansfelds</hi> plot
(the Counts of <hi>Aremberg,</hi> and <hi>Megen,</hi> being of the same opinion) that

all Modesty and Shame, as to affirm that these abominations were licensed by the

as not to distinguish things so distant, or to suffer so execrable impiety. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the Kings name, she commanded the Governours of the Provinces, that as

Dutchess, that in <hi>August</hi> last they met by her command, to disarm and quiet
the people. They complained, that by letters directed to the Magistrates
from her Highness, they were prohibited to exercise the Ministery of the
Gospel in those places where they were allowed to have Sermons; when
notwithstanding that under the notion of Sermons, all other rites were
comprehended. For it is the solemn custome where Sermons are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
there likewise to tolerate all appendences to the same Religion; and they
accordingly explained the toleration to the People, and promised them the
free use of Sermons, and all their other <hi>Rites,</hi> of which freedome the People
being now debarred, they claimed promise of the Covenanters &amp; every day
implored their faith, by new Expostulations and Letters, some of which
they had annexed to this Petition. Lastly, they were amazed and grieved to
see the <hi>Low-countreys</hi> every day frighted with great forces, themselves expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Cities, watched in the fields, and every where reputed for enemies
to the State. All which being inconsistent with their own Loyalty and
Honour, and the Tranquillity of the people; they humbly prayed her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that according to her Princely word obliged under her hand and seal,
she would both secure the Covenanters and suffer the People to hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and those things which alwayes go along with Sermons. For the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41239:81"/>
better effecting whereof,<note place="margin">1566.</note> they humbly desired, that her Excellence would
please to disband the souldiers lately raised, and call in her Edict contrary to
the capitulation.<note place="margin">And many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> For which they should be so much bound to his Maiestie
&amp; her Highness, that both their Dignities should by them be ever valued far
above their own lives or fortunes. But otherwise, in spirit they foresaw a
great destruction of the people and the imminent ruine of the Nation; the
foretelling whereof, and labouring to avert it as much as in them lay, would
hereafter free them, if not from sorrow, yet from any crime. This Petition
the Governess communicated to her Privie Counsellours,<note place="margin">Febr. 16.</note> and a few dayes
after, by their advice, returned answer to <hi>Brederod</hi> (withall commanding it
should be printed and published) the heads whereof I shall briefly give you.
<hi>She understood not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">But the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer grants them nothing.</note> she said, <hi>who those Gentlemen were, or those People of the</hi>
Low-countreys, <hi>in whose name this Petition was presented; when many of those
Gentlemen that petitioned in April last, did not onely profess themselves to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
satisfaction; but daily came to offer their services to the King. That she one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tolerated Sermons, and that so much against her will, as may testifie how farre
she is from giving them power to appoint Consistories, create Magistrates, to levy
taxes, to collect above twenty hundred thousand Florens, to confound the marriages
of Catholicks and Hereticks, and consequently their Successions and Honours. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the</hi> Calvinisticall <hi>Suppers which they had, and Congregations; in most part
whereof, since they detracted from the Authority of the Prince, and his subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Officers, and sought by degrees to introduce a new Commonwealth, they might
see how likely it was that these things (which they call onely Ceremonies of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
should be permitted by the Governess, to the so great Dishonour of God and the
King. That indeed she had capitulated with them, and that the capitulation was
and shall be observed; but not in things prejudiciall to Religion, and the Royall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
But why should they, that complain of the breach of Articles, passe over
in silence, That since their own agreement in the moneth of August, so many
faithlesse and sacrilegious Villanies have been done; Churches destroyed, Religious
Persons turned out of their Monasteries; Hereticall Gospellers from forrein parts, by
force of Arms brought to preach, in places where their Sermons were never heard
before; Cities a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d Provinces by their Letters or Emissaries solicited to mutiny and
rebell; and diverse other foul things committed, whereof the Petitioners themselves
were Authours: for under their Protection, the people have presumed to seize upon
his Majesties Magazines; to expell his Officers; at the ringing of a Bell, to muster
in the fields; to destroy Monasteries and Gentlemens houses with fire and sword; to
possesse themselves of Towns, and marking out all Catholicks for the slaughter, the
Governess her self not excepted: they would have made a generall Massacre in the</hi>
Low-countreys, <hi>if the Traitours Letters to them of</hi> Valenciens <hi>had not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted,
and so their horrid Designe by Gods goodness prevented. That by the
premisses they may perceive how unseasonably they petition for her Edict to be revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and the Souldiers disbanded, that is, in other words, for Iustice to be disarmed,
and exposed to the injuries of the wicked. Let them not cozen themselves, she would
do neither of both; but was resolved to guard the Commonwealth, if need
should be, with new Laws and Souldiers: and not to lay down, especially at this time,
the sword that God puts into Princes hands. She therefore advised them to forbear
meddling with Publick Affairs, and every one to mind his private business, that
they may not shortly force the King at his coming to forget his native Clemency.
That she her self will use her utmost endeavours, to save the Low-countreys from
the Ruine threatned by these popular Tumults, which they have raised.</hi>

the <hi>Tholousians</hi> (as he signified to the Governesse by <hi>Marius Carduin</hi>) or
more probably lest, to succour <hi>Beavor,</hi> the Bridge should give passage to
the Catholiques, whose cause he could not desert, nor would defend.
Also by his command, the next day, all the ports of <hi>Antwerp</hi> were shut,
the Citizens wondring what should be his reason;<note place="margin">They fight at <hi>Ostervell.</hi>
                  </note> when on the suddaine
hearing the thunder of Cannon hard by the Towne,<note place="margin">The Citizens of <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
                  </note> they ran to the wals,
and saw a Battaile fought at <hi>Ostervell.</hi> They knew the Ensignes of both
Armies,<note place="margin">See the Battell from the walls. They act their different wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes to both sides.</note> displayed alongst the River side, and almost heard the cryes
both of those that charged, and fell. Nor did all the Towne behold that
Martiall Scene with the same wishes, but shouted according to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
inclinations, with divers kinds of clamour, as if they had been upon a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41239:84"/>
Stage: sometimes chearefully incouraging their Partie, sometimes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and crying shame upon them, they shooke their hands and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their bodies, as if they themselves were really in the Feild, strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or avoyding Blowes. Till the routed <hi>Tholousians</hi> fled. For <hi>Beavor</hi> had
been so quick in his march, that comming upon them before they could
well arme themselves,<note place="margin">The Tholousi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans defeated.</note> and repaire to their Colours, they had scarce time
to put their men in Order of Battaile. Yet for a while they stood. At first
their number imboldened them, and at last their Houses and Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
saved them. But those being fired, part of them were burnt in their
owne dwellings; some few slaine in the Field, but the most forced to
leap in the River, and either drowned, or as they swam, shot in the
backs. <hi>Tholouse</hi> himselfe despairing of Releife or Pardon tooke a Barne,
and was there burnt.<note place="margin">Their Generall burned.</note> There fell at this Battaile (the first that was fought
with the <hi>Low-country</hi> Rebells) 1500. of the <hi>Gheuses.</hi> About 300. were
taken prisoners, and all put to the Sword by <hi>Beavors</hi> command, because
it was conceived the <hi>Antwerpers</hi> would sally out, and assist the Remainder
of their conquered Friends. And indeed when the <hi>Calvinists</hi> saw their
Brethren routed,<note place="margin">The Calvinists would have sallyed out of <hi>Antwerp</hi> to helpe their Fellowes. But finding themselves lockt in they grew rageous.</note> and put to flight (for it troubled not the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who
hate Calvinists farre more then they doe Catholiques) presently taking
up Armes, they marched directly to the Bridge to succour their distressed
Party. But when they found the Bridge broken downe, and saw the
Ports shut up, they ran through the Streets, as if they had been drunke,
and cryed Arme, Arme. And in foure houres space 14000. men were come
together, having neither any certaine Generall, nor resolution whether
to make way through the Ports, or turne their fury upon those that kept
them in. They say <hi>Tholouse</hi> his Wife, in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> helped forward this
combustion. For understanding the Defeate and Danger of her Husband,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tholouse's</hi> wife sets them on.</note>
(his Death as yet she knew not) almost out of her wits, she ranne about
the Towne, howling, and crying to the Calvinsts for Assistance or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
And now the Prince of Orange (with Count <hi>Hochstrat</hi> (meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

their great opinion of him, easily ro quiet this Distemper, and began to
give them reasons why the Bridge was broke, for feare the conquering
Army, having a Party within the Towne, should make themselves
Masters of it. But the rest of his words were drowned with hideous cryes
and Railings. They called him Traytour to the Cause, and then he found
by experience,<note place="margin">The Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</note> that Majesty without strength is not safe among the incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

Prince his brest, as if he would give fire upon him: so much dares the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
Rascall animated by his contagious Fellowes. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
therefore thought it well for the present, if he could get off; for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
&amp; boldnesse of the Calvinists increased. And now seizing upon the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Bridge, and taking the Cannon out of the Magazine, they drew them
upon their carriages,<note place="margin">They take up Armes.</note> and planted them against the Court, resolving to set

and the Mint, and drawing after him a huge sort of <hi>Lutherans,</hi> joyned
them to the Catholiques, whereof no lesse then 8000 had armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The Catholiques and <hi>Lutherans</hi> formed into a Body, with Colours
flying marched to the Pallace of Justice, and there made a Stand, ready
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41239:84"/>
to defend it, if the Calvinists should attempt any thing; and these, as if
they would fight, came on, and presenting their Muskets seemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the word. When the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> attended by all the Senate,
and a strong Guard of Souldiers,<note place="margin">The Calvinists terrifyed.</note> came to the Calvinists, and with a
commanding countenance, advised them to lay down Armes, if they
had any Demands to make, they might be more easily obtained without
Tumult: if they did otherwise, he swore he would be a perpetuall Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the name of <hi>Calvin.</hi> Whereat the Calvinists seeming to be dismay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
submitted, as if it were in Honour to the Prince; when indeed
they found themselves much too weak for the Catholique and Lutheran
Forces, to which the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Merchants flocked in great
numbers armed, fearing they should finally be plundered by the Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
who had either to that end begun the Tumult, or at least would
so conclude. Therefore Hostages being given and received on both sides,<note place="margin">and quieted upon conditions</note>
the Calvinists upon certaine conditions (which both they and the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> took their Oaths to see observed) for the present laid downe
Armes: which notwithstanding were shortly taken up againe, both by the
Calvinists and Lutherans, when they heard of the Siege and Danger of

                  <note place="margin">The seige of <hi>Valenciens.</hi>

because of their Vicinity to <hi>France,</hi> which being considered the <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenians</hi>
were ever ruled with a gentler hand, but with a more attentiue eye.
The Governesse was very fearefull, lest the <hi>French</hi> if they stirred at that

they knew that one <hi>Grange</hi> of <hi>Narbon</hi> a Calvinist Minister by his <hi>French</hi>

                  <hi>Norcarmius</hi> coming to the Towne in the Evening

they had ever beene and ever would be faithfull to the King, and to the

in the morning,<note place="margin">But at their appointed time fly off.</note> at the time when they had promised to receiue his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,

                     </gap> gives him Reasons for taking of the Oath.</note> He made it appeare by many Arguments, that
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s determination to resigne his Commands, could not
be approved, either by the Governesse or any of the Lords, not only because
it would be disadvantageous to the <hi>Lowcountryes,</hi> and dishonourable to
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> himselfe, but likewise because such kind of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements
confer'd by the Kings immediate Commission, can neither be
taken away by the Governesse, nor resigned by him, without the King's
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41239:88"/>
Leave. That therefore he should presently resume his Offices, and consider
it was no rash Determination of his Majesty, in this common Disturbance
of the Provinces to require, that their Governours, by a new Oath,
should testifie their Fidelity and Allegeance.<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> heares and answers him with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
(in the presence of Count <hi>Hochstrat,</hi> who came in by chance) that
for many and serious considerations, which he had as yet communicated
to no man, he refused this Oath. First, because the like was never requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of any former Governour;<note place="margin">The first.</note> then,<note place="margin">The Second.</note> for as much as he had long agoe
taken an Oath of Allegiance to the King, as other Lords did that lived
within his Majesty's Dominions, it might be thought he had broke his
first Oath,<note place="margin">The Third.</note> in regard he was put to sweare againe. Moreover, because he
had sworne to preserve the Priviledges of his Provinces, if peradventure
he should be commanded to the contrary, he could not obey the Order,
being tyed by Oath not to doe it: and yet he bound himselfe to obey it, if
he should now sweare to doe what he should be commanded in the King's
name against any persons whatsoever.<note place="margin">The Fourth.</note> Add to this, that in the Forme of
the Oath the Emperour was not excepted, to whom as a feudatary he was
obliged, and would not beare Armes against him; Nay more, there was
no exception of his Sons and Friends, as the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> and diverse
others,<note place="margin">The Fifth.</note> against which he would not fight. Another Reason was, for that
many Edicts were daily published, making it capitall for all such as were
not Catholiques; which Edicts should never be executed by his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for his Heart would not suffer him to inflict such punishments, as men
were now liable to, for their Religion. Nay, if he should take this Oath,
he might be compelled, in the last place, to put his Wife to death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she was a Lutheran.<note place="margin">The Last and indeed the true Reason con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rned the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi>
                  </note> Lastly it was to be considered, that he who
commanded in the King's name, might be such as it would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with his quality and Honour to obey; and here, with Indignation,
he named the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva,</hi> and said no more. For as it was reported, the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva's</hi> coming troubled him exceedingly, his other Reasons on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were pretended, and because invalid, therefore multiplyed. Nor
would the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> have lost his Government for an Oath, but
he thought it unsafe to trust himselfe in the hands of that <hi>Spanish Duke,</hi> by
nature melancholick and cruell; and out of an ancient Emulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, too likely to carry himselfe proudlier in his Command; or if
he should be civill, yet the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> could never brooke a man,
from whom he must receive Common Civility in the nature of a Pardon.
But <hi>Bertius</hi> sufficiently instructed as well by nature, as by the Governesse,<note place="margin">Bertius replyes to every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note>
answered him prudently to every particular, He said, it was no wonder,
in regard the Provinces were not troubled in the time of their former
Governours, that no such Oath was required of them, That to take the
same Oath againe, was not by a new Profession to repaire the Violation
of an old Vow, but to raise greater Alacrity in new Dangers. That to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Priviledges of the Provinces, the King had noe lesse obliged his
Faith, then the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his, and therefore it concerned his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to be careful, that nothing should be commanded, which was Breach of
Priviledge. Nor was the War in agitation, against the Emperour, or Empire,
or the Duke of <hi>Cleue,</hi> all which he was assured the Governesse would very
willingly let him except in his Oath. That the Care of the Edicts and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Lawes against Hereticks should not be committed to him, much lesse
should he be inforced by any ones Command to Punish his wife.<note place="margin">But perswades not.</note> Thus <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
endeavoured to overthrow the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Reasons without
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41239:89"/>
mentioning the Duke of <hi>Alva;</hi> perhaps doubtfull how to answer that
Point, perhaps because, vpon the naming of his Wife, the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>
replyed (not expecting till he came so farre as <hi>Alva</hi>) that he knew
the King, when he arrived in the <hi>Lowcountryes,</hi> would not suffer any mans
Wife to be of another Religion; therefore, for his owne part, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to remoue into <hi>Germany</hi> with his Family, before the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
lest if he did it after, it might be supposed he was rather banished,
then that he departed of his own accord: neverthelesse in what place so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

of the same things, they departed, having concluded nothing. They say,
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> before he went, taking aside <hi>Count Egmont:</hi> spake
of the present Dangers, and intreated him to withdraw, and by no means
to stand this bloudy Spanish Tempest that hung over the Low-countryes.
And when <hi>Egmont,</hi> confident in his owne merits, and scorning Danger,
disputed against his opinion, and how the King's mercy would pardon
all, if he found the Low-countries quieted; This <q>
                     <hi>Mercy of the King</hi>
(said Orange) <hi>that you trust to, will be your ruine; My Soule presages
(I wish it may be false,) that you are to be the Bridge the Spaniards will
tread upon in their coming over to the Low-countryes.</hi>
                  </q> At which words,
as assured of his Prophesy, and that he should never see <hi>Egmont</hi> againe, he
held him hard in his Armes, and so, both weeping, tooke their last Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.
Next day,<note place="margin">His Letter to the Governesse</note> he wrote a Letter to the Governesse, Intreating her,
<q>
                     <hi>that she would please to remember the King,</hi>

                  </q> Immediately he removed with his wife and Children

being quit of his old Rivall, and therefore assuring himselfe of the first
Place in the Governesses Favour, he began to offer his Service, and to be
active in publique Affayres. First taking the Oath, as he had promised,

them, by the Chancellour and <hi>Merodius,</hi> to returne home, and teach their

her, that to prevent quarrell betweene the Townsmen and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,

receiued part of the <hi>German Army</hi> and their Generall Col. <hi>Schovenburg,</hi>

albeit most of them were ignorant people, rather wicked then subtle,
their Greatest understandings reaching no higher then Taverne-Politicks;
yet they were growne so numerous &amp; so strong by the Assistance of wicked

that they were become absolute Masters of the Towne, and could
not be outed but with greate paines and Trouble, and with a miserable

that long strugled,<note place="margin">The Governesse will not grant their Pardon unlesse they take a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of her men.</note> and at last was forced to leaue it. But the Governesse
though she was glad at heart to see Commissioners from so great a City,

no talking of a Pardon, till they had received a Garrison: that done,
she promised them, to use her best endeavours, in preferring their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

pardon and settle the Provinces, or else (which she thought would be best)
to come himselfe among his Subjects, now quiet, and willing to obey:
not terrifying them with an army, but receiving them to mercy. And the
Later of these two Courses the King indeed in many of his Letters to the

or <hi>pretended</hi> Resolution, and in stead of Coming in Person to send <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
Toledo</hi> Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> his Lieutenant thither, because it was the great

Many <hi>Spanish</hi> Lords of the Councell were of the same Opinion, nay

the world: and in all these Punctualityes and curious Accommodations
for his March, there was nothing of substance, all meerly Show and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
Nor can any man perswade mee that King <hi>Philip,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> a subtill and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Prince, would at that time, leave his chiefe strength, when he
found some beginnings of the Rebellion of the <hi>Moores,</hi> and was inwardly
so much offended with his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> Prince of <hi>Spaine.</hi> For should he
take his Son along into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and bring the Lords a Patron

him behind, and trust him with <hi>Spain,</hi> which it was likely he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
in Tumults when he was left to himselfe, whose fierce nature even
his Majesty could hardly moderate in the time of peace. But the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
these Reasons,<note place="margin">How the King was advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by this dissimulation.</note> and with new Preparations fed the Rumour of his
Voiage, thereby to keepe the <hi>Lowcountry-Lords</hi> in more obedience, and
to have the fairer Pretence to put off the Emperour (whom the Lords as
it was said meant to make Arbiter) from interessing himselfe in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
of the <hi>Lowcountryes:</hi> and by the fame of an Army to deterre others

in his dissimulation by a quartan Ague,<note place="margin">A part well acted.</note> which holding him long,
was thought to be the Cause of his Delay, especially for that
he still continued his care and provisions for the Voiage.<note place="margin">Yet not so well but some saw through it.</note> Though some
of his nearest Servants knowing all this to be but Pageantry, suspected
his Ague likewise to be fained. But when the King was recovered, and that
by Letters from the Governesse his Majesty was certified of the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some Townes,<note place="margin">The Governess presses the Kings comming with new Arguments.</note> and Danger of all, unlesse prevented by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:

often Laughed at the Comedy of the Royall expedition, did now doubt
the truth of it:<note place="margin">Though <hi>Strada</hi> is of opinion that all was but jugling for these Reasons.</note> yet still the King did but act his part, &amp; was not serious. For
among other dissuasions from his Voyage, Letters came from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
giuing him intelligence; that the Lords were resolved, if the King (as
they heard) would bring an army into the <hi>Lowcountryes,</hi> that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
would call in forreigne Assistance, and casting off their Allegeance
oppose his Entry. Which howsoever he dissembled, or publiquely seemed
to slight, questionlesse he that was so jealous of his Crowne and Honour,
must needs be very sensible how much both would be indangered, if by
carrying an Army thither he should teach the <hi>Lowcountryes</hi> how to arme,
so render himselfe contemptible to his Subiects; and to the neighbour
Princes, that would looke on, or perhaps secretly assist the Rebells.
Therefore in the last Consultation which he held about it at <hi>Madrid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Councell about the Kings going.</note> his
Majesty would only have it put to the question, Whether he should goe
without an Army, which some perswaded: or take his Forces along:
which the <hi>Popes Nuntio</hi> earnestly advised.<note place="margin">The Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and their Characters.</note> Among his Privy-Councell,
which then were numerous, and great Statesmen, because the King
greatly relyed vpon their Iudgements; there came to the Board <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando
Toledo</hi> Duke of <hi>Alva, Roderick Gomez a Silva</hi> Prince of <hi>Ebora,</hi>
both of them very powerfull with the King:<note place="margin">D. Alva. Rui. Gomez. P. of Ebora.</note> but as Favour tooke place
of Estimation, he was greater in his Majestyes Account, this had the greater
Honours conferred upon him.<note place="margin">Cardinall <hi>Spinosa.</hi>
                  </note> There was likewise Cardinall <hi>Spinosa,</hi> who

President of the Councell of <hi>Castile,</hi> and had beene of so high Authority

Seale, and diverse others, most of them Councellours of approved integrity,
and such as seriously intended their Prince's Honour; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
as every one was of a sowre or gentle temper, they interpreted
according to their owne inclinations. Thus it is that all men forme their
Opinions; and the Vote which nature extorts, we thinke is given to the
Cause, when indeed we give it to our Humour.<note place="margin">Why the King was there in person.</note> The King himselfe sate in
Councell, to moderate by his presence the publique and continuall Iarres
between the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Ebora,</hi> contending no lesse
for superiority at the Board, then for preheminence in Court. Or rather
his Majesty came in person, that if any one (which he heard was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
should move for his Son to be Generall, he himselfe might breake off
the proposall.<note place="margin">Manric. de Lara.</note> And there was one that perswaded the sending of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
remembring his Majesty of <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> that left forrein Warres to
the Managery of his Sonnes.<note place="margin">The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Ebora's</hi> opinion.</note> But immediately Prince <hi>Roderick,</hi> who
very well understood the King, as if he approved that part of the Advise
for the King's Security; tooke the Speech out of the others Mouth, and
by degrees brought it to this, <q>
                     <hi>That he could not but think it unseasonable to
exasperate quiet and obedient Subjects with an Army: thereby ingaging the
Hereticks their Neighbours to assist their Brethren; That the Fire of Civill
War is carefully to be watched, especially in such a place where they are neere,
that feed the flame, and they farre off that must extinguish it, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it can never be extinguished without the Conquerours's Losse. For in the
civill Ruine of Cityes, Men, and Fortunes, the</hi> Prince <hi>loses whatsoever is
taken from the conquered. The Offences till that day committed by the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>country-men,
were sufficiently punished and subdued by his Majestyes
Sister: and if any thing were unsubdued, it was their minds, not their
their bodyes, but those should be conquered not by Armes, but Favours; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more agreeable to the King's Clemency, and to the nature of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>country-men,
of whom his Father</hi> Charles <hi>the Fifth was wont to say, There
is no people under Heaven (so they be fatherly used) that more abhorre ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude,
or more patiently indure it.</hi>
                  </q> Then summing up the expence of an
Army, the Dangers, the Jealousies of Princes, he concluded. <q>
                     <hi>That nothing
was so intricate in the</hi> Low-countryes, <hi>or ravelled into such hard knots,
but might be easily, and gently untyed, without drawing of a sword to cut it.
Certainly forrein Troubles might be composed at distance by a Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diminution to his Authority, reserving his presence for cases of extreame
necessity;</hi>
                  </q> This Counsell of <hi>Roderick Gomez</hi> was the sense of a man po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
at Court, whose principall Aime was peace and quiet; and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Policy to prevent a Warre, where the businesse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fresneda</hi> and <hi>Perez vote</hi> with the Prince.</note> and consequently the
Power should be transferred to others. Of the same opinion was <hi>Bernardo
Fresneda</hi> a plaine and sweete-natured man: and <hi>Anthonio Perez</hi> a Creature
of Prince <hi>Roderick's.</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was for Armes and Revenge,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Alva's</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</note>
as the only cure for Wounds given to Religion and Royall Authority.
For <q>
                     <hi>by other Artifices and facility nothing was effected, but the taking
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41239:94"/>
away obedience from the King, and feare from the Rebells. At first the</hi>
Low-country-men <hi>desired only to be freed of the</hi> Spanish <hi>Garrisons,
and protested nothing else was wanting to quiet the People. But when our
Souldiers were disbanded, were the people quieted? or the rather, and
with the more confidence did they not demand that</hi> Granvell <hi>should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the Governesse and the Helme of State, which he protected:
never desisting, till with base Libells, ridiculous Fooleryes, and traiterous
combinations, at last they extorted their desires. But peradventure
when one man was cast overboard, it laid the wind which raised that popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Tempest? No rather, as Licentiousnesse more easily increases then begins,
having now got ground, as men imboldened by our Gentlenesse, they publish
scurrilous Pamphlets against the Multiplication of Bishopricks, the Revivall
of the Emperours's Edicts, the Councell of</hi> Trent, <hi>and the</hi> Pontifician <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitours;
they petition, but with their swords in their hands; they fright
the Governesse with Threats, and weary the King's patience with obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>inate
and impudent Messages. Whereupon the King, out of his clemency, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
himselfe as a Father, was pleased to moderate some of his Decrees:
and the Governesse to grant something more then she should have done to
such base Petitioners. For what wrought her Indulgence, but only, that when
they had obtained their Requests, by not obeying they forgot themselves to
be subjects, unlearned their Principles of Obedience, and shaking of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
to their Prince, made an Association of the Provinces, as if the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of offendors should secure them: and undervaluing all things humane
and divine, in comparison of the Liberty they had once tasted off. Indeed
his Father</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth, who was not ignorant of the Low-country-men's
natures, had then demonstrated how they should be used, when omitting all
milder remedies he chastised his rebellious Country-men with Armes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd so
reduced them. But now it was not one City, but all the Provinces had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
against God and the King. Nor because the Rebells sit still for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
are their hearts therefore brought downe, but will resume their Armes,
when they are not awed by the Terrour of Revenge. For the most venemous
Serpents may be safely handled in Winter: not that they have lesse Poyson,
but because they are more unactive; it being now known by experience, that
for the same man to be an Heretick and a good Subject is incompossible.</hi>
                  </q>
Thus his riged disposition argued; particularly discoursing how an Army
might be raised and conducted, and disputed all the policies advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for that Expedition, which he, being an old Generall and the rest of
the Lords no Souldiers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Spinosa</hi> and many others go along with the Duke.</note> was of all the councell only able to argue. And
his Judgement was confirmed by Cardinall <hi>Spinosa,</hi> who made a grave
Speech, complaining how the Holy Court of Inquisition was violated in
the <hi>Low-countryes:</hi> The rest were of the same Opinion; all but the Duke
of <hi>Feria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> opposes him,</note> who being nearer in Bloud then Affection to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva,</hi>
and of a milder nature, differed from him altogether: not denying but
<q>
                     <hi>the</hi> Low-countryes <hi>needed some kind of Remedy</hi>
                  </q> (wherein he dissented

                     <hi>but
that Remedy should rather be applyed by dexterity of Counsell, that by force
of Armes; which would be more honourable to the Prince, as if he made it
not a businesse to settle his Dominions, not making himselfe a party, &amp; whilst
fought with his subjects allowing them for his Equalls: and more safe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to his Neighbours, and Enemyes, that would no doubt, make use of

thoughts of Punishment and Warre, let some be sent into the</hi> Low-countryes,
<hi>that may narrowly observe and bring us a true Account of the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Provinces: and let us in the interim give the Subjects Rest,
and time to come to themselves; and take heed, we doe not unseasonably
teach them to use those Armes against his Majesty, which they have imployed
so often in his Service.</hi>

                  </note> These considerations nearly resembling those
offered by Prince <hi>Roderigo,</hi> I suppose the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> purposely kept
back, till the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had spoken; that bringing them in as a new

                     </gap>e Mind.</note> But
the King, though he plainly favoured the Duke of <hi>Alva's</hi> Resolution, yet
being many did oppose it, deferred or seemed to deferre the declaring of
himselfe so long; till every ones benefit should reconcile their diverse and
clashing Opinions. Thus bodyes are dayly formed, when after long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Elements, some parts being remitted, others consumed the
whole is made adequate. For <hi>Roderick Gomez</hi> laboured to keep the King
in <hi>Spaine;</hi> but though he disliked his going into the <hi>Low-countreys</hi> with
an Army, as dangerous, howsoever unnecessary, yet he found this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in it, that if the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> should be <hi>Generall</hi> (which he easily
supposed) it would remove his Rivall from Court, and ingage him in no
slight Difficulties. But <hi>Alva</hi> though, in the first place, he indeavoured to
draw the King from <hi>Spaine,</hi> making sure account he should wholly governe
him in the Army: yet he was well enough pleased to be trusted by the
King, though absent, with the whole Warre; and to leave <hi>Roderick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mez</hi>
behind in whatsoever degree of place or Favour. For as it troubled
him to see the King value his Merits, lesse then the others person: so was
he ambitious of some Imployment, where Warre and the Field might put
a difference between those whom Peace and the Court had equalled.
Their Opinions therefore meeting in this point,<note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to send one before, to make way for his owne march</note> the King without further
delay, declared, That he had long thought of a Expedition into the <hi>Low-countryes,</hi>
and whatsoever was alledged to the contrary, altered not his
Resolution: but yet hee would not goe, till some one sent before him,
should enter the Provinces with an Army; not to affright the Obedience
or Peace of his Subiects with those Armes, but to use them as a Guard
and Ornament to the Prince.<note place="margin">Names the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> for the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> Shortly after calling for the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi>

                  </note> the King immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41239:96"/>
to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> the King had formerly sent Iohn <hi>Acugnia,</hi> and now
dispatched Francis <hi>Ibarra:</hi> that,<note place="margin">Writes to the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> to victuall his men,</note> as the other desired a passage, so this
might procure Victuall for the Army. Moreover <hi>Count Iohn Anguisciola</hi>

Warres, and consequently the unsafenesse of the Passage. Indeed the
Report of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army terrified many Countryes, particularly
<hi>Geneva,</hi>

                     <hi>to
raise an Army, and not let slip such an Opportunity (as fairer could not
be) to revenge himselfe of a Nation that ever hated</hi> France. <hi>It was true, that
the</hi> Spanish <hi>Army, both for the Goodnesse of Souldiers and Noblenesse of
Commanders, was a most select and considerable one, yet in their passage
through the Straits and over the Mountaines; on the one side by the</hi> French,
<hi>on the other by the</hi> Geneveses <hi>and</hi> Swisse, <hi>they might easily be distressed
and cut off. And then all King</hi> Philip's <hi>Spanish and</hi> Italian <hi>Forces being
overthrowne, as it was not to be doubted, but either a way might be opened
to recover</hi> Millaine, <hi>left naked of old Souldiers: or it was but marching into
the</hi> Lowcountreys, <hi>and that people willingly would receiue the</hi> French,
<hi>to whose Armes they must acknowledge themselves obliged for their delivery
from the</hi> Spanish. <hi>But if neither of these Projects tooke effect; yet certainely
for many years a warre was not to be feared from those, that having lost
such an army could not in a long time recruite.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>The Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> added,
that if it would please the King to raise forces for that warre, he would
bring his Maiesty 50000 men. Thus under a specious colour for the publick
safety, they offered his Maiesty the Army which they had privately
designed for their Rebellion, like true Hugonots, who call that the Kings
Security,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>France</hi> finding the <hi>Hugonots</hi> designe, stirrs not.</note> which is indeed his Captivity. But the <hi>French</hi> King knowing
what they aymed at, lest by provoking a Potent Prince, he might at one
time be ingaged in a Forreine and Civill Warre, replyed it was neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable
to the Honour nor Valour of the <hi>French,</hi> to circumvent a King,
neare to him in Affinity and Freindship. But to secure his Kingdome from
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in their March, he would giue Order for the raising of a
new Army. Withall, he signified to King <hi>Philip</hi> the Condition of his Civill
Discords, by reason whereof, he could not promise Security to his Forces
if they came. And now the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> transported in the Galleys of
<hi>Andrea Doria</hi> and <hi>Cosmo</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> with his new <hi>Spanish</hi> Souldiers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41239:96"/>
that were to supply the old <hi>Italian</hi> Garrisons, arrived at <hi>Millaine;</hi> where
falling into a Feauer he was forced to remaine.<note place="margin">Falls sicke at <hi>Millaine.</hi>
                  </note> At which time upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

                  <note place="margin">The Governess likes not the comming of so great an Army, whereupon she writes thus to his Majesty.</note>
and that the King himself would follow (for so it was reported)
the Governesse endeavoured to disswade his Maiesty from coming in a
Warlike manner, which would be of no use, but to imbroile the Provinces
againe. <q>

                     <hi>by which as this Condition was acquired, so it might be preserued
and increased by the King's presence if he came alone: but if he brought
a new and mighty Army, what would it import, but great Expences to the
King, and noe lesse Poverty to the Lowcountryes? Vpon the very Rumour of
a forreine Army diverse Tradesmen and Merchants familyes were now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted;
and when they heard of the Armyes nearer Approcahes, more would
leave the Country, because they knew there would be noe Trading in a time
of Warre and yet they must pay Sessments and great Taxes for maintaining
Souldiers. Besides the Feare of the People, that cannot but thinke these Forces
to be their Executioners; the indignation of the Nobility, whose good Service,
in quieting the late Commotions would seeme to be slighted; and the certaine
Relapse of the Place into Heresy, that would returne into the</hi> Lowcountreys
<hi>with a</hi> Lutheran Army <hi>out of</hi> Germany: <hi>and (which out of the premisses she
prophetically concluded) it would cause, by that inexpiable Hatred &amp; anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
betweene the two Nations, a bloudy Civill Warre for many Ages.
Wherefore she earnestly beseeched his Majesty, that laying aside this unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Designe of Armes, he would come peaceably into the Provinces, more
like a father, then a</hi> King: <hi>and that by his presence and Wisdome he would
add to these happy</hi> Beginnings <hi>what was only desirable,</hi> Continuation.</q> This
Letter the Governesse sent by an Extraordinary, <hi>Gaspar Robley</hi> Lord of

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41239:99"/>
leaving the Pallace to the Governesse. The next day he
sent her the Kings Letters, and a Copy of his Commission, wherein the

upon him, the administration of civill Affayres remaining wholly in the

observing how they looked at this first Ceremony. Indeed the

made an offer of going forward to Receive this stranger, pretended her

that foure dayes before, she had sent into</hi> Spaine Wacken, <hi>Admirall

<hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, his Mother <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Medices,</hi> and

at the Towne of Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> and though they left the Field and fled, and
the Catholiques, by consequence had the victory, yet it was a bloudy one,
the King's Generall <hi>Annas Momorancy</hi> being slaine. Notwithstanding, they
made greater Levyes (for Heresie dayly increased) and receiving strong
Recruits from <hi>Germany</hi> reviv'd the Warre. Which moved the King of

by her Letter; wherein setting down briefly, but not sparingly nor falsly,
all she had done in her nine yeares Government, and by what meanes
the Troubles, continuing for two yeares past, were before the end of <hi>April</hi>
so composed, that she had reduced all the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> by the Help and

unanimously to endeavour the preservation of the State in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and to persist in the Religion of their Ancestours, and their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
to their Prince: from whose merey it was to be hoped that even
the Tratours themselves would be gently punished. That she had in her
Letter to the King delivered her Opinion concerning it, and would write
againe to the like effect, before she departed from them: nor would she
heareafter faile to use her utmost power with her Brother for the Good and
Peace of the Low-countrey-men, whom she so intirely loved. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
a while after she wrote in this manner to his Majesty. <q>
                     <hi>Sir, The

                     <hi>worthy of immortality. But that whilst you give me leave
to depart, you are pleased to increase your royall Favours, by adding, that
for my Governing these Provinces to your mind, you your selfe (so
much it pleases your Clemency to descend) are greatly obliged to me; I
must confesse, nothing could more content me: since in all I have done, I
only proposed to my selfe your Majesties satisfaction, that being the Rule to
all my actions. And if I have my End, I must accompt my Labour gloriously
bestowed. I will not deny, but in this almost nine yeares space, I have gone
through many and grievous Difficulties, most of my Counsellours being either
at variance among themselves, out of their ambitions Emulation: or their
Fidelities by me suspected, at least their Enmity to the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>so that it
was inconvenient for me, not to heare their Advise, and not safe to follow
it. Yet that amidst all this darkenesse, and the subsequent Tempest of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
the Common-wealth was steered and peaceably brought into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
by a woman's hand, but by no humane influence; it is only, (which I
I must acknowledge and reverence) your Piety, for whose sake the Divine
Goodnesse hath assisted me in governing the</hi> Low-countreys <hi>for you. But now
since by Gods grace things are reduced to such a condition, that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
but to punish the Authors of the Troubles, I cannot omit to signifie
to your Majesty, what it is that may chiefly overthrow this present happy
State. Feare of punishment threatned by such an Army, as it hath caused
many, despairing of Pardon, to fly into other Countreys, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of this; so I doubt, it will force the rest, whilst their flight is stopped
and they as it were besieged in the</hi> Low-countreys, <hi>to breake out into more
dangerous Factions and Insurrections. Terrour is not the way to beget re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
in the</hi> Low-countrey-men. <hi>They that advise this rigid Course (I
wish I may be deceived) will purchase</hi> Spaine <hi>more Envy, then Authority.
I am sure it will bring to the</hi> Low countreys, <hi>first, eivill Warre, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiene
Forces, and finally Desolation. Therefore I most humbly beseech your
Majesty, that, in contemplation of God's Mercy and your own, you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
Revenge into a few Examples; and rather desire the Repentance, then
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41239:101"/>
the Punishment of your Subjects. So God Almighty long preserve your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and the Queene, my Lords the Princes, and your little Daughter.</hi>

conceive the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Beginnings</hi> of a Warre to be the same.<note place="margin">l. 3. Hist.</note> For
my owne part,<note place="margin">But improperly.</note> as I will not deny, but that <hi>Alva's</hi> cruell and hatefull Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was the Occasion and Beginning, so I assure my selfe it was not
the <hi>Cause</hi> of the Warre:<note place="margin">A more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deduction.</note> For the cause was much deeper grounded. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> Ambition to command in chiefe, exasperated
with griefe and Anger, heightned by the accesse of Hereticks and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of a Party, men of all qualities ingaging; this was the <hi>Cause,</hi>
which, if it had not then and from that Originall taken fire to kindle a
Warre in a little more time, and from another Place, would have found
combustible matter. Nor can occasion be long wanting to Improbity.
But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his Fact was so fortunate, as to find Patronage in
the Hatred of another. For he, upon the Sentence pronounced by the
Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> against him, his Brother, and many great persons, tooke
up Armes, with so much the fairer pretence, by how much it seemed not
only <hi>just,</hi> but <hi>glorious</hi> to defend himselfe, to recover his owne, and to
vindicate his Associates, his Son, and Countrey in their Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.

               <p>The death of Count <hi>Aremberg</hi> incouraged not the mind of the Prince

indeavoured to perswade him there was no danger of a Tumult in the

affection would disswade them from stirring, lest by a popular offence
they might wrong those Noble-mens private cause. Yet the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>
despising this Advise, as one that long experience had made jealous, and
of his owne nature was averse to other mens counsells, which he looked
upon with the aspect of a retrograd Planet, especially when they offered

                  <q>that they had
plotted with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and other Noble-men, to dispossesse
the King of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> and to divide the Provinces among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
To that end, were their indeavours of expelling cardinall <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,</hi>
who looked into their Designes. Nor would they leave off their
Aenigmaticall Cognizances of Hoods, and Arrowes, the manifest signes
of their Conspiracy, till they had inforced his Majesty to call the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall

out of the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi> That they did not onely know of the

made his Lord privy to his taking of it, was not only not turned away, but
did his ordinary meniall Service, as before. And <hi>Horne,</hi> who was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,

sent by the Governesse to drive <hi>Villers</hi> and the rest of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters

expelling of <hi>Beavor.</hi> That both of them were professed Patrons to the
Covenanters, the Consistorians, and Merchants, promising them to live
and dye with them. That they treated at <hi>Dendermond</hi> with the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> his Brother <hi>Lewis,</hi> Count <hi>Hochstrat,</hi> and some few consede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
to stop the King's passage into the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> and were often
present at such Meetings. That they opposed not the <hi>Gheuses,</hi> when
they plundred Churches, which Picture-scuffle was begun in <hi>Flanders</hi>
Count <hi>Egmont's</hi> Province. And that Count <hi>Horne</hi> had suffered some of

<hi>Ferdinand Martin,</hi> more then once committed to the Jayle

(whereof they themselves were Governours) requiring their Assistance
against those Violaters of holy things. That they had explained the
Governesse's Commands against Hereticks, contrary to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse's

things (of which many Particulars were instanced) contrary to the
Duties of such persons as were Governours of Provinces, Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours,

they interpreted; some they confessed, but alledged they were done le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally.
That they had consulted about changing of their Prince they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely

the Hereticks being there the stronger party. That they justly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41239:109"/>
opposed the Cardinall, as pernicious to the Government of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
That <hi>Casembrot</hi> was retained in <hi>Egmont's</hi> Family, for the Service
he undertooke to do against the Church-Robbers. That <hi>Tournay</hi> being
then well pacified had no use for <hi>Beavor,</hi> and therefore they consulted
about sending him away, especially being requested so to doe, by those
of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </q> Thus in order severally, and respectively, they answered
to the other parts of their Impeachment; which if I should but run over,
would be an infinite worke, Count <hi>Hornes</hi> particular charge consisting
of 600. heades. How they cleared themselves I define not.<note place="margin">Some of these Heads the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernesse had objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them to the King.</note> Truly I know
many of those very Objections were made against them both, to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
by the Governesse. Nay their designe of dividing the Provinces I find
to be discovered euen by the Bishop of <hi>Osnaburg,</hi> in <hi>Westphalia,</hi> who gave
intelligence thereof to the Governesse by <hi>Cobell</hi> one of his Councell; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that he heard it long since from Count <hi>Suarzemburg</hi> cosen to the
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August. 20. 1566.</note> and by <hi>George Holly</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Colonell, when they were
merry at Supper, where they said the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> would put in for
a share. All which the Governesse inserted in her Letters to the King, as we
have related in the yeare 66. Notwithstanding the people giving their
Judgement,<note place="margin">The People doe not thinke them guilty but conceive all this to be the malice of C. <hi>Egmont's</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, <hi>Alva.</hi> Whom the Count had foyled.</note> either out of <hi>hatred</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> or out of <hi>love</hi> to

envied <hi>Egmont,</hi> his old Rivall in the Warres. They likewise reported, that
he bare a grudge to Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> because, long since, the Count won
many thousand Crownes of him at Dice: and afterwards, in a publique
Solemnity, when they shot at markes for a wager, the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> lost it,
the <hi>Low-countrey-men</hi> shouting for Joy, that one of their Nation had the
victory over a <hi>Spanish</hi> Generall. Which Stories either false, or little tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
matters, yet remembred by the vulgar, were brought in, to foment
their pitty. And I verily believe in the processe of this Triall,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> not so culpable in this, as some imagine. <hi>In Adriaenus Stope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> a greater
<hi>Odium</hi> was cast upon the Duke, then he deserved. Nay I have read, how
it was affirmed by very worthy men, that after their sentence was
brought out of <hi>Spaine, Alva</hi> wrote to the King; that he was every day
slower to put it in execution, because he fore-saw what mischiefe would
insue: and that the King, incensed against <hi>Egmont</hi> (partly for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of his Faith made when he was in <hi>Spaine,</hi> but not performed, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the many complaints against him,<note place="margin">See the yeare, 65.</note> writ to his Majesty by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and aggravated by Cardinall <hi>Spinosa,</hi> then the great man at Court)
blamed the Duke of <hi>Alva's</hi> Slackness, &amp; commanded him according to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Order, forwith to dispatch him. Yet the <hi>Duke</hi> deferred execution, til
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> invading <hi>Brabant,</hi> he was forced to meet him with his

who never aimed at any thing but your Majestyes Service; for advancement
whereof, as my past Actions testify, I neither spared my paines nor fortunes;
but to a thousand dangers have exposed my life, which never was so pretious
to me, but that if it might any way be offensiue to your Majesty, I would
a hundred times before this have exchanged it for death. Therefore I doubt
not, but when you shall fully understand the Carriage of Businesse in these
parts, you will clearly perceiue how iniuriously I have beene used, whilst
they have perswaded your Majesty against me, in things that never entred
my Imagination. I call God to witnesse; and I pray that he will revenge it
upon my soule, that must this day appeare before his Iudgment-Seat, if
I have neglected any part of that, which I beleive'd to be my Duty towards
my King, and Country. I therefore beseech you, Sir, I, that shall petition your
Majesty no more, that for the Reward of all my painefull Services, you will
please a little to commiserate my Wife, and eleven Children, with the rest
of my Family, which I have commended to some few Friends yet left me
And presuming your Majesty, out of your native Clemency will not deny
me this, I go to suffer death, which I willingly imbrace, assuring my selfe
my end will give many satisfaction. From Bruxells the fifth of Iune, at
two of the clock after midnight, in the yeare 1568. Your Majesties most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

lest in that darke weather his Souldiers, by an errour not to be repaired,
might be ingaged in blind cosening holes, and pits, which the Countrey
was every where full of. But five dayes after, his Excellence compleated
his Victory. For commanding <hi>Caesar Davalo,</hi> Brother to the Marquesse

and the newes being purposely divulged through the Army, so inflamed
the Souldiers courages, that almost all the Captaines, with great contest
which Nation should be honoured with the Service, begged leave to fall

received them more gratiously, and publiquely explained her selfe, that
she understood the money appertained not to the King, (whom she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had any Intention to wrong in any kind) but to the <hi>Genoa</hi>-Merchants:
that she had use for it at the present, and would hereafter returne it to the
owners faithfully,<note place="margin">Barberino's <hi>Relation.</hi>
                  </note> and with interest. This Answer was reported to the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva,</hi> from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadour and <hi>Vitelli,</hi> by <hi>Barberino,</hi>
who advised him (notwithstanding the <hi>Queene</hi> intended not Repayment,
since no Merchant could demand the Money) to take into consideration
whether the <hi>Low-countrey-men</hi> or the <hi>English</hi> would be more prejudiced
by the Quarrell. And further told his Excellence, that he had taken notice
of 80. <hi>Low-countrey</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships under Arrest in the <hi>English</hi> Ports,
their lading dayly decaying, and imbezelled. And therefore the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
and <hi>Vitelli</hi> held it best, that matters should not be aggravated
with new causes of offence, for they hoped that in a little time, the
fury of both sides being allayed by mutuall Losses, at last with equall
Dissimulation they would fall to their antient intercourse. For the Duke's
better satisfaction therein,<note place="margin">The Originall Strada saies he hath by him.</note> he delivered him a Breviate, wherein he had
stated the controversie. All this was truth, as afterwards appeared when
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41239:118"/>
the contestation being ended, the losse of the <hi>Low-countrey</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi>
Merchants was found so farre to exceed the damage of the <hi>English,</hi> as these
were forced to refund above 200000. Florens. Neverthelesse <hi>Alva</hi> would
not desist, either from revenging the Injury done by <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nothing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</note> or
from exacting the Tribute he had begun to demand of the <hi>Low-countreys.
That,</hi> he thought, concerned the King in point of honour: and though
he knew <hi>this</hi> for the present would hinder the Exchange and Traffick, yet
he hoped those Losses would be soone repaired. Especially, since his
mony was interecep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed by the <hi>English,</hi> he held it just to aske Supplies from
the <hi>Low-countrey-men,</hi> for whose benefit that money should have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.
When the Duke therefore to his Requests and Admonitions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Threats, &amp; the Estates pretended the People's wants; there was a note
subscribed with an unknowne name scattered in the Presence,<note place="margin">The D. of <hi>Alva</hi> proceeds in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting Tribute from the <hi>Low-countrey men.</hi>

                     <hi>the

by their intelligence, that <hi>Alva</hi> had but a little time to stay among them,
which the People wished, and therefore easily believed: so as their feare
of a falling man was lesse; and his indignation greater, in regard he thought
they insulted over his departure.</p>

of the provinces. For upon All-Saints Eue, the Sea excessively swelling and

Cattell, House-hold-goods, and broken ribbs of Ships, floated over the

affirme, presenting to the eye a modell of <hi>Noah's</hi> Flood. I find in the
History of <hi>Friezland</hi> that many men, who had climed to the tops of Hilles

the Souldiers were in Armes, and the Hang-man ready with a Rope, when
the Messenger that brought newes of the taking of <hi>Brill</hi> by the <hi>Gheuses,</hi>
like a god coming downe upon the Stage, untyed the knot of that intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and dismall Tragedy. For <hi>Alva</hi> struck with that unexpected losse, at
last gave over the odious dispute; for two yeares together continued with
no other fruit, but that, aggravating their hatred to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
the Plot of their Revolt. Indeed it plainely appeared, how great
a provocation to Rebellion Taxes are, when people having other grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
have that burthen added. For the <hi>Low-countrey-mens</hi> complaints of
<hi>Alva's</hi> Pride and Cruelty went no further then hate and execration; so
that lately when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> came with an Army, the Cities,
though offended with the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> sent no Assistance to the Prince.
For punishment falls but upon a few; and by how much it spurrs on the
multitude with hatred, by so much it curbes them with feare. But Taxes
are accompted every man's particular Losse, and they that be therewith
grievously oppressed, lose their <hi>feare</hi> together with their <hi>fortunes;</hi> and
not regarding future prejudice, seeke a Generall, meerely to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

it is to no purpose, so long as the humour that hath weakened the people,

their <hi>Feare;</hi> the people growing more confident when they heard
that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva</hi> must be gone. Then the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> knew his
time was come for maturing a Rebellion; and founding of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he had long designed. Therefore whilst <hi>Alva</hi> fixt all his Care
upon raising the Taxes, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> laid hold of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

by the secret Intelligence which he had with many Townes, ready to

the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> as for so many yeares space could never be put out with
the ruines of battered Cities, nor extinguished with a torrent of bloud.</p>

which grew worse &amp; worse, till in a most wretched manner,<note place="margin">They yield to mercy.</note> consumed with
famine, they were by God's just judgment, forced to yield to mercy. For 'tis
evident, that of 1600. Garrison-Souldiers (to which number they were
reduced when the City was rendred, whereas at the begining of the
Siege they were 4000.) scarce 700.<note place="margin">Very many put to death,</note> escaped with life. The other 900.

to be put to the sword, or hanged, or drown'd (which fatall Spectacle

The Siege of <hi>Harlem</hi> was memorable for many Passages.<note place="margin">The remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Accidents hapning at this Siege.</note> They revived

Townes of their owne party, some of these Pidgeons, which afterwards
being dispatcht away when necessity required, with letters fastned under
their wings, remembring their severall Masters houses and their young
ones, they flew back to <hi>Harlem.</hi> By these winged postes the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> incouraged the Townsmen to hold out for the last three months:
till one of them, tired with flying, lighted upon a Tent, and being shot
by a Souldier, ignorant of the Stratagem, the Mystery of the Letters was
discovered. After that accident, no Pidgeon could flie over the Leaguer,
though not of that kind, but the Souldiers would strive who should kill
her.<note place="margin">A Regiment of Women.</note> The <hi>Harlemers</hi> likewise had a gallant Regiment of Women, that in
repairing the breaches, and defending of the Workes, might compare
with the industry of the men. Their Colonel was onely <hi>Goody Kemava,</hi> a
woman of a manly spirit, neare upon 50. yeares of age. Under her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and conduct they were imboldened to doe Souldiers Duties at the

Quarters, to the no lesse incouragement of their owne men, then admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Enemy.<note place="margin">The wilfulnesse and cruelty of the <hi>Harlemers.</hi>
                  </note> Yet nothing was more admirable, then the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
obstinacy, who, notwithstanding they had lost three great Armies,
and had hardly any shelter within their Walls, shot through, as they say
in ten thousand, three hundred, and sixty places; yet would not heare of
a Treaty, or conditions. And when the Garrison was brought to a <hi>small
number:</hi> both day and night upon the Walls they so well performed the
dutyes of <hi>many,</hi> that if at any time the King's men chanced to appeare
never so little above their Trenches, they were in a moment taken off
with Musket-bullets, and those shot, as for a wager, from many parts at
once. Nay, I have heard, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Souldiers partly to mocke the
enemy, partly to make them spend their powder, would many times put
their Helmets upon faggot-sticks, so as they might be seen but to cock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Workes: which in an instant were shot at and hit by the Besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Lastly, though they were inforced by famine, for the two last months
to eat Mice, old Shooes, and every nasty thing: yet they lost not their
fury, resolving to sally out, and rather die fighting, then, by yielding to
mercy, have their throats cut like beasts; and they had done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but that as they marched out of the Port, their Wives and Children,
with pittifull Shriekes and imbraces, stayed them. To conclude,<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Harlem</hi> and <hi>Sancerre.</hi>
                  </note> the
Siege of <hi>Harlem</hi> was rendred Illustrious by the resemblance it bare to the

and their Religion: both,<note place="margin">Compared.</note> because at first they were in vaine attempted by
the Royall Party, were no more assaulted, but carefully close besieged.
The Women of both Townes, with like courage tooke up Armes: there
was a kind of <hi>Kennava</hi> at <hi>Sancerre</hi> that perswaded &amp; gave example to the
rest. Both Towns shewed like obstinacy, <hi>that</hi> holding out ten Months, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly
hoping for reliefe from the <hi>Rochellers; this</hi> as long, &amp; as idly, relying
on the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> At last both Garrisons, conquered by Famine,
in the same Month of August, almost upon the same day, rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
<hi>Sancerre</hi> upon Articles, <hi>Harlem</hi> to Mercy. But in <hi>that,</hi> more

put an end to the Warre of <hi>Granada,</hi> where he was Generall of the

Age wherein he lived, had not any other that commanded in chiefe so long
and in such various places. The common saying among Souldiers, that a

this of whom we speak, <hi>Ferdinando</hi> Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi> Both of them constantly
followed the Warres from their Infancy, even to their decrepit Age: he
being almost fourescore, this 74. yeares old, inlarging their honours by
continuall imployments. <hi>Momorancy</hi> under foure Kings of <hi>France</hi> fought
eight Battailes; in foure wherof he commanded in chiefe. <hi>Alva</hi>
serving the Emperour <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> and his Son King <hi>Philip,</hi> in
<hi>Germany, Africa, Italy,</hi> the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> was Generall
in the greatest expeditions. But the <hi>French man</hi> was more
<hi>active</hi> by the <hi>Genius</hi> of his Nation; by his owne, more <hi>unfortunate:</hi>
as being seldome Master of the Field, three times taken prisoner, and
at last slaine. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> oftner by delaies then Fighting, gained
glory out of the Successe of his Actions. In warlike Abilities they
are accompted rather <hi>equall,</hi> then <hi>like.</hi> But <hi>Alva</hi> was as good a Souldier at

he was an earnest Suiter to the King, that in his March he might kisse his
Royall hand, being not yet fully assured of his Pardon, his Request was
denyed. And at the same time, when the Nobility of <hi>Spaine</hi> were sent for
by the King to sweare Allegiance to <hi>Didaco</hi> Prince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> though the
Duke moved for Leave to be present at the Solemnity, yet the same sterne
nature of the King would not admit him. So much his Majesty confided

That Citie, the head not onely of <hi>Walcharen,</hi> but of all the <hi>Isles</hi> of

little fights, rather to make show of confidence, then out of any reall trust
in his own strength, had now for almost two years defended it against the
<hi>Zelanders.</hi> To mollifie that people (incensed against <hi>Alva,</hi> but said to be
well-affected to the new Governour) when <hi>Requesenes</hi> had often sent them
very kind Letters, by messengers assuring them of the Kings mercy, all
would not do; for having made themselves masters of many small Towns,
the successe ticing them on, they placed greater hopes in their own stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
then in the Kings <hi>unfruitfull</hi> mercy; and according to the custome of

washt his wounds, the Countreymen looking for bootie, barbarously killed

eloquution, but of a turbulent spirit: And as his brother the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> and he were twins in affection, so in prudence they seemed utter
strangers: this being inconsiderately violent, and making warre rather in
hot bloud, then with advice, had often (and deservingly) the experience of
ill fortune. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> took all their Colours, Artillery, Tents and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
with little or no losse to themselves.<note place="margin">To whom this victory is to be ascribed.</note> Now the honour of this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
(as it is common in all good successes) was by many challenged: the
Souldiers preferring their Commanders with great contest of severall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> attributed the glory of the day, solely to their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Avila,</hi> who as wisely as expeditiously gave battell. The <hi>Low-countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
to <hi>Aegidius</hi> Sonne to Count <hi>Barlamont</hi> and Lord of <hi>Hierg,</hi> who with his

his Lanceirs into many little Troops, galled the enemy so subtilly,
and so often, in the Flank, that he overcame by art the farre greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
For my own part, as I doubt not but every battell is wonne by many
mens valours, so I am confident this was chiefly gained by <hi>Montius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
King <hi>Philip</hi> for this very service assigned him a yearly pension of five

Lanceirs charged them with so much violence and judgement, that
the <hi>Raiters</hi> being disordered in the Front (an accident which hath lost many
Fields) sixty of them were severed from the rest, which he (assisted by a

fired, in hope to recover their Poste; but their Retreat was obstructed by his
pikes, and they to a man all slain. Whereupon the whole Regiment grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and <hi>Anthonio Olivera,</hi> that joyned their Troops to receive his charge, he
not onely not repressed the fear of his men, but flying with them, was forced
to yield to the impression of the enemie. Some Writers say, this was the first
battell,<note place="margin">Benard Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza. l. 2.</note> wherein the Lanceirs routed the Carabines. But I observe, that in
the battell near <hi>Renty</hi>-Castle in <hi>Artois,</hi> the Emperours <hi>Raiters</hi> were worsted
by the <hi>French</hi> Lanceirs.<note place="margin">Perotti's <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</hi>
                  </note> But <hi>Perrotti</hi> in this likewise had the greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Field, because when he had broke his Lance, going to draw his
sword; and perceiving that it was shot from his side, he catched a Raiter in
his Arms, wrested his sword out of his hand, and killing him with his own
weapon, made his way through the thickest of the enemie; where being
shot through the reins, he would not yet leave the field, whilst the victory
continued doubtfull, but when it was absolutely wonne, almost dead, he
was carried off the Field. Yet within a while he recovered, with so much
the greater joy to his fellow-souldiers, because most of them had spoken
his funerall praise. To the fame whereof, he added so much by his valiant
actions under the Command of <hi>Alexander Farneze,</hi> that from his excessive
strength and courage he was sirnamed the <hi>Palladine</hi> of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fruit of so great a day was almost lost by a furious mutiny of the

Nothing it seems is more inconsiderable then Souldiers lives. And is it lawfull for
a Generall, every houre to require the souldiers lives, but not lawfull for them to
challenge their livelihood, and many moneths Debentures of the Generall? is there
any kind of workmen that may justlier demand their wages then they, that serve not

when he had made a very sad and long speech to them, they answered

to admit them: and quartering themselves in the richest Citizens houses,
they peremptorily threatned <hi>Requisenes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their threats.</note> who upon their requests and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces
had now sent out of the Town the Garrison of <hi>Walloons,</hi> that if he
would not pay their arrears, they would be their own Pay-masters. And
when he had appointed a certain day, yet failed; with new fury, as if they
had been deluded, they ran armed to the Court of Justice, where their <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto</hi>
was hearing causes,<note place="margin">Their solemn Oath.</note> and there presently setting up an Altar, when Masse
was done, they all bound themselves by oath to obey the <hi>Electo,</hi> and not to
lay down arms till they had their pay to a <hi>Maravedi.</hi> Which very Act pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not tumultuously in that tumult, but orderly and gravely, as if there had
been no sedition. So must armed rage be ordered, lest it rage in vain. Nay,
they set up a Gallows on the place, and made Proclamation in the <hi>Electo's</hi>
name,<note place="margin">Their Edict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst plunder.</note> That whosoever for the future stole or plundred, should be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

flush of money, were followed, as the custome is, by many poor people for
their alms, particularly by the begging Fryers. And most of the souldiers
then full of gold (for some had got three years Debentures, some four)
either out of that Nations inbred pietie rowards Religious Orders, or
that when wealth comes on the sudden it is lesse regarded, were so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
that the <hi>Franciscans</hi> for their part got four thousand Florens.<note place="margin">How much the <hi>Franciscans</hi>

                     </gap>ad of them.</note> But when
the souldiers took notice, that among all the Religious which had tasted of
their bonnty, no one of the Society of <hi>Iesus</hi> came unto them, to which
Order, for their constant pains in the Camp, and their extraordinary care of
the sick souldiers, they acknowledged themselves chiefly obliged: they
sent one of the Army to encourage the Fathers,<note place="margin">They invite the <hi>Jesuits.</hi>
                  </note> in that publick Donation,
not to let themselves onely be pretermitted. But the Fathers giving thanks
to the Messenger,<note place="margin">Who refuse to come at them.</note> when they could not otherwayes put him off, at last ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
denied to take any thing of those men, till they had restored all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41239:131"/>
their plunder to the true owners. The Armie nothing at all offended, or
retarded, choosing two of their number for Collectours, gathered a very
great summe,<note place="margin">They send money to the <hi>Jesuites</hi> Colledge.</note> and sent it to their Colledge, assuring themselves <hi>ready</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
would not be so refused, as when it was onely <hi>promised.</hi> The Fathers
admired the souldiers constancie, whom they imagined to have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with their former Answer: and Ceremonies having passed on both
sides, held it their dutie to instruct those preposterously pious men, and in a
friendly manner to rectifie either their errour, or their contumacie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one of the Societie, in great credit with the Armie, went to them, and
speaking freely,<note place="margin">An exhortation made them by one of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> made them understand, <hi>That his Order refused not their Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
as if it would not come seasonably to supply their necessities; but God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
was not pleased with those that give out of other mens fortunes. They
should remember themselves how long, and how profusely they had lived in</hi> Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,
<hi>keeping possession of the Townsmens houses; how threatningly and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in the beginning of the mutiny, some of them had seized upon the citizens
Estates. Why then should they seek out persons profusely to bestow their money on,
and in the mean time injuriously passe by those to whom it was iustly due? Rather
in that distribution, they should use care and method, and relieving the wants of the
poor Townsmen, recover the good opinion of the City, and save their own soule, and
reputations.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fruits of it.</note> This was not spoke in vain to the souldiers, that likewise by this
Argument of Bounty, endeavoured to excuse the necessitie of their past a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.<note place="margin">They give and restore very much to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</note>
Wherefore some of the chief among them, either touched with
Religion, or to cancell the Ignominy of Sedition, by a new example, gave
largely to the Citizens, and began to restore many things got by violence:
with so great admiration and applause of the Magistrates, that they ordered
a Publick Speech should be made to the People, wherein the Army should
be praised, and the pains taken and moderation used by the Fathers of the
Societie, specified and commended. But <hi>Requesenes</hi> not yet confiding in the
Army, having pardoned and buried the memory of their fault, sent them
back to the siege of <hi>Leyden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leyden.</note> which the year before was begun by the Duke
of <hi>Alva:</hi> the Governour being now dis-engaged from much fear and care,

neighbouring city, where his Mistresse lived, a noble Ladie of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
(married to him not long after) whom he was then a suiter to, often
waiting upon, and courting her, according to the freedome used in the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi>
By chance, the day before he was to storm the Town, <hi>Valdez</hi>
feasted his Mistresse at the <hi>Hague:</hi> and observing her to look sad, importuned
her to acquaint him with the cause; She said, It was not possible but she
must be in great anxiety, having before her eies the image of <hi>Leyden,</hi> desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to spoil and plunder the next day. For so many funeralls of her friends
and acquaintance, as must necessarily be involved in the publick ruine, were
they not sufficient at the present, with onely Fear and Imagination, to banish
all joy from her mind; and afterwards when she had news of the success, to
give her heart a wound incurable? <hi>Valdez,</hi> lest he should loose the hope of
his marriage, beseeched her to be more chearfull, and made her a secret pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to recall his orders for storming, and for her love to spare the lives of
that obstinate Citie. Which he promised the more freely, in regard he
knew the Town would fall of it self, though he held his hand, and saved his
souldiers bloud. For very hunger would make them yield, and the thought
of it would be taken as a favour from him; though he did it upon his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

like a Show in a <hi>Romane</hi> Theatre, where the Scene was miraculously
changed, and Ships fought to make them sport; if they had not likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
their danger, from that unwonted spectacle, and the Auxiliarie forces
of that confederated element, had not been directed against themselves: so
that all hope was cut off for taking the Town,<note place="margin">And over the fields to <hi>Leyden</hi>
                  </note> now victualled by so many
Ship-ladings of Provision. For to bring relief, it was wonderfull to see how
many sail appeared, furnished with men and ordnance, from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ports and Islands, by a generall confederacie; and with no less hatred to

the <hi>Romane</hi> Religion: which many publickly gloried in, wearing <hi>half-moons</hi>

that in some places,<note place="margin">Bern. Mend. l. 12.</note> when they wanted spades to cast up earth against the

in their breast-plates,<note place="margin">The like wonder of old.</note> and helmets. The like, upon the same necessitie, was
done of old in the same Countrey,<note place="margin">Caesar. lib. 5. de bell. Gall.</note> by the <hi>Nervians,</hi> when they besieged

by <hi>Valdez,</hi> who too late repented the lost opportunitie of taking the

the ditches,<note place="margin">Not without losse.</note> after four moneths raised the siege. Nor did he flie without
loss, the enemie chasing him with <hi>Grapples</hi> in their hands, that is, long poles
headed with iron hooks, or hooks at the end of long ropes, wherewith they
angled for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> grievously wounding them, and drawing up many
of them prisoners to the Ships.<note place="margin">Bern. Mend. l. 12.</note> At which time, it was an admirable passage,

fellows to defend a Bridge, was struck at from one of their boats with four
grapples, which catching hold, drew him up dead to all appearance. But
when they had him aboard, and that he saw them (being six or seven) bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
fishing for others, he rose at their backs, and taking a hatchet that by
chance lay before his feet, with his full strength (for he was onely dragged
by his clothes, his flesh being scarce touched) knocked down one, then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
so a third; the rest astonished at the fury of the revived man, leaped
into the water, <hi>Ciaconio</hi> left alone in the Hoigh, as it was laded with corn

to his vanquished fellow-souldiers.</p>
               <p>The misfortune of the siege was augmented by a fresh mutinie of the

<hi>Valdez</hi> was not guilty of that crime, for Avarice never had power over him;
and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> then were simple, and knew not how to treat with bribes;
notwithstanding the rumour was believed, or rather forged by such as
were ignorant of the true cause, but would not have the improsperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
imputed unto themselves. And they were glad of such an occasion
to demand pay of their Generall,<note place="margin">They take him prisoner.</note> full of money as they thought.<note place="margin">Utrecht.</note> The flame

Fame had reported him slain by the way, and his Regiment dispersed:
and there was something in it. For whilst he rode before his men, onely with
two or three in his Companie, just as he entered the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> he was
set upon, by almost 600 souldiers, which had run away from the battell of

resolved to carry the warre as farre as <hi>Schelt,</hi> not through the open Sea (for

impassable, save by boat: and lastly, by how much surer they were (having
the enemy on the front, and the sea (a crueller enemie) in the rere) that if

we can meet nothing impervious to us, or insuperable. Though our attempt
be great, my mates, yea so great as almost exceeds belief, that we should pass a foot

We have the day, my mates, wherein the heavens are concerned, as much

But not without much delay. And with no small loss of the Kings men,
could these rocks of the Enemy, and this dreadfull tempest be avoided:
Wherefore the tide rising and raging,<note place="margin">The Rere forced to return.</note> 
                  <hi>Peralta</hi> with the Rere had gone but a

what was due to their extraordinary labours, and unprendented courage in

But whatever end the</hi> Lowcountrey <hi>men had therein, they had forborn at first

in effect, that you, dismissing your Garrisons, might with more<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Plots and Stratagems of turbulent persons: injoying at present a kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
during pleasure; and upon the first breath of the giddie multitude, none at all.
We are deceived if we hope this people, differing from us in Manners and Language,
many of them in Religion, all in Resentment of our Countreymens late victory,
will be governed of their own accord, without the terrour of our arms. They ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
with an armed Governour, what will they do when he is disarmed? Let

Power, not Courage; to whom it belongs to</hi> give, <hi>not to</hi> receive <hi>the Law. But they
are resolved, except this be granted them, not to</hi> admit <hi>a Governour: Let them
be</hi> compelled. <hi>If it be disputed by the sword, can our men and theirs have other
thoughts, then such as are familiar to the Conquerours, and the conquered? If
you seek praise by this Indulgence, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver hasty, and will be of no long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuence
with proud people, made impudent by our modestie. These names of</hi> huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<hi>and</hi> favour, <hi>will shew more noble after a victory, when they are demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
not of Necessitie, but Moderation. It may be objected, that some good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
well-wishers to the Royall party, would have all forreiners disbanded. I
would gladly know these</hi> Low-countrey-<hi>Royallists; for I am told many live with
us at Court, whose hearts are in</hi> Holland <hi>with the Prince of</hi> Orange; <hi>whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and indeavours to send away the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>the more they appear, the more
ought such friends to be suspected. I am sure the King your brother, when he was
in the</hi> Netherlands, <hi>promised the</hi> Low-countreymen <hi>to free them of the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards;
<hi>but observing a generall conspiracie to eject them, that very unanimous
consent made him pause upon it, and deferre his Grant, till the Governesse, the
Dutchesse of</hi> Parma, <hi>wonne him by her intreaties. And yet the</hi> Low-countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<hi>were not then minded to rebell. Now, by the example of the wisest King,
you see what is the best course for you, that have not obliged your self by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to this publickly offended and armed Nation. I have said thus much,
taking it for granted, that you can at pleasure presently draw our men
from their Garrisons, and send them out of the</hi> Low-countreys: <hi>What, if
upon knowledge of your agreement with the</hi> Low-countreymen, <hi>made upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of their banishment, they should mutiny, to which they are too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41239:144"/>
and refuse to deliver up the Forts and Cities? truly then you will
lose both the respect of your own souldiers, as if you preferred the</hi> Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen
<hi>before them and yet, as if you had but mockt the</hi> Low-countreymen,
<hi>aggravate their hatred. Lastly, I will never perswade you, the Brother to my King,
to receive the Government of the Provinces on poorer terms, then his Majesties
servants,</hi> Alva <hi>and</hi> Requesenes. But <hi>Escovedo</hi> was clear of another opinion.
And having sounded the Princes inclination, began securely in this manner.
<hi>I shall rather be willing to shew your Highness what I</hi> conceive,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Escovedo</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues for it,</note> 
                  <hi>then what I dare</hi>
advise, <hi>because You are still accustomed, to allow the freedom of my counsels: as I am
to admire the wisdome of your Resolutions. And I shall at present, the freelier
expresse my self, in regard it will, I presume, be thought a greater truth, which a</hi>
Spaniard <hi>is forced to speak against his Countrey-men. But even our Countrey must
give place unto necessity. Nor in consultations, is Reason at all times permitted to
make a free Election; but by necessitie we are often circumscribed; at which times,
men that shun a tempest must count any poor Creek a Haven. Almost all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
as well the Clergie, as the Laitie, in the Pacification of</hi> Gant, <hi>have agreed
to out the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>and sworn not to admit of any Governour over the</hi> Low-countreys,
<hi>till all forrein souldiers be disbanded. Wherein their resolutions are so
fixed and immoveable, that we may despair of winning the</hi> Low-countreys <hi>by
any Avenue, but this; which according to</hi> Gonzaga's <hi>opinion, we should open with
our swords. But you,</hi> Gonzaga, <hi>speak what becoms an old Commander to promise,
especially to an invincible Generall. Nor do I doubt, but if occasion should be, you
would gallantly perform, what you have gloriously advised. But I, that perhaps
more timerously, not lesse circumspectly, consider our present condition, hold it our
best to try all wayes before we make use of Violence and Arms. And this you know
is the Kings Pleasure, and Command. For what, I pray you, have our men all this
while effected in the</hi> Netherlands? <hi>The Duke of</hi> Alva <hi>coming in, with the fame
of so great forces, so many victories, feared for the shedding of so much</hi> Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-<hi>bloud,
at last losing all the Sea-coast, and the strongest Provinces, left the</hi>
Low-countreys, <hi>which he found entire, dismembred. And yet in all the time of</hi>
Alva, <hi>and his Successour, (whose fortune was little better) most part both of the</hi>
Netherlands <hi>and the</hi> Belgick <hi>Nobility, bore Arms for the King. Now you see
how the</hi> Low-countrey-men <hi>have deserted us. Of all the Provinces onely two
continue loyall; the rest, if force be offered, are now bound by Oath to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by Arms. Which is the very thing the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>wishes. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
for a warre he cunningly contrives; and this alone, if he were present at our
Consultation, he would endeavour to perswade, not the dismissing of the</hi> Spaniards.
<hi>For your Hignesse may be confident, that he therefore perswaded the</hi> Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
<hi>to this course, because he feared nothing more then your Admission; inserting
that clause in the Pacification of</hi> Gant, <hi>which he hoped you never would allow; and
so, excluded from the Government, be presently necessitated to a Warre, which that
ambitious man might at his pleasure manage. But this cunning Artist must be
fooled, and contrary to his exspectancy, by approving the Pacification of</hi> Gant,
<hi>your Highnesse will be invested in the Government of the</hi> Low-countreys.
<hi>Whereto being once admitted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca l. 9. de Clementia.</note> 
                  <hi>you by your clemency and gentlenesse may bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who if their usuall receits fail, use to prescribe contraries: and by the same
Rule, when Severity could not do his businesse, he should try what might be done by
clemency.</hi> Cesar <hi>followed his wifes advice; and thenceforth all conspiracies cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
the Senate and People of</hi> Rome <hi>were loyall and obedient to him. And truly,
if any man may go this way with hope of happier successe, it is your Hignesse one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41239:144"/>
To passe by your being a</hi> German <hi>born, sonne to a</hi> Low-countrey <hi>Prince, for
which they must needs love you more then any of their</hi> Spanish <hi>Governours: The
fame of your actions, your deportment, (which how it hath wrought in mens minds
you by experience know) your Aspect lovely even in your enemies eyes, will no doubt
gain you the Affection, Duty, and Obedience of this people. The nature of the</hi> Low-countreymen
<hi>is easiest cured with lenitives: if violence be offered they will strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle;
they are to be lead, not driven. Besides the greatest persons will hasten the
tender of their services to you, that the former crimes of Rebellion may be imputed
not to their contumacy, but anothers pride. One Act there is that may extinguish
all their Love, the retaining of forrein souldiers. The</hi> Low-countreymen <hi>have
still before their eyes the figure of</hi> Antwerp <hi>burning, the slaughter of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and rifling of their Goods. Their implacable hatred to the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>if
you keep them here, will likewise reach your self. For they that hate your armie
cannot love your Person. Nor can you be ever safe among those subjects, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think themselves secure among your souldiers. For securitie is established by
a mutuall safeguard. And therefore if the</hi> Low-countreymen <hi>desire the cause
of their late Quarrels may be removed out of their sight, grant their Request; and
what they perhaps may force you to by arms, make it your favour to them. By which
favour you will both immortally oblige the</hi> Low-countreymen <hi>to You, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
indear your self to the King your Brother, weary of the cares and charges of
the warre, by pacifying the</hi> Low-countreys <hi>without arms. Nor is it greatly to
be feared, that the</hi> Spaniards <hi>should refuse to go upon your Command, now the
King approves the discharge of forreiners: for the Obedience which they formerly
shewed to the Dutchesse of</hi> Parma, <hi>questionlesse they will not now deny to you, and to
the King himself. But when the</hi> Spaniards <hi>shall be dismissed, if there be danger,
the</hi> Low-countreymen <hi>solicited by the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>may soon forget this
Act of Grace; shall we therefore conclude, that we must necessarily be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by their fraud, and oppressed by their arms? Are not the Loyall Provinces
able to sustain the first charge of an insurrection, till Forces can be sent for, out of</hi>
Burgundy <hi>had at hand, and out of</hi> Germany <hi>not farre off? And then, we have
so much more reason to look for good successe, by how much we shall be assisted
with a more powerfull armie sent from the King, in defence of his own commands;
and we may with more justice punish the perfidious Rebels. Wherefore in a word,
I deny not, but the forrein souldiers whether retained or dismissed may somewhat
indanger us:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">If the <hi>Spanish</hi> be retained.</note> 
                  <hi>but when I see on the one side a certain warre, and the Kings cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
displeasure, no help; and on the other, that you are offered the possession of
the Government,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">If they be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed.</note> 
                  <hi>hope of quieting the</hi> Low-countreys, <hi>the Kings favour and
assistance, and consequently, if a warre should break forth, that which would much
conduce to victorie; I think in point of discretion this ought to be preferred before
the contrarie.</hi>

For if he,<note place="margin">His Reaons.</note> by keeping them, should have interrupted the peace of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi>
which his Majestie had particularly recommended to him; he
might well suspect,<note place="margin">Fear of the King.</note> it would be whispered in the Kings ear (open to such
kind of jealousies) that by laying the plot for a warre, he was ambitious of
new power and greater fortunes. Besides he longed exceedingly for the

suffered to live no where? Sixteen years ago, the Governesse, Margaret of</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,
<hi>had turned them out of the</hi> Low-countreys, <hi>and now this Governour,</hi> Don
John <hi>of</hi> Austria, <hi>had again expelled them; with so much the greater dishonour,
by how much there was then a fairer pretence for the Kings sending them into</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,
<hi>to recrueit his Armie. But now plainly, by publick Edict, they (who
alone in the</hi> Low-countreys <hi>had maintained the Kings Right) were now, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
declared Enemies to the King and the</hi> Low-countreys, <hi>and by a common
confederation of the Provinces, expelled; as if Peace and a</hi> Spaniard <hi>could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite
there together.</hi> Thus they discoursed, though discontentedly, not
threatningly, yet furie, as the custome is, by meeting others, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41239:145"/>
their Grievances,<note place="margin">They begin to mutiny.</note> increased: the nearer the day of their departure
came (grief making them still more sensible of their condition) the more
obstinate they shewed themselves; especially at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and late victory had so elevated them, as there was little hope they
would easily deliver up the Fort. But the care of the vigilant Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and Reverence to the Royall bloud, among the loyall Regiments
trained in the old Discipline, prevailed so much, that by degrees the love
of Obedience returned, and <hi>Iuan Escovedo,</hi> a very prudent man, sent post to
<hi>Antwerp</hi> by Don <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Escovedo <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to pacifie them.</hi>
                  </note> appeased the Mutiniers with an apposite Oration.
For after he had read the Kings letters, wherein the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to depart the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> beginning with a Commemoration
(but without upbraiding) of their Tumults and insurrections,<note place="margin">With a speech that comes home to the men.</note> he told them,
<hi>That if they had of late years done any thing so licentiously, as to offend the King,
they might by their present obedience, not onely cancell the memory thereof, but
also highly merit at the Kings hand, from which they could not but exspect farre
more and firmer fortunes, then they should forgo in the</hi> Low-countreys. <hi>Could
gallant men find no other place but that to exercise their valour in? Kings, that
have large Dominions, never want causes of warre, nor rewards for souldiers.
But it was more then needed, to trouble themselves about other mens opinions
touching their departure: it being evident by whom and with what artifice this
was brought about. For such as feared them, could not indure their company;
and no marvell if their inferiours, that more then once found themselves over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched,
now feared them. Their neighbours saw and strangers heard, how often
the</hi> Spaniard <hi>had cowed the rebellious Enemy. They knew the number of Forts,
Towns, and victories wonne by the Armie: and that for ten years together in all
Land-battels (for at Sea there was a variation of Fortune) the</hi> Spaniards <hi>at all
times, excepting that one overthrow of Count</hi> Aremberg, <hi>remained Conquerours.
They likewise knew, that in the killing of such multitudes, no lesse then thirty
thousand, as the</hi> Low-countreymen <hi>themselves confesse, so few</hi> Spaniards <hi>have
been lost, that upon computation Ten</hi> Spaniards <hi>were able to rout a Thousand.
Truly a miserable slaughter, and to be buryed in silence, if it had not been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for Religion and the King, upon Rebells unto both. But with this very name
of Rebell, if, by a bloudy Edict of the Estates, the late</hi> Spanish <hi>Mutineirs were
branded; Don</hi> John <hi>hath abundantly provided against that Edict, by framing
a new one of his own, and making void the old: thereby favouring their Merits,
and obliging their Obedience: so as they may with greater honour obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
and their valour shewn upon the enemy will not appear more glorious
then their Loyaltie to their Sovereign; and not onely by taking Forts and Cities
with their Arms, but likewise by laying them down at his Majesties Command, with
equall praise in both, they will be said to have asserted the</hi> Low-countreys <hi>to the
King.</hi> This last part of his Speech moved the Souldiers wavering minds
(for rather the spirit of sedition then of anger vanished) and He reading
an honourable Edict,<note place="margin">They are quieted</note> on their behalf, posted up in many placed, They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
into the hands of the Estates the Forts of <hi>Antwerp,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">His winning wayes.</note> as

and was acknowledged Governour, but he yet more indeared himself to
that people, by his admired Clemencie, Affabilitie, Graciousnesse, and
Bountie, beyond example extended even unto his Enemies. Insomuch as
the Subjects enamoured of the sweetnesse of his deportment (above what
they could imagine, or had ever heard related) praised him to the skies;

And it was not long before it appeared, how he was over-reached in

putting off his hat and laughing; he said to the Duke, <hi>Do you see this bald

with empty forms of Courtship, as not to observe the Bird-call, that by sweetnesse of
sound brings the free creatures of the air into the net? They had now sufficient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
that new Men came out of</hi> Spain, <hi>not new Manners, for in that Shop they were
all cast in the same would. But above all the rest, they should beware of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
puft up with his Imperiall bloud, &amp; fortune in the wars, which if he now dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
stooping to the civility of a private person, the more it goes against the hair with
a haughty and tyrannicall nature, the sooner would his hypocrisie be laid by, and their
slavery inhaunsed. No proud man carried ever himself like a servant to any, over
whom he did not hope to be a master. Why hath he got a Guard, if he be so popular as
wholly to confide in the affection of the Subject? Can any one doubt whither all these
excessive bounties and promises tend, wherewith that princely Merchant loads men
of merit, and no merit? Yet some there are, who, notwithstanding they see this general
Munificence traffick for the liberty of the</hi> Low-countreys, <hi>think, that fre-men sell
themselves into bondage at a considerable rate. Wherefore let them look into the man,
&amp; they will find it impossible, that he should love the</hi> Low-countreys, <hi>who betrayed
to King</hi> Philip, <hi>the Patron of the</hi> Low-countrey <hi>Lords,</hi> Charles, <hi>Prince of</hi> Spain.

Which attempt, though it was consonant to the rest of <hi>Aldegunds</hi> life, a man
ignominiously wicked, who when he was a boy, was <hi>Calvins</hi> auditour; and

For having lost all hope of quieting these Provinces by indulgence,
and liberality, (an Honour forfeited by the former Governours of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi>
which he laboured to recover) when he found that his clemency
prevailed not, but the Magistrates authority waxed, his waned, and was
rather a kind of entreaty, then command: his life exposed to the daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and plots of wicked men; He not able to suffer their affronts, having
been accustomed to command great Armies; and finding his hands tied both
at home and abroad, weary of such a life, was glad to lay hold of that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and rather chose an open Warre, then a miserable and unsafe
Peace.</p>
               <p>Indeed it was an Argument of a mind highly offended and incensed,<note place="margin">The state of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs on both parts.</note> that

cause to be likewise honester, conceiving all <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austra's</hi> jealousies
and fears, to be onely pretences for the justice of a Warre. Therefore, by
Letters to the King, they accused him for endeavouring to ingage the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi>
upon vain suspicions. It seems, we must not beleive Treason to
be plotted against any Prince, that is not slain.<note place="margin">Don John's <hi>forces.</hi>
                  </note> Nor could he then raise an

                  <note place="margin">Gregory the xiii. his Legate.</note> the Popes Legate

give their assents. Howbeit, I wonder not so much at the Empresse-Dowager, who
I believe knew nothing at all of the Designe; but am rather grieved on her behalf,
and fear that her sonne's levity will much afflict her. What I should think of the

<hi>Giovanni Dominico,</hi> Cardinall de <hi>Cuppis,</hi> Prince of the sacred Senate, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized
them, the elder <hi>Alexander,</hi> the younger <hi>Charles;</hi> this by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
name, that by the name of <hi>Paul</hi> before he was elected Pope. But
<hi>Charles</hi> dying soon after, all their care was fixed upon the Education of
<hi>Alexander.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Education.</note> He spent the time of his infancy in the bosome and embraces
of his Mother, <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Austria;</hi> his child-hood under the best Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
that Age afforded, yet with little benefit, at least not answerable to
the industry of the Masters, and aptness of the Scholler: For he, of a
restless and fiery nature,<note place="margin">Prospensation to Armes.</note> hated the fetters of Study; and in the field a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
in riding the great horse, and practising his weapon, more delighted
to exercise his body, then his mind. That which cherished, or rather
made this impression in the Childs mind,<note place="margin">On what occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he came first to fancy, and by degrees to be deeply in love with the Warrs.</note> was the armes and warlike prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
in his Fathers house, which he fancied as his first fine object: by
which, much sooner then by the Starrs that raign at our nativities, mens
manners commonly are moulded. For his Father, hastning to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the <hi>Alps,</hi> with forces to the Emperour, all the house clattering
with Armour at his birth, so intertained the infant, that indeed he heard
the sound of the trumpet, before the singing of his nurse, and had the
drum for a Rattle: the first light that saluted his eye, being the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of Armes. Nay, the year following, the Trophies brought out
of <hi>Germany</hi> by his Father, set the child a longing. A little while after
emulous Armies fighting before <hi>Parma,</hi> where at six years old the boy was
besieged, and bred up in the noise and thunder of the cannon; with war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

war ingaging his Father; the younger he was, the deeper were military
figures stamped in his imagination,<note place="margin">He is sent, very young, into the <hi>Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys</hi> to King <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </note> and formed in him a martiall soul. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had past his childhood, he was by his Mother sent into the <hi>Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys</hi>
to Duke <hi>Octavio,</hi> that he might deliver him to King <hi>Philip,</hi> as a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of renuing his service to the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and likewise that by
such a Pledge as their onely son,<note place="margin">1557.</note> they might win the affection of his Uncle,
&amp; yet (which they most desired) the Castle of <hi>Piacenza</hi> restored, the City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already in their hands. And King <hi>Philip,</hi> whatsoever their intention was,
willingly received the child, delighted with the image of his beloved Sister;
but especially, because he took him as an Hostage of the <hi>Farnezes</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
He was a year and an half with the King in the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> much
pleased with the sight of military exercises. And, they say,<note place="margin">His strange suit to the King.</note> when the King
carried him to the Army at Saint <hi>Quintin,</hi> that very day the Town was
stormed and taken, he very passionately begged of his Majestie, that he
might be armed, and sent to the assault: but when he was put off, between
admiration and laughter, being but eleven years old, he cryed extreamly,
and they had much ado to stay him in the Camp.<note place="margin">King <hi>Philip</hi> carryes him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> Going from thence with
his Majestie into <hi>Spain,</hi> he lived there almost eight yeares, educated with
<hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria:</hi> some part of the time at
<hi>Alcala</hi> (to which University the Prince was sent) the rest in the Court at
<hi>Madrid;</hi> where he was in his Uncles eye, and pleased him so well, that he
esteemed and loved him as his own sonne.<note place="margin">His Majesties affection to him.</note> The Kings affection to him was
encreased, by comparing him with Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> whose loose and crabbed
manners differed much from his fathers gravity. Nor did this favour (which
is rare at Court) expose him to the hatred of the Grandees; being either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
it,<note place="margin">How much he was honoured by others, and why.</note> as Nephew to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, or obliging them with handsome
and noble Ceremonies, continuall good offices and bounties wherein he
exceeded, and thereby somewhat prejudiced his House. But in the use of
arms, especially in all presentments on horsback (often set forth by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
emulation of Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Don Iohn</hi>) his carriage was so prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and advised, though he sometime undauntedly opposed his unarmed
bodie against eminent danger, that being in those counterfeited fights ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
by the beholders, to see him was both their delight and fear.
In the twentieth year of his age,<note place="margin">His Marriage.</note> the King resolved to marry him to Princess
<hi>Mary,</hi> daughter to <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Portugall,</hi> neice to King <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> the
miracle of that time for rarenesse of wit, and sanctitie of life. And to do
honour to his Sister, then Governess of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> he sent thither her
sonne <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Bride following from <hi>Portugall</hi> in the Royal fleet.
His Father Duke <hi>Octavio</hi> came likewise in great State from <hi>Italy</hi> to the
Marriage, celebrated at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> with the above-mentioned gratulation
of the Provinces.<note place="margin">1565.</note> From hence he went to <hi>Parma,</hi> where after he had had
many children by his wife,<note place="margin">His issue.</note> three of which, <hi>Margaret</hi> Princesse of <hi>Mantua</hi>
(afterwards translated to happier Nuptialls with the celestiall Bridegroom)

of war, he at once <hi>fed</hi> and <hi>deceived</hi> his longing. Yet, being natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fierce, now and then he did things that would better have become a <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,</hi>

to pieces.<note place="margin">Tacit l. 13.</note> But Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> commonly alone, or but with one compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,<note place="margin">Annal.</note>
would bid nigh-walkers stand, and fight with them, to try both theirs

him so farre, that if he heard any one commended for a sword-man, he could
not rest till he had met him by dark,<note place="margin">Exposed to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</note> and compared his strength and skill at
his weapon with the other. They say that once meeting <hi>Comes Taurello,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and stout Gentleman in the night, instantly in that very place (where he
had often wished the incounter) he challenged and fought with him; but
<hi>Taurello,</hi> by a torch that accidentally passed by, perceiving his opposite to be
Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> throwing down his Arms craved pardon, if ignorant and
provoked, he had wronged his sword, by lifting it up against his Prince.
This being newsed about the Town, many afterwards shunned the occasion
of meeting with the Prince, lest they should, if worsted, loose their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
or the Princes favour, if they got the better.</p>

Divers considerations incited him to that voyage; the ground of the Warre,

out of this Gally of the Treasurers; besides what his two other Gallies
found in three of the enemies Galliouns, and as many of their Galliasses.
They say, that Don <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> after the Battel, when he heard his

joy and love,<note place="margin">Don <hi>John's</hi> words to <hi>Alex. Farneze.</hi>

and said, the reason of his confidence was built upon the sanctitie of his
wife, by whose prayers to God for him, he conceived himself protected
and secured; so merrily passing over his uncles reprehension. Nor was

off by land. Who with 6000 in two divisions began to batter the Fort,
with more industrie, then successe. For the place being all rock, or craggy,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41239:154"/>
his men could hardly get earth to raise their batteries, nor could their tubbs
and Gabions filled with earth and stone, opposed in stead of a curtain, be
defence sufficient against the enemies Cannon. The Seige was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

were thought to be upon the point of yielding:<note place="margin">but finding his endeavours frustrate, Retreats.</note> When the <hi>Turks,</hi> either by
the connivence or ignorance of Prince <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Souldiers, put in men by
night, and relieved the Garrison. Besides, the Turkish horse and foot coming
from al quarters, Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> fearing they would block up his retreat,
and not hoping to take the Castle, thought it enough in his enemies sight to
retire with his Cannon to the Fleet. And Don <hi>Iohn,</hi> since the <hi>Turkish</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
shunning a general Battell, could by no affront be provoked to sea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to have struct a terrour into the enemy, and forced them to confesse

Thus was <hi>Alexander Farneze</hi> initiated in war, which as it begat an

               </p>

his Sister <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> with her Son <hi>Alexander Farneze.</hi> Hoping
either by her prudence and power with the <hi>Low-countrey-men</hi> to find out
some expedient towards the concluding of a Peace; or by his valour, if
there was use of Arms, strongly to pursue the war. Therefore he ordered
it, that Cardinall <hi>Granvell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cardinal <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> treats with them both in the King's name.</note> then at <hi>Rome,</hi> should perswade his sister of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
to return into the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi> The Cardinall taking a journey to
<hi>Aquila,</hi> found there very opportunely the Dutchesse and Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi>
and read his letters containing the Kings desires to both together. Though
his Majesty had likewise commanded the Marquesse of <hi>Ayamont,</hi> Governour
of <hi>Millaine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Margaret <hi>of</hi> Parma <hi>is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the offer.</hi>
                  </note> to treat with Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> apart. The Dutchesse answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
doubtfully,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>So is not her son</hi> Alexander.</note> she would advise upon it; either fearing as she pretended, to
displease Don <hi>Iohn:</hi> or by that delay and seeming refusal aym to put a
higher value upon her journey. But <hi>Alexander Farneze,</hi> without the least
demurring, said he would obey the King with all his heart, if it so pleased
his mother. He made yet a plainer answer to two letters delivered him by
<hi>Raphael Manrique,</hi> from <hi>Ayamont,</hi> (that was sick and kept his bed;) together
with his Majesties letter,<note place="margin">9 &amp; 11 No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb. 1577. 11 Septemb. 1577.</note> wherein, after expression of his grief for the death

<hi>now you know it, with a ready and undaunted mind you will satisfie my exspectation

Dutchesse in his Brothers place, by reason of <hi>Matthias</hi> the Arch-dukes
coming into the <hi>Low-countreyes,</hi> it was doubted at <hi>Parma,</hi> whether it would
be handsome for Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> to go and fight in the <hi>Low-countreyes,</hi>
commanded by another: which consideration, he out of duty to the King,
and desire of glory in the wars, easily contemned; especially incouraged by
some dark words of <hi>Granvell,</hi> promising great matters. Besides <hi>Gregory</hi> the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41239:155"/>
thirteenth interposed his Authority and exhortation;<note place="margin">The Pope's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</note> who, informed of the
design by Cardinal <hi>Farneze,</hi> highly praised it, and bad the Cardinal write
to the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> in his name, <hi>that the expedition would be pleasing to God;
and therefore under so mighty protection, and upon encouragement from his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he should willingly and speedily undertake it.</hi> The Pope, I suppose, did not
thus commend the warre, onely for the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> sake, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Empire. For the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> being a Feudatary and
Homager to the See Apostolick, his Holinesse thought himself concerned,
in sending the Prince to a Forein warre, whence he might return an able

having within a few dayes, received three letters from Don <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi>
which invited him with great entreaties, and no lesse promises, to the society
of warre and glory; making ready with all possible speed, the twelvth day

It is therefore probable, that Don <hi>Iohn,</hi> not against his will, or onely by the

welcome him, from whose long approved fidelitie and valour he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
safety to the publick, and a particular preservation to himself, whose
life was sought by so many plots. At their first meeting, Don <hi>Iohn</hi> impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Kings commands,<note place="margin">The Pension given by the King to <hi>Alex. Farneze.</hi>
                  </note> that he should acquaint Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> with all

moneth. Both which conditions pleased him very much, especially the
later, usually given by the King to none but Viceroyes, Governours of
Provinces, or Generalls of Armies. For some dayes the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>
took the money, (till the Kings high estimation of his merit was thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged

that it was not fit he should be so remunerated, who had yet done no
service, and he needed no encouragement.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Alexander Farneze</hi> acting nothing without order from Don <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The state of the Provinces.</note>
wholly applyed his minde and endeavours to inform himself of affaires at

King had but two Provinces that continued loyall; in the rest, the few Forts
that held for his Majestie, daily revolted to the States. Nay even in <hi>Holland,

at last had got by their fear and flight, into the Town. It being further
said, that <hi>Gemblac</hi> was taken by the enemie, who had the Generall of their

in other places the Townsmen being no longer able to resist, and hearing the

Others,<note place="margin">They that flie are cut to pieces</note> almost an hundred and fiftie, stealing away in the night out at the

and consequently neither could the Castle be battered, nor they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

followed it with such eagerness, as that verie night, though wearied
with the day's fight, in four hours space they not onely levelled the
earth-work on this side the Port; but cast it up again within the Town,
planting upon it their battery against the Castle. But the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

leave to depart. Whether angry with their own unfortunate miscarriage in
the siege of <hi>Nivel,</hi> so as they could not brook the sight of their fellow-souldiers;
or whether losing their hopes of pillage (which drew them to it
before the Army came up) and therefore discontented that the Generall
had been so quick in giving them conditions, and had (onely that his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
might be famed) spared a Town deserving to be sack'd: or lastly,
whether (as I rather think) induced thereto by the States Emissaries, which
perswading them,<note place="margin">Duke of Alen-Son.</note> that the Kings brother, the Duke of <hi>Alengon</hi> would come
into the <hi>Low-countreys</hi> to oppose <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> won them to his service. I am

dismissed them, whom, though gallant souldiers, yet impatient of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

to avoid their ill opinions, sometimes gave more, lest he should be suspected
to give lesse,<note place="margin">They return in arms against him.</note> then they deserved. But almost six hundred of these men, that
a while after came back from <hi>France,</hi> to serve the enemie, had as evil for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
as advice. For surprizing some villages in the entrance of <hi>Haynolt,</hi>
whilst they feast, and think themselves secure, <hi>Camillo</hi> a <hi>Monte</hi> falling upon
their quarters, who for his speedier march brought three hundred Horse with
every one a Musketteer behind him, presenting death before battell, killed
above two hundred of them.<note place="margin">Part of them slain by surprise Part retire to a Fort.</note> The rest valiantly fighting, made good their

After a short parley,<note place="margin">And will take no conditions.</note> broke off with some hot language, <hi>Cenamio</hi> in a hostile
manner, though wounded and bleeding, sent him away, professing he would
sooner part with his life, then with the Castle. Whereupon <hi>Camillo,</hi> more
enraged, had now drawn out his men to the assault. But not daring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Cannon to adventure upon the Castle, new garrison'd by the <hi>French,</hi> he
marched back to the Army, that was at the same time, with strange celerity,
victorious over <hi>Haynolt.</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41239:160"/>
high walls, lined thick with earth to damp the Cannon-bullets, and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a marvellous broad ditch. <hi>Don Iohn</hi> considering all this, delivered
his opinion, that it was not to be assaulted with the Sword, but with the
Spade, the old and faithfull instrument for taking places fortified; all our
great souldiers (even at this day, when we are grown so much more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
then our Ancestours, in multiplying the engins of death) being not
able to invent a surer way to ruine walls; which are lesse endangered by the
thunder of the Cannon, then by this slow and silent weapon of the Pioner;
whence souldiers have a Proverb,<note place="margin">'Tis invaded</note> that <hi>'tis the spade and pickax, which build
and destroy Forts.</hi> Therefore after he had drawn a line about the town, and
brought his trenches near the ditch, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> commanded the Pioners,
working under long and thick <hi>boards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">As we read in Cesar, Livie, and others.</note> in the form of a Tortois, covered
with raw hides to secure them from Granadoes (anciently called Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
and Galleries) to enter the ditch, and with their Pickaxes and Spades
to undermine the foundation of the wall. Which whilst they (guarded
by the souldiers) strongly endeavoured, the defendants sallying out, and at
the same time others from the walls pouring down stones and wild-fire,
they had divers bloudy encounters,<note place="margin">Don <hi>John</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the parts of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and a common souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> with great losse on both sides. <hi>Don
Iohn</hi> in the mean time, omitting no duty either of a Generall, or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
so as at the works, he both called upon, and contended with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
souldier. At last, the hearts of the besieged no lesse shaken then their
walls, partly being divided among themselves, so that first they imprisoned
<hi>Florineus</hi> Governour of the Town for favouring the Royalists, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
released him; partly upon news of the defeat of those forces, which

beating, Colours flying, and the wonted pomp of souldiers, that carry out

was aspersed, as if they shunned the Enemy, and durst not come to a

to storme it. For <hi>Limburg</hi> stands upon a high Rock, the Valley about it
being all craggy,<note place="margin">The site of <hi>Limburg.</hi>
                  </note> and therefore, saue only by the higher ground towards

which and the Towne was the smoothest part of the Valley.
From the Hill he commanded the Pioners to run a Trench sloping

downe into the Valley, and from thence to carry it within sight of the
Towne, thence turning againe obliquely, to bring it to the Sconce at the
very City gate: whilst the rest of his Workmen on the other side under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
a Tower at some distance from the Castle, shooting out like a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory.
In both Works was more of Terrour then Danger to the
Towne. For they had scarce broke the Earth two foote deepe, when they
were hindred by Rock. Yet making blindes of Boughs they defended their

knowing that the Besieged used such trifling Delayes, only to gaine time,
forbade the Messengers to go any more: conceiving it below the Dignity
of the King's Army, and that it would show like a Confession of some
Weaknesse:<note place="margin">He hastens the finishing his workes.</note> but was more industrious in advancing towards the Towne
his Trenches on the one side, and his Mines upon the other: <hi>Comes Caesius</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41239:164"/>
to my custome I thus decline a Battaile. Which considerations, though I
am better at</hi> Action <hi>then</hi> Discourse, <hi>I shall in short explaine. We invade
an Enemy strong in number, safe in their ground, and conveniences for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
intrenched and pallisadoed by the adjoyning woods. If they, when we
come to face them, knowing themselves secure, and therefore slighting us,
shall keepe within their Trenches, by what Force, by what Art can we draw
them out into the Field? But if we only shew our Army, and having given
them a sight of us, retire, what shall we gaine by our troublesome March hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the leaving our Garrisons naked, and consequently exposed to
the danger of the</hi> French: <hi>Yet their backwardnesse to fight will make them
appear the weaker, why rather should not our frustrated indeavours and
our Retreate shew them to be invincible? Besides, never without losse di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any
Army fall off, and give the Word for a Retreate, though never so skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and Souldierly. But suppose the Enemy, as we wish, draw out, and
give us Battaile of their owne accord. Or say our valour force their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
shall we presently promise our selves the Victory? Truly a wise Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
is concerned not only to consider his owne, but likewise the Enemies
strength and Inclination, and industriously in his heart to cast up a just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what benefit will result to himselfe, what to the enemy by the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
or improsperous chance of Warre. Indeed my opinion is, that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and theirs at the present differs very much. In the Royall Army, here
in the Field with us, all our strength consists; that being defeated (which</hi>
Omen <hi>God turne upon the Enemy) where shall we raise men to defend our
Remainder of the</hi> Low-countreys <hi>against the Conquerour? But they will
not be so much indangered by the losse of a Battaile. For if that Army we
march against be routed, they can recruit, assisted on the one part by Duke</hi>
Alencon <hi>and his</hi> French-men, <hi>on the other by Prince</hi> Casimir, <hi>and the
still increasing</hi> German <hi>Succours. But in case (which is to be hoped from
God's goodnesse and our Souldiers Courage) the Catholique Army shall with
a better Cause likewise have the better Fortune; with how much bloud, with
what exchange of Gold for Drosse must we buy the victory, fighting before
their Campe, with their fresh and intire Forces? But when we have thus
weakned our selves by conquering, if the</hi> French, <hi>that watch all occasions,
fall upon us; how I feare our Conquest will be followed with a farre greater
misfortune; we indeed shall have the Honour of the Day, but others reape
the profit. In summe, we may be victorious in the Battaile, and vanquished
in the Warre. Wherefore since in this our voluntary expedition, we may
in reason feare almost the same Disaster, whether</hi> conquered <hi>or</hi> conquering,
<hi>my opinion is, that we should give off the attempt, and at present check this

the confederates Campe, before they should be reinforced with new sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.
Count <hi>Mansfeldt</hi> the Campe-master held it a point of Honour for
the Royall Army to rouse the enemy within covert, that trusted more to
the place, then either to their Armes or Valour. The Generall of the
Horse, <hi>Octavio,</hi> said, the Souldiers Alacrity must be used before Delay
had dulled it, and that they were to follow the happy presage of victory
expressed in their unanimous consent to fight: and a successe was to be
hoped, especially at this time, by reason of the enemi's Discord. For <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick

by way of Stratagem to deceive the Royall Army with vaine hopes of

making a Halt (for <hi>Norreys</hi> now supplyed from the Neighbouring Campe,

the armed men. Yet many of them were no lesse safe then others that
wore Armes which made them unweldier, not so nimble to avoid a hurt,
slower to rise when they were down, last in a Retreate, and often either
slaine by the Enemy, trod under their horses feete, or taken Prisoners.

cruelly shattered the Kings men, from which destruction not able

him, since they could not retire without being pursued and ruined, nor

rather would partake their danger,<note place="margin">And resolves to have the place conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> then come to their reliefe; yet that such
men ought not to be deserted with so great a losse both of Souldiers and

Orchards, lay a Passe, by which he despaired not to bring off the
Foote. He advised about it with Don <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Gonzaga;</hi> not denying,
but it was a dubious and almost a rash Attempt: yet he said, that in acute

the rest easily giving way that he should fetch them off; which he did
in this manner. At the Avenues of the hedges, planting Muskettiers, he
ordered them with a suddaine haile of Shott to stop the Advance of the
Enemy; and commanded <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> that rallying and animating the Horse,
he should bring them to guard the Rere whilst they retreated, and when
the Foote were safe among the hedges, give the Enemy a hot Charge,
and by the way they first entred, betwene the Village and the Wood,
narrow indeed, but faire and commodious for horse, retire to his Poste.

<hi>Leva's</hi> men gave back so happily, that, at first, they were too quick for

(and they were but a very few, most of them Foote) being now

either by feare of Death, or of captivity: till at length they themselves,
when all the Horse were safe, left the Field last: and like excellent Actors
in the Tragedy of <hi>Mars,</hi> came off with infinite Applause. So Generall
<hi>Bolduc</hi> sounding a Retreate, for feare his men might fall into a Counter-Ambuscado,
the Battaile ended; begun with farre greater preparation,
then it was followed by either side,<note place="margin">What losse on both sides.</note> with Execution. For in all not above

indeed by a Son to</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth, but with a lesse number of men) both
against the</hi> French <hi>Nation and two other powerfull Armies? His opinion
was therefore, that the Commissioners should be put in hope of peace, till
the King's pleasure was knowne, as to those proposalls, which if he accepted,
no doubt but in his wisdome he would provide another place worthy of his
Brother: but if looking upon their basenesse he rejected them, then, in case

                     <hi>Sir, Whereas in your Wisdome your Excellence
thought fitt to admonish me, as if I were gone too farre in accepting of that
Government, which by my endeavours should rather have beene transfer'd
upon the Royall Senate of the</hi> Low-countreys; <hi>it is no more, then I my
selfe imagined, as when I wrote of Don</hi> Iohn <hi>of</hi> Austria's <hi>Sicknesse, I sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed
to your Excellence. But when I called to minde, that after the death
of the greate Comendador, the</hi> Lowcountreys <hi>were undone by that very
Trust of the Royall Power is the Senates hands, which Ruine in all mens
opinions had never hapned to the Provinces, if his Successour had beene
forthwith nominated. And when I plainly saw the Losse of this Catholique
Army, without a Generall, to be inevitable, by reason of the feuds among the
Lords, and their discordant mindes, some drawing one way, some another,
and daily more slack in asserting the Kings Right: and, which is yet more
considerable, one or two of the greatest in his Army not obscurely wavering
in their Fidelity to the King, which would perhaps, if things among us
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41239:168"/>
were troubled, go over to the States: I, for these Reasons, first making my
Prayers to God, resolved, as to the point of my owne Honour, to run the
greatest hazard (which I saw impending) if either the King unmindfull
of me should bestow the Place upon another, or that the Warre succeeding
unfortunately should be censured by the Event: rather then to refuse the
burthen layed upon me, and for my owne Security and Iealously, to quit that
Remainder of the</hi> Low-countreys <hi>which none sufficiently defending must
needs have come into the Enemyes Power. Nor do I so much as doubt, but
God, that only knowes I have therefore adventured vpon his doubtfull
Chance, to show my selfe actively faithfull to my King (now when he wants
my Service, and that for his sake I contemne all dangers) will in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
mercy so regulate my affairs, that in the</hi> interim <hi>I shall doe nothing
unworthy your Excellence's prudent Care, or my owne infinite affection to
my Prince.</hi>

performed all the parts of a Generall, gave the King also an

with so much paines and exactnesse, as if the sick man were not (so Prince

Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> saving his haire and Complexion, in all the other parts of
his body was deformed: for one shoulder was higher, and one legg longer
then the other, nor was he lesse deformed in his furious and hauty mind.
Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> was indeed of a passionate and military Inclination, but
full of Courtship, whereto his sweete and pleasant Countenance seemed
to be naturally composed. But Don <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> as well in the habit of

And King <hi>Philip</hi> was somewhat distasted at Don <hi>Iohn's</hi> Aversion from
holy Orders, to which he had beene pressed, upon his Fathers Designation,
but too late. His Majestyes Displeasure was increased by his suddaine

likewise furnished it with Munition, put in a Garrison, and made <hi>Gabriel
Serbellonio</hi> Governour, as if he had resolved in that Towne to fix himselfe
a Royall Seate. As the King then especially believed, when in that very
point of time he saw the Pope's Legate in the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13
move him to honour Don <hi>Iohn</hi> for his Victoryes in <hi>Africa,</hi> with the Title

he placed new Servants about him, and made <hi>Iuan Escovedo</hi> his Secretary,
that is, he changed the names, but not the Natures, of his Brother's Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.
The King likewise observed, that his Brother grew to a greater
Animosity. Because, when he was called out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to go
from thence to the Government of the <hi>Low-countreys</hi> then designed him,<note place="margin">Who expects to take place at an <hi>Infanta.</hi>
                  </note>
he would not so much as come to Court: but went to the house of <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio
Perez</hi> to linger there, till he found whether the King would allow him
place,<note place="margin">The Kings goes out of towne purposely to decline the Grant.</note> as a Prince-Infanta within the Cloth of State. But the King that
went out of Towne lest he might discontent his young Brother with the
Assignation of his Place, stayed on purpose in the Countrey; receiving
him more affectionately, then magnificently, at <hi>Villa Pardo.</hi> And from
thence, exaggerating, indeed not falsely, the Necessity of the Provinces,
sent him presently into the <hi>Low-countreys.</hi> His Majestie's Suspicion also
appeares by the Instructions he gave Don <hi>Iohn,</hi> at his Departure. The first
and last whereof was,<note place="margin">And would have him go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the <hi>Lowcountries</hi> without an Army.</note> that he should quiet the Provinces upon any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
whatsoever, but a Warre: so as he did it with a Salvo to Religion

of that Warre, wished this might be the only Meanes of settling the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>
Tumults:<note place="margin">Not assured of his temper.</note> yet howsoever, I belieue his Majesty, who thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

irrevocable. For the same reason, when there was Necessity of a Warre,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41239:170"/>
Money to pay the Army came very sparingly from <hi>Spaine.</hi> For this very

there buryed, Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> laid his Vncles body in a temporary

For at his Death Don <hi>Iohn</hi> desired three things might in his name be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

pay them.<note place="margin">1570.</note> He made no Mention at all (which is wonderfull) of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
For Don <hi>Iohn</hi> had two Daughters, <hi>Anne</hi> and <hi>Ioane,</hi> this at <hi>Naples,</hi> by
<hi>Diana Phalanga a Surrentine</hi> Lady; that at <hi>Madrid,</hi> by <hi>Maria, Mendona</hi> a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41239:171"/>
Maide of an illustrious Family, and Beauty. <hi>Anne</hi> was privately bred by
<hi>Magdalena Vlloa,</hi> Don <hi>Iohn's</hi> owne Foster-Mother: and went from thence,
after she was seven years old,<note place="margin">Anne.</note> to a Nunnery of holy Virgins at <hi>Madrigall.
Ioane,</hi> for allmost as long a time, was educated by the Dutchesse of <hi>Parma,</hi>
Sister to Don <hi>Iohn;</hi> after whose death, she sent her to be bred up in a
Monastery of the Order of Saint <hi>Clare,</hi> at <hi>Naples;</hi> But She by Command
from the King was translated from <hi>Madrigall</hi> to <hi>Burgo's</hi> a House of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictin</hi>
Nunnes,<note place="margin">Ioane.</note> whose perpetuall Abbesse she was chosen. This, after she
had lived twentie yeares in the Cloister at <hi>Naples,</hi> was at last married into
<hi>Sicilie</hi> to Prince <hi>Butero.</hi> Both these Ladyes in one yeare, in one Month,<note place="margin">Feb. 1630.</note> only
not upon one day, deceased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I believe Don <hi>Iohn</hi> among those Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
which at his death he commended to the King,<note place="margin">Why he named them not, upon his death bed.</note> said nothing of his
Daughters, because he thought the King knew not of them: for they
were so privately and cautiously brought up, that <hi>Alexander Farneze</hi> (to
whom he imparted all his other Secrets) knew not of <hi>one</hi> of these. The
other had long since beene discovered to him, not by Don <hi>Iohn,</hi> but by his
owne Mother <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Austria:</hi> which was the Cause that, when Don
<hi>Iohn</hi> lay upon death-bed,<note place="margin">Alex. Farneze to his Mother Marg. of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. <hi>Octob.</hi> 6.</note> Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> durst not desire him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
that Daughter to the King, lest he might put him to the Blush, or
seeme willing by such Commendations to free his Mother of a Trouble.
But now <hi>Alexander Farneze</hi> acquainted his Majesty with those three last
Requests made by Don <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alex. Farneze</hi> writes to the King about Don <hi>Iohns.</hi> Petitions.</note> and earnestly sollicited the King's Grant. Of
himselfe and of the Governement intrusted to him he wrote little, rather
like one declining, then ambitious of the Honour. Only he exaggerated the
danger of the Catholique Army,<note place="margin">Octob. 1. and somewhat concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</note> the <hi>French</hi> being entred into <hi>Haynolt,</hi> and
the States Army ready to besiege their Campe: so that in this desperate
Condition of Affaires, only his Fidelity to the King compelled him rather
undauntedly, then ambitiously to receive that burthen.<note place="margin">But very much touching the danger of the present State of Affaires.</note> Although, as I
conjecture, not so much the present Danger, which was indeed very
great, as his doubtfullnesse of the King's mind held <hi>Alexander Farneze</hi> in
suspence. For he feared lest his Majesty, laying aside the care of Armes,
should call back his Mother into the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is not sure the King will confirme to him the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement.</note> where she was popular,
and therefore fit to conclude a Peace, or that, upon certaine Conditions

(as <hi>David</hi> Secretary to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> wrote from <hi>Spaine</hi> in Cypher to

Considerations to the King, for breaking off that Designation. I believe,

his study and falling into some Deboshes, he was by Don <hi>Iohn's</hi> Command committed

that since he was not made for a Scholler, neither his Fancy nor Abilityes agreeing
with that course of Life, he would please to set him at Liberty, and make a Souldier

certified the King, that he thought no lesse, therefore beseeched his pleasure might
be signifyed, where the Youth should be imployed in his Majestyes Service. It pleased
the King that he should learne his first Elements of Warr under <hi>Alexander Farneze,</hi>
assigning to the young Souldier 50 Ducats a Month. Lastly, the King consented to
