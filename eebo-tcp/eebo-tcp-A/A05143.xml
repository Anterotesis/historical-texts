            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as the Godly by theyr earnest and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all praying and praysing of the name of God, doo declare their reuerend feare they beare towardes his diuine maiestye, and theyr vnfayned loue the whiche is grafted in their harts by the gratious and diuine spirit, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes their heauenly and most louing father, by the whiche they ar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coraged willingly and chearfully to walke in the waye of Godlynes, and to frame their lyues to the will and pleasure of him whom they feare and loue: So on the contrarye syde, the vngodly, in that they doo not call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their God, neither prayse him, most euidently declare that they stand not in awe of him, nor loue him, but rather despise him as one that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to hurte or pleasure them.</p>

Let parentes and tutors do their dueties to bryng theym vp so, that as soone as theyr age serueth, they may tast and sauour god: let them feare god in the beginning, and so they shall do also whan they be olde.

A man may be an enemy of the crosse of Christe two manner of wayes. All the papistes in Englande and speciallye the spirituall men, be the enemyes of the crosse of Christe two maner of wayes. Fyrste when he is a ryghte papiste geuen to monkerye, I warraunt you he is in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that wyth hys owne workes he doth merite remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hys synnes, and satisfieth the law thorough and by his owne workes, and so thinketh himselfe to bee saued euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stynglye.

But thys texte maketh no more agaynste phisike, then thys texte doth agaynst labour, where Peter saith: Per totam noctem laborauimus, &amp; nihil coepimus, we haue laboured the whole night, and haue gotten nothyng. Now a rashe felow wil say what: hath S. Peter laboured al nyght, and cought nothing? then I wyll not labour at all: For I shall get nothyng with my labour: but this is a folishe reasonyng. For thoughe the woman spent all vpon phisitions, and yet was not healed: And though Peter laboured all nyght, and catched nothing, yet for all that we are allowed to vse phisike, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to labour.

No, we must labour, for so are we commaunded to doe, but we must looke for the increase at gods handes: lyke as Peter dyd, he laboured the whole nyght, yet he toke nothyng at all tyll Christ came. And yet this is not a certaine rule, he that much laboreth shall haue much. For though a man labour muche, yet for all that he shall haue no more then god hathe appoynted hym to haue: for euen as it pleaseth GOD, so he shall haue, Nam domini est terra &amp; plenitudo eius, For the<note place="margin">Psalm. xiiii</note> earthe is the Lordes, and all that is therein: and when we<note place="margin">He that hath much must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt for much.</note> haue muche, then we are accountable.

But what dothe God? when he saw that no man would withstand them, to verify his word, he sendeth a wynde, a strong hurlyng wynd, whiche blue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<note place="margin">God can blovv wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vvill.</note> all their prouisions, whiche was made for the buildyng of the temple, all the sande and morter and such lyke things, whiche men vse in suche buildinges: and after that, there came such an earthquake, that they were almost out of their wittes. And this was not inough, but there came also fyre &amp; burned by all their workes: and so finally they wer scattered agayne one from another. So by these stories, it manifestlye appeareth, that no mans power is able to stand against god, or to disapoint him of his purposes: for Christe our Sauiour had tolde them, that they shoulde neuer come to their rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn.

is: yet for all that, they shall rather perish, then that the word of god should be falsified. And this appeared in the Jewes, which though they had the aid &amp; help of this great emperor, &amp; the mighty power of this world: yet for al that they brought nothing to passe at all, for god was able to confounde them: and so no doute he will confound all his enemies, tyll thend<note place="margin">God is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:8770:158"/>
What is to be looked for? Surely, if al this that I saye, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a good Minister, it is much lyghter to require them all in euery one, then to finde one any where, that hath them al. Who is a true and a faithfull Stewarde?

For euer since the Prelates wer made Lordes &amp; Nobles, the plough standeth, there is no worke done, the people sterue.

And by the lording and loytring, preaching and ploughing is cleane gon. And thus if the ploughmen of the country, were as negligent in theyr office, as prelates be, we should not long lyue for lacks of sustenaunce. And as it is necessary for to haue this ploughyng for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>IN this first Sermon is declared, &amp; taught the godly election of a king, and a rule of godly liuing as touching his owne person. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The forme of his godlye rule also he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided here in this Sermon in three partes.

And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time shall require, to lead a pure lyfe, vnder the yoke of matrimony, admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing both his grace, and al other Maiestrates to be circumspect in chosyng a wyfe, eyther for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues or for their children, hauing this alwaies in mind, that she be, of a faithful house, godly brought vp, and of a pure lyfe? Thirdly he admonished the kinges grace, that he should not desyre gold &amp; syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to muche, prouing by many argumentes that that kinde of vice with the other forsaid, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction not only vnto the kinges grace: but also vnto the whole realme &amp; people, In these thinges consisteth the whole sum of this sermon.</p>

For the Bishop was as able and readye to buccle with the Lorde Protectoure, as he was with hym.</p>
                     <p>Was not this a good prelate? he should haue ben at home a preaching in hys Dioces in a waniant.

Therfore Christe came to deliuer vs from that, and gaue his body to be torn vpon the crosse for that. Neither could any work or lawe, or sacrifice redeme vs from that, but Christ onlye. I neuer preached in Lincolne shire afore, nor came here a fore, saue once when I went to take orders at Lincoln, which was a good while a go, therfore I can not say much of Lyncolne shire, for I know it not, but I dare saye, if Lincoln shire be<note place="margin">Lincoln shire.</note> as other places that I know, this text condemneth a great many of Lincolne shyre, and driueth them down to hel for breakinge of this commaundement: Geue to Ceasar that whiche is due to Ceaser, and to God that whiche is due to god. The office of a magistrate is grounded vpon Goddes word, and is plainly described of S. Paule, wrytinge vnto the Romaines, where he sheweth that all soules, that is to say, all men ought to obey the magistrates, for they are or dained of God, and to resist them, is to resist agaynst God. For he is Gods minister ordained to punishe the wycked and to maintaine the good. Wherfore we ought to pay to him tribute, custome, Taxes and other thinges that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth vpon vs, as Christ sayeth here, <hi>Reddite</hi> geue to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar. How much we shuld geue, he defineth not, but leaueth it to Ceasars offycers to determine, and to his counsell to appoynt. Christ was not the Emperoures treasurer, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Christe was not Lord trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer.</note> he medled not wyth that poynt, but left it the treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to define and determine. He went about another voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to preache vnto the people their duetye, and to obey theyr Princes, Kinges, Emperoures and magistrates, and to bid them geue that the kynge requireth of them, not to appoynt a kyng what he shal require of them. It is meete for euery man to kepe hys owne vocation, and diligentlye walke in it, and with faithfulnesse to study to be occupyed in that God hathe called him vnto, and not to be busye in that God hathe not called hym vnto. Therefore sayeth Christe: geue to Ceasar, but he appoynteth not howe muche, for that shoulde his treasurer knowe, and shoulde

I haue forgotten my logyke, but yet I can iumble at a Silogisme, and make an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of it to proue it by. Couetousnes is the roote of al euyl: Rebellion is an euil, Ergo Couetousnes is the roots of rebellion. And so it was in dede. Couetousnes was the cause<note place="margin">The cause of rebellion</note> of rebellion this last Sommer, and both parties had couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as well the Gentlemen as the Commous.

Nowe on the other side the Gentlemen had a desire to keepe that they had, and so they rebelled to agaynste the kynges commaundement, and agaynst suche good order as he and hys counsel woulde haue set in the realme. And thus both parties had couetousnes, and both parties dyd rebell. I hearde saye that there was godlye ordinaunces deuised for the redresse of it. But the Giauntes<note place="margin">The frou ning of a Giaunt.</note> would none of it in no sauce.

And when the tounsemen should bryng in what had beene inclosed, he frouned and chafed and so nere looked and threatened the poore men, tha they durst not aske theyr ryght. I red of late in an Act of Parliment: and thys Act made mencion of an act that was made in kyng Henries dayes (the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
