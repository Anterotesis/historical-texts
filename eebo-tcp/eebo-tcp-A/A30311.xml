            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TWO PROPOSALS, Humbly Offer'd to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, Now Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT. <list>
                  <item>I. That a Duty be laid on Malt, in the ſtead of the preſent Duty on Beer and Ale; and likewiſe, that the ſeveral Engagements that Revenue lies under, be Transferr'd on that of Malt.</item>

               </list> 
               <hi>To which is Annex'd</hi> An Accompt, what in all Probability the Frauds of Brewers do amount to, and wherein ſuch Frauds are Prejudicial to the King, to the Subject, and to the Trade it ſelf: Likewiſe by what Means ſuch Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances are moſt properly Redreſs'd.</p>

            <pb n="1" facs="tcp:47919:2"/>
            <head>A PROPOSAL humbly Offer'd to lay a Duty upon <hi>Malt,</hi> inſtead of the preſent Duty on <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Ale;</hi> and likewiſe, That the ſeveral Engagements the preſent Revenue lies under, be transferr'd on that of <hi>Malt.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is propos'd, That 8 <hi>s. per</hi> Quarter be laid on all Malt made, and to be made, to be paid by the Maker thereof monthly, and the Duty to be received by the Maltſters from their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers, before they deliver their <hi>Malt,</hi> ſo that the Credit they give may be the ſame, and not other than now it is: Beſides, that Brewer or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailer that cannot pay the Duty down, is not a fit Perſon to be truſted with the other; and thereby in ſome meaſure the Maltſter will be the better able to judge who is, or who is not fit to be truſted with his Commodity.</p>
            <p>It is humbly preſumed, That there can be no Tax levied that will be more Eaſie and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47919:3"/>
to his Majeſty's Subjects, that carries with it ſuch a viſible Advantage to His Majeſty, as this does; as is hoped will appear by the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such a Tax will be leſs felt than uſually Taxes are, by reaſon every Perſon will pay Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable in the Price of <hi>Malt.</hi> The more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal any Tax is, it is to be ſuppoſed (unleſs in ſome Particular Caſes) to be the more equal; and I preſume, no Perſon will deny that ſuch a Tax will prove ſo univerſal, that not any Perſon will Eſcape paying his Proportion according to his Conſumption; <hi>Ergo,</hi> No Perſon can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; who Conſumes little, will have but little to pay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> No Tax has yet been levied that can ſo ſpeedily, and with ſo little difficulty, be Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, as that on <hi>Malt;</hi> by reaſon the Maltſters are few in number.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is to be hoped there will not be ſuch Arrears as uſually are of Taxes, by reaſon the Maltſters are moſt, if not all of them, very rich Men, beſides (as is ſaid before) few in number.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47919:3"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The preſent Stock of <hi>Malt</hi> that lies in the Maltſters and Brewers Hands, will amount to a large and preſent Sum of Money; I hope I need ſay nothing to evince the Truth of this Aſfertion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Thoſe People that buy their Drink from the Common Brewer, will have their Drink Cheaper than now they have, by reaſon the 8 <hi>s.</hi> Propoſed to be levied, does not amount to ſo much as the Exciſe of a Quarter of <hi>Malt</hi> does by 5 <hi>s.</hi> when put into Drink; for every Brewer makes at leaſt Two Barrels and Three Fourths of Ale or Strong Beer of each Quarter of <hi>Malt,</hi> when <hi>Malt</hi> is at a moderate Price, and ſo more according as it riſes in Price; and Two Barrels and Three Fourths, according to the preſent Duty, will appear to be 13 <hi>s.</hi> or thereabouts. By this it does appear, the Brewer will get 5 <hi>s. per</hi> each Quarter of <hi>Malt</hi> more than now he does under the preſent Duty; and by the ſame Rule thoſe Perſons that buy of the Common Brewer will have their Drink cheaper than now they have: And likewiſe I may add this further, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Conſidering Houſewives will tell
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47919:4"/>
you, That according to the preſent Duty on Ale and Beer, there is very little, if any at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween buying their Drink of the Brewers, and making it themſelves; whether it be that the Quantity they brew is not great, ſo that they waſte as much Coals as if the Quantity were as much more, Servants time the ſame, or the want of Skill in making the moſt of their Malt, or the want of Judgment in chuſing what is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for their purpoſe, I will not pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine. But I have ſome Reaſon to believe all what I have named have in their ſeveral Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances an equal ſhare; however, I leave this Matter to thoſe who have made more Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than I have; but, if this Poſition be true, then I may venture to fay, There will very few or none feel this Tax, but, inſtead thereof, may prove both a Conveniency and an Advantage to almoſt all Perſons; however it may be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Encouragement that ſuch a Tax be Levied, ſince likewiſe it is to be feared there will be a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Levying of ſome ſort of Tax or other; therefore may preſume this will not be left deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Hope of Succeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47919:4"/>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It will put a mighty Equality on the Brewing Trade, even to the Preſervation of a great Number of Brewers, that are at this time almoſt at the Brink of Ruine, and have Strugled under the Diſeaſe for ſeveral Years laſt paſt, by reaſon of the Great Brewers, who by their great Trades having a mighty Opportunity of Defrauding more than the Leſſer Ones have, to keep up and advance their Trades, do ſell better or ſtronger Drink, more Meaſure and Cheaper than the Leſſer Brewers (who, by reaſon of the Smalneſs of their Trades, have not ſuch Advantage by Frauds) can afford to do: And by this means it does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they cannot have any Cuſtomers that can be ſuppoſed to make good Payment for what they buy of them; for if they could, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they would apply themſelves to the Great Brewers, where they will receive ſuch viſible Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, different from what the Leſſer Brewers can afford to let them have, and conſequently thoſe few good Cuſtomers the Leſſer Brewers have, they get nothing by, perhaps loſe; ſince then, the only Cuſtomers the Leſſer Brewers have, that they can hope to get by, are bad, it may be concluded, Such an Employment muſt end in Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47919:5"/>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Every 100 <hi>l.</hi> ſo Collected, is better by 3 <hi>l.</hi> or 4 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> (according to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt His Majeſty pays for Money) than any Tax that has yet appear'd, by reaſon Malt cannot be made in the Summer; ſo that the Maltſters are forced to make the Quantity of the whole Year in the Winter Seaſon, and conſequently the whole Tax will be received in leſs than Seven Months.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> The Charge of bringing this Tax in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Exchequer, will not be above One Third Part ſo much as that of the Exciſe on Ale and Beer now is. Every Perſon that knows a Malt-houſe, and a Brewhouſe, knows the Tediouſneſs of the Firſt, and the Nimbleneſs of the Latter; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that One Officer may ſerve one Malt-Kiln (by the way, it is reaſonable to believe there are Twenty Brewhouſes to One Kiln) better Three Officers can One Brewhouſe, according to the preſent Laws and Management of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: Beſides, the Propoſer humbly preſumes he hath Framed ſuch a Method, that it ſhall be morally impoſſible, That the Maker of Malt can defraud the Tax or any part thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47919:5"/>
How much this will advance beyond what now it does, I will not pretend to ſay; becauſe I think no Juſt or Certain Eſtimation can be made thereof; but when once we reflect on the great Quantities of Stout or Double-Ales, and Stout or Double-Beer, that the ſeveral and almoſt all the Counties in <hi>England,</hi> nay, that paſs by the Names of each County or Town, that is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in this Town, not to mention what every Town or County Conſumes it ſelf of thoſe ſorts of Liquors, even <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex</hi> not exempted, which Pay, as it is laid on the Drink, no more Duty than the Common Ale and Strong Beer the Common Brewers brew, which conſumes five times the Malt in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to every Barrel of thoſe ſorts of Liquors that the Common Ale and Beer does; and perhaps 'tis not very difficult to prove, were it Neceſſary, that it was the Chiefeſt Cauſe (the Humour of this Town, as well as the Country, running more of late upon theſe very Strong Liquors than heretofore) that the Exciſe on Ale and Beer, when Doubled, did not amount to twice the Value of the Exciſe, when Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, together with the difficulty of Detecting the Frauds of Brewers, which they were encourag'd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47919:6"/>
to, ſo much the more, by ſo much the greater the Duty was; Nay, the Commiſſioners of Exciſe can, if they pleaſe, tell you, it did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to much more than One Third Part more than when Single; but when likewiſe we come to reflect what great Quantities neceſſarily muſt be uſed by all the Private Families that Brew their own Drink, together with the Yearly large Quantities that are Exported beyond the Seas, I ſay, when we once come to reflect on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways that neceſſarily muſt be, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of that ſort of Grain, together with theſe Viſible Advantages, that this will be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with leſs than One Third Part of the Charge that the other is; the Prevention of the Brewer's Frauds, and the Money all brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Exchequer</hi> in Seven Months; when I come and tell you likewiſe, that the Frauds of Brewer's, together with the many bad Debts the Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Kettle Brewers do make, and unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble too, will, in all probability, amount, with the two Thirds ſaved in the difference of Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to at leaſt 220000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> which bad Debts cannot be ſuppoſed to be Contracted with the Maltſters, who, (as is hinted before,) are all rich Men, which I hope I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47919:6"/>
proved in my Propoſals, now before the Right Honourable the Lords Commiſſioners of His Majeſty's Treaſury, Intituled, <hi>Propoſals for the better Management of the Brewery;</hi> there needs nothing more, in my Humble Opinion, to induce a Compliance with ſuch a Propoſal; However, to give it yet a greater Credit, let us but look what Effects the Coffee-Berry has had; which will appear Viſible to any Capacity, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the one with the other) to be a very Parallel Caſe; Nay, even in this; that the Coffee-houſes contracted a great many bad Debts that are not yet, and 'tis to be feared never will be paid, now upon the Berry quite the contrary: I think no Perſon a Stranger to the Effects of that Act, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially not any of the Honourable Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to whom this is chiefly Intended, becauſe there ſcarce ever yet was any thing of this kind that had not its Enemies, though it were but for Argument ſake over a Diſh of Coffee in a Coffee-Houſe; therefore I cannot hope this ſhould eſcape, were it much better than what it is, I take the Liberty of laying down what I humbly Conceive are the moſt Material or Probable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that can be made to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:47919:7"/>
The Enemies of this Propoſal will be apt to make theſe three following Objections, which, according to my Apprehenſion, are all the thing can be ſuppoſed to bear.</p>
            <div n="1" type="objection">
               <head>

               <p>It is not ſo Equal as the Propoſer would have the World believe, by reaſon the Tax will fall intirely upon one ſort of Grain, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently upon one ſort of Land that bears ſuch Grain.</p>
               <p>To which I make Anſwer; The Difference of affecting the Land or Grain more by this Duty, than it is affected, by that of the Exciſe on Beer and Ale, is only, it pays the Duty in one when Malt, in the other, when that very Mault is made into Drink; and Malt is of little or no other uſe, or at leaſt 'tis not put to any other than the making of Drink in this Nation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is this general Argument to back it, that the Seller always Commands the Buyer; Conſequently, the <hi>Farmer</hi> and <hi>Maltſter</hi> will get more than now they do, and this Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to other People as well as the Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of having their Drink Cheaper than now
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47919:7"/>
they have, as I hope I have already before made it plainly appear, and the Brewer to have the Viſible Encouragement of 5 <hi>s. per</hi> Quarter, I ſay both theſe muſt neceſſarily cauſe the Greater Conſumption of that ſort of Grain. It is to be hoped from theſe Conſiderations, that Malt will be one of the Chiefeſt and moſt Advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Grain the <hi>Farmers</hi> will imploy themſelves in; Conſequently, that ſort of Land will bear to the Landlord a greater Price.</p>

               <p>That Private Families, and thoſe Strangers that carry this ſort of Grain beyond the Seas, will be Subject to a Duty in this, that were not by that of the Exciſe on Beer and Ale.</p>
               <p>To which I make this Anſwer; I hope I have made it appear, that Private Families will rather be Gainers; Eſpecially, all thoſe that buy their Drink from the Common Brewer, and thoſe that do not, the Difference ſo little, I believe will (according to what I have hinted of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before) be ſcare diſcernable; unleſs it be to ſome few that cannot have the Conveniency of

               <p>How the Preſent Engagements on the Revenue of Exciſe on Beer and Ale, can be transferred on Malt to the Satisfaction of the King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; Which in truth is rather a Queſtion, and the Lawyers are the fitteſt Perſons to reconcile that.</p>
               <p>However! I beg leave humbly to offer ſomething on the King's Behalf, that his Subjects ſecurity on this of Malt, will be much Greater and the Duty much Quicker brought into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> though they will not have the ſame Security for their Money, as they had when they Lent their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; Yet if they have inſtead thereof a much Greater, and a Quicker return, there is very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47919:8"/>
Danger of their receiving any Prejudice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but 'tis plain they will receive an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from both <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Moneys coming into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> quicker, and the Securities being much greater.</p>
               <p>It this Honourable Houſe ſhall not think it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to make ſo great an Alteration of ſo weighty a Concern, without firſt making Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment on ſome part.</p>
               <p>It is further humbly propoſed, That 2 <hi>s. per</hi> Quarter be laid on all Malt, as by former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, and the preſent Duty of Exciſe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: By ſuch a Propoſal (were it but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till the next Seſſion of Parliament) a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Experiment in all probability would by that time be made thereof, by which this Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable Houſe would be the better able to make Judgment, whether there really were ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to the King and Subject, as I have in the former Propoſal mentioned, and conſequently, whether it were for the Advantage of both, that ſuch an Alteration were made, and the Engagements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhould then happen to be, be transferred.</p>
               <p>It is humbly hoped 'twill appear, That even this Propoſal is not wholly deſtitute of Reaſons to juſtifie it, from the following Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:47919:9"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is humbly preſumed the 2 <hi>s.</hi> thus Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, will be as Univerſal as any Tax that has yet been Levied. Now if the Univerſality of a Tax proves its Equality, as indeed it ſeems (at leaſt to me) ſo to do, (unleſs in ſome very few particular Caſes) this Poſition allow'd, I may venture to ſay it will be as Equal as Univerſal, by reaſon every Perſon will pay his Proportion according to his Conſumption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Common Brewers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the 2 <hi>s.</hi> thus Levied, will not be ſo high Taxed by 2 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d. per</hi> Quarter or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, as they were when the Double Duty was laid on the Exciſe; for at 6 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel (which was the Double Duty) Two Barrels and Three Fourths amounts to 17 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d.</hi> 1/2. at 4 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel (which is the preſent Duty;) Two Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Three Fourths amounts to 13 <hi>s.</hi> 3/4 which deducted from 17 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d.</hi> 1/2. remains 4 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> 3/4. Two Shillings deducted, which is the preſent. propoſed Tax on each Quarter of Malt, ſtill there will remain 2 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> 3/4. This, I humbly preſume, is a demonſtration ſufficient, <hi>(viz.)</hi> To prove the Brewers have been more Taxed, than what they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47919:9"/>
will be by this Propoſal, and I preſume likewiſe 'twill ſcarce be denied, the preſent Affairs ſeem to want as great Supplies this Year, as any ſince the Revolution, and this is not propoſed for a longer time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thoſe that Brew Double Drinks will be in ſome meaſure by this: Tax (which they are not as it lies on the Drink) equally charged with the Common Brewers, which they at this time ſeem to have got the upper hand of, by taking Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Laws of Exciſe, which makes no other diſtinction in the Strength of Drink, than thus Generally, <hi>(viz.)</hi> for all Drink worth above 6 <hi>s. per</hi> Barrel to pay as Strong, and all under 6 <hi>s.</hi> as Small.</p>
               <p>To prove this Aſſertion, I need ſay no more than what every Perſons knows, That the one Conſumes at leaſt five times the Quantity in Proportion to every Barrel brewed, more than the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Diſtillers that brew Drink from Malt, on purpoſe to make Spirits or Strong Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will alſo be charged equally with the other Brewers in this; there needs nothing I preſume<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:47919:10"/>
to evince the Truth of this Aſſertion. I humbly beg leave to take notice of thoſe ſort of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen the Diſtillers in this place, though alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether foreign to this preſent Subject, but ought to have been in the former Propoſal; that is, <hi>(viz.)</hi> They Conſume great quantities of Malt; likewiſe, they commit great Frauds, many bad Debts contracted, and a great Charge to His Majeſty for the Management of it: All which would be prevented, if the whole Tax was laid on Malt, and the few other Materials the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillers uſe in their Buſineſs, which are not very many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That there ought to be a difference between Private Families brewing their own Drink, and Drink, brewed by the Common Brewers, or Retailers for Sale, does appear by the firſt Inſtitution of this Tax; for by the Acts of Parliaments relating to thoſe Matters, none ought to pay that Duty but ſuch as was ſuppoſed to make Profit by what they brewed; <hi>ergo,</hi> a difference is juſt, eſpecially if made, by an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity too great to be queſtioned (at leaſt by me, or any private Perſon) an Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47919:10"/>
If this Honourable Houſe ſhall not think ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the former Propoſals worthy of being complied with, I humbly beg leave to inform this Honourable Houſe, what in all probability the preſent Frauds of the Brewers do amount to, being ſuch, as it's to be feared, if this Honourable Houſe does not take ſome Care to prevent them, will mightily encreaſe, even beyond one Third Part of that Revenue, notwithſtanding the great Charge (not to mention the great Trouble) His Majeſty is at, at preſent, and the greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps (under the preſent Laws of Exciſe) he muſt be at hereafter, to keep it at the Ebb it's now at, <hi>viz.</hi> That only one Third Part be defrauded.</p>
               <p>To Prove which, 'tis but looking back to what former Years has produced, and comparing them with the latter, when they had not ſuch Temptations to Defraud as now they have; by reaſon the Duty even at this time is almoſt dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what then it was, and has been almoſt treble ſince His Preſent Majeſty's Reign, which will not be denied, I preſume, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That they have a much greater Temptation to put them upon the Contrivance of Frauds more now than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; For the PENALTIES are the ſame now as then, which is all the Check the Brewers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47919:11"/>
have. The Trouble and Charge they are at in committing their Frauds are the ſame, and not other than heretofore. The Exciſe when at 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel Strong, and 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel Small, did amount to about 680334 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> now at 4 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel Strong, and 1 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel Small, does amount to about 900000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> according to the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Duty, that is (from 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> Strong and 6 <hi>d.</hi> ſmall, to 4 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> Strong and to 1 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> Small, which is almoſt double; the Exciſe ought to come to at leaſt 1330000 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Computation it comes ſhort 430000 <hi>l. per Annum:</hi> Suppoſe an allowance of 30000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> be made for the Humour of this Town as well as the Country, running more of late (as is hinted in the firſt Propoſal) upon the very Strong or Double Ales than formerly, when the Exciſe amounted to the above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sum of 1330000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> Suppoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an allowance of 20000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> be made, for the Declenſion of the Brewing Trade of late years; though I ſhould think it no very great Task to prove, were it neceſſary, That that Trade of late is not in the leaſt declined. But I ſhall have room to make large allowances; therefore,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47919:11"/>
leſt that Objection ſhould ariſe, that alſo ismade here out. Suppoſe likewiſe an allowance of 10000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> be made in the ſtead of Exciſe on the Retailers of Coffee, which is more than ever was received by that Duty, when the Exciſe did amount to 680334 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> that Duty helped to make up the aforeſaid Sum, which at this time is on the Berry, and the Duty received at the Cuſtom-Houſe. Suppoſe likewiſe the Diſtillery be the ſame now as then, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Additional Duty on it, though in fact it is conſiderably advanced even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Additional Duty. All theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions amount to but 60000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> which deducted from 430000 <hi>l.</hi> there will ſtill remain 370000 <hi>l.</hi> 'Tis to be ſuppoſed that even then (when the Exciſe was at but 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel Strong, and 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel Small) the Brewers were not all Puritans; but ſuppoſe an Allowance be made for the then ſuppos'd Frauds of 30000 <hi>l.</hi> (though upon a Nicer Examination, there would be good reaſon to ſuſpect twice that Sum did not ſerve their Turns) then the Brewers Frauds will amount to Four Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> which is conſiderably above One Third Part. There might be much
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47919:12"/>
more ſaid to ſwell the aforeſaid 400000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> to a much greater Sum; but it is to be fear'd that even that's much too great to be well ſpared at this time. I humbly beg leave to ſhew this Honourable Houſe, wherein in my humble Opinion, the Frauds of Brewers are Prejudicial to the King, to the Subjects in General, and to the Trade it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Theſe Frauds are a Diſappointment to the King, by Reaſon that thereby the Excife does not anſwer the Sum it was given for; Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Fund to the Lender of Monies is not ſo Good or Large, as if it did fully An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are prejudicial to the Publick in General, by reaſon that if the Brewers paid for all they brew'd (as in Conſcience and Truth they ought) the leſs Taxes would ſerve turn, Conſequently, are prejudicial to the Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Theſe Frauds are prejudicial to the Brewing Trade; Every Perſon that knows the Brewing Trade, knows the greater the Trade,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47919:12"/>
the greater Opportunity they have to Defraud; Inſomuch, that the very ſmall Brewers can ſcarce Defraud any, the great Brewers having ſuch advantage, do ſell Stronger or better Drink, more Meaſure, and Cheaper than the Leſſer ones can, who by reaſon of the want of ſuch great Trades, have not ſuch great Advantages by Frauds; the leſſer Brewers by this means (as is ſaid in the Firſt Propoſal) cannot be ſuppoſed to have any Cuſtomers that can make good Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for what they buy of them, for if they could, no doubt they would apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the great Brewers, where they will receive ſuch viſible Advantages, different from what the leſſer Brewers can afford them, ſo that what few good Cuſtomers the leſſer Brewers can be ſuppoſed to have, they get nothing by, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps loſe; ſince then, the only Cuſtomers the leſſer Brewers have that they can hope to get by are bad, it will not be denied, I preſume, that the Trade thereby is greatly prejudiced; there will alſo this Conſequence neceſſarily follow (if the Trade it ſelf be thus prejudiced) the Publick will be yet further prejudiced, who will be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to bear ſome Tax levied on them to make good ſuch Deficiency, as may accrue therefrom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47919:13"/>
The Prevention of which, in my Humble Opinion, lies moſt properly and intirely in the Breaſt of this Honourable Houſe, that it may be prevented without any other Laws than what already are made, there is no doubt; But what's the Conſequence? Perhaps it will coſt as much to have it done, as will be ſaved, which is the ſame thing, almoſt, as if it were permitted; it cannot be imagined ſuch an Abuſe wou'd have been permitted ſo long, did it lie in the Power of Art, with a Reaſonable Charge to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it; but when we come to reflect under whoſe Management this Affair has been for this many Years paſt, and at preſent is, namely that Honourable Perſon who is at the Head of the Treaſury, there will not be the leaſt hope left us to believe any Judgment or Art hath been wanting, or can be improved, but what muſt neceſſarily owe its birth to this Honourable Houſe, and where thoſe Grievances can beſt be Redreſs'd.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe there were a Penalty inflicted, that every Brewer that ſhould erect and make uſe of a Private Back, a Private Tun, or a Private Store-houſe, ſhould pay 500 <hi>l.</hi> That every Brewer that ſhould Conceal the Quantity of a Barrel of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47919:13"/>
Strong Beer, Ale, or Small Beer from the Sight of the Gager, ſhould pay 15 <hi>l.</hi> for each Barrel; That every Brewer that ſhould mix Small Beer to Strong Beer or Ale, after the Gager has taken his Morning Gage, unleſs it be in the Preſence of a Gager, to pay for every Barrel ſo mix'd 15 <hi>l.</hi> For denial of Entry 50 <hi>l.</hi> and the other Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Proportion, and a Plentiful Reward out thereof to the Informer. I ſay, did this Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſe think it adviſeable, that ſome ſuch Penalties were Inflicted, not any Brewer of them all would dare attempt committing the leaſt kind of Fraud; by which, 'tis plain, the great Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance before ſpoken of, would be Redreſs'd by ſuch Penalties, for the Brewer has even under the preſent Penalties theſe Conſiderations, <hi>(viz.)</hi> What Advantage he is like to reap; the hazard he runs; which are three ſorts, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, the Charge he is to be at, and the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he is neceſſitated to Repoſe in his Servants, which, to ſay the Truth, are not Perſons of the greateſt Faith; Suppoſe the Maſter would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Fraud, and run the hazard of the ſuppoſed Penalties, he would not dare to intruſt his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants therewith, and without their Privity the Maſter cannot commit the Fraud; Beſides, by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47919:14"/>
ſuch Penalties (as is before ſpoken of) His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would ſave at leaſt 40000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> in the Management; for where there is a Neceſſity now to imploy Four Officers, Two would ſerve turn, and ſo in proportion in moſt of the other Imployments. I humbly hope it will appear by theſe following Reaſons, that ſuch Penalties are not only of uſe to the King, to the Publick in General, by Redreſſing the Great Grievances that fall out in the matter of the Exciſe, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality and Preſervation of the Trade it ſelf which I humbly preſume have before ſufficiently prov'd) but alſo, that every Brewer will be left deſtitute of the leaſt ground to Complain thereof, Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, will be preſumed to be Juſt and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
               <p>As thus, Every Brewer that ſhews the Gagers all he hath Brewed, and does not Conceal or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud any, is not Subject to the Penalties; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, he will have no cauſe to Complain, if he Defrauds not, he will not have <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thing to pay, I mean of the Penalties; He that will by Day-light burn his Fingers, cannot expect leſs than to feel the ſmart thereof.</p>
               <p>All the Objection that be rais'd againſt it; in my humble Opinion, is this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> if the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47919:14"/>
Brewers Servants ſhould Defraud any without the Maſter's privity, (ſuppoſed to do it on purpoſe to get the Reward propoſed to the Informer) it would be a Hardſhip upon the Maſters. True, I ſay ſo too; but there is this Remedy provided by the preſent Laws of Exciſe, (for that very purpoſe) that it doth lie in the Breaſt of the Commiſſioners, to mitigate any Penalty to any degree they pleaſe, taking nothing leſs than the double Duty and the Charge the Officer is at in finding out the Fraud; It will not be ſuppos'd, I preſume, any thing that has but a Countenance like that, would be Inflicted by the Commiſſioners, that make no profit thereby, but ſet to deal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually between the King and the Brewer. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſume, what is ſaid before, is ſufficient to Convince any Perſon, at leaſt this Unbyaſs'd Honourable Houſe, that the Objection is fully Anſwer'd; and I defy the Brewers themſelves, I mean the Great ones that have made large Eſtates ſolely out of Frauds, to make any other Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and for the leſſer Brewers, (the greater Number of the two) I will take the Liberty to Anſwer for them, that they ſhall (if requir'd) Petition this Honourable Houſe that ſuch an Act ſhould paſs for the Preſervation of their Trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:47919:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That upon a Modeſt Computation, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Brewer that makes uſe of a Private Back, a Private Tun, or Private Store-Houſe, of but a Moderate Size or Bigneſs, makes at leaſt 20 <hi>l. per</hi> Week, which uſed but ſix Months will make 480 <hi>l.</hi> which will almoſt Anſwer the Penalties propoſed. This, in my humble Opinion, ſhews, the Penalties propoſed are not Extravagant.</p>
               <p>If any Part of the Foregoing Matter ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to prove Advantageous either to the King or to the Subject, I ſhall obtain my Ends: The Whole is humbly Submitted to that Great and Honourable Houſe the Houſe of Commons their Great Wiſdom.</p>
