            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by her own hand, &amp; delivered to Capt.
Richardſon Keeper of Newgate.</head>
            <p>NOt knowing whether I ſhall be ſuffered, or able, becauſe of weakneſſes
that are upon me, thro my hard &amp; cloſe impriſonment, to ſpeak at the
place of Execution, I have wrote theſe few Lines, to fignify that I am
reconciled to the wayes of my God towards me, tho it be in wayes I
looked not for, &amp; by terrible things, yet in righteouſneſs; for having given me
life, he ought to have the diſpoſing of it, when &amp; where he pleaſes to call for
it; and I deſire to offer up my all to him, it being but my reaſonable ſervice, &amp;
alſo the firſt terms Chriſt offers, that he that will be his diſciple, muſt forſake
all &amp; follow him: and therfore let none think hard, or be diſcouraged at what hath
happened unto me; for he doth nothing without cauſe in all that he hath done
unto us, he being holy in all his wayes, &amp; righteous in all his works; and it
is but my Lott in common with poor deſolate <hi>Zion</hi> at this day; neither do I find
in my heart the leaſt regret for any thing that I have done in the ſervice of my
Lord &amp; Mr. C. Jeſus, in ſecuring &amp; ſuccouring any of his poor ſufferers, that have
ſhewed favour to his righteous cauſe, which cauſe, tho it be now faln &amp; trampled
on, as if it had not been anoynted, yet it ſhall revive, &amp; God will plead it at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rate than ever he hath done yet, with all its oppoſers &amp; malicious haters; and
therefore let all that love &amp; fear him, not omit the leaſt duty that comes to hand,
or lyes before them, knowing that now Chriſt hath need of them, &amp; expects they
ſhould ſerve him; &amp; I deſire to bleſs his holy name, that he hath made me uſefull
in my generation, to the comfort &amp; relief of many deſolate ones, that the bleſſing
of thoſe that were ready to periſh hath come upon me, &amp; been helpt to make the
heart of the widow to ſing; &amp; I bleſs his holy name, that in all this, together with
what I was charged with, I can approve my heart to him, that I have done his
will, tho it doth croſs mans will; and the ſcriptures which ſatisfy me are <hi>Eſay.</hi>
16. 3, 4. <hi>Hide the out-caſts, bewray not him that wandreth; be thou a covert to
them from the face of the ſpoyler.</hi> And <hi>Ob. 12, 13, 14. Thou ſhouldeſt not have
delivered up thoſe of his that did remain in the day of diſtreſs:</hi> but men ſay, you
muſt give them up, or you ſhall dye for it; now who to obey, judge ye; ſo that I
have cauſe to rejoyce, &amp; be exceeding glad, in that I ſuffer for righteouſneſs
ſake, &amp; that I am accounted worthy to ſuffer for well-doing, &amp; that God hath
accepted any ſervice from me, which hath been done in ſincerity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho mixt with
manifold infirmities, which he hath been pleaſed for Chriſts ſake to cover &amp;
forgive And now as concerning my crime as it is called, alas! it was but a little one,
&amp; might well become a Prince to forgive. (But he that ſhews no mercy, ſhall
find none.) And I may ſay of it in the language of <hi>Jonathan, I did but taſte a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38434:2"/>
little hony, &amp; lo I muſt dye for it;</hi> I did but relieve an unworthy, poor, diſtreſſed
family, &amp; lo I muſt dye for it; well, I deſire in the Lamb-like nature of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
to forgive all that are concerned, &amp; to ſay, Lord, lay it not to their charge;
but I fear it will not; nay I believe, when he comes to make inquiſition for
blood, it will be found at the door of the furious Judge, who becauſe I could not
remember things through my dauntedneſs at <hi>Burton</hi>'s wife &amp; Daughter's witneſs,
&amp; my ignorance, took advantage thereat, &amp; would not hear me when I had call'd
to mynd that which I am ſure would have invalidated the evidence; &amp; tho he
granted ſomething of the ſame kind to another, he denyed it to me at that
tyme: my blood will alſo be found at the door of the unrighteous Jury, who found
me guilty upon the ſingle oath of an out-lawd man; for there was none but his
Oath about the mony, who is no legall witneſs, tho he be pardoned, his out-lawry
not being reverſed, the law requiring 2 witneſſes in poynt of Treaſon, and
then about my going with him to the place mentioned <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Hope)</hi> it was by
his own word before he could be out-lawd; for it was but about 2 monthes
after his <hi>abſconding,</hi> ſo that tho he was in a <hi>Proclamation</hi> yet not high Treaſon, as
I am informed, whereby I am clearly murdered; and alſo bloody Mr. <hi>Atterbery,</hi>
who hath ſo unſatiably hunted after my life, tho it is no profit to him, yet thro
the ill will he bears me, left no ſtone unturned, as I have ground to believe, till
he brought it to this, and ſhewed favour to <hi>Burton,</hi> who ought to have dyed for his
own fault, &amp; not to have bought his life with mine: and Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> who
is cruell &amp; ſevere to all under my circumſtances, &amp; who did at that time, without
all mercy &amp; pity, haſten my ſentence, &amp; held up my hand that it might be given;
All which, together with the great one of all, by whoſe power all theſe &amp; multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
more of cruelties are done, I do heartily &amp; freely forgive as againſt me, but
as it is done in an implacable mind againſt the Lord Chriſt &amp; his righteous cauſe
&amp; followers, I leave it to him, who is the avenger of all ſuch wrong who will
tread upon Princes as upon mortar, &amp; be terrible to the Kings of the earth; &amp;
know this alſo, that tho you are ſeemingly fixed, &amp; becauſe of the power in your
hands, are weighing out your violence, &amp; dealing with a deſpiteful mind, becauſe of
the old &amp; new hatred, by impoveriſhing &amp; every way deſtreſſing thoſe you have
got under you, yet unleſs you can ſecure <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> &amp; all his holy Angells, you
ſhall never do your buſineſs, nor your hand accompliſh your enterprizes; for he
will be upon you ere you are aware; and therefore that you would be wiſe, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
&amp; learn, is the deſire of her that finds no mercy from you.</p>
