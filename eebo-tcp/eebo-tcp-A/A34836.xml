            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Have been often tempted to admire, since the Publishing Mr. <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's</hi> Papers, by what fate so excellent a <hi>Satyr</hi> upon the <hi>Times,</hi> and so worthy the Author, as the <hi>Puritan</hi> and <hi>Papist,</hi> should escape the ingenious <hi>Publisher,</hi> when at the same time his Copy upon <hi>Brutus,</hi> and that upon the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Lincoln's</hi> enlargement from the <hi>Tower</hi> have met with the good fortune to have place there, although they are in some sort, <hi>Satyrs</hi> upon <hi>himself</hi> and so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy his Name, and the good Company they appear in: that considering the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of their <hi>Arguments,</hi> we might, it may be have expected them in Mr. <hi>Waller's</hi> Works rather than Mr. <hi>Cowley's;</hi> and from thence to have been purged by the Wisdom of <hi>later</hi> and more <hi>correct Editions</hi> of his <hi>Book,</hi> together with the <hi>Penegyrick</hi> to <hi>Oliver,</hi> and the <hi>Elegy</hi> on his <hi>Death,</hi> called the <hi>Storm.</hi> Both which seem, in a manner, to have inherited the <hi>Lot,</hi> no less than the <hi>Guilt</hi> of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper, upon whom they were made: the former, claiming the <hi>Laurel,</hi> but that it wanted abetter <hi>Title</hi> to the crown: and the latter, to have so insensibly disappeared on a sudden as if by a resembling fate, it had been snatcht away in the same <hi>Storm</hi> in which the <hi>Tyrant</hi> himself was lost.</p>
                  <p>Whether it were an <hi>Exeess</hi> of <hi>Modesty</hi> in Mr. <hi>Cowly</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it as an <hi>Abortive,</hi> and so, though it had appeared formerly in <hi>Print</hi> to have no place in his Collection, but to take its fortune with the <hi>Blossoms</hi> and unripe follies of his Youth: Or whether it were an <hi>Excess of good Nature</hi> in him that sentenced it to suffer, merely as it was a Satyr and so lookt upon as a piece of persecution, and

like <hi>Draco's</hi> Laws, written in Blood, as we find the best Natures inclined to check and be angry at themselves when once the fit of Choler is over; I say whether of these were the cause of suppressing it I shall not now presume to examine.</p>
                  <p>But because under the Color of doing <hi>Justice</hi> to the <hi>Satyre,</hi> I may be thought to have done <hi>Wrong</hi> to Mr. <hi>Cowly,</hi> and only to have borrowed his Name; to enhance the value of what comes with it, its own recommendation.

                        <head>THE Assembly-man.</head>
                        <p>AN <hi>Assembler</hi> is part of the <hi>States'</hi> Chattels: nor <hi>Priest,</hi> nor <hi>Burgess,</hi> but a <hi>Participle</hi> that shark's upon both. He was chosen, as Sir <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> because he knew least of all his Profession: not by the Votes of a Whole Diocese, but by one whole Parliament-man. He ha's sate four years <hi>towards</hi> a new Religion, but in the interim left none at all: as his Masters, the <hi>Commons</hi> had along Debate <hi>whether Canáles or no Candles,</hi> but all the mean while sate still in the Dark: And therefore when the Moon quits her oldLight, and has acquir'd no new, Astronomeres say she is in her <hi>Synodes.</hi> Shew me such a Picture of <hi>Judas</hi> as the <hi>Assembler,</hi> (a grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, false, Reforming Brother; rail's at <hi>Waste</hi> spent upon the <hi>Anointed;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes most those Hands which <hi>Ordain'd</hi> him; brings in <hi>men with swords and staves;</hi> and all for Money from the Honourable <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees:)</hi> One Touch more (a Line tyed to his Name-sake <hi>Elder-tree)</hi> had made him <hi>Judas,</hi> Root and Branch. This <hi>Assembly</hi> at first was a full Century; which should be reckon'd as the Scholiast's <hi>Hecatomb,</hi> by their Feet, not Heads: or count them by Scores, for in things without Heads Six score go to an Hundred. They would be a New <hi>Septuagint;</hi> the Old translated Scripture out of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berw</hi> into <hi>Greek,</hi> these turn in to <hi>four shillings a day?</hi> And and these <hi>Assemblers</hi> were begot in one day, as <hi>Hercules's</hi> fifty Bastards all in one night. Their first List was sprinkled with some names of Honour, (Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> Dr. <hi>Morley-</hi>Dr. <hi>Hammond, &amp;c,)</hi> But these were <hi>Divines;</hi> too worthy to mix with such <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Ministers,</hi> and would not <hi>Assemble</hi> without the <hi>Royal Call.</hi> Nay, the first List had one Archbishop, one Bishop, and an Half, (for Bishop <hi>Brownrigg</hi> was then but <hi>Elect.)</hi> But now their <hi>Assembly</hi> (as Philosophers think the World) consists of <hi>Atoms;</hi> petty small Levites, whose <hi>Parts</hi> are not <hi>perceptible.</hi> And yet these inferior postern Teachers have intoxicated <hi>England</hi> (for a man some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grow's drunk by a Glister.) When they all meet, they shew Beasts in <hi>Asrick</hi> by promiscuous coupling engender Monsters. Mr <hi>Selden</hi> visit's them (as <hi>Persians</hi> use) to see <hi>wild Asses</hi> fight: when the <hi>Commons</hi> have tyr'd him with their new Law, these Bretheren refresh him with their mad Gospel: They lately were gravell'd 'twixt <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Jerico;</hi> they knew not the dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance 'twixt those two places; one cry'd twenty miles, another ten, 'twas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded seven, for this reason, that <hi>Fishwas brought from</hi> Jericho <hi>to</hi> Jerusalem
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103623:10"/>
                           <hi>market:</hi> Mr <hi>Selden</hi> smil'd and said <hi>perhaps the Fish, was salt Fish</hi> and so stopp'd their mouths. Earl <hi>Philip</hi> goes thither to hear them <hi>spend;</hi> when he heard them toss their <hi>National, Provincial, Classical, Congregational;</hi> he swore <hi>damnably,</hi> that a pack of good Dogs made better Musick: His Allusion was porper, since the <hi>Elder's Maid</hi> had a four-legg'd Husband. To speak truth, this <hi>Assembly</hi> is the <hi>two Houses</hi> Tiring-room where the <hi>Lords</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> put on their Visards and Masques of Religion. And their <hi>Honors</hi> have so <hi>sifted</hi> the Church, that at last they have found the <hi>Bran</hi> of the Clergy. Yet such poor Church-menders must Reform and shuffle: though they find Church Government may a thousand wayes be changd for the worse, but not one way for the better. These have lately publish'd <hi>Annotations</hi> on the Bible, where their first Note (on the word <hi>CREATE)</hi> is a Libel against Kings for creating of Honors. Their <hi>Annotation</hi> on <hi>Jacob's</hi> two Kids, is, that <hi>two Kids are too much for one man's supper:</hi> but <hi>he had</hi> (say they) <hi>but one Kid and the other made Sauce.</hi> They observe upon <hi>Herod,</hi> what a Tyrant he was, to kill Insants under two years old, <hi>without</hi> giving <hi>them legal Trial,</hi> that they might speake for themselves. Commonly they follow the <hi>Geneva</hi> Margin, as those Sea-men who understood not the <hi>Compass</hi> crept a long the Shore. But <hi>I</hi> hear they threaten a <hi>secoud Edition,</hi> and in the interim thrust forth a paultry <hi>Catechism,</hi> which expounds Nine <hi>Commandements,</hi> and Eleven Articles of the <hi>Creed.</hi> Of late they are much in love with <hi>Chronograms,</hi> because (if possible) they are duller than <hi>Anagrams;</hi> O how they have torn the poor Bishops names to pick out the number 666! little dreaming that a whole Bakers dozen of their own Assembly have that beastly number in each of their Names, and that as exactly as their <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist's of 666 words. But though the <hi>Assembler's</hi> Brains are Lead, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is Brass; for he damned such as held two benefices, while him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has four or five, besides his Concubine <hi>Lecture.</hi> He is not against <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities,</hi> but <hi>Dualities;</hi> He says it is unlawful to have two of his own, though four of other mens; and observes how the Hebrew word sor <hi>Life</hi> has no singular number. Yet it is some relief to a sequestred person to see two <hi>Assemblers</hi> snarl for his Tithes; for of all kind of Beasts none can match an <hi>Assembler</hi> but an <hi>Assembler.</hi> He never enters a Church by the Door, but clambers up through a Window of <hi>Scquestration,</hi> or steals in through Vaults and Cellars by Clandestine Contracts with an Expecting Patron. He is most sure no Law can hurt him, for Laws dyed in <hi>England</hi> the year before the <hi>Assembler</hi> was born. The best way to hold him, is (as our King <hi>Richard</hi> bound the King of <hi>Cyprus)</hi> in <hi>silver chains.</hi> He loves to discourse of the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> because her streets are of fine <hi>Gold;</hi> and yet could like <hi>London</hi> as well, were <hi>Cheapside</hi> paved with the <hi>Philosopher's stone.</hi> Nay, he would say his Prayers with <hi>Beads,</hi> if he might have a Set made of all Diamonds: This, this is it which tempts him to such mad Articles against the <hi>Loyal Clergy,</hi>

But the <hi>Assembler</hi> himself can drink Widows Tears though their husbands are not dead. Sure, if <hi>Paracelsus's</hi> Doctrine were true, (that <hi>to eat creatures alive will perpetuate man's life)</hi> the <hi>Assembler</hi> were imortal, for he swallows quick Men, Wives, and Children; and devours <hi>Lives</hi> as well as <hi>Livings,</hi> as if he were born in that Pagan Province where <hi>None might marry till he had Killed twelveChristians.</hi> This makes him kneel to Lieutenant General <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> (as <hi>Indians</hi> to the Devil;) for he saw how <hi>Oliver</hi> first threw—, then—and can with a wink do as much for—: Like <hi>Milo</hi> in the <hi>Olympicks,</hi> by practising on a <hi>Calf</hi> grew strong enough for a <hi>Bull,</hi> and could with ease give a lift to an <hi>Asse.</hi> The great Turk was sending his Ambassador, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate the <hi>Assemblies</hi> Proceedings against the <hi>Christians;</hi> He Ordered them Thanks for Licencing his <hi>Alcoran</hi> to be printed in <hi>English;</hi> but hearing <hi>Ottoman Cromwel</hi> had talked of <hi>marching to the Walls of Constantinople,</hi> that Embassy was stopt.

He has now got power to visit the Universities; where these blinking <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors</hi> look on eminent Scholars (as the Blind-man who saw <hi>men</hi> like <hi>Trees)</hi> as Timber growing within the Root-and-Branch <hi>Ordinance.</hi> The <hi>Assembler</hi> has now lest Scholars so poor, they have scarce Rags wherewith to make Paper. A man would think the <hi>Two houses</hi> intend to transport the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,</hi> since they load <hi>Asses</hi> with Colledge-Revenues. For though these <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblers</hi> made themselves <hi>Heads,</hi> they are rather <hi>Hands</hi> of Colledges, for they all are takers; and take all. And yet they are such creeping Tyrants, that Scholars are Expell'd the two <hi>Universities,</hi> as the old <hi>Thracians,</hi> forc'd from their Countrey by Rats and Mice. So that Learning now is so much advanced, as <hi>Arrowsmith's</hi> Glass-eye sees more then his natural. They never admit a good scholar to a Benefice, for the <hi>Assemblies</hi> Balance is the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Sodom,</hi> where Iron swims and Feathers sink. Their Divinity-Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations are with Women or Lay-men; and 'tis only on one Question <hi>(Episcopacy)</hi> where the <hi>Assembler</hi> talks all that he and his friends can say,

(though his best <hi>medium</hi> to prove <hi>Presbyters</hi> more antient than <hi>Bishops,</hi> is, that <hi>Scribes, Pharisees, Priests</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> where before the <hi>Apostols;)</hi> Yet if a Scholar or good Argument come, he flies them as much as if they were his Text. This made him curse Dr. <hi>Steward,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lancy</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and had he not had more Brass in his Face than in his Kitchin, he had hang'd himself at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> and ended with that <hi>Treaty.</hi> For he has naught of <hi>Logick,</hi> but her <hi>clutch'd fist,</hi> and rail's at <hi>Philosophy</hi> as Beggars do at Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen. He has very bad luck when he deals in <hi>Philologie,</hi> as one of them (and that no mean man) who in his preface to the Reader, sayes, that St. <hi>Paul had read Eustathius upon Homer,</hi> though the <hi>Apostle dyed a</hi> thousand years before <hi>Eustathius</hi> was born. The <hi>Assembers</hi> Dyet is strangely different, for he dines wretchedly on dry Bread at <hi>Westminster;</hi> four <hi>Assemblers</hi> for 13 pence: But this sharpens and <hi>Whets him</hi> for supper, where he feeds gratis with his City-Landlord, to whom he brings a huge Stomach and News; for which Cramm'd Capons cram him. He screws into Families where is some rich Daughter or Heir; but whoever takes him into their bosom, will dye like <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> VVhen it rains he is Coach'd (a <hi>Classis</hi> of them together) rouling his Eyes to mark who beholds him. His shortest things are his hair and his Cloack. His hair is cut to the figure of 3; two high Cliffs run up his Temples, whose Cap of shorn hair shoots down his Forehead, with Creeks indented, where his Ears ride at Anchor. Had this false Prophet been carryed with <hi>Habbakuk,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> had caught fast hold of his <hi>Ears,</hi> and led him as he leads his Auditory. His Eyes are part of his Tithe at <hi>Easter,</hi> which he boyles at each Sermon. He has two Mouths, his Nose is one, for he speaks through both. His hands are not in his Gloves but his Gloves in his Hands, for 'twixt sweatings that is, Sermons, he handles little else, except his dear Mammon. His Gown (I mean his Cloak) reaches but his pockets: when he rides in that mantle, with a Hood on his shoulders and a hat above both, is he not then his own <hi>Man of sin</hi> with the <hi>Triple Crown?</hi> you would swear some honest Carpenter dress'd him, and made him the Tunnel of a Country Chimney. His Doublet and Hose are of dark Blew, a grain deeper than pure <hi>Coventry:</hi> but of late he's in Black, since the Loyal Clergy were persecuted into Colors. His two longest things are his <hi>Nayls</hi> and his <hi>Prayer.</hi> But the cleanest thing about him is his <hi>Pulpit-Cushion,</hi> for he still beats the Dust out of it. To do him right, commonly he wears a pair of good Lungs, whereby he turns the Church into a Belfry, for his Clapper makes such a Din, you cannot hear the <hi>Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> for the <hi>Tinkling.</hi> If his pulpit be large he walks his Round, and speaks as from a Garrison, (his own Neck is Palizado'd with a Ruff) VVhen he first enters his prayer before Sermon, he winks and gasps, and gasps and winks, as if he prepared to preach in another world, He seems in a slumber, then in a Dream; then rumbles a while; at last sounds forth, and then throws

so much Dirt and Non-sence towards Heaven, as he durst not offer to a Member of Parliament. Now because Scripture bids him <hi>not curse the King in</hi> his <hi>thought,</hi> he does it in his Pulpit by word of mouth; though heaven strike him Dumb in the very Act, as it did <hi>Hill</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who while he pray'd; <hi>Depose Him, O Lord, who would depose us,</hi> was made the <hi>dumb Devil.</hi> This (one would think) should <hi>gargle</hi> his foul mouth. For his only hope why God should hear him against the King, is the Devil himself (that great <hi>Assembler)</hi> was heard against <hi>Job.</hi> His whole prayer is such an irrational Bleating, that (without a Metaphor) 'tis the <hi>Calves of his Lipps:</hi> And commonly 'tis larded with fine new words, as <hi>Savingable, Muchly, Christ-Jesusnes,</hi> &amp;c. and yet he has the face to preach against <hi>Prayer in an unknown Tongue.</hi> Sometimes he is founder'd, and then there is such hideous Coughing: But that is very seldom, for he can glibly run over Non-sence, as an empty Cart trundles down a Hill.

'Tis true, they have a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory,</hi> but 'tis good for nothing but <hi>Adoniram,</hi> who sold the <hi>Original</hi> for 400 l. And the Book must serve both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> as the <hi>Directory Needle</hi> point's North and South. The <hi>Assembler's</hi> only ingenuity is, that he prays for an <hi>ex tempore</hi> Spirit, since his Conscience tells him he has no Learning. His prayer thus ended, he then looks round, to observe the Sex of his Congregation, and accordingly turns the Apostle's Men, Fathers, and Brethren, into Dear Brethren and Sisters. For, his usual Auditory is most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part Female; and as many Sisters flock to him, as at <hi>Paris</hi> on Saint <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets</hi> day, when all come to Church that are, or hope to be with child that year. He divides his Text as he did the Kingdom, makes one part fight against<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> another: or as <hi>Burges</hi> divides the Dean of <hi>Paul's</hi> House, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to parts, but Tenements, that is, so as 'twill yield most money. And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly they are Tenements; for each part must be dwelt upon, though himself comes near it but once a Quarter; and so his Text is rather let out than <hi>Divided.</hi> Yet sometimes (to shew his skill in <hi>Keckerman,)</hi> he <hi>Butchers</hi> a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103623:12"/>
Text, cuts it (just as the <hi>Levite</hi> did his <hi>Concubine)</hi> into many dead parts, breaking the sence and words all to pieces, and then they are not divided, but shattered like the Splinters of <hi>Don Quixot's</hi> Lance. If his Text be to the occasion, his first Dish is <hi>Apples of Gold, in Pictures of Silver;</hi> yet tells not the People what Pictures those were. HisSermon and prayer grin at each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one is <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> the other Independent, for he preaches up the <hi>Classes,</hi> yet prays for the Army. Let his Doctrine and Reason be what they will, his <hi>Use is still to save his Benefice and augment his Lecture.</hi> He talks much of <hi>Truth,</hi> but abhorrs <hi>Peace,</hi> lest it strip him as <hi>naked</hi> as <hi>Truth;</hi> and therefore hates a personal Treaty, unless with a Sister. He has a rare simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering way of expressions he calls a Marryed Couple <hi>Saints that enjoy the miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> &amp; a man Drunk, is <hi>a Brother full of the Creature.</hi> Yet at Wedding Sermons he is very familiar, &amp; (like that Picture in the Church at <hi>Leyden)</hi> shews <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve</hi> without <hi>Figleaves.</hi> AtFunerals he gives infallibleSigns that the Party is gone to Heaven; but his chief Mark of a <hi>child of God,</hi> is <hi>to be good to God's Ministers.</hi> And hence it is he calls his Preachment <hi>Manna,</hi> fitted not to his hearers <hi>Necessity,</hi> but their <hi>Palat;</hi> for 'tis to feed himself, not them. If he chance to tire, he refreshes himself with the Peoples Hum, as a Collar of Bells to chear up a Pack-horse.

He hates a Church where there is an <hi>Eccho,</hi> for it Robs him of his dear <hi>Repetition,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the Auditory as well as he. But of all Mortals I admire the <hi>Short-hand-men,</hi> who have the patience to write from his Mouth: had they the art to shorten it into Sense, they might write his whole Sermon on the back of their Nail. For his Invention consists in finding a way to speak nothing upon any thing; and were he in the <hi>Grand Seignior's</hi> power, he would lodge him with his <hi>Mutes;</hi> for <hi>Nothing</hi> and <hi>Nothing to purpose</hi> are all one. <hi>I</hi> wonder in conscience he can preach against <hi>Sleeping</hi> at his <hi>Opium-</hi>Sermons. He preaches indeed both in season and out of season; for he rayl's at Popery; when the Land is almost lost in Presbytery; and would cry out <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> in <hi>Noah's Flood.</hi> Yet all this he so acts with his Hands, that in this sence too his Preaching is an <hi>Handicraft.</hi> Nor can we complain that Plays
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103623:12"/>
are put down while he can preach; save only his <hi>Sermons</hi> have worse sence and less truth. But he blew down the Stage and preach'd up the <hi>Scaffold.</hi> And very wisely, lest men should track him, and find where he pilfers all his best <hi>Simile's,</hi> (the only thing wherein he is commendable, St <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self having cull'd Sentences from <hi>Menander's Thais,</hi> though 'twas his worst, that is, unchast Comedy.) Sometimes the <hi>Assembler</hi> will venture at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, and then (with the translator of <hi>Don Quixot)</hi> he mistakes <hi>Sobs</hi> and <hi>Sighs</hi> for <hi>Eggs</hi> and <hi>Collops.</hi> But commonly (for want of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin)</hi> he learns <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and streight is <hi>illuminated;</hi> that is, mad: his Brain is broke by a Brickbat cast from the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi> And yet this empty windy Teacher has <hi>Lectur'd</hi> a War quite round the Kingdom: he has found a <hi>Circulation of blood</hi> for <hi>Destruction</hi> (as famous <hi>Harvey</hi> for <hi>Preservation)</hi> of Mankind. 'Twas easie to foresee a great Mortality, when Ravens were heard in all <hi>Corporations.</hi> For, as Multitude of Froggs presage a Pestilence, so croaking <hi>Lecturers</hi> foretold an <hi>Assembly.</hi> Men come to Church, as the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> went to Sacrifice, led by Crows. You have seen a small <hi>Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree</hi> grow in chinks and clefts of Church-walls, it seems rather a <hi>Weed</hi> than a <hi>Tree;</hi> which, lend it growth, makes a Rent in the Wall, and throws down the Church. Is not this the <hi>Assembler?</hi> grown from Schisms (which himself begot,) and if permitted, will make the Church but a <hi>Floor</hi> or <hi>Church-yard.</hi> Yet, for all this, he will be call'd <hi>Christ's Minister</hi> and Saint, as the Rebells against King <hi>John</hi> were the <hi>Army of God.</hi> Sure when they meet they cannot but smile; for the dullest amongst them needs must know that they all cheat the people; such gross, low impostors, that we die the death of the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> poyson'd by <hi>Mushromes.</hi> The old Heretickshad Skill &amp; Learning (some excuse for a Seduced Church; those were <hi>Scholars,</hi> but these <hi>Assemblers;</hi> whose very Brains (as <hi>Manichaeus's</hi> skin) are stuff'd with <hi>Chaff.</hi> For they study little, &amp; preach much, ever sick of a <hi>Diabetes:</hi> nor do they <hi>read,</hi> but <hi>weed</hi> Authors, picking up cheap &amp; refuse Notes, that with <hi>Caligula</hi> they gather Cockle-shells, &amp; with <hi>Domitian</hi> retire into theirStudie to catch Flies. At <hi>Fasts</hi> &amp; <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> the <hi>Assembler</hi> is the <hi>State's</hi> Trumpet; for then he doth not <hi>preach,</hi> but is <hi>blown;</hi> proclaims News very loud, the Trumpet and his Forehead being both of one Metall. (And yet, good man, he still prays for <hi>Boldness.)</hi> He hackneys out his Voice like a Cryer; and is a kind of <hi>Spiritual Agitant,</hi> receives Orders, and spreads them. In earnest the <hi>States</hi> can't want this Tool, for without him the <hi>Saints</hi> would scarce <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And if the Zealots chance to fly out, they are charm'd home by this <hi>Sounding Brass.</hi> There is not on earth a baser Sycophant; for he ever is chewing some <hi>Vote</hi> or <hi>Ordinance;</hi> and tells the People how <hi>savoury</hi> it is; like him who lick'd up the Emperor's spittle and swore 'twas sweet. Would the <hi>two Houses</hi> give him <hi>Cathedral Lands,</hi> he would prove <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> to be <hi>sure Divino:</hi> but should they offer him the <hi>Self-denying-

But yet (to their great comfort be it spoken) their whole seven years Sermons at <hi>Westminster</hi> are now to be sold in <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> and <hi>Precorner.</hi> Before a Battail the <hi>Assembler</hi> ever speaks to the Souldiers; and the holding up of his hands must be as necessary as <hi>Moses</hi>'s against the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </head>

                        <p>SInce nothing can be dearer unto poor Christians than <hi>Liberty,</hi> or the free exercise of their <hi>Judgments</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> which hath kindled that fire in the bowels of the three Kingdoms, which all the precious blood that hath been shed, during those late Troubles, hath not been able totally to extinguish: And since many of <hi>Us,</hi> whose Names are affixed, were so profitably instrumental in those late Combustions, as appears all along in our <hi>Sermons</hi> before the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable House of Parliament, in the Years 1642, 43, 44, 45, 46. in exciting the good people of this Nation, to seek and maintain their <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> against all <hi>Prelatical</hi> and <hi>Antichristian Imposition</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. And considering that the Little Finger of Apostasie from our first Love, would be a greater burden upon our <hi>Tender Consciences,</hi> than the Loyns of Episcopacy. We being more bound in Honour than <hi>Conscience,</hi> cannot totally desist; neither need any man fear, or so much as suspect, lest any Inconvenience or Alteration should happen in Religion, by the great diversity of Opinions, Tongues, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, tolerated amongst us, unless in the great <hi>Babel</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> that may possibly be pulled down and destroyed by this our <hi>notable Confusion;</hi> for, if the Gospel was wonderfully spread abroad by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans speaking in his own Language, and the very Enemies thereof astonished, and miraculously wrought into a belief of it: how it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be now obstructed in the free exercise of our <hi>Spiritual Gifts,</hi> with these our <hi>cloven</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> Tongues. And since many worthy persons from whom we might little expect it, but far less deserve it, out of their Goodness and Clemency, are pleased to encline to some <hi>Liberty,</hi> did not some persons, Aliens and Strangers to the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> take up a Reproach against us, as Persons reprobated into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility

of submission to Principles of <hi>Concord, Peace, and Order,</hi> in Church or State, never being able hitherto to come to any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency amongst our selves; The Ark of God having, for twenty years together, been exposed to by-ways, Streets, and worse places, for want of an Agreement amongst our own Brethren where to rest it, or how to entertain it. If this be our Case, and could we be sure of so much favour as <hi>Saul</hi> once desired of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that the <hi>Bishops</hi> would but <hi>honour</hi> us before the People, We would in a private Christian way, lay our hands upon our hearts, and acknowledge the hand of God, and the Justice thereof, in turning us out of his Vineyard, as wicked and <hi>unprofitable Servants,</hi> and to suffer the iniquity of our heels to overtake us; crying out with reverend Mr. <hi>Calamy, The Ark of God is justly departed from us;</hi> but being not yet thus assured, do hope the people will yet believe these to be only Bears skins lap'd about us by Episcopal hands: And therefore to the end that a <hi>Consistency,</hi> and <hi>Oneness</hi> of Judgment of the whole separating Brethren, and their Moderation, may be known unto all men, and that the World may know, that there is a Spirit of Rule and Government resting in us;</p>

                        <p>That the said <hi>Grand Commissioners and Farmers</hi> may have Power to require Mr. <hi>Gilbert Millington,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Luke Robinson,</hi> the lame Evangelist, to deliver up all such Articles, Orders, Books, Papers, and other Writings, as were transacted before the late Committee for Plundered Ministers; and likewise, all such as were passed and transacted before Mr. <hi>Philip Ney,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the now <hi>Grand Commissioners and Farmers,</hi> and hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Commissioners, or Spiritual Tryers,</hi> to the end the said Articles, Orders, Books, and other Papers, may be Printed and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and may be kept at the said Office upon Record for ever, and appointed to be the Book of <hi>Canons</hi> of the Seperated Churches.</p>
                        <p>All this being done, we may upon <hi>Scripture Grounds</hi> expect, that the Door of Hope may yet be open to Us, and our Children after us, to see the Travel of our Souls, and to set us into the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103623:19"/>
Promised Land, and to reap some of those Clusters of the Grapes of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which with so much Labor and Toyl of Body, and Mind were planted, especially in the Years of 1641, 42, 43, 44, 45. by many of Us, and other <hi>Precious</hi> Saints and Ministers of the Gospel, who are since fallen asleep, and have, we hope, reaped the Fruits of those Labors, the Lord having in that day put a mighty Spirit into Us, and set us as Watchmen upon the Towers of <hi>Israel,</hi> to cry mightily <hi>Curse ye Meroz, curse ye bitterly.</hi> Grant that those <hi>Heart-breaking Labors</hi> of Ours, those <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destroying Labors,</hi> those <hi>Kingdom-ruining</hi> Labors, those <hi>Gospel-scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing Labors,</hi> those <hi>Church-subverting Labors,</hi> those <hi>Soul-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding Labors</hi> of Ours may never be forgotten, but may be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as with the point of a Diamond, upon the Heart of the <hi>King,</hi> upon the Hearts of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> upon the Heart of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and upon the Hearts of all the People from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beersheba,</hi> that so in God's good time, we may receive our Reward Seven-fold into our own Bosoms, and that the Generations to come, may hear and fear, and do no more so wickedly.</p>
