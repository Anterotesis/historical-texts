            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
INTRODUCTION,
Containing the use of this
TREATISE.</head>
            <p>AS Diseases and Death are
marks of the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in the punishment of
Sin, So the Art of Physick
must be acknowledged a deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
from the transcendent Mercy
of the Great God, whereby the
crazie and sickly constitutions of
humane Bodies are supported, their
pains appeased, and Health resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
These, as well as his other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
render the Almighty most
glorious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94494:3"/>
The <hi>Observation</hi> deduced from
what precedes, informs us, That
those that usurp and exercise the
Art of Physick abusively and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,
do extremely Eclipse
Gods glory, by so diminishing of
his Mercy; and of this so weighty
a Sin, it is to be feared many <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks</hi>
and <hi>Little Apothecaries</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
the skirts of the City,
and Country Villages, do contract
a guilt, not only by administring
Physick ignorantly, and without
those qualifications that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary in a Physician,
but by over-rating the prices of
their Medicines, to that degree,
that mean Families by a fit of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
or two must unavoidably be
ruined in Estate, and too oft in
their Health. I must tell you, I
have oft seen Bills of <hi>Apothecaries</hi>
risen to twenty, &amp; sometimes thirty
pounds in the time of a Fortnight;
<pb facs="tcp:94494:3"/>
what is more, I have known an
<hi>Apothecaries</hi> Bill so extravagant,
that the Sum at the bottom of his
Account amounted to Fifty Pounds
in the space of Thirty Days, when
the Ingredients of the whole
Course could not be computed to
stand him in Forty Shillings: But,
that which sounds worse than all
this, is, that not long since an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary</hi>
of our Suburbs, to Nine
Patients, brought in Bills for less
than three quarters of a years Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
amounting to Fifteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pounds. Though at the same
time I must intimate to you, that
this is not the practice of our <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>-Apothecaries,
who not only
for discharging their Consciences
in the faithful Preparation of their
Medicines, but also for vending
them at reasonable Rates; may
vie with any others of that Trade
in all <hi>Europe;</hi> and therefore you
<pb facs="tcp:94494:4"/>
are not to suppose me here em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
in a designe of discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
you to make use of these
later, who are so necessary in the
Art of <hi>Physick,</hi> but only of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
my Duty to such, as are
exposed to be defrauded by some
Little <hi>Apothecaries</hi> of the Country
and skirts of the City, not onely
through their ill preparation of
Medicines, but also through their
unjust and avaricious Prices: So
that I do pretend hereby, First,
to instruct you, how to prepare
the most usual and ordinary Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
at your own Houses; which
cannot but be a great satisfaction
to you, in regard you are certain
they are well prepared, and that
the Ingredients are Sound and
Fresh; Likewise that you can
have your Medicines ready, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
attending the Apothecaries
leasure for him to bring them, or
<pb facs="tcp:94494:4"/>
without giving your self the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to send three or four times to
his Shop for them. Secondly, you
may be assured, that in so doing,
you shall save Nine Pounds in Ten,
or sometimes Forty Eight Pounds
in Fifty. Thirdly, by this means
you avoid being defrauded of your
Lives and Estates too, by <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks</hi>
and their Medicines, which
being so indifferently and rashly
used by many credulous Persons,
at all times and seasons, without
that particular regard had to their
Constitution, Age, Sex, Climate,
and Cause of Disease, must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily,
if not kill, at least destroy
the Temperament of their Bowels
and noble Parts.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed any further, I
am obliged to demonstrate, and
make it appear, in what manner,
and wherein this <hi>Treatise</hi> doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb facs="tcp:94494:5"/>
what is here promised.</p>
            <p>First then, I have pick'd out
such Medicines of the <hi>London-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensatory</hi>
as are most usual, which
being reduced to a small number,
may without any great defray of
charges, be kept ready at your
Houses. I have only made choice
of three or four fragrant Waters,
that are to serve for Cordial Juleps,
which in respect of Temperament,
may be mixt and qualified for use
in hot or cold Distempers. What
concerns the vast number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
simple distilled Waters, I do
wittingly reject them, as being so
little imbued with the vertue of
the Simples whence they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled,
that Decoctions, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Infusions, or Expressions of
Juices made of the same Simples,
or Spirits distilled from them, are
experienced to be a million stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
which as your Disease may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
<pb facs="tcp:94494:5"/>
are to be prescribed, and
taught you by your <hi>Family-Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician.</hi>
Likewise compound Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Syrups, Electuaries, Pills,
Trochisces or Lozenges, Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
Unguents, and Oyls, you have
onely so many recommended to
you, as may serve for most uses;
the others of the <hi>Dispensatory</hi> are
omitted, either because they agree
in Vertue with those that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
or are not so congruously
compounded, or are rarely used, or
are dangerous, or useless; or if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
doth require, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by your Physician.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I have taught you
here the best manner of distilling
Simple and Compound Waters, of
preparing Syrups, Pills, Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> what Ingredients are to be
put in first, which afterwards, how
some particular Medicines are to be
reduced into Powders, and how
<pb facs="tcp:94494:6"/>
at last the whole Composition is to
be artificially mixt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I have calculated what
each Medicine will stand you in,
set down exactly the prices of
Herbs and other Simples that are
to be bought of the Herb-women,
the prices current of Drugs and
Physical Seeds that are to be
bought of the Druggists, and of
Spices and dry Fruits that are
vended by the Grocers; all which
being Alphabetically placed in the
latter part of this <hi>Treatise,</hi> you
may at any time have recourse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
whereby you likewise avoid
being imposed upon by the said
Herb-women and Druggists: and
by the same means you may easily
compute, what every Composition
in the <hi>Dispensatory</hi> may amount
unto, giving some small allowance
for garbles and waste, that may
happen by the powdering and
<pb facs="tcp:94494:6"/>
sifting the Ingredients, or by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating
over the Fire, or sticking
to the Pan, Pipkin, or other Utensil
you make use of in preparing some
Compositions.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If want of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
or any other occasion should
perswade you from the preparing
of the hereafter-mentioned Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Compositions at your
own house, you have the prices of
both declared, at which you may
buy them from the <hi>Apotheearies</hi>
ready prepared, to keep a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by you, to be mixt and made
use of according as your Physician
shall judge fit.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you desire to avoid
that trouble also, and do prefer
sending your Physicians Bill to
an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> you may hence ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
compute, what the Medicine is
to be valued at, and what the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary</hi>
deserveth for his pains,
<pb facs="tcp:94494:7"/>
for mixing and bringing it to your
House.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Since every small disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Body puts many into the
humour of sending for an <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,</hi>
who to mimick the Physician,
shall ask you, when you was at
Stool, or whether you are not
oppressed or stuffed at your Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;
feels your Pulse, and then
shall tell you, that you are weak:
and if he findes you hot, he forceth
you to believe you have got a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit:
or if he perceiveth your hand
to be cold, he perswades you that
you have taken cold. This is the
substance of his Theory, on which
he practices so boldly. But if you
are curious to be throughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the whole Body of
Physick, by which the Countrey-<hi>Apothecary</hi>
practiseth, you may
soon gratifie your self in that, by
<pb facs="tcp:94494:7"/>
purchasing a <hi>Treatise</hi> called, <hi>The
Accomplisht Physician, the Honest
Apothecary, and the Skilful Surgeon,</hi>
sold at the Angel in <hi>Duck-lane;</hi>
which having perused from <hi>page</hi>
4 to 14, and from <hi>page</hi> 64 to 73,
will abundantly satisfie you for
your disbursement. If then you
are found to be costive, he sends
you a Clyster at <hi>2 s. 6 d.</hi> price;
which on the same occasion you
may advise your self, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by this <hi>Treatise,</hi> how to
make one for three half pence, or
two pence. If he apprehends your
stomach to be oppressed, he orders
his man to boyl a little <hi>Carduus</hi> in
Water, strain it, and put to it three
or four spoonfuls of rank Oyl of
sweet Almonds, to cause you to
vomit, and carry off a little flegm;
for which an half Crown is an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
rate. Now, instead of this, you
may at a much cheaper price make
<pb facs="tcp:94494:8"/>
your self a Pint or two of <hi>Carduus</hi>-Posset,
and drink it off luke-warm,
to cause the same effect. For your
weakness, he will advise you a
Cordial made out of two or three
musty simple Waters, <hi>Confectio Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kermes,</hi>
and a little Syrup of Gilly-flowers,
for which he expects to
be paid three Shillings and six
Pence; and by the way compute,
what two or three Cordials a day
may amount unto, in three or four
weeks time. What he reckons at
three shillings six pence, you are
taught below, how to prepare a
Cordial Julep for much less. In
case of a Surfeit, three or four pints
of cooling Juleps shall be sent you
every day, at two shillings six
pence, or three shillings the Pint;
which you shall be informed how
to prepare at two pence or three
pence the quart. If he infers from

render you a considerable saver.</p>
            <p>This is the furthest point the
Practicing <hi>Apothecary</hi> can safely
steer, or which you are capable to
apprehend; wherefore you are not
to expect from me instructions for
using the great Remedies, <hi>viz.
Bleeding</hi> and <hi>Purging;</hi> the good
management of which and other
Remedies, doth entirely depend
upon the <hi>Methodus Medendi,</hi> (or
Method of Curing) which two
words do summarily express the
whole <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi> and its
<pb facs="tcp:94494:9"/>
greatest Secret: for, to arrive to
the said Method of Curing, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of Remedies in manner,
order, and time, it's requisite a man
should understand the Nature of
Diseases, their Causes, and the
Parts diseased, unto which the
said Remedies are to be applyed;
all which cannot be understood,
unless you have acquired a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
knowledge of the natural
Constitution of the Parts of the
Body of Man, their Structure, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
Relation, and Connexion to
each other, and their several Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Uses. This Knowledge or
Science is chiefly gained by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>Anatomy,</hi> or <hi>Dissection</hi> of
dead Bodies, and most certainly
is the <hi>Basis</hi> and Ground-work of
the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Physick;</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
finishing of that, is the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodus
Medendi:</hi> For all Factive
and Mechanick Arts consist in these
<pb facs="tcp:94494:9"/>
three particulars. 1. In the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their Subject, which in
our Art is the body of Man in its
natural and preternatural consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
2. In the Instruments or
Means whereby to operate, which
in the said Art are such, whereby
to preserve the Body in its natural
constitution or health, and whereby
to correct and remove its preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
or diseased Constitution,
which are Dyet and Remedies.
3. In the Method or Directory
of Rules, how to use the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
which in <hi>Physick</hi> is called
<hi>Methodus Medendi,</hi> or the Method
of applying the said Means. The
First and Third Particular I have
already spoken to. The Second
is the Means, wherein it is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for a Physician to be not
only knowing, but also experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
as in either of the other: For
what success can be expected from
<pb facs="tcp:94494:10"/>
the Method of applying Remedies,
unless those Remedies are such, as
obtain a Specifick and peculiar
property of correcting or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Cause of each Disease?
A Physician is as little capable to
cure great Diseases with ordinary
Medicines (which notwithstanding
some of the ignorant for want of
due Education pretend to do)
as a Graver is able to cut curious
Figures in Steel, with the ordinary
Tools of a Carver or Stone-cutter;
or a Barber to take off the hair
of your Beard with a Chopping-knife.</p>
            <p>As for those ordinary Medicines,
they are set down in several <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satories,</hi>
among which, that of the
Physicians of <hi>London,</hi> considering
the time it was composed, by far
exceeds all the others. These ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Medicines, it's confessed, being
methodically applied, may by long
<pb facs="tcp:94494:10"/>
continuation remove some slight
Distempers, and some great Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
also, if timely used; but if
confirmed and inveterated, are too
oft found absolutely fruitless. For
what proper Remedy do those
<hi>Dispensatories</hi> contain to cure a
Pulmonick ulcerous <hi>Consumption,</hi>
an inveterate <hi>Scurvey, Dropsie,
Stone, Gout, Fever, Kings-Evil,
Leprosie,</hi> &amp;c. To this a Vulgar
Hackney-Physician shall possibly
answer, That there is no Disease,
be it never so great or dangerous,
but he will <hi>undertake</hi> (which is
well put in) to cure by Method,
and that with ordinary Medicines.
For Example, a Consumption oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by an Ulcer in the Lungs,
he pretends to cure by prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
1. Medicines that shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
or cleanse the Ulcer, by
expelling the matter by <hi>Expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
that is, by coughing and
<pb facs="tcp:94494:11"/>
spitting; and this is performed by
<hi>Ground-Ivy, Speedwel, Hyssop,</hi> and
many other Vulneraries made into
a Syrup, Lohoch, or Decoction.
2. By consolidating Medicines,
that shall close up and skin it with
a <hi>Callus;</hi> such are <hi>Comfrey, Knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grass,
Ladies-Mantle,</hi> and such like,
as you may read in <hi>Chap. 20.</hi> of my
<hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Consumptions.</hi> 3. By
moistening and restoring the solid
and other parts that are consumed
and dried up by the absorbing
heat of an <hi>Hectick Fever.</hi> This
Effect is expected from <hi>Asses Milk,</hi>
which they say, doth cleanse, cool,
moisten, and nourish the consumed
parts. 4. By Fontanels or Issues,
shaving off the Hair of the Head,
and applying Attractive Plaisters
on it; likewise by cramming the
Patient with Conserve and Sugar
of Roses; all which shall serve
to intercept the defluxion of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding
<pb facs="tcp:94494:11"/>
Humours, falling down
from the Brain to the Lungs.
Now when all these means have
been used a very considerable time,
look upon the <hi>Weekly Bills</hi> of
<hi>Mortality,</hi> and you shall soon know
the pretended effects of those
ordinary Medicines.</p>
            <p>In the first place I must agree,
that some of those Indications are
well enough proposed, and the
<hi>Indicata</hi> in respect of the <hi>Materia
Medica</hi> there set down, do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(though seldom) accomplish
a happy Cure. But in the second
place, I must also tell you, that
there is another sort of a <hi>Materia
Medica,</hi> being artificially prepared,
and not according to the Rules of
the slovenish Cookery of <hi>Country-Apothecaries,</hi>
that doth very oft,
and always, if timely and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically
applied, answer the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of the Physician, and the
<pb facs="tcp:94494:12"/>
hopes of the Sick, not only in
Pulmonick Consumptions, but also
in those other Diseases before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
            <p>Touching those <hi>great Medicines,</hi>
it is very fortunate they are not
yet arrived to the knowledge of
the little <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
<hi>Surgeons,</hi> who using them
without Method, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they might do good, yet
for want of capacity in the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative,
would certainly at most
times do great mischiefs with them;
and therefore every Physician
ought to reserve them secret, by
preparing them himself, and when
necessary to be used, to send them
to the Apothecary to be exhibited,
or to give them to his Patients,
with what Directions are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, though the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
by the said great Medicines
<pb facs="tcp:94494:12"/>
is by me here proposed as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
yet I am not to be understood
by that, to exclude the use of
<hi>Apothecaries,</hi> or the Medicines of
the <hi>Dispensatory,</hi> that are to be
prepared by them: for most <hi>schetical</hi>
and moveable, or slight commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Diseases, those ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
are experienced so capable
to remove, that to make use of
great Medicines in those cases,
would seem, as if you laid hold of
a Club to knock down a Louse.</p>
            <p>The second necessary use of the
said ordinary Medicines is, either
to serve the great Medicines for
Vehicles, or to be substituted in
their stead (when some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may countermand their use) so
long, until occasion or opportunity
shall require the aid of the said
great Medicines, and the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
circumstances be abated.</p>
            <p>

Now, Reader, if I finde this

from you, which its real Use, and

Waters, and the manner how to
distil them.</head>
               <p>AMong the vast number of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
simple Waters, none
are more useful, than those four
mentioned below, which may serve
to answer that intention, which
the best of simple Waters are used
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94494:15"/>
for, <hi>viz.</hi> for Cordial Juleps, and
Cordial Potions. What concerns
alterative Waters, they contain so
weak a vertue (as I said afore in
the <hi>Introduction</hi>) that Decoctions,
Infusions, and Juices made, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
drawn from the same altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Simples, are infinitely more
effectual; and therefore when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
doth require the use of
them, may be prescribed, and easily
taught you how to prepare them,
by your <hi>Family-Physician.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Four Simple Waters are,
1. <hi>Baume Water. 2. Black-Cherry
Water. 3. Carduus Benedictus Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
4. Red Poppey Water,</hi> that is,
Water distilled of red Poppey
flowers.</p>
               <p>The Herbs, namely <hi>Baume,</hi> and
<hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> are to be bought
in <hi>Newgate-Market, Stocks-Market,
Gutter-lane,</hi> or <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> of
the Physical Herb-women, by the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94494:15"/>
Basket, the Red Poppey Flowers
by the Peck, Violet Flowers, and
some others are sold by the pint or
quart measure. <hi>Scurvey-grass</hi> is sold
by the Basket, also by the Bushel or
Peck. For most Herbs, if you buy
them by the handful, you must pay
a Groat a dozen; or if you have
occasion for less than a dozen, a
half-penny the handful is the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
rate. The value of twelve
Pence in Herbs or Flowers will
yield three Pints of Water, or
more; in some Herbs it may yield
two Quarts or five Pints: or if
you have not the convenience of
distilling them, you may buy them
from the <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> at a Shilling
the Pint; or if you are onely
mindful to buy them, when your
occasions require, you need pay
but a Penny for the Ounce, being
the common price of almost all
distilled Waters. The common
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94494:16"/>
price of most English Roots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Herb-women is a Groat
for a Pound.</p>

Simple Waters.</head>
                  <p>Put as many of those Herbs
(being separated from the greater
Stalks) or Flowers (pull'd from
their Husks) as will only fill two
Thirds, or at most three Fourth
parts of the body of a Pewter
Alembick, or a Copper Alembick
with a Bucket head, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any Water to the Herbs,
(which too many <hi>Apothecaries</hi> do)
and having closed the head to the
body, by pasting slips of Paper,
of the breadth of an Inch, or a
little more, round about the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
with Starch or Yest; kindle
your fire gradually, and continue
it to a heat so gentle, that your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94494:16"/>
hand may endure it on any part
of the Head; and so you will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still
your Waters without smelling
of being burned, provided you
have put ashes to the thickness of
an Inch and half between the plate
and the body or bottom of your
Pewter Alembick.</p>
                  <p>If you make use of a Copper
Alembick, you must fill the bucket
with cold Water, and assoon as
you finde the Water to be hot in
the said bucket head, you must
tap it off, and fill it up again with
cold Water.</p>
                  <p>The reason why you are not to
fill the body of the Alembick with
Herbs, is, because should you fill
it up, the bottome of the cake of
the Herbs will be dried and burnt,
before the top is half dry or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
off.</p>

Baume and Carduus
Benedictus must be each severally
bruised into a sappy mass in a
stone Mortar, or a <hi>Lignum vitae</hi>
Mortar, and pressed through a
fine Canvas cloath in a small Press.
The fine Canvas cloath for strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
you buy at the Linnen Drapers
at ten pence the yard. The small
Presses you may buy at the Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
at <hi>Hosier-lane</hi> end, next to
<hi>Smithfield,</hi> from three shillings to
six or seven, according to their
bigness; or possibly you may buy
one at second hand big enough
for your use, at the same Shops, for
eighteen pence or less.</p>
                  <p>The reason why you are to
bruise the Walnut-peel, Rue, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94494:18"/>
the other Herbs severally, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you are to have an exact
measure of each of their Juices;
For should you bruise Marigold-leaves,
Baume, and Carduus, of
each the same quantity together,
yet you would not have the same
measure of Juices from them, in
regard one Herb yields far more
Juice than another; though at the
same time I know several <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries,</hi>
to save trouble, do bruise
the foresaid Herbs together, which
notwithstanding must be imputed
an error in the exactness of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<hi>Treacle-Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Observe, that <hi>Apothecaries</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
take the green Walnuts
whole, that is, Nuts and Peel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, before they are quite
ripe, and bruise them in a stone-Mortar
together, in order to the
expressing of the Juice out of
them. Moreover note, that about
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94494:18"/>
fifty Walnuts will go near to yield
a Pint of Juice.</p>
                  <p>2. The Butter-bur, Burdock,
Masterwort, and Angelica-roots
must be fresh taken out of the
ground, and may be bruised to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
into a mash; the Water-Germander-leaves
must be dryed,
stript from their stalks, and beaten
in a Mortar into a course powder;
or they may be used green, and
beaten in a Mortar to a mash, or
shred small with a knife.</p>
                  <p>3. Put all these together with the

juices, and the <hi>Canary Wine,</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

applying round the juncture (or

a Hogs Bladder cut into long slips,
the breadth of two fingers, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94494:19"/>

                  <p>

Take dried Briony-roots, beaten to a

the Herbs being all dried, and the
other Ingredients poudered gross, and
in the same quantity as they are set
down before. Instead of three pints
of Canary, take a quart of the best
<hi>Nants</hi> Brandy. Put them into a
Glass, and let them steep six days in
warm Ashes, then strain the liquor
off, and keep it in a glass Bottle
cork'd up for your use.</p>
                  <p>An half ounce of this Liquor
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94494:27"/>
doth contain more vertue, than
half a pint of the other distilled
Water.</p>
                  <p>What this Liquor or Water will
stand you in, is not difficult to
compute, by what is informed you
before; therefore I shall spare the
pains of summing it up here.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Apothecaries</hi> prices are three

whereby it sweeteneth the humors,
by allaying those gnawing Salts
that prey on the Lungs. Now in

part of their unctuous or glutinous

a meer Elementary Water. The

                  <p>The Marshmallow-roots, by scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
with a knife, must be freed
from those strings that hang about
them; likewise their hard cordy
substance must be taken away
from them; then wash them well,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94494:30"/>
and bruise them in the Mortar.
Also wash the Grass-roots and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparagus-roots,
and bruise them;
scrape off the black outside from
the Liquoris, and bruise it into
strings, or rasp it; wash the Herbs
clean, for cleanliness in preparing
of Medicines is wholsome, and no
less commendable than it is in
Cookery.</p>
                  <p>First then put into your Pipkin
(being placed on a clear fire, and
containing three quarts of water)
the Marshmallow, Asparagus, and
Grass-roots, because they require
longest boiling; a while after put
in the Cicers, and not long after
that put in the Herbs, being shred;
the next you must put in, are the
Seeds, Liquoris, and Raisins: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sufficiently boil'd, strain and
press the Liquor out, and then
clarifie it. The manner how to
clarifie Decoctions and Apozemes,

In the preparation of the Syrup
of <hi>Marshmallows,</hi> the manner of
clarifying Decoctions was referred
to the latter end of this Chapter,
which is thus: Having strained
your Decoction (being only warm,
not hot) through a canvas or
woollen Strainer, pour about a
pint thereof into a Bafon, wherein
you have put before two whites of
Eggs, beaten with a Rod of small
twigs, and their shells crusht with
your hands: mix them well together
by stirring them with a spoon, or
rather beating them into a froth
with the foresaid Rod of twigs;
then put in another pint of the
Decoction, and mix it as before.
This done, set it over the fire, and
let it boil a little until you see a
scum a top; then take it off, and let
it cool a little, and then strain it,
and let it run through without
squeezing or pressing it.</p>

                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:94494:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> That two Whites of Eggs,
with their Shells, are sufficient for
clarifying a quart or three pints of
Decoction.</p>
                  <p>The manner of clarifying Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zems
is only thus: Having clarified
the Decoction as before is set down,
you heat it again, and when it
beginneth to boil, mix the Syrup
with it, and let it continue on the
fire until it casts up a scum, then
strain it twice or thrice, being half
grown cold.</p>

                  <p>1. The white Sugar, the Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candy,
and <hi>Penide</hi> Sugar, must be
pounded and sifted.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Penide</hi> Sugar is prepared
thus: Dissolve the best <hi>Bahi</hi> Sugar
in water over a gentle fire; then
clarifie it with Whites of Eggs,
in manner as hath been told you;
next strain it through a cloath,
and let it stand again over a gentle
fire, and boil away, until it
comes to such a bodie that it will
stick to your Teeth; then being
almost cooled, pour it on a Marble
Stone, being a little anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

over with Oyl of sweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
keeping it together in a

fingers, being dusted over with a
little Starch-flour. When it is
grown almost quite cold, and ropie,
take it up with a steel fork, to make
it hang in ropes, which with your
hand, being dusted with fine flour,
you may twine into what shape
you please. This being so prepared,
is called <hi>Penide</hi> Sugar.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Orris-roots</hi> must be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and sifted; likewise the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoris
powdered in this manner.
Take dried Liquoris, scrape off the
brown with a knife, round about;
then cut it into small bits with a
knife that is made of the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
which Shoemakers knives are
made of. These put into a brass
Mortar, and beat into powder.</p>
                  <p>

Druggists at a very small rate, which
you may read in the Catalogue of
Prices belonging to this Treatise.</p>
                  <p>4. The Starch-flour must be
gently rubbed into a powder in a
Mortar; and then mix all of them
together in the same Mortar, by
stirring the Pestil round about;
then pour to it as much mucilage of
Gum-dragant as will suffice to bring
the Powders into a Paste, and beat it
well together. The Paste being rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

when they are to be eaten buttered.</p>

dried, put into a brass Mortar, whose

hotter than your hand can endure,

hole through it for the Pestle to
pass, beat the Gum to powder, and
sift it; what is unsifted put into
the Mortar again, which if it be not
hot enough, you must heat again
in manner as hath been told you.
Lastly observe, that you must put in
a fourth part more into the Mortar,
than is set down in the Prescription;
because at least a fourth part will
waste in the powdering.</p>

                  <head>The manner of preparing.</head>
                  <p>The Preparation of Pearl, Crabs
eyes, red Coral, Bezoar, and Crabs
claws, is only thus: You must first
reduce them into a fine powder,
and sift them. Afterwards grinde
them into a most subtil and smooth
powder or dust upon a Marble,
or Porphyr stone, with a Muller,
dropping now and then a few drops
of Rose-water into the powder, to
keep it from dispersing or flying up.
The Harts-horn must be grated, and
afterwards beaten in a brass Mortar
into a fine powder, and sifted.
The white Amber, that is, the
lightest yellow, must be beaten and
ground with a Pestle into a subtil
powder, and sifted by it self. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
mix all the powders well in
the Mortar, by stirring and moving
them together with the Pestle.</p>

lower rate, for the poorer sort; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94494:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for what I know, may prove more
effectual: thus, Instead of Oriental
Pearl, take Occidental; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
the finest sort of Mother of
Pearl doth exceed either; that is,
if prepared as it ought to be. In
lieu of Oriental Bezoar, take Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental;
which being much chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
doth not so much encourage
fraudulent people to counterfeit
them: and therefore in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
certain Occidental Bezoar
may justly be preferred before the
uncertain Oriental. But what if
the Bezoar be wholly left out, and
double the proportion of Pearl
that's put in, where is the damage?

                  <p>2. I must shew you how to

a pound and half of the best Cassia
in Canes, crush them into pieces,
that you may take out all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
together with the Grains,
which put into a hair Sieve, and
hold it over the steem of warm

have been boil'd, or over the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
(being warm) which was
prepared for the <hi>Lenitive Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
so that the steem thereof pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
through the Sieve, may moisten
and dissolve the marrow of the
Cassia. While this is doing, you
must with the back of a spoon
stir and press the said marrow
through the Sieve, and gently with
the hollow of your spoon take it
off on the other side; and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to do, until all the marrow
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94494:46"/>
is passed through. Moreover, if
your Cassia be very dry, you may
moisten it a little with the warm
Decoction, that it may pass the
easier. On the other hand, if the
pulp of the Cassia be too moist or
liquid when it is passed, you must
put it on a Tin Plate, or a flat
earthen glased Pan, and set it over
a Chafing-dish to dry the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
moisture from it, until it come
to the thickness of an <hi>Electuary.</hi>
About a quarter of a pound of
good Cassia, or somewhat more, in
Canes, is usually found to yield an

of <hi>Tamarinds</hi> into a Mortar,
and pour to it as much warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as will but just soften it, and
a little dissolve it; for otherwise
they being sticking and glewie,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94494:47"/>
the pulp will not pass through the
Sieve. Then with the Pestle gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
move and stir the <hi>Tamarinds</hi>
about, that the warm water may
incorporate with them. This so
done, put the Mass into a Sieve,
and press the pulp through in the
same manner as hath been taught

                  <p>5. The manner of preparing Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
of <hi>Violets.</hi> Take two ounces of
the juice of Violets, and as much
Violet-water, therein dissolve one
pound of white Sugar. Boil them
in a Preserving-pan over a Chafing-dish
of Charcoal, until they come
to a just thickness; which you shall
know by these several trials: 1. By
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94494:47"/>
dropping a drop off the point of a
Knife, or steel Slice on a Plate, and
let it grow cold: if it prove hard
enough, so that you may take it
off the Plate without sticking, it
is boil'd enough. 2. By taking
some of it on the point of a knife,
and let it drop into the Pan again;
which if it be enough, it will drop
a top of the surface, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
raised on it like a knob. 3. By
letting a little cool on the point of
a knife, and then see whether it be
hard enough.</p>
                  <p>Lastly observe, while the Violet-juice,
Water, and Sugar are boiling,
you must oft stir it with a steel
Slice, or long-handled spoon or
knife, to prevent it from burning
at the bottom.</p>

                  <p>When your Sugar of Roses or
Violets is taken off from the Fire,
and hath stood a little for to cool,
put it on a clean smooth Marble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
whereon you must have
dusted a little fine Flour, by tying
it up in a fine rag; and then beating
the said rag all over the stone (this
being done, to prevent the sticking
of the Lozenges to the Stone)
afterwards take a small Rolling-pin,
such as is used for Paste, and dust
it likewise over with fine Flour:
with this Rolling-pin smooth the
top of the Sugar, being almost
grown cold; then with a Knife cut
it into Lozenges of such shape and
bigness you fancie best.</p>

chargeable to be prepared; and
when it is prepared, signifies no

volatile Salts and Spirits of those
Spices being united with the Spirits
of the <hi>Brandy,</hi> do not only render
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94494:51"/>
them more potent to extract the
virtue of the other Simples, but also
qualifie them through their subtile
particles, to maturate and digest
the gross impure Sulphurs of those

become more milde, and less offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive

                  <p>In imitation of this Unguent,
<hi>Felix Wurtz</hi> prepared his brown
Oyntment, that is so much famed
among most forreign Surgeons,
thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:94494:58"/>
1. Take Ground-Ivie, Speedwell,
and Figwort, of each one handful;
being bruised in a Mortar, put them
into a glass Retort-Receiver, and
pour on them as much sharp Vinegar
as will cover them, and two inches
over; let them stand in digestion in
the Sun in the Summer, or in warm
water in the Winter, for seven days;
then strain and press the Vinegar
hard from them.</p>
                  <p>2. Take of the best green Coppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras
two pound, put it into a thick
blackish earthen Melting-pipkin, of
no greater bigness than will just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Vitriol. This place between
Bricks laid so as to make a square
Tower, about two inches larger than
the Pipkin, and two inches higher.
Fill this kind of open Furnace with
Charcoal up to the top, and kindle it
gradually, which in less than half an
hour will make the Pipkin red-hot;
continue this heat until the Copperas
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94494:58"/>
be calcined, or burned into a deep
red. Then take out the Pipkin, and
being grown cold, break it, and take
out the red Copperas, or Colchothar,
which beat to powder, and put into a
new Pipkin; pour on it one quart of
River or Spring-water, and one pint
of Vinegar; boil them until half be
consumed away; then after it is setled
pour off the tinctured Liquor into
a flat earthen pan: This done, pour
another quart of Spring-water upon
the same red Vitriol; boil it away
half, and after it is setled, pour off
the tinctured Liquor to the other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
in the earthen pan; this repeat
with fresh water, until the red Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras
will colour the water no longer.
Place the earthen pan between two
Bricks set edge-wise, and kindle a
very moderate fire under it, and let
the water evaporate, or dry away,
until the red Vitriol that was dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the said water, be left dry in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94494:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the bottom of the pan. This red dried
Vitriol put into a new Pipkin, and
calcine or burn it over again, as you
did at first; that put in into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pipkin, and pour fresh water on
it, and boil it as you did before, to
extract the tincture, or dissolve the
purest of the red Vitriol; then pour
it off into your earthen pan, and pour
more fresh water on the red Vitriol
or Copperas in the Pipkin, and boil it
to extract more of the tincture: thus
continue until all is extracted, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the remaining dregs on the
bottom; the tinctured Liquors eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
again to a driness, and then
calcine or burn the red Copperas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
on the bottom a third time,
and extract and evaporate it over
again, in the same manner as before;
which done, then the Copperas is
prepared.</p>
                  <p>3. Take Verdigriese one ounce and
half, powder it and put it into a glass;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94494:59"/>
pour on it half a pint of sharp distill'd
Vinegar; let it stand in the Sun four
or five days, or 24 hours in warm
water; then pour off the Vinegar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tinctured green, and evaporate it
in an earthen pan, until it be dry.</p>
                  <p>The proportion of these prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Ingredients for to make the
foresaid <hi>Brown Oyntment,</hi> is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
                  <p>Take of the above-mentioned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Copperas powdered, two ounces;
of the prepared Verdigriese, one ounce
and a quarter; clarified Honey, six
ounces; of the Vinegar that was
pressed from the Herbs, three ounces;
of the Flegm of Vitriol, two ounces:
boil them to the thickness of an
Oyntment, in the same manner as was
told you in the preparation of the
<hi>Unguentum Aegyptiacum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Brown Oyntment, as it is
here described, the preparation is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94494:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
very tedious and troublesome;
which you may make shorter, thus:
<hi>Calcine the Vitriol six hours, then
powder it, and extract the tincture
with three quarts of water, and one
pint of sharp Vinegar; evaporate it,
and then it is sufficiently prepared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Verdigriese must be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as it is set down before.</p>
                  <p>The Herbs need not be extracted
with Vinegar; only press out their
juices, and mix them with the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Verdigriese.</p>
                  <p>The Honey need not be clarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
only take off the scum, as it is
boiling with the juices; then put
in the other Ingredients, according
as you have been informed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>But far beyond this, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
prescribed an Oyntment,
that in malignant or sordid Ulcers,
Joynt-waters, Fistula's, and other
desperate cases, doth the greatest
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94494:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Effects imaginable; which I here
impart to you.</p>
                  <p>Take of the Vitriol of <hi>Venus,</hi> of
the Vitriol of <hi>Mars,</hi> of each half an
ounce; Sugar of Lead, two drams;
Honey boiled up to a consistency, three
ounces and half; Mithridate half an
ounce; mix them together in the
Mortar, without putting them over
the fire. If your Oyntment happen to
be too thick, either by over-boiling
the Honey, or by driness of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
drying the Oyntment after it is
made, you may soften it with a little
Honey of Roses, or rather Iuice of
Celandine.</p>
