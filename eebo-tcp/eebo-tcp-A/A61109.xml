            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and converse with God,
and therefore; in a tacit sense
thereof, is continually reaching
and aspiring after it. But Lust and Pride
having blinded its Eye, it is apt to affect
and seek it in fond and fantastick ways.
Whereas good men are (as <hi>Antoninus</hi>

hot and vigorous impressions of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and have verily thought (as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Heathens by their Prophets) that
they are scarce ever <hi>full of God,</hi> till they
are half beside themselves. And therefore
the Lives of the <hi>Romish</hi> Saints are stuffed
<pb facs="tcp:41215:3"/>
out with perpetual Stories of such things
as these, which do but render them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In confidence of this conceit, such num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of <hi>Devoto's</hi> in all Times have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Enthusiasm and extraordinary il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse

Teachings of the Gospel, as those did the
more weak and cloudy Instructions of the
Law; that the Minds of Holy Men should
conceive (like the Virgin <hi>Mary)</hi> by the
sole <hi>overshadowings of the Holy Ghost,</hi>
without any Assistances from Man or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Literature. That Men should be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torized
and assisted to the due performance
<pb facs="tcp:41215:3"/>
of the Duties of publick Preaching and
Praying by the incitements of God upon
the place. That God was about no new
Work, but his Secrets were still made known
unto the <hi>Faithful.</hi> That the mighty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and propensions upon the spirits of
the <hi>Faithful,</hi> was an interpretative Voice
from Heaven, a kind of <hi>Bath-Col</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

Dispensations more dark and aenigmatical.
Whence it came to pass that every morbid
heat of Passion and blind Zeal was chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
by the name of an <hi>Ignis sacer,</hi> the
sacred impress and discovery of the Holy
Ghost, and every crazy Fancy and Dream
dub'd a Prophetick Vision.</p>
            <p>Now as Storms and Tempests at Sea,
though they prove the Evils of many a
private man, yet are the good things of
Catholick Nature, because serving as a
kind of natural Exercise to keep that vast
Body of Waters from putrefaction: Thus
howsoever the bold Pretences to Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Prophecy, and a greater intimacy with
the Divine Spirit, proved the great Evils
of those particular Times, causing many
(weaker vessels especially) to <hi>make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
of Conscience</hi> and <hi>a sound Mind,</hi>
and betrayed them to gross and shameful
Notions in Religion and Policy; yet to the
Church of God in general this hath proved

secure the Person that can do more then
believe, from being easily abused by such
shining Vanities as any pretended Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasms
make a proffer of. So that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Undertaking to lay forth the impostures
wrapt up in this most famo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Frenzies.</p>
            <p>These Considerations would easily have
perswaded me to have spared the Reader

saw so great an affinity between the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

upon both would (like both the

feet) derive a mutual strength and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
upon each other; and that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
which are the issues of an hot head
and disturbed imagination, are but the one
half of those which abuse the Faith of the
People: I considered withal that <hi>Prophecy</hi>
is the most obstinate piece of Enthusiasm,
having our innate Curiosity and an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
as great as <hi>Prodigies</hi> to make it
considerable. Besides, while good Laws are
the best Security of the Peace, sober Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
laid in the Minds of the People are
the best Security of the Laws.</p>

They torture mens minds with infinite anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties,
and lay upon their thoughts the Evils
of an Age to lament at once. They encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them in very evil purposes, by the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
they give them of success. They keep
men from possessing themselves in peace by
a secure repose on the wisdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God. They tempt them to a neglect
of those faithful and acknowledged Rules of
life, <hi>Scripture, and the Maxims of Reason,</hi>
to attend to measures fantastical and never

                  </gap>, and the like,

Soothsayers, Necromancers, Interpreters
of Dreams and Prodigies, Diviners by the
Smoke, the Exta, the Incense on the Altar,
by a Staff, the chirping of Birds,</hi> all of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
occurrence in their Writings, are a

Nations were so mad upon Divination, that

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>they are full of the East</hi>
seems used proverbially by the Prophet, to
set forth that mighty passion with which the
<hi>Iews</hi> were carried after Divination and the
knowledg of Futurities. And with how
easie a Faith the <hi>Iews</hi> used to meet any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to Prophecy, though calling them
(to the most open defiance of Reason and
Religion) Idolatry, the Writings of the
Old Testament will sufficiently resolve us.
And Christians (though these Vulgar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
have been proved, by an infinite
Experience, a dead catch, devoid of the
life of truth and perspicuity) stoop as greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to them, when ever thrown before them,
as if they were all Oracle. For they easily
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41215:17"/>
believe no man to be so projectedly Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical,
as to intitle God to the Visions of
his own brain: not considering that the
spirit of heated Melancholy may inspire
these Prophets, and abuse them with some
vigorous impressions as much as they do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men.</p>
               <p>Now it cannot but seem strange to our
first thoughts, that while all other Sects
and impostures suited to the present <hi>gusto</hi> of
the people, have had their peculiar times
and places of acceptance, and the <hi>Wheel of
Fortune</hi> (as it is called) hath gone over them
all and crush'd them in the dust, Enthusiasts
and pretences to Prophecy should prove an
obstinate cheat which all Ages and Nations
have been thus gull'd withal; especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that the hiding of Events from us
is so great a security to the quiet of our
minds, and <hi>felicities</hi> are always greater, and
Evils (because they then afflict us but once)
the lighter, which do surprize us. This so
strange and catholick a Vanity must deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our Inquiries after some catholick and
immutable Causes in humane Nature which
may give us some probable account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
They are (I conceive) especially these
three:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>A catholick presumption of the singular
readiness of God to communicate with Man,
especially if a more refined person,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>and separate from all
the ways of the people</hi> (as the Masters say a
Prophet must be.) This perswasion may
grow either from a kind of tacit sense in the
Soul that it was made for converse with
God, to refer to him, to derive light and
law from him. A remembrance of which
birthright of the Soul remained a while in
the more simple and innocent years of the
World, in that frequent intercourse between
God and Man, by the mission of Angels,
vouchsafing of divine Visions and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
immediate Oracles, and that administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of civil affairs in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Kingdom
by the immediate direction of God himself.
Or else (which is more explicable) it might
possibly arise from a fantastical measure of
goodness in God. Men have thought it
could not stand with the goodness of God
to suppose him reserved, and to leave them
in the dark in some very doubtful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
circumstances of life: and therefore
<hi>si Dii sint, divinatio est</hi> was thought by <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and others a very natural consequence.
And a late Writer, to prove Prophecy not
yet ceased, placeth this in the front of his
<hi>demonstrations</hi> (so he calls them) <hi>the eternal
duration of the Divine Goodness and Bounty;</hi>
which will oblige him (saith he) to as free a
communication of this prophetick light
now, as in the years of old: and therefore

Divination, an unwearied pursuit of
this knowledg, in Oracles, in Omens, in
Prophecies, in Prodigies, in Auguries, in the
Signs of Heaven, in the Guts of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and the like; and so far befooled them
that they oft preferred the ravings of a
mad-man, the chirpings of a Bird, the babble
of an Astrologer, and the Dreams of an old
woman, to greater veneration then <hi>the words
of the wise;</hi> and made the smoke of his
house appear a better Oracle then the man
of counsel that dwelt in it. And an impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the ignorance of things to come,
fooled the <hi>Iews</hi> as well as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> out
of their Reason and Religion both at once,
tempting them to<note n="g" place="margin">Hos. 4. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>ask counsel at their
stocks,</hi> and to seek to <hi>their Staff to declare</hi>
futurities <hi>unto them.</hi> Amongst our selves a
like affection for this knowledg betrays so
many men to such Opinions of Astrologers,
Fortune-tellers, the predictions of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts,
and men upon a death-bed. Look as
those gross vapors, which, while he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41215:19"/>
as soon as they mount the Heavens, and
carry light and fire with them, draw the eyes
of men upon them, and are thought Divine
presages. Thus those persons, whose gross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and dulness in all matters referring to
Religion, Learning or common life, rendred
them to the neglect or pity of sober men, as
soon as that black humor in them takes fire,
and the men seem to speak from Heaven,
and to carry a prophetick light with them,
they presently become considerable, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
the common Subjects of Discourse,
their Prophecies are studied more then the
Bible, and men wonder to see how little
those fools-bolts mist of the mark they were
level'd unto.</p>
               <p>Now the teeth of men have thus water'd
for this <hi>forbidden fruit,</hi> the knowledg of
things to come, partly from a weakness and
childishness of temper whereby they cannot
relish and digest the <hi>strong meat</hi> of substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Doctrine and solid argument; partly
from some present uneasiness of condition,
the duration whereof looks like an Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to their short spirits, while they know
no end thereof; partly in a vain hope that
according as a good or an evil is prophesied
concerning them, so their diligence may be

was served by such persons as God found
qualified, generally with wisdom, always
with piety. And therefore our Savior tells

of meriting, by such devout singularities,
the highest favors and intimacies with God,
cannot easily fail of intoxicating, weaker
heads especially, with the conceit of some
extraordinary visions and prophetick inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
Accordingly such swarms of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and rapturists have flown out of those

<hi>Constance, Anno</hi> 1415. was conven'd (as
<note n="p" place="margin">Tract. de Probat. Spir.</note>
                  <hi>Gerson</hi> tells us) especially to determine
which should pass for Canonical and
which for Apocryphal prophets in that
Church: and the many gross fallacies put,
even upon wise men, by such frequent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionists,

Christian zeal advise against the spreading
infection of those more <hi>solemn and demu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
frenzies,</hi> Visions and pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.
Nor perhaps will that term be
thought a bolt let fly without aim, if the
Reader consider further how frequent such
prophetick visions and illapses are with these
persons; Revelations usually are as familiar
with them as Arguments with other men,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41215:27"/>
those three<note n="q" place="margin">

God almost every day: and the Visions of
any one of them may compare numbers with
all that the prophetick writings make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

a great jealousy that the most of them were
but the visions of a disturbed Fancy, and
the spurious issues of that inchanting humor
of Melancholy which will present as many
delusive images to a man as a conjurers glass.
And perhaps, therefore did the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
record the year and the month when
they received the divine illapses, that so
their Visions and Prophecies might not be
thought the fatal and therefore frequent
workings of that black humor in them,

               <p>If we proceed next to make search into

thought it sufficiently to reproach the faith
of all the Ethnick Prophecies and Oracles,
that they were delivered by persons notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for nothing but the grossness of their

opposed that very many modern Prophets
have been persons of unstained lives, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whose piety and prophecy reflected
a mutual grace upon each other. To which
I answer, That we scarce ever met with a
false prophet in<note n="a" place="margin">Mic. 3. 5. 11. Ezec. 13. 22. 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3. Mat. 7. 15.</note> Scripture but challenged

croke and make a noise, so they live in the

was then, so it is generally now. <hi>Paracelsus</hi>

as that, consisting in some pathetical

the innocent usages of men, not in a profound

of these persons were so really religious as it
is pretended, I cannot weaken their title to
Prophecy by this first Consideration, but
may possibly effect it by some that shall
succeed.</p>

                  <hi>God had now removed from his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,

them to speak to those which counsu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But this rather shews the knot
then unties it. The true Reason of this
change of language was (I conceive) either
because men began to suspect that where
there was so much of man appearing in the
Oracle there could not be much of God, and
that Inspiration is too hot and active a thing
to move the sober and cool pace of a Poem:
or else because the tempers of men were
grown more sedate, their minds &amp; discourses
not so turgent and ecstatical as heretofore;
or because he saw the clouds began to break,
and God addrest him to men in more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and familiar ways, and therefore the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
(who would never be out of fashion)
came nearer to the minds of men, and laid
aside the state and solemnity he formerly
spake to them with. Or perhaps because
the true Oracles of God, delivered in more
easie and neglected language, began to lie
more exposed to the common view, and he
would not have his to differ from them, but
to imitate them. There is that coolness and
curiousness in a Verse, which speaks it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unsuitable to the vehemence and serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Prophetick Spirit. It useth to
beget transports of mind, which cannot bear
the slowness and nicety of a Poem: for, as
common and quotidian thoughts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath

Whereas the motions of the Prophetick

and such as the slow feet of a Verse
cannot hold pace withal. And as for the
Poetry in those Books, it is rathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in them, they are generally so mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
couch'd that none of the learned have
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41215:32"/>
been able yet to make any certain report of
them. And therefore, upon this score, I
should make no great doubt to throw out
the vast rabble of rhyming, clinching, vers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prophets, as persons that tell the worst
lies in the best maner.</p>
               <p>Another thing which proclaims the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of these Vulgar Prophecies, is, <hi>the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of time with which they are generally
delivered:</hi> For either they prefix no time
at all, or a very long period thereof to be
accomplish'd in; whereby they can minister
neither to the honor of God nor the good
of man. For they can give no testimony to
his Providence or Prescience, because they
will be thought to be fulfilled by chance, or
the Prophecy (because long ago delivered)
will be forgotten, and the Event, when it
comes, be thought to have stood in no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all to the Prophecy; and therefore
it may perhaps, by the singularity thereof,
beget wonder in men, but not piety. Nor
can any man be warned by them to avoid an
Evil, which may come (for ought he knows)
not till his head be laid; nor can they give
check to the sins of the time, for men will
be ready to say, like the scorners in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 12. 22.</note>
                  <hi>The days are prolonged, and every Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
faileth.</hi> Nor (if the Prophecy fail) shall
the Prophet be alive to bear the shame of
his impostures. The condition of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41215:33"/>
in sacred Writ, which take Ages to
be accomplish'd in, is quite diffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ure, and
therefore fall under the daily notices of men;
so that when the Events foretold come to
pass, they may readily be compared with
the Prophecies; which, the more ancient
date they bear, the more wonderful will
they appear when accomplish'd, and the
more full reports will they make of their
divine Original, and of the Scripture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are found. For there is nothing doth
so seal the Faith of the divine Inspiration of
Scripture, as the various Predictions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

But these Vulgar Prophecies are either not
delivered to writing at all, or the writings
forgotten, or look'd into but by a few curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
persons, and therefore easily altered and
varied (as the Prophecies of <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet the Prophecies of a more

they were pregnant with,<note n="m" place="margin">

men grew so wicked as to deride the patience

of God, and to think they lived the longer

               <p>From all this it appears, in a great degree
of probability, that the Father of Lies gave
being to very many of these spurious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
that by these false he might derive
a suspicion upon the true ones, or abuse the
minds of men with vain hopes, panick fears,
or curious impertinences. And will any man,
that owns his Savior for his Prophet, receive
the Devil for his Oracle? or when he is sick
of things present, go to <hi>the God of Ekron</hi> (by

for quiet and resolution? Shall we value our

Of these, it will suffice to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
purpose briefly to point to some few,
which the Ages, to which Prophecy was
promised, seem to have made the greatest
reckoning of.</p>
               <p>As (1.) <hi>The discovery of some present
matter, evidently out of the compass of all
humane knowledg:</hi> as the secrets of the
heart, the counsels of the bed-chamber,
matters done at distance and with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
secrecy, and the like. Such wonderful
discoveries were of<note n="x" place="margin">Joh. 4. 17, 18, 19. 1 Cor. 14. 25.</note> great consideration with
the people (in that time to which God had
promised Prophecy) to assure the divine
Mission of the Prophets: accordingly our
Savior was<note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 21. 2. Luk. 22. 12, 13 11. 17. 24. 38.</note> frequent in the use of such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Signs, and so were the<note n="z" place="margin">2 King. 6. 12. 2 Sam. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12.</note> other Prophets
it is likely: and therefore the <hi>Iews,</hi> which
looked upon our Savior but as a Mock-Prophet,
required him to a discovery of a
<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 22. 64.</note>Mock-Secret, the person who smote him
on the face while he was blindfolded; the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41215:36"/>

to fall out within the compass of a few

from Heaven to him, before witnesses,</hi> was
another Sign of a Prophet<note n="s" place="margin">Psa. 99. 6, 7. Job 38. 1. Exod. 24. 16.</note> in ancient times;
especially before the building of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle:
but when Prophecy became more
common, God chose to speak to holy men
<note n="t" place="margin">Num. 12. 6.</note>by Dreams and Visions: and perhaps the
ceasing of that more usual way of divine
Manifestation under the second Temple,

might occasion some to think he might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
return to the more ancient way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing

assigns this as the Characteristick note be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

These were some of those more general
signs which gave testimony to the Divine
Mission of a Prophet: but besides these,
there were also frequently added some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
signs of the truth of this or that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinay
prediction; especially if of some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of greater import, of the truth whereof it

God, and therefore the Disciples, when our
Savior had foretold an Event so great, as the
destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Temple,
demanded of him a sign both of the truth
and time of the accomplishment of that
Prophecy.<note n="a" place="margin">Luke 21. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Master when shall these things
be, and what shall be the sign when all these
things shall come to pass?</hi> These particular
and almost present signs, gave assurance
that the Prophet did not deliver conjectures
but Prophecies, and the doubling thus of
his Prophecy was a sign that the thing was
certain with God, and not foretold condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
onely, (as judgments and blessings
often were) and that the agreement between
the Prediction and the Event when coming
to pass, was not a chance but a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
So that these were more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the signs of the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as the other
six of the <hi>Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all this, it seems more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41215:38"/>
that all true Prophets came distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by some divine sign, although it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not now from Scripture, what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
sign it was which gave credit to each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
therein mentioned; and that anciently
Men were wiser then to let every prophecy
pass currant, as soon as ever it had the image
of the King of heaven stampt upon it, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
the face of an inspiration from God.
Men then understood Prophecy, upon
many accounts, too much exposed to suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of imposture to be credited upon the
single testimony of every zealous pretender
thereunto: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and therefore all Prophets
though they came not recommended by
equal testimony (the occasions they were
to serve not being of equal moment) yet
still with what might suffice to place their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Mission beyond a question. Some were
attested by Wonders, some by signs, some
by both. If then (to apply all this to the
occasion) Men would once be so advised
as to demand some such divine sign as used
heretofore to credit the Prophetick functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these pretended Prophets, they would
certainly all sneak away like Juglers when
called to shew a Miracle. What have they
generally beyond Ordinary besides ignorance
and confidence? What Miracle or Sign doth
God bear witness to their <hi rend="sup">b</hi> Mission by?
what have all the great <hi>Swelling words</hi> of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41215:39"/>
Enthusiasts been at last delivered of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the crude air of some flatulent imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?
have they, after all the noise they
have made, blest the world with the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of any useful secret in Philosophy or
Divinity? are not Scripture prophecies as
dark, diseases as desperate, nature vail'd
as much now as in former Ages? do not all
their books (like the barren fig-tree) bear
<hi>leaves only,</hi> a few rampant Metaphors, and
some higher straines of prophetick Scripture,
jumbled together like the images of a
dream? shall we then appear so unworthy
of the title we carry as to think a few exsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
looks and Scripture phrases sufficient to
intitle a man to the Opinion of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>a Master of light?</hi> as the <hi>Iews</hi> use to stile
a Prophet: It is not to be imagined that
God would send Prophecy into the world,
and not have it regarded, or that it can be
regarded, if it come attended with nothing
whereby it can be known. When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
had such an extraordinary measure of
the Spirit, there was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>a manifestation of the Spirit;</hi> as the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Measure of the Spirit then poured
out gave<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 3. 2.</note> testimony to the Gospel, so the
mighty signs and wonders which attended it
gave testimony to the Spirit.</p>
               <p>To all this, I know, it will be opposed
that many of these modern Prophets come
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41215:39"/>
attended with signs sufficent to the man who
is of an humble and teachable temper, whom
alone God seeks to satisfie: <hi>viz.</hi> these four,
<hi>Eminent Sanctity. A very liberal and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
gift of Prayer. The mighty energy and
impression of their Visions and Prophecies.
The accomplishment of very many of their
Predictions.</hi> To all which I shall return a
few words.</p>
               <p>First, We are told that they are persons
of <hi>very eminent Sanctity,</hi> that are wholy
abstract from the pleasures and honors of this
world, and have no fleshly relishes appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in them, and therefore 'tis most unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they would deceive others or should
be deceived themselves by a false Prophecy.
To which I answer, There is nothing more
misjudged then Sanctity, 'tis too common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thought to stand <hi>in some more solemn
looks at a Sacrament, in visiting of an holy
shrine, in some extatical devotions, in the use
of some interpreting garbs, faces and Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
in caressing of Christ by some pretty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
in declaiming with much zeal against
some odious names, heresie, Antichrist and
Superstition, in carrying it very morosely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
men of a different form from ones
self, in some severer disciplines and neglects
of the body:</hi> and therefore 'tis unsafe trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our faith with a prophecy upon a report
of the sanctity of the Prophet. Besides, no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41215:40"/>
men more subject to such delusions, then men
of devout affections, if of strong fancies,
impressive tempers, and weak intell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, their words (like arrows point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

impression upon the hearts of the hearers,
the Souls of men become half unbodyed,

make the Understanding more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant,

(then much in use) to the special assistance

Only care must be had, that this heat and
zeal (like the flame at <hi>Pentecost)</hi> aspire and
mount upward, but without firing the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
head, and making him of too hot and
firy a temper to bear any confinement of
Opinion or practice, by Scripture, laws or
the Reasons of wise men. I have in all this
designed only the disparagement of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
imaginations of those men, which
(like the heathens of old) look upon heat
and noise, words full of charms thrown out
without method or measure upon the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,

Whereas all these things, howsoever, like
Meteors, they carry an heavenly appearance
in the eie of ignorance, we have found of
a more common and base Extraction. Nor
is the mighty power they may have over
the Spirits of others, any argument to the
contrary; all fluent language, feathered
with soft and delicate phrases, and pointed

indeed, <hi>that is, makes it self known to the

he there endeavours to build up by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

not but the divine illapses made a very deep

came attended with such light and evidence
as chased away all shadow of scruple about
their divine Original, yet I think to assert

by any divine Sign attending the delivery
of them. In Answer hereunto, I return,
(1.) <hi>Meer prudential Conjectures after the

in vulgar Opinion:</hi> the common sort of
people being apt to invest every thing that

heretofore, and so shall be again</hi> in after

a loose &amp; conjectural Conclusion built upon
an observation that Bodies Politick, as well
as Natural, have their decays and years of
dotage, and that the deepest dye of any
worldly felicity would in time languish and
change color. (3.) <hi>A great part of these
Prophecies are meer impostures, and contrived
after the Event, by some idle heads.</hi> For it is
seldom that we hear of them, till the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
related in them are past; and then these
Prophets, having the Event before them to
take measure of, make their Prophecy to fit
it exactly, both in substance and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that so there might be the less suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41215:50"/>
that they saw things to come (like the
man but half cured of his blindness) onely
in rude generals, and by the heavy Eye of
humane prudence. Whereas there cannot
be a greater assurance of sophistry in a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
then an over-busie and critical enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration
of Events therein. For Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
should deliver the general substance or
some one great circumstance of an Event so
distinctly that they be not thought loose
conjectures, but as to the circumstances of
less remark, they should be wholy silent,
that they be not suspected onely disguized
Histories when once they are fulfilled. For
this Reason perhaps the Divine Prophecies
come forth (like the pillar in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
partly cloud and partly fire, cloudy and
obscure as to the lesser circumstances, but
bright and clear enough as to the substance
of Events foretold. Whereas these Vulgar
Prophecies either stay in loose Generals, and
like a sack are so contrived that they may
be clapt upon any person, but perfectly fit
none; or else are most industriously particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and scarce omit a circumstance. Thus the

to diabolical efficiency.</hi> The Devil first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
such Images in the Fancies of these
Prophets, as may probably determine them
to foretel many things, which he conceives
most likely to fall within his sphere of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and then he accomplisheth as many as
he can, though with no more of true fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
then that man hath that should think
fit, when he knows them, to fulfil many of
his Neighbors Dreams. And he is the more
ready to interpose his power in this business,
because when men shall see their Prophecies
or Dreams, of future contingencies especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
thus strangely issued, they will stroke
their heads presently, and make no doubt
of their near approaches to the prophetick
grace; and whilest other men are detained

some account of those successes which these

followed with; and withal conclude the
great necessity of some divine Sign to attest
the Prophet or Prophecy, that so it may be

Oracles distinguish'd from the Devil's:
God's being eminent for perspicuity and
Truth, and the Devil's for obscurity and
falshood. God hath given us this character
to know a false Prophet by,<note n="w" place="margin">Deut. 18. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>When a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
speaketh in the Name of the Lord, if the
thing follow not, nor come to pass, this is the
thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the
Prophet hath spoken it presumptuously;</hi> and
therefore we may rest assured, that God, if
he<note n="x" place="margin">1 Kin. 8, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>speak with his mouth, will fulfil with his
hand.</hi> True indeed, we read of some divine
Prophecies of great Blessings and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
not literally fulfilled: But these (as
God himself<note n="y" place="margin">Jer. 18. 7, 8, 9</note> tells us) though absolute in
their terms, yet were always conditional in
their interpretation; and therefore when
ever they were not fulfilled in terms, there
was some great sin or repentance interposing
which gave a very rational account thereof
to the minds of men. But all divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
absolute both in its terms and intent,
constantly was fulfilled. Now when the
Prophecy was such, the People might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by such Signs as these, *If the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
were sealed with the Oath of God, or
some equivalent asseveration:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41215:52"/>
*If it were often repeated by the same or

devoted to destruction:<note place="margin">1 King. 15. 29.</note> *If the things
foretold were of an indifferent nature, not
greatly good or evil, and many such like.
These I say constantly came to pass: and
therefore to those words of the people (which
thought a Prophecy delay'd, forgotten) I
oppose the words of God appealing to the
Experience of these very People: <hi>My Words

                  <p>The strong Opinion of Inspiration in Modern Prophets,
proved an effect of the power of Melancholy. Their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Visions attributed to the same cause. The Visions
of melancholy men, why many, and to them very evident.
Their vehement incitations to Prophecy proved also a

which any pretender to prophecy
might have cited in his vindication, as well
as he.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Those wonderful Visions represented to
their minds in some Ecstacy or profound sleep.</hi>
At such a time some very frightful or love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
images shew themselves upon the Scene
of Fancy, and those (as dreams take figure
from the occasions of the day) generally
made after the likeness of those Apocalyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
or other Prophetick Visions, with
which the minds of such persons when
awake are commonly entertained and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sealed. Now these <hi>Visa,</hi> by the great
singularity of their form, vivacity of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41215:55"/>
and prophetical analogy, do so
wonderfully affect and possess the Mind,
and inchant it with such huge fears or joys,
that the Melancholy person doubts not to
receive them with the faith and affection of
Divine discoveries. And therefore if the
more terrible aspect of the images represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his mind, proclaim them the proper
emblems of some great evils, he presently
concludes that God, who tenders his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
with the care and affection a Mother
doth her sucking child, would willingly
have them forewarned, that so they might
by repentance, prayers or prudence avert the
impendent evil from themselves, or fortifie
their minds with Christian patience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
its coming. But if their more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
form prefer them the types of some joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Event, as is the freedom of the Church
laboring under some heavy oppression, the
propagation of the Gospel, and the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christs Kingdom; they hastily
catch at the welcome token, and that is
thought foretold therein which themselves
have the greatest passion for. And they
are the more soft and easy to such propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
conceits, because those passions of
<hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> so intimate to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and which generally govern the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
even of wiser men, are so regnant
in their Souls made so impressive by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41215:55"/>
and some tinctures of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Now these pretended Visions, which
conciliate Veneration to these Prophets with
ruder persons, will appear much beneath
our wonder, if it be considered that Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
when it exceeds its just proportions, is
very productive of them. This the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
hath noted,<note n="i" place="margin">

                  <hi>Men that are of a talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

have so deep a resentment of the most affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
objects, whose images therefore recur
to the fancy when they are asleep, in most
distinct and lively figures. Now the Visions
of such men are the more evident and lively,
because of the dryness of their temper (as

                  <hi>Gallen</hi> gives the reason) whereby there
are no such mysts and vapors rising up to
confound and obscure them, which are the
cause why the night-Visions of persons full
fed, or overcome with wine, are so confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and leave such languishing impressions
upon their waking Fancies. These images
being so clear and active, the mind takes
them (as the birds did those on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of <hi>Apelles)</hi> for true and real things;
and as when we suddainly awake out
of some very affecting dream, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
which its clearness and strength of
impression made upon the Fancy, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41215:56"/>
not presently be blotted out, but we
continue for a time to entertain it with
the affections of a great reality; thus (but
by a more obstinate delusion) are the
persons we now speak of imposed upon
by an unruly Fancy. For when deep sleep
hath fallen upon them, and cut the Soul off
from all converse with things sensible, it is
wholy immerst in the view of those images
which walk upon the stage of Imagination,
with which the common sense is as inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moved, as if excited by some object
from abroad; and therefore it receives them
with the Opinion of their being not phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical
but real and divine appearances. As
for those Visions these Prophets speak of
when they are awake, they may arise from
those<note n="m" place="margin">V. Joh. de Guevar. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Sens. l. 3. q. 30.</note> vehement and intense thoughts,

When ever God gave Prophecy to his
Church, as it usually came attended with
some other eminent gifts, whereby men
might understand it was an Age of Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries;
so it was alway ushered by some
promise thereof. God gave Prophecy to
the Church of the Old Testament, and to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41215:61"/>
the Times wherein our Savior was first ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
and preached to the world (stiled the

                  <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioel.</hi> God would
not have so great a gift, that comes forth (as

                  </gap>, <hi>Holy

we have no special promise, we have no
ground at all of expectation or trust, and if
we trust our Faith with any pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
and Revelation though presented with
all the probable appearances of truth, before
we know whether God hath made promise
of any such matter now, we do but tempt
God, and expect he should charge himself
with us while we walk <hi>in praecipitiis,</hi> in
waies wherein he never told us we should

as many persons inspired only by

that which was the great security to the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41215:61"/>
minds of good men then, that they were
not cheated by any of the gilded Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
then current among them, was, that
God had made them a Promise to send them
Prophets from time to time to resolve them
in all matters relating to this life as well as
the other: and therefore they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the Providence of God would be more
especially watchful to preserve them (if not
greatly wanting to themselves) from being
fatally abused while expecting instruction
by a Prophecy, a way of divine Sanction in
those times. In confidence especially of this
divine security, we find even<note n="n" place="margin">

without scruple to action, and in

from God upon that occasion; whereas
now a Prince would but fall the Martyr of
his own credulity, if trusting his affairs with
the most importunate voices of a pretending
Prophet against sober Reasons of State,
when there appears neither divine Sign,
nor promise of Prophecy, to warrant his
Faith.</p>
               <p>It is readily acknowledged, that none of
God's true Prophets but came attested at
one time or other with some divine Signs;
but yet he that shall consider that these
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41215:62"/>
were not vouchsafed to bear testimony to
each particular message which they delivered
as from God, and that many Signs were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by them (as the causing of iron to swim,
disclosing the secrets of the bedchamber,
foretelling the death of some person, and
some seeming contingencies) which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall within the Devil's compass to shew;
and that sometimes the Prophets<note n="o" place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 3, 4.</note> counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
their own counsels and advices, and
that those holy men were no more exempt
from the delusions of Melancholy then
good men are now; and that Miracles have
been so counterfeited by the Arts of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
that even wise men have not been able
to detect the imposture; must needs grant,
that the promise of God to teach men by
Prophecy, together with the Prophet his
appearing (as the <hi>Iews</hi> speak) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>a Man fit for Prophecy,</hi> was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
the firmest ground of trust they had
to build the faith of the Divinity of his Signs
and Prophecy upon. And therefore I think
many Signs might more firmly conclude the
divine inspiration of men in those Ages to
which Prophecy was promised, then the
like can do if tendred by any Pretender to
inspiration in our own.</p>
               <p>Now then, there being not the least air of
any promise of Prophecy made to the last
Times of the World, we have reason to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41215:62"/>
think that the Prophetick Spirit is flown
back to Heaven (like <hi>Elijah)</hi> and hath left
nothing behind it, but its <hi>mantle,</hi> its garb and
dress, which Imposture sometimes walks up
and down the World withal. As for that place

Prophecy now;<note place="margin">Joel 2. 28.</note>

fixeth the accomplishment of that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the liberal effusions of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
gifts of the Spirit upon that great Day:
where we may note by the way, that he
seems not to understand the place of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy

of which alone it is alledged by our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
but for those other extraordinary gifts
of the Spirit there mentioned, and for which
<hi>Prophecy</hi> doth often suppose elswhere in
Scripture.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>All other extraordinary gifts which
anciently attended the Prophetick Spirit, are

have all expired with their occasion; and
why should we imagine that <hi>Prophecy</hi> (num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with them) survives them all? a gift
of which I am sure the World hath incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
less need then of any of the rest!
Those other gifts of the Spirit could ease
the pains, enlighten the Eyes, resolve the
Conscience, <hi>presently</hi> confirm the Faith of
men, which a Prophecy could not do: and
therefore whereas we find those gifts very
familiarly used, and liberally conferred in the
first times of the Gospel, yet we meet with
this prophetick gift very rarely exerted by
our Savior or his Apostles; and some of the
Persons who had it (as if they were rarely to
be found) are particularly mentioned in the
New Testament;<note place="margin">Acts 13. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. Agabus, Barnabas,

of so little name and consideration <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the rest, continue in the Church,
when all the other (like Scaffolds when the
House is built) are taken away, now that
<hi>the House of God</hi> is built up, and the Faith
confirmed? Certainly the fond affection
which some men have for Prophecy, and
that strength of face with which others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to it, are the things which suborn their
Understandings to believe that so acceptable
a gift is honored with a longer continuance
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41215:63"/>
in the World then the rest of its Brethren.
If we consult <hi>Antiquity,</hi> it will appear more
likely that this gift alone is faln, there being

                  <hi>The funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental

do what is acceptable unto God, and that Man
may be perfect with God, not barely that they

is alleged by<note n="t" place="margin">Orig. <hi>l.</hi> 7. cont. Cels. <hi>p.</hi> 338. Ed. Cantabr.</note> 
                  <hi>Origen.</hi> Whereas these
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41215:64"/>
Vulgar Prophecies cannot (need not) seal
any divine Doctrine or part of Scripture if
they should be fulfilled; and therefore have
no more real value then the seal in separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the writing. They tell us perhaps
(which no wise man much concerns himself
to know) that after such a period of time,
such a great Prince shall ascend the Throne,
such a famous Event shall fall; and if the
Prediction chance to succeed, the Prophet
looks big, and the People wonder, and that's
all. Moreover, <hi>Prophecy served</hi> (like the
<hi>Shechinah</hi> in the Temple) <hi>as a</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Ecclus. 36. 15. Rev. 19. 10. Luk. 7. 16. Joel 2. 28. Isai. 29. 9, 10.</note>

the departing of the Prophetick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
from a people, if found elswhere in the
World, was a Sign God had given them a
bill of divorce. Thus God at last assured his
rejection of the <hi>Iewish</hi> and acknowledgment
of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church, by his taking Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
wholy from the one, and giving it
at the same time unto the other; that
which<note n="w" place="margin">Orig. cont. Cels. <hi>l. 7. p.</hi> 337</note> 
                  <hi>Origen</hi> and<note n="x" place="margin">Iust. M. Dial. cum <hi>Tryp. p.</hi> 211. &amp; 245.</note> 
                  <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> take
frequent notice of in their Disputes against
the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Heathens.</hi> Now Prophecy is
no more necessary in this Age then Miracles
to witness Christs presence with his Church,
for she hath had it liberally already; and
when it departed, it went not from her to
<hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Turk,</hi> but back to Heaven, leaving
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41215:64"/>
behind it the many virtues of the Spirit, in
themselves more undoubted pledges of his
favor. And besides, the Christian Church
now is crumbled into so many Sects and
Forms, that were Prophecy now in the
World, men would be apt to receive it as a
testimony, not to their Church, but to their
Party, (to which purpose the Faction of
<hi>Rome</hi> pretends it;) and therefore perhaps
Prophecy was to be found in the more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
times both of the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi>
Church, but went away when they began
to distinguish themselves by little Forms
and Notions, lest it should seem to witness
not to the Truth of God, but humors of
Men.</p>
               <p>A third Reason assigned by some<note n="y" place="margin">Deus prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas mittendo fecit ne opus haberemus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologis &amp; divinatoribus &amp; ariolis, quoniam illos consulere pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumus, &amp;c. <hi>Maimon. apud D.

                  <hi>Iewish</hi>
and <hi>Christian</hi> Writers, why God gave the
People of the <hi>Iews</hi> their Oracles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
to give them the knowledge of Futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
as the success of a Battel, the issue
of a Sickness, the condition of other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
in after-times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is this; <hi>Because
else in all likelihood they would have aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
to the Rites of the Heathen,</hi> who had
their Oracles and Diviners <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>being prompted thereunto by that
natural liquorousness in the minds of men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the knowledg of things to come,</hi> as<note n="z" place="margin">
                     <hi>Orig. cont. Cels.</hi> l. 1. p. 28. l. 3. p. 113.</note> 
                  <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
gives the reason; and<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 18. 14, 15.</note> Scripture seems
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41215:65"/>
to assign the same why God gave them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
even to secure them from all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to consult the Oracles of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
which we find they sometimes did in
the<note n="b" place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 6, 7.</note> silence or<note n="c" place="margin">2 Kin. 1. 2.</note> absence of the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
To suppose Prophecy necessary now
for this end, to save mens longing after the
knowledg of things sealed up in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of God, is to reproach the World, and
to suppose it as liquorish as in its more child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
years. Hath not the World out-grown
the follies of Auguries, Soothsaying, and
profest Diviners long ago, and took up in
the resolves of Reason, as the best Oracle
to consult in a civil business? and must
Christians be thought the onely persons
that want a Prophecy to arrest their anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in reference to hereafter, and a Prophecy
of the certain truth whereof they are as
much unresolved as of the issue of affairs?
And besides, we shall observe how God
sometimes chastised that wanton humor in
the <hi>Iews,</hi> by permitting even his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
to be, not seldom, the<note n="d" place="margin">2 King. 8. 13, 14, 15. 2 King. 10. 10. 1 King. 11. 31, 40.</note> occasions of
very evil Effects.</p>
               <p>If we proceed to a view of those Ends which
<hi>prophecy</hi> serv'd to more specially in the times
of the New Testament, it will more clearly
appear a great impertinence now. It served
then as a divine largess to grace the solemn
Inauguration of our Saviour to his Mediatory
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41215:65"/>
Kingdom: To assure the acceptance of his
person and undertaking with God, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
him to confer such great gifts on
men. To fore-warn and so to fore-arm
young Coverts, apt otherwise to be scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized
by the then approaching persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for Christ's sake. To seal the reception
of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the dignity of Sonship,
upon whom God had bestowed so great a
portion of his Spirit. To prefer the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Oeconomy to as sacred regards with
men as the <hi>Iewish</hi> had of old, because at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with as liberal an effusion of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
gifts upon men, as that was.
Now it were greatly to under-rate the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
time and my own, to prove Prophecy
in this Age utterly unnecessary for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of any such ends as these. So that there
appears not any sufficient Reason why we
should believe there are any Examples of the
Prophetick Spirit now extant in the World.
Miracles and Prophecies always came forth
from God to serve some great occasions, (his
Servants never wrought a Miracle, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
an Event, as Juglers shew tricks, or
Gypsies tell fortunes, onely to cause wonder
or to supply discourse:) now these occasions
being long ago expired, it is but reasonable
to presume that Miracles and Prophecies are
faln with them.</p>
               <p>To all this perhaps it will be opposed,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41215:66"/>
That oft-times a very black and tedious
night of affliction covers the Servants of
God, and that a Prophecy might then serve
as the voice of the Cock to bring the joyful
news of an approaching morning of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and that for this end also God often
favored his ancient People the <hi>Iews</hi> with
Prophecy, even to let them understand
when their miseries should determine, lest
they <hi>should grow weary and faint in their
minds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; God hath now supplied good
men with higher cordials then a Prophecy
to support their sinking spirits with in a day
of Evil. He hath confirmed his singular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to them by the great gift of his Son,
he hath told them that <hi>all things shall work
together for their</hi> temporal or eternal <hi>good,</hi>
that they have <hi>a merciful High-Priest that
is touch'd with a feeling of all their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
that their <hi>light affliction which is but
for a moment works for them a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
and eternal weight of glory;</hi> and are
not these Considerations better to them then
ten Prophecies? Besides, God having now
caused the felicities of the other World to
stand before us in so full a light, he would
have our minds less intangled with sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and unquiet thoughts about the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turities
of this. It greatly becomes us now
to be more heroical and manly in our hopes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41215:66"/>
and resolutions then the <hi>Iews</hi> were, whose
temper was as weak, wordly and carnal, as
their way of Worship; in compliance with
which God encouraged their service by a
Covenant made up of worldly Promises,
<hi>possession of the Land, the abundance of all
things, freedom from evils and bondage.</hi>
Now, lest in a tedious affliction they should
think God had forgotten his Covenant,
and should cast about for some new Master,
the Prophets were sent from time to time, to
resolve them of the cause and continuance
thereof, and (that their patience might not
tire) to tell them when their <hi>warfare</hi> should
be accomplish'd. Besides, their notices of
the felicities of the other World, being so
obscure and languishing, might easily render
them to greater impatience of the undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
miseries of this: and therefore when
in the times of the second Temple they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be more clear in the Doctrine of a
Resurrection and a life to come, Prophecies
of a temporal reference became more rare;
as appears from the words of that<note n="e" place="margin">Psa. 74. 9.</note> Psalm,
written (it is thought) after the Captivity,
where the Church under great pressures
thus bemoans her self: <hi>We see not our Signs,
there is no more any Prophet, neither is there
any among us that knoweth how long:</hi> which
words suggest to us a fourth Reason.<note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>Prophecy expired in the</hi> Jewish <hi>Church
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41215:67"/>
for two or three hundred years before the
coming of our Savior.</hi> This is a truth of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
acknowledgment, all <hi>Ievish</hi> and
<hi>Christian</hi> Writers confess it but only <hi>Iustin
Martyr,</hi> who once and again<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Dialog. cum <hi>Tryph. p.</hi> 211. &amp; 245.</note> tell; <hi>Trypho</hi>
the <hi>Iew, There never ceased in your Nation,
either Prophet or Prince till Iesus Christ was
both born and had suffred.</hi> But in this Opinion
that excellent Man stands against all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
and against<note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 74. 9.</note> Canon and<note n="h" place="margin">1 Mac. 9. 27. 4. 46. 14. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Apocrypha;</hi>
and therefore his Testimony not binding.
Now if Prophecy ceased then, we have no
reason to presume it continues now; for
what ever Arguments seem to conclude it
necessary to the <hi>Christian</hi> Church now,
would with much more strength conclude
the necessity of it to the <hi>Iewish</hi> then: for
the Scripture was then more dark and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat
then now, the People were of a
more weak and worldly temper, the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
more carnal, the Age more accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Prophecies, Men more in danger of
being tempted by the absence of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to consult the Devil's Prophets and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
then so frequent in the World, and a
succession of Prophets more fully promised
without any limitation of time, then now.
Besides, the reason of its cessation seems to
have been catholick, <hi>viz.</hi> this: It had
now ministred to all those great Ends to
which it was thought necessary in the Times
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41215:67"/>
to which it was vouchsafed; and therefore
(as it is said of <hi>David)</hi> having thus <hi>served
its Generation, it fell asleep.</hi> For though it
be true that the cessation of Prophecy, as
also the absence of the many Glories from
the Second Temple which the First had,
might serve to take men off from looking
too intently upon the face of <hi>Moses,</hi> whose
splendor plainly appeared to be nigh to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
away, and to quicken their desires
after the more inward and abiding Glories of
the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s Kingdom, and to cause them
<hi>to expect that New Dispensation so long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
before, which should restore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
Spirit more abundantly;</hi> yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this to be neither the onely nor the
principal Reason of that long <hi>interstitium</hi> of
Prophecy in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church. For the
Ark, the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> the heavenly fire, and
the rest, were ceremonial appendices, and
served the pomp and splendor of that Lower
Dispensation, the utter absence whereof
from the second Temple might shew that
Oeconomy now waxing old and wearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
but Prophecy lasted (it is concluded)
for at least forty or fifty years under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Temple, and besides was given rather
for Moral then Ceremonial Ends, which
having sufficiently served, it was beneath
the sacredness thereof to be continued to
serve onely the pomp of the Church,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41215:68"/>
or the curiosities of Men.</p>
               <p>The onely thing now occurring to my
thoughts, which may seem to weaken the
force of this Reason, is the common Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a <gap reason="foreign">

He, coming to speak of <hi>Moses</hi> and some
Jewish Customs, makes (after the manner
of the Heathen) a very invidious relation
of what Arts he used to oblige so great a
multitude his Followers. One of which,
he saith was a promise to deliver to them,
<hi>Such a worship, and such rites of Sacrifice,
as should not trouble the Users of them with
any great expenses, nor prophetical raptures
and ecstacies, nor any other absurd businesses
in Religion.</hi> A Speech that assures <hi>Strabo</hi>
not over-fond of such things himself, for
else he could not so easily have believed a
promise of deliverance from them, the best
bait <hi>Moses</hi> could use to catch the hearts of
the Multitude withall. But certain it is that
no promise was further from his thoughts
then this; for his law was a<note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 9. 10. Eph. 2. 15.</note> law of rites and
costly sacrifices, and his great with was that

that himself more pretended or<note n="t" place="margin">Deut. 18. 15. 18.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised

that (as most lies bottom upon some truth)
this Relation was originally but some tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
prophecy of the State of the times
under the <hi>Messiah</hi> current (among some
others) among the Jews, or else a right opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

Prophecy and Sacrifice might (as some

               <p>If all these considerations might obtain
with men to give no faith or (which is next
to it) a very slow and doubtful one to all
pretended Prophets now, the happy conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
would be the freedom of the world at
last from these ancient cheats, for these
little Oracles (like those of old) would soon
become less talkative if men were once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
less credulous; and God would no
more be look'd for in the <hi>whirl-wind</hi> of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
mystical phrases, and ecstatical Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but in the <hi>still voice</hi> of a great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
a sound mind, and an heart reconciled
to himself and all the world; and they would
begin to believe God knows better what is
good for us then we do our selves, while hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
futurities from us, that so we might not
be discomposed by any joys, sorrows or fears
born out of due time; and they would cast
anchor onely upon his Promises and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
when <hi>afflicted with all his waves,</hi>
and value them as sufficient security to the
peace and quiet of their minds in the worst
of Evils. Finally all the Ends the Devil
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41215:73"/>
seeks to serve upon such Prophecies would
be happily defeated; who if they chance to
hit, fails not to possess the <hi>Deliverer</hi> of them
with an impregnable perswasion that he is
God's <hi>Holy One,</hi> his <hi>(Urim)</hi> sacred Oracles
being found with him; and the <hi>Receiver</hi>
with such great Opinions of them as shall
render him curious, credulous, anxious,
impertinent in his studies, and regardless of
the known rules of life. But if they miss,
he tempts men to a suspicion of all Prophecy
for the sake of the false, and to regard even
the Revelations of Scripture but as more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
impostures.</p>
