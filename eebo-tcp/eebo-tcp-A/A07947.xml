            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince my coming into
Priſon, what with the
ſtrangnes of the place,
and ſtrictneſſe of my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
I am ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that I could not follow that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
wherein I tooke great delight and
cheife pleaſure, and to ſpend my time
Idly would but add more diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to my troubled breaſt, &amp; bring
in this chaos of diſcontentments, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies
muſt ariſe, which wil bring forth
the fruites of an Idle brayne, for <hi>è


Malis minimum.</hi> It is far better to giue
ſome account of time though to little
purpoſe then none at all. To which
end I gathered a handfull of Eſſayes,
&amp; few Characters of ſuch things as by
my owne experience, I could ſay <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum
eſt:</hi> not that thereby I ſhould
either pleaſe the reader, or ſhew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitnes
of inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, or curious ſtyle.
Seing what I write of, is but the child
of ſorrow, bred by diſcontentments
<pb facs="tcp:1576:3"/>
and nouriſht vp with misfortunes, to
whoſe help melancholly <hi>Saturne</hi> gaue
his Iudgement. The night Bird hir in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention,
and the ominous <hi>Rauen</hi>
brought a quill taken from his owne
wing, dipt in the Inke of miſery as
cheife ayders in this great Architect
of ſo row.</p>
            <p>This child is borne and brought to
the Font all things ready, onely there
wants a patron. <hi>Hoc difficillimum eſt.</hi>
For who will defend ſorrow, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
who wil giue him entertainment,
who will countenance this worke the
Author being miſerable, who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the matter, the man being an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
who wil cheriſh the circumſtance
when the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is almoſt periſhed?
Surely <hi>non in his diebus,</hi> for friendſhip
is baniſhed, loue extinguiſhed, natural
affection gone to trauel, gould is dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
then a friend, treaſure is nearer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a kinſman, and mammon better belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
then a ſonne. Yet in this famine
of true friends I will venter vpon you
(moſt louing Vnckle) as a god-father
to this my firſt borne though in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
I can haue but a denyall which if
you doe it muſt dye in obliuion. But
<pb facs="tcp:1576:3"/>
why ſhould I feare ſince you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
bin my anchor when I haue bin
Ship-wrackt, and many times ſaued
my poore Barque when it was ready
to ſplit. Why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhold I doubt of your
friendly patronage which haue neuer
fayled me? Be bould then, and goe thy
way, thou ſhalt be entertained though
not for any worth which is in thee, yet
in reſpect thou doſt but ſhew a willing
heart, and doſt endeauour to expell
ingratitude a thing moſt odious not
onely to man but God, not to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
but Heathens, not to Heathens
but Beaſts.</p>
            <p>What then ſhould I giue to you for
all your kindneſſes which you haue
continually beſtowed vpon me which
are ſo many that if I ſhould endeauour
to recite <hi>(Ante diem clauſo componet

doe offer vp vnto the Oracle of your

and the dulnes of my brayne
which this place hath made worſe (and
<pb facs="tcp:1576:4"/>
not to the leſt defect of goodwill.) &amp;
that you would let none but your ſelfe
ſee my imperfections, which are ſufici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
divulged by my owne actions,
&amp; would be vnwilling to haue a ſecond
edition of them by my writing this
was the chiefeſt cauſe I tooke. This in

ſlaue, in full proportion they looke
like the picture of enuy, with their
hands continually diuing into poore
Priſoners pockets, with their heads
vncouered, ſtill proffering courteſies
when their hearts make anſwere, what
kindeneſſe they doe is <hi>(non tibi ſed pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniae,)</hi>
they moſt commonly feede
well, to their maiſters creddit, but the
tablers charge. Now if any take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the badge knaue which I
haue giuen them, as the olde prouerbe
is, touch a gald horſe and he wil kick.
I wil maintain (I ſay) what out of their
owne authors, a bird of their owne
neſt vet not altogether ſo ill, who ſaid
to me that he was weary of his ſlauiſh
life, in reſpect he muſt be knaue in his
place, who ſaid, if he were true to his
Maiſter, he muſt be knaue to priſoners,
if true to priſoners, knaue to his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
So be he honeſt in his vocation,

that ſiluer is well gotten, if by any
