         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>NEWES
FROM
Sir John Sucklin.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">J</seg>T is an old proverb,
that he far runs, that
never turns, as will
be now made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
by this ensuing
story, which will
treat of one which
was accounted a
treacherous and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall
Subject, and not long since made an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
out of this Kingdome, by name Sir <hi>Iohn
Suclin,</hi> who was supposed to be a <hi>Romanist,</hi>
but now will his sufferings make manifest to
the contrary.</p>
            <p>When first he flew out of this Kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he tooke up his habitation in <hi>Roan,</hi> belonging
<pb facs="tcp:97338:3"/>
to the King of <hi>France:</hi> but there some discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
growing betweene another Knight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
he left <hi>Roan,</hi> and to <hi>Paris</hi> he bent his
Journey, where he had much honour attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, in respect of his furnishing a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men and horses, against the <hi>Scots:</hi> in the
time of Dissention between both Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Paris</hi> as aforesaid, he lived in great honor
where he fell in league with the Lady <hi>
                  <unclear>Damaise</unclear>
               </hi>
nigh kinswoman to the Dutches of <hi>Sheverey,</hi>
but a protestant.</p>
            <p>This Lady bore affection to him, after the
same manner that he did to her, but upon this
condition, that he should purge himselfe of all
popish dregs whatsoever.</p>
            <p>To which hee most willing condiscended,
and thereupon renounced the Pope, with all
his Complicies.</p>
            <p>But this is requisit to be declared, that there
was a Lord in <hi>Paris,</hi> by name <hi>Lequeux,</hi> which
bore affection to the same Lady, and to have
his desire, invented a plot to take away Sir
<hi>Iohn Sucklins</hi> life: but he having notice ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
acquainted his Lady with the pretended
purpose of the Lord <hi>Lequeux,</hi> whereupon she
desired him to flye to some other parts.</p>
            <p>But his reply was, enjoying her society hee
<pb facs="tcp:97338:3"/>
would be ambitious to flye any whither, but
otherwise to stay the worst thing which could
happen, would be but death, and not to enjoy
her company would be no lesse.</p>
            <p>To whose request, she willingly granted, and
in a short space, they together tooke shipping
and sayled to the hither parts of Spaine: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
these two Turtles without any interception
thought for to be.</p>
            <p>But alas! Fortune did prove adverse against
them, and instead of blessing their hope with
a prosperous Gale, she played the part of stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Boreas, and split their ship against an
envious Rocke.</p>
            <p>For being arrived safely, as they did thinke,
within the Confines of Spaine, the afore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
malicious Lord <hi>Lequeux,</hi> having notice
given of their escape, presently pursued them,
and having overtaken them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> complained to
the great Arch-priest of Spain, how that they
were both Traytors to <hi>Rome,</hi> and were arrived
in <hi>Spaine</hi> for no other cause, but to conspire
the death of the great Master, and King of
<hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To confirme and bind which accusation, he
swore by the Sacrament, and sacred body of
Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97338:4"/>
Whereupon the <hi>Arch-priest</hi> committed Sir
<hi>Iohn Suclin</hi> to the custody of those of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion,</hi>
and his Lady to a close prison, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
being given, that unlesse Sir <hi>Iohn Suclin</hi>
did recant from any intent to doe injury unto
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he should not want
for torments, according to the antient custom
of the <hi>Inquisition.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> made answer thus.
That both his Lady and himselfe were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
falsly; for although he bore no affection
to the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet was he far from any
intent for doing the least Member of it any
wrong: much more the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
chiefe Agent to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>withstanding, hee was committed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
suffered those torments which are commonly
inflicted upon those which are prisoners to
the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> once had he the <hi>Spanish Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pado,</hi>
twice tortured by sharpe needles, three
times did he lodge in a stinking Dungeon, and
upon the fourth day was carryed to heare the
Sentence of Death passe upon him; but was
miraculously delivered, for the Lord <hi>Lequex</hi>
going to accuse him the second time, was
struck downe, and by signes first, and then by
writing, did confesse to the whole Assembly,
that hee had falsly accused Sir John Sucklin
and his Lady.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97338:4"/>
Whereupon they were both delivered, and
the Lord <hi>Lequex</hi> committed to tortures.</p>
            <p>Sir John and his Lady are now living
at the <hi>Hague in Holland,</hi> piously
and religiously, and grieves
at nothing, but that
he did the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
wrong.</p>
