            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

His petition is to your honours for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure, his quarell is to the Clergie for Religion, and his drift (as farforth, as yet, it may bee perceiued) is to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her Maiestyes louing and faythfull Subiectes, with showe of Catholike Priesthood and profession. Vnto your honours he directed the Challenge to be receiued: and vnto your honours with all humility I send it answered

submitting my selfe and the whole to your wisedomes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; fauorable interpretations. It is no new deuise, but an old practice of Satan, thus to send forth his wicked spirites, to sow tares among the wheat, who wayting all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not daring in the clere light and broad day to work his feats, doth it by stelth, and in the night season, when men sleepe in the security of Sinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherfore the Kinge ruleth, the Priest prayeth, the husbandman ploweth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one in his calling, is to serue the Lord, and that in watchfulnes. My selfe as the simplest, togeather with my bretherne of the Clergie we (I say) ioyntlye are greatlye bound to render vnto God harty thankes, and praises, for the vertuous, peaceable, and prosperous raigne of our soueraygne Lady the Quenes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maiesty, in whose blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes we are blessed, in whose peace we enioy quietnes, and of whose vertue and piety we are partakers. Her tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall swerd aduaunceth the swerd of the Spirite, which is the worde of God, and the messengers therof are shielded vnder her shadow and countenaunce. As Daniell sayed of his Lorde and Mayster the Kinge, so say wee dayly and hourely of our Lady and Mistres the Queene: O noble Queene liue for euer. Secondlye wee blesse God for your honours, and instantly craue the continuance of your health, with the encrease of all heauenly knowledge in your calling to countenaunce vnder her Maiesty the preaching of Gods worde, to commaund the buildinge of his church, and to roote out those that goe aboute to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the vineyarde of the Lord. And presently touching the challenge of this bragging Champion, in the name of my fellow laborers, and brethren of the Clergie: I refer the determination therof vnto your Lordships<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that
<pb facs="tcp:27931:3"/>
if you graunt it either priuately or publiquely, he shall bee disputed withall. His bragge is but bumbast, their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in showe not in substance, they haue wordes and not truth. I will not presume to craue licence for him, but hartely wish with the Apostle, that they were cut of which molest vs, and the quiet state of the Church of England. Thirdly in brotherly loue I am to desire of her Maiesties louing subiects, not lightly to credite such insole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t brags: not vnaduisedly to receiue such wandrers from Rome: but in the feare of God to beholde, what is and hath bene sayd for the truth, and to cleaue fast vnto the word of God. And so I ceasse further to trouble your Lordships, but with remembraunce of my humble duty I pray vnto the lord long to blesse &amp; preserue your Honors.</p>
