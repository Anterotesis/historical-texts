            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honorable, mine especiall good Lord, S. <hi>Roger Manwood</hi> Knight, Lord chief Baron of her Majesties Court of the Eschequer.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N-so-much as I know that your Lordship is by nature wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and in purpose earnestly bent to relieve the poor, and that not onely with hospitality and almes, but by divers other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises and waies tending to their comfort, having (as it were) framed and set your self to the help and maintenance of their estate, as appeareth by your charge and travell in that behalf. Whereas also you have a speciall care for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of their right, and redressing of their wrongs, as neither despising their calamity, nor yet forgetting their complaint, seeking all means for their amendment, and for the reformation of their disorders, even as a very father to the poor. Finally, for that I am a poor member of that <hi>Common-wealth</hi> where your Lordship is a principall person; I thought this my travell, in the behalf of the poor, the aged, and the simple, might be very fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto you: for a weak house requireth a strong stay. In which respect I give God thanks, that hath raised up unto me so mighty a friend for
<pb facs="tcp:58850:3"/>
them as your Lordship is, who in our laws have such knowledge, in government such discretion, in these causes such experience, and in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth such authority; and never the lesse vouchsafe to descend to the consideration of these base and inferior matters, which minister more care and trouble, than worldly estimation.</p>
            <p>And insomuch as your Lordship knoweth, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excerciseth the office of a Judge, whose part it is to hear with courtesie, and to determine with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; it cannot but be apparent unto you, that when punishment exceedeth the fault, it is rather to be thought vengeance than correction. In which respect I know you spend more time and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell in the conversion and reformation, than in the subversion and confusion of offenders, as being well pleased to augment your own private pains, to the end you may diminish their publike smart. For in truth, that Common-wealth remaineth in wofull state, where fetters and halters bear more sway than mercy and due compassion.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, it is naturall to unnaturall people, and peculiar unto witchmongers, to pursue the poor, to accuse the simple, and to kill the innocent; supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in rigor and malice towards others, that which they themselves want in proof and discretion, or the other in offence or occasion. But as a cruel heart and an honest minde do seldome meet and feed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a dish; so a discreet &amp; merciful Magistrate, and a happy Common-wealth cannot be separated asunder. How much then are we bound to God, who hath given us a Queen, that of justice is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the very perfect <hi>image</hi> and <hi>patern,</hi> but also of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>clemency</hi> (under God) the meer <hi>fountain</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:58850:3"/>
body it self? Insomuch as they which hunt most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bloud in these daies, have least authority to shed it. Moreover, sith I see that in cases where <hi>lenity</hi> might be <hi>noisom,</hi> and <hi>punishment wholsom</hi> to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; there no respect of person can move you, no <hi>authority</hi> can <hi>abash you,</hi> no <hi>fear,</hi> no <hi>threats</hi> can <hi>daunt</hi> you in performing the duty of Justice.</p>
            <p>In that respect again I find your Lordship a fit person to judge &amp; look upon this present Treatise. Wherein I will bring before you, as it were to the bar, two sorts of most arrogant and wicked people, the first challenging to themselves, the second attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting unto others, that power which only apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth to God,<note place="margin">Apo. 4.11. Rom 8. Acts 5. Apo. 2. Luk. 16. Dan. 2. &amp; 28. &amp; 47.: Psalme 72. &amp; 136. Jeremy 5. Job 5. &amp; 36. Samuel 12. 1 Reg. 8. 2 Reg 3. Isaiah. 5. Zac. 10. &amp; 14. Amos. 4.7. Job 1. Isaith. 42.8.</note> 
               <hi>who onely is the Creator of all things, who onely searcheth the heart and reines,</hi> who onely <hi>knoweth our imaginations and thoughts,</hi> who onely <hi>openeth all secrets,</hi> who onely <hi>worketh great wonders,</hi> who onely hath power <hi>to raise up and cast down; who onely maketh thunder, lightning, rain, tempests,</hi> and restraineth them at his pleasure; who onely <hi>sendeth life and death, sicknesse and health, wealth and wo; who neither giveth nor lendeth his glory to any creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therfore, that which grieveth me to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my heart, is that these witchmongers cannot be content to wrest out of Gods hand his almighty power, &amp; keep it themselvs, or leav it with a witch: but that, when by drift of argument they are made to lay down the bucklers, they yield them up to the divil, or at the least pray aide of him, as though the rains of all mens lives and actions were committed into his hand; and that he sat at the stern, to guide &amp; direct the course of the whole world, imputing unto him power &amp; ability enough to do as great things, and as strange miracles as ever Christ did.</p>
            <p>But the doctors of this supernatural doctrine say
<pb facs="tcp:58850:4"/>
sometimes, that the witch doth all these things by vertue of her charms; sometimes that a spiritual, sometimes that a corporal devil doth accomplish it; sometimes they say that the devil doth but make the witch beleeve she doth that which he himselfe hath wrought, sometimes that the devil seemeth to do that by compulsion, which he doth most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Finally, the writers hereupon are so eloquent, &amp; full of variety; that somtimes they write that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doth all this by Gods permission only; somtimes by his licence, sometimes by his appointment: so as (in effect and truth) not the devil, but the high and mighty King of kings, and Lord of hosts, even God himself, should this way be made obedient and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile to obey and perform the will &amp; commandment of a malicious old witch, &amp; miraculously to answer her appetite, as well in every trifling vanity, as in most horrible executions; as the revenger of a doting old womans imagined wrongs, to the destruction of many innocent children, and as a supporter of her passions, to the undoing of many a poor soul. And I see not, but a witch may as well inchant, when she will; as a lier may lie when he list: and so should we possesse nothing, but by a witches licence and permission.</p>
            <p>And now forsooth it is brought to this point, that all devils, which were wont to be spiritual, may at their pleasure become corporal, and so shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves familiarly to witches and conjurors, and to none other, and by them only may be made tame, and kept in a box, &amp;c. So as a malicious old woman may command her devil to plague her neighbor: &amp; he is afflicted in manner &amp; form as she desireth. But then cometh another witch, and she biddeth her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil help, and he healeth the same party. So as they
<pb facs="tcp:58850:4"/>
make it a kingdome divided in it self, and therefore I trust it will not long endure, but will shortly be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, according to the words of our Saviour, <hi>Omne regnum in se divisum desolabitur,</hi> Every king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome divided in it self shall be desolate.</p>
            <p>And although some say that the devil is the witches instrument, to bring her purposes and practises to passe: yet others say that she is his instrument, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his pleasure in any thing, and therefore to be executed. But then (methinks) she should be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously dealt withall, and put to death for anothers offence: for actions are not judged by instrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al causes; neither doth the end and purpose of that which is done, depend upon the mean instrument. Finally, if the witch do it not, why should the witch die for it? But they say that witches are perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and think, that they do indeed those mischifs; &amp; have a will to perform that which the devil commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; and that therefore they are worthy to dy. By which reason ev'ry one should be executed, that wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth evil to his neighbor, &amp;c. But if the will should be punished by man, according to the <hi>offence</hi> against God, we should be driven by thousands at once to the slauterhouse or butchery.<note place="margin">Proverbs 5.</note> For whosoever loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth correction shall die. And who should escape ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, if this lothsomnesse (I say) should extend to death by the civil lawes. Also the reward of sin is death. Howbeit, every one that sinneth, is not to be put to death by the Magistrate. But my Lord it shall be proved in my book, and your Lordship shall trie it to be true, as well here at home in your native country, as also abrode in your several circuits, that (besides them that be <hi>Veneficae,</hi> which are plaine poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners) there will be found among our witches on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two sorts; the one sort being such by <hi>imputation,</hi> as

            <p>But it will perchance be said by <hi>witchmongers</hi>; to wit, by such as attribut to witches the power which appertaineth to God only, that I have made choise of <hi>your Lordship</hi> to be a <hi>Patrone</hi> to this my book; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I think you favor mine opinions, and by that means may the more freely publish any error or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of mine own, which should rather be warranted by <hi>your Lordships authority,</hi> then by the word of <hi>God,</hi> or by sufficient argument.

            <head>To the right worshipfull Sir <hi>Thomas Scot,</hi> Knight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, I see among other malefactors many poor old women convented before you for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Miracles,</hi> otherwise called witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, &amp; therefore I thought you also ameet person to whom I might commend my book. And here I have occasion to speak of your sincere admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of justice, and of your dexterity, discretion, charge, and travel emploied in that behalf, whereof I am <hi>oculatus testis.</hi> Howbeit I had rather refer the Reader to common fame, and their own eies and ears to be satisfied; then to send them to a Stationers shop, where many times lies are vendible, and truth contemptible. For I being of your house, of your name, and of your bloud; my foot being under your table, my hand in your dish, or rather in your purse, might be thought to flatter you in that, wherein (I know) I should rather offend you than please you. And what need I curry-favour with my most assured friend? And if I should only publish those vertues (though they be many) which give me special occasion to exhibit this my travel unto you, I should do as a painter, that describeth the foot of a notable personage, and leaveth all the best features in his body untouched.</p>
            <p>I therefore (at this time) do only desire you to consider of my report, concerning the evidence that is commonly brought before you against them. See first whether the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be not frivolous, and whether the proofs brought against them be not incredible, consisting of guesses, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions, and impossibilities contrary to reason, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:58850:7"/>
&amp; nature. See also what persons complain upon them, whether they be not of the basest, the u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>wisest &amp; most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse kind of people. Also may it please you to way what accusations and crimes they lay to their charge, namely: She was at my house of late, she would have had a pot of milk, she departed in a chafe because she had it not, she railed, she cursed, she mumbled and whispered, and finally she said she would be even with me: and soon after my child, my cow, my sow, or my pullet died, or was strangely taken. Nay (if it please your Worship) I have further proof: I was with a wise woman, &amp; she told me I had an ill neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and that she would come to my house ere it were long, and so did she; and that she had a mark above her waste, and so had she: and God forgive me, my stomach hath gone against her a great while. Her mother before her was counted a witch, she hath been beaten and scrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the face till bloud was drawn upon her, because she hath bin suspected, and afterwards some of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were said to amend. These are the certainties that I hear in their evidences.</p>
            <p>Note also how easily they may be brought to confess that which they never did, nor lieth in the power of man to do: and then see whether I have cause to write as I do. Further, if you shall see that infidelity, popery, and many other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest heresies be backed and shouldered, and their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors animated and heartned, by yielding to creatures such infinit power as is wrested out of Gods hand, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to witches: finally, if you shall perceive that I have faithfully and truely delivered and set down the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and state of the witch, and also of the witch monger, and have confuted by reason and law, and by the word of God it self, all mine adversaries objections &amp; arguments: then let me have your countenance against them that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously oppose themselves against me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58850:7"/>My greatest adversaries are <hi>young ignorance</hi> and <hi>old custome.</hi> For what folly soever tract of time hath foster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is so superstitiously pursued of some, as though no error could be acquainted with custome. But if the lawe of nations would join with such custom, to the maintenance of ignorance, &amp; to the suppressing of knowledge; the civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest country in the world would soon become barbarous, &amp;c. For as knowledge &amp; time discovereth errors, so doth super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and ignorance in time breed them. And concerning the opinions of such, as wish that ignorance should rather be maintained, than knowledge busily searched for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thereby offence may grow: I answer, that we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Christ himself to search for knowledge:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John 5. Prov. 15.1.</hi>
               </note> for it is the kings honour (as Solomon saith) to search out a thing.</p>
            <p>Aristotle said to Alexander, that a mind well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed was more beautifull then a body richly arraied. What can be more odious to man, or offensive to God, than ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts 3. Proverbs 9.</hi>
               </note> for through ignorance the Iewes did put Christ to death. Which ignorance whosoever forsaketh, is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed life everlasting: and therefore among Christians it should be abhorred above all other things. For even as when we wrestle in the dark, we tumble in the mire, &amp;c. so when we see not the truth, we wallowe in errors. A blind man may seek long in the rushes ere he find a needle; and as soon is a doubt discussed by ignorance. Finally, truth is no sooner found out in ignorance, then a sweet savor in a dunghill. And if they will allow men knowledge, and give them no leave to use it, men were much better be without it than have it. For it is as to have a talent, and to hide it under the earth;<note place="margin">

Truly the heathen herein deserved more commendation then many christians, for they spared no pain no cost, nor travell to attain to knowlede.

For pretious stones, and all other creatures of what value soever, are but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits to this jewell: they are mortall, corruptible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant; this is immortall, pure and certain. Wherefore if I have searched and found out any good thing, that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and time hath smothered, the same I commend unto you: to whom though I owe all that I have, yet am I bold to make others partakers with you in this poor gift.</p>

I shall not need therefore to make any further suite to you, but that it would please you to read my book, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the prejudice of time, or former conceite: and having obtained this at your hands, I submit my self unto your censure. But to make a solemn suit to you that are partial readers, desiring you to set aside partiality, to take in good part my writing, and with indifferent eies to looke upon my book, were labour lost, and time ill imployed. For I should no more prevaile herein, then if a hundred years since I should have intreated your predecessors to beleeve, that Robin good-fellow, that great and antient bull-begger, had been but a cousening merchant, and no devil indeed.</p>
            <p>If I should go to a Papist, and say, I pray you beleeve my writings, wherein I will prove all popish charmes, conjurations, exorcismes, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and curses, not onely to be ridiculous, and of none effect, but also to be impious and contrary to Gods word: I should as hardly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in win favour at their hands, as herein obtain credit at yours. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, I doubt not, but to use the matter so, that as well the massemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for his part, as the witchmonger for his, shall both be ashamed of their professions.</p>
            <p>But Robin good-fellow ceaseth now to be much feared, and popery is sufficiently discovered. Neverthelesse, witches charms, and conjurors cousenages are yet thought effectuall. Yea the Gentiles have espied the fraud of their cousening oracles, and our cold prophets and inchanters make us fools still, to the shame of us all, but specially of Papists, who conjure every thing, and thereby bring to passe nothing. They say to their candles, I conjure you to endure for ever: and yet they last not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noster while the longer. They conjure water to be wholesome both for body and soule: but the body (we see) is never the better for it, nor the soul any whit reformed by it. And therefore I marvel, that when they see their own conjurations confuted and brought to nought, or at the least void of effect, that they (of all other) will yet give such credit, countenance, and authority to the vaine cousenages of witches and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurors; as though their charmes and conjurations could produce more
<pb facs="tcp:58850:11"/>
apparent, certaine, and better effects then their owne.</p>
            <p>But my request unto all you that read my book shall be no more, but that it would please you to conferre my words with your own sense and experience, and also with the word of God. If you find your selves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved and satisfied, or rather reformed and qualified in any one point or opinion, that heretofore you held contrary to truth, in a matter hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto undecided, and never yet looked into; I pray you take that for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: and suspending your judgement, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If this may not suffice for to perswade you, it cannot prevaile to annoy you: and then, that which is written without offence, may be overpassed without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny griefe.</p>

For the world is now at that stay (as <hi>Brentius</hi> in a most godly sermon in these words affirmeth) that even as when the heathen persecuted the Christians, if any were accused to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Christ, the common people cried <hi>Ad leonem</hi>: so now, if any woman, be she never so honest, be accused of witch-craft, they cry <hi>Ad ignem.</hi> What difference is between the rash dealing of unskilfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the grave counsell of more discreet and learned persons, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by a tale of <hi>Danaeus</hi> his own telling; wherein he opposeth the rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a few townsmen, to the counsell of a whole senate: preferring the folly of the one, before the wisdome of the other.</p>

               </gap>leance on Loyre (saith he) there was a man-witch, not only taken and accused, but also convicted and condemned for witch- craft, who appealed from thence to the high court of Paris. Which accusation the senate saw in sufficient, and would not allow, but laughed thereat, lightly regarding it; and in the end sent him home (saith he) as accused of a frivolous matter. And yet for all that, the magistrates of Orleance were so bold with him, as to hang him up within a short time after, for the same or the very like offence. In which example is to be seen the nature, and as it were the disease of this cause: wherein (I say) the simpler and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreeter sort are alwaies more hasty and furious in judgements, than men of better reputation and knowledge. Neverthelesse, <hi>Eunichius</hi> saith that these three things; to wit, what is to be thought of witches, what their incantations can do, and whether their punishment should extend to death, are to be well considered. And I would (saith he) they were as well known, as they are rashly beleeved, both of the learned, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. And further he saith, that almost all divines, physicians and lawyers, who should best know these matters, satisfiing themselves with old custome, have given too much credit to these fables, and to rash and unjust sentence of death upon witches, But when a man pondreth (saith he) that in times past, all that swarved from the church of Rome were judged heretikes; it is the lesse marvell, though in this matter they be blind and ignorant.</p>
            <p>And Surely, if the Scripture had been longer suppressed, more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd fables would have sprung up, and been beleeved. Which credulity though it is to be derided with laughter; yet this their cruelty is to be
<pb facs="tcp:58850:12"/>
lamented with teares. For (God knoweth) many of these poor wretches had more need to be releeved than chastised; and more meet were a preacher to admonish them, than a Jailer to keep them; and a physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an more necessary to helpe them, than an executioner or tormentor to hang or burn them. For proof and due triall hereof, I will requite Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus his tale of a man-witch (as he termeth him) with another witch of the same sex or gender.</p>

               </note> that one Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, a poor servant, being in wit very simple and rude, but in his service very necessary and diligent (and in that respect deerly beloved of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) prosessing the art of witch-craft, could in no wise be disswaded from that profession, perswading himselfe that he knew all things, and could bring any matter to passe; because certain country-people resorted to him for helpe and counsell, as supposing by his own talke, that he could do somewhat. At length he was condemned to be burned: which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he seemed more willing to suffer, than to loose his estimation in that behalfe. But his master having compassion upon him, and being himselfe in his princes favour, perceiving his conceipt to proceed of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, obtained respit of execution for twenty daies. In which time (saith he) his master bountifully fed him with good fat meat, and with four egs at a meale, as also with sweet win: which diet was best for so grosse and weake a body. And being recovered so in strength, that the humor was suppressed, he was easily won from his absurd and dangerous opinions, and from all his fond imaginations: and confesling his error and folly, from the which before no man could remove him by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, having his pardon, he lived long a good member of the Church, whom otherwse the cruelty of judgement should have cast away and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
            <p>This history is more credible than <hi>Sprengers</hi> fables, or <hi>Bodins</hi> bables, which reach not so far to the extolling of witches omnipotency, as to the derogating of Gods glory. For if it be true, which they affirme, that our life and death lyeth in the hand of a witch; then is it false, that God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us live or die, or that by him we have our being, our terme of time appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our daies numbred. But surely their charmes can no more reach to the hurting or killing of men or women, than their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations can extend to the stealing and carrying away of horses and mares. Neither hath God given remedies to sicknesse or griefs, by words or charmes,<note place="margin">Amos 3.6. La. Ier. 3 38. Isai. 45.9. Rom. 9.20.</note> but by hearbs and medicines, which he himself hath created upon earth, and given men knowledge of the same; that he might be glorified, for that therewith he doth vouch safe that the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men and cattle should be cured, &amp;c. And if there be no affiction nor calamity, but is brought to passe by him, then let us defie the devil, renounce all his works, and not so much as once think or dream upon this supernatural power of witches, neither let us prosecute them with such despight, whom our fansie condemneth, and our reason acquitteth: our evidence against them consisting in impossibilities, our proofes in unwritten verities, and our whole proceedings in doubts and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Fables of Witch-craft have taken so fast hold and deep root in the heart of man, that few or none can, (now adaies) with patience indure the hand and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of God. For if any adversity, greefe, sicknesse, losse of children, corn, cattell, or liberty happen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them;<note place="margin">Job 5.</note> by and by they exclaime upon witches. As though there were no God in Israel that ordereth all things according to his will, punishing both just unjust and with greefes, plagues, and afflictions in manner and forme as he thinketh good: but that certain old women here on earth, called witches, must needs be the contrivers of all mens calamities, and as though they themselves were innocents, and had deserved no such punishments. Insomuch as they stick not to ride and go to such, as either are injuriously tearmed witches, or else are willing so to be accounted, seeking at their hands comfort and remedy in time of their tribulation, contrary to Gods will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in that behalfe,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> who bids us resort to him in all our necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>Such faithlesse people (I say) are also perswaded, that neither haile nor snow, thunder nor lightning, rain nor tempestuous winds come from the heavens at the commandement of God; but are raised by the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and power of witches and conjurers; insomuch as a clap of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or a gale of winde is no sooner heard, but either they runne to ring bels, or cry out to burne witches; or else burne consecrated things, hoping by the smoak thereof, to drive the devill out of the aire, as though spirits could be fraid away with such externall toies: howbeit, these are right inchantments,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But certainly, it is neither a witch, nor devil, but a glorious <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 25. Psal 83. Eccles. 43. Luke 8. Math 8. Mark. 4.41. Luk. 8.14.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58850:15"/>
the secret places of the haile,<note place="margin">Job 38.22. Eccles. 43.</note> which GOD hath prepared against the day of trouble, battell, and warre? I for my part also thinke with Jesus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach, that at Gods onely commandement the snow falleth; and that the wind bloweth according to his wil, who onely maketh all stormes to cease; and <note place="margin">Leviti. 26. verse. 3, 4.</note> who (if we keep his ordinances) will send us rain in due season, and make the land to bring forth her increase, and the trees of the field to give their fruit.</p>
                  <p>But little think our witch-mongers, that the <note place="margin">Psa 78.23.</note> Lord commandeth the clouds above, or openeth the doors of heaven, as <hi>David</hi> affirmeth; or that the Lord goeth forth in the tempests and stormes, as the Prophet <note place="margin">Nahum. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Nahum</hi> reporteth: but rather that witches and conjurers are then about their businesse.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Marcionists</hi> acknowledged one God the author of good things, and another the ordainer of evill: but these make the devill a whole God, to create things of nothing, to know mens cogitations, and to do that which God never did; as, to transubstatiate men into beasts, &amp;c. Which thing if devils could do, yet followeth it not, that witches have such power. But if all the devils in hell were dead, and all the witches in <hi>England</hi> burned or hanged; I warrant you we should not fail to have rain, haile and tempests, as now we have: according to the appointment &amp; will of God, &amp; according to the constitution of the elements, and the course of the planets, wherein God hath set a perfect and perpetuall order.</p>
                  <p>I am also well assured, that if all the old women in the world were witches; and all the priests, conjurers: we should not have a drop of rain, nor a blast of wind the more or the lesse for them. For <note place="margin">Job. 26.8. Job. 37. Psalme 135. Jer. 10. &amp; 15. Ose. 13.</note> the Lord hath bound the waters in the clouds, and hath set bounds about the waters, untill the day and night come to an end: yea it is God that raiseth the winds and stilleth them: and he saith to the rain and snowe; Be upon the earth, and it falleth. The <note place="margin">Job. 26.8. Job. 37. Psalme 135. Jer. 10. &amp; 15. Ose. 13.</note> wind of the Lord, and not the wind of witches, shall destroy the treasures of their pleasant vessels, and dry up the fountaines; saith <hi>Oseas.</hi> Let us also learn and confesse with the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> that we <note place="margin">Psa. 39. &amp;c.</note> our selves are the causes of our afflictions; and not exclaim upon witches, when we should call upon God for mercy.</p>
                  <p>The Imperiall law (saith <hi>Brentius</hi>) condemneth them to death that trouble and infect the aire: but I affirme (saith he) that it is neither in the power of witch nor devill so to do, but in God only. Though (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Bodin,</hi> and all the popish writers in generall) it please <hi>Danaeus, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perius, Hemingius, Erastus,</hi> &amp;c. to conclude otherwise.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut the world is now so bewitched and over-run with this fond error, that even where a man should seek com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and counsell, there shall he be sent (in case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity) from God to the devil; and from the Physitian to the cosening witch, who will not stick to take upon her, by words to heal the lame (which was proper only to Christ; and to hem whom he assisted with his divine power) yea, with her familiar and charmes she will take upon her to cure the blind: though in the <note n="‖" place="margin">Joh. 10.21.</note> tenth of S. <hi>Johns</hi> Gospell it be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that the devil cannot open the eyes of the blind.

                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> fore saw the blindnesse and obstinacy, both of these blind shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and also of their scabbed sheep, when he said <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.34.</note> They will not suffer wholsome doctrine, but having their eares itching, shall get them a heap of reachers after their own lusts; and shall turne their eares from the truth, and shall be given to fables.

In which sense <hi>Basil</hi> saith; Who so giveth heed to inchanters, harkeneth to a fabulous and frivilous thing. But I will rehearse an example whereof I my selfe am not only <hi>Oculatus testis,</hi> but have examined the cause, and am to justifie the truth of my report: not because I would disgrace the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters that are godly, but to confirme my former assertion, that this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd error is growne into the place, which should be able to expell all such ridiculous folly and impiety.</p>
                  <p>At the assizes holden at Rochester, Anno 1581. one <hi>Margaret Simons,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58850:16"/>
the wife of <hi>Iohn Simons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A story of Margaret Si<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mons, a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed witch.</note> of <hi>Brenchly</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> was arraigned for witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, at the instigation and complaint of divers fond and malicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and specially by the meanes of one <hi>Iohn Ferrall</hi> vicar of that parish: with whom I talked about that matter and found him both fondly assor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the cause, and enviously bent towards her: and (which is worse) as unable to make a good account of his faith, as she whom he accused. That which he, for his part, laid to the poore womans charge, was this.</p>
                  <p>His son (being an ungracious boy, and prentise to one <hi>Robert Scotchsord</hi> clothier, dwelling in that parish of Brenchly) passed on a day by her house; at whome by chance her little dog barked. Which thing the boy taking in evil part, drew his knife, and pursued him therewith even to her door: whom she rebuked with some such words as the boy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and yet neverthelesse would not be perswaded to depart in a long time. At the last he returned to his masters house, and within five or six daies fell sick. Then was called to mind the fray betwixt the dog and the boy: insomuch as the vicar (who thought himself so privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, as he little mistrusted that God would visit his children with sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) did so calculate; as he found, partly through his own judgement and partly (as he himself told me) by the relation of other witches, that his said sonne was by her bewitched. Yea, he also told me, that this his son (being as it were past all cure) received perfect health at the hands of another witch.</p>
                  <p>He proceeded yet further against her, affirming, that alwaies in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-church, when he desired to read most plainly, his voice so failed him, as he could scant be heard at all. Which he could impute, he said, to nothing else, but to her inchantment. When I advertised the poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hereof, as being desirous to hear what she could say for her selfe; she told me, that in very deed his voice did much faile him, specially when he strained himself to speake lowdest. Howbeit, she said that at all times his voice was hoarse and low, which thing I perceived to be true. But sir; said she, you shall understand, that this our vicar is disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with such a kind of hoarsenesse, as divers of our neighbours in this parish not long since, doubted that he had the French-Pox; and in that respect utterly refused to communicate with him: untill such time as (being thereunto injoined by M. D. Lewen the ordinary) he had brought from <hi>London</hi> a certificat, under the hands of two Physitians, that his hoarsenes proceeded from a disease in the lungs. Which certificate he published in the church, in the presence of the whole congregation: and by this meanes he was cured, or rather excused of the shame of his disease. And this I know to be true by the relation of divers honest men of that parish. And truly, if one of the Jury had not been wiser then the other, she had been condemned thereupon, and upon other as ridiculous matters as this. For the name of a witch is so odious, and her power so feared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the common people, that if the honestest body living chance to be arraigned thereupon, she shall hardly escape condemnation.</p>

They are leane and deformed, shewing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy in their faces, to the horror of all that see them. They are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, scolds; mad, devillish; and not much differing from them that are thought to be possessed with spirits, so firme and steadfast in their opinions, as whosoever shall only have respect to the constancy of their words uttered, would easily beleeve they were true indeed.</p>
                  <p>These miserable wretches are so odious unto all their neighbours; and so feared, as few dare offend them, or deny them any thing they aske: whereby they take upon them, yea, and sometimes think, that they can do such things as are beyond the ability of humane nature. These go from house to house, and from door to door for a pot full of milke, yest, drinke, pottage, or some such releefe; without the which they could hardly live: neither obtaining for their service and paines, nor yet by their art, nor yet at the devils hands (with whome they are said to make a perfect and visible bargaine) either beauty, mony, promotion, wealth, worship, pleasure, honour, knowledge, learning, or any other benefit whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>It falleth out many times, that neither their necessities, nor their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation is answered or served, in those places where they beg or borrowe; but rather their lewdnesse is by their neighbours reproved. And further, in tract of time the witch waxeth odious and tedious to her neighbours; and they again are despised and despited of her: so as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times she curseth one, and sometimes another; and that from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the house, his wife, children, cattell, &amp;c. to the little pig that lieth in the stie. Thus in processe of time they have all displeased her, and she hath wished evill luck unto them all; perhaps with curses and imprecations made in forme. Doubtlesse (at length) some of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours die, or fall sick; or some of their children are visited with diseases that vex them strangely: as apoplexies, epilepsie, convulsions, hot fevers, wormes, &amp;c.

One sort (they say) can hurt and not helpe, the second can helpe and not hurt, the third can both helpe and hurt. And among the hurtfull witches he saith there is one sort more beastly than any kind of beasts, saving wolves; for these usually devoure and eat young children and infants of their own kind. These be they (saith he) that raise haile, tempests, and hurtfull weather; as lightning, thunder, &amp;c. These be they that procure barrennesse in man, woman and beast. These can throw children into waters, as they walke with their mothers, and

These can so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the minde of judges, they can have no power to hurt them. These can procure to themselves and to others, taciturnity and insensibility in their torments. These can bring trembling to the hands, and strike terror into the minds of them that apprehend them. These can manifest unto others, things hidden and lost, and foreshew things to come; and see them as though they were present.

                  <p>And first <hi>Ovid</hi> affirmeth that they can raise and suppresse lightning and thunder, rain and haile, clouds and winds, tempests and earthquakes.

Some that they can transferre corn in the blade from one place to another. Some, that they can cure diseases supernaturally, flie in the air, and dance with devils. Some write, that they can play the part of <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubus,</hi> and contract themselves to <hi>Incubus</hi>; and so young prophets are upon them begotten, &amp;c. Some say they can transubstantiate themselves and others, and take the formes and shapes of asses, wolves, ferrets, cows, apes, horses, dogs, &amp;c. Some say they can keep devils and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the likenesse of todes and cats.</p>
                  <p>They can raise spirits (as others affirme) drie up springs, turne the course of running waters, inhibit the sun, and stay both day and night, changing the one into the other. They can go in and out at awger-holes, and saile in an egge shell, a cockle or muscel-shell, through and under the tempestuous seas. They can go invisible, and deprive men of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, and otherwise of the act and use of venery. They can bring soules out of the graves.

                     <p>A confutation of the common conceived opinion of witches and witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and how detestable a sinne it is to repaire to them for counsell or helpe in time of affliction.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt whatsoever is reported or conceived of such manner of witchcrafts, I dare avow to be false and fabulous (cosenage, dotage, and poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excepted:) neither is there any mention made of these kind of witches in the Bible. If Christ had known them, he would not have pretermitted to inveigh against their presumption, in taking upon them his office: as, to heale and cure diseases; and to work such miraculous and supernaturall things, as whereby he himselfe was specially knowne, beleeved, and published to be God; his actions and cures consisting (in order and effect) according to the power by our witch-mongers imputed to witches. Howbeit, if there be any in these dayes afflicted in such strange sort, as Christs cures and patients are described in the new testament to have been: we fly from trusting in God to trusting in witches, who do not only in their cosening art take on them the office of Christ in this behalfe; but use his very phrase of speech to such idolaters, as come to seeke divine assistance at their hands, saying; Go thy waies, thy son or thy daughter,<note place="margin">John 5, 6. Mark. 5.34.</note> &amp;c. shall do well, and be whole.</p>
                  <p>It will not suffice to disswade a witch-monger from his credulity, that he seeth the sequele and event to fall out many times contrary to their assertion; but in such case (to his greater condemnation) he seeketh further to witches of greater fame. If all faile, he will rather thinke he came an hour too late; than that he went a mile too far. Truly I for my part cannot perceive what it is to go a whoring after strange gods, if this be not.<note place="margin">To go to witches, &amp;c. is idolatry.</note> He that looketh upon his neighbours wise, and lusteth after her, hath committed adultery. And truly, he that in heart and by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maintained the sacrifice of the masse to be propitiatory for the quick and the dead, is an idolater; as also he that alloweth and commendeth creeping to the crosse, and such like idolatrous actions, although he bend not his corporall knees.</p>
                  <p>In like manner I say, he that attributeth to a witch, such divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as duly and onely appertaineth unto GOD (which all witch-monger do) is in heart a blasphemer, an idolater, and full of grosse impiety, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he neither go nor send to her for assistance.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>A further confutation of witches miraculous land omnipotent power, by invincible reasons and authorities, with disswasions from such fond credulity.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IF witches could do any such miraculous things, as these and other which are imputed to them, they might do them againe and againe, at any time or place, or at any mans desire: for the devill is as strong at one time as at another, as busy by day as by night, and ready enough to do all mischief, and careth not whom he abuseth. And insomuch as it is confessed, by the most part of witch-mongers themselves, that he knoweth not the cogitation of mans heart, he should (me thinks) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appear, unto honest and credible persons, in such grosse and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall forme, as it is said he doth unto witches: which you shall never heare to be justified by one sufficient witnesse. For the devill indeed entreth into the mind, and that way seeketh mans confusion.</p>
                  <p>The art alwaies presupposeth the power; so as, if they say they can do this or that, they must shew how and by what meanes they do it; as neither the witches, nor the witch-mongers are able to do. For to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action is required the faculty and ability of the agent or doer; the aptnes of the patient or subject; and a convenient and possible applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now the witches are mortall, and their power dependeth upon the analogy and consonancy of their minds and bodies; but with their minds they can but will and understand; and with their bodyes they can do no more, but as the bounds and ends of terrene sense will suffer: and therefore their power extended not to do such miracles, as surmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their own sense, and the understanding of others which are wiser than they; so as here wanteth the vertue and power of the efficient. And in reason, there can be no more vertue in the thing caused, than in the cause, or that which proceedeth of or from the benefit of the cause. And we see;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aristot. de. anima lib.</hi> 2. Acts. 8.</note> that ignorant and impotent women, or witches, are the causes of incantations and charmes; wherein we shall perceive there is none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if we will credit our own experience and sense unabused, the rules of phylosophy, or the word of God. For alas! What an unapt instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a toothles,<note place="margin">Why should not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill be as ready to helpe theef re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as a witch? <hi>L. mulfum. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is strange, that we should suppose, that such persons can worke such feates: and it is more strange, that we will imagine that to be possible to be done by a witch, which to nature and sense is impossible; specially when our neighbours life dependeth upon our credulity therein; and when we may see the defect of ability, which alwaies is an impediment both to the act, and also to the presumption thereof. And because there is nothing possible in law, that in nature is impossible; therefore the judge doth not attend or regard what the accused man saith; or yet would
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58850:20"/>
do: but what is proved to have been committed, and naturally falleth in mans power and will to do. For the law saith, that to will a thing unpossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is a signe of a mad-man, or of a soole, upon whom no sentence or judgement taketh hold. Furthermore, what jury will condemne, or what Judge will give sentence or judgement against one for killing a man at <hi>Berwicke</hi>; when they themselves, and many other saw that man at <hi>London,</hi> that very day, wherein the murther was committed; yea though the party confesse himselfe guilty therein, and twenty witnesses depose the same; But in this case also I say the judge is not to weigh their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which is weakened by law; and the judges authority is to supply the imperfection of the case, and to maintain the right and equity of the same.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that some other things might naturally be the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and cause of such calamities as witches are supposed to bring; let not us that professe the Gospel and knowledge of Christ, be bewitched to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that they do such things,<note place="margin">An objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> as are in nature impossible, and in sense and reason incredible. If they say it is is done through the devils helpe, who can worke miracles; why do not theeves bring their businesse to passe miraculously, with whom the devil is as conversant as with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Such mischiefes as are imputed to witches, happen where no witches are; yea and continue when witches are hanged and burnt: why then should we attribute such effect to that cause, which being taken away, happeneth neverthelesse?</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>Surely the naturall power of man or woman cannot be so inlarged, as to do any thing beyond the power and vertue given and ingrafted by God. But it is the will and mind of man, which is vitiated and depraved by the devill:<note place="margin">Miracles are ceased.</note> neither doth God permit any more, than that which the naturall order appointed by him doth require. Which naturall order is nothing else, but the ordinary power of God, powred into every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to his state and condition. But hereof more shall be said in the title of witches confessions. Howbeit you shall understand, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> few or none are throughly perswaded, resolved, or satisfied, that witches can indeed accomplish all these impossibilities: but some one is bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one point,<note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and inconstant.</note> and some are cosened in another, untill in fine, all these impossibilities, and many more, are by several persons affirmed to be true.</p>
                  <p>And this I have also noted, that when any one is cosened with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening toie of witch-craft, and maketh report thereof accordingly, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifiing a matter most impossible and false as it were upon his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as being overtaken with some kind of illusion or other (which il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions are right inchantments) even the selfe same man will deride the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58850:20"/>
likely proceeding out of another mans mouth, as a fabulous matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of credit. It is also to be wondered, how men (that have seen some part of witches cosenages detected, and see also therein the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of their own presumptions, and the folly and false-hood of the witches confessions) will not suspect, but remaine unsatisfied, or rather obstinately defend the residue of witches supernatural actions: like as when a jugler hath discovered the slight and illusion of his principal seats, one would fondly continue to thinke, that his other petty jugling knacks of legier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Finally, many maintain and cry out for the execution of witches, that particularly beleeve never a whit of that which is imputed unto them; if they be therein privately dealt withall, and substantially opposed and tryed in argument.</p>

So as these inquisitors added many fables hereunto, least they should seem to have done injury to the poor wretches, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and executing them for none offence. But fithens (saith he) the springing up of <hi>Luthers</hi> sect, these priests have tended more deligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the execution of them: because more wealth is to be caught from them: insomuch as now they deale so loosly with witches (through distrust of gaines) that all is seen to be malice, solly, or avarice that hath been practised against them. And whosoever shall search into this cause, or read the chief writers hereupon, shall find his words true.</p>
                  <p>It will be objected, that we here in <hi>England</hi> are not now directed by the Popes laws;<note place="margin">An obejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and so by consequence our witches not troubled or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the inquisitors <hi>Haereticae pravitatis.</hi> I answer, that in times past here in <hi>England,</hi> as in other nations, this order of discipline hath been in force and use; although now some part of old rigor be qualified by two severall statutes made in the first of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and 33 of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight. Neverthelesse the estimation of the omnipotency of their words and charmes seemeth in those statutes to be somewhat maintained, as a matter hitherto generally received; and not yet so looked into, as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58850:21"/>
that it is refuted and decided. But how wisely soever the Parliament-house hath dealt therein, or how mercifully soever the Prince beholdeth the cause: if a poor old woman, supposed to be a witch, be by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill or canon law convented; I doubt, some canon will be found in force, not onely to give scope to the tormentor, but also to the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to exercise their offices upon her. And most certain it is, that in what point soever any of these extremities, which I shall rehearse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, be mitigated, it is through the goodnesse of the Queens Majesty, and her excellent magistrates placed amongst us. For as touching the opinion of our writers therein in our age; yea in our country you shall see it doth not onely agree with forreign cruelty, but surmounteth it far. If you read a foolish pamphlet dedicated to the Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> by <hi>W. W.</hi> 1582. you shall see that he affirmeth,<note place="margin">W. W. his book prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Dom. 1582.</note> that all those <hi>torture</hi> are farre too light, and their rigor too mild; and that in that respect he impudently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clameth against our magistrates, who suffer them to be but hanged, when murtherers, and such malefactors be so used, which deserve not the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth part of their punishments. But if you will see more folly and lewdnesse comprised in one lewd book, I commend you to <hi>Ri.

In which respect <hi>Bodin</hi> commendeth much the <hi>Scottish</hi> custome and order in this behalfe: where (he saith) a hollow peece of wood or a chest is placed in the church, into the which any body may freely cast a little scroll of paper, wherein may be contained the name of the witch, the time, place, and fact, &amp;c. And the same chest being locked with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58850:22"/>
three severall locks are opened every fifteenth day by three inquisitors or officers appointed for that purpose: which keepe three severall keyes. And thus the accuser need not be knowne, nor shamed with the reproch of slander or malice to his poor neighbour.</p>
                  <p>Item, there must be great perswasions used to all men, women, and and children, to accuse old women of witch-craft.</p>
                  <p>Item, there may alwaies be promised impunity and favour to witches, that confesse and detect others; and on the contrary, there may be threatnings and violence practised and used.</p>
                  <p>Item, the little children of witches, which will not confesse, must be attached, who (if they be craftily handled saith <hi>Bodin</hi>) will confesse against their own mothers.</p>
                  <p>Item, witches must be examined as suddenly, and as unawarres as is possible: the which will so amaze them, that they will confesse any thing, supposing the devill hath forsaken them; whereas if they should first be committed to prison, the devill would tamper with them, and informe them what to do.</p>
                  <p>Item, the inquisitor, judge, or examiner, must begin with small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters first.</p>
                  <p>Item, they must be examined, whether their parents were witches or no:<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Item, the examiner must look steadfastly upon their eyes: for they cannot look directly upon a mans face (as <hi>Bodin</hi> affirmeth in one place, although in another he saith, that they kill and destroy both men and beasts with their lookes.)</p>
                  <p>Item, she must be examined of all accusations, presumptions, and faults, at one instant; least Satan should afterwards disswade her from confession.</p>
                  <p>Item, a witch may not be put in prison alone, least the devill disswade her from confession, through promises of her indemnity. For (saith <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> some that have been in the goale have proved to fly away, as they were wont to do when they met with <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> &amp;c. and so brake their own necks against the stone wales.</p>

                     <p>Certain cautions against witches, and of their tortures to procure confession.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt to manifest their further follies, I will recite some of their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are published by the ancient inquisitors, for perpetual les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of their successors: as followeth.</p>
                  <p>The first caution is that, which was last rehearsed concerning weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the which (say they) is an infallible note.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the judge must beware she touch no Part of him, specially of his bare: and that he alwaies weare about his neck conjured salt, palme,<note place="margin">

                     </note> herbes, and wax hallowed: which (say they) are not only approved to be good by the witches confessions; but also by the use of the Romish church, which halloweth them onely for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mal. malef. pa.</hi> 3. <hi>quae.</hi> 15.</note>Item, she must come to her arreignment backward, to wit, with her taile to the judges face, who must make many crosses, at the time of her approching to the barre. And least we should condemne that for superstition, they prevent us with a figure, and tell us, that the same superstition may not seem superstitious unto us.<note place="margin">

                  <p>One other caution is, that she must be shaven, so as there remaine not one hair about her: for sometimes they keep secrets for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aciturnity, and for other purposes also in their hair, in their privities, and between their skinne and their flesh. For which cause I marvell they flea them no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </note> as M. Mal. reporteth; untill a charme written in a little scroll was espied to be hidden between her skin and flesh, and taken away. And this is so gravely and faithfully set down by the inquisitors themselves, that one may beleeve it if he list, though indeed it be a verity. The like ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Bodin,</hi> of a witch that could not be strangled by the executioner, do what he could.<note place="margin">

                     </note> But it is most true, that the inquisitor <hi>Cumanus</hi> in one year did shave one and fourty poor women, and burnt them all when he had done.</p>
                  <p>Another caution is, that at the time and place of torture, the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed things aforesaid, with the seven words spoken on the crosse, he hang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All which stuffe (say they) will so worke within and in them, as when they are racked and tortured, they can hardly stay or hold themselves from confession. In which case I doubt not but that Pope, which blasphemed Christ, and cursed his mother for a peacoke, and cursed God with great despigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58850:25"/>Another caution is, that after she hath been racked, and hath passed over all tortures devised for that purpose; and after that she hath been compelled to drink holy water, she be conveied again to the place of torture: and that in the middest of her torments, her accusations be read unto her; and that the witnesses (if they will) be brought face to face unto her: and finally, that she be asked, whether for triall of her innocency she will have judgement,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Candentis ferri,</hi> which is, To carry a certain weight of burning iron in her bare hand. But that may not (say they) in any wise be granted. For both M. <hi>Mal.</hi> and <hi>Bodin</hi> also affirm that many things may be promised, but nothing need be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for why, they have authority to promise, but no commission to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the same.</p>
                  <p>Another caution is, that the judge take heed, thar when she once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to confesse, he cut not of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> her examination, but continue it night and day. For many times, whiles they go to dinner, she return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to her vomit.</p>
                  <p>Another caution is, that after the witch hath confessed the annoying of men and beasts, she be asked how long she hath had <hi>Incubus,</hi> when she renounced the faith, and made the reall league, and what that league is, &amp;c. And this is indeed the cheef cause of all their incredible &amp; impossible confessions: for upon the rack, when they have once begun to ly, they will say what the torment or list.</p>
                  <p>The last caution is, that if she will not confesse, she be had to some strong castle or goale. And after certain daies, the jayler must make her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve he goeth forth into some farre country: and then some of her friends must come in to her, and promise her, that if she will confesse to them, they will suffer her to escape out of prison:<note place="margin">

                  <p>And in this place it may not be omitted, that above all other times, they confesse upon <hi>frydaies.</hi> Now saith <hi>Iames Sprenger,</hi> and <hi>Henry In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitor,</hi> we must say all, to wit: If she confesse nothing, she should be dismissed by law; and yet by order she may in no wise be bailed, but must be put into close prison, and there be talked withall by some crafty person, those are the words, and in the mean while there must be some eves-dropers with pen and inke behind the wall, to harken and note what she confesseth: or else some of her old companions and acquaintance may come in and talke with her of old matters, and so by eves-droppers be also bewraied; so as there shall be no end of torture before she have confessed what they will.</p>

                     <p>A refutation of the former surmised crimes patched together by Bodin, and the onely way to escape the inquisitors hands.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IF more ridiculous or abhominable crimes could have been invented, these poor women (whose chief fault is that they are scolds) should have been charged with them.</p>
                  <p>In this libell you do see is contained all that witches are charged with; and all that also, which any witch-monger surmiseth, or in malice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth unto witches power and practise.</p>
                  <p>Some of these crimes may not onely be in the power and will of a witch, but may be accomplished by naturall meanes: and therefore by them the matter in question is not decided,<note place="margin">The questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie: that is to say, the proposition or theme.</note> to wit; whether a witch can work wonders supernaturally; For many a knave and whore doth more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly put in execution those lewd actions, than such as are called witches and are handged for their labour.</p>
                  <p>Some of these crimes also laid unto witches charge, are by me denyed, and by them cannot be proved to be true, or committed by any one witch. Othersome of these crimes likewise are so absurd, supernaturall, and impossible, that they are derided almost of all men, and as false, fond, and fabulous reports condemned: insomuch as the very witch-mongers themselves are tashamed to hear of them.</p>
                  <p>If part be untrue, why may not the residue be thought false: For all these things are laid to their charge at one instant, even by the greatest doctors and patrones of the sect of witch-mongers, producing as many proofs for witches supernaturall and impossible actions, as for the other.

Be it as thou sayest, doest thou not frustrate the grace of Gods ordinance; namely baptisme? Are the words in baptisme spoken in vaine? Or shall the devill remaine in the child, or it in the power of the devill, being there and then consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ Jesus, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost?

                     <p>Of the private league, a notable tale of Bodins concerning a French-lady, with a confutation.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe manner of their private league is said to be,<note place="margin">The manner of witches private league with the devill.</note> when the devill invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and sometimes visible, in the middest of the people talketh with them privately; promising, that if they will follow his counsell, he will supply all their necessities, and make all their endeavours prosperous; and so beginneth with small matters: whereunto they consent privily, and come not into the fairies assembly.</p>
                  <p>And in this case (me thinks) the devill sometimes, in such externall or corporall shape, should meet with some that would not consent to his motions (except you will say he knoweth their cogitations) and so should be bewrayed. They also (except they were idiots) would spie him; and forsake him for breach of covenants. But these bargaines, and these as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies do all the writers hereupon maintaine; and <hi>Bodin</hi> confirmeth them with a hundred and odd lies; among the number whereof I will (for diverse causes) recite one.</p>
                  <p>There was (saith he) a noble Gentlewoman at <hi>Lions,</hi>

Her bed-fellow seeing the order hereof, lept out of his bed, took the candle in his hand, and sought for the Lady round about the chamber, and in every corner thereof; But though he could not find her, yet did he find her box of ointment:<note place="margin">This agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not with their interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that say, this is onely done by vertue of the league; nor yet to them that referre it unto words; quoth nota.</note> and being desirous to know the vertue thereof, besmeered himselfe therewith, even as he perceived her to have done before. And although he were not so superstitious, as to use any words to helpe him forward in his businesse, yet by the vertue of that oinment (saith <hi>Bodin</hi>) he was immediately conveyed to <hi>Lorreine,</hi> into the assembly of witches. Which when he saw, he was abashed, and said; In the name of God, what make I here? And upon those words the whole assembly vanished away, and left him there alone starke naked; and so was he said to returne to <hi>Lions.</hi> But he had so good a conscience, for you may perceive by the first part of the history, he was a very honest man, that he accused his true lover for a witch. And caused her to be burned. But as for his adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, neither, M. <hi>Mal.</hi> nor <hi>Bodin</hi> do once so much as speake in the dispraise thereof.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth throughout all <hi>Bodins</hi> booke, that he is sore offended with <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> and the rather as I suppose, because the said C. <hi>Agrippa</hi> recanted that which <hi>Bodin</hi> maintaineth, who thinketh he could worke wonders by magicke, and specially by his black dog. It shoud seem he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58850:31"/>
had pretty skill in the art of divination. For though he wrote before <hi>Bodin</hi> many a year,<note place="margin">C. <hi>Agrippa. cap.</hi> 51.</note> yer uttereth he these words in his book <hi>De vanitate scienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum</hi>: A certain French protonotary (saith he) a lewd fellow and a cosen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hath written a certain fable or miracle done at <hi>Lions,</hi> &amp;c. What <hi>Bodin</hi> is, I know not, otherwise than by report; but I am certain this his tale is a fond fable: and <hi>Bodin</hi> saith it was performed at <hi>Lions</hi>; and this man (as I understand) by profession is a civill lawyer.</p>

It is marvell that no penite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Me thinketh their covenant made at baptisme with God before good witnesses, sanctified with the word, confirmed with his promises, and established with his sacraments, should be of more force then that which they make with the devill, which no body seeth or knoweth. For God deceiveth none, with whom he bargaineth: neither doth he mocke or disappoint them, although he dance not among them.</p>
                  <p>The oath, to procure into their league and fellowship as many as they can (whereby every one witch, as <hi>Bodin</hi> affirmeth, augmenteth the number of fifty) bewrayeth greatly their indirect dealing.

But as well by their excuses and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies, as by other circumstances, I have tried and found all their trade to be meer cosening.</p>
                  <p>I pray you what bargain have they made with the devill, that with their angry lookes bewitch lambs, children, &amp;c? Is it not confessed, that it is naturall, though it be a ly?

                     </note> if their confession be made by compulsion, of force or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or by perswasion, and under colour of friend-ship, it is not to be regarded; because the extremity of threats and tortures provokes it; or the quality of fair word, and allurements constraines it. If it be volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, many circumstances must be considered, to wit; whether she appeach not her selfe to overthrow her neighbour, which many times happeneth through their cankered and malicious melancholike humor: then; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that same malancholike mood and frantick humor, she desire not the abridgement of her own dayes. Which thing <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes happen unto persons subject to malancholike passions: and (as <hi>Bodin</hi> and <hi>Sprenger</hi> say) to these old women called witches, which many times (as they affirme) refuse to live; threatning the judges, that if they may not be burned, they will lay hands upon themselves, and so make them guilty of their damnation.</p>
                  <p>I my self have known, that where such a one could not prevaile, to be accepted as a sufficient witnesse against himselfe, he presently went and threw himselfe into a pond of water, where he was drowned. But the law saith; <hi>Volenti mori non est habenda fides,</hi> that is; His word is not to be credited that is desirous to dy. Also sometimes (as else-where I have proved) they confesse that whereof they were never guilty; supposing that they did that which they did not, by meanes of certain circumstances. And as they sometimes confesse impossibilities, as that they fly in the air, transubstantiate themselves, raise tempests, transferre or remove corne, &amp;c. so do they also (I say) confesse voluntarily, that which no man could prove, and that which no man would guesse, nor yet beleeve, except he were as mad as they; so as they bring death wilfully upon themselves: which argueth an unsound mind.</p>

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I would wish that even in that case there be not too rash credit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor to hasty proceedings used against them: but that the causes, properties, and circumstances of every thing be duly considered, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently examined. For you shall understand, that as sometimes they confesse they have murthered their neighbours with a wish, sometimes with a word, sometimes with a look, &amp;c. so they confesse, that with

                  <p>In like manner they confesse, that with a touch of their bare hand, they sometimes kill a man being in perfect health and strength of body; when all his garments are betwixt their hand and his flesh.</p>
                  <p>But if this their confession be examined by divinity, philosophy, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, law or conscience, it will be found false and insufficient. First, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </argument>
                  <p>IF any man advisedly marked their words, actions, cogitations, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, he shall perceive that melancholy abounding in their head, and occupying their brain, hath deprived or rather depraved their judgements and all their senses: I meane not of cosening witches, but of poor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike women; which are themselves deceived. For you shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that the force which melancholy hath, and the effects that it worketh in the body of a man, or rather of a woman, are almost incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For as some of these malancholike persons imagine, they are witches, and by witch-craft can worke wonders, and do what they list: so do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, troubled with this disease, imagine many strange, incredible, and impossible things. Some, that they are Monarches and Princes, and that all other men are their subjects: some, that they are brute beasts: some, that they be urinals or earthen pots, greatly fearing to be broken: some, that every one that meeteth them, will convey them to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; and yet in the end hang themselves. One thought, that <hi>Atlas,</hi> whom the poets feigne to hold up heaven with his shoulders, would be weary, and let the skie fall upon him: another would spend a whole day upon a stage, imagining that he both heard and saw interludes, and therewith made himselfe great sport.

Now when the time approched that the devill should come, and take possession of the woman, according to his bargain, he watched and prayed earnestly, and caused his wife to read psalmes and prayers for mercy at Gods hands: and suddenly about mid-night, there was a great rumbling below under his chamber window, which amazed them exceedingly.

And yet I beleeve, if any mishap had insued to her husband, or his children; few witch mongers would have judged otherwise, but that she had bewitched them.

This was he that shot at a peny on his sonnes head, and made ready another arrow, to have slaine the Duke <hi>Remgrave</hi> that commanded it.

                  <p>And to prove that such bawdy doings betwixt the devil and witches is not fained, S. <hi>Augustine</hi> is alledged, who saith, that All superstitious arts had their beginning of the pestiferous society betwixt the divell and man. Wherein he saith truely; for that in paradise, betwixt the devill and man, all wickednesse was so contrived, that man ever since hath studied wicked arts: yea and the devill will be sure to be at the middle and at both ends of every mischief. But that the devill ingendreth, with a woman, in manner and form as is supposed, and naturally begetteth the wicked, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it true, nor <hi>Augustines</hi> meaning in this place.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit M.

If she be barren, then doth <hi>Incubus</hi> use her without decision of seed; because such seed should serve for no purpose. And the devill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voideth superfluity as much as he may; and yet for her pleasure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation together, he goeth to worke with her. But by the way, if the devil were so compendious, what should he need to use such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, even in these very actions, as to make these assemblies, conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, ceremonies, &amp;c. when he hath already bought their bodies, and bargained for their soules? Or what reason had he, to make them kill so many infants, by whom he rather loseth than gaineth any thing; because they are, so farre as either he or we know, in better case than we, of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per years by reason of their innocency?

This young man was willed by another witch, to go to her whom he suspected, and by fair or fowle meanes to require her helpe: who soon after meeting with her, intreated her faire, but that was in vain; and therefore he caught her by the throat, and with a towel strangled her, saying: Restore me my toole, or thou shalt dy for it: so as she being swolne and blacke in the face, and through his boisterous handling ready to dy, said Let me go, and I will helpe thee. And whilest he was losing the towell, she put her hand into his cod-peece, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the place; saying; Now hast thou thy desire: and even at that instant he felt himselfe restored.</p>

Whereupon he advised or rather injoyned the youth to go to the witch whom he suspected, and with flattering words to intreat her, to be so good unto him, as to restore him his instrument: which by that meanes he obtained, and soon after returned to shew himselfe thankfull; and told the holy father of his good successe in that behalfe: but he so beleeved him, as he would needs be <hi>Oculatus testis,</hi> and made him pull down his breeches, and so was satisfied of the truth and certainty thereof.</p>

Then went I unto an old woman, quoth the priest, who was said to be a cunning witch: and she willed me, that the next morning, about the dawning of the day, I should pisse, and immediately should cover the pis-pot; or stop it with my right netherstock, and before night the witch should come to visit me. And although, quoth he, the respect of mine orders somewhat terrified me from the execution of her advise; yet my necessities diverse waies, and specially my paines moved me to make triall of her words.

I marvel that no man useth this distinction in the definition of a man. But to what end should one dispute against these creations and recreations; when Bodin washeth away all our arguments with one word, confessing that none can create any thing but God; acknowledging also the force of the canons, and imbracing the opinions of such Divines, as write against him in this behalfe? Yea he doth now (contrary to himself elsewhere) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the devil cannot alter his form.<note place="margin">I. <hi>Bod. lib</hi> 2. <hi>de mag dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. cap.</hi> 6.</note> And lo, this is his distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Non essentialis forma (id est ratio) sed figura solum permutatur</hi>: The essentiall form (to wit, reason) is not changed, but the shape or figure.

                  <p>After three yeares vvere passed over, in a morning betimes he went to tovvne before his dame; vvho upon some occasion, of like to make vvater, stayed a little behind.

Which prodigious sight when certaine merchants of <hi>Genua</hi> espyed, and with wonder beheld; anon commeth the witch with a cudgell in her hand, beating forth the asse. And because, as it hath been said, such kinds of witchcrafts are very usuall in those parts, the merchants aforesaid made such meanes as both the asse and the witch vvere attached by the judge. And she being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and set upon the rack, confessed the vvhole matter, and promised that if she might have liberty to go home, she vvould restore him to his old shape: and being dismissed, she did accordingly.

                  <p>FhOr the maintenance of witches transportations, they object the words of the Gospell, where the devill is said to take up Christ, and to set him on a pinnacle of the temple,<note place="margin">Math. 4.8.

And againe, if it were by Gods speciall providence and appointment; then why should it not be done by the hand of God, as it was in the story of <hi>Iob</hi>? Or if it were Gods speciall purpose and pleasure, that there should be so extraordinary a matter brought to passe by the hand of the devill;<note place="margin">Job. 1.11.

this was done in a vision, and not in verity of action. So as they have a very cold pull of this place, which is the speciall peece of Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of them for their transportations.</p>

Many affirme very obstinately, that his body was truely and really as they say taken up: because they think it too great an indignity for Christ to be made subject to Satans illusions. But this objection is easily washed away. For it is no absurdity to grant all this to be wrought through Gods permission, or Christs voluntary subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: so long as we yeeld not to think that he suffered these temptations inwardly, that is to say, in mind or soul. And that which is afterwards set down by the Evangelist, where the devill shewed him all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world, and the glory of the same, and that to be done (as it is said in <hi>Luke</hi>) in the twinkling of an eye, doth more agree with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion than with a reall action.

                  <p>He that will say, that these words; to wit, that Christ was taken up, &amp;c. can hardly be applied to a vision, let him turne to the prophesie of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and see the selfe same words used in a vision: saving that where Christ is said to be taken up by the devill, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> is taken up, and lifted up, and carried by the spirit of God, and yet in a vision.

But the maintainers of witches omnipotency, say; Do you not see how really and palpably the devill tempted and plagued <hi>Iob</hi>? I answer first, that there is no corporall or visible devill named nor seen in any part of that circumstance; secondly, that it was the hand of God that did it: thirdly, that as there is no community between the person of a witch, and the person of a devill, so was there not any conference or practise between them in this case.</p>

Certainly the devill in this and such like cases is an instrument to worke Gods will, and not his own; and therefore it is an ignorant and an ungodly saying (as <hi>Calvine</hi> judgeth it) to affirme, that God doth but permit and suffer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: For if Satan were so at his own liberty (saith he) we should be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed at a sudden. And doubtlesse, if he had power to hurt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there were no way to resist: for he would come invisibly upon us, and knock us on the heads; yea he would watch the best and dispatch them, whilest they were about some wicked act. If they say; God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth him, no body impugneth them, but that God should give him leave, I say with <hi>Calvine,</hi> that the devill is not in such favour with God, as to obtaine any such request at his hands.</p>
                  <p>And whereas by our witch-mongers opinions and arguments, the witch procureth the devill, and the devill asketh leave of God to plague whom the witch is disposed:<note place="margin">I. <hi>Calvine in Iob. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>sermon</hi> 5. <hi>Mal. malef. pa.</hi> 1. <hi>quaest.</hi> 1. <hi>Idem part.</hi> 1. <hi>quaest.</hi> 4.</note> there is not (as I have said) any such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall communication between the devill and a witch, as witch-mongers imagine. Neither is God moved at all at Satans sute, who hath no such favour or grace with him, as to obtaine any thing at his hands.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>M.

If there had been any (say they) should have been there spoken of. As touching the authority of the book of <hi>Iob,</hi> there is no question but that it is very canonicall and authentike. Howbeit, many writers, both of the Jews and others, are of opinion, that <hi>Moses</hi> was the author of this book;<note place="margin">Note what is said touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the booke of Job.</note> and that he did set it as a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glasse before the people: to the intent the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> (of whose race he himselfe came) might know, that God shewed favour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were not of the same line, and be ashamed of their wickednesse: seeing an uncircumcised Painime had so well demeaned himselfe. Upon which argument <hi>Calvine</hi> (though he had written upon the same) saith, that forsomuch as it is uncertaine, whether it were <hi>Res gesta</hi> or <hi>Exempli gratia,</hi> we must leave it in suspense. Neverthelesse (saith he) let us take that which is out of all doubt; namely, that the holy ghost hath indited the book, to the end that the Jews should know that God hath had a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alwaies to serve him throughout the world, even of such as were no

Sometimes they are called witches in common speech that are old, lame, curst, or melancholike, as a nick-name. But as for our old women, that are said to hurt children with their eyes or lambs with their lookes, or that pull down the moon out of heaven, or make so foolish a bargain, or do such homage to the devill; you shall not read in the bible of any such witches, or of any such actions imputed to them.</p>

But that we may be througly resolved of the true meaning of this phrase used by <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 3. let us examined the description of a notable witch called <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> made by S. <hi>Luke.</hi> There was (saith he) in the city of <hi>Samaria,</hi> a certain man called <hi>Simon</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:58850:54"/>
which used witch-craft, and bewitched the people of <hi>Samaria,</hi> saying that he himselfe was some great man. I demand, in what other thing here do we see any witch-craft, than that he abused the people, making them beleeve he could worke miracles, whereas in truth he could do no such thing; as manifestly may appear in the 13. and 19. verses of the same chapter: where he wondered at the miracles wrought by the apostles, and would have purchased with money the power of the Holy Ghost to work wonders.</p>
                  <p>It will be said,<note place="margin">Acts 8, 11.</note> the people had reason to beleeve him, because it is written, that he of long time had bewitched them with sorceries But let the bewitched <hi>Galathians</hi> be a warning both to the bewitched <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> and to all other that are cosened or bewitched through false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or legierdemaine; least while they attend to such fables and lies, they be brought into ignorance, and so in time be led with them away from God. And finally, let us all abandon such witches and coseners, as with <hi>Simon Magus</hi> set themselves in the place of God, boasting that they can do miracles, expound dreames, foretell things to come, raise the dead,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 8.39.

And as for the unfaithfull, they shall have none other miracle shewed unto them, but the signe of <hi>Ionas</hi> the prophet.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I say, whatsoever they be that with <hi>Simon Magus</hi> take upon them to work such wonders, by sooth-saying, sorcery, or witch-craft, are but liers, deceivers, and coseners, according to <hi>Syrachs</hi> saying; Sorcerie, witch-craft, sooth-saying, and dreames, are but vanity, and the law shall be fulfilled without such lies.

And though we did command him many times, in the name of God, and of his son Jesus Christ, and in his mighty power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

charged him to tell us who sent him. And he said, I lay in her way like a log, and I made her runne like fire, but I could not hurt her. And why so, said we? Because God kept her, said he. When camest thou to her, said we? To night in her bed, said he. Then we charged him as before, to tell what he was, and who sent him, and what his name was. At the first he said, The devil, the devil. Then we charged him as before. Then he rored and cried as before, and spake terrible words; I will kill her, I will kill her; I will teare her in peeces, I will teare her in peeces. We said, Thou shalt not hurt her. He said, I will kill you all. We said, Thou shalt hurt none of us all. Then we charged him as before. Then he said, you will give me no rest. We said, Thou shalt have none here, for thou must have no rest within the servants of God: but tell us in the name of God what thou art, and who sent thee? Then he said he would tear her in peeces. We said, Thou shalt not hurt her. Then he said again he would kill us all. We said again, Thou shalt hurt none of us all, for we are the servants of God. And we charged him as before. And he said again, Will you give me no rest? We said, Thou shalt have none here, neither shalt thou rest in her, for thou hast no right in her, sith Jesus Christ hath redeemed her with his bloud, and she belongeth to him; and therefore tell us thy name and who sent thee? He said his name was Satan. We said, Who sent thee? He said, Old <hi>Alice,</hi> old <hi>Alice.</hi> Which old <hi>Alice,</hi> said we? Old <hi>Alice,</hi> said he. Where dwelleth she, said we?

Then we asked him, what she did give him. He said, her will, her will. What did she bid thee do, said we? He said, Kill her maid. Wherefore did she bid thee kill her, said we? Because she did not love her, said he. We said; How long is it ago, since she sent thee to her? More then a year, said he. Where was that, said we? At her masters, said he. Which masters, said we? At her master <hi>Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> at <hi>Kinington,</hi> said he. How oft wert thou there, said we? many times, said he. Where first, said we? In the garden, said he: Where the second time? In the hall: Where the third time? In her bed: Where the fourth time? In the field: Where the fift time? In the court: Where the sixt time? In the water, where I cast her into the mote: Where the seventh time? In her bed. We asked him again, where else? He said, in <hi>Westwell.</hi> Where there, said we? In the vicarige, said he.

                  <p>Gregory Neocaesariensis in his journy and way to passe over the Alpes, came to the temple of Apollo: where Apollo's priest living richly upon the revenues and benefit proceeding from that idoll, did give great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment unto Gregory, and made him good chear. But after Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory was gone, Apollo waxed dumbe, so as the priest's gaines decaied: for the idol growing into contempt, the pilgrimage ceased. The spirit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king compassion upon the priest's case, and upon his grief of mind in this behalfe, appeared unto him, and told him flatly, that his late guest Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory was the cause of all his misery. For (saith the devil) he hath banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, so that I cannot returne without a speciall license or pasport from him. It was no need to bid the priest make haste; for immediately he took post horses, and galloped after Gregory, till at length he overtook him, and then expostulated with him for this discourtesie proffered in recompence of his good cheare; and said, that if he would not be so good unto him, as to write his letter to the devil in his behalfe, he should be utterly undone. To be short, his importunity was such, that he obtained Gregory his letter to the devill, who wrote unto him in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and forme following, word for word: <hi>Permitto tibi redire in locum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed Lyra and Dionyfius incline greatly to the letter. And Lyra saith, that as when Balaam would have raised a devil, God interposed himselfe: so did he in this case bring up Samuel, when the witch would have raised her devil.

And therefore corpses in times past were accompanied and watched with lights, sprinkled with holy water, perfumed with incense, and purged with prayer all the while they were above ground: otherwise the serpent (as the masters of the Hebrews say) would devoure them, as the food appointed him by God, Gen. 3. alledging also this place; We shall not all sleepe, but we shall be changed; because many shall remaine for perpetuall meat to the serpent: whereupon riseth the contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Michael,</hi> concerning the body of <hi>Moses</hi>; wherein Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is alledged.<note place="margin">Jud. vers. 9.</note> I confesse that <hi>Augustine,</hi> and the residue of the doctors, that deny the raising of <hi>Samuel,</hi> conclude, that the devil was fetcht up in his likenesse: from whose opinions (with reverence) I hope I may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>

                  <p>AGaine, if the devil appeared, and not Samuel; why is it said in Eccl. that he slept? for the devil neither sleepeth nor dieth. But in truth we may gather, that it was neither the devil in person, nor Samuel: but a circumstance is here described, according to the deceived opinion and imagination of Saul. Howbeit Augustine saith, that both these sides may easily be defended. But we shall not need to fetch an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition so farre off: for indeed (me thinks) it is <hi>Longe petita</hi>; nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend so low as hell, to fetch up a devill to expound this place.

But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as we have liberty by S. Augustines rule, in such places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as seem to contain either contrariety or absurditie: to vary from the letter; and to make a godly construction agreeable to the word; let us confesse that Samuel was not raised, for that were repugnant to the word, and see whether this illusion may not be contrived by the art and cunning of the woman, without any of these supernaturall devises, for I could cite a hundred papistical and cosening practises, as difficult as this and as cleanly handled. And it is to be surely thought, if it had been a devil, the text would have noted it in some place of the story: as it doth not.

friend list: as appeareth in the lesson read in the popish church on Saint Cicilies day. Well, I perceive the woman of Endors spirit was a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and kept belike in her closet at Endor, or in the bottle, with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alices devil at Westwel, and are now bewraied and fled together to <hi>Limbo patrum, &amp;c.</hi> And though Saul were bewitched and blinded in the matter; yet doubtlesse a wise man would have perchance espied her kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Me thinks Saul was brought to this witch, much after the manner that doctor Burcot was brought to Feats, who sold master Doctor a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, whereby he thought to have wrought miracles,<note place="margin">D. Burcot. Feats.</note> or rather to have gained good store of money. This fellow by the name of Feats was a jugler, by the name of Hilles a witch or conjurer, everyway a cosener: his qualities and feats were to me and many other well knowne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected. And yet the opinion conceived of him was most strange and wonderfull; even with such and in such cases, as it grieveth me to think of; specially because his knavery and cosenage reached to the shedding of innocent bloud. But now forsooth Saul covereth himselfe with a net: and because he would not be knowne,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28 8.</note> he put on other garments. But to bring that matter to passe, he must have been cut shorter by the head and shoulders;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.13.</note> for by so much he was higher than any of the people. And therefore whatsoever face the crafty queane did set upon it, she knew him well enough. And for further proofe thereof, you may understand, that the princes of the Jews were much conversant with the people.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> And it appeareth manifestly, that Saul dwelt very neer to Endor, so as she should the rather know him; for in the evening he went from his lodging unto her house: neither should it seeme that she was gone to bed when he came. But because that may be uncertaine, you may see in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the text, that in a peece of the night he went from his house to hers, and with much ado intreated her to consent to his request. She finished her conjuration, so as both Sauls part, the witches part, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Samuels part was plaied: and after the solemnization thereof, a calfe was killed, a batch of bread baked, and a supper made ready and eaten up; and after all this, he went home the same night: and had need so to do, for he had some businesse the next day. By these and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumstances it may be gathered, that she dissembled, in saying, she knew him not,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> and consequently counterfeited, and made a foole of him in all the rest.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth there, that he, with a couple of his men, went to her by night, and said; conjecture unto me by thy familiar spirit, and bring me up whom I shall name unto thee. The godly-learned know, that this was not in the power of the witch of Endor, but in the God of heaven only to accomplish. Howbeit, Saul was bewitched so to suppose: and yet is he more simple that will be overtaken with the devises of our old witches, which are produced to resemble her. And why should we think, that God would rather permit the witch to raise Samuel, than that Dives could obt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine Lazarus to come out of Abrahams bosome, upon more likely and more reasonable conditions? Well now doth this strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet (according to the guise of our cosening witches and conjurers) make the matter strange unto Saul, saying, that he came to her in a snare, &amp;c.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58850:67"/>
But witches seldome make this objection,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.9.</note> saving when they mistrust that he which commeth to them will espie their jugling: for otherwise, where the witchmonger is simple and easie to be abused, the witch will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </note> that in <hi>Germany,</hi> since <hi>Luthers</hi> time, spirits and devils have not personally appeared, as in times past they were wont to do.

For in times past (saith <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> devils in vain shapes did intricate men with their illusions, hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in waters, stones, woods, &amp;c. But now that the word of GOD hath appeared, those sights, spirits, and mockeries of images are ceased. Truly, if all such oracles, as that of <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. (before the coming of Christ) had been true, and done according to the report, which hath been brought through divers ages, and from farre countries unto us, without priestly fraud or guile, so as the spirits of prophesie, and working of miracles, had been inserted into an idoll, as hath been supposed: yet we christians may conceive, that Christs coming was not so frutelesse and prejudicial in this point unto us, as to take away his spirit of prophesie and divination from out of the mouth of his elect people, and good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, giving no answers of any thing to come by them, nor by <hi>Vrim</hi> nor <hi>Thummim,</hi> as he was wont, &amp;c.

Whereat every one was astonied (as Epitherses affirmed.) And being in consultation what were best to do, Thamus concluded, that if the winde were high, they must passe by with silence; but if the weather were calme, he must utter that which he had heard. But when they came to Palodes, and the weather calme, Thamus looking out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the land, cried aloud, that the great god Pan was deceased: and immediately there followed a lamentable noise of a multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as it were with great wonder and admiration. And because there were many in the ship, they said, the same thereof was speedily brought to Rome, and Thamus sent for by Tiberius the Emperour, who gave such credit thereto, that he diligently inquired and asked, who that Pan was. The learned men about him supposed, that Pan was he who was the son of Mercurie and Penelope, &amp;c.

told so justly their patients dreames, or rather by their dreames their special diseases. Howbeit, physical dreames are natural, and the cause of them dwelleth in the nature of man. For they are the inward actions of the mind in the spirits of the braine, whilest the body is occupied with sleepe: for as touching the minde it selfe, it never sleepeth. These dreams vary, according to the difference of humors &amp; vapors.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THere are bookes carried about concerning this matter, under the name of Abraham, who (as Philo <hi>In lib. gigantum</hi> saith) was the first inventor of the exposition of dreames: and so likewise of Solomon and Daniel.

And as for the interpreters of dreams, as they know not before the dreame, nor yet after any ceatainty; yet when any thing afterwards happeneth, then they apply the dreame to that which hath chanced.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, there are diabolical dreames, which Nicholaus Hemingius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth into three sorts.

Secondly, when the devil sheweth revelations to them that have made request unto him therefore. Thirdly, when magicians by art bring to passe, that other men dreame what they will.

                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt if it be true that S. Augustine saith, and many other writers that witches nightwalkings are but phantasies and dreames: then all the reports of their bargaine, transporting, and meetings with Diana, Minerva, &amp;c. are but fables; and then do they ly that maintaine those actions to be done in deed and verity, which in truth are done no way. It were marvel on the one side (if those things happened in dreames, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse the witches affirme to be otherwise) that when those witches awake, they neither consider nor remember that they were in a dreame. It were marvel that their ointments, by the physicians opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons having no force at all to that effect, as they confesse which are inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors, should have such operation. It were marvel that their ointments cannot be found any where,<note place="margin">

It were marvel, that when a stranger is anointed therewith, they have sometimes, and yet not alwayes, the like operation as with witches; which all the inquisitors confesse.</p>
                  <p>But to this last, frier Bartholomaeus saith, that the witches themselves, before they anoint themselves, do heare in the night time a great noise of minstrels, which fly over them, with the lady of the fairies, and then they addresse themselves to their journy.<note place="margin">

                     <p>That most part of prophesies in the old Testament were revealed in dreams, that we are not now to look for such revelations, of some who have dreamt of that which hath come to passe, that dreams prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Nabuchadnezzers rule to know a true Expositor of Dreames.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is held and maintained by divers, and gathered out of the 12. of Numbers, that all which was written or spoken by the prophets, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the children of Israel (Moses excepted) was propounded to them by dreames. And indeed it is manifest, that many things, which are thought by the unlearned to have been really finished, have been only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by dreames and visions. As where Solomon required of God the gift of wisdome:<note place="margin">1 Ki. 3.5.15.</note> that was (I say) in a dream; and also where he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved promise of the continuance of the kingdome of Israel in his line. So was Esay's vision in the 6. of his prophesie: as also that of Ezechiel the 12. Finally,<note place="margin">1 Kings 9. Esay 6. Ezechiel 12. Jeremy 13.</note> where Jeremie was commanded to hide his girdle in the clift of a rock at the River Euphrates in Babylon; and that after certain daies, it did there putrefy, it must needs be in a dream; for Jeremy was never (or at least wise not then) at Babylon. We that are christians must not now slumber and dream, but watch and pray, and meditate upon our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ both day and night. And if we expect revelations in our dreams, now, when Christ is come, we shall deceive our selves: for in him are fullfilled all dreams &amp; prophesies.<note place="margin">

But he might have cited a thousand for one that fel out contrary: for as for such dreamers among the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as had not extraordinary visions miraculously exhibited unto them by God, they were counted couseners, as may appear by these words of the prophet Zacharie; Surely the idols have spoken vanity, and the soothsayers have seen a ly,<note place="margin">Zachary 10.2.</note> and the dreamers have told a vainthing. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Solomons saying;<note place="margin">Eccles. 5.6. Jeremy 23.</note> In the multitude of dreames and vanities are many words. It appeareth in Jeremie 23. that the false prophets, whilest they illuded the people with lies, counterfeiting the true prophets, used to cry out, Dreames, dreames; We have dreamed a dreame, &amp;c. Finally, Nabuchadnezzer teacheth all men to know a true expositor of dreames; to wit, such a one as hath his revelation from God. For he can (as Daniel did) repeate your dream before you discover it:<note place="margin">Daniel 21.</note> which thing if any expounder of dreames can do at this day, I will believe him.</p>

                  <p>How vainly, absurdly, and superstitiously the heathen used this kind of divination in their sacrifices, is manifested by their actions and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in that behalfe practised, as well in times past, as at this hour.

                  <p>AS touching the element of fire, and the superstition thereof about those businesses, you shall understand, that many superstitious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all nations have received, and reverenced, as the most holy thing among their sacrifices: insomuch (I say) as they have worshipped it among their gods, calling it Orimasda (to wit) holy fire, and divine light.

Surely they had heard of the fire that came downe from heaven, and consumed the oblations of the fathers; and they understood it to be God himselfe.

Some cause thereof (I suppose) was partly the translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of governments, whereby one nation learned folly of another; and partly blind devotion, without knowledge of Gods word: but specially the want of Grace, which they sought not for, according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and will.

                     <p>Of the Romane sacrifices: of the estimation they had of augury, of the law of the twelve tables.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Romans, even after they were growne to great civility, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a most flourishing state and common-wealth; would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sacrifice themselves, sometimes their children, sometimes their friends, &amp;c. consuming the same with fire, which they thought holy. Such estimation (I say) was attributed to that of divination upon the entrails of beasts, &amp;c. At Rome, the chiefe princes themselves exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the same; namely, Romulus, Fabius Maximus, &amp;c. insomuch as there was a decree made there, by the whole senate, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ix of the cheefe magistrates sonnes should from time to time be put forth, to learne the mystery of these arts of augury and divination, at Hetruria, where the cunning and knowledge thereof most abounded. When they came home well informed and instructed in this art, their estimation and dignity was such, as they were accounted, reputed, and taken to be the intrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the gods, or rather betweene the gods and them. No high priest, nor any other great officer was elected, but these did either absolutely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate them, or else did exhibit the names of two, whereof the senate must choose the one.</p>

For the masters of these faculties have ever taken upon them to occupy the place and name of God; blasphemously ascribing unto themselves his omnipotent power, to foretell, &amp;c. whereas, in truth, they could or can do nothing, but make a shew of that which is not.</p>
                  <p>One matter,<note place="margin">A manifest discovery of augurors cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senage.</note> to bewray their cousening, is; that they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver worke nor foreshew any thing to the poor or inferior sort of people: for portentous shewes (say they) alwaies concerned great estates. Such matters as touched the baser sort, were inferior causes; which the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of the people themselves would not neglect to learn. Howbeit, the professors of this art descended not so lowe, as to communicate with them: for they were priests (which in all ages and nations have been jolly fellows) whose office was, to tell what should come to passe, either touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good luck or bad fortune; to expound the minds, admonitions, warnings and threatnings of the Gods, to foreshew calamities, &amp;c. which might be (by their sacrifices and common contrition) removed and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifyed. And before their entrance into that action, they had many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, which they executed very superstitiously; pretending that every bird and beast, &amp;c. should be sent from the gods as foreshewers of somewhat. And therefore first they used to choose a clear day, and faire weather to do their businesse in: for the which their place was certainly assigned, as well in Rome as in Hetruria, wherein they observed every quarter of the element, which way to look, and which way to stand, &amp;c.

                  <p>THat which is forbidden in the Scriptures touching inchantment or witch craft, is not the wonderfull working with words. For where
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58850:91"/>
words have had miraculous operation, there hath been alwaies the special providence, power and grace of God uttered to the strengthening of the faith of Gods people,<note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> and to the furtherance of the gospel: as when the apostle with a word slue <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> But the prophanation of Gods name, the seducing, abusing, and cosening of the people and mans presumption is hereby prohibited, as whereby many take upon them after the recital of such names, as God in the scripture seemeth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to himselfe, to foreshew things to come, to worke miracles, to detect fellonies, &amp;c. as the Cabalists in times past tooke upon them, by the ten names of God, and his angels, expressed in the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to worke wonders: and as the papists at this day by the like names, by crosses, by gospels hanged about their necks, by masses, by exorcismes, by holy water, and a thousand consecrated or rather execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things, promise unto themselves and others, both health of body and soul.</p>
                  <p>But as herein we are not to imitate the papists, so in such things, as are the peculiar actions of God,<note place="margin">Ionas 1.</note> we ought not to take upon us to counterfeit or resemble him, which with his word created all things. For we, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the conjurors, Cabalists, papists, soothsayers, inchanters, witches, nor charmers in the world, neither any other humane or yet diabolicall cunning can adde any such strength to Gods workmanship, as to make any thing anew, or else to exchange one thing into another. New qualities may be added by humane art, but no new substance can be made or created by man. And seeing that art faileth herein, doubtlesse neither the illusions of devils, nor the cunning of witches, can bring any such thing truly to passe.

Indeed words of sanctification are necessary and commendable, according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule; Let your meat be sanctified with the word of God, and by prayer. But sanctification doth not here signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie either change of substance of the meate, or the adding of any new strength thereunto: but it is sanctified, in that it is received with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and prayer; that our bodies may be refreshed, and our souls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made the apter to glorifie God.</p>

The which lawes, with the executions and judicials thereupon, and the witches confessions, have beguiled almost the whole world.

Yea he saith that Galen (who indeed wrote and taught that <hi>Incantamenta sunt muliercularum figmenta,</hi> and be the onely clokes of bad physicians) affirmeth, that there is vertue and great force in incantations. As for example (saith Trallian) Galen, being now reconciled to this opinion, holdeth and writeth, that the bones which stick in ones throate, are avoided and cast out with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of charmes and inchanting words; yea and that thereby the stone, the chollick, the falling sicknesse, and all feavers, gowts, fluxes, fistula's, issues of blood, and finally whatsoever cure (even beyond the skill of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe or any other foolish physician) is cured and perfectly healed by words of inchantment. Marry M. Ferrarius (although he allowed and practised this kind of physick) yet he protesteth that he thinketh it none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise effectuall, than by the way of constant opinion: so as he affirmeth that neither the character, nor the charme, nor the witch, nor the devill accomplish the cure; as (saith he) the experiment of the toothach will manifestly declare, wherein the cure is wrought by the confidence or diffidence as well of the patient, as of the agent; according to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets saying.

                     <p>Of the effects of amulets, the drift of Argerius Ferrarius in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of charmes, &amp;c. foure sorts of Homericall medicines, and the choice thereof; of imagination.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS touching mine opinion of these amulets, characters, and such other bables, I have sufficiently uttered it else-where: and I will bewray the vanity of these superstitious trifles more largely hereafter. And therefore at this time I onely say, that those amulets, which are to be hanged or carried about one, if they consist of herbs, rootes, stones, or some other metall, they may have diverse medicinable operations; and by the vertue given to them by God in their creation, may worke strange effects and cures: and to impute this vertue to any other matter is witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft. And whereas A. Ferrarius commendeth certaine amulets, that have no shew of physicall operation; as a naile taketh from a crosse, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water, and the very signe of the crosse, with such like popish stuffe: I think he laboureth thereby rather to draw men to popery, than to teach or perswade them in the truth of physick or philosophie. And I think thus the rather, for that he himselfe seeth the fraud hereof; confessing that where these magical physicians apply three seeds of three-leaved grass to a tertian ague, and foure to a quartaine, that the number is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</p>

Of which sort of illusions he alleadgeth for example, how Philodotus did put a cap of lead upon ones head, who imagined he was headlesse, whereby the party was delivered from his disease or conceipt. Item another cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a woman that imagined, that a serpent or snake did continually gnaw and teare her entrailes; and that was done onely by giving her a vomit, and by foisting into the matter vomited a little serpent or snake, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which she imagined was in her belly.<note place="margin">The force of fixed fansie-opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or strong conceipt.</note>

                  <p>Item, another imagined that he alwaies burned in the fire, under whose bed a fire was privily conveyed, which being raken out before his face, his fansie was satisfied, and his heat allayed. Hereunto pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the hickot is cured with sudden feare or strange newes: yea by that meanes agues and many other strange and extreame diseases have been healed.

And when one had laid money with him thereabout, he commanded the asse to rise, but he lay still as though he were dead: then did he beat him with a cudgel, but that would not serve the turne, untill he addressed his speech to the asse, saying (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in open audience; The Sultan hath commanded, that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall ride out to morrow, and see the triumph, and that the faire la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies will then ride upon the fairest asses, and will give notable provender unto them, and every asse shall drink of the sweet water of Nilus: and then lo the asse did presently start up, and advance himself exceedingly. Lo (quoth his master) now I have wonne: but in troth the Major hath borrowed mine asse, for the use of the old ill-favoured witch his wife: and thereupon immediately he hung down his eares, and halted down right, as though he had been stark lame. Then said his master; I perceive you love young pretty wenches: at which words he looked up, as it were with joyful cheere. And then his master did bid him go choose one that should ride upon him; and he ran to a very handsome woman, and touched her with his head,<note place="margin">

Bodin saith, that this was a man in the likenesse of an asse: but I may rather think that he is an asse in the likenesse of a man. Well, to returne to our serpents, I will tell you a story concerning the charming of them, and the event of the same.</p>
                  <p>In the city of Salisborough there was an inchanter, that before all the people tooke upon him to conjure all the serpents and snakes within one mile compasse into a great pit or dike,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and there to kill them. When all the serpents were gathered together, as he stood upon the brinke of the pit, there came at the last a great and horrible serpent, which would not be gotten downe with all the force of his incantations: so as (all the rest being dead) he flew upon the inchanter, and clasped him in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, and drew him down into the said dike, and there killed him. You must think that this was a devil in a serpents likenesse, which for the love he bare to the poore snakes, killed the sorcerer; to reach all other witches to beware of the like wicked practise. And surely, if this be not true, there be a great number of lies contained in M. Mal. and I. Bodin. And if this be well weighed, and conceived, it beateth downe to the ground all those witchmongers arguments, that contend to wring witching mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles out of this place. For they disagree notably, some denying and some affirming that serpents may be bewitched. Neverthelesse, because in every point you shall see how popery agreeth with paganisme, I will recite certaine charmes against vipers, allowed for the most part in and by the church of Rome: as followeth.</p>

                  <p>Here is to be remembered, that many use to boast that they are of S. Pauls race and kindred, shewing upon their bodies the prints of serpent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereof though the last be but a bare jest, and to be done by any that will prove (as a bad fellow in London had used to do, making no tarrianc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But they that take upon them to worke these mysteries and miracles, do indeed (after rehearsall of these and such like words and charmes) take up even in their bare hands, those snakes and vipers, and sometimes p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But these charmers (upon my word) dare not trust to their charmes, but use such an inchantment, as every man may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully use, and in the lawfull use thereof may bring to passe that they shall be in security, and take no harme, how much soever they handle them: marry with a woollen rag they pull out their teeth before hand, as some men say; but as truth is, they weary them, and that is of certainty. And surely this is a kind of witchcraft, which I terme private confederacy. Bodin saith, that all the snakes in one countrey were by charmes and verses driven into another region: perhaps he meaneth Ireland, where S. Patrik is said to have done it with his holynesse, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>James Sprenger and Henry Institor affirme, that serpents and snakes, and their skins exceed all other creatures for witchcraft: insomuch as witches do use to bury them under mens thresholds, either of the house or stalles, whereby barrennesse is procured both to woman and beast: yea and that the very earth and ashes of them continue to have force of fascination. In respect whereof they wish all men now and then to dig

away the earth under their thresholds, and to sprinkle holy water in the place, and also to hang boughes (hallowed on midsummer day) at the stall doore where the cattel stand: and produce examples thereupon, of witches lies, or else their owne, which I omit, because I see my book groweth to be greater than I meant it should be.</p>

Helen, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of king Constantine, which diddest find the crosse whereupon Christ died: by that thy holy devotion, and invention of the crosse, and by the same crosse, and by the joy which thou conceivedst at the finding thereof, and by the love which thou bearest to thy sonne Constantine, and by the great goodnesse which thou doest alwaies use, that thou shew me in this christall, whatsoever I aske or desire to know; Amen. And when the child seeth the angel in the christal, demand what you will, and the angel will make answer thereunto. Memorandum, that this be done just at the sunne-rising, when the weather is faire and cleer.</p>

But the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgian made him pull off his kerchiefe, and willed him to drink with him freely. The sick man said he durst not; for he was forbidden by physick so to do. Tush (said this cunning man) they know not your disease; be ruled by me, and take in your drink lustily. For he thought that when he was well tippled, he might the more easily beguile him in his bargaine, and make his reward the greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he was to receive in part afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. When they had well drunk, he called the sick man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and told him the greatnes and danger of his disease, and how that it grew by meanes of withcraft, and that it would he universally spread in his house, and among all his cattel, if it were not prevented: and impudently perswaded the sick man to receive c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The sick man answered, that he had a daughter and a servant. The cousener asked how old his daughter was? The patient said twenty. Well (said the cousener) that is fit for our turn. Then he made the mother and father to kneel on their knees to their daughter, and to desire her in all things to obey the physician, and that she would do in every thing as he commanded her; otherwise her father could not be restored to his health. In which respect her parents humbly besought her on their knees so to do. Then he assigned her to bring him into his lodging her fathers haire, and her mothers, and of all those which he kept in his house, as well of men and woman, as also of his cattel. When she came therewith unto him, according to the match made, and her parents commandment, he lead her down into a low parlour, where having made a long speech, he opened a book that lay on the boord, and layeth thereon two knives acrosse, with much circumstance of words.<note place="margin">A pretended conjuration.</note> Then conjureth he, and maketh strange characters, and at length he maketh a circle on the ground, wherein he causeth her to stick one of those conjured knives; and after many more strange words, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her stick the other knife beside it.

Wherein the maid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loath to obey him, resisted, and in shame forbad that villainy. Then said the knave; Your fathers destruction is at hand: for except you will be ruled, he and all his family shall sustaine greater griefe and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then is yet happened unto him. And no remedy, except you will seeke his utter overthrow, I must have carnall copulation with you, &amp; therewithal sell into her, bosome, and overthrew her and her virginity.

And herehence sometimes proceedeth the cause, why butter commeth not, which when the countrey people see that it commeth not, then get they out of the suspected witches house, a little butter, whereof must be made three balls, in the name of the holy Trinity; and so if they be put into the chern, the butter will presently come, and the witchcraft will cease; <hi>Sic ars deluditur arte.</hi> But if, you put a little sugar or sope into the cherne, among the creame, the butter will never come; which is plaine witchcraft, if it be closely, cleanly, and privily handled.

Also, if they would induce love for the accomplishment of venery, they inscribe and expresse in the stones, amiable embracings and lovely countenances and gestures, words and kissings in apt figures. For the desires of the mind are consonant with the nature of the stones, which must also be set in rings, and upon foiles of such metals as have affinity with those stones, through the operation of the planets whereunto they are addicted, whereby they may gather the greater force of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>

When Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>T.

And because I am loath to be long in the description of circumstances, I will first describe the thing it selfe: which was a piece of earth of a good quantity, and most excellently proportioned in nature,<note place="margin">

If one had taken a piece of perfect steel, forked and sharpned at the end, and heated it red hot, offering therewith to have touched it; it would have fled with great celerity: and on the other side, it would have pursued gold, either in coin or bulloin, with as great violence and speed as it shunned the other. No bird in the air durst approach near it; no beast of the field but feared it, and naturally fled from the sight thereof. It would be hear to day, and to morrow twenty miles of, and the next day after in the very place it was the first day, and that without the help of any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

lie rest or stay here below on the earth, but alwaies laboureth to ascend up into the air. If one presse it down with his hand, it resisteth, and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth very sharply.

These two things last rehearsed are strange, and so long wondred at, as the mysterie and moralitie thereof remaineth undiscovered: but when I have disclosed the matter, and told you that by the lump of earth a man is meant, and some of his qualities described; and that that which was contained in the farre fetcht stone, was fire, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flame: the doubt is resolved, and the miracle ended.

                     <p>How men have been abused with words of equivocation, with sundry examples thereof.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>SOme have taught, and others have written certain experiments; in the expressing whereof they have used such words of equivocation, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many have been overtaken and abused through rash credulity: so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It is a common jest among the water men of the Thames, to shew the parish Church of <hi>Stone</hi> to the passengers, calling the same by the name of the lanterne of <hi>Kent</hi>; affirming, and that not untruly, that the said church is as light (meaning in weight and not in brightnesse) at midnight, as at noonday. Whereupon some credulous person is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and will not stick to affirm and swear, that in the same church is such continuall light, that any man may see to read there at all times of the night without a candle.</p>
                  <p>An excellent philosopher, whom (for reverence unto his same and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) I will forbear to name, was overtaken by his hossesse at <hi>Dover</hi>; who merrily told him, that if he could retein and keep in his mouth certain pibbles (lying at the shore side) he should not perbreak untill he came to <hi>Calice,</hi> how rough and tempestuous so ever the seas were. Which when he had tryed, and being not forced by sicknesse to vomit, nor to lose his stones, as by vomitting he must needs do, he thought his hostesse had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto him an excellent secret, nothing doubting of her amphibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall speech: and therefore thought it a worthy note to be recorded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong miraculous and medicinable stones; and inserted it accordingly into his book, among other experiments collected with great industry, learning, travell, and judgement. All these toies help a subtle cousener

Yea, to further estimation, many will whisper prophecies of their own invention into the ears of such as are not of quickest capacity;<note place="margin">A slender shift to save the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of their cunning.</note> as to tell what weather, &amp;c. shall follow. Which if it fall out true, then boast they and triumph, as though they had gotten some notable conquest; if not, they deny the matter, forget it, excuse it, or shift it off; as that they told another the contrary in earnest, and spake that but in jest. All these helps might <hi>Pharaohs</hi> jugglers have to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their cousenages and illusions, towards the hardening of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hearts.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto belong all manner of charmes, periapts, amulets, characters, and such other superstitions, both popish and prophane: whereby (if that were true, which either papists, conjurors, or witches undertake to do) we might daily see the very miracles wrought indeed, which <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians seemed to performe. Howbeit, because by all those devices or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senages, there cannot be made so much as a nit, so as <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> could have no help that way, I will speak thereof in place more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>

                     <p>How some are abused with naturall magick, and sundry exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thereof when illusion is added thereunto, of <hi>Jacobs</hi> pied sheep, and of a black Moore.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt as these notable and wonderfull experiments and conclusions that are found out in nature it self (through wisdome, learning and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry) do greatly oppose and astonish the capacity of man: so (I say) when deceit and illusion is annexed thereunto, then is the wit, the faith, and constancy of man searched and tryed. For if we shall yeeld that to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, supernaturall, and miraculous, which we cannot comprehend; a witch, a papist, a conjuror, a cousener, and a juggler may make us beleeve they are gods:<note place="margin">The inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding opinion, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver passeth our capacity, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, &amp;c.</note> or else with more impiety we shall ascribe such power and omnipotency unto them, or unto the devill, as only and properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to God. As for example. By consederacy or cousenage (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have said) I may seem to manifest the secret thoughts of the heart, which (as we learn in Gods book) none knoweth or searcheth, but God himself alone. And therefore, whosoever beleeveth that I can do as I may seem to do maketh a god of me, and is an idolater. In which respect, whensoever we hear papist, witch, conjuror, or cousener, take upon him more than lieth in humane power to performe, we may know and boldly say it is a knack of knavery; and no miracle at all. And further we may know, that when we understand it, it will not be worth the knowing. And at the discovery of these miraculous toies, we shall leave to wonder at them, and begin to wonder at our selves, that could be so abused with bables. Howbeit, such things as God hath laid up secretly in nature are to be weighed with great admiration, and to be searched out with such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, as may become a Christian man: I mean, so as neither God, nor

And (as some suppose) there were then a consort or crew of false prophets, which could also foretell things to come, and work miracles. I answer, it was extraordinary and miraculous, and that it pleased God so
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58850:127"/>
to try his people; but he worketh not so in these dayes; for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miracles is ceased.<note place="margin">The contrary effects that the miracles of <hi>Moses</hi> and the miracles of <hi>Egyptian</hi> magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians wrought in the heart of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                     </note> Likewise in this case it might well stand with Gods glory, to use the hands of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians, towards the harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Masters heart; and to make their illusions and ridiculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits to become effectuall. For God had promised and determined to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the heart of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> As for the miracles which <hi>Moses</hi> did, they mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified it so, as he alwayes relented upon the sight of the same. For unto the greatnesse of his miracles were added such modesty and patience, as might have moved even a heart of steel or flint. But <hi>Pharaohs</hi> froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse alwayes grew upon the Magicians actions: the like example, or the resemblance whereof, we find not again in the Scriptures. And though there were such people in those dayes suffered and used by God, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of his will and secret purpose: yet it followeth not, that now, when Gods will is wholly revealed unto us in his word, and his Son exhibited (for whom, or rather for the manifestation of whose coming all those things were suffered or wrought) such things and such people should yet continue. So as I conclude, the cause being taken away, the thing proceeding thence remaineth not. And to assign our witches and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers their room, is to mock and contemn Gods wonderfull workes; and to oppose against them cousenages, juggling, knacks and things of nought. And therefore, as they must confesse, that none in these dayes can doe as <hi>Moses</hi> did; so it may be answered, that none in these dayes can doe as <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> did: who, if they had been false Prophets, as they were Jugglers, had yet been more priviledged to exceed our old women or conjurors, in the accomplishing of miracles, or in prophecying, &amp;c. For who may be compared with <hi>Balaam</hi>? Nay, I dare say, that <hi>Balaams</hi> asse wrought a greater miracle, and more supernaturall, than either the Pope or all the conjurors and witches in the world can doe at this day.</p>
                  <p>To conclude,<note place="margin">That the art of juggling is more, or at least no lesse strange in working mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring, witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, &amp;c.</note> it is to be avouched (and there bee proofes manifest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) that our Jugglers approach much neerer to resemble <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, than either witches or conjurors, and make a more lively shew of working miracles than any inchantors can doe: for these practise to shew that in action, which witches doe in words and terms. But that you may think I have reason for the maintenance of mine opinion in this behalfe, I will surcease by multitude of words to amplifie this place, referring you to the tract following of the art of juggling, where you shal read strange pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises and cunning conveyances; which because they cannot so conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be described by phrase of speech, as that they should presently sinke into the capacity of you that would be practitioners of the same; I have caused them to be set forth in form and figure, that your understanding might be somewhat helped by instrumentall demonstrations. And when you have perused that whole discovery of Juggling, compare the wonders thereof with the wonders imputed to conjurors and witches, (not omitting <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Sorcerers at any hand in this comparison) and I beleeve you will be resolved, that the miracles done in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> sight by them, and the miracles ascribed unto witches, conjurors, &amp;c. may be well taken for false miracles, meer delusions, &amp;c. and for such actions as are commonly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by cunning jugglers; be it either by legierdemain, confederacy, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.</p>

                     <p>The art of juggling discovered, and in what point it doth principally consist.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOw because such occasion is ministred, and the matter so pertinent to my purpose, and also the life of witchcraft and cousenage so manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered in the art of juggling; I thought good to discover it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the rest of the other deceitfull arts; being sorry that it falleth out to my lot, to lay open the secrets of this mystery, to the hinderance of such poor men as live thereby:<note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects juggling is tolerable and also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.</note> whose doings herein are not only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, but greatly commendable, so they abuse not the name of God, nor make the people attribute unto them his power, but alwayes acknowledge wherein the art consisteth, so as thereby the other unlawfull and impious arts may be by them the rather detected and bewrayed.</p>
                  <p>The true art therefore of juggling consisteth in legierdemain; to wit, the nimble conveyance of the hand, which is especially performed three wayes.<note place="margin">The three principall points wherein legierdemain or nimblenesse of hand doth consist.</note> The first and principall consisteth in hiding and conveying of bals, the second in the alteration of mony, the third in the shuffling, of the cards.

thumb, betwixt your ring-finger and middle-finger, then are you to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise to doe it betwixt the other fingers, then betwixt the fore-finger and the thumb, with the fore-finger and middle-finger jointly, and therein is the greatest and strangest cunning shewed.<note place="margin">These feats are nimbly, cleanly and swiftly to be conveyed; so as the eies of the beholders may not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the drift.</note> Lastly, the same ball is to be practised in the palm of the hand, and by use you shall not only seem to put any one ball from you, and yet retain it in your hand; but you shall keep four or five as cleanly and certainly as one.

                  <p>Lay three or four bals before you, and as many small candlesticks, bols, saltsetter's or saltseller covers, which is the best. Then first seeme to put one bal into your left hand, &amp; therewithall seem to hold the same fast: then take one of the candlesticks, or any other thing (having a hollow foot, and not being too great) and seem to put the ball which is thought to be in your left hand, underneath the same, and so under the other candlesticks seem to bestow the other bals: and all this while the beholders will suppose each ball to be under each candlestickt this done, some charm or form of words is commonly used. Then take up one candlestick with one hand, and blow, saying; Lo, you see that is gone: and so likewise look under each can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick with like grace and words,<note place="margin">Memorandum that the juggler must set a good grace on the matter: for that is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite.</note> and the beholders will wonder where they are become. But if you, in lifting up the candlesticks with your right hand, leave all those three or four bals under one of them (as by use you may easily doe, having turned them all down into your hand, and holding them fast with your little and ring-fingers) and take the candlestick with your other fingers, and cast the bals up into the hollownesse thereof (for so they will not roll so soon away) the standers by will be much astonied. But it will seem wonderfull strange, if also in shewing how there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing under another of those candlesticks, taken up with your left hand, you leave behind you a great ball or any other thing, the miracle will be the greater. For first they think you have pulled away all the bals by miracle; then, that you have brought them all together again by like means, and they neither thinke nor looke that any other thing remaineth behind under any of them. And therefore, after many other feats done, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to your candlesticks, remembring where you left the great ball, and in no wise touch the same; but having another like ball about you, seem to bestow the same in manner and form aforesaid, under a candlestick which standeth furthest off from that where the ball lieth. And when you shall with words or charms seeme to convey the same ball from under the same candlestick and afterward bring it under the candlestick which you touched not, it will (I say) seem wonderfull strange.</p>

                  <p>But in shewing feats, and juggling with cards the principal point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in shuffling them nimbly, and alwaies keeping one certain card ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the bottome, or in some known place of the stock, four or five cards from it. Hereby you shall seem to work wonders; for it will be easie for you to see or spie one card, which though you be perceived to do, it will not be suspected,<note place="margin">Note.</note> if you shuffle them well afterwards. And this note I must give you, that in reserving the bottome card, you must alwaies (whilest you shufflle) keep him a little before or a little behind all the cards lying underneath him, bestowing him (I say) either a little beyond his fellowes before, right over the forefinger, or else behind the rest, so as the little finger of the left hand may meet with it: which is the easier, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyer, &amp; the better way. In the beginning of your shuffling, shuffle as thick as you can; and in the end throw upon the stock the neather card (with so many mo at the least as you would have preserved for any purpose) a little before or behind the rest. Provided alwaies, that your fore finger, if the pack be laid before, or the little finger, if the pack lie behinde, creep up to meet with the bottome card, and not lie betwixt the cards: and when you feel it, you may there hold it, untill you have shuffled over the cards again, still leaving your kept card below. Being perfect herein, you may do almost what you list with the cards. By this means, what pack soever you make, though it consist of eight, twelve, or twenty cards, you may keep them stil together unsevered next to the neather card, and yet shuffle them often to satisfie the curious beholders. As for example, and for brevity sake, to shew your divers feats under one.</p>

A chanon being an Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mister or cousener, espied a covetous priest, whose purse he knew to be well lined, whom he assaulted with flattery and subtill speech, two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall points belonging to this art. At the length he borrowed money of the priest, which is the third part of the Art, without which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors can doe no good, nor indure in good estate. Then he at his day repayed the money, which is the most difficult point in this art, and a rare experiment. Finally, to requite the priests courtesie, he promised into him such instructions, as whereby with expedition he should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come infinitely rich, and all through this art of multiplication. And this is the most common point in this science; for herein they must be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full before they can be famous, or attain to any credit. The priest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked not his proffer; specially because it tended to his profit, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced his courtesie. Then the chanon willed him forthwith to send for three ounces of quicksilver, which he said he would transubstantiate (by his art) into perfect silver.

And among other illusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tales concerning his owne commendation, for wealth, parents inheritance, alliance, activity, learning, pregnancy, and cunning, he boasted of his knowledge and experience in Alchymistry, making the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple man beleeve that he could multiply, and of one angell make two or three. Which seemed strange to the poor man, insomuch as he because willing enough to see that conclusion: whereby the Alchymister had more hope and comfort to attain his desire, than if his daughter had yeelded to have married him.<note place="margin">Note the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymisticall practitioner.</note> To be short, he in the presence of the said yeoman, did include within a little ball of virgine wax, a couple of angels; and after certain ceremonies and conjuring words he seemed to deliver the same unto him: but in truth (through legierdemain) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the yeomans hand another ball of the same scantling, wherein were inclosed many more angels than were in the ball which he thought he had received. Now (forsooth) the Alchymister <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And after certain dayes, hours, and minutes, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned together, according to the appointment, and found great gaines by the multiplication of the angels. Insomuch as he, being a plain man, was hereby perswaded, that he should not only have a rare and notable good sonne in law; but a companion that might help to adde unto his wealth much treasure, and to his estate great fortune and felicity. And to increase this opinion in him, as also to win his further favour; but especially to bring his cunnnig Alchymistry, or rather his lewd purpose to passe; he told him that it were folly to multiply a pound of gold, when as easily they might multiply a million: and therefore counselled him
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58850:144"/>
to produce all the money he had, or could borrow of his neighbours and friends; and did put him out of doubt, that he would multiply the same, and redouble it exceedingly, even as he saw by experience how he dealt with the small summe before his face.<note place="margin">A notable fool.</note> This yeoman in hope, of gains and preferment, &amp;c. consented to this sweet motion; and brought out and laid before his feet, not the one halfe of his goods, but all that he had, or could make or borrow any manner of way. Then this juggling Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mister, having obtained his purpose, folded the same in a ball, in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty farre bigger then the other, and conveying the same into his bosome or pocket, delivered another ball (as before) of the like quantity unto the yeoman, to be reserved and safely kept in his chest; whereof (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the matter was of importance) either of them must have a key, and a severall lock, that no interruption might be made to the ceremony, nor abuse by either of them;<note place="margin">

Now (forsooth) these circumstances and ceremonies being ended, and the Alchymisters purpose thereby performed; he told the yeoman that (untill a certain day and hour limited to returne) either of them might imploy themselves about their businesse and necessary affairs; the yeoman to the plough, and he to the city of <hi>London,</hi> and in the mean time the gold should mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, &amp;c. But the Alchymister (belike) having other matters of more importance came not just at the hour appointed, nor yet at the day, nor within the year: so as, although it were somewhat against the yeomans conscience to violate his promise, or break the league; yet partly by the longing he had to see, and partly the desire he had to enjoy the fruit of that excellent experiment, having (for his owne security) and the others satisfaction, some testimony at the opening thereof, to witnesse his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere dealing, he brake up the coffer, and loe he soon espied the ball of waxe, which he himselfe had laid up there with his owne hand. So as he thought (if the hardest should fall) he should find his principall: and why not as good increase hereof now, as of the other before? But alas! when the waxe was broken, and the metall discovered, the gold was much based, and became perfect lead.</p>

                  <p>So he caused the Kings name to be first set downe, and next him all the names of his privy councell.

Why (saith one of the councell) he may returne and performe his promise, &amp;c. Then (quoth the foole) I can help all the matter easily. How (said the King) canst thou doe that? Marry sir (said he) then I will blot out your name and put in his, as the most foole in the world. Many other practices of the like nature might be hereunto annexed, for the detection of the knavery and deceipts whereupon this art dependeth, whereby the reader may be more delighted in reading, than the practisers benefited in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply using the same.

wherein he proposeth one <hi>Balbine,</hi> a very wise, learned, and devout priest, howbeit such a one as was bewitched, and mad upon the art of Alchymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry. Which thing another cousening priest perceived, and dealt with him in manner and forme following.</p>
                  <p>M. Doctor <hi>Balbine</hi> (said he) I being a stranger unto you may seem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry saucy to trouble your worship with my bold suit, who alwayes are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied in great and divine studies.<note place="margin">A flattering and clawing preamble.</note> To whom <hi>Balbine,</hi> being a man of few words, gave a nodde: which was more then he used to every man. But the priest knowing his humour, said; I am sure sir, if you knew my suit, you would pardon my importunity. I pray thee good sir <hi>Iohn</hi> (said <hi>Balbine</hi>) shew my thy minde, and be brief. That shall I doe sir (said he) with a good will, You know M. Doctor, through your skill in Philosophy, that every mans destiny it not alike; and I for my part am at this point, that I cannot tell whether I may be counted happy or infortun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. For when I weigh mine owne case, or rather my state, in part I seem fortunate, and in part miserable. But <hi>Balbine</hi> being a man of some surlinesse, alwaies willed him to draw his matter to a more compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous forme: which thing the priest said he would doe, and could the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter performe, because <hi>Balbine</hi> himselfe was so learned and expert in the very matter he had to repeat, and thus he began.</p>
                  <p>I have had, even from my childhood, a great felicity in the art of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymistry, which is the very marrow of all Philosophy. <hi>Balbine</hi> at the naming of the word Alchymistry, inclined and yeelded himselfe more attentively to hearken unto him: marry it was only in gesture of body; for he was spare of speech, and yet he bad him proceed with his tale. Then said the priest, wretch that I am, it was not my luck to light on the best way: for you M. <hi>Balbine</hi> know (being so universally learned) that in this art there are two wayes, the one called Longation, the other Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and it was miue ill hap to fall upon Longation.<note place="margin">Longation and Curtation in Alchymistry.</note> When <hi>Balbine</hi> asked him the difference of those two wayes; Oh sir said the Priest, you might coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> me impudent to take upon me to tell you, that of all other are best learned in this art, to whom I come, most humbly to beseech you to teach me that lucky way of curtation. The cunninger you are, the more easily you may teach it me: and therefore hide not the gift that God hath given you, from your brother, who may perish for want of his desire in this behalf; and doubtlesse Jesus Christ will inrich you with greater blessings and endowments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Balbine</hi> being abashed partly with his importunity, and partly with the strange circumstance, told him that (in truth) he neither knew what Longation or Curtation meant; and therefore required him to expound the nature of these words. Well (quoth the priest) since it is your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I will doe it, though I shall thereby take upon me to teach him that is indeed much cunninger than my selfe.<note place="margin">Note how the cousener cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumventeth <hi>Balbine.</hi>
                     </note> And thus he began: Oh sir, they that have spent all the dayes of their life in this divine faculty, doe turne one nature and form: into another, two wayes, the one is very brief, but somewhat dangerous; the other much longer, marry very safe, sure, and commodious. Howbeit, I think my selfe most unhappy that have spent my time and travel in that way which utterly misliketh me, and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58850:146"/>
never could get any one to shew me the other that I so earnestly desire. And now I come to your worship, whom I know to be wholly learned and expert herein, hoping that you will (for charities sake) comfort your brother, whose felicity and well doing now resteth only in your hands; and therefore I beseech you relieve me with your counsell.</p>
                  <p>By these and such other words when this cousening varlot had avoided suspition of guile, and assured <hi>Balbine</hi> that he was perfect and cunning in the other way: <hi>Balbine</hi> his fingers itched, and his heart tickled; so as he could hold no longer, but burst out with these words: Let this Curtation goe to the devill, whose name I did never so much as once hear of before, and therefore doe much lesse understand it. But tell me in good faith, doe you exactly understand longation? Yea said the priest, doubt you not hereof: but I have no fansie to that way, it is so tedious. Why (quoth <hi>Balbine</hi>) what time is required in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of this work by way of longation? Too too much said the Alchymister, even almost a whole year: but this is the best, the surest and safest way,<note place="margin">Fair words make fooles faine, and large offers blind the wise.</note> though it be for so many moneths prolonged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it yeeld advantange for cost and charges expended thereabouts. Set your heart at rest (said <hi>Balbine</hi>) it is no matter, though it were two years, so as you be well assured to bring it then to passe.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it was there and then concluded, that presently the priest should goe in hand with the work, and the other should bear the charge, the gains to be indifferently divided betwixt them both, and the work to be done privily in <hi>Balbine</hi>'s house. And after the mutuall oath was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for silence, which is usuall and requisite alwaies in the beginning of this mysterie; <hi>Balbine</hi> delivered money to the Alchymister for bellowes glasses, coales, &amp;c. which should serve for the erection and furniture of the forge. Which money the Alchymister had no sooner fingered, but he ran merrily to the dice, to the alebouse, and to the stewes, and who there so lusty as cousening sir <hi>Iohn</hi>: who indeed this way made a kinde of alchymisticall transformation of money. Now <hi>Balbine</hi> urged him to go about his businesse, but the other told him, that if the matter were once begun, it were halfe ended: for therein consisted the greatest diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                  <p>Well, at length he began to furnish the furnace, but now forsoeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> new supply of gold must be made, as the seed and spawn of that which must be ingendred and grow out of this work of Alchymistry. For even as a fish is not caught without a bait, no more is gold multiplied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some parcels of gold: and therefore gold must be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and groundwork of that art, or else all the fat is in the fire. But all this while <hi>Balbine</hi> was occupied in calculating, and musing upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt; casting by arithmetick, how that if one ownce yeelded fifteen, then how much gaines two thousand ownces might yeeld: for so much he determined to employ that way.</p>
                  <p>When the Alchymist had also consumed this mony, shewing great travell a moneth or twain, in placing the bellowes, the coales, and such other stuffe, and no whit of profit proceeding or comming thereof. <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine</hi> demanded how the world went, our Alchymist was as a man amazed.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58850:146"/>
Howbeit he said at length; forsooth even as such matters of importance commonly doe goe forward, whereunto there is alwaies very difficult accesse. There was (saith he) a fault (which I have now found out) in the choyce of the coales, which were of oake, and should have been of beech. One hundreth duckets were spent that way, so as the dicing house and the stewes were partakers of <hi>Balbines</hi> charges. But after a new sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of money, better coales were provided, and matters more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly handled. Howbeit, when the forge had travelled long, and brought forth nothing,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Balbine</hi> was bewitched with desire of gold, &amp;c.</note> there was was another excuse found out; to wit that the glasses were not tempered as they ought to have been. But the more money was disbursed hereabouts, the worse willing was <hi>Balbine</hi> to give over, according to the dicers vein, whom fruitlesse hope bringeth into a fooles paradise.</p>
                  <p>The Alchymist, to cast a good colour upon his knavery, took on like a man moonsick, and protested with great words full of forgery and lies, that he never had such luck before. But having found the errour, he would be sure enough never hereafter to fall into the like oversight, and that hence forward all should be safe and sure, and throughly recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the end, with large increase. Hereupon the workhouse is now the third time repaired, and a new supply yet once againe put into the Alchymists hand; so as the glasses were changed.

such as the opportunity offered; to wit, to leap out at a back window; which he did,<note place="margin">The mildest and softest na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly soonest abused.</note> not without great hazard, and some hurt. But this was soon blazed abroad, so as it came to <hi>Balbines</hi> ear, who shewed in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that he had heard hereof, though he said nothing. But the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymister knew him to be devout, and somewhat superstitious; and such men are easie to be intreated to forgive, how great soever the fault be, and devised to open the matter in manner and forme following.</p>
                  <p>O Lord (saith he before <hi>Balbine</hi>) how infortunately goeth our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse forward! I marvell what should be the cause. Whereat <hi>Balbine,</hi> being one otherwise that seemed to have vowed silence, took occasion to speak, saying; it is not hard to know the impediment and stop hereof: for it is sinne that hindereth this matter; which is not to be dealt in but with pure hands. Whereat the Alchymister fell upon hisknees, beating his brest, and lamentably cryed, saying; Oh master <hi>Balbine,</hi> you say most truly, it is sinne that hath done us all this displeasure, not your sinne sir, but mine owne, good master <hi>Balbine.</hi> Neither will I be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to discover my filthinesse unto you, as unto a must holy and ghostly father. The infirmity of the flesh had overcome me, and the Devill had caught me in his snare. Oh wretch that I am! Of a Priest I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an adulterer. Howbeit, the money that erst while was sent to our Lady, was not utterly lost; for if she had not been, I had certainly been slain. For the good man of the house brake open the door, and the window was lesse than I could get out thereat. And in that extremity of danger it came into my minde to fall down prostrate to the virgine; beseeching her (if our gift were acceptable in her sight) that she would, in consideration thereof, assist me with her help. And to be short, I ran to the window,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>En immensae cavi sperant mendacia solles.</hi>
                     </note> and found it big enough to leap out at. Which thing <hi>Balbine</hi> did not only beleeve to be true, but in respect thereof forgave him, religiously admonishing him to shew himself thankfull to that pitiful and blessed Lady.</p>
                  <p>Now once again more is made a new supply of money, and mutuall promise made to handle this divine matter hence forward purely and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily. To be short, after a great number of such parts played by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymister; one of <hi>Balbine</hi>'s acquaintance espied him, that knew him from his childehood to be but a cousening merchant; and told <hi>Balbine</hi> what he was, &amp; that he would handle him in the end, even as he had used many others; for a knave he ever was, and so he would prove. But what did <hi>Balbine,</hi>

And as for the knave Alchymister, he need not care who knew it, or what came of it; for he had nothing in goods or fame to be lost. And as for his cunning in Alchymistry, he had as much as an asse. By this discourse <hi>Erasmus</hi> would give us to note, that under the golden name of Alchymistry there lyeth lurking no small calamitie; wherein there be such severall shifts and suits of rare subtleties and deceipts, as that not only wealthy men are thereby many times impoverished, and that with the sweet allurement of this art, through their owne covetousnesse;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58850:148"/>
as also by the flattering baits of hoped gain: but even wise and learned men hereby are shamefully overshot, partly for want of due experience in the wiles and subtleties of the world, and partly through the softnesse and pliablenesse of their good nature, which cousening knaves doe common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuse to their owne lust and commodity, and to the others utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</p>

                  <p>An ancient writer of a religious order, who lived above a thousand years since, discovering the diversities of thefts, after a long enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Alchymisters, whom he calleth <hi>Falsificantes metallorum &amp; mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralium,</hi> witches and counterfeiters of metals and minerals; and setteth
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58850:148"/>
them as deep in the degree of theeves, as any of the rest, whose inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dealings are brought to open arreignment. It is demanded (saith he) why the art of Alchymistry doth never prove that in effect, which it pretendeth in precept and promise. The answer is ready; that if by art gold might be made, then were it behoovefull to know the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and proceeding of nature in generation; sith art is said to imitate and counterfeit nature.<note place="margin">No certain ground in the art Alchymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall.</note> Againe, it is because of the lamenesse and unperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of phylosophy, specially concerning minerals no such manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding being set down by consent and agreement of philosophers in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, touching the true and undoubted effect of the same. Whereupon one supposeth that gold is made of one kind of stuffe this way, others of another kind of stuffe that way. And therefore it is a chance if any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the artificiall applying of the actives and passives of gold and silver. Moreover, it is certain, that quicksilver and sulphur are the materials (as they terme them) of metals, and the agent is heat, which directeth; howbeit it is very hard to know the due proportion of the mixture of the materials; which proportion the generation of gold doth require. And admit that by chance they attaine to such proportion; yet can they not readily resume or doe it again in another work, because of the hidden diversities of materials, and the uncertainty of applying the actives and passives.</p>

The king oftentimes, by means of his game, used the countrymans house for his refreshing; and as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men sometimes take pleasure in homely and course things, so the King did not refuse to eat turnips and rape roots in <hi>Conons</hi> cotage.

But <hi>Conons</hi> wife overcame him, and perswaded him in the end, choosing a certaine number of the best and goodliest rape roots that she had: which when she had given her husband to carry to the court, he set forward on his journey a good trudging pace. But <hi>Conon</hi> being tempted by the way, partly with the desire of eating,<note place="margin">A hungry bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will not be bridled.</note> and partly with the toothsomenesse of the meat which he bare, that by little and little he devoured up all the roots saving one, which was a very fair and a goodly great one indeed. Now when <hi>Conon</hi> was come to the court, it was his luck to stand in such a place, as the King passing by, and spying the man, did well remember him, and commanded that he should be brought in. <hi>Conon</hi> v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King received it with more cheerfulnesse than it was offered, and bad one of those that stood next him, to take it, and lay it up among those things which he esteemed most, and had in greatest accompt. Then he bad <hi>Canon</hi> to dine with him, and after dinner gave the countryman great thanks for his rape root; who made no bones of the matter,<note place="margin">A princely largesse.</note> but boldly made challenge and claim to the Kings promised cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie. Whereupon the King commanded, that a thousand crownes should be given him in recompense for his root.</p>
                  <p>The report of this bountifulnesse was spread in short space over all the kings houshold: in so much as one of his courtiers, in hope of the like or a larger reward gave the king a very proper gennet. Whose drift the King perceiving, and judging that his former liberality to the clowne, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the courtier to this covetous attempt, took the gennet very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: and calling some of his noblemen about him, began to consult with them, what mends he might make his servant for his horse. Whiles this was a doing, the courtier conceived passing good hope of some princely largesse, calculating and casting his cards in this manner; If his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty rewarded a silly clown so bountifully for a simple rape root, what will he do to a jolly courtier for a gallant gennet? Whiles the King was debating the matter, and one said this, another that, and the courtier travelled all the while in vain hope, at last saith the King, even upon the sudden; I have now bethought me what to bestow upon him: and calling one of his nobles to him, whispered him in the eare, and willed him to fetch a thing,<note place="margin">

The cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier was a glad man, and at his departing longed to be looking what it was, and his heart danced for joy. In due time therefore he unwrapped the silk (a sort of his fellow courtiers flocking about him to testifie his good luck) and having unfolded it, he found therein a dry and withered rape root. Which spectacle though it set the standers about in a loud laughter, yet it quailed the courtiers courage, and cast him into a shrewd fit of pensivenesse. Thus was the confidence of this courtier turned to vanity, who upon hope of good speed was willing to part from his horse for had I wist.</p>

residue of their proceedings may be judged, or rather detected. For if we seriously behold the matter of conjuration, and the drift of conjurors, we shall finde them, in mine opinion, more faulty then such as take upon them to be witches, as manifest offenders against the majesty of God, and his holy law, and as apparent violators of the laws and quietnesse of this realm: although indeed they bring no such thing to passe, as is surmised and urged by c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Well, when they have gotten them up, they shut them in a circle made with chalk, which is so strongly beset and invironed with crosses and names, that they cannot for their lives get out; which is a very probable matter.<note place="margin">An ironicall confutation.</note> Then can they bind them and loose them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and make them that have been lyers from the beginning, to tell the truth, yea they can compell them to doe any thing. And the divels are forced to be obedient unto them, and yet cannot be brought to due obedience unto God their creator.

Ephes. 5. Psal. 72 &amp; 78.</note> With faigned words they make merchandize of you. And therefore the counsell is good that <hi>Paul</hi> giveth us, when he biddeth us take heed that no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us with vain words. For it is the Lord only that worketh great wonders,<note place="margin">Sap. 16. Eccles. 43.</note> and bringeth mighty things to passe.

                  <p>But put case the Divell could be fetched up and fettered, and loosed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at their pleasure &amp;c. I marvell yet, that any can be so bewitched as to be made to beleeve, that by vertue of their words, any earthly creature can be made invisible. We think it a lye to say that white is black; and black white; but it is a more shamelesse assertion to affirm, that white is not, or black is not at all; and yet more impudency to hold that
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58850:173"/>
a man is a horse; but most apparent impudency to say, that a man is no man, or to be extenuated into such a quantity, as thereby he may be invisible, and yet remain in life and health, and that in the cleare light of the day, even in the presence of them that are not blinde. But surely he that cannot make one haire white or black, whereof (on the other side) not one falleth from the head without Gods-speciall providence, can never bring to passe, that the visible creature of God shall become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or lose the vertue and grace powred thereinto by God the creator of all things.</p>
                  <p>If they say that the divell covereth them with a cloud or veil,<note place="margin">Ezek. 8 &amp; 9. Isa. 6. &amp; 26. &amp; 30.</note> as <hi>M. Mal.

And though perchance they say in their hearts; Tush, the Lord seeth not, who indeed have blinded them, so as seeing, they see not; yet they shall never be able to perswade the wise, but that both God and man doth see both them and their knavery in this behalf.

thereof also must the seven psalmes be said, and the Gospell of St. <hi>Iohn.</hi> Then there must be a crosse and a censer with frankincense, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall the place must be censed or perfumed, holy water must be sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and a holy stoal must be used, and (after divers other ceremonies) a prayer to God must be made, in manner and form following.</p>
                  <p>O Lord Jesus Christ, the knower of all secrets, which alwayes revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest all wholesome and profitable things to thy faithfull children, and which sufferest a spirit to shew himself in this place, wee beseech thee for thy bitter passion, &amp;c. vouchsafe to command this spirit, to reveale and signifie unto us thy servants, without our terrour or hurt, what hee is, to thine honour, and to his comfort; <hi>In nomine patris, &amp;c.</hi> And then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in these words.

                     <p>A late experiment or cousening conjuration practised at Orleance by the Franciscan Friers, how it was detected, and the judgement against the authors of that comedy.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the year of our Lord 1534. at <hi>Orleance</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>

And because she was buried in the church of the <note n="*" place="margin">Of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der read noble stuffe in a book printed at <hi>Frankeford</hi> under the title of <hi>Alcoran.

                     <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans,</hi> besides her Father and Grandfather, and gave them in reward only six crownes, whereas they hoped for a greater prey; shortly after it chanced, that as he felled certain woods and sold them, they desired to give them some part thereof freely without mony; which he flatly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This they took very grievously. And whereas before they misliked him, now they conceived such displeasure as they devised this means to be revenged; to wit, that his wife was damned for ever. The chiefe workmen and framers of this tragedy were <hi>Colimannus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbatensis,</hi> both Doctors of Divinity; this <hi>Colimannus</hi> was a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juror, and had all his implements in a readinesse, which hee was wont to use in such businesse. And thus they handle the matter. They place over the arches of the church a young novice;<note place="margin">Note how the Franciscans cannot conjure without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate.</note> who about midnight when they came to mumble their prayers, as they were wont to doe, maketh a great rumbling, and noise. Out of hand the Monks began to conjure and to charm, but he answered nothing. Then being required to give a signe, whether he were a dum spirit or no, he began to rumble againe; which thing they took as a certaine signe. Having laid this foundation, they goe unto certain citizens, chief men, and such as favoured them, declaring that a heavy chance had happened at home in their monastery; not shewing what the matter was, but desiring them to come to their mattens at midnight.<note place="margin">O notorious impudency! with such shamelesse fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to abuse so worshipfull a company.</note> When these citizens were come, and that prayers were begun, the counterfeit spirit beginneth to make a marvellous noise in the top of the church. And being asked what he meant, and who hee was, gave signes that it was not lawfull for him to speak. Therefore they commanded him to make answer by tokens and signes to certaine things they would demand of him. Now was there a hole made in the vawt, through the which he might heare and understand the voice of a conjuror. And then had he in his hand a little board, which at every question he strake, in such sort as he might easily be heard beneath. First they asked him, whether he were one of them that had been buried in the same place. Afterwards they reckoning many by name, which had been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there; at the last also they name the Maiors wife: and there by and by the spirit gave a signe that he was her soule. He was further asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was damned or no; and if he were, for what cause, for what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert or fault; whether for covetousnesse, or wanton lust, for pride or want of charity; or whether it were for heresie, or for the sect of <hi>Luther</hi>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:58850:175"/>
newlie sprung up: also what he meant by that noise and stirre he kept there; whether it were to have the body now buryed in holy ground to be digged up again, and laid in some other place. To all which points he answered by signes, as he was commanded, by the which he affirmed or denyed any thing, according as he strake the board twice or thrice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And when he had thus given them to understand, that the <note n="*" place="margin">The confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate spirit was taught that lesson be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cause of his damnation was <hi>Luthers</hi> heresie, and that the body must needs be digged up againe: the monks requested the citizens, whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence they had used or rather abused, that they would bear witnesse of those things which they had seen with their eye; and that they would subscribe to such things as were done before. The citizens taking good advice on the matter, lest they should offend the Maior, or bring themselves in trouble, refused so to doe. But the monks notwithstanding take from thence the sweet bread, which they called the host and body of our Lord, with all the reliques of saints, and carry them to another place, and there say their masse. The Bishops substitute judge (whom they called O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficiall) understanding that matter, cometh thither, accompanyed with certaine honest men, to the intent he might know the whole circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance more exactly: and therefore hee commandeth them to make conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his presence; and also he requireth certaine to be chosen to goe up into the top of the vawt, and there to see whether any ghost appeared or not.<note place="margin">For so might the confederate be found.</note> 
                     <hi>Stephanus Aterbatensis</hi> stifflie denyed that to be lawfull, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellously perswading the contrary, affirmed that the spirit in no wise ought to be troubled. And albeit the Officiall urged them very much, that there might be some conjuring of the spirit; yet could hee nothing prevaile.</p>
                  <p>Whilest these things were doing, the Maior, when he had shewed the other Justices of the city, what he would have them to doe, took his journey to the king, and opened the whole matter unto him. And because the monks refused judgement upon plea of their owne laws and liberties, the king choosing out certain of the Aldermen of <hi>Paris,</hi> giveth them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and full authority to make enquiry of the matter. The like doth the Chancellor master <hi>Anthonius Pratensis</hi> cardinall and Legat for the Pope throughout <hi>France.</hi> Therefore when they had no exception to alleadge, they were co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>veyed unto <hi>Paris,</hi> and there constrained to make their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. But yet could nothing be wrung out of them by confession,<note place="margin">An obstinate and wilfull persisting in the denying or not confessing of a fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they were put a part into divers prisons, the novice being kept in the house of master <hi>Fumanus,</hi> one of the Aldermen, was oftentime exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and earnestly requested to utter the truth, but would notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confesse nothing; because he feared that the monks would afterward put him to death for staining their order, and putting it to open shame. But when the Judges had made him sure promise that he should escape punishment, and that he should never come into their handling, he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them the whole matter as it was done: and being brought before his fellows, avouched the same to their faces. The monks, albeit they were convicted, and by these means almost taken tardy with the deed doing yet did they refuse the Judges, bragging and themselves vaunting on their priviledges, but all in vain. For sentence passed upon them, and they were
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58850:175"/>
condemned to be carryed back again to <hi>Orleance,</hi> and thereto be cast inpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and so should finally be brought forth into the chiefe church of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty openly, and from thence to the place of execution, where they should make open confession of their trespasses.</p>
                  <p>Surely this was most common among monks and fryers, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their religion, their lust, their liberties, their pompe, their wealth, their estimation and knavery by such cousening practises.<note place="margin">A parecbasis or transition of of the author to matter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purposed.</note> Now I will shew you more speciall orders of popish conjurations, that are so shamelesly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the chuch of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they are not only suffered, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be used, not by night secretly, but by day impudently. And these forsooth concerning the curing of bewitched persons, and such as are posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to wit, such as have a divell put into them by witches inchantments.

But that is (saith <hi>M. Mal.</hi>) rather through the goodnesse and license of the Pope, than through the grace of the Sacrament.

Marry there were certain <hi>Pater nosters, Aves,</hi> and <hi>Credos</hi> said, and crosses made, but they are charmes, they say, and no conjurations.

                     <p>The seven reasons why some are not rid of the divell with all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish conjurations, why there were no conjurors in the primitive Church, and why the divell is not so soon cast out of the bewitched as of the possessed.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe reason why some are not remedied for all their conjurations, the papists say is for seven canses. First, for that the faith of the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> naught; secondly, for that theirs that present the party is no better; thirdly, because of the sins of the bewitched; fourthly, for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> neglecting of meet remedies; fiftly, for the reverence of vertues going <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> out into others; sixtly, for the purgation; seventhly, for the merit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the party bewitched.

That is to say, say they, the possessed or bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his sinnes. For by the neglect of due remedies it appeareth, that there were not with Christ good &amp; perfect men. For the pillars of the faith; to wit, <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were absent. Neither was there fasting and prayer, without the which that kind of divels could not be cast out. For the fourth point; to wit, the fault of the exorcist in faith may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58850:177"/>
for that afterwards the disciples asked the cause of their impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency therein. And Iesus answered, it was for their incredulity, saying that if they had as much faith as a graine of mustard seed, they should move mountaines, &amp;c. The fift is proved by <hi>Vitas patrum,</hi> the lives of the fathers, where it appeareth that S. <hi>Anthony</hi> could not do that cure, when his scholar <hi>Paule</hi> could do it, and did it. For the proofe of the sixt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it is said, that though the fault be taken away thereby; yet it followeth not that alwayes the punishment is released. Last of all it is said, that it is possible that the divell was not conjured out of the party before baptisme by the exorcist, or the midwife hath not baptized him well, but omitted some part of the sacrament. If any object that there were no exorcists in the primitive church, it is answered, that the church cannot now erre. And saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> would never have instituted it in vaine.<note place="margin">Why there were no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurors in the primitive church with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther subtill points.</note> And it is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule, that who or whatsoever is newly exorcised, must be rebaptized, as also such as walke or talke in their sleepe; for (say they) call them by their names, and presently they wake, or fall if they clime; whereby it is gathered, that they are not truly named in baptisme. Item they say, it is somewhat more difficult to conjure the divell out of one bewitched then out of one possessed; because in the bewitched, he is double; in the other single. They have a hundred such beggerly, foolish, and frivolous notes in this behalfe.</p>

                     <p>Other grosse absurdities of witchmongers in this matter of conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>SUrely I cannot see what difference or distinction the witchmongers doe put betweene the knowledge and power of God and the divell; but that they think, if they pray or rather talk to God, till their heartsake, he never heareth them; but that the divell doth know every thought and imagination of their minds, and both can and also will do any thing for them. For if any that meaneth good faith with the divell read certaine conjurations, he commeth up (they say) at a trice. Marry if another that hath no intent to raise him, reade or pronounce the words, be will not stirre.<note place="margin">A conjuror then belike must not be timerous or fearefull.</note> And yet 1. <hi>Bodin</hi> confesseth, that he is afraid to read such conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as <hi>Iohn Wierus</hi> reciteth; lest (belike) the divell would come up, and scratch him with his fowle long nailes. In which sort I wonder that the divell dealeth with none other, then witches and conjurors. I for my part have read a number of their conjurations, but never could see any divels of theirs, except it were in a play. But the divell (belike) know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my mind; to wit, that I would be loth to come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of his clawes.<note place="margin">Where a witch cureth by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, and the conjuror by conjuration.</note> But lo what reason such people have. <hi>Bodin, Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus, Spineus, Sprenger,</hi> and <hi>Institor,</hi> &amp;c: do constantly affirme, that witches are to be punished with more extremity than conjurors; and sometimes with death, when the other are to be pardoned doing the same offense: because (say they) the witches make a league with the divell, and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:58850:177"/>
so do not conjurors. Now if conjurors make no league by their owne confession, and divels indeed know not our cogitations (as I have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved) then would I weet of our witchmongers the reason, (if I read the conjuration and performe the ceremony) why the divell will not come at my cal? But oh absurd credulity! Even in this point many wise and learned men have been and are abused: whereas, if they would make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or duly expend the cause, they might be soone resolved; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the whole art and circumstance is so contrary to Gods word, as it must be false, if the other be true. So as you may understand, that the papists do not only by their doctrine, in bookes and sermons teach and publish conjurations, and the order thereof, whereby they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to bestow, or rather cast away their money upon masses and suffrages for their soules, but they make it also a parcell of their sacrament or orders (of the which number a conjuror is one) and insert many forms of conjurations into their divine service, and not only into their pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificals, but into their masse bookes; yea into the very canon of the masse.</p>

                     <p>The rules and lawes of popish Exorcists and other conjurors all one, with a confutation of their whole power, how S. <hi>Martine</hi> conjured the divell.</p>

                  <p>THe papists you see,<note place="margin">Papists and conjurors cousening compeers.</note> have their certaine generall rules and lawes, as to abstaine from sinne, and to fast, as also otherwise to be cleane from all pollutions, &amp;c: and even so likewise have the other conjurors. Some will say that papists use divine service, and prayers; even so do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conjurors (as you see) even in the same papisticall forme, no whit swarving from theirs in faith and doctrine, nor yet in ungodly and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable kinds of petitions.

                     </gap>cheth the hearts, and only worketh great wonders. The which argument being prosecuted to the end, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be answered:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.7. 1 Reg. 8.39. Jere. 17.10. Psal. 44.21. Psal. 72.18.</note> in so much as that divine power is required in that action.</p>
                  <p>And if it be said, that in this conjuration we speake to the spirits, and they heare us, and therefore need not know our thoughts and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: I first aske them whether king <hi>Baell,</hi> or <hi>Amoimon,</hi> which are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits raigning in the furthest regions of the east (as they say) may heare a conjurors voyce, which calleth for them, being in the extreamest parts of the west, there being such noises interposed, where perhaps also they may be busie, and set to worke on the like affaires. Secondly, whether those spirits be of the same power that God is, who is every where, filling all places, and able to heare all men at one instant, &amp;c. Thirdly, whence commeth the force of such words as raise the dead, and command divels. If sounds do it, then may it be done by a taber and a pipe, or any other instrument that hath no life. If the voyce do it, then may it be done by any beasts or birds. If words, then a parret may do it. If in mans words only, where is the force, in the the first, second, or third syllable? If in syllables, then not in words. If in imaginations, then the divell knoweth our thoughts. But all this stuffe is vaine and fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                  <p>It is written;<note place="margin">Sap. 1.14. Ecclesi. 9. Gen. 1. Act. 19.</note> All the generations of the earth were healthfull, and there is no poyson of destruction in them. Why then do they conjure holsome creatures; as salt, water, &amp;c: where no divels are? God looked upon all his works, and saw they were all good. What effect (I pray you) had the 7. sonnes of <hi>Sceva</hi>; which is the great objection of witchmongers? They would needs take upon them to conjure divels out of the possessed. But what brought they to passe? Yet that was in the time, whilest God suffered miracles commonly to be wrought. By that, you may see what conjurors can do.</p>
                  <p>Where is such a promise to conjurors or witches,<note place="margin">Mark. 16.17.</note> as is made in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to the faithfull? where it is written; In my name they shall cast
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58850:179"/>
out divels, speake with new tongues: if they shall drinke any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall take away serpents, they shall lay hands on the sicke, and they shall recover. According to the promise, this grant of miraculous working was performed in the primitive church, for the confirmation of Christs doctrine, and the establishing of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>But as in another place I have proved, the gift thereof was but for a time, and is now ceased; neither was it ever made to papist, witch, or conjuror. They take upon them to call up and cast out divels; and to undoe with one divell, that which another divell hath done. If one divell could cast out another, it were a kingdome divided, and could not stand. Which argument Christ himselfe maketh: and therefore I may the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re boldly say even with Christ, that they have no such power. For <note n="a" place="margin">Isa 43.11.</note> besides him, there is no saviour, <note n="b" place="margin">verse. 13. cap. 44. ver 7. verse 25. Isai. 46.10. cap 47. verse 12, 13, &amp;c. Luke 11.20, Matt. 12.28. Acts, 8.49.</note> none can deliver out of his hand. Who but he can declare, set in order, appoint, and tell what is to come? He destroyeth the the tokens of foothsayers and maketh the conjecturers fooles, &amp;c. He declareth things to come, and so cannot witches.</p>
                  <p>There is no helpe in inchanters and soothsayers, and other such vaine sciences. For divels are cast out by the finger of God, which <hi>Matthew</hi> calleth the spirit of God, which is the mighty power of God, and not by the vertue of the bare name only, being spoken or pronounced; for then might every wicked man do it. And <hi>Simon Magus</hi> needed not then to have proffered mony to have brought the power to do miracles and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: for he could speake and pronounce the name of God, as well as the apostles. Indeed they may soone throw out all the divells that are in frankincense, and such like creatures, wherein no divels are: but neither they, nor all their holy water can indeed cure a man possessed with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, either in body and mind; as Christ did. Nay, why do they not cast out the divell that possesseth their owne soules?</p>
                  <p>Let me heare any of them all speake with new tongues; let them drinke but one dramme of a potion which I will prepare for them, let them cure the sicke by laying on of hands (though witches take it upon them, and witchmongers beleeve it) and then I will subscribe unto them. But if they which repose such certainety in the actions of witches and conjurors, would diligently note their deceit, and how the scope whereat they shoote is money (I meane not such witches as are falsely accused,<note place="margin">Mony is the marke whereat all witches and conjurors do aime.</note> but such as take upon them to give answers; &amp;c: as mother <hi>Bungie</hi> did) they should apparently see the cousenage. For they are abused, as are many beholders of jugglers, which suppose they do miraculously, that which is done by sleight and subtilty.</p>
                  <p>But in this matter of witchcrafts and conjurations, if men would rather trust their own eyes, than old wives tales and lies, I dare undertake this matter would soone be at a perfect point; as being easier to be perceived than juggling. But I must needs confesse, that it is no great marvell, though the simple be abused therein, when such lies concerning those matters are maintained by such persons of account, and thrust into their divine service. As for example:

                     <hi>Salomon</hi> was the greatest philosopher, and did philosophy about all things, and had the full and perfect knowledge of all their properties: but he had that gift given from above to him, for the profit and health of mankinde; which is effectuall against divels.

In the mean time he made mention of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> reciting incantations of <hi>Salomons</hi> owne making.

Though it were cruelly done of her to beat the divell, when his hands was bound; yet it was curteously done of her, to pull away her foot at his desire. He could not speak so long as she troad on his head, and yet he said; Tread off, that I may tell you what I am. She saw the heavens open, and yet she was in a close prison. But her sight was very clear, that could see a little dove sitting upon a crosse so far off. For heaven is higher than the Sun; and the sun, when it is neerest to us, is 3966000. miles from us.

And wheresoever you shall heare, that there is in the night season such rumbling and fearefull noises, be you well assured that it is flat knavery, performed by some that seemeth most to complaine, and is least mistrusted. And hereof there is a very art, which for some respects I will not discover. The divell seeketh dayly as well as nightly whom he may devour, and can do his feats as well by day as by night, or else he is a young divell, and a very bungler. But of all other couseners, these conjurors are in the highest degree, and are most worthy of death for their blasphemous impiety. But that these popish visions and conjurations used as well by papists, as by the popes themselves, were meere cousenages; and that the tales of the popes recited by <hi>Bruno</hi> and <hi>Platin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Howbeit they affirm that they will not tell all that might make to the manifestation of their holinesse: for then should their owne praise stink in their owne mouths. And yet God knoweth their whole book containeth nothing but stinking lies and popery. Which groundwork and foundation how weak and wavering it is, how unlike to continue, and how slenderly laid, a child may soone discerne and perceive.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Reasons to prove that words and characters are but bables, and that witches cannot doe such things as the multitude supposeth they can, their greatest wonders proved trifles, of a young gentleman cousened.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THat words, characters, images, and such other trinkers, which are thought so necessary instruments for witchcraft (as without the which no such thing can be accomplished) are but bables, devised by couseners, to abuse the people withall; I trust I have sufficiently proved. And the same may be further and more plainly perceived by these short and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious reasons following.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">A necessary sequel.</note> in that the Turks and infidels, in their witchcraft, use both other words, and other characters than our witches doe, and also such as are most contrary.

                  <p>It is also to be thought,<note place="margin">

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:58850:188"/>
called <hi>Heron,</hi> a professor thereof. And this I know, partly of mine owne knowledge, and partly by the testimony of her husband, and others of credit, to whom (I say) in her death bed, and at sundry other times she protested these things; and also that she never had indeed any materiall spirit or divell (as the voice went) nor yet knew how to work any super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall matter, as she in her life time made men beleeve shee had and could doe.</p>
                  <p>The like may be said of one <hi>T.</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whose name I will not literally discover, who wonderfully abused many in these parts, making them think he could tell where any thing lost b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet on his death bed he confessed, that he knew nothing more then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by sleight and devices, without the assistance of any divell or spirit, saving the spirit of cousenage: and this did he (I say) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test before many of great honesty, credi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again, who will maintaine, that common witchcrafts are not cousen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, when the great and famous witchcrafts, which had stolne credit not only from all the common people, but from men of great wisdome and authority, are discovered to be beggerly sleights of cousening varlots?

Howbeit, I confesse, that the fear, conceipt, and doubt of such mischievous pretenses may breed inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them that stand in awe of the same.

The young Gentleman being abused with his cunning devices, and too hastily yeelding to that motion, satisfied this cunning mans demand of money. Which, because he had it not presently to disburse, provided it for him at the

hands of a friend of his. Finally, this cunning man made the three pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of wax, &amp;c. leaving nothing undone that appertained to the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senage, untill he had buried them, as you have heard.

But the young Gentleman, who for a little space remained in hope mixed with joy and love, now through tract of time hath those his felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties powdered with doubt and despaire. For in stead of atchieving his love he would gladly have obtained his mony. But because he could by no means get either the one or the other (his money being in hucksters handling, and his sure in no better forwardnesse) hee revealed the whole matter, hoping by that means to recover his money; which he neither can yet get again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not hath payed it where he borrowed.

There was one, whom for some respects I name not, that was taken blind, deaf, and dumb; so as no Physitian could help him: That man (forsooth) though he was (as is said) both blind, dumb and deaf, yet could he read any canonicall Scriptures; but as for apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha, hee could read none:<note place="margin">There the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite was overmatcht for all his dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled gravity.</note> wherein a Gods name consisted the miracle.

                     <p>How the divell preached good doctrine in the shape of a priest, how he was discovered, and that it is a shame (after confutation of the greater witchcrafts) for any man to give credit to the lesser points thereof.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ON a time the divell went up into a pulpit, and there made a very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick sermon: but a holy priest comming to the good speed, by his holinesse perceived that it was the devill. So he gave good ear unto him, but could finde no fault with his doctrine.<note place="margin">He should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have asked who gave him orders and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to preach.</note> And therefore so soon as the sermon was done, he called the divell unto him, demanding the cause of his sincere preaching; who answered: Behold I speak the truth, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that while men be hearers of the word, and not followers, God is the more offended, and my kingdome the more inlarged. And this was the strangest device (I think) that ever any divell used: for the apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves could have done no more. Againe, when with all their familiars, their ointments, &amp;c. whereby they ride invisibly, nor with all their charmes, they can neither convey themselves from the hands of such as lay wait for them; nor can get out of prison, that otherwise can goe in and out at a mouse hole; nor finally can save themselves from the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that can transubstantiate their owne and others bodies into flies or fleas, &amp;c. who seeth not, that either they lye, or are belyed in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; when they are said to transfer their neighbours corne into their owne ground, and yet are perpetual beggers, and cannot inrich themselves, either with money or otherwise: who is so foolish as to remain longer in doubt of their supernaturall power? When never any yet from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world till this day, hath openly shewed any other trick, conceipt, or cunning point of witchcraft, than legierdemaine or cousenage: who will tarry any longer for further tryall? when both the common law and also the injunctions doe condemne prophesying, and likewise false miracles, and such as beleeve them in these dayes: who will not be afraid to give credit to those knaveries?

If the soul live ever (say the other) the least portion of life is here.

                  <p>That the divels assaults are spirituall and not temporall, and how grossely some understand those parts of the scripture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>UPon that, which hitherto hath been said, you see that the assaults of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan are spiritual,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.11, 12.</note> and not temporal; in which respect <hi>Paul</hi> wisheth us not to provide a corselet of steel to defend us from his clawes; but bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the invasions of the divell. For we wrestle not against flesh and bloud; but against principalities, powers, and spirituall wickednesse. And therefore he adviseth us to be sober and watch;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.8.9.</note> for the divel goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. He meaneth not with carnal teeth;<note place="margin">Idem. ibid.</note> for it followeth thus, Whom resist ye stedfastly in faith. And again he saith, That which is spiritual only discerneth spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> for no carnal man can discerne the things of the spirit. Why then should we think that a divel, which is a spirit, can be knowne, or made tame and familiar unto a natural man; or contrary to nature, can be by a witch made corporal, being by God ordained to a spiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion?</p>
               <p>The cause of this grosse conceipt is, that we hearken more diligently to old wives, and rather give credit to their fables, than to the word of God; imagining by the tales they tell us, that the divel is such a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begger, as I have before described. For whatsoever is proposed in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to us by parable, or spoken figuratively or significatively, or framed to our grosse capacities, &amp;c. is by them so considered and expounded, as though the bare letter, or rather their grosse imaginations thereupon were to be preferred before the true sense and meaning of the word. For I dare say,<note place="margin">Judg. 9.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> that when these blockheads read <hi>Iothans</hi> parable in the ninth of Judges to the men of <hi>Sichem</hi>; to wit, that the trees went out to annoint a king over them, saying to the olive tree, Reigne thou over us; who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and said, Should I leave my fatnesse, &amp;c. they imagine that the wooden trees walked, and spake with a mans voice: or else, that some spirit entred into the trees, and answered as is imagined they did in the idols and oracles of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and such like; who indeed have eyes, and see not; ears and hear not; mouthes, and speak not, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>The equivocation of this word spirit, how diversly it is taken in the scriptures, where (by the way) is taught that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not alwayes literally to be interpreted, nor yet allegorically to be understood.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SUch as search with the spirit of wisdome and understanding, shal finde, that spirits, as well good as bad, are in scriptures diversly taken: yea they shal well perceive, that the divel is no horned beast. For <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 31.1.</note> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the scriptures, spirits and divels are taken for infirmities of the body; <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 8.19.

Matth. 16.</note> Sometimes a man is called a divel, as <hi>Iudas</hi> in the sixt of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> in the xvi. of <hi>Matthew.</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.

               <p>And to interpret unto us the nature and signification of spirits, we find these words written in the scripture; to wit, The spirit of the Lord shal rest upon him; The spirit of counsel and strength; The spirit of wisdome and understanding; The spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. Again, I will pour out my spirit upon the house of <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. The spirit of grace and compassion.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.15. 1 Cor. 12.8, 9, 10.</note> Again, Ye have not received the spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, but the spirit of adoption., And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> saith, To one is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by the spirit, the word of wisdome; to another, the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by the same spirit, to another, the gift of healing; to another, the gift of faith by the same spirit; to another, the gift of prophesie; to another,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.11</note> the operation of great works; to another, the discerning of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; to another, the diversity of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues: and all these things worketh one and the self same spirit.

                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 28. Hest. 16.</note>As for the spirits of divination spoken of in the scripture, they are such as was in the woman of <hi>Endor,</hi> the <hi>Philippian</hi> woman, the wench of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> and the holy maid of <hi>Kent</hi>; who were indued with spirits or gifts of divination, whereby they could make shift to gain money, and abuse the people by sleights and crafty inventions. But these are possessed of borrowed spirits,<note place="margin">Sap. 15.13, 29.</note> as it is written in the book of Wisdome; and spirits of meer cousenage and deceipt, as I have sufficiently proved elsewhere. I deny not therefore that there are spirits and divels, of such substance as it hath pleased God to create them. But in what place soever it be found or read in the scriptures, a spirit or divel is to be understood spiritually, and is neither a corporall nor a visible thing. Where it is written, that God sent an evil spirit between <hi>Abimelech,</hi>

Whereby it is to be seen, that although it be said, that satan had bound her, &amp;c. yet that it was a sicknesse or disease of body that troubled her; for Christs own words expound it. Neither is there any word of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft mentioned, which some s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There were seven divels cast out of <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 16.9.</note> Which is not so grossely understood by the learned, as that there were in her just seven corporal divels, such as I described before elsewhere; but that by the number of seven divels, a great multitude, and an uncertain number of vices is signified; which figure is usual in divers places of the scripture. And this interpretation is more agreeable with Gods word,<note place="margin">Levit. 26. Prov. 24. Luk. 17.</note> than the papisticall paraphrase, which is; that Christ, under the name of the seven divels, recounteth the seven deadly sins only. Others allow neither of these expositions; because they suppose that the efficacy of Christs mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle should this way be confounded; as though it were not as difficult a matter, with a touch to make a good Christian of a vicious person; as with a word to cure the ague,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.16.</note> or any other disease of a sick body. I think not but any of both these cures may be wrought by means, in processe of time, without miracle; the one by the preacher, the other by the physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. But I say that Christs work in both was apparently miraculous: for with power and authority, even with a touch of his finger, and a word of his mouth,<note place="margin">Luk. 4.36. Luk. 7.21.</note> he made the blinde to see, the halt to goe, the lepers clean, the deaf to hear, the dead to rise again, and the poor to receive the Gospel, out of whom (I say) he cast divels, and miraculously conformed them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come good Christians,<note place="margin">John 8.11.</note> which before were dissolute livers; to whom he said, Go your wayes and sin no more.</p>

               <p>JEsus Christ,<note place="margin">Luk. 8.14.</note> to manifest his divine power, rebuked the winds, and they ceased; and the waves of water, and it was calme; which if neither our divines nor physicians can do, much lesse our conjurors, and least of all our old witches can bring any such thing to passe. But it pleased God to manifest the power of Christ Jesus by such miraculous and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means, providing and as it were preparing diseases, that none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise could be cured, that his sons glory, and his peoples faith might the more plainly appear;<note place="margin">Levit. 14 7, 8. Luk. 7.17.4 John 9.</note> as namely, leprosie, lunacy, and blindnesse, as it is apparent in the Gospel, where it is said, that the man was not stricken with blindnesse for his owne sinnes, nor for any offence of his ancestors;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:58850:201"/>
but that he was made blinde, to the intent the works of God should be shewed upon him by the hands of Jesus Christ. But witches with their charmes can cure (as witchmongers affirme) all these diseases mentioned in the scripture, and many other more; as the gout, the toothach, &amp;c. which we find not that ever Christ cured.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 4.17, &amp;c.</note>As touching those that are said in the Gospel to be possessed of spirits, it seemeth in many places that it is indifferent, or all one, to say; He is posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a divel; or, he is lunatick or phrentick; which disease in these dayes is said to proceed of melancholy. But if every one that now is lunatick, be possessed with a real divel; then might it be thought, that divels are to be thrust out of men by medicines. But who saith in these times with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan,</hi> My daughter is vexed with a divel, except it be presupposed, that she meant her daughter was troubled with some disease? Indeed we say, and say truely, to the wicked, the divel is in him: but we mean not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that a real divel is gotten into his guts. And if it were so, I marvel in what shape this reall divel, that possesseth them, remaineth. Entreth he into the body in one shape, and into the minde in another? If they grant him to be spiritual and invisible, I agree with them.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion, that the said woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> meant indeed that her daughter was troubled with some disease; because it is written in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead of that the divel was cast out, that her daughter was made whole, even the selfe same houre.<note place="margin">Mat. 15.28.</note> According to that which is said in the 12. of <hi>Matthew</hi>; There was brought unto Christ one possessed of a divel, which was both blinde and dumbe, and he healed him: so as, he that was blind and dumbe both spake and saw.<note place="margin">Mat. 12.22.</note> But it was the man, and not the divel, that was healed, and made to speak and see.

                     <hi>Mal. males. quaest.</hi> 5. <hi>pa.</hi> 1.</note> and <hi>Henry Institor</hi> do gather and note the cause, why the divel maketh choice to possesse men at certaine times of the moone; which is (say they) in two respects: first, that they may defame so good a creature as the moon; secondly, because the brain is the moistest part of the body. The divel therefore considereth the aptnesse and conveniency thereof (the <note n="*" place="margin">A maxime in philosophy, as the sun <hi>in aridis &amp; fiecis.</hi>
                  </note> moon having dominion over all moist things) so as they take advantage thereby, tho better to bring their purposes to passe.

               <argument>
                  <p>That we being not throughly informed of the nature of divels and spirits, must satisfie our selves with that which is delivered us in the Scriptures touching the same, how this word divell is to be understood both in the singular and plurall number, of the spirit of God and the spirit of the divell, of tame spirits, of <hi>Ahab.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe nature therefore and substance of divels and spirits, because in the scripture it is not so set down, as we may certainly know the same; we ought to content and frame our selves faithfully to beleeve the words and sense there delivered unto us by the high spirit, which is the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Num. 27.16.</note> who is Lord of all spirits; alwayes considering, that evermore spirits are spoken of in scripture, as of things spirituall, though for the help os our capacities they are there sometime more grossely and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally expressed, either in parables or by metaphors, than indeed they are. As for example (and to omit the history of <hi>Iob,</hi> which elsewhere I han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle) it is written;<note place="margin">1 Reg. 18; verse 23. verse 4.</note> The Lord said, Who shall entice <hi>Ahab,</hi> that hee may fall at <hi>Ramoth Gilead, &amp;c.</hi> Then came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said; I will goe entise him. And the Lord said, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with? And he said; I will goe and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. Then he said; Goe forth, thou shalt prevaile, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This story is here set forth in this wise, to bear with our capacities, and specially with the capacity of that age, that could not otherwise conceive of spirituall things, than by such corporall demonstrations. And yet here is to be noted, that one spirit, and not many or diverse, did possesse all the false prophets at once.<note place="margin">Luke 8.27, 28. Mark. 5.9. Luk. 8.</note> Even as in another place, many thousand divels are said to possesse one man; and yet it is also said even in the self same place, that the same man was possessed only with one divell. For it is there said that Christ met a man, which had a divell, and hoe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the foul spirit to come forth of the man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>I. Cal. lib. inflit. lib.</hi> 1 <hi>cap</hi> 14. <hi>sect.</hi> 14.</note> &amp;c. But <hi>Calvine</hi> saith, Where satan or the divell is named in the singular number, thereby is meant that power of wickednesse, that standeth against the kingdome of justice. And where many divels are named in the scriptures, we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by taught, that we must fight with an infinite multitude of enemies, lest despising the fewnesse of them, we should be more flack to enter into barrell, and so fall into security and idlenesse.</p>

                  <p>Whether Spirits and soules can assume bodies, and of their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and substance, wherein writers doe extreamly contend and vary.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOme hold opinion, that spirits and soules can assume and take unto them bodies at their pleasure, of what shape or substance they lift; of which mind all papists, and some protestants are, being more grosse than another sort, which hold that such bodies are made to their hands. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, these doe varie in the elements, wherewith these spirituall bodies are composed. For (as I have said) some affirm that they consist of fire, some think of air,<note place="margin">For every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall motion is either circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</note> and some of the starres and other celestiall powers. But if they be celestiall, then (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> saith) must they follow the circular motion: and if they be elementary, then must they follow the motions of those elements, of which their bodies consist. Of air they cannot be, for air is <hi>Corpus homogeneum</hi>; so as every part of air is air, whereof there can be no distinct members made. For an organicall body must have bones, sinews, veins, flesh, &amp;c. which cannot be made of air. Neither (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> affirmeth) can an airy body receive or have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shape or figure. But some ascend up into the clouds, where they find (as they say) diverse shapes and formes even in the air. Unto which objection <hi>P. Martyr</hi> answereth, saying, and that truly, that clouds are not

               <argument>
                  <p>Certaine popish reasons concerning, spirits made of air, of day divels and night divels, and why the divell loveth no salt in his meat.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MAny affirm (upon a fable cited by <hi>M. Mal.</hi>) that spirits are of air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have been cut (as he saith) in sunder and closed presently again; and also because they vanish away so suddenly. But of such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions I have already spoken, and am shortly to say more, which are rather seen in the imagination of the weak and diseased, than in verity and truth. Which sights and apparitions, as they have been common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the unfaithfull; so now, since the preaching of the Gospell they are most rare. And as among fainthearted people; namely, women, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and sick folks, they usually swarmed: so among strong bodies and good stomachs they never used to appeare; as elsewhere I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; which argueth that they were only phantasticall and imaginary. Now say they that imagine divels and spirits to be made of air, that it must needs bee that they consist of that element; because otherwise when they vanish suddenly away, they should leave some earthy substance behinde them. If they were of water, then should they moisten the place where they stand, and must needs be shed on the floore. If they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of fire, then would they burn any thing that touched them: and yet (say they) <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> washed their feet,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.19.</note> and were neither scalded nor burnt.</p>
               <p>I finde it not in the Bible, but in <hi>Bodin,</hi> that there are day divels and night divels.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>I. Bod. lib. de daem.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 4.</note> The same fellow saith, that <hi>Deber</hi> is the name of that divell, which hurteth by night; and <hi>Cheleb</hi> is he that hurreth by day: howbeit, he confesseth that Satan can hurt both by day and night; although it be certain (as he saith) that he can doe more harm by night than by day; producing for example,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.29.</note> how in a night he slew the first born of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And yet it appeareth plainly in the text, that the Lord himself did it. Whereby it seemeth, that <hi>Bodin</hi> putteth no difference between God and the divell.

               <p>SUch divels are mentioned in the Scriptures by name, have in their names their nature and qualities expressed, being for the most part the idols of certaine nations idolatrously erected, in stead, or rather in spight of God.<note place="margin">2 Reg. 13.</note> For <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> which signifieth the lord of the flies, because he taketh every simple thing in his web, was an idol or oracle erected at <hi>Ekron,</hi> to whom <hi>Ahaziah</hi> sent to know whether he should recover his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease: as though there had been no God in Israel.<note place="margin">Mat. 10 &amp; 12.

                  <p>A comparison between the heathen and the papists, touching their excuses for idolatry.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANd because I know, that the papists will say, that their idols are saints, and no such divels as the gods of the Gentiles were: you may tell them, that not only their saints, but the very images of them were called <hi>Divi.</hi>

                  </gap>) thereunto, and it is <hi>Divill</hi> in English. But they will say also that I do them wrong to gibe at them; because they were holy men and holy women. I grant some of them were so, and further from allowance of the popish idolatry employed upon them, than grieved with the derision used against that abuse. Yea even as silver and gold are made idols unto them that love them too well, and seek too much for them: so are these holy men and women made idols by them that worship them, and attribute unto them such honour, as to god only appertaineth.</p>
               <p>The heathen gods were for the most part good men, and profitable members to the commonwealth wherein they lived, and deserved fame &amp;c. in which respect they made gods of them when they were dead; as they made divels of such emperours and philosophers as they hated, or as had deserved ill among them. And is it not even so, and worse, in the common wealth and church of popery? Doth not the pope excommunicate, curse, and condemne for hereticks, and drive to the bottomlesse pit of hell, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming to the very divels, all those that either write, speak, or think, contrary to his idolatrous doctrine? <hi>Cicero,</hi> when he derided the heathen gods,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and inveyed against them that yeelded such servile honour unto them, knew the persons, unto whom such abuse was committed, had well deserved as civill citizens; and that good fame was due unto them, and not divine estimation. Yea the infidels that honoured those gods, as hoping to receive benefits for their devotion employed that way, knew and conceived that the statues and images, before whom with such reverence
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:58850:207"/>
they powred forth their prayers, were stocks and stones, and only pictures of those persons whom they resembled: yea they also knew, that the parties themselves were creatures, and could not doe so much as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and witchmongers think the Roode of grace, or mother <hi>Bungie</hi> could doe.<note place="margin">The papists see a moth in the eye of others, but no beam in their owne.</note> And yet the papists can see the abuse of the Gentiles, and may not hear of their owne idolatry more grosse and damnable than the others.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The conceipt of the heathen and the papists all one in idolatry, of the councell of Trent, a notable story of a hangman arraigned after he was dead and buried, &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt papists perchance will deny, that they attribute so much to these idols as I report; or that they think it so meritorious to pray to the images of saints as is supposed, affirming thay they worship God, and the saints themselves, under the formes of images. Which was also the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the heathen, and their excuse in this behalf; whose eyesight and insight herein reached as farre as the papisticall distinctions published by popes and their councels. Neither doe any of them admit so grosse idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as the councel of <hi>Trent</hi> hath done,<note place="margin">The idolatrous councell of Trent.</note> who alloweth that worship to the Rood that is due to Jesus Christ himselfe, and so likewise of other images of saints. I thought it not impertinent therefore in this place to insert an example taken out of the Rosarie of our Lady, in which book do remain (besides this) ninety and eight examples to this effect: which are of such authority in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that all scripture must give place unto them. And these are either read there as their speciall homilies, or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by their chief doctors. And this is the sermon for this day verbatim translated out of the said Rosarie, a book much esteemed and reverenced among papists.</p>

Afterwards, while he prayed before her, he was called away to hang an offendor; but his enemies intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and slew him by the way. And loe a certain holy priest, which nightly walked about every church in the city, rose up that night, and was going to his Lady, I should say to our Lady church. And in the churchyard he saw a great many dead men, and some of them he knew, of whom he asked what the matter was, &amp;c. who answered, that the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was slain, and the divel challenged his soul, the which our Lady said was hers: and the judge was even at hand comming thither to hear the cause, and therefore (said they) we are now come together. The priest thought he would be at the hearing hereof, and hid himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a tree;<note place="margin">But our Lady spied him well enough; as you shal read.</note> and anon he saw the judiciall seat ready prepared and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, where the judge, to wit, Jesus Christ, sate, who took up his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto him. Soon after the divels brought in the hangman pinnioned, and proved by good evidence, that his soul belonged to them. On the

other side, our Lady pleaded for the hangman, proving that he at the hour of death commended his soul to her. The judge hearing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so well debated on either side, but willing to obey (for these are his words) his mothers desire, and loath to do the divels any wrong, gave sentence that the hangmans soul should returne to his body, untill he had made sufficient satisfaction; ordaining that the pope should set forth a publick forme of prayer for the hangmans soul. It was demanded, who should doe the errand to the popes holinesse? Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>BY the tale above mentioned you see what it is to worship the image of our lady.<note place="margin">Our B. ladies favour.</note> For though we kneel to God himself, and make never so humble petitions unto him, without faith and repentance, it shall do us no pleasure at all. Yet this hangman had great friendship shewed him for one point of courtesie used to our lady, having not one dramme of faith, repentance, nor yet of honesty in him. Neverthelesse, so credulous is the nature of man, as to beleeve this and such like fables: yea, to discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit such stuffe, is thought among the papists flat heresie. And though we that are protestants will not beleeve these toies, being so apparently po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish: yet we credit and report other appearances, and assuming of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by souls and spirits; though they be as prophane, absurd, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious as the other.

                  <p>A confutation of assuming of bodies, and of the serpent that seduced Eve.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THey that contend so earnestly for the divels assuming of bodies and visible shapes, do think they have a great advantage by the words ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the third of <hi>Genesis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.14, 15.</note> where they say, the divell entered into a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or snake; and that by the curse it appeareth, that the whole displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God lighted upon the poor snake only. How those words are to be considered may appear, in that it is of purpose so spoken, as our weak capacities may thereby best conceive the substance, tenor, and true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the word, which is there set downe in the manner of a tragedie, in such humane and sensible forme, as wonderfully informeth our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; though it seem contrary to the spirituall course of spirits and divels, and also to the nature and divinity of God himself; who is infinite, and whom no man ever saw with corporall eyes, and lived. And doubtlesse, if the serpent there had not been taken absolutely, nor meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically for the divell, the Holy-ghost would have informed us thereof in some part of that story. But to affirme it sometimes to be a divell, and sometimes a snake; whereas there is no such distinction to be found or seen in the text, is an invention and a fetch (me thinks) beyond the compasse of all divinity.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.1. 1 Cor. 11.3.</note> Certainly the serpent was he that seduced <hi>Eve</hi>; now whether it were the divell, or a snake; let any wise man (or rather let the word of God) judge. Doubtlesse the scripture in many places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it to be the divell.<note place="margin">Sap. 2.24.</note> And I have (I am sure) one wiseman on my side for the interpretation hereof, namely <hi>Solomon</hi>; who saith, Through envie of the divell came death into the world; referring that to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, which <hi>Moses</hi> in the letter did to the serpent. But a better expositor hereof needeth, not, than the text it self, even in the same place, where it is written; I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed, he shall break thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. What christian knoweth not, that in these words the mystery of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:58850:209"/>

                  <p>The objection concerning the divels assuming of the serpents body answered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis word serpent in holy scripture is taken for the divell:<note place="margin">Gen. 3.1.</note> The serpent was more subtill than all the beasts of the field. It likewise signifieth such as be evill speakers, such as have slandering tongues, also here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, &amp;c.

John 3 14.</note> so must the son of man be lifted up upon the crosse. Moreover, it is taken for wicked men: O ye serpents and generation of vipers. Thereby also is signified as well a wise as a subtill man: and in that sense did Christ himself use it;<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that by this brief collection you see, that the word serpent, as it is equivocall, so likewise it is sometimes taken in the good and sometimes in the evill part. But where it is said, that the serpent was father of lies, author of death, and the worker of deceipt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me thinks it is a ridiculous opinion to hold, that thereby a snake is meant; which must be, if the letter be preferred before the allegory.<note place="margin">

Finally, he saith even hereupon, that the Lord hath supplyed, with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret light of his spirit, whatsoever wanted in plainnesse and clearnesse of eternall words.</p>
               <p>If it be said, according to experience, that certain other beasts are farre more subtill than the serpent; they answer, that it is not absurd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that the same gift was taken away from him, by God, because he brought destruction to mankind. Which is more (me thinks) than need be granted in that behalfe.<note place="margin">Mat. 10.16.</note> For Christ saith not; Be ye wise as serpents

were before their transgression; but, Be wise as serpents are. I would learn what impiety, absurdity, or offense it is to hold, that <hi>Moses,</hi> under the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of poysoning serpent or snake, describeth the divell that poysoned <hi>Eve</hi> with his deceiptfull words,<note place="margin">Isai. 30.6.

For I think none so grosse, as to suppose, that the wicked are the children of snakes, according to the letters no more than we are to think and gather, that God keepeth a book of life, written with penne and inke upon paper; as citizens record their free men.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe curse rehearsed by God in that place, whereby witchmongers labour so busily to prove that the divell entered into the body of a snake, and by consequence can take the body of any other creature at his pleasure &amp;c. reacheth I think further into the divels matters, than we can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it, or is needfull for us to know, that understand not the wayes of the divels creeping, and is far unlikely to extend to plague the generation of snakes; as though they had been made with legges before that time, and through his curse was deprived of that benefit.

the bodies of the blessed, sometimes for the souls of the blessed, sometimes for the power imaginative or the minde of man; and sometimes for God. Again he saith, that of spirits there are two sorts, some created and some uncreated.</p>
               <p>A spirit uncreated (saith he) is God himselfe, and it is essentially ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and agreeth unto the three persons notionally, to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost personally. A spirit created is a creature, and that is likewise of two sorts; to wit, bodily, and bodilesse. A bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirit is also of two sorts: for some kinde of spirit is so named of spiritualnesse, as it is distinguished from bodilinesse: otherwise it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Spiritus a spirando, id est, a stando,</hi> of breathing or blowing, as the winde doth.</p>
               <p>A bodilesse spirit is one way so named of spiritualnesse, and then it is taken for a spirituall substance; and is of two sorts; some make a full and compleat kind, and is called compleat or perfect, as a spirit angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: some doe not make a full and perfect kind, and is called incompleat or unperfect as the soule. There is also the spirit vitall, which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine subtill or very fine substance necessarily disposing and tending unto life. There be moreover spirits naturall, which are a kind of subtill and very fine substances, disposing and tending unto equall complexions of bodies. Again there be spirits animall, which are certain subtill and very fine substances disposing and tempering the body, that it might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated of the form, that is, that it might be perfected of the reasonable soul. Thus far he. In whose division you see a philosophicall kinde of proceeding, though not altogether to be condemned, yet in every point not to be approved.</p>

               <p>Their first argument is knit up in this manner.<note n="1" place="margin">Objection. The scripture doth never call the holy spirit God.</note> The holy spirit is no where expressely called God in the scriptures; <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The antecedent of this argument is false; because the holy spirit hath the title or name of God in the fift of the Acts. Again, the consequent is false. For although he were not expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called God,<note n="*" place="margin">The 1. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> yet should it not thereupon be concluded that he is not very God; because unto him are attributed all the properties of God, which unto this doe equally belong.<note place="margin">A refutation of the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent &amp;c.</note> And as we deny not that the father is the true light, although it be not directly written of the father, but of the sonne; He was the true light giving light to every man that commeth into this world; so likewise it is not to be denyed, that the spirit is God, although the scripture doth not expressely and simply note it; sithence it ascribeth equall things thereunto; as the properties of God, the works of God, the service due to God, and that it doth interchangeably take the names of Spirit and of God oftentimes. They therefore that see these things attributed unto the holy spirit, and yet will not suffer him to be called by the name of God; do as it were refuse to grant unto <hi>Eve</hi> the name of <hi>Homo,</hi>

Now if any aske me why <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie</hi> was so coy and nice to name the holy spirit, God, whom he denieth to be a creature, when as notwithstanding between God and a creature there is no mean: I will in good sooth say what I think. I suppose that <hi>Hilary,</hi> for himself thought well of the godhead of the holy spirit: but this opinion was thrust and forced upon him of the <hi>Pneumatomachi,</hi> who at that time rightly deeming of the son did erewhiles joine themselves to those that were sound of judgement.

                     </gap>bet, fratres charissimi, &amp;c.</hi> It ought to seem no wonder unto you dear brethren, &amp;c. As for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the prayers of the church called the collects, that in them the holy spirit is not called upon by name: we oppose and set against them the songs of the church, wherein the said spirit is called upon. But the collects are more ancient then the songs, hymnes, and anthems. I will not now contend about ancientnesse, neither will I compare songs and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects together; but I say thus much only, to wit, that in the most ancient times of the church the holy spirit hath been openly called upon in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Now if I be charged to give an instance,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Collecta in die domin. sanctae Trinit.</hi>
                  </note> let this serve. In the collect upon trinity sunday it is thus said; Almighty and everlasting God, which hast given unto us thy servants grace by the confession of a truth to acknowledge the glory of the eternall trinity, and in the power of the divine Majesty to worship the unity; we beseech thee that through the stedfastnesse of this faith, we may evermore be defended from all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, which livest and reignest one God world without end. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in this collect, where the trinity is expressely called upon, the names of persons are not expressed; but almighty and everlasting God invocated, who abideth in trinity and unity; it doth easily appear elsewhere also that the persons being not named under the name of almighty &amp; ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting God, not only the father to be understood, but God which, abideth in trinity and unity, that is the father, the sonne, and the Holy-ghost.</p>
               <p>A third objection of theirs is this. The sonne of God oftentimes pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the gospels, speaking unto the father, promiseth the holy spirit, and doth also admonish the apostles to pray unto the heavenly father, but yet in the name of the sonne.<note n="3" place="margin">Objection. The spirit is not to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto but the father on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> Besides that, he prescribeth them this forme of prayer. Our father which art in heaven. <hi>Ergo</hi> the father only is to be called upon, and consequently the father only is that one and very true God, of whom it is written; Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">3. Answer. The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is denied.</note> Whereto I answer first by denying the consequent; The son prayed to the father only, <hi>Ergo</hi> the father only is of us also to be prayed unto. For the sonne of God is distinguished of us both in person and in office; he as a mediator maketh intercession for us to the father; and although the
<pb facs="tcp:58850:214"/>
sonne and the holy spirit do both together receive and take us into favour with God; yet is he said to intreat the father for us; because the father is the fountain of all counsels and divine works. Furthermore touching the forme of praying described of Christ, it is not necessary that the fathers name should personally be there taken, sith there is no distinction of persons made; but by the name of father indefinitely wee understand God or the essence of God, the father, the sonne, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-ghost. For this name hath not alwaies a respect unto the generation of the sonne of God; but God is called the father of the faithfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his gracious and free adopting of them, the foundation whereof is the son of God, in whom we be adopted: but yet so adopted, that not the father only receiveth us into his favour; but with him also the sonne and the holy spirit doth the same. Therefore when we in the beginning of prayer do advertise our selves of Gods goodnesse towards us; we doe not cast an eye to the father alone, but also to the sonne, who gave us the spirit of adoption; and to the holy spirit in whom we cry <hi>Abba,</hi> Father. And if so be that invocation and prayer were restrained to the father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, then had the saints done amisse, in calling upon, invocating, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the son of God, and with the son the holy spirit, in baptisme, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme by Christ himselfe assigned and delivered.</p>
               <p>Another objection is out of the fourth of <hi>Amos,</hi>
                  <note n="4" place="margin">Objection. Amos saith that the spirit was created.</note> in this manner. For lo it is I that make the thunder, and create the spirit, and shew unto men their Christ, making the light and the clouds, and mounting above the high places of the earth, the Lord God of hosts is his name. Now because it is read in that place, shewing unto men their Christ; the <hi>Pneumatoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> contended that these words are to be understood of the holy spirit.</p>

                  <note n="*" place="margin">4. Answer.

Howbeit, the same father saith; If any suppose that these words are to be drawn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the interpretation of the holy spirit, because the prophet saith, Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto men their Christ; he ought also to draw these words unto the mystery of the Lords incarnation: and he expoundeth thunder to be the words of the Lord, and spirit to be the reasonable and perfect soul. But the former interpretation is certain and convenient with the words of the prophet, by whom there is no mention made of Christ; but the power of God is set forth in his works. Behold (saith the prophet) he that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, which maketh the morning darknesse, and walketh upon the high places of the earth, the Lord God of hosts is his name.

And yet it is not to be supposed that a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people was not present, and the disciples of Christ likewise; but the word <hi>Solus,</hi> alone, is referred to the womans accusers, who withdrew themselves away every one, and departed. In the sixt of <hi>Mark</hi>; when it was evening, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon land: he was not alone upon land or shore, for the same was not utterly void of dwellers; but he had not any of his disciples with him, nor any body to carry him a shipboard unto his disciples.

When as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the son alone is said to know the father, and it is demanded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holy spirit is debarred from knowing the father; out of other places of scriptures judgement is to be given in this case.

                  <note n="8" place="margin">Answer. How the spirit is sent.</note> Whereto I answer first, that he which is sent is not alwayes lesser than he that sendeth: to prove which position any mean wit may inferre many instances, Furthermore, touching the sending of the holy spirit, we are here to imagin no changing or shifting of place. For if the spirit when he goeth from the Father and is sent, changeth his place, then must the Father also be in a place, that he may leave it and goe to another. And as for the incomprehensible nature of the spirit, hee cannot leaving his place passe unto another. Therefore the sending of the spirit is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and unvariable will of God, to doe something by the holy spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the revealing and executing of this will by the operation and working of the spirit. The spirit was sent to the Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which spirit was present with them, sith it is present every-where; but then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of God the Father hee shewed himselfe present and powerfull.</p>
               <p>Some man may say; if sending be a revealing and laying open of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and power, then may the Father be said to be sent, because hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is also revealed. I answer, that when the spirit is said to be sent, not only the revealing, but the order also of his revealing is declared; because the will of the Father and of the Son, of whom he is sent, going before, not in time, but in order of persons, the spirit doth reveal himself, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and also the Son. The Father revealeth himself by others, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, so that his will goeth before. Therefore sending is the common work of all the three persons; howbeit, for order of doing, it is distinguished by diverse names. The Father will reveal himself unto men with the son and the spirit and be powerfull in them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is said to send. The sonne doth assent unto the will of the Father, and will that to bee done by themselves, which God will to be done by them; these are said to be sent. And because the will of the Son doth goe before the spirit in order of persons; he is also said to send the Spirit.</p>

As for <hi>Hermes Trismegistus,</hi> he saith that all things have need of this spirit; for according to his worthinesse he supporteth all, he quickeneth and sustein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all, and he is derived from the holy fountaine, giving breath and life unto all, and evermore remaineth continuall, plentifull, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptyed.</p>
               <p>And here by the way I give you a note worth reading and considering; namely, how all nations in a manner, by a kinde of heavenly influence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in writing and speaking the name of God with no more than foure letters.<note place="margin">

This although it be not so proper to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose, (yet because we are in hand with the holy spirits deity) is not altogether impertinent. But why God would have his name as it were universally bounded within the number of four letters, I can give sundry reasons, which requires too long a discourse of words by digression and therefore I will conceal them for this time. These opinions of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers I have willingly remembred, that it might appear, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning the Holy Spirit is very ancient; which they have taken either out of <hi>Moses</hi> writings, or out of the works of the old fathers, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and set forth in books, though not wholly, fully, and perfectly understood and known; and also that our <hi>Pneumatomachi</hi> may see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be more doltish in divine matters than the heathen, who will not acknowledge that essentiall and working power of the divinity whereby all things are quickned: which the heathen did after a sort see; after a sort (I say) because they separated the soul of the world (which they also call the begotten mind) from the most soveraign and unbegotten God, and imagined certain differences of degrees, and (as <hi>Cyrill</hi> saith) did Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize in the Trinity.</p>
               <p>So then I conclude against these <hi>Pneumatomachi,</hi> that in so much as they imitate the old gyants,<note place="margin">

For there is nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, nothing more monstrous, then against the person of the deity (I mean the spirit of sanctification) to oppose mans power, mans wit, mans policy, &amp;c. which was well signified by that poeticall fiction of the giants, who were termed <hi>Anguipedes,</hi> Snakefooted; which as <hi>Ioachimus Camera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> expoundeth of wicked counsellours, to whose filthy perswasions ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants doe trust as unto their feet; and <hi>Iames Sadolet</hi> interpreteth of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, who trusting over much unto their own wits, become so bold in challenging praise for their wisdome, that in fine all turneth to folly and confusion; so I expound of heretikes and schismatikes, who' either by corrupt doctrine, or by maintaining precise opinions, or by open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, &amp;c. assay to overthrow the true religion, to break the unity of the church, to deny <hi>Caesar</hi> his homage, and God his duty, &amp;c. and therefore let <hi>Iovis fulmen,</hi>
