            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>May it please your Lordship, and you that are sworn, the Prisoner stands charged, That he being a false Traytor to the King, and intending to raise War and Rebellion against the King, and to bring his Majesty to an untimely death, did on the second of <hi>March</hi> in the Five and Thirtieth year of the King, at the Parish of S. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Bassishaw,</hi> meet with other Traytors like himself, and there conspired to bring these Treasons to effect; and accordingly promised to be aiding and assisting to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Arms for it; and did actually provide several Arms, as Carbines, Blunderbusses and Pistols for the perpetrating this Treason. This is the Charge, to which he says he is Not Guilty. We will call our Witnesses and prove it, and then you are to find it.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the Prisoner at the Bar is accused of the highest of Crimes, High Treason against his Sovereign Lord, in compassing the Murder of the King, in raising Rebellion within this Kingdom, to the overthrowing of the best constituted, and the most excellent Government in the World. Gentlemen, he does not stand alone; and therefore he is charged in the Indictment with a Conspiracy with many others: I am heartily sorry to say there are many; indeed there is hardly any Kingdom or Nation, wherein there are not discontented persons, whose narrow Fortunes or malevolent Spirits render them uneasie in that condition God Almighty hath put them; but to find men that pretend to be Christians, or to have any thing of Virtue, and under the best of Governments, that indeed is a matter of wonder; and indeed it casts so great a stain and reproach upon the Protestant Name, that it is not to be wiped off, but by the severest Justice of the Kingdom. Gentlemen, this design was for a general Rising, and at the same time to assassinate the King and the Duke, of <hi>York:</hi> this is the design which the whole course of our Evidence will open to you, and lies so naked, that I hope no <hi>Englishman</hi> that lives, but will see through these men, that have made such a noise and tumult in these latter dayes. This design to assassinate the King, and the Rising, was designed to be in <hi>October</hi> last, upon the King's Return from <hi>New-Market</hi>; and at that time there was a Noble Lord, that is gone now to his own place, as will appear by the Evidence, that furnished them with considerable summs of money, for the providing Men and Arms for the assassinating the King at that time, but the Assassinates were not then ready, as God appointed they should not be ready; and so at that time they were disappointed. Then the general Rising was put off till Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s day, which will open your eyes to see upon what grounds those Tumultuous Meetings were encouraged in the City, to the terror of all honest men: but that Rising was also disappointed, because some of the Conspirators were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93094:3"/>
not ready with their Men in the Countrey: and then, Gentlemen, though it was prest on by the person I mentioned, he then thought it high time to leave these Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates to themselves. Gentlemen, after this we shall trace them in their several Meetings and Consultations: for there was a time that they struggled with themselves; which should be effected first, whether they should first kill the King and the Duke; or whet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>r they should first rise, and so prosecute him in an open Rebellion, and destroy him that way. And the course of our evidence will shew how ingenious these men were; for it appears, there were men of great ingenuity and courage, as appears by the Prisoner at the Bar; and they would discourse of these matters in Phrates, that common persons should not understand them—</p>

                  <p>I speak as loud as I can. At their meetings, for cutting off the King; that was <hi>the executing of a Bargain and Sale</hi>; and <hi>a short conveyance,</hi> to come to their end. The raising of a War, that was under the notion, and so to be discourst of, of <hi>executing a Lease and Release, to work both upon the possession and upon the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi> and under these mystical terms they discourst of all these subjects, when they were in publick places.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>You will hear the Witnesses, and that will concern you more. Then Gentlemen, in these several meetings they contrived to allot every man his part, some were to provide Arms, others were to provide men, to do the execution, which was last resolved upon to be at the <hi>Rye,</hi> upon the Kings last return from <hi>New-Market.</hi> Gentlemen, in all these parts, which I hope to prove, the Prisoner will appear to have a principal part in them all: In all the Consultations and Advisings for the raising men, wherein he was to be a principal Commander, according to the skill he hath; but for the Assassination at the <hi>Rye, Rumbold</hi> was to conduct the Men hired for that purpose. Gentlemen, accordingly the time was appointed for his Majesty to come, and the Assassinates to meet him there: but it pleased God, that that was disappointed by a miraculous Fire, for so all <hi>Englishmen</hi> may call it: and whereas they were to go down on <hi>Friday</hi> to <hi>Rumbold</hi>'s House, and the King to come up on <hi>Saturday,</hi> the Fire brought him to Town on <hi>Tuesday</hi>: but notwithstanding this great Providence to divert them, <hi>Rumbold</hi> and others of the Confederates, resolved to go on with it still; and several places were appointed, and several Officers appointed to view those places, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> and <hi>Windsor,</hi> or else to do it at the <hi>Play-house,</hi> or upon the Kings passage from the <hi>Play-house</hi> by <hi>Bedford-wall</hi> at <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>; but if these should fail, they were resolved to do it at the <hi>Bull-feast.</hi> Gentlemen, they went further; they provided Arms; which very Arms opportunely fell into our hands: we seised those very Arms that were bought for that purpose to kill the King and the Duke. We shall go through with it; I will name you the material places of their meetings, that so you may understand the Witnesses; the <hi>Green-Dragon</hi> Tavern on <hi>Snow-hill,</hi> the <hi>Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> Tavern in <hi>Lumbard-street,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> Tavern near the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and Mr. <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber in the <hi>Middle Temple</hi>; these were some of the principal places, though they had several other places, wherein all these matters were consulted and transacted. They had prepared a new Model of Government, and they were for overturning all, as all these Politicians do; though they had a most excellent Government, yet they had a better in their own brains; or at least; their share would be greater in it, as all Rebels have a prospect of. Gentlemen, for the other parts, we shall have less occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to give evidence of now, for every one had their particular part; some for the great design of the rising, some for the killing of the King, whereof that Gentleman, the Prisoner, was one; and there were other parts assign'd to others, for taking and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing the <hi>Tower.</hi> We will call our Witnesses, and prove all that we have opened, and make it as clear to you as the Sun shines: such a prodigious Villany, nothing but a firebrand from Hell could kindle in me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s minds, to kill the best of Kings, and to destroy the best Frame of Government. Gentlemen, I do not question your Justice, but that this man shall pay what is due to the Justice of the Kingdom.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, Mr. Attorney hath already given you an account of the design that was to be put in execution by a parcel of evil men, whereof the Prisoner at the Bar we charge to be one. We shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93094:4"/>
you longer with opening the matter, but beg the favour of the Court, that we may acquaint you a little with the method we intend to follow in calling our Evidence for the King against the Prisoner at the Bar. In the first place, my Lord, we will call our Witnesses, to give your Lordship and the Jury satisfaction, That there was a design in general, and that that design was first intended to be a general Rising over all the Kingdom; in which design the Prisoner at the Barr had a very considera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> share, and was looked upon to be a very proper and fit person for the managery of that part of the design: For other meetings, and at what places, <hi>Mr. Attorney</hi> hath already opened to you. We will then come to more particular agreements that were between them, in order to the carrying on this admirable good work, as it hath been truly sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the destruction of the best and most merciful of Kings, and for the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the best of Religions, the Religion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I take notice of it, because all men may know, The most of these persons, nay, all of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this hellish Conspiracy, were Dissenters from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the better to effect this horrid villany (I am sure I want words, and so does any man else, to express the baseness of these crimes) the better to effect this thing, the way it was to be done, was by taking off the King, and by taking off his Brother too. At length after several debates and some proposals made between these persons, they came to a determination and an actual resolution, To take off the King and his Royal Brother. My Lord, we will prove generally, that this was the intent of the design or the Plot in general. My Lord, we will then give you an account, That they entred into several consultations for a new model and frame of Government; for they intended to set up the people, and they had even fixt a certain superiority, and resolved as all people of their principles have a mind, according to their several incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to fix the power in the people; Gentlemen, an old Tenent, that brought the Kings Father to that untimely and horrid end, by fixing the power in the people. These Gentlemen had a mind to insinuate and ingage the people, by fixing the power in them, and saying that publick Proclamations were to be made. And after this horrid and barbarous murder, intended upon the King and the Duke, there were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations to be made in the names of such and such Lords, and the Associating Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the last House of Commons, these were the persons thought fit in whose hands the power of the whole Kingdom should be lodged. Gentlemen, after we have given you an account of the several meetings, then we will come to the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the Bar, and prove against him, That he had not only an hand in the first part of the plot, about the rising, but he was also to be one of those villains that were to murder the King: I cannot express my self in more moderate Terms, and I am sure no man can blame me that hears the proof. Gentlemen, when we have thus given you this Evidence, I hope we shall satisfie the Court, and all mankind, That persons that have been thus guilty, under pretence of Religion, or under any other pretence whatsoever, are fit objects of the severity of humane Laws. If we prove against the Prisoner at the Bar, That he had an hand in this horrid Conspiracy, I make no doubt but you will shew your selves to be <hi>Englishmen,</hi> loyal men, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take all men that thirst after the Kings blood.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen, we will call our Witnesses, and as no man can doubt, but the murder of the King, that vile design, would have been seconded by a power to back that horrid villany; so we shall shew you, That this Gentleman was concerned in both parts, in the immediate assassination of the King, and the raising of Arms. We need not go about to give you an history of the thing any other way than in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to this person, for there is no part of this Conspiracy he can clear himself from, and all the evidence that speak of this design, speak of this man as a chief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in it.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, he said, there was no dependance upon those Gentlemen that met, and he would leave <hi>England.</hi> After that a Fortnight or three Weeks, there was a meeting one day at Mr. <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber, and there was Mr. <hi>West,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> and some body else there was, but I cannot remember his Name, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Walcot</hi> was in <hi>Holland</hi> then. There it was proposed, nothing was to be done by a general Rising; but there was no surer way than to take off the King and the Duke; and that to that intent and purpose, they could not carry it on without Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi>; and so he was writ for into <hi>Holland</hi>; and he came out of <hi>Holland</hi> upon that Letter, and Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> with him. After Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s coming back from <hi>Holland,</hi> there was very suddenly a meeting again, and then it was concluded, that nothing was to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without taking off the K. and D. or to that purpose. Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> was not at that Meeting. There were two or three Meetings before Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> was there, to find out men, and they could not find out a number of men, without which Mr. <hi>Rumbold</hi> would not undertake it. So about three or four meetings after Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> came, and he was resolved at last to join in the matter; but he would not have an hand in attacking the Coach, but he would command a Party that should charge the Guards.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>The beginning of it was in <hi>February.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Last <hi>February?</hi>

                  <p>Last <hi>February.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> and Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> came to this Town upon <hi>Ash-wednesday.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. S. Jeffreys.</speaker>
                  <p>What other meetings were you at, Sir?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>This was the first, when the Prisoner at the Bar came in. The first time was at Mr. <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber, where he came: There it was considered and debated.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. S. Jeffreys.</speaker>
                  <p>Very well, you say that was the first time Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> came in.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>It was at Mr. <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber: This was before the King came from <hi>New-Market,</hi> that they were to do this, and the number of men could not be got rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; so there were several meetings afterward at Mr. <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber, to consult whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could raise the number they resolved upon; and there were Notes brought by Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rumbold</hi> of many names, I cannot say who else brought notes of the mens names, to see that they might not be deceived in the number: and at that time, Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> was there, and did undertake to go to Mr. <hi>Rumbold</hi>'s house, and I think did go down to the very place.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Look you, Sir, was there any number of men insisted upon for doing this villany?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>Capt. <hi>Rumbold</hi> did insist upon 50. men.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>But Capt. <hi>Walcot,</hi> how many was he to have?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>It was not divided to a perfect number.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. S. Jeffreys.</speaker>
                  <p>What other meetings were you at with Captain <hi>Walcot?</hi>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>I was at the Salutation with him, and the green Dragon with him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. S. Jeffreys.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>The green Dragon is upon <hi>Snow-Hill.</hi>

                  <speaker>Mr. S. Jeffreys.</speaker>
                  <p>Where is the Salutation?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>In <hi>Lumbard-street.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. S. Jeffreys.</speaker>
                  <p>Now tell what discourses you had there.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>That was about dividing the City into 20 parts, to see how many men could be raised out of every part, and they were to be divided into fifteenths, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to lead a fifteenth, that they might not be at a loss.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Who was intrusted with this to do it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> Mr. <hi>West,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wade.</hi>
                  </p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>What account did they give of what they had done?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>M. <hi>Goodenough</hi> gave an account of 7 parts of the 20. and said out of them would be raised 2900 men, and made an estimate that the other 13. would not raise above as many more, for those were the most considerable parts, as <hi>Wapping</hi> and <hi>Southwark.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. S. Jeffreys.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ramsey,</hi> Pray what consultation had you afterward, and what was done after?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray let us go on a little <hi>gradatim,</hi> What was the reason that this was not effected when the King returned from <hi>New-Market?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>The fire happened, and brought the King sooner from <hi>New-Market</hi> than the men could be got ready.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Was there a day appointed for the doing this? had you a prospect when the King would return?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, it was commonly talked that it would be the <hi>Saturday</hi> before <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> but he came on the <hi>Tuesday</hi> before.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Then give us an account how that design was disappointed at that time.</p>

                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>The fire happened in <hi>New-Market,</hi> and they were all in a confusion, and could not get their men ready by <hi>Tuesday</hi>; the news came upon <hi>Friday</hi> to Town.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Of the fire?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>Of the fire, and there was a meeting. Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> lodged then in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and sent to several to come to him, to see if men could be got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against <hi>Tuesday,</hi> when the King was to come in, and it could not be done, and it was laid aside for that time.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Upon that what resolution was taken?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>Then they had a meeting, and <hi>Ferguson</hi> was not there, there was Cap. <hi>Walcot,</hi> Mr. <hi>West</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi>; this was immediately after this disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am not certain whether it was in Mr. <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber: and that there might no accident happen afterwards to hinder it, it was resolved that money should be raised for the buying of Arms, and Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> undertook to raise money to buy Arms, and Mr. <hi>West</hi> did undertake to provide them.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Look you, Colonel <hi>Rumsey,</hi> after this disappointment, when this next meeting was, had you any further design upon the King then?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Give us some account of that.</p>

                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>It was to be done a coming from <hi>Windsor</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> or from <hi>Windsor</hi> to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> or the <hi>Play-House,</hi> and therefore that Arms should be ready against any opportunity that should happen, let it be what it would; and Mr. <hi>West</hi> did undertake to provide Arms, and he told me he bought them, and did not get his mony in six or seven weeks after, a day or two after going to <hi>Ferguson,</hi> he told him now he might have his money, if he would send a Note to Major <hi>Wildman</hi>; but after he was told, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Wildman</hi> would not pay it by Note, but he must send Mr. <hi>Rumbold</hi> to him for it, for he would trust no body else but him. And so Mr. <hi>West</hi> did send Mr. <hi>Rumbold,</hi> and he was there at his house by six a clock in the morning, but he was gone out of Town an hour before, so Mr. <hi>West</hi> went to Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> and he then told him that he should have money in two or three days, if he would come to him, and Mr. <hi>West</hi> did go to him, and he paid him an hundred pound.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Was there any provision made for a Rising now again?</p>

                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, this general Rising, by this division of the City, was intended to be ready against the first opportunity that hapned.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Before this Discovery, did you keep up these Meetings?</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I think it was the very Thursday before the Discovery; but then on Friday or Saturday, we had inklings that this was discovered, and did meet at the <hi>George</hi> upon <hi>Ludgate Hill.</hi>

                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>The Resolution was still to carry it on. We went thither to know of. Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> what was done about the other thirteen parts, he told us he had no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but he said, he thought he should have a Meeting on Saturday in the afternoon at <hi>Ludgate-Hill,</hi> at the <hi>George,</hi> to have his answer, but the Discovery coming, there did only meet Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bourne</hi>; there was another, I don't know who the other was, there was a fourth.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> was he that made the Discovery.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I have sufficient Evidence against that.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. S. Jeffries.</speaker>
                  <p>I think that he was to undertake the Guards, that was before the King came from <hi>Newmarket.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, I will give one Instance more: There was one Meeting at the <hi>Five Bells</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where there was only <hi>Ferguson,</hi> Captain <hi>Rumbold, Mr. West, Goodenough,</hi> and my self: And <hi>Mr. Ferguson</hi> told us that Night, that Captain <hi>Walcott</hi> would come the next Meeting we had at <hi>Mr. West</hi>'s Chamber.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Then Captain <hi>Walcott</hi> was not with you at the <hi>Five Bells?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> told us he would come in the next time at <hi>Mr. West</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and there he did come.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>And that was before the King went to <hi>Newmarket.</hi> Pray, Sir, answer this, Was this before the King went to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> or not?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Rumsey.</speaker>
                  <p>No, my Lord, this was, when he was at <hi>Newmarket</hi>; for the King was at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> when he and Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> came from <hi>Holland,</hi> the King was then at <hi>Newmarket.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Now we will call Mr. <hi>Keeling.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>(<hi>Who was sworn.</hi>)</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray will you acquaint my Lord, and the Jury, what you know of these Conspiracies, and touching this man.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Keeling.</speaker>
                  <p>Some time my Lord, before the King went to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> I was at the <hi>Sun-Tavern,</hi> and in company with <hi>Richard Rumbold, Richard Goodenough,</hi> and some others; <hi>Goodenough</hi> calls me forth of the Room, and asked me what Men I could procure? I asked him, For what purpose? He said, To go down towards <hi>Newmarket.</hi> I asked, For what end? He said, To kill the King, and the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> I told him, I thought none. Before the King came from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> he renewed his Question to me again seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times: I had, in the <hi>interim,</hi> some discourse with <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>Thomson; Burton</hi> told me, That <hi>Barbor</hi> would be concern'd; and he also told me, <hi>Thomson</hi> would. The Saturday after the Fire hapned at <hi>Newmarket, Rumbold</hi> came down to my House, or the Friday, the day that the News was of the Fire, the day that he commonly came to Town, he came to my House; it was on the Friday, to see those men I could procure, and he desired to see them on the morrow, which was the Saturday before the King returned; the Saturday after the Fire, I went into <hi>London,</hi> and met Mr. <hi>Rumbold</hi> that day at the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and he then put me in mind of the matter again. I did go to <hi>Burton,</hi> and <hi>Thomson,</hi> and <hi>Barbor,</hi> the place appointed on <hi>Saturday</hi> was the <hi>Mitre-Tavern</hi> at the corner of <hi>Dukes-place</hi> within <hi>Aldgate.</hi> He did meet there, where there was some discourse hapned tending to that matter by <hi>Rumbold</hi>; the substance of which was, Whether they were willing to go down? I think he call'd the Place by the name of, <hi>The Rye,</hi> that is his House; there being, says he, no greater conveniency than in that, I believe scarce in <hi>England</hi> for the executing such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, being an House very intire to it self, and very remote from Neighbors, besides the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that belongs to it of a Court or Wall. And, among other discourse, this was an

Argument to prevail with those persons: For, saith he, it will be a keeping one of the Commandments, to kill the King, and the Duke of <hi>York</hi>; for, says he, if that be not done, there will be otherwise a great deal of Bloodshed committed. He also told us the way that he design'd to effect this at his House; That he had a conveniency for our Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and that there would be so many appointed to shoot at the Postillon and the Horses; and that there would be so many appointed at the Coach, and so many Men to attaque the Guards: And if there was a Failure in shooting the Coach-Horses, that then there should be Men in the habit of Country-men, with a Cart in the Lane, and they should run this Cart athwart the Lane, and so stop the Coach. I believe there might be some other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which, at present, I do not remember. From thence we went to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and there we met in the Afternoon at the <hi>Dolphin-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Bartholomew-lane,</hi> there was <hi>Rumbold, West, Goodenough,</hi> and <hi>Hone</hi> the Joyner. And after we had been there a little, <hi>West</hi> asked <hi>Rumbold,</hi> Whether he heard the King would come home that Night? Ho said, Yes, he heard so; but, said <hi>West,</hi> I believe he won't come till <hi>Monday,</hi> and I hope he won't come till <hi>Saturday,</hi> for that was the day appointed to go down to <hi>Rye,</hi> to meet the King, and the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> Said <hi>Rumbold,</hi> I hope they will not come till then: But, said <hi>West,</hi> if they do come, How many <hi>Swan-quills</hi> must you have? How many <hi>Goose-quills?</hi> And how many <hi>Crows-quills,</hi> with <hi>Sand</hi> and <hi>Ink,</hi> must you have? Said they, <hi>Six Swan-quills, Twenty Goose-quills,</hi> and <hi>Twenty or thirty Crow-quills.</hi>

                  <p>I am coming to it.

                  <p>I was at the <hi>Salutation</hi> Tavern and Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> was there, and when I came in, there was some person called me <hi>Culing,</hi> and I a little stranged at it, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaning; says I, Gentlemen, what do you design by it? says one, here's a good health to our English <hi>Culing</hi>; says <hi>West Culing</hi> in Dutch is <hi>Keeling</hi> in English, and says Mr. <hi>West,</hi> I hope to see Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> at the head of as good an Army in <hi>Wapping</hi> as <hi>Culing</hi> is at <hi>Collen.</hi> I suppose Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> remembers it very well.

                  <speaker>Mr. Keeling,</speaker>
                  <p>If your Lordship please I will give you an account. There was something happened before that time. Some time before this thing was discovered, <hi>Goodenough</hi> came down to my house, and I went with him to drink a dish of Coffee, and there was in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him <hi>Richard Rumbold,</hi> and his Brother <hi>William</hi>; that I believe <hi>Mr. Walcot</hi> knows; and when we were by our selves, he pulls out some papers out of his pocket, and gave me one; I asked him what he meant; he told me he had divided the City and Suburbs into twenty parts, and there was three divisions; and says he, you know the persons better than I, and who you can trust with it; one is for your self, and I would have you take to your assistance nine or ten men, more or less, that you can communicate it safely to, and they were to go to several persons, and ask them, supposing that the Papists should rise, or that there should be a general Insurrection, or a <hi>French</hi> Invasion, Are you in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of defence? This was all we were to communicate of the matter to them, and this was to feel them, and see how many men they could raise. And he told me there was a design to kill the King and the Duke, which was design'd to be done at the Bull-feast, for Mr. <hi>West</hi> had told me it was to be done between <hi>Windsor</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi> I asked him if that Design went on, and he said no; for the Duke of <hi>York</hi> seldom came with the King from <hi>Windsor</hi> to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> but it was to be at the Bull-Feast. And says he, these men are to be in a readiness, and its designed that the thing should be laid upon the Papists, as a branch of the Popish Plot. He also told me, there was one drawing a Declaration, which would relieve poor people of that which seemed most burthensome to them, which was the Chimney-money, and then the Common People would fall in with them more readily.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Keeling.</speaker>
                  <p>I will tell you, Sir, I was troubled in my mind about it, and do declare that was the only Reason; I thought I did very ill in not discovering it and I had no peace nor satisfaction, nor content, nor did I mind my business, nor could I take that rest that at other times I did, and that was the moving Cause, and no other. I thought if it were a Sin in <hi>David</hi> to cut off the Hem of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garment, it was a Sin in me much more to kill my King.</p>

                  <p>I had offered to discover it to another man before, but I thought he was careless, so I did not tell him positively what I thought to tell him, because I saw he slighted the matter, he was a Minister of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Then I went to <hi>Mr. Peckham,</hi> knowing he was intimate at Court, and from thence to my Lord <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and then I was carried to <hi>Mr.</hi> Secretary <hi>Ienkins.</hi>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> brought an account of about four thousand; three I think it was, or very near, out of those Divisions he had an account of.</p>

                  <p>Yes, at some of them, and Captain <hi>Walcott</hi> was at three of them, if not at all, I think.</p>

                  <p>Yes, Mr. <hi>West</hi> did say to me, it should be my business to secure my Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. I told him, I did not care to meddle with any of my neighbours.

                  <p>I would have spoke to two of them, and Mr. <hi>West</hi> was unwilling, for he said the Ministers had destroyed all designs ever since <hi>Constantines</hi> time, and he would have nothing to do with them now.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Bourne.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly they resolved upon nothing, I left them upon the debate of killing Mr. <hi>Keeling.</hi>

                  <p>I did hear of it, my Lord, when the thing was over. And as to his question, I did never hear him discourse of that matter. I understood the design was prevented.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Bourne.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. West.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I came acquainted with the Prisoner at the Bar last Summer, Vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the knowledge of one <hi>Wilcocks,</hi> who, I suppose, return'd his mony out of <hi>Ireland.</hi> I heard a very fair Character of him, and he, I suppose, met with such an one of me, which did incline us both to an Intimacy, and to talk freely with one another. About the middle of <hi>October,</hi> I observ'd a general Discontent in the City, and was afraid there was some Design in hand, and was very inquisitive to know it: I was unwilling to be involved and surprized into a sudden Ruine, and so thought fit to inquire of them that were most likely to be concerned. I took Capt. <hi>Walcott</hi> for one, being inform'd that my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> had sent for him out of <hi>Ireland</hi>; and Capt. <hi>Walcott</hi> told me, that my Lord was also sending for some <hi>Scottish</hi> Gentlemen, on occasion of <hi>Carolina</hi>; but that he was very cool in <hi>Carolina</hi> business, and that that was but a Pretence. My Lord, one morning Capt. <hi>Walcott</hi> came to my Chamber, and we discours't concerning the Election of Sheriffs carried on in the City, contrary, as we thought, to the Justice of it: Says he, Will the People do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to secure themselves? With that he told me a Secret, and said there was a Design of an Insurrection to be made within three Weeks, or a Month, that would make us free, or worse. I told him, I thought it was a certain way to bring us into a worse condition, and that it was very full of hazards. He told me then, he did not know whether he should be concerned: But a little while after he told me, my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was engag'd in such a Design, and he had engag'd him in it; and he told me, he had an expectation of being a Colonel of Horse, and ask'd me, If I would have any Command under him? I told him, I knew some Gentlemen of the <hi>Temple</hi> that I might engage in it, but I told him I had not a Constitution to bear the Toils of War. My Lord, he told me then, That my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> to the best of my remembrance, had another Design upon the King, and the Duke, as they came from <hi>Newmarket</hi> in <hi>October</hi> last, but he told me he abhorr'd any such thing, it was ungenerous, and he would not be concern'd in it, but only in a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. But this he did tell me, I think, before the thing was to be executed; I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted it to no Body, till after the time of both was past: But in the discourse of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, he told me, I should lend him a Suit of Silk Armour, which I bought about 4 or 5 years ago, when the Popish Plot broke out, and he would have had me kept that, and used it my self, which I did decline. Then he told me, he had very good Swords in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but he wanted them here. Says he, I am a man that am observed, because I have a Correspondence with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and asked me, If I would provide him a good stiff Tuck?

                  <p>Now after this I understood by Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> that Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> had the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and conduct of the Assassination in <hi>October,</hi> and that he likewise was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Insurrection, and was a great man in it. I met with Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> and fell into discourse with him, and he treated me, as he always did, with a long story of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the people were all in slavery and bondage, and would be so here if they did not free themselves; and says he, there are two ways thought upon for it, one is by a general Insurrection, and that is gone off; the other is a much more compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way, by killing the King and the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> My Lord, I told him, I thought the <hi>first</hi> way was a very dangerous way, that the people were in no sort of capacity to carry it on, that the Government had the <hi>Navy</hi> and the <hi>Militia,</hi> and this would at the best entail a long War. He told me he thought the other was the best way, and we went to a Tavern, where Col. <hi>Rumsey,</hi> and one <hi>Row,</hi> and he and I went divers times. They proposed to meet at my Chamber as a place of privacy and little observation. My Lord, when they came to my Chamber, Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> proposed several ways of doing it. One way was as the King and Duke had their private visits in St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, where it was an easie thing for Sword-men to kill them. There is one thing I have omitted, and that was after the design of <hi>October</hi> had miscarried, I think, to the best of my remembrance, Capt. <hi>Walcott</hi> told me, there was another design of attaquing the King and the Duke at my Lord Mayors Feast in the Hall, or in their return home, in <hi>Pauls Church-yard,</hi> or at <hi>Ludgate:</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> did likewise tell me the same thing, but the King not dining there the thing was wholly disappointed. Another way that he proposed was, that they should do it as the King and Duke went down the River, they should lie behind some small Ships within a Hoy; or some such thing, and so overrun their Barge; and if that fail'd, they should break a plank with their Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbusses, and so sink them. Another way was at the Playhouse, and that was to be done in this manner; there should be 40 or 50 men got into the Pitt with Pocket Blunderbusses, or Hand Blunderbusses, and Pistols and Swords; and when the Musick struck up between the Acts, they should fire upon the Box; but this this they thought was hazardous, and therefore they thought it better to do it as he came back, and pitched upon <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> under <hi>Bedford-Garden</hi> Wall, because there was a conveniency for a great many men to walk in the <hi>Piazza,</hi> and there might be another parcel of men planted at <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Church Porch, and within the Rails where horses could not come; and while the men within the Rails fired, the men in the Piazza might ingage the Guards, and they in the Church Porch to come down and secure them from escaping.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. West.</speaker>
                  <p>I think it was before Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> went for <hi>Holland.</hi> And, my Lord, there was another thing propos'd; I think it was Colonel <hi>Rumsey</hi> did say, He wonder'd that the Lords and great Men that were so fond of the thing, did not raise a Purse, and buy some Body an Office, who should rail against the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the <hi>Whigs,</hi> and by that means get himself an opportunity of access to the King's person. My Lord, after these Discourses, when my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> retir'd to <hi>Holland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> thought fit to do so too: He was afraid of a Book that he had printed, and away he went, and Capt. <hi>Walcott</hi> with him. In the mean time I met Col. <hi>Rumsey</hi> several times, and several things were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, but nothing resolv'd upon. A little after <hi>Christmas</hi> we met at the <hi>Salutation-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Lumbard-street,</hi> and there it was agreed we should send for Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> and there I writ a canting Letter, that he should come over for his health, for he was the only man that could manage the Affair. When he came over, there was one Meeting at the <hi>Five Bells,</hi> but I came in just as they were coming away, and cannot say what past there. After that they came several times to my Chamber, and there Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rumbold,</hi> undertook to provide the men.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. West.</speaker>
                  <p>The Men for the Assassination: That I was not concern'd in, either in Person or Purse, or to procure any Body for it. And they did agree to do it in the going to or from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and thereupon were several Debates, Whether it should be done at their Going, or Coming Back. Against doing it Going Down, it was objected, That the Guards were left here and there, and they went together, but very often they return apart, and therefore it was not the safest way Going Down; and nothing also being prepar'd, so it was resolv'd to be done Coming Back. Then it was consider'd what Arms should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: Mr. <hi>Rumbold</hi> was the Man to manage that matter, and was to procure some Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busses,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93094:9"/>
some Carbines, and some Pistolls; but there was nothing to be prepar'd as I know of by other persons, but every Man was to provide himself. Several Meetings there were, they brought their Notes, and conferr'd together about the Men, but I remember no Names, but <hi>Keeling</hi> and <hi>Burton:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> said, he had spoke to one <hi>Hone</hi> a Joyner; and, I think, he spake of one <hi>Manning,</hi> and these are all the Names I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. After they had conferr'd their Notes, I ask'd Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> What provisions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he had made? Says he, I shall have Mony when the Men are provided, but not till then: For, said he, the last time there was some Mony rais'd, and put into a Man's hand, who never returned it, but since I understand it was paid to Mr. <hi>Goodenough.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guson</hi> said, Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> call'd him Fool, for returning some Mony he had, and not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for his own use; and my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had often complain'd of that Injustice done him: The Colonel said, Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi> should pay the Mony. There was a further Debate, How these Arms should be got down to Mr. <hi>Rumbolds</hi>; It was proposed, to send them down by <hi>Smithfield</hi> Carts in Chests. Others, to send them down by trusty Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were to cover them with Oysters. Others, that the Men should carry them; but no Resolution taken: Then it was consider'd, how they should get off. The next thing was, how they should execute this; and it was propos'd, That one Party was to fall upon the Coach-Horses, a second upon the Coach, a third upon the Guards: Captain <hi>Walcott</hi> would not undertake any thing but the Guards.</p>

                  <p>To <hi>Rumbold</hi>'s House; I did not see it: But he said he could keep them all private, where no Body could see them, till the time of the Execution. And that there was a Gate they were to pass through, that he could shut upon the Horse-Guards, that they should not be able to come in for their Relief. Mr. <hi>Rumbold</hi> said, he would bring them off; and said, he thought it dangerous for them to go the Road-way, but he would bring them over the Meadows, and come in by <hi>Hackney Marsh:</hi> But the way which the Prisoner did most approve of, was, That they should retire within his Wall, there keep till Night, being a Place they could defend against any Force for a days time.</p>

                  <p>This Resolution was taken at my Chamber. My Lord, As to the Attempt, when they design'd to make it upon the King's coming from the <hi>Play-house,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Row</hi> said, he had discours'd with one <hi>Gibbons,</hi> that was the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Servant, about it, and ask'd him, If any of their Family knew of it?

My Lord, in one of the Discourses I had before <hi>Mr. Ferguson</hi> went for <hi>Holland,</hi> I had a mind to be rid of the thing, but I did not know how; so I created difficulties, and said, I suppose the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> is to get most by it, what Security will you have you shall not be hang'd when the thing is done? He is bound, said I, in Honour, to hang us all, and make Inquisition for this Blood, otherwise they will say he is a Party. Says he, What if I get it under his Hand? But, said I, engage his Servants, and that will stick upon him. There is one thing I have omitted, which was in the first Discourse with Capt. <hi>Walcott</hi> about the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, says he, I would have several People draw it, to pick one good one out of all. And he told me he had made some Collections towards it, and shew'd me a Paper, which was a Collection of all the Passages in the Three Kings Reigns, K. <hi>Iames, Charles</hi> I. and this Kings, that he call'd Attempts to introduce Arbitrary Government and Popery; and concluded, taxing them with some personal Vices, and that the Government was dissolved, and they were free to settle another Government: These, I perceiv'd, were the Topicks my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> laid weight upon. I told him that this did require an exact knowledge of the History of those Times, and I would not undertake a thing to which I was not competent; and so he desir'd me to burn the Paper, which I did: But for any other Declaration, my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> kept his Paper to himself, and I never did see it, though I desir'd it.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. West.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I will tell you, when the News of the Fire came, they adjourned to my Chamber, and there considered what they should do; they were in no readiness, nor had any Horses: Nay, I believe the thing could not have been Effected, if the Fire had not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and I was very glad it could not; but for that, I am in the Charity of the Court. They did endeavour to put things in a posture, to see if it could be done another day; I think they met on <hi>Thursday</hi> Night, and <hi>Friday</hi> Night; but they said, the King would be at home the next day, and the thing was laid aside. <hi>My Lord,</hi> A day I think, or two after, I went into the City, and went to the <hi>Dolphin</hi> Tavern, where I met with Colonel <hi>Rumsey,</hi> and this Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> came in; he was there talking of Blunderbusses and Pistols in down-right English: I told him, it was a foolish thing to talk so before Drawers, and that was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of calling them by the Names of <hi>Swan-quills, Goose quills,</hi> and <hi>Crow-quills.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this thing we met the next Week, not at my Chamber, Col. <hi>Rumsey</hi> was mistaken in that, but at the <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Vulture:</hi> There was Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guson,</hi> one <hi>Norton</hi> and one <hi>Ayliff</hi>: They discours'd of the late Disappointment; and that one reason was, they had not Arms in readiness. Then they agreed, That Arms should be bought, and the Number was Ten Blunderbusses that should be twenty or two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inches in the Barrel. Thirty Carbines, eighteen inches. And Thirty Cases of Pistols to be Fourteen inches. <hi>My Lord,</hi> It was put upon me to provide them, for this reason, because I was serviceable to them no other way, and could have a pretence for buying them, because I had a Plantation in <hi>America</hi>; but Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> was to pay the Money. <hi>My Lord,</hi> I did bespeak the Arms, and paid for them with my own Money, and was not paid again a great while; Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> disappointed me: but at last told me, if I would send to Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> he would pay me. But he told me before that, one Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi> when he came to Town would pay me, but I had none of him. So <hi>I</hi> told him, I bought those Arms upon a pretence I intended to use them, and had spoke to a Sea-Captain to carry them off to a Plantation where I had a Concern my self. After that, Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> sent to me to take my Money, so I came to him; and found with him Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi> and another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whom I could not distinguish, because it was duskish; Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi> went down, and then says Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> I have your Money for you; and he paid me in Fourscore and thirteen Guinneys, which was something more than the Arms cost; and said, he had not the Mony above half an hour in his hands; by which I did guess, it was Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi>'s Money. Another thing was, at last meeting with Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> he did say, There was a Man imployed to see what conveniency there would be for an Assassination between <hi>Windsor</hi> and <hi>Hampt<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

But in case this Assassination had gone on, these things were to be done. It was Design'd, the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs should be kill'd, and as many of the Lieutenancy as they could get; and the Principal Ministers of State, My Lord <hi>Halifax,</hi> and My Lord <hi>Rochester</hi> that now is, and My Lord Keeper, for which they gave this Reason, because he had the Great Seal; and My Lord <hi>Rochester</hi> as like to stand by the Dukes Interest; and my Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> as being one that had Profest himself of the Party before, and turn'd from the Right side, and had put the Court up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which otherwise they would never have Acted, nor had the Courage to have done. As for My Lord Keeper, They said they would Hang him for the Murder of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and upon the same Post <hi>Colledge</hi> had hung. Sir <hi>Iohn Moor</hi> was to be Kill'd, and to be hung up in <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> as a betrayer of the Rights and Liberties of the City: And your Lordships to be Flead, and stuft, and hung up in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi>; and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Pentional Parliament hanged up, as Betrayers of the Rights of the People.</p>

He said, it was an action that would make all the Princes of the World tremble, and teach them to use their Subjects kindly. <hi>My Lord,</hi> they did design at the same time, when the Mayor and Sheriffs were to be kill'd, that Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> should be forced to take the Office of Sheriffs upon them; and if they would not take it, they would use them as they did the other: and that Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gold,</hi> or Sir <hi>Iohn Shorter,</hi> or Alderman <hi>Cornish,</hi> should be set up for Lord Mayor: but rather Alderman <hi>Cornish,</hi> as the fitter person. <hi>I</hi> asked them further, what they would do with the King's Natural Sons?

There was a Treaty between the <hi>Scots,</hi> and our Persons of Quality here, and Coll. <hi>Sidney</hi> and Major <hi>Wildman</hi> had the management of it, as <hi>I</hi> understood. At last, they came down to some Terms; They would have had 10000 <hi>l.</hi> to buy Arms, and came down at last to 5000 <hi>l.</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> was to Head them: but when Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> paid me for the Arms, he told me, The <hi>Scots</hi> business was quite off, and <hi>Wildman</hi> and <hi>Sidney</hi> haddone ill with the <hi>Scots</hi>; for after they had kept them, and treated with them Two or three Monrhs, they broke off because the <hi>Scots</hi> would not declare for a Commonwealth the first hour, and Extirpating of Monarchy, and the Family of the <hi>Stuarts:</hi> and that the <hi>Scots</hi> Answer was, That would be to Destroy all their Interest among the Lords; and Providence might orderit so, as to bring it to a Commonwealth, but that was a business of time. When this was broke off, Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> told me, That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was willing to speak with me. and <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and some others. <hi>I</hi> told him, <hi>I</hi> never had, nor was willing to speak with him. Then he said, Sir <hi>Thomas Armestrong</hi> would, <hi>I</hi> told him, <hi>I</hi> was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

to speak with him neither: Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> I believe, did speak with Sr. <hi>Thomas Armstrong.</hi> We met at <hi>Richard</hi>'s Coffee-house, and adjourn'd to the <hi>young Devil Tavern,</hi> there was Capt. <hi>Walcot,</hi> Col <hi>Rumsey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> and my self, and one <hi>Holloway</hi> a Merchant at <hi>Bristol.</hi> Mr. <hi>Holloway</hi> did propose, since the <hi>Scotch</hi> business was broke of, that they should try what forces they could raise here. And Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> did say, if three thousand men could be had, he believed the Duke of <hi>Momnouth</hi> and my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> would appear in the head of them. They were to divide the City into 20 parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> each 20<hi>th</hi> part into 14<hi>ths</hi> and 15<hi>ths,</hi> and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into Streets and Lanes; one Principal man was to have a 20<hi>th</hi> part, and to have men under him and that they should not interfere with one another, they bought a great <hi>Map</hi> of the City of <hi>London.</hi> My Lord, I did not read one line in it: but Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> being a man of publick acquaintance by reason of his Office did undertake it. I think he did propose Mr. <hi>Borne</hi> for one, and one Mr. <hi>Graines</hi> for another, and said he would speak with Mr. <hi>Keeling.</hi> We had several meetings after this, and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> did report that there were 1300 men out of two of the Hamlets. <hi>My Lord,</hi> I stood here while Mr. <hi>Bourne</hi> gave his Evidence; but I suppose he hath a little forgot himself, for he told me he had spoke to one Parson <hi>Lobb,</hi> and he said to him he would try what his Congregation could do; that he had two in <hi>Newprison,</hi> and he would set them out to see what they could do; that they were poor men, but zealous in their way. I think Mr. <hi>Bourne</hi> hath forgot himself, for he did mention that he had spoken to Parson <hi>Lobb.</hi>

                  <p>Yes, and did shew himself ready to act his part. About a fortnight before the Discovery brake out, Mr. <hi>Rombold</hi> told me they had a great jealousie Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> would Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all the business; that Mr. <hi>Keelings</hi> Wife and Mother cryed mightily, and charged him for neglecting his business; and said they were afraid he would do a great deal of mischeif to honest people, for he had replied to them he would not want money, and he would be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for no body; upon which <hi>Rombold</hi> told me, if I was sure of this, says he, I would dispatch him, I would get him into the Country and kill him; but saies he, I will not kill an innocent man; if I thought the thing was not so, I would not kill him for all the World.

                  <p>The <hi>Saturday</hi> before the Discovery, I dined with Mr. <hi>Rombold,</hi> and he took Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> along with him; saies he, We won't discourage him too much; it may be 'tis not so; Mr <hi>Keeling</hi> told him he never wanted money so much in his life; Mr. <hi>Rombold</hi> and one <hi>Gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When we were all retired, they got Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> in the City, and <hi>Rumbold</hi> discoursed him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of several people, where he wished a great many imprecations upon himself if he had Discovered. I told them I did not understand him; for if he had made a Discovery, it was a fine way to catch people in. Then there was a discourse of killing him; they proposed to him to go out of Town: he refused them, but said he would go in a few days; tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had not <hi>Keeling</hi> deceived them at that meeting at the Tavern by the protestations he made, some body had killed him there. Then Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> said, if the Duke of <hi>Mommouth</hi> would go into the West, we might try a push for it, and the Prisoner at the Bar said, I am satisfied God will deliver the Nation, tho he does not approve of the presen Instruments.</p>

                  <p>Your Judgment is now rectified; but what say you to the matter? for now you hear what is fastned upon you, that is, several Consults about the securing or killing of the King; and your advice was to kill him, and you did go down to <hi>Romball</hi>'s house, to view the place where it might be done the most securely; and you did undertake, as several Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses say, not only Mr. <hi>West,</hi> but <hi>Col Romsey</hi> and another of them (<hi>Bourne</hi> I think it was), That you would fight the Gaurds, if you might have a considerable number of men.</p>

                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> If ever I was at Mr. <hi>Romballs</hi> house, unless it was when I travelled from <hi>York</hi> by <hi>Norwich,</hi> and came to <hi>London</hi>; if ever I was there since, then I am Guilty of all the Roguery imaginable.</p>

                     <hi>My Lord, Mr. West,</hi> does tell your Lordship a very long story, and sometimes he names one Gentleman, and sometimes another. I am very fearful the <hi>Iury</hi> will be very apt to apply all to me, who was the man least concerned; for I had the <hi>Gout</hi> for several weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and <hi>Mr. West</hi> came several times to my own Lodging to see me: And for that of Assassinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King it never entred into my thoughts more or less; but here are four Gentlemen who by their own Confession are sufficiently culpable; they to wipe off their own stains, are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to Swear me out of my Life.</p>

                  <p>I did not stir for three weeks or a month.

                        <hi>I</hi> Being in the Country, and to my great trouble seeing my self in his Majesties Proclamation, I came last Night to Town, resolving to lay my self at his Majesties Feet, let him do with me what he pleaseth; This it the first Crime I have been Guilty of, since His Majestie's Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and too soon by much now: If his Majesty thinks my Death will do him more good than my Life, God's Will, and His be done. Vntil I sent your Honour this Letter, my Life was in my own power, but now it is in the Kings; to whom I do most humbly propose, That if his Majesty desires it, I will Discover to him all that I know relating to <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi>; which I suppose may be something more than the Original Discoverer was able to acquaint His Majesty with; especially as to <hi>Ireland:</hi> There is not any thing His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty shall think fit to ask me, but I will answer him the Truth, as pertinently and as fully as I can; My intimacy with a <hi>Scotch</hi> Minister, through whose Hands much of the Business went, I judge occasioned my knowing very much: And I do further humbly Propose, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I am sure as to that particular, if my being with His Majesty, and your Honour, be not Discovered, I shall be ten times abler to serve him, than either Mr. <hi>Freeman,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Carr,</hi> for they will trust neither of them. There's scarce any thing done at Court, but is immediately talk'd all the Town over; therefore if His Majesty thinks what I have presumed to propose, Advisable, I do then further most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Propose, That my waiting upon His Majesty may be some time within Night, that your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will acquaint me the Time and Place where I may wait upon you, in order to it; and that it may be within Night also, and that no body may be by, but his Majesty, and your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; And if His Majesty pleaseth to Pardon my Offences for the Time past, he shall find I will approve my self very Loyal for the future; if not, I Resolve to give His Majesty no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trouble, but to lie at his Mercy, let him do with me what he pleaseth. I purpose to spend much of this Day in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> at least from Two of the Clock to Four. I beg your Pardon I send your Honour-this by a Porter: I assure your Honour, it was for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but because I would not have a Third Person privy to it; and that I might have the better opportunity to make good my Word to his Majesty, and to approve my self.</p>

The Letter was to Captain <hi>Tracy,</hi> that was his Land-lord, to speak to Coll. <hi>Rumsey,</hi> That he would be tender of him; and tell him, He had ground enough to serve the King upon other Men: and also to speak to Mrs. <hi>West,</hi> to desire, the same thing of her Husband.

                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> They have taken a great deal of pains, and made long Speeches, though very little of them relating to me, though too much. Coll. <hi>Rumsey</hi> tells your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of a Design they had to Assassinate the King, and carrying on a War, or something like it, when I was out of the Kingdom; That at Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi>'s House they drew up a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and that upon Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi>'s saying, things were not ready.

Charge the Guards while the King was Killing. <hi>My Lord,</hi> That was a very improbable thing: for I look upon it, that there is no difference between killing the King, and securing his Guards. These Gentlemen, by what they have said, do sufficiently convince the Court, and all that hear them, that they are sufficiently dipp'd themselves. Here they Combine to take away my Life, to save their own. Then they tell you, 'That Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rombald</hi> brought Notes about Men that were to Assassinate the King; but they do not tell your Lordship I was privy to any of these Notes; nor that I knew any of them. It's in it self very improbable, That I would ingage in so desperate an undertaking with Men I never saw, nor heard of in my life. Then he tells you, That Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> had been at a place where I was, &amp; there they inquired, what Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> had done: and withal, they told you, They met at my Lodging; now that their meeting was ar'my Lodging, was by Coll. <hi>Rumsey</hi>'s appointment, I knew nothing of it. Most of these Meetings were by Coll. <hi>Rumsey</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, or Mr. <hi>Wests:</hi> I accidentally came amongst them sometimes, but all my business was, only to hear News; nothing was agitated concerning Killing the King, or Levying of War, more or less, as I know of. I must confess, I did hear that there was a Design by a great many Lords, and Gentlemen, and others, for Asserting of their Liberties and Properties, but I was never in any Consultation with them, or any Message to them; nor I never saw one of these Lords, that I know of, that are said to be concerned. Therefore I say, 'tis very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable I should be so far concerned, as they seem to represent it; they met at the Five Bells, they allow themselves I was not at that meeting. For <hi>Mr. Keeling,</hi> he does not at all Charge me. What I said to <hi>Mr. West,</hi> relating to the business he talks of in <hi>October</hi> last, that, <hi>my Lord,</hi> is out of doors in point of time; I pray God forgive him for what he has said, I can't say more than I have.</p>

And then you talk of misprision of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: for a man to hear of Treason accidentally, or occasionally, and conceal it, is but mispri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: but if a man will be at a Consult where Treason is hatched, and will then conceal it, he is Guity of Treason therein; therefore do not mistake your Case. So that your Point of Law fails you, and every thing fails you in this Case. It appears plainly by them, That you were not only Privy to the Consult as an Auditor, but as an Actor; you chose your Post, and upon this point of Gallantry you would venture your self, not upon a Naked Man, but upon persons that would Oppose you.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>S. Gen.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>May it please your Lordship and you Gentlemen of the <hi>Iury,</hi> The Evidence you have heard has been very long, and I observe that Cap. <hi>Walcot</hi> has complained of it; it has been delivered mostly in general terms, and is afraid you should not apprehend it aright, to see those parts wherein he is concerned, but mistake what is said in general, to be spoken against him; I will therefore do him the justice as to recapitulate that part of the Evidence that does immediately concern himself. It has been very full, and given by every one of the four Witnesses that have been produced against him, besides the Letter under his own hand, which is twice as many more.</p>
                  <p>The first Witness I shall remind you of, is Mr. <hi>West,</hi> tho not produced first, yet because his Evidence goes further backward; his acquaintance began with him in last Summer Vacation, he became soon intimate with him, and Cap. <hi>Walcot</hi> did unbosom himself, and tell him that there was a design to make an Insurrection; that it was my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s design that he was to be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93094:13"/>
an Officer, I think he said a Colonel of Horse; he invited Mr. <hi>West</hi> to partake with him in that design, and did propose to him the advantage of a Command in the Army; but he not being qualified, declined it. He tells you further, that he did acquaint him, there was a design to Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinate the King; and 'tis easie enough to be believed; if there was one designed, the other was too. And you see all along the only dispute was, whether the Assassination should be first, or follow; for to raise Arms against the King, is directly to Assassinate the King; for it cannot end any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way with security to those that raised it. He told Mr. <hi>West</hi> he would not be concerned directly in the Assassination; but in the Insurection he would; he was perswaded to come in; this was last <hi>October</hi> discoursed with Mr. <hi>West,</hi> they were to rise in <hi>November.</hi> Then Col. <hi>Rumsey</hi> comes in, and he tells you that there was a design to rise in <hi>November.</hi> The Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> sent him to persons concerned in the Conspiracy to know in what readiness it was; but they being disappointed of men, whom they expected to rise in the Country, they did defer it at that time; at which my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> being concerned, went into <hi>Holland,</hi> and I think the Prisoner himself hath told you he went with him. The design was not then laid aside, but still carryed on, the most material man, Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> being in <hi>Holland,</hi> there was some little stop put to it, that is, to the swift progress of it; &amp; therefore he was s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt for over to manage it, as being the only man, in whom all persons had confidence. When he comes over, he brings Cap. <hi>Wal.</hi> along with him, Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> meets at Mr. <hi>Wests</hi> Chamber, this Mr. <hi>West</hi> and Col. <hi>Rumsey</hi> give an account of, they both swear it. Several meetings there was, in which Cap. <hi>Wal.</hi> was not, and possibly at those times he might be sick of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and that might occasion his not being there. But afterwards, both tell you that Cap. <hi>Walcot</hi> did meet at Mr. <hi>Wests</hi> Chamber, and there was debated parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Assassination of the King; and it was agreed to be at <hi>Rombalds</hi> house called the <hi>Rye,</hi> looking upon it as a very convenient place; as those that know it say; there being a narrow pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage that it was easie to assault, and hard for persons to esape, and with 40 or 50 men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; it was a design very likely to have suceeded. Cap. <hi>Walcots</hi> share in this, was not directly the Assassination of the King, that he would not be concerned in, being a Soldier, it was beneath him to do that; but his part was to fight the Guards, he looked upon that as the more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able employment; men-that were armed, to ingage them. This is proved both my Mr <hi>West</hi> and Col. <hi>Rumsey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place, Gentlemen, when this did not succeed, but was prevented by the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God Almighty, as you have heard, they carry on the design still, and take it into their Counsels, and resolved to carry it on, either at <hi>Windsor,</hi> or in his passage from <hi>Windsor</hi> to <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court; but no place was certainly fixed upon; and I think the latter resolution was, that it should be done at the <hi>Bull</hi> Feast, an entertainment that was designed here in the Fields. Now Gentlemen, while this was carrying on, it was necessary to carry on the other part too, that is the Insurrection; and that, Cap <hi>Walcot</hi> is all along concerned in. He is present at the meetings in the Taverns, where they discoursed concerning raising men to secure the King. This is Mr. <hi>Bournes</hi> Evidence, That at the <hi>Dragon-Tavern</hi> on <hi>Snow-Hill,</hi> there they met to consult to secure the King and the Duke. That he was present at the meeting in <hi>London,</hi> this is sworn by all, by Col. <hi>Rumsey,</hi> Mr. <hi>West,</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Bourne,</hi> where <hi>Goodenough</hi> was to give an account what success he had in the list, made of dividing the City in several parts, and raising men out of every division, and Cap. <hi>Walcot</hi> met for to know what progress they had made in it. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, every one of these are overt-Acts to declare his intention to kill the King, and are all High-Treason.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman at the Bar cannot attempt to mitigate his Offence, by saying he would not directly Assassinate the King, but would be the man to assist in raising Arms; this make him equally Guilty. To conspire to raise Arms against the King, certainly that is as great a Declaration of his Imagination of his heart to kill the King, as anything in the world. And this being proved upon him, there is no room for any Ojections for him to make; some he hath made, not worth the mention; but because they are those he thinks fit to put his life upon, I will take notice of them to you.</p>
                  <p>He says the Witnesses are not to be credited, because they have been concerned in the same Conspiracy.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, Because they have been concerned, therefore they are to be believed; for who should know this, but thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> that were so concerned? I think, Gentlem. there is no good man, no honest man would desire a better Evidence, for better Evidence could not have been had, unless the thing had taken success, and I am sure that is far from the heart of any man, that has the heart of a Christian, to wish. Does he pretend to intrap these Witnesses in any contradictions? Does he pretend to say that these Witnesses have consulted together to make up this story to accuse him for his life? There is nothing pretended of it, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he owns he met these men; but the end of his going there, was only to hear news. I thought that had not been the proper place to hear News inicertainly no man that comes there, would have been admitted me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rly for curiosity; certainly he must bring a mind to accompany them in all their Villany; but his own confession you have for that. I think he hath hardly confidence to deny, but he was at several Consults for raising of Arms at Mr. <hi>VVests</hi> Chamber. You were when <hi>Goodenough</hi> gave an account, at the <hi>Green-Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> Tavern. You were where discourses were of raising Arms to secure the King, and nothing he has said Gentlemen, to clear himself.</p>

That Letter (when he see his Name in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation) acknowledges it, it is his first Crime he says; what was that Crime? he was proclaimed as a Traitor: He says in his Letter, that his Life was at the King's Mercy, that if his Death would do the King more Service than his Life, God's Will be done; That if his M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Witnesses (who are certainly the Persons most capable of giving Evidence) tell you there were several times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and still they were by one Providence or another disappointed. All of them tell you, there was a Design to kill the King and Duke at the Rye in <hi>Hertfordshire,</hi> as they came from <hi>New-Market:</hi> This is very plain too,, That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Gentleman at the Bar knew of this; this he himself confesses, that the was at several of the Consults; and this he excuses it by, that that was bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Misprision of Treason, if he did not undertake to do any thing. As to that, Gentlemen, we do tell you; The Law is, That those that are at a Consult for the killing of the King, or doing of a Traiterous Act, that this is in them High Treason, this being at the consulting of it. 'Tis true, it would excu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> and mitigate the Fact, if they should come afterwards and discover it, it might intitle them to the King's Mercy; but to be at a Consult upon a treasonable Design, to meet for that purpose, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>r the Plot laid, and a Design to take the King's Life, or to raise Arms against him, and to say nothing of this, this is down-right Treason, and 'tis not Misprision of Treason; his Law that he relies upon fails him there. 'Tis very plain of his own Words, he heard of this Conspiracy, and he kept it secret, and says nothing of it; and this he says is his Crime that he mentioned to the King; so he would mitigate it by saying, 'tis but Misprision of Treason. But without doubt the meeting at several times upon this Design, if he had promised and undertaken nothing in it, his keeping of it private, as he has done, makes him guilty of High Treason: so that out of his own Words, 'tis plain that he is Guilty.</p>
                  <p>But then, consider what two Witnesses positively prove upon him: They prove, that he did there deny to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is done with Circumstances of overt-Acts too, as the providing of Horses, and a <hi>Tuck</hi> was to be prepared in order to it, and a <hi>Tuck</hi> he did prepare; whether he did go down, that is a little dark, but he did agree to go down.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, 'Tis plain by what Mr. <hi>West</hi> said of him, that he had a Design formerly in my L. <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s time to have raised War; he had undertaken to be a Collonel of Horse under my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and he offered Mr. <hi>West</hi> to be one of his Officers under him.

'Tis time to nip these Treasons when they are gone so far; certainly a more barbarous Design was never thought of by Mankind. We have had certainly as many Ingagements to the King, as any Subjects ever had to any Prince whatsoever; he has done as many Acts of Grace, we have lived as peaceably, as any People under a Prince can ever expect to do; he hath shewed himself with as much Kindness, with as much Lenity, even to his very Enemies, as any Prince that ever we read of; the Preservation of our Religion, and the Laws of the Kingdom, our Laws and Liberties, and all our Happiness depend as much upon his Life, as they ever did upon the Life of any Prince, or ever can do; so that we ought all to be concerned, even to the last drop of our Blood, to preserve Him: but how this mischievous Design should enter into the Hearts of Men, to undertake to kill him in such villanous and barbarous a manner as this, may justly makes us astonished.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, You hear your Evidence, you have a very strong Evidence in this Case, and stronger, I think, than could be expected in the Case of Treason.</p>

                  <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; the Part the Prisoner at the Bar was to act in this Treason, was the killing of the King; he was one of the Persons that were to be assisting in assassinating the King's Person. We will not trouble you with the large Evidence of the Rising, as we did Yesterday; but we will prove these things upon him, that he undertook to do it, that he was concerned with the rest of the Confederates: we shall shew you this is not a new thing, but he hath been an old Rebel; for this hath not been a new Project but hath been acting several Years. Five Years ago, when the King attended my Lord Mayor's Show, he undertook to kill him off of <hi>Bow</hi>-Church. We shall call our Witnesses, and prove it fully upon him.

                  <p>It was discoursed then of the King's coming home from <hi>New Market</hi> the <hi>Saturday</hi> after the Fire.

They said they hoped they would not come home on <hi>Monday.</hi> Says Mr. <hi>West</hi> to Mr. <hi>Rumbold</hi> then, How many Swan Quills, Goose Quills, and Crow Quills, and how much Sand and Ink must we have? I think the Prisoner at the Bar must needs remember it as well as I.

                  <p>By Swan Quills, they meant Blunderbusses; by Goose Quills, Muskets; and by Crow Quills, Pistols; and by Sand and Ink, Powder and Bullet. He took Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with me after that Meeting (for I never saw him, as I know of before) and

after some time he told me, he was one of them that was to go down to <hi>Rye</hi> to Assassinate the King. And since that, at a Coffee-house in <hi>Swithin</hi>'s Alley, he told me, It would never be well, till the Black-Bird and the Gold-Finch were knocked on the Head; they being Terms I did not understand, I asked him what he meant, he said the King and Duke of <hi>York.</hi>

But Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> did undertake to provide the Men, and Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough</hi> said, he would try him, if he would make an attempt upon the Duke without the King.

Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> said, he had spoke to him fully about the thing. And I saw him often in the Company of <hi>Mannius,</hi> that was designed to be another of the Assassinates. He was at my Chamber once; says he, Master shall we do nothing? I think he used these Words, That if the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would be true, and appear, he could bring 50 or threescore honest Men of to'ther side the Water to do the business: I asked him, what Business? says he, either a brisk Push (that I took for an Insurrection) for the two Brothers: says I, what Brothers do you mean?

                  <p>My Lord, I know the Prisoner at the Bar very well, I have known him many years, I have always known him guilty of Plotting and Contriving, and ready upon all occasions to embrace any thing for these Purposes laid to his Charge. Particularly, when Sir <hi>Francis Chaplain</hi> was Lord Mayor, his Majesty and the Duke stood at Mr. <hi>Waldoe</hi>'s House, by reason of the Angel-House being shaken. And he came to my House, and told me, he would discourse me upon some private Matter, I called him into a Closet, and he told me, they had a fair opportunity to take off the King and the Duke at once; I told him, that would do very well, but how will you do it? Says he, we will do it with Cross-Bows, we are to be half a Dozen, and we will go into the Steeple, where there is a Window just opposite to the Balcony, and a great deal of Discourse we had to this purpos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. My intent was to divert him from this Design, and told him how impossible it was they should escape the Foot-Guards, and Horse Guards, and multitude of People: And if he did not do the Business effectually, he would be undone, and all the Party. I rested satisfied he would have desisted upon this. But I knew the Principles of these Fifth Monarchy Men, and their Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, and thought it not safe to trust to his bare say so, that he would desist, but I went to the King and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> into my Lord Chamberlains Chamber, where they came to me, and I gave them this Account, and desired them to set some to watch the place, and to search if any were got into the Steeple before they came; and there was one <hi>Horsal</hi> appointed, that did accordingly watch them, but none came: Upon which some good-willers
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93094:16"/>
to it have reported that it was a Sham-Business, but I think that was not well done. But the thing was real, and when he was examined before the King in the Secretary's Office, he did confess all these things that I charged him with.</p>

                  <p>But regard none.

                  <p>Do not say so, the King does not deal hardly with you, but I am afraid it will appear you would have dealt more hardly with the King: You would not have given the King an hours notice for saving his Life.</p>

                  <p>I had no Pannel, I will assure you, delivered me; I had some Names of People that they said were usually on Juries.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. Just.</speaker>
                  <p>They were the Names of the Jury.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Russel.</speaker>
                  <p>They were only the Names of them that were like to be of the Jury, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pannel came to me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, there can be no other Copy given, but the same that was delivered; for your Lordship does know in this case, any Person accused, as your Lordship is, may challenge 35; and therefore there is a Return generally of 3 score, or 4 score, and these are returned in case of your Lordships challenge. When you have challenged so many as you please, then the 12 men that stand after your challenge are to be of the Jury: And therefore this is not like a Pannel made up by the Sheriff, in ordinary Causes between Man and Man; there they make a formal Pannel, from which they cannot depart, when that is once returned; but herein Criminal Cases, because of the Challenge, they return either 60 or 80: And I presume your Lordship was attended with the Names delivered.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I did not mind it, I put it away.

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. Just.</speaker>
                  <p>There is no Pannel made in <hi>London</hi> by Freeholders, we have very few Freeholders capable of being impannel'd, because the Estates of the City belong much to the Nobility and Gentlemen that live abroad, and to Corporations: therefore in the City of <hi>London</hi> the Challenge of Freeholders is excepted.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Russel.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I thought it had been always so, and the Law had been clear in that Case throughout <hi>England,</hi> that no man ought to be tryed for his life, but by those that have Freeholds. My Lord, I remember I read the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. where 'tis positive, that no Persons shall be Judged in cases of life and death but by those that have 40 <hi>s.</hi> a year.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. Just.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, that Statute extends not to this Case. Read the Statute.</p>

                  <p>There is nothing mentioned in that Statute with relation to the City of <hi>London</hi> indeed, but the necessity of the thing requires it.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Pollexfen.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, Perhaps if we had more consideration of it we should speak more, but if your Lordship pleases to hear us what we can say; first, we take it, with submission, at Common Law a Freehold was necessary to make a man Juryman. But that which falls out in this case is the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3. which Statute I suppose is here in Court, That Statute says this (if you please I will quote the substance of it) That none shall be admitted to pass upon any Inquest upon the Tryal of the death of a man, except he have Lands and Tenements of the yearly value of 40 <hi>s.</hi> Now we are here I think within the words of the Statute, and I take it to be no Question at all were we not in a City and County. I think this would be no question upon any Tryal in any County at large. The Statute does not make any exception or distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between Cities and Counties at large, but the words are general, as I have opened them. My Lord, the Statute does also provide in cases of Freehold or 40 Marks. Now, my Lord, to prove this Statute extends to <hi>London,</hi> tho a City and County, there are other Statutes that have been made subsequent make it plain that it does
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93094:18"/>
so extend. But before I speak to them, There is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Inst. fo.</hi> 157. that takes notice of this Statute, and speaks it generally that the Freehold ought to be in the same County, nor do I remember to have seen any Book that distinguishes between Counties at large and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Counties. But Statutes that have been made concerning Cities and Counties are a plain declaration that this is meant of Juries both in Cities and Counties. I will mention the Statute 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 5. The substance of the Statute is this, It takes notice that there were Challenges in <hi>London</hi> for that they had not 40 <hi>s. per Ann.</hi> and that this Challenge was to be made in the Wards, which are the same with Hundreds in the Counties, so this Statute is made to take away the Challenge of 40 <hi>s.</hi> Freehold. This Statute of 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. that takes away the Challenge in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for not having 40 <hi>s.</hi> is, with submission, a strong Evidence and Authority that it was before that time a good Challenge, for otherwise to what end should they make a Statute to take away the Challenge, unless it were before a good cause of Challenge. In the next place 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 3. that extends to Civil Causes in <hi>London,</hi> and says, That in <hi>London</hi> Jurors shall (but provides only for <hi>London</hi> in Civil Causes) be admitted in Civil Causes, that have goods to the value of 100 Marks. My Lord, if that first Statute, or the Common Law, had not extended to require Freeholds in <hi>London,</hi> then there would have been no need of this Statute that was made to inable men to be Jurors that had goods to the value of 100 Marks. So that we take it to be good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that by the Common Law Freehold was required in all Civil Causes. Then there is another Statute 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13. and that will be a strong evidence to shew what the Law is, For the Statute says, in Cities and Burroughs, in Tryals of Murder and Felony, if a Freeman of the City of <hi>London</hi> is to be tried, the Freemen shall be upon the Jury, tho' they have not Freehold, and then there is a <hi>Proviso,</hi> that for Knights and Esquires that are out of the Burrough, tho' they are arraigned in the Burrough, that extends not to them, tho' in cases of Murder and Felony. As for this Statute, we take this sense of it, First that it does not extend to Treasons, for when it only names Murders, and Felonies, that makes no alteration as to Treason, therefore that stands as before: But if there be any alteration, that extends only to Freemen and Burgesses that are to be tried, but not to Knights and Esquires, so that if we were in a case of Felony and Murder, I think we are not concerned in this Statute, for we are no Freeman nor Burgesse, but we are an Esquire, and therefore ought to be tryed by Freeholders: So that for the Law we relye upon these Statutes, that we have looked upon as strong evidence, that there ought to be in the Tryal of the life of a man, especially for Treason, Freeholders. First, if it were in Civil Causes, if this qualification be not in Jury-men then an Attaint would lye; the Penalty in an Attaint is, that their Houses should be pulled down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is provided by the Law, to the intent the Jury may be careful to go according to their evidence. 'Tis true, no Attaint does lie in in Criminal Causes, but if so be in Civil Causes there be required Freeholders, and an Attaint lies if there be not, 'tis not reasonable to think but there should be as great regard to the life of a man, as to his Estate. Next, my Lord, I do not know any Law that sets any kind of qualification but this of Freehold, so that be the Persons of what condition or nature soever (supposing they be not outlawed) yet these Persons, if this Law be not in effect, may then serve, and be put upon the life of a man. These are the reasons, my Lord, for which we apprehend they ought to be Freeholders.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I would desire one word of the same side: We insist in this case upon these two things; First, we conceive by the Common Law, every Jury-man ought to have a Free-hold, we have good Authority for it, <hi>Cokes first Institutes,</hi> but if that were not so, I think the Statute Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> hath first mentioned, 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3. to be express in this point. My Lord, the Statute in the Preamble does recite all the mischiefs, it says great mischiefs, ensued by <hi>Iuries</hi> that were made up of Persons that had not Estates sufficient; in what? As well in the case of the Death of a Man, as in the case of Free-hold between Party and Party: The Statute reciting this mischief, does in express words, provide two Remedies for the same in these Cases: First on the Life or Death of a man, the Jury or Inquest, to be taken, shall have 40 <hi>s. per Ann.</hi> and so between Party and Party 40 Marks, so that this being the Tryal of the Death of a Man, it is interpreted by <hi>Stamford</hi> 162 <hi>a.</hi> That is in all Cases where a Man is Arraigned for his Life, that is within the express words of the Statute. Besides this Exposition that hath been put upon the Statute, my Lord, it does seem that the Judgment of several Parliaments hath been accordingly in severall Times and Ages. My Lord, to instance in one Statute that hath not been mentioned, and that is the 33 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 23. That does give the King Power to award Commissions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> for Tryals in any County of <hi>England.</hi> And that (says the Statute) in such
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93094:19"/>
Cases no Challenge to the Shire or Hundred shall be allowed; that is, you shall not Challenge the Jury in such a Case, because they have not Free-hold, are not of the County where the Treason was Committed; but that upon the Tryal Challenge for lack of Free-hold of 40 <hi>s.</hi> a year shall be allowed, though it alters the manner of Trying Treason by the Common Law; so that, my Lord, here is the Opinion of that very Parliament; that though it took away the usual method of Tryals, yet it saves the Prisoners Challenge for want of Free-hold. Now indeed that Statute is repealed; but I mention it as to the <hi>Proviso</hi> that it shews the Judgment of that Parliament at that time: My Lord, those other Statutes that have been made to Regulate Cities and Towns Corporate, why were they made? 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. That no Free-hold should be allowed, that shews that 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. did extend to these Cases. But my Lord, these Statutes that shew the Judgment of the Parliament, sufficient to our purpose, do not extend to this Case; the Statute goes only to Murders and Felonies, but not to Treasons: And we are in the case of a Penal Statute, and concerning the Life and Death of a Man, which ought to be taken strictly, it ousts the Prisoner of a Benefit; and by parity of Reason, if Treason be not mentioned, your Lordship can't by Equity extend it to it, when it only menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inferiour Offences, and takes away the benefit in lower Cases: Like the Case of the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> where the Statute set down D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>an and Chapters, and other Ecclesiastical Persons, it shall not extend to Bishops, because it begins with Persons of an inferiour Nature: No more shall Murder and Felony extend to Treason. But further the Statute only concerns Freemen, for there is an express Proviso in the Case: for in case any Knight, or Esquire come to be Tryed in the Place, he has his Benefit as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. My Lord, we are in this Case, as in the Case not mentioned in the Statute, we are not a Freeman of <hi>London.</hi> My Lord, there is another thing 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 5. Why there was not only requisite at the Common-Law, that the Jurors had sufficient Free-hold, but it was required it should be in the Hundred; and Free-hold in the Wards in the City is the same with Free-hold in the Hundreds in the Country: So that the want of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in the Hundred, was a good cause of Challenge. So that I think it will hardly be denied, but that a Jury that passes upon the life of a Man, ought by the Law, by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and by the Judgment of the Parliament, to have Free-hold. Where is there then any Statute whatsoever that makes a difference in this Case, between <hi>London</hi> and other Counties? We are in the case of Treason, we have taken our Exceptions, and on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Prisoner at the Bar we pray the Challenge may be allowed.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Ward.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I shall be short, because Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> has observed these things so particularly already. I observe the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. is a general Statute, and extends throughout the Realm: Now when the thing is thus general, there is no room to except particulars. And in this case 'tis within the very words of the Law, if the words be so generally penned in the negative, then we conceive there is no constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be made upon them, unless some subsequent Parliament alter it. <hi>Coke's Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi> 157. where 'tis said in Treason as well as any thing else, upon <hi>H.</hi> 5. there shall be Freeholds. If they have provided in Civil and other Criminal Causes, it were strange that this should be <hi>Casus omissus,</hi> but there is no construction against a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law. For the Parliament taking care of the City of <hi>London</hi> (as the subsequent Statutes say) that he that hath 100 Marks shall pass in Civil Causes, and then it says in Murders and Felonies, and that only confined to the Freemen of the place, does sufficiently explain the Law, where 'tis not altered by any subsequent Act, therefore I desire the Challenge may be admitted.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, these Gentlemens Foundation is not good, for they prove it not by any Books, that at Common-Law it was requisite for a Juryman to have Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. My Lord, I deny their Foundation, there is no such Law, and at this day in all Criminal Cases where the Statute does not direct it, as for Riots and other Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Misdemeanour, there is no Law restrains them, and they may be tryed by any men they have no exception against. Then 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. says, None shall be admitted to pass upon the death of a Man, (I take it to extend to all Capital matters, though it is pretty odly expressed; for when a Man is accused of other Felonies and High Treasons, 'tis of the death of a man) unless he have Lands or Tenements, of the yearly value of 40<hi>s.</hi> But I will take it as these Gentlemen do at this Time, it not being so at Common-Law, nor in other Criminal Cases, but what are provided for by the Statute: As to other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Felony and Murder, no doubt there these Challenges are to be taken upon the Statute, but not for Treason, because the Statute of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> does expresly repeal
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93094:19"/>
that Statute; and no Statute since takes away the force of that of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; that all Tryals for Treason shall be as at the Common-Law; and according to this the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant practice in all Cities (not only <hi>London</hi>) where Persons have been Indicted for High Treason hath been. There was never any such thing pretended: Most of these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have Freeholds, but we would not have this point lost to the City of <hi>London</hi>; so that the Statute they speak of, and the Interpretations of the several other Statutes too, are to no purpose; for we say by Common-Law all Causes might be Tryed by any Persons, against whom there was not sufficient Cause of Challenge; and the Common-Law is by that Statute restored in this point.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I have little to say; Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> hath given a true Answer to it, the Foundation does fail them. It was not necessary at Common-Law, for a Jury-man to have Freehold: but then they must shew you, my Lord, it is altered, and made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. The Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. does not seem to extend to Treason, but if it did, 'tis now out of doors, by that of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> whereby all Tryals of Treason are reduced to the Common-Law. This is that we answer, they fail in their Foundation, they do not make it out, that it was necessary for a Jury-man at Common-Law to have Freehold.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Geo. Jeff.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I confess they have cited several Acts of Parliament, and upon them lay their Foundation, and draw Inferences from them: But they will find, that in several Acts of Parliament which they have quoted, there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular regard had for the preservation of the constant Usage and Custom for Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als within the City of <hi>London.</hi> That notwithstanding several Acts of Parliament have in other places ascertained the value of Jurors; yet they had still an Eye that the City of <hi>London</hi> should continue in its Usages. I think it will be necessary to put you in mind of the Case of the City of <hi>Worcester.</hi> It would be very hard, say they, because an Attaint does not lye in Criminal matters; if you intend by that to have People of Ability, 'tis well known, that the ablest People in the City of <hi>London,</hi> have scarce any Freehold in it; for that most of the Inheritances of the City of <hi>London</hi> remain in the Nobility and in Corporations. Now in the Case of my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> he hath a peremptory Challenge to 35, and I think I may adventure to say, there can scarce be 35 more that can call themselves Freeholders in <hi>London</hi>; consider the Consequence then, Treason should be committed in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and there would not be enow in the City of <hi>London</hi> to try it. In the Case of the <hi>Quo-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> brought against the City of <hi>Worcester,</hi> to know by what Warrant several took upon them the Offices of Aldermen; the Gentlemen at the Bar objected that it was reasonable that no Freehold should be determined, but by Freeholders. But the Judges of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> (the Court being full) for the necessity of the thing, lest there might not be sufficient Freeholders in the City, having sent one of the Judges of that Court to your Lorships of the Common-Pleas, for that Reason did agree the Challenge was not good. I know these Gentlemen will please to remember the Case; so that I say, as in one Case we ought to be tender of the Life of the Prisoner, so we ought surely to be tender of the Life of the King, otherwise it may so happen, that the Kings Life may be incompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and Treason commited in the City, and there would be no way in the World to Try it; therefore we pray for the King the Challenge may be over-ruled.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>M. North.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, it is the practice to make the <hi>Venire facias,</hi> without mentioning Freehold, for it does not Command, that they return so many men that have Freehold, but <hi>probos &amp; legales homines de visineto</hi>; therefore at the Common-Law, those were good Inquests to Try any man that were not Excommunicated, nor under any Out-Law. 'Tis true, there are Statutes that say, all Jury-men shall have Freehold; but we say these Statutes do not extend to the City of <hi>London,</hi> but that it is governed by its own Customs; and we say it is the Custom that Citizens of Ability have been returned, that have no Freehold. But granting what we do not, but by way of supposal, my Lord, it does not extend to this Case, because Tryals are to be according to the use at Common-Law, by the Statute of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which does set them at large again; and that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Prisoner, in this Case, hath his Challenge for 35, and is in other Cases re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to 20; so that we say, these men of Ability are good, and there is no Statute affects them.</p>

                  <p>Unless you speak of Treason, you do not speak <hi>ad Idem.</hi> For I do take it that in Cases of Treason, or in Cases of Felony, at the Common Law, they had no liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93094:20"/>
to except to Jurors, that they had not any Freehold, but that at the Common Law any good and Lawful men might pass. Then take as introductive of a new Law the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. I am of the mind that this Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. peradventure may extend to Treasons and Felonies; but when the Statute of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> comes and says, all Tryals shall be by such Evidence, and in such manner, as by common Law they ought to have been, I do not see how it is possible to make an Objection afterwards of this Nature. For, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this Act of Parliament of <hi>H.</hi> 5. had altered the Common Law, and given a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, why then when the Statute of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> comes and sets all Tryals at large in the Case of Treasons, then certainly the Challenge is gone again, and I doubt you will not find one Exception in this case, ever since that Statute concerning the Jurys Freehold in Cases of Treason, but it hath generally passed otherwise, and there hath not been any ever excepted; I doubt it will be a very hard thing to maintain such a Challenge now. Here are my Lords and Brothers will be pleased to deliver their Opinions. It is a business of great consequence, not only for this Noble Person at the Bar, but for all other Persons.</p>

                  <p>I agree with your Lordship perfectly, but if the Counsel had laid a right Foundation that it had been so at Common Law, there had been much said; But I take it at Common Law there was no Challenge for want of Freehold, and I am induced to think so, for otherwise what needed the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. been made? But whether it extend to Treason or no, I am not so clear. And if it did, it's wiped off again by that of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which reduces all to the Common Law Tryal.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Just. Wyndham.</speaker>
                  <p>I am of the same Opinion: I conceive at Common Law, lack of Free-hold no good cause of Challenge. 'Tis true, that Challenge is given in some cases by Act of Parliament, yet I doubt whether it extend to a thing of so high nature as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for other Statutes have not mentioned any thing of Treason. But suppose 2. <hi>H.</hi> 5. did extend to it, yet it is very plain, the Statute of 1. and 2. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> hath set all at large again. They are to be good and Lawful Men, and I do not find that any thing of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness must be the Freehold. And therefore, I conceive this is no just Exception in this case.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I am of the same Opinion. I am of Opinion that the Common Law did not require Freehold to be a good cause of Challenge, in the case of Treason, and the rather, Because at the Common Law a man that was indicted of High Treason, had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Challenge, peremptorily, to the Number of 35. Persons. My Lord, if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law be altered by the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. yet I take it, that the Statute of 1. and 2. <hi>Ph.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> does restore the Common Law in this particular point. For whereas there was a Statue of <hi>H.</hi> 8. to restrain the Prisoner to the Number of 20, for his Challenge, now the Statute restoring it to Common Law, the Prisoner hath his Challenge to 35, as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 8. So I take it, the King shall have his priviledge also to try a Prisoner for Treason, by Persons that have not Freehold.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Just. Charlton.</speaker>
                  <p>I am of the same Opinion. And truly the rather, because no President hath been offered of any such Challenge before, and many men have suffered, and sure if it could have been, many would have made use of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Just. Levins.</speaker>
                  <p>I am of Opinion 'tis not to be allowed. I do not think my self driven to the necessity to determine now whether Freehold was a good Challenge at Common Law in point of Treason. I think the Statute of <hi>Ph.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> hath restored the Tryals to the Common Law. What was the Common Law? The Common Law is the Custom of <hi>England,</hi> which is other in Cities than in Countries, and the Custom of <hi>London</hi> is part of that Common Law. So, tho it be a cause of Challenge in a County at large, yet it is not a cause of Challenge in Cities, where Freeholders are not to be found. Now that which satifies me is, That this Custom is restored by the Statute of <hi>Ph.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> Because never such a Challenge hath been. And it is known when 20 were tryed for Treason together in this very place, and one of them a notable cunning Lawyer, and if such a Challenge were to have been allowed, no doubt he would have made use of it, but the Challenge was not taken, and if he had made such a Challenge, and it had been allowed, perhaps he could not have been tried: That was <hi>Cook.</hi> I have heard several Persons tryed for Treason my self, and never heard it taken. Therefore I am of Opinion, that before any Statute was made in this case, It was the Custom in <hi>London</hi> to try without Freeholds, and since by the Statute of Queen Mary 'tis restored.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Baron Streete.</speaker>
                  <p>I think there was no such Challenge at Common Law. The Jury were only to be <hi>Probos &amp; Legales homines,</hi> and no more, till the Statute made it so, but there is a particular Reservation for Corporations. And certainly, if this should be admitted to be a good Challenge, tho' it were between Party and Party,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93094:20"/>
there would be in some Corporations a perfect failure of Justice. So that without doubt at Common Law there was no such Challenge. As for the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 5. 'tis gone by that of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> If this were admitted within <hi>London,</hi> nothing would be more mischievous to this Corporation. Methinks we have been very nice in this matter, when the life of the King is at Stake, and all the Customs and Priviledges of the City of <hi>London</hi> seem to be levelled at in this point. I am of the Opinion with the rest of the Judges, that this Challenge ought to be over-ruled.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, the Court is of Opinion, upon hearing your Counsel, and the Kings, that it is no good Challenge to a Jury in a case of Treason, that he has not Freehold within the City. But I must tell your Lordship withall, That your Lordship has nothing of hardship in this case, for notwithstanding that, I must tell you, you will have as good a Jury, and better than you should have had in a Country of 4 <hi>l.</hi> or 40 <hi>s.</hi> a year Freeholders. The Reason of the Law for Freeholds is, That no slight Persons should be put upon a Jury, where the Life of a man or his Estate comes in Question, but in the City the Persons that are impannell'd are men of Quality and Substance, men that have a great deal to lose, And therefore your Lordship hath the same in substance, as if a Challenge was allowed of Freehold. It will be no kind of prejudice to your Lordship in this case, Therefore, if you please, apply your self as the Jury is called, and make your Exceptions, if you shall make any.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, most of our Evidence against this Honourable Person at the Bar is to this purpose, This Person, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> they were the Council of State, as I may call them, to give forth directions for the general Rising that hath appeared was to have been within this Kingdom. The Rising was of great concern and expence, and must be managed by Persons of interest, prudence, and great secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e. These Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had frequent meeting in <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November</hi> last (for then, you may refresh your memories again, was the general Rising to be) and there they did consult how to manage the Rising, they consulted how to seize the King's Guards; And this Noble person being mixed with these others, especially with <hi>Ferguson,</hi> who with others of an inferior rank was also ingaged in a Cabal for managing worser things (tho' this is bad enough); at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93094:21"/>
meetings they receive Messages from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> touching the Rising. They being looked upon as the Persons that were to conclude and settle the time and all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances about it.</p>
                  <p>We shall make it appear to you in the course of our Evidence, that those Underlings (for this was the great Consult, and moved all the other Wheels) who managed the Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sination, did take notice that these Lords and Gentlemen of Quality were to manage and steer the whole business of the Rising. It seems these Gentlemen could not give the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> satisfaction to his mind, for he pressed them to keep their day, which was the 17th of <hi>November</hi> last, But the honourable Person at the Bar, and the rest, made him this Answer, That Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had failed them, for that he had promised to have 1000 Foot and 2 or 300 Horse at four hours warning, but now it was come to pass, he could not Perform it, that some Persons in the West would not joyn with them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at this time they could not proceed, and therefore they must defer the day. And as a Council, they sent my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> word he must be contented, they had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise resolved, and thereupon my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> went away, and Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p>To carry on this practice they took others into their Council Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> was left out, and there falling that Scandalous Report upon my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> he was to be left out, and then there was to be a new Council of Six, whereas the inferior Council to manage the Assassination was seven. At this Council there was this honourable Person at the Bar, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and another honourable Person, who I am sorry to name upon this account, who hath this morning prevented the hand of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice upon himself, my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>: These six had their frequent Consults at this Honourable Persons House; for they had Excluded Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> for these Gentlemen would have the Face of Religion; and my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> was in their esteem so scandalous, that they thought that would not prevail with the people, if he was of the Council. There they debated how they should make this Rising, after several Consultations they came to this Resolution, That before they did fall upon this Rising, they should have an exact accompt both of the time and method of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Rising; and thereupon a Messenger was sent on purpose by Collonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> viz. <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> to invite <hi>Scotch</hi> Commissioners to treat with these Noble Lords. Pursuant to this, j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <hi>Scotland</hi>; then they fell to 10000, and at last (for the <hi>Scots</hi> love Money) they fell to 5000, which they would take and run all hazards, but they not coming to their Terms, that broke off that Week the Plot was discovered.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, if we prove all these Instances, besides we shall call some to shew you that all the inferior Party still looked upon these to be the Heads; and tho' they kept it secret, God hath suffered it to come to light with as plain an Evidence as ever was heard.</p>

                  <p>I am not certain whether I did hear something about a Declaration there, or that Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> did Report it to my L. <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> that they had debated it.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Ch. Just.</speaker>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>All the Company did debate it. Afterwards they thought it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to see with what care and vigilance they did Guard themselves at the <hi>Savoy</hi> and the <hi>Mews,</hi> whether they might be surprized or not.</p>

                  <p>I went to them from my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury:</hi> And I did tell them, That my Lord did pray they would come to some Resolution; &amp; they told me, Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> they depended upon, for <hi>Taunton,</hi> had failed them, who when he came up to Town, first at the Term, had assured them, that in three or four Hours time, he could have <hi>One Thousand</hi> Foot, and <hi>Three Hundred</hi> Horse: But now it came to be tryed, he An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered it was not possible for him to undertake it, for People would not rush into it of a sudden, but have some time to prepare for their Families.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> have very few Questions to ask him, for <hi>I</hi> know little of the matter, for it was the greatest accident in the World <hi>I</hi> was there, and when <hi>I</hi> saw that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was there, <hi>I</hi> would have been gone again. I came there accidentally to speak with Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi>; <hi>I</hi> was just come to Town, but there was no discourse of Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the Guards, nor no undertaking of Raising an Army.</p>

                  <p>In the month of <hi>October</hi> last, as I remember, Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> came to me in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth's</hi> name, and desired the conveniency of my house for him and some other Persons of Quality to meet there. And as soon as I had granted it, in the evening the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Sr. <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> Col. <hi>Romsey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> came. Sr. <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> desired me, that none of my Servants might come up, but they might be private; so what they wanted I went down for, a Bottle of wine or so. The substance of their discourse was, how to surprize the Kings Guards. And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Tho. Armstrong,</hi> as I remember, went one night to the <hi>Mews,</hi> or thereabout, to see the Kings Guards. And the next time they came to my house, I heard Sir <hi>Tho. Armstrong</hi> say, the Guards were very remiss in their places, and not like Souldiers, and the thing was feasible, if they had strength to do it.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir <hi>Geo. Jeff.</hi>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Sheppard.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>It was somewhat in the nature of a Declaration; it was read by Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> who was present at the reading, I cannot say whether they were All present or not. The purport of it was setting forth the Greivances of the Nation, but truly what Particulars I can't tell: It was a pritty large Paper.</p>

                  <p>The design of that Paper, was in the nature of a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, setting forth the Greivances of the Nation, in order to a Riseing, I suppose by the

                  <p>Swear my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> (which was done.) Pray will your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship give an account to the Court, what you know of a Rising designed before my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> went away, and afterwards how it was continued on.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I appear with some confusion. Let no man wonder that it is troublesome to me. My Lord, as to the Question Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> puts to me, this is the Accompt I have to give. 'Tis very well known to every one, how great a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made in the City, upon occasion of the long dispute about the Election of Sheriffs: And this soon produced a greater freedom and liberty of Speech one with another, than perhaps had been used formerly, tho'not without some previous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations and dispositions made to the same thing. Upon this occasion among others, I was acquainted with Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> a person that had been some Months in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being returned out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and who indeed I had not seen for 11 Years before. But he came to me assoon as he came out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and when these unhappy divisions came, he made very frequent applications to me; and tho' he was unknown himself, yet being brought by me he soon gained a confidence with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and from him derived it to others, when this unhappy rent and division of mind was, he having before got himself acquainted with many Persons of the City, had entred into such Counsels with them, as afterwards had the Effect, which in the ensuing Narrative I shall relate to your Lordship. He came to me, and told me that they were now sensible all they had was going, that this Force put upon them—</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>There is an unhappy accident happened that hath sunk my voice, I was but just now acquainted with the fate of my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi>—My Lord I say, He came to me, and did acquaint me that the People were now so sensible, that all their Interest was going by that violence offered to the City in their Elections, that they were resolved to take some course to put a stop to it, if it were possible: He told me there were several Consults and Meetings of Persons about it, and several Persons had begun to put themselves into a disposition, and preparation to Act; That some had furnished themselves with very good Horses, and kept them in the most secret and blind Stables they could; That divers had intended it, and for his own part he was resolved to imbark himself in it. And having an Estate in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he thought to dispatch his Son thither; (for he had a good real Estate, and a great Stock, how he disposed of his Real estate I know not); But he ordered his Son to turn his Stock into mony to furnish him for the occasion: This I take to be about <hi>August.</hi> His Son was sent away. Soon after this, the Son not being yet returned, and I hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing several accompts from him, wherein I found the Fermentation grew higher and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93094:23"/>
higher, and every day a nearer approach to Action. I told him I had a necessity to go into <hi>Essex</hi> to attend the concernes of my own Estate, but told him, how he might by another name convey Letters to me, and gave him a little Cant, by which he might blind and disguise the Matter he wrote about, when I was in the Country. I receiv'd two or three Letters from him, that gave me an Account in that disguised stile, but such as I understood, that the Negotiation which he had with my Correspondents was going on, and in good Condition; and it was earnestly desired, I would come to Town; this was the middle of <hi>September.</hi> I notwithstanding was willing to see the result of that great Affair, upon which all Mens Eyes were fixed, which was the Determination of the Sherivalty about that time. So I ordered it to fall into Town, and went to my own House on <hi>Saturday</hi> night, which was <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day. On <hi>Sunday</hi> he came to me, and Dined with me, and told me (after a general Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given me of the Affairs of the times) that my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was, secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and withdrawn from his own House in <hi>Aldersgate</hi>-Street; and that though he had a Family setled, and had absconded himself from them, and divers others of his Friends and Confidents; yet he did desire to speak with me, and for that purpose sent him to shew me the way to his Lodging: He brought me to a House at the lower end of <hi>Wood-street,</hi> one <hi>Watson</hi>'s House, and there my Lord was alone. He told me he could not but be sensible, how Innocent soever he was, both he and all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Men were unsafe, so long as the Administration of Justice was in such Hands, as would accomodate all things to the Humor of the Court. That in the Sense of this he thought it but reasonable to provide for his own Safety, by withdrawing himself from his own House into that Retirement. That now he had ripen'd Affairs to that head, and had things in that Preparation, that he did not doubt but he should be able, by those Men that would be in readiness in <hi>London,</hi> to turn the Tide, and put a stop to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that was ready to overflow. But he did complain to me, that his design, and the design of the Publick was very much obstructed, by the unhandsome Deportment of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> who had withdrawn themselves, not only from his Assistance, but from their own Ingagements and Appointments. For when he had got such a formed Force as he had in <hi>London,</hi> and expected to have it answered by them in the Country, they did recede from it, and told him they were not in a Condition, or Preparation in the Country, to be concurrent with him at that time. This he looked upon but as an artificial Excuse, and as an instance of their Intentions, wholly to desert him; but notwithstanding there was such Preparation made in <hi>London,</hi> that if they were willing to lose the Honour of being concurrent with him, he was able to do it himself, and did intend spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to put it into Execution. I asked him, what Forces he had, he said he had enough; sayes I, what are you assured of? Sayes he, there is above <hi>Ten Thousand</hi> brisk Boys are ready to follow me, when ever I hold up my Finger: Sayes I, how have you methoded this, that they shall not be crushed, for there will be a great Force to oppose you? Yes, he answered, but they would possess themselves of the Gates; and these <hi>Ten Thousand</hi> Men in twenty four Hours, would be multiplied into five times the Number, and be able to make a Sally out, and possess themselves of <hi>White-Hall,</hi> by beating the Guards. I told him, this was a fair Story, and I had reason to think, a Man of his figure would not undertake a thing that might prove so fatal, unless it were laid on a Foundation that might give a prudent Man ground to hope it would be Success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. He said he was certain of it, but confessed it was a great disappointment, that these Lords had failed him: I told him, I was not provided with an Answer at that time, That he well knew me, and knew the general frame, and bent of my Spirit. But I told him, I looked upon it as dangerous, and ought to be laid deep, and to be very well weighed and considered of; and did not think it a thing fit to be entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without the Concurrence of those Lords: And therefore desired, before I disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my own Inclination, to discourse with those Lords. He did consents with much ado; but sayes he, you will find they will wave it, and give doubtful and deferring Answers, but you will find this a Truth. I went to <hi>Moor-Parke</hi> the next day, where the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was, and told him the great Complaint my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> had made, that he failed him: Sayes he, I think he is mad, I was so far from giving him any incouragement, that I did tell him from the beginning, and so did my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> there was nothing to be done by us in the Country at that time. I did not then own I had seen my Lord, but spake as if this were brought me by a third Person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had not given me Liberty to tell them where his Lodging was. Sayes I, My Lord, I shall be able to give a better account of this in a day or two; Shall I convey
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93094:24"/>
it to my Lord, that you are willing to give a Meeting? Yes, sayes he, with all my Heart: This was the <hi>Second, Third,</hi> or <hi>Fourth</hi> of <hi>Octobre</hi>; I came to Town on <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and was carried to him on <hi>Monday</hi>; and I suppose this was <hi>Tuesday</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> of <hi>October</hi>; On <hi>Wednesday</hi> I think I went to him again (but 'tis not very material) and told him I had been with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and given him a punctual Account of what I had from him; and the Duke did absolutely disown any such thing; and told me, he never did give him any incouragement to proceed that way, because the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were not in a disposition for Action, nor could be put in readiness at that time; Sayes my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> 'Tis false, they are afraid to own it. And sayes he, I have reason to believe, there is some artificial Bargain between his Father and him, to Save one another: For when I have brought him to Action, I could never get him to put on, and therefore I suspect him: And sayes he, several honest Men in the City have puzled me, in asking how the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> lived: Sayes he, they puzled me, and I could not answer the Question; for I know he must have his Living from the King; and sayes he, We have different Prospects; We are for a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> and he hath no other Design but his own personal Interest, and that will not go down with My People now (so he called them) they are all for a <hi>Common-Wealth:</hi> And then sayes he, 'Tis to no purpose for me to see him; it will but widen the Breach, and I dare not trust him to come hither. Sayes I, My Lord, That's a good one indeed, Dare not you trust him, and yet do you send me to him on this Errand? Nay, sayes he, 'Tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have had some Mis-understanding of late; but I believe he is true enough to the Interest. Sayes I, 'Tis a great unhappiness to take this time to Fall out; and I think 'tis so great a Design, that it ought to be undertaken with the greatest Strength and Coalition in the Kingdom. Sayes he, My Friends are now gone so far, that they can't pull their Foot back again without going further; for sayes he, It hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to so many, that 'tis impossible to keep it from taking Air, and it must go on. Sayes he, We are not so unprovided as you think for; there are so many Men, that you will find as brisk Men as any in <hi>England.</hi> Besides, we are to have 1000 or 1500. Horse, that are to be drawn by insensible Parties into Town, that when the Insurrection is, shall be able to Scour the Streets, and hinder them from forming their Forces against us. My Lord, after great inlargement upon this Head, and Heads of the like nature, I told him I would not leave him thus, and that nothing should satisfy me, but an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view between him and the Lords: No, I could not obtain it: But if I would go and tell them what a Forwardness he was in, and that, if they would do themselves Right, by putting themselves upon correspondent Action in their respective Places, and where their Interest lay, well, otherwise he would go away without them. So I went again to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> I spake to him only (I never spake to my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> then, only we were together, but I had never come to any close conjunction of Counsels in my Life with him at that time.) Sayes I to the Duke, This Man is mad, and his Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will prove fatal to us all; he hath been in a Fright by being in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes those Fears about him, that cloud his Understanding: I think his Judgment hath deserted him, when he goes about with those strange sanguine Hopes, that I can't see what should Support him in the Ground of them. Therefore sayes I, Pray will you give him a Meeting. <hi>God-soe,</hi> sayes the Duke, with all my Heart, and I desire nothing more. Now, I told him, I had been with my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> with other Inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that I need not trouble your Lordship with: Well, sayes he, pray go to him, and try if it be possible to get a Meeting: So I went to him, and told him. Sayes I, This is a great unhappiness, and it seems to be a great Absurdity, that you are so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Act alone in such a thing as this. Pray, sayes I, without any more to do, since you have this Confidence to send for me, let me prevail with you to Meet them, and give them an Interview, or else you and I must break. I will no longer hold any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence, unless it be so. Sayes he, I tell you they will betray me. In short, he did with much importunity yield, That he would come out the next Nightin a Disguise. By this time it was <hi>Saturday,</hi> I take it to be the <hi>sixth</hi> of <hi>October</hi>; an <hi>Almanack</hi> will settle that: So the next Night being <hi>Sunday,</hi> and the Shops shut, he would come out in a Concealment, be carried in a Coach, and brought to his own House, which he thought then was safest. I came and gave the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> an Account of it; the Duke, I suppose, conveyed the same Understanding to my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>; and I suppose both would have been there accordingly, to have given the Meeting; but next Morning I found Collonel <hi>Romsey</hi> had left a Note at my House, that the Meeting could not be that Day. Then I went to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and he had had the Account before, That my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> did apprehend himself to be in some
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93094:24"/>
Danger in that House, and that the Apprehension had occasioned him to remove; but we should be sure to hear from him in two or three dayes. We took it as a Waver, and thought he did from thence intend to Abscond hinself from us, and it proved so to me, for from that time I never saw him. But Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> came to me and told me, that he was withdrawn, but it was for fear his Lodgeing might be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but he did not doubt, but in a week he would let me know, where his lodging was. But told me within such a time, which I think was 8 or 10 days, there would be a Rising: and I told the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and I believe he told my L. <hi>Russel</hi>; And we believed his Frenzy was now grown to that heigth, that he would Rise imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and put his design in execution; so we endeavoured to prevent it. Upon which my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> (I was told) and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> did force their way to my Lord <hi>Shaftsburyes,</hi> and did perswade him to put off the day of his Rendezvous. I had not this from my L. <hi>Russel,</hi> for I had not spoke a word to him; but the Duke told me, my L. <hi>Russel</hi> had been with him (I had indeed an intimation that he had been with him); but the Duke told me, says he, I have not been with him, but my L. <hi>Russel</hi> was, having been convey'd by Col. <hi>Romsey.</hi> After this day was put off, it seems it was put off with this condition, That those Lords, and divers others, should be in a readiness to raise the Country about that day Fortnight, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; for there was not above a Fortnight's time given: And says the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> we have put it off, but now we must be in Action, for there's no holding it off any longer. And says he, I have been at <hi>Wapping</hi> all night, and I never saw a Company of Bolder, and Brisker fellows in my life; And sayes he, I have been found the <hi>Tower,</hi> and seen the Avenues of it; and I do not think it will be hard in a little time, to possess our selves of it; But says he, they are in the wrong way; yet we are ingaged to be ready for them in a Fortnight, and therefore, says he, now we must apply our selves to it, as well as we can. And thereupon I believe they did send into the Country; and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> told me, he spake to Mr. <hi>Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> who was to take particular care of <hi>Sommerset-Shire,</hi> with this circumstance, Says he, I thought Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had been a brisker fellow; for when I told him of it, he looked so pale, I thought he would have swooned, when I brought him to the brink of Action; and said, I pray go and do what you can among your acquaintance: And truly I thought it would have come then to Action. But I went the next day to him, &amp; he said it was impossible; they could not get the Gent. of the Country to stir yet.</p>

                  <p>If it please you my Lord, Go on in the method of Time. This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against you, but it's coming to you, if your Lordship will have patience, I assure you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. <hi>Howard.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>This is just in the order it was done. When this was put off, then they were in a great hurry; &amp; Capt <hi>Walcot</hi> had been several times with me, &amp; discoursed of it. But upon this disappointment they said, it should be the dishonor of the Lords, that they were backward to perform their parts; but still they were resolv'd to go on. And this had carried it to the latter end of <hi>October.</hi> About the 17<hi>th</hi> or 18<hi>th</hi> Cap. <hi>Walcot</hi> came to me, and told me, now they were resolv'd positively to rise, and did believe that a smart Party might perhaps meet with some Great men. Thereupon I told the Duke of it; I met him in the street, &amp; went out, of my own Coach into his, &amp; told him, That there was some dark intimation, as if there might be some Attempt upon the Kings Person; with that he strook his breast with a great Emotion of spirit, &amp; said, Godsoe, Kill the KING! I will never suffer that. Then we went to the <hi>Play-House</hi> to find Sir <hi>Tho. Armstrong,</hi> &amp; send him up and down the City to put it off, as they did formerly; &amp; it was done with that Success, that we were all quieted in our minds, that at that time nothing would be done. But upon the day the King came from <hi>New-Market,</hi> we din'd together; the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was one, and there we had a notion conveyed among us, that some bold Action should be done that day; which comparing it with the Kings coming, we concluded it was design'd upon the King. And I remember my L. <hi>Gray,</hi> says he, By God, If they do Attempt any such thing, it can't fail. We were in great anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of mind, till we heard the Kings Coach was come in, and Sir <hi>Tho. Armstrong</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, we apprehended that he was to be one of the party (for he was not there). This failling, it was then next determined (which was the last Alarum and News I had of it) to be done upon the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> the Anniversary of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it by this Remark I made my self, That I fear'd it had been discovered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I saw a Proclamation a little before, forbidding publick Bonfires without Leave of my Lord <hi>Mayor.</hi> It made some impressions upon me; that I thought they had got
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93094:25"/>
an intimation of our Intention, and had therefore forbid that meeting. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the 17<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> being also disappointed, and my L. <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told things were not ripe in the Country, took Shipping and got away; and from that time, I heard no more of him, till I heard he was dead. Now Sir, after this, we all began to lye under the same Sense and Apprehensions that my L. <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> did, That we had gone so far, and communicated it to so many, that it was unsafe to make a Retreat; and this being considered, it was also considered, that so great an Affair as that was, consisting of such infinite Particulars, to be managed with so much sineness, and to have so many parts, it would be necessary, that there should be some General Council, that should take upon them the Care of the Whole. Upon these thoughts, we Resolved to Erect a little <hi>Caball</hi> among our selves, which did consist of Six Persons; and the Persons were, The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> Jun. <hi>Algernone Sidney,</hi> and my <hi>Self.</hi>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Attor. Gen.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>About what time was this, when you setled this Council?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. <hi>Howard.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>It would have been proper for me in the next place to tell you that, and I was coming to it. This was about the middle of <hi>January</hi> last, (as near as I can remember); for about that time, we did meet at Mr. <hi>Hambdens</hi> House.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Attor. Gen.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Name those that met.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. <hi>Howard.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>All the Persons I Named before: that was, The D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my L. <hi>Essex,</hi> my L. <hi>Russel,</hi> Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> Jun. and my Self. When we met there, it was presently agreed, what their proper Province was, which was to have a care of the Whole: And therefore it was necessary some General things should fall under our Care and Conduct, which could not possibly be Conducted by individual Persons. The things that did Principally challenge this Care, we thought were these; Whether the Insurrection was most Proper to be begun in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> or in the <hi>Country,</hi> or both at one instant. This stood upon several different Reasons: It was said in the Country; and I remember the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> insisted upon it, that it was impossible to oppose a Formed, well Methodiz'd, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Force, with a Rabble hastily got together; and therefore whatever Numbers could be gathered in the City, would be suppressed quickly before they could Form themselves: Therefore it would be better to begin it at such a distance from the Town, where they might have an Opportunity of Forming themselves, &amp; would not be subject to the like panick Fear, as in the Town, where half an Hour would convey the News to those Forces, that in another half Hour would be ready to suppress them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Attor. Gen.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Was this Determined among you all?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. <hi>Howard.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>In this manner that I tell you, Why it was necessary to be done at some Reasonable distance from the Town. And from thence it was likewise considered, that the being so remote from the Town, it would put the King upon this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> that either the King would send His Forces to subdue them, or not; if he did, He must leave the City Naked, vvho being <hi>Proximi Dispositioni</hi> to Action, it would give them Occasion to Rise, and come upon the back of the Kings Forces; if he did not send, it vvould give them time to Form their Number, and be better Ordered.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, We do not desire all your Discourse and Debates; What was your other General thing?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. <hi>Howard.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>The Other was, What Countries and Towns were the fittest and most disposed to Action: and the <hi>Third,</hi> What Arms were necessary to be got, and how to be disposed: And a <hi>Fourth,</hi> (which should have been indeed first in Consideration) propounded by the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> That it vvould be absolutely Necessary to have some Common Bank of 25. or 30000 <hi>l.</hi> to Answer the Occasions of such an Undertaking. Nothing was done, but these things were offered then to our Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we were to bring in our United Advice concerning them. But the Last and Greatest was, How we might so order it, as to draw <hi>Scotland</hi> into a consent with us, for we thought it necessary that all the Diversion should be given. This was the Last.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Then it was so far, as we came to a Resolution, That som Persons should be sent to my L. <hi>Argyle,</hi> to settle an Understanding with him, &amp; that some Messengers should be dispatcht'd into <hi>Scotland,</hi> that should invite some Persons hither, that were judged most able to Understand the Estate of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; give an Account of it: The persons agreed on were, Sir <hi>Iohn Cockram,</hi> my Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> and another, whose Name I have since

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I have heard (I never saw him in six Months before) that <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was sent.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>At. Gen.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Who was Intrusted to take care of that Business?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. <hi>Howard.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> We in discourse, did agree to refer it to Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> to have the care of sending a Person.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>At. Gen.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Who acquainted you <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was sent?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. <hi>Howard</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> told me he had sent him, and given him Sixty Guineys for his Journey.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>L. <hi>Howard</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>We did then consider that these Meetings might have occasioned some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation upon us, and agreed not to meet again till the return of that Messenger. He was gone I believe, near a Month before we heard any thing of him, which we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, and feared some miscarriage, but if his Letter had miscarried, it could have done no great hurt, for it carried only a kind of Cant in it; It was under the disguise of a Plantation in <hi>Carolina.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, If you will have a little Patience to hear me, I will tell you what it is presses you, there is this which I have mentioned, and Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> does say, there was a Paper purporting a Declaration then Read among the Company there, which was to be Printed upon the Rising, Setting forth the Oppressions and Greivances of the Nation And then my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> (after a great dicourse concerning the many designs of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>) comes particularly to your Lordship and says, that Six of you, as a chosen Counsel among your selves, (not that you were actually chosen) but as a chosen Counsel among your selves, did undertake to mannage the great matter of the Insurrection, and Raising of Men in order to surprize the Kings Guards, and for to Rise, (which is a Rebellion in the Nation.) He says that you had sever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>My Lord, I cannot but think my self mighty unfortunate to stand here charged with so High and Hainous a Crime, and that intricated and intermixed with the Treasons and horrid Practices and Speeches of other People, the Kings Counsel taking all advantages, and improving and heightning things against me. I am no Lawyer, a very unready speaker, and altogether a stranger to things of this Nature and alo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But my Lord, you are equal, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, I think, are Men of Consciences, they are Strangers to me, and I hope they value Innocent Blood, and will consider the Witnesses they may be accounted, they can't be Credible. And for Col <hi>Rumsey,</hi> who it's Notoriously known hath been so highly Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the King and the Duke, for him to be capable of such a design of Murdering the King! I think no body will wonder, if to save his own Life, he will endeavour to take away mine; neither does he Swear enough to do it. And then if he did, the Time by the 13<hi>th.</hi> of this King is Elapsed, it must be, as I understand by the Law, Prosecuted withiSix Months, and by the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. a design of Levying War is no Treason unless by some overt A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But then for the next Objection: surely My Lord is Informed wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To Raise a Rebellion or a Conspiracy within the Kingdom, is it not that which is called Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of War in that Statute, but to Raise a Number of Men to brake Prisons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is not so directly tending against the Life of the King. To prepare Forces to Fight against the King, that is a design within that Statute to Kill the King; And to design to depose the King, to Imprison the King, to Raise the Subjects against the King, these have been setled by several Resolutions to be Within that Statute, and Evidences of a design of Killing the King.</p>

                  <p>I do not think they have proved it.

                  <p>(To Colonel <hi>Rumsey,</hi>) Sir, did my Lord <hi>Russell</hi> hear you, when you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd the Message to the Company? were they at the Table, or where were they?</p>

                  <p>No, my Lord. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and my Lord <hi>Russell</hi> went away together, and my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong.</hi>

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and I came together, and you were standing at the Chimney when I came in; you were there before me. My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> hath made a long Narrative here of what he knew, I do not know when he made it, or when he did recollect any thing; 'tis but very lately, that he did Declare and Protest to several People, That he knew nothing against me, nor of any Plot, I could in the least, be Questioned for.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I chanced to be in Town the last Week, and hearing my Lord
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93094:28"/>
of <hi>Bedford</hi> was in some Distress and Trouble, concerning the Affliction of his Son, I went to give him a Visit, being my old Acquaintance, of some 53 Years standing, I believe, for my Lord and I was Bred together at <hi>Mandlin-College</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> I had not been there but a very little while, and was ready to go away again, after I had done the good Office I came about, but my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> came in, I don't know whether he be here.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Howard.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, here I am to serve your Lordship.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Anglesey.</speaker>
                  <p>And sat down on the other side of my Lord of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and he began to Comfort my Lord, and the Arguments he used for his Comfort, were, My Lord, You are happy in having a wise Son, and a worthy Person, one that can never sure be in such a Plot as this, or suspected for it, and that may give your Lordship reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a very good Issue concerning him. I know nothing against him, or any Body else, of such a Barbarous-Design, and therefore your Lordship may be Comforted in it. I did not hear this only from my Lord <hi>Howards</hi> Mouth, but at my own home upon the <hi>Monday</hi> after; for I use to go to <hi>Totteridge</hi> for fresh Air; I went down on <hi>Saturday,</hi> this happened to be on <hi>Friday,</hi> (my Lord being here, I am glad, for he can't forget this Discourse,) and when I came to Town on <hi>Monday,</hi> I understood that my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> upon that very <hi>Sunday</hi> had been at Church with my Lady <hi>Chaworth.</hi> My Lady has a Chaplain, it seems, that Preaches there, and does the Offices of the Church, but my Lady came to me in the Evening.

                  <p>My Lord, what you have from my Lady is no kind of Evidence at all.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Anglesey.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't know what my Lord is, I am acquainted with none of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; nor what hath been done. But my Lady <hi>Chaworth</hi> came to me, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, There was some suspition—</p>

                  <p>I don't think it fit for me to interrupt a Person of your Honour, my Lord, but your Lordship knows in what place we stand here, what you can say of any thing you heard of my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> we are willing to hear, but the other is not Evidence. As the Court will not let us offer hear-says, so neither must we that are for the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Anglesey.</speaker>
                  <p>I have told you what happened in my hearing.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> stood up.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. Just.</speaker>
                  <p>Come Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> what do you know?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Howard.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I must desire to say something of my Self and my Family first, My Lord and I have been very intimate, not only as Relations, but as dear Friends. My Lord, I have been of a Family known to have great Respect and Duty for the King, and I think there is no Family in the Nation so numerous, that hath expressed greater Loyalty, upon which account I improved my Interest in my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>; I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, upon the great Misunderstanding of the Nation, (if he be here he knows it,) to perswade him to apply himself to the King, to serve him in that great difficulty of State, which is known to all the World. I sometimes found my Lord very forward, and sometimes I soften'd him, upon which Parly, upon his permission, and more upon my own inclination of Duty, I made several Applications to Ministers of State, (and I can name them) that my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> had a great desire of serving the King in the best way of Satisfaction, and particularly in the great Business of his Brother. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd there should be so much sharpness for a matter of Opinion, and I told my Lord so, and we had several Disputes about it. My Lord, I do say this before I come to the thing. After this I did partly by his permission, and partly by my own inclination, to serve the King, because I thought my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> a Man of Parts, and saw him a Man that had interest in the Nation, tell my Lord <hi>Feversham,</hi> that I had prevailed with a Relation of mine, that may be he might think opposite, that perhaps might serve the King in this great Difficulty that is Emergent, and particularly that of his Brother. My Lord <hi>Feversham</hi> did receive it very kindly, and I writ a Letter to him, to let him know how I had sof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ned my Lord, and that it was my desire he should speak with my Lord at <hi>Oxon.</hi> My Lord <hi>Feversham</hi> gave me a very kind Account when he came again, but he told me—</p>

                  <p>Pray speak to this matter.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Howard.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Then now Sir, I will come to the Thing. Upon this ground, I had of my Lords kindness, I applied my self to my Lord in this present Issue, on the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this Plot. My Lord I thought certainly as hear as I could discern him (for he took it upon his Honor, his Faith, and as much as if he had taken an Oath before a Magistrate,) that he knew nothing of any Man concerned in this Business, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of my Lord <hi>Russell,</hi> whom he vindicated with all the Honour in the World. My Lord, it is true, was afraid of his own Person, and as a Friend, and a Relation, I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed him in my House, and I did not think it was for such a Conspiracy, but I thought he was unwilling to go to the Tower for nothing again. So that if my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> has the same Soul on <hi>Monday</hi>; that he had a <hi>Sunday,</hi> this can't be true, that he Swears against my Lord <hi>Russell.</hi> This I say upon my Reputation, and Honour, and something I could say more, he added, he thought my Lord <hi>Russell</hi> did not only unjustly Suffer, but he took God, and Men to Witnesse, He thought him the worthyest Person in the World. I am very sorry to hear any Man of my Name, should be Guilty of these Things.</p>

                  <p>Call Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi> Pray Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> did you hear any thing from my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> since the Plot was discovered concerning me.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was with me, the Night after the Plot broke out, and he did then, as he had done before, with Hands and Eyes, lifted up to Heaven, say he knew nothing of any Plot, nor believed any, and treated it, with great Scorn and Contempt.</p>

                  <p>I had the Honour to be acquainted with my Lord <hi>Russell</hi> a long time, I always thought him a Man of great Honour, and too Prudent and Wary a Man to be concerned in so Vile and Desperate a design as this, and from which he would receive so little advantage, I can say nothing more, but that Two or Three days since the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this Plot, upon discourse about Col. <hi>Rumsey,</hi> my Lord <hi>Russell</hi> did express something, as if he had a very ill Opinion of the Man, and therefore it is not likely he would intrust him with such a Secret.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I did not expect to have been spoken to upon this Account. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been very much with my Lord of late, that is for a Month or Six Weeks before this Plot came out, I have had occasion to speak with my Lord in private, about these Publick Matters. But I have always found that my Lord was against all kind of Risings, and thought it the greatest Folly and Madness, till things should come in a Parliamentary way. I have had occasion often to speak with my Lord <hi>Russell</hi> in private, and having my self been against all kind of Risings, or any thing that tended to the disorder of the Publick, I have heard him profess Solemnly, he thought it would Ruin the best Cause in the World to take any of these irregular ways for the preserving of it, and particularly my Lord hath expressed himself occasionally of these two Persons, my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:93094:29"/>
and Col. <hi>Rumsey.</hi> One of them, Col. <hi>Rumsey,</hi> I saw once at my Lords House, and he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to speak a little privatly. But my Lord told me he knew him but a little, I told him he was a Valiant Man, and acted his Part Valiantly in <hi>Portugal.</hi> He say'd he knew him little, and that he had nothing to do with him but in my Lord <hi>Shaftsburys</hi> business. He say'd, for my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> he was a Man of excellent Parts of Luxuriant Parts, but he had the luck not to be much trusted by any Party. And I never heard him say one word of Indecency, or Immodestly towards the King.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, if I took it right, my Lord <hi>Angleseys</hi> Testimony did Branch it self into Two Parts, one of his own Knowledg, and the other by Hear-say, as to what he sayd of his own knowledg, when I waited upon my Lord of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and endeavoured to comfort him, concerning his Son, I believe I sayd the words my Lord <hi>Anglesey</hi> has given an account of, as near as I can remember, that I looked upon his Lordship, as a Man of that Honour, that I hoped he might be secure, that he had not Intangled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in any thing of that Nature. My Lord, I can hardly be provoked to make my own defence, least this Noble Lord should Suffer, so willing I am to serve my Lord, who knows I can't want Affection for him, My Lord, I do confess I did say it; for your Lordship well knows under what Circumstances we were, I was at that time to out-face the thing, both for my self, and my Party, and I did not intend to come into this Place, and Act this Part. God knows how it is Brought upon me, and with what unwillingness I do Sustain it, but my Duty to God, the King, and my Country, requires it, but I must confess, I am very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to carry it on thus far. My Lord, I do confess I did say so, and if I had been to Visit my Lord <hi>Pember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> I should have say'd so, There is none of those that know my Lord <hi>Russell,</hi> but would speak of my Lord <hi>Russell,</hi> from those Topicks of Honour, Modesty, and Integrity, his whole Life deserves it. And I must confess, I did frequently say, there was nothing of Truth in this, and I wish this may be for my Lords advantage. My Lord, will you spare me one thing more, because that leans hard upon my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and if the Jury beleive that I ought not to be beleived, for I do think the Religion of an Oath, is not Tyed to a Place, but receives its Obligation from the appeal, we therein make to God, and I think, if I called God and Angels, to Witness to a Fals-hood, I ought not to be beleived now. But I will tell you, as to that, your Lordship knows, that very Man that was Committed, was Committed for a design of Murdering the King, now I did lay hold on that part, for I was to carry my Knife close between the Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Apple, and I did say, that if I were an Enemy to my Lord <hi>Russell,</hi> and to the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and were called to be a Witness, I must have declared in the presence of God, and Man, that I did not beleive either of them had any design to Murder the King. I have said this, because I would not walk under the Character of a Person, that would be Perjured at the expence of so Noble a Persons Luc, and my own Soul.</p>

                  <p>No, my Lord, I will be very short. I shall declare to your Lordship that I am one that have always had a heart sincerely Loyal and Affectionate to the King and the Government, the best Government in the world. I pray as sincerely for the Kings happy and long life as any man alive; and for me to go about to raise a Rebellion, which I looked upon as so wicked and unpracticable, is unlikely. Besides, if I had been inclined to it, by all the observation I made in the Country, there was no tendency to it. What some hot-headed people have done there, is another thing. A Rebellion can't be made now as it has been in former times; we have few great Men. I was always for the Government, I never desired any thing to be redressed but in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and Legal way. I have been always against Innovations, and all Irregularities whatsoever, and shall be as long as I live, whether it be sooner or later. Gentlemen, I am now in your hands eternally, my Honour, my Life, and all; and I hope the Heats and Animosities that are amongst you will not so byass you, as to make you in the least incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to find an Innocent man guilty. I call to witness Heaven and Earth, I never had a design against the Kings Life in my life, nor never shall have. I think there is nothing proved against me at all, I am in your hands, God direct you.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the Prisoner at the Bar stands Indicted for High Treason, in Conspiring the Death of the King. The Overt Act that is laid to prove that Conspiracy and imagination by, is the assembling in Council to raise Arms against the King, and raise a Rebellion here. We have proved that to you by Three Witnesses. I shall endeavour as clearly as I can to state the substance of the Evidence to you, of every one of them as they have delivered it.</p>
                  <p>The first Witness Colonel <hi>Romsey</hi> comes, and he tells you of a Message he was sent of to Mr. <hi>Sheppards</hi> house to my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> with several other persons who he was told would be there assembled together. And the Message was, to know what readiness they were in, what Resolutions they were come to concerning the Rising at <hi>Taunton.</hi> By this you do perceive that this Conspiracy had made some progress, and was ripe to be put in action. My Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> that had been a great Contriver in it, he had pursued it so far, as to be ready to rise. This occasioned the Message from my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> to my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> and those Noble persons that were met at Mr. <hi>Sheppards</hi> house, to know what the Resolution was concerning the business of <hi>Taunton,</hi> which you have heard explained by an undertaking of Mr. <hi>Trenchards:</hi> That the answer was, they were disappointed there, and they could not then be ready, and that my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> must be content. This Message was delivered in presence of my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>; the Messenger had notice my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was there; the Answer was given as from them all, That at present they could not be ready, because of that disappointment. Col. <hi>Romsey</hi> went further, and he Swears there was a Discourse concerning the Surprizing of the Guards; and the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> went to see in what posture they were in, whether it were feasible to surprize them, and they found them very remiss; and that account they brought back, as is proved to you by Mr. <hi>Sheppard,</hi> the other Witness, That it was a thing very feasible. But to conclude with the substance of Col. <hi>Romseys</hi> Evidence, he says, my Lord was privy to it, that he did discourse among the rest of it, though my Lord was not a man of so great discourse as the rest, and did talk of a Rising. He told you there was a Rising determined to be on the 19th of <hi>November</hi> last, which is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Col. <hi>Romseys</hi> Evidence.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, the next Witness is Mr. <hi>Sheppard,</hi> and his Evidence was this: he Swears that about <hi>October</hi> last, Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> came to him of a Message from the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> to let him know, that he and some other persons of Quality would be there that night; that accordingly they did meet and my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was there likewise; that they did desire to be private, and his Servants were sent away; and that he was the man that did attend them. He Swears there was a discourse-concerning the way and method to seize the Guards; he goes so far, as to give an account of the Return of the Errand the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> went upon, That it was feasible if they had strength to do it. Then he went a little farther, and he told you there was a Paper read, that in his Evidence does not come up to my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> for he did not say my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was by, and I would willingly repeat nothing but what concerns the Prisoner. This therefore Col. <hi>Romsey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> agree in, That there was a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate among them how to surprize the Guards, and whether that was feasible, and Mr. <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard</hi> is positive as to the return made upon the view.</p>
                  <p>The next Witness was my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>; he gives you an account of many things,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93094:30"/>
and many things that he tells you are by hearsay. But I cannot but observe to you, that all this hearsay is confirmed by these two positive Witnesses, and their Oaths agree with him in it. For my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> told him of the disappointment he had met with from these Noble Persons that would not joyn with him; and then he went from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to expostulate with him about it (for my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was then ready to be in action) and that the Duke said he always told him, he would not engage at that time. This thing is confirmed to you by these two Witnesses. Col. <hi>Romsey</hi> says, when he brought the Message from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> the answer was. They were not ready, my Lord must be contented.</p>
                  <p>Next he goes on with a discourse concerning my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> (that does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ly come up to the Prisoner at the Bar, but it manifests there was a Designe at that time) he had 10000 brisk Boys (as he called them) ready to follow him upon the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up his finger. But it was thought not so prudent to begin it, unless they could joyn all their Forces. So you hear in this they were disappointed: And partly by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accident too my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> had an apprehention it might be discovered, that was upon the Proclamation that came out forbidding Bonfires, to prevent the ordinary Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lts that used to be upon those occasions. Then my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> goes on and comes particularly to my Lord <hi>Russel:</hi> for upon this disappointment you, find my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> thought fit to be gone. But after that, the Designe was not laid aside: for you hear they onely told him all along they could not be ready at that time, but the Designe went on still to raise Arms, and then they took upon themselves to consult of the methods of it; and for the carrying it on with the greater secrecy, they chose a select Council of Six, which were the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Effix,</hi> my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> and Col. <hi>Sidney.</hi> That accordingly they met at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s (there was their first meeting) and their Consultation there was, how the Insurrection should be made, whether first in <hi>London,</hi> or whether first in the Country, or whether both in <hi>London</hi> and in the Country at one time. They had some Debates among themselves that it was fittest first to be in the Country; for if the King should send his Guards down to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them, then the City that was then as well disposed to rise, would be without a Guard, and easily effect their designes here.</p>
                  <p>Their next meeting was at my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s own house, and there their Debates were still about the same matter, how to get in <hi>Scotland</hi> to their assistance; and in order to that, they did intrust Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> one of their Counsel to send a Messenger into <hi>Scotland</hi> for some persons to come hither, my Lord <hi>Melvin,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Cambell,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Cockram.</hi> Accordingly Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> sends <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> (but this is onely what Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> told my Lord afterwards, that he had done it, but) you see the fruit of it. Accordingly they are come to Town, and Sir <hi>Hugh Cambell</hi> is taken by a Messenger upon his arrival; and he had been but four days in Town, and he had changed his Lodging three times.</p>
                  <p>Now, Gentlemen, this is the substance of the Evidence that hath been produced against my Lord <hi>Russel.</hi> My Lord <hi>Russel</hi> hath made several Objections, That he was accidentally at this meeting at Mr. <hi>Shephards</hi> house, and came about other business; but I must observe to you, that my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> owned that he came along with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and I think he said he went away with him too. You observe what Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was: Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> came to tell him the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would come, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did come, and brought his Companion along with him, which was my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>; and certainly they that met upon so secret an Affair, would n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver have brought one that had not been concerned. Gentlemen, there are other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections my Lord hath made, and those are in point of Law; but before I come to them, I would observe what he says to the second Meeting. My Lord does not deny but that he did meet both at Mr. <hi>Hambdens</hi> house and my Lords own: I think my Lord said they did meet onely to discourse of News; and my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> being a man of excellent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, they met for his conversation. Gentlemen, you can't believe that this designed Meeting was for nothing, in this close secret Meeting that they had no contrivance among them. You have heard the Witness, he swears positively what the Conversation was; and you see the fruit of it, Sir <hi>Hugh Cambell</hi>'s coming to Town, and absconding when it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Now my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> insists upon it, that admitting these Facts be proved upon him, they amount to no more than to a Conspiracy to levy War, and that that is not Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son within the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and if it be onely within the Statute of the 13th of this King, then 'tis out of time, that directs the prosecution to be within six months. The Law is plainly otherwise. The Statute of the 13th of this King I will not now insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though I believe if that be strictly looked into, the clause that says the prosecution
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93094:30"/>
shall be within six months, does not refer to Treason, but only to the other offences that are highly punishable by that Statute. For the Proviso runs thus:</p>

To conspire to levy War, is an Overt Act to restifie the design of the death of the King. And the errour of my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> hath possibly led my Lord into this mistake. But this, Gentlemen, hath been determined; it was resolved by all the Judges in the Case of my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> 1 <hi>Iac.</hi> A Conspiracy to levy War against the Kings person (as this was a Conspiracy to seize the Guards) what does that tend to, but to seize the King? and that always hath been taken to be High Treason. But there are some things called levying of War in Law, that are not so direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the King; as if a number of men go about to levy men to overthrow all. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closures, this by the generality of the intent, and because of the consequences, is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted levying War against the King. A Conspiracy therefore to levy such a War which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction only is against the King, perhaps that may not be such an Overt act as to testifie the imagination of the death of the King; but other Conspiracies to raise War against the King have always so been taken. 'Tis the Resolution of all the Judges in my Lord <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> Reports, the Case of Dr. <hi>Story.</hi> A Conspiracy to invite a forrein Prince to make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion, though no Invasion follow, is an Overt act to prove conspiring the death of the King. And as it has been so taken, so it hath been practised but of late days. In the King's Bench I take it, the Indictment against <hi>Plunket</hi> that was hanged, he was indicted for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring against the Life of the King, and his Charge went no further than for raising of Arms, and inviting the French King in; and he suffered. This is acknowledged by my Lord <hi>Cook</hi>; for he himself said in the Paragraph before that out of which this advice to my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> is extracted, That a Conspiracy to invite a forein Prince to invade the Kingdom, is a Conspiracy against the Life of the King. And in the next Paragraph, he says an Overt act of one Treason cannot be an Overt act of another Treason; but constant practice is against him in that: For what is more common, than to indict a man for imagining the death of the King, and to assign the Overt act in a Conspiracy to raise Arms against the King? and sometimes they go on and say, Did levy War against the King. Now by my Lord <hi>Cook</hi>'s rule, levying War, unless the Indictment be particular for that, is not an Overt act for the compassing the death of the King; but the contrary hath been resolved by all the Judges in the Case of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> and it is the constant practice to lay it so in Indictments. It would be a strange construction if this should not be High Treason. 'Tis agreed by every body, to take the King Prisoner, to seize the King, that is a compassing of the death of the King: And to sit in counsel to conspire to effect that, that is an Overt act of the imagination of the death of the King: now no man can distinguish this case from that. And this Consultation amounted to all this; for plainly thither it tended. The Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to seize upon the Kings Guards, that could have no other stop but to seize upon the Kings person, and bring him into their power. As to the Killing of the King, I am apt to think that was below the honour of the Prisoner at the Bar; but this is equal Treason: If they designed only to bring the King into their power, till he had consented to such things as should be moved in Parliament, 'tis equally Treason as if they had agreed directly to assassinate him. Therefore I think there is nothing for you to consider, but to see that the fact be fully proved; and I see nothing that hath been sald by my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> that does invalidate our Evidence. He hath produced several Witnesses, persons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: my Lord <hi>Anglesey</hi> he tells you of a discourse my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> had with my Lord of <hi>Bedford</hi>; That he told my Lord of <hi>Bedford</hi> that he needed not to fear, for he had a wise and understanding Son, and could not think he should be guilty of any such thing as was laid to his charge. This is brought to invalidate my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s testimony. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, do but observe, My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was as deep in as any of them, and was not then discovered: is it likely that my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> that lay hid, should discover to my Lord of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93094:31"/>
                     <hi>Bedford</hi> that there was a Conspiracy to raise Arms, and that he was in it? This would have been an aspertion upon my Lord of <hi>Bedford,</hi> that any such thing should have been said.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Howard</hi> is the next, and he proves, That my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> used solemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations that he knew nothing of this Conspiracy. I did observe, that worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the beginning of his discourse (for it was pretty long) said first that he had been several times tempting my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> to come over, and be serviceable to the King, and if he knew any thing, that he would come and confess it. Why Gentlemen Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> that had come to him upon these Errands formerly, and had thought he had gained him, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you do not wonder if my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> did not reveal himself to him, who presently would have discovered it for, for that Errand he came. But if my Lord had had a design to have come in and saved his Life, he would have made his submission voluntarily, and made his Discovery. But my Lord tells nothing till he is pinched in his Conscience, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the guilt (being then in custody) and then he tells the whole truth, that which you have heard this day.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, this hath been all that hath been objected against the Witnesses, except what is said by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>; and he says that my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> declared to him, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there was no Plot, and laughed at it. Why Gentlemen, the Dr. would take it ill to be thought a person fit to be intrusted with the discovery of this; therefore what he said to him signifies nothing, for 'tis no more than this, that he did not discover it to the Dr.</p>
                  <p>But the last Objection (which I see there has been a great many persons of Honour and Quality called to) is, That 'tis not likely my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> should be guilty of any thing of this kind, being a man of that Honour, Vertue, and so little blameable in his whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. I do confess Gentlemen this is a thing that hath weight in it. But consider on the other hand, my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> is but a man, and hath his Humane frailties about him. Men fall by several temptations; some out of revenge, some by malice fall into such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences as these are: my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> is not of that temper, and therefore may be these are not the ingredients here. But Gentlemen, there is another great and dang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This hath been a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous temptation to many, and many persons of Vertue have fallen into it, and 'tis the only way to tempt persons of Vertue; and the Devil knew it, for he that tempted the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Vertue, shew'd him all the Kingdoms of the world, and said, <hi>All these will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</hi> Though he be a person of Vertue, yet it does not follow, but his Vertue may have some weak part in him.

I see no contradiction, no correspondence, no contrivance at all between them. You have plain Oaths before you, and I hope you will consider the weight of them, and the great consequence that did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this case, the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

I hope you will consider the weight of this Evidence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the consequences such a Conspiracy, if it had taken effect, might have had. And so I leave it to your consideration upon the Evidence you have heard.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, this Cause hath detained your Lordship a long time, by reason of so many Witnesses being called, and the length of the defence made by the Prisoner at the Bar; and if it had not been for the length I would not have injured your patience by saying any thing, Mr. Sollicitor having taken so much pains in it. It is a duty incumbent upon me, under the circumstances I now stand, to see if any thing hath been omitted that hath not been observed to you; and I shall detain you with very few words.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you must give me leave to tell you, 'tis a Case of great consequence, of great consequence to that Noble Person that now is at the Bar, as well as to the King: for it is not desired by the King nor by his Counsel, to have you influenced in this matter by any thing but by the truth, and what Evidence you have received. You are not to be moved by compassion or pity: the Oath you have taken is to go according to your Evidence; and you are not to be moved by any insinuations that are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us for the King, nor by any insinuations by the Prisoner at the Bar, but the truth according to the Testimony given, must be your Guide. How far the Law will affect this Question, that we are not to apply to you for; for that we are to apply our selves to the Court (they are the Judges in point of Law) who will take so much care in their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

to you, that you may be ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y well satisfied you will not easily be led into errour. For the instances that have been pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, I could put several others, But I will take notice onely of one thing that that Noble Person at the Bar seems to object. Gentlemen, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary there should be two Witnesses to the self-same Fact at the self-same time; but if there be two Witnesses tending to the self-same Fact, though it was at several times, and upon several occasions, they will be in point of Law two Witnesses which are necessary to convict a man for High-Treason. Gentlemen, I make no doubt this thing is known to you all, not onely by the Judgment of all the Judges in <hi>England,</hi> but the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords in Parliament, when I doubt not the Prisoner at the Bar did attend in the Case of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> wherein one Witness gave an account of a Conspiracy in <hi>England, Turbervile</hi> of another in <hi>France</hi>; and by the Opinion of all my Lords the Judges, approved in Parliament, that was enough, and he was convicted.</p>
                  <p>The Question is, whether we have sufficiently proved this matter. Gentlemen, I must tell you, we rake no Gaols, nor bring any pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>gate Persons, Persons that wanted faith or credit before this time. I must tell you, that notwithstanding the fair notice that hath been given to the Prisoner at the Bar (that you see he hath taken an advantage of it, he hath given an account of a private Conversation with my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> before that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Person that was Witness against him was taken) he has not given you in all his Proof hitherto, nay I say, he has not pretended any thing in the world: wherefore you, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that are upon your Oaths, should take it upon your Consciences, that two men, against whom there is no Objection, should come to damn their own Souls to take away the life of this Gentleman; when there is no Quarrel, no Temptation wherefore these Gentlemen should come in the face of a Court of Justice, in the face of such an Auditory, without respect to that infinite Being to whom they appeal for confirmation of the truth of their Testimony: And if they had the faith of men or Christians, they must necessarily conclude, that if they did swear to take away a mans life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat was innocent, God would sink them down presently into Hell.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, in the next place I must acquaint you, that the first Witness, Col. <hi>Romsey,</hi> it is apparent he was taken notice of by the Prisoner as a man fit to be trusted, he was engaged by my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury:</hi> But, says he, would any man believe that that man that had received so many Marks of the Kings Favour, both in advantage to his Estate, his Honour, and Person, could be ever contriving such an Hellish Designe as this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gentlemen, if you will argue from such uncertain Conjectures, then all Criminals will come off. Who should think that my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> who had been advanced so much in his Estate and Honour, should be guilty of such desperate things! which had he not been conselous of, he would scarcely have brought himself to that untimely end, to avoid the methods of publick Justice. Col. <hi>Romsey</hi> tells you my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was concerned in this Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. I am sorry to find that there have been so many of the Nobility of this Land that have lived so happily under the benign influence of a gracious Prince, should make so ill returns. Gentlemen, I must appeal to you whether in your observation you found Col. <hi>Romsey</hi> to be over-hasty and an over-zealous Witness; he did not come as if he came in spight to the Prisoner at the Bar: you found how we were forced to pump out every thing; but after he had been pressed over and over again, then he came to it: So that I observe to you, that he was an unwilling Witness.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, give me leave to observe to you, the Prisoner at the Bar, before such time as Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> came up and gave Evidence against him, says he, I come only by accident, only to tast a parcel of wine. Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> when he comes up, he tells you, there was no such design. <hi>Ferguson</hi> (that was the person he kept company with, the Reverend Dean and the rest of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they were not fit to be trusted with it, but this Independent Parson <hi>Ferguson</hi>) he gives notice of the coming of these persons, and in pursuance of this notice they all come, they come late, in the evening, not in the posture and quality they use to go, for you find they had not so much as a Coach. Is it probable they came to tast Wine? Wherefore did they go up into a room? Wherefore did they order Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> that none of the Boys should come up, but that the Master must fetch the Sugar and Wine himself? wherefore you may perceive the action they were upon, there were only to be such persons as had an affection for such a cause. You find pursuant to what Col. <hi>Romsey</hi> says, that there was a direction to take a view of the Guards, that Sir <hi>Tho. Armstrong</hi> comes back and makes this Report: says he, I have taken notice they are in such an idle careless posture, that it is not impossible to surprize them. This Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> he does not come, nor does he appear to you to come here out of any vindictive humor, to do the Prisoner at the Bar any hurt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:93094:32"/>In the next place we have my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> he comes and positively tells you after he had given an account (for you observe there were two parts to be acted in this horrid Tragedy; there was first the Scoundrel sort of people were to be concerned to take away the Life of the King and the Duke, the Great persons were to head the party in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing) they put themselves in proper postures, each of them consenting to something of the Surprize, inasmuch as you observe that Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> and some other persons might not be trusted. They come and resolve themselves out of a General Council, and they meet in a particular Council of Six, looking upon themselves as the Heads of the Party: And I must tell you many of them (we live not in an Age of such obscurity, but we know them) how fond have they been of the applause of the people! As that person incouraged himself yesterday, they were <hi>Liberatores Patriae</hi> that could murder the King and the Duke.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I must take notice that this Noble Lord is known to have an intimacy with him; you observe with how much tenderness he is pleased to deliver himself, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully he reports the Debates of the particular Consults of the persons to be intrusted in the management; he tells you that Noble Lord the Prisoner at the Bar was pitched upon, and <hi>Algernoone Sidney,</hi> a man famous about the Town, for what? To call in parties from some of his Majesties other Dominions, persons we know ripe enough for Rebellion, to assist. Pursuant to this, you find persons sent of a Message for some to come over, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some are in hold: So that for all dark and obscure sort of matters, nothing can be brought better to light than this, of taking all matters together, with the concurring Circumstances of Time and Place.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I must confess this Noble Lord hath given an account by several Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable persons of his Conversation; which is a very easie matter. Do you think if any man had a design to raise a Rebellion against the Crown, that he would talk of it to the Reverend Divines, and the Noble Lords that are known to be of Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Crown? Do you think the Gentleman at the Bar would have so little concern for his own life, to make this Discourse his ordinary Conversation? No, it must be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Consult of Six, that must be intrusted with this. I tell you, 'tis not the Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but an Independent Divine, that is to be concerned in this; they must be persons of their own complexion and humour. For men will apply themselves to proper instruments.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I would not labour in this case; for far be it from any man to endeavour to take away the life of the innocent. And whereas that Noble Lord says, he hath a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous good Lady, he hath many Children, he hath Vertue and Honour he puts into the Scale: Gentlemen, I must tell you on the other side, you have Consciences, Religion; you have a Prince, and a merciful one too; consider the life of your Prince, the life of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, the consequences that would have attended if this Villany had taken effect. What would have become of your Lives and Religion? What would have become of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion we have been so fond of preserving? Gentlemen, I must put these things home upon your Consciences. I know you will remember the horrid Murder of that most pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince the Martyr, King <hi>Charles</hi> the First. How far the practices of those persons have influenced the several punishments since, is too great a secret for me to examine. But now I say you have the life of a merciful King, you have a Religion that every honest man ought to stand by, and I am sure every Loyal man will venture his Life and Fortune for. You have your Wives and Children. Let not the greatness of any man corrupt you, but discharge your Consciences both to God and the King, and to your Posterity.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the Prisoner at the Bar stands indicted before you of High Treason, in compassing and designing the death of the King, and in declaring of it by Overt acts, endeavouring to raise Insurrections and popular Commotions in the Kingdom here. To this he hath pleaded Not Guilty. You have heard the Evidence that hath been against him, it hath been at large repeated by the Kings Counsel, which will take off a great deal of my trouble in repeating it to you again. I know you cannot but take notice of it, and remember it, it having been stated twice by two of the Kings Counsel to you; 'tis long, and you see what the parties here have proved.

                        </gap>y,</hi> he does attest a Meeting at Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi>'s house, and you hear to what purpose he says it was, the Message that he brought, and the Return he had; it was to enquire concerning a Rising at <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nton</hi>; and that he had in return to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was, that Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had failed them, and my Lord must be contented, for it could not be that time. You hear that he does say that they did design a Rising; he saith there was a Rising designed in <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> I think he saith the 17th, upon the day of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s birth. You hear he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93094:32"/>
does say, there was at that Meeting some discourse concerning inspecting the Kings Guards, and seeing how they kept themselves, and whether they might be surprized; and this he says was all in order to a Rising. He says that at this my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> does say, that my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was there: That he came into this Meeting with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and he did go away with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> as he believes. He says there was some discourse of a Rising or Insurrection that was to be procured within the Kingdom; but he does not tell you the particulars of any thing, he himself does not. My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> afterwards does come and tell you of a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course he had with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> in order to a Rising in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> did value himself mightily upon 10000 men he hoped to raise; and a great deal of discourse he had with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> This he does by way of induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to what he says concerning my Lord <hi>Russel.</hi> The Evidence against him is some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults that there were by Six of them, who took upon them, as he says, to be a Council for the management of the Insurrection that was to be procured in this Kingdom. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in two that were for this purpose; the one of them at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s house, the other at my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s house. And he tells you at these Meetings there was some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of providing Treasure, and of providing Arms, but they came to no result in these things. He tells you, that there was a design to send for some of the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that might joyn with them in this thing. And this is upon the matter the substance of the Evidence that hath been at large declared to you by the King's Counsel, and what you have heard. Now, Gentlemen, I must tell you, some things it lies upon us to direct you in.</p>
                  <p>My Lord excepts to these Witnesses, because they are concerned by their own shewing in this Design: If there were any, I did direct (some of you might hear me) yesterday, that that was no sufficient exception against a mans being an Evidence in the case of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that he himself was concerned in it; they are the most proper persons to be Evidence, none being able to detect such Councils but them. You have heard my Lord <hi>Russels</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that he hath brought concerning, them, and concerning his own integrity and course of life, how it has been sober and civil, with a great respect to Religion, as these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do all testifie. Now the Question before you will be, whether upon this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you do believe my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> had any design upon the Kings life, to destroy the King, or take away his life, for that is the material part here. 'Tis used and given you (by the King's Counsel) as an evidence of this, That he did conspire to raise an Insurrection; and to cause a Rising of the people, to make as it were a Rebellion within the Nation, and to surprize the King's Guards, which say they can have no other end but to seize and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the King; and 'tis a great evidence (if my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> did design to seize the King's Guards, and make an Insurrection in the Kingdom) of a design for to surprize the King's Person. It must be left to you upon the whole matter: You have not evidence in this Case as there was in the other matter that was tried in the morning or yesterday, against the Conspirators to kill the King at the <hi>Rye.</hi> There was a direct evidence of a Consult to kill the King, that is not given you in this Case; this is an act of contriving Rebellion and an Insurrection within the Kingdom, and to seize his Guards, which is urged as an evidence, and surely is in it self an evidence to seize and destroy the King.</p>
                  <p>Upon this whole matter this is left to you. If you believe the Prisoner at the Bar to have conspired the death of the King, and in order to that to have had these Consults that these Witnesses speak of, then you must find him Guilty of this Treason that is laid to his Charge.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Court adjourned till four a Clock in the Afternoon, when the Iury brought the said Lord</hi> Russel <hi>in Guilty of the said High Treason.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, I have had no liberty so much as sending for my Wife. <hi>Monday</hi> Morning they gave me notice of Tryal, but I have had no advantage of that notice; I presumed it is meant we should have the liberty of Subjects, but though notice was then given, yet I had not the liberty of sending for any body till <hi>Wednesday.</hi> It was 8 or 9 of the Clock on <hi>Wednesday</hi> night that one came and told me, I should have no liberty of Counsell unless I had it from the Court; and yesterday morning I found that Captain <hi>Blage</hi> and I were joyned in one Indictment, which alters the case with submission to the Court. What time I have had for Tryal has been so short, I have not been able to get my Witnesses ready. I desire nothing but as an <hi>English</hi> man.</p>

                  <p>As an <hi>English-man</hi> you can demand no time to prepare, for Tryal, for those that will commit crimes they must be ready to answer for them, and defend themselves. 'Tis Matter of Fact you are charged with, you knew long agoe what you were to be Tryed for, for you were taken up and charged with High Treason. You might then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably consider what kind of Evidence would be against you; if you be an innocent person you may defend your self without question. But if you have done an ill thing, the Law does not design to give you time to shelter your self under any subterfuge, or make any excuse, or to prepare any Witnesses to testify an untrue thing for you.</p>

                  <p>The Prisoner at the Bar was (as you have been acquainted) in that horrid conspiracy, whereof several of the Conspirators have been brought to Tryal, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Verdict surely according to Evidence. The Prisoner at the Bar did bear a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion among the rest. It does occur to your memorys, There were several undertakers that undertook several stations; some whereof were to undertake the blackest part of this horrid Villany, by the taking off the King and his R. Highness his Brother; others (in order to the same design) were to seize upon the King's Guards, and so to deprive him of all manner of defence whatsoever, and to prevent all persons to make any defence against them, as you heard there was another part to be acted, therefore the Town was to be divided into several Divisions, I think there was Twenty, but the most numerous and beneficial parts were thought to be about <hi>Wapping.</hi> A particular part of the Evidence was, that the Tower was to be seized and the Kings Arms there, I know you observed that they took notice of a particular place of the Tower that was most capable of access. This <hi>Rouse</hi> is a Gentleman very well known, 'tis not the first time he hath been at this Barr: He was here at a time when the common justice of the Nation could not be obtained in this place, in so much that the Judges who came to execute Justice, had more reason to fear being executed upon the Bench than the Prisoner at the Bar. It may easily appear how

far Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> was concerned (I don't love to aggravate matters, he has crimes enough) he was reckoned Pay master to this rabble, he was to take care to manage those persons that were to seize upon the Tower. He is a man of great skill in that subject, a Doctrine wherein he was well tuto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We shall give you an account of a design he had how to compass this business. <hi>Black heath</hi> was looked upon as a convenient place, where there was to be a Golden Ball, for which the Sea-men were to play in great numbers, and he that won the prize was to have the Golden Ball, but his eye was upon the Tower all this while. He thought to allure these silly Sea-men by the advantage of the honourable winning of this Ball, and when they were fraighted with the success of this meeting, then it was proper to attack the Tower. We shall prove the other Prisoner that was at the Barr ingaged with this Prisoner at the Barr. We shall not only prove this, but that Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> hath been always of an inclination against the Government. We shall call you Witnesses, that he hath undertaken to dispute by what Authority the King comes to govern into <hi>England,</hi> that he hath said <hi>he had forfeited his Government,</hi> that he told an ordinary Miscreant one of his Levellers, <hi>that he had as much right to the Crown as he had.</hi> My Lord, if we prove this matter to your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, it will be high time for us to endeavour to preserve the Crown upon that Royal Head, upon which all Loyal men desire it should flourish as long as the Sun and Moon indure.</p>

                  <p>If it please you my Lord, I have been concerned in this Conspiracy, I know something of it, but I believe Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> knows a great deal more. Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> takes me to the <hi>Kings head</hi> Tavern in <hi>Swithins-Alley,</hi> where after some time Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> came, where there was a Clubb of men that was in the Conspiracy. I had seen Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough</hi> before, he acquainted me that there was an apprehension our <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> were Invaded, and it was time to look to our selves, for <hi>Popery</hi> was designed, and <hi>Arbitrary power</hi>; and therefore he desired to know whether I would ingage in that affair to prevent it, and withall he told me, the City of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middlesex</hi> was divided in Twenty-parts, and he asked me to ingage in one part. I told him, my acquaintance did not ly where I lived, but I would get a part where my acquaintance was. I acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> what men I had spoke to Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> told me, the design was to set up the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and kill the King and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> but that all Parties must not know of it: But that we must tell some people there was like to be a Foraign Invasion, and ask them what readiness they were in, and if we found they were like to be compliant in that, then we might discourse with them about the other matter. I discoursed with several men about this affair: and he told me, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen were to be killed immediately, (especially the present Lord Mayor Sir <hi>Iohn Moor</hi>) and their houses plundred, and there would be Riches enough, and that would help to maintain the Army, and we went on further in this discourse. Then I acquainted Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> with this business, but he knew of it before, and he did tell me he could provide Arms for an Hundred men, and said nothing was to be done unless the King was seized; saying, we remember since <hi>Forty One</hi> the King went and set up his standard; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (says he) we will seize them, that they shall not set up their Standard. But (says he) I am for seizing them; but not for shedding their blood. Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> went off with that discourse, says he, I must speak with Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> and some of those that are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concerned.

a Ball played upon <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> and to that end we must speak to some Sea Captains, and (says he) I will ingage Ten, and they shall manage that affair, and he that wins the Ball take it. But when they have so done, every Captain shall take his Party, and tell them they have other work, and then go with long Boats and Arms and seize the Tower. I acquainted Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> with this, and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> asked me the charge of the Golden Ball, Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> had told me it would be Ten or a Dozen Pounds; Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough</hi> said, if it was Forty Pound he would be at the charge of it all. Several such discourses Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> hath in my hearing spoke to several men at the <hi>Kings-Head</hi> Tavern. I understood I was Sworn against, I heard of it at the <hi>Kings Head</hi> Tavern in his Company and Mr. <hi>Goodenough's.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> directed me to go to the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern near <hi>Moorgate,</hi> and he would come to me, and there Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> came to me, and Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> told me I should ly at his house. Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> cut off my hair, and went to Mr. <hi>Bateman's</hi> and fetched me a Perriwigg; Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> and I went several times to view the Tower, and took Mate <hi>Lee</hi> along with us. So Mate <hi>Lee</hi> directed us to <hi>Traitors-Bridge,</hi> and he said that was an easy place, and he would undertake to do it with an Hundred men, so they had but hand Granadoes. We had some time before that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to meet at <hi>Wapping,</hi> to speak with the Sea-Captains Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> met the first day in order to this business at the <hi>Amsterdam</hi> Coffee house, and there Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> met with two Sea-Captains (as he told me, that were to officiate in this business, and the Two Captains he took to the <hi>Angel and Crown</hi> in <hi>Threadneedle-street.</hi> A small time after, about an hour and a half or thereabouts, Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> came (I am not positive whether Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough</hi> were there or no) and told me, he had spoke to both the Sea-Captains, and they were willing, but one was going to <hi>New Iersy,</hi> and therefore the work must be done before he went, or he could not assist: another time he appointed Mate <hi>Lee</hi> to meet at the <hi>Anchor</hi> in <hi>Wapping.</hi> I did speak to Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> but he did not meet us, so that we could not go down that day, but Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> always undertook that business to get Ten Sea-Captains, and get Armes for an Hundred men. After I was Sworn against, and went to Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi>'s house; the next day Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> came to me to Mr. <hi>Rouse's,</hi> says Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> be not discouraged, let the business go on. I was directed by Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> when ever I was taken into Custody I should <hi>deny</hi> all, and it could not <hi>touch</hi> my life. I thank him for his kindness, I lay well, and eat well at his house, my Lord; but however I will tell the truth. We met afterwards several times, and went to Captain <hi>Blage's,</hi> and the rest of the Company, but at different places. We had an accompt that Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> was in the North raising men, and that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was thereabouts, and that a deliverance should be wrought for all this.</p>

                  <p>The whole truth I will tell. About a week before <hi>Midsummer</hi> or thereabouts I met Mr. <hi>Rouse,</hi> I think it was in <hi>Popes-Head</hi> Alley, going to look after Captain <hi>Blage</hi>: says Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> I have something to say to you, but he did forbear speaking it then; so I went to the <hi>Kings head</hi> Tavern by the <hi>Exchange,</hi> we went into a little Room; says he, there is something I would have you do. Whats that? says I. Says he, can't you get some Sea-men sitting to make Commanders of Ships. I did not understand Mr. <hi>Rouse's</hi> meaning in it, but I thought Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> being in Employment might put me in, being destitute of employment, as well as other men. So after we did appoint to meet at <hi>Wapping,</hi> at the sign of the <hi>Blew-Anchor</hi> in <hi>Wapping</hi>-Dock. Says Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi>; if I come not at Ten of the Clock do not look for me. Says he, can you get no men that are fit to make Commanders of Ships? says I, I have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with any, I do not know but Two or Three: but says I, I will see what I can do. I waited for Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> and Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> next day (both were to come.) The next day I asked him, what he intended by the Commanders of the Ships? where would he have those Ships? He answered some of the Kings Men of War that lay at <hi>Deptford</hi> and <hi>Woolwich</hi> to make Guard Ships. Says I, what will you do if you have no Powder and Shot? if you could take the <hi>Tower,</hi> then you might provide them with every thing fitting. Says Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> we must secure the <hi>Tower</hi> and <hi>Whitehall</hi> both, or we can do nothing. Says I Mr. <hi>Rouse,</hi> where is your Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> then that is to the King? says he we will secure the King that he shall come to no damage, and he shall remain King still.

Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> made answer he did forsee it would be a very short Sessions. Says he, these frequent Prorogations and Dissolutions of the Parliament wont avail him, for what ever the King has, the Parliament gave him, and they may <hi>take it away,</hi> when they please. One bid him have a care what he said, and he replyed, <hi>the King had forfeited his Crown, and had no more right to it than he had.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, I stand here for my Life; it never entred into my heart, nor came out of my mouth, but he came to me several times about it, and I opposed it. At last he dogg'd me so often, that he gave me occasion to ask him the meaning of it. The first place I saw him in was the <hi>Kings-Head</hi> (as he saith truly) in <hi>Swithins</hi> Alley. There were several persons (as they met there every day upon their private occasions) that is true. He asked me a strange question, (that was the first time I heard of it) whether I was willing to oppose a Foreign Invasion that was like to be made speedily? and whether I would ingage in the Defence of it? And this he did Two or Three times afterwards. To which I rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yed, Sir, I and every honest man are bound (as we are Subjects, and have taken the Oaths of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi>) to ingage in such a thing you put me upon, that was to ingage against a foreign Invasion. The next time, he as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed me how far I would assist if such a thing should fall out as a foreign Invasion? I wondered to hear it so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; I answered, I never had but one Sword for several years, though I have had occasion for many in other Countries, but I make no question but by the assistance of my friends, <hi>to Raise an Hundred Arms,</hi> that was my very expression. But withal I demanded what he meant by Invasion, and that I insisted upon several times; for, says I, I know of none, and I hope there is none li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to be. I took an accompt of this in Characters, and have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his Majesty and the Council with it. He replyed to me, says he, I wonder you are a stranger to such a thing, 'Tis true says he, that is the <hi>word</hi> goes up and down, but says he there is another kind of Invasion meant by some men. I asked him what other <hi>Invasion</hi> do you mean? he answered presently, don't you know? are you a stranger in <hi>England</hi>? In <hi>Israel</hi>? says he there is an Invasion upon our <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>liberties</hi> and <hi>all we have</hi>: Whereupon I was a little startled. This was at the <hi>Kings-Head</hi> Tavern. Another time I desired him to explain his meaning, being a stranger to it, when I exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>essed my readiness to serve the King upon such an occasion in those words; they that know me, know that I am not in the capacity of raising an Hundred Arms, but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it as God knows in opposition to a Foreign Invasion. But I thank God I took Characters day by day, and with a resolution day by day to discover it, but he has got the start of me, for fear I would swear against him. He insisted still upon it that our Rights and liberties were Invaded, and that was the Invasion all along intended, and that was the way to hook in persons only upon that pretence of a Foreign Invasion. I asked him in <hi>what manner</hi> he meant Invasion? says he, what with their Doctrines on one hand, and <hi>oppression</hi> on the other, they lye so heavy that we <hi>can't bear it no longer.</hi> Says I, what do you mean by this? what course do you think of? what can you propound to your self to extricate your self out of these troubles you so much complain of? To which he answered, you are a stranger to what is a foot and hath been a foot a great while. Do you not know the persons that are ingaged in the design? (I was a little inquisitive to know what was meant by the persons.) No (says I) positively, I know not what you mean, I am a perfect stranger to these persons and this design, and I wished him and all others (as they were men and Christians) that they would take care of <hi>opposing the Government they lived under,</hi> that was my very words. Says he, that we have considered very well, and how to secure the <hi>two things,</hi> and says he you shall see we will do it dexterously, without shedding a drop of blood, nay, says he, not the blood of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> though he be the veriest dog in <hi>England.</hi> I desired him to explain himself, he answered, The mischief of it is we can't agree among our selves, for it was <hi>Vs</hi> and <hi>We</hi> at every word; so I concluded he was of the Cabal and Clubb that met together on this design (that hath come before your Lordship;) and I am pretty confident there was such a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

story you come to me about one day after another. With much ado, he told me Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough</hi> was one. After this discourse I never saw Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> but twice, once was at the <hi>King's-head</hi> Tavern, where I believe was Twenty; the second time was a day or two after I saw the Proclamation and his Name in it. So much I speak of Mr. <hi>Goodenough.</hi> I asked him the Names of the other persons that were ingaged in this Design, and (says he) I must conceal them, for I am under an obligation; but the first time I saw the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against Col. <hi>Rumsey,</hi> and the others, says he, I was deadly afraid I was in the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; but (says he) all these persons are concerned and several others. Thereupon he told me, that when they met they came to this Resolution, of seizing the Tower, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, and taking of <hi>London.</hi> Says I, pray what money have you to carry on this?

                  <p>My Lord, Though this thing be revived, which was out of doors two years since, and I suppose it is well known to your Lordship, who was then upon the Bench. As I was told, there was a word in the Indictment called <hi>Colloquium</hi>: He was asked what Discourse passed before? But if Mr. <hi>Corbin</hi> would remember himself, I do confess I did say these words; but the words that followed, before.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wyat</hi> was urging of several Discourses, the Popish Grandeur in deposing Kings, and I gave this Answer in these words: <hi>Sir,</hi> (says I) <hi>If it were in the power of any Pope to depose the King, then he might as well take away the Crown off the King's Head; but he hath no such Power; if he had that Power,</hi> says I, <hi>then the Crown of</hi> England <hi>is yours as much as his.</hi>

                  <p>Look you Gentlemen of the <hi>Jury.</hi> You hear that this person at the Bar is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for High. Treason in conspiring the Kings death, and declaring this by over Acts, that is endeavouring to raise Men here for to Seize the <hi>Tower</hi> and to make an Insurrection here, and a Rebellion within the Kingdom: You hear two positive Witnesses of what they have heard from him; He did endeavour says <hi>Lee</hi> to bring him into it, and he told him the whole design, he did declare to him the manner how they intended to Seize the King and the Duke of <hi>York</hi>; Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> was one of the persons that confederated with him, one of them, but several others they had. They had covert Terms to disguise this, by getting the Country People in their Harvest. He told them of a design he had to get the Seamen a Thousand of them together to Seize the <hi>Tower</hi> and <hi>White-Hall</hi> both at a time. And you hear that Mate <hi>Lee</hi> had the same discourse in substance with him of endeavouring to Seize the <hi>Tower</hi> and get Arms, for to Seize the Kings Ships, to raise a Thousand persons for the effecting of this; All these things you have heard proved against him, he gives no Answer to any of them, but only tells you that in truth he did not say these things to them. but they, that is the first <hi>Lee</hi> said these things to him. He hath no evidence at all of it. You hear likewise (which does agree with this case) the Testimony by the other person concerning his discourse in 81. How he said the King had forfeited his Crown and had no right to it, but the Parliament gave him his Authority and might take it away. All these discourses they savour of a very wicked Spirit as can be in the whole World. I must leave it to you whether you believe him Guilty.</p>

                  <hi>The Jury presently gave their Verdict that he was Guilty.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, we shall not need to trouble you much with the Prisoner at the Bar, for this Prisoner with him that went before were to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that part of this horrid Conspiracy relating to the seizing the <hi>Tower,</hi> because the same Witnesses that were against the former, are against the Prisoner at the Bar. We shall not need to trouble you with the history, we will call our Witnesses to prove it.— Do you hear, <hi>Lee,</hi> you must tell my Lord and the Jury what the Prisoner at the Bar was concerned in.</p>

                  <p>I will acquaint your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury, that Capt. <hi>Blague,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> were frequently at the Tavern. I presume many times they came in about Business, and sometimes there was Discourses to carry on this Conspiracy. Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> told me he had acquainted Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> with it, about getting Ten Sea Captains; Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> told him they had better engage one or two Ships to shoot Morter-pieces into the <hi>Tower,</hi> which would presently destroy it, and discoursing with Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> about the affair, he told me he would be ready, in a Fortnight or Three Weeks.</p>

                  <p>Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> told me he would be ready in a Fortnight or something more, and he had an intention to lay in about Fourteen Guns in his own Ship that he had bought, he would have Twenty four in it, and lay it on <hi>Southwarke</hi> side against the <hi>Tower.</hi> He would venture his Ship, but they must see they were provided with Money for the Seamen. I acquainted Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> with this, and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> desired to speak with Capt. <hi>Blague,</hi> I told Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> of it, and we took Coach at the <hi>Stocks</hi>-Market, and went to the <hi>Kings-head</hi> in <hi>Chancery-Lane,</hi> where we met with Mr. <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Francis Goodenough,</hi> Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> asked what Money they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, they said about 40000 <hi>l.</hi> says Capt. <hi>Blague,</hi> the Seamen will swallow that up imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:93094:38"/>
he then told them again, the only way was to do it with Morter-pieces, that he would venture his own Ship and provide Two hundred men.</p>

                  <p>He asked what Money was provided, he said there was about 40000 <hi>l.</hi> then, he said that would be easily swallowed, Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> said that there would be more provided at any time. Cap. <hi>Blague</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> both of them, drank a Glass or two of Wine together, and so at that time we parted. I met with Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> again, and bid me for God's sake, don't discourse before my Mate such a one, but my Mate <hi>Lee</hi> is a very honest fellow: Said he, I will undertake once in Twenty times to dismount them Six Guns that face towards <hi>Surrey</hi> side, which I understood to be about <hi>Traytor</hi>'s-Bridge, he would undertake to dismount them. What discourse Capt. <hi>Blague,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> had a part I can't tell, but Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> told me, he would get some other Captains to engage in that affair. That Business was left to him and I, and I was desired to be frequently with Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> for the managing this affair of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and saies he, I have had a Commission, though not in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by Land as well as by Sea.</p>

                  <p>My Business was with Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> to be his Mate, and I was conversant with him at the <hi>Exchange,</hi> the Coffee-house and the <hi>Kings-head</hi> Tavern. And we had discourse about these things.</p>

                  <p>Come Capt. <hi>Blague,</hi> would you have him asked any Question?</p>

                  <p>My Lord, otherwise I had gone to Sea soon after I came home, but so it was, that I had an occasion for <hi>Pensilvania,</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> and coming one day to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> I met Mr. <hi>Rouse,</hi> whom I had not seen in 16 or 17 years before, for Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> made a Voyage to <hi>Virginia</hi> with me about 20 years ago. Now, My Lord, meeting with Mr. <hi>Rouse,</hi> I had an occasion then to take up Two' or Three Hundred Pounds, and knowing Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> was a Broker, I did imploy him to procure it me, but he did not; however daily I came to him to dispatch that affair, and Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> being a Man for a Tavern, I went to the <hi>Kings-head</hi> Tavern, and the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern, if he was not at one place I found him at another, in order to perfect this business. So, My Lord, when I came into his Company, several People use to be with him that I never saw in my life, and Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> would say sit down a little and I will go with you presently, so I would sit down and drink a Glass of Wine, and go to the places where the affair was to be managed, after I had done thus several days and to no purpose, I did it my self. Now, My Lord, Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> in that time brought me acquainted with <hi>Goodenough,</hi> because <hi>Goodenough</hi> was in his Company and Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> not that I ever saw Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> in my life before, and not as Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> says that I ever was with him at the <hi>Dragon.</hi>

                  <p>I was just coming home when Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> was going to meet with Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough,</hi> and I went in there and took a Glass of Wine and bid them farwel, and so went home. When I was with Mr. <hi>Rouse,</hi> I was asking what People they were that were in his Company, he said very honest Men, drank a Glass of Wine and went away, and still I found them together. I was saying to this Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> here, if you will go along with me, you shall give me as much for your Passage as any of the rest of the Passengers do. Now at this time my Ship was not in my possession, this very day three Weeks I had it in my possession, and now at this very day she is in the Carpenters hands, who is here now I suppose.</p>

                  <p>Now Sir, whereas Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> reports that I discourst with Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> concerning any publick affairs, or any thing tending to the Disturbance of the Peace, then am I not a Christian. Besides Sir, I did not speak Twenty words, or Ten words at the time but your Servant Sir, or here's to You in a Glass of Wine; and this I do speak in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God Almighty. And when I came into a Room, I never staid longer than Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> for my business was with him, and so went about my own affairs. As for Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough,</hi> I believe I was three times in his Company before I could remember his name, I would ask <hi>Rouse</hi> several times what do you call that Man. But in reference to the <hi>Tower</hi> that Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> speaks of, that must be touched at; I do remember very well, I shall by no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ans palliate it if I were presently to die, coming up from the Ship we were coming by water, indeed I should have had possession of the Ship a Fortnight before, if they had done me Justice, I had Two or Three Hundred Pounds for them before, but coming from the Ship, we were coming up by water by the <hi>Tower,</hi> I don't know how it was, I spake it to the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, this place is not well Fortified, and if any occasion should happen this place lies in more peril and jeopardy than any place of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and so it does. It is an ease mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for any to give their Sentiments whether they be accepted of or no. This is the very thing I said, and then they were talking of a <hi>French</hi> War and the like. Then I said you silly fools, if they should take it, it is but going over a t'other side and throwing half a dozen Bombo's to them and set them out again. But however, Mate <hi>Lee,</hi> if he remember I told him the same thing at that same time, and I told Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> it was pitty a thousand times, that place was not better Fortified. But as to what Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> says, to have Two hundred men in a poor Pink, I have refused several in that very Ship, because I could not stow an Hundred Men, Women, and Children, and that I should Press Two hundred Men in that Ship, that will not hold. And besides it is a Pink, let any one look upon her and see, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Ship be fit or no to take in Two hundred Men. But whereas they say I had Arms and such things, I bought the Ship and Arms together, I had 4 Blunderbusses, 2 Javelins and Half-Pikes, that is all.</p>

And says he, when I have done the business, I have been a Captain ashore in another Country, I have been in Commission in another Country ashore, and can tell how to mannage Men ashore as well as aboard. Another thing was, after all this some time, when I understood I was Sworn against, I was indeed, the Captain says right, to have gone with him a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, and was with him several times, I gave him a report how the <hi>Tower</hi> might be taken by Ladders and Granadoes, and he told me that <hi>Nelthrop</hi>'s Brother came to see him, and did inform me that neither <hi>Mr. Goodenough</hi> nor his Brother was taken, and that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was in the Country and quickly would come.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> spoke to me of getting some Seamen, that might be fit to make Masters of Ships, and I asked him what he would do with those Seamen to make Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Ships, he said, to put them aboard the Kings men of War, and make Guard Ships of them; I said, what can you do with them to make Guard Ships, when there is neither Powder, Shot, nor Ammunition, but said I, if you can take the <hi>Tower</hi> you may do well enough: So that our discourse was about taking the <hi>Tower.</hi>

                  <p>This was our common discourse, I suppose the instigation might be by Mr. <hi>Rouse.</hi> I was acquainted with Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> by going with Capt. <hi>Blague</hi>; this was my first discourse with <hi>Mr. Rouse</hi> and <hi>Mr. Lee</hi> together.</p>

                  <p>There was only <hi>Mr. Rouse</hi> and <hi>Mr. Lee,</hi> I can be positive that Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> was not, but this Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> did say when I gave my way of taking the <hi>Tower</hi> by scaling Ladders, and hand Granadoes, no, says Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> it is a better way to have Mortar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Pieces over the Water, and shoot into the <hi>Tower.</hi>

                  <p>I understood nothing of it but what we discourst together, for I was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with none of the Cabal but <hi>Mr. Rouse</hi> and <hi>Mr. Lee.</hi>

                  <p>The story of <hi>Blackheath</hi> I acquainted you with it about <hi>Mr. Rouse.</hi> There was a Golden Ball to be plaid upon <hi>Black-heath,</hi> a Thousand Seamen to be at the playing of this Ball, Ten Sea Captains to manage these Thousand Seamen, and after the Play was over, every Captain to take his Division apart, and treat them with Punch, and after that was done, to tell them they had other work to do, and to have Long-boats and Arms ready, to go and seize the <hi>Tower.</hi>

                  <p>Look you, Gentlemen, you that are of this <hi>Jury,</hi> this Gentleman is indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for conspiring the Death of the King, and doing some Acts in order to it, that is, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to surprize the Tower, and raising of men, and preparing of Shipping and Guns, and this on purpose to surprize the Tower. That there was an evil Design, a very wicked notorious Design of Siezing the Kings person, and killing the King, that is most certain, you have heard it by a great many witnesses, and it is a thing I think not to be doubted of by any. The question is, Whether this man be guilty of it, and hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken any thing in relation to it. Look you, you ought to have in such cases of high Treason, as you have been told, you ought to have two Witnesses against a person. Here is two Witnesses produced, one of them does speak very shrewdly to the case, and tells you he had it from this person himself, that he had spoken with <hi>Goodenough</hi> about this matter, about surprizing the Tower, and that he told him it was an easie thing to surprize the Tower, and that he could do it, that he had a Ship ready, and he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that 200 men should be ready, with Morter-Pieces from <hi>Southwark</hi>-side to throw them and beat down the Tower, so that it might have presently been down. First, Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> doth say, that the Captain there at the Bar, that he was oftentimes with Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rouse,</hi> and others, who it is plain were in that Design, both <hi>Rouse</hi> and <hi>Goodenough</hi> was, and that he heard <hi>Goodenough</hi> say that the Captain had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it, and he says that the Captain had Discourse with <hi>Goodenough</hi> about it. He says, the Captain asked him in order to this, what money could be raised, and he told him there was 40000.1. and the Captain told him that was but a small matter, the Seamen would eat up that; and <hi>Goodenough</hi> told him there was a greater Bank in <hi>Holland,</hi> that would be brought over. So that this Evidence goes a great way. But then, Gentlemen, you must consider whether you have another Evidence or not. There is a person that you call <hi>Mate,</hi> the <hi>Mate</hi> doth give a dark kind of an Evidence, he does say here that he and the Captain had discourse about the way of taking the Tower, and he believes it was in order to take the Tower, but he does say when he heard it no Body was present but himself, and he was of one opinion how the Tower might be taken, that is, by scaling Ladders and hand Granadoes, and that the Captain was of another opinion, whether it might not be better taken by Morter-Pieces thrown from <hi>Southwark</hi>-side, but whether the Captain had any notice of this design of taking it, he cannot tell, or whether he had any acquaintance concerning it. So that his Evidence does seem to be somewhat dark. Whether this were sportive, or a trial of their skill, or whether it was a design to have Counsel and Advice one of another, which way to take it, I must leave it to you, whether it was done with an intent and design, for to find out the best way in order to the taking of it. But if it were only a Discourse at large between them, an endeavour to try their Judgments one with another, and speaking their minds one with another in that case, then this evidence doth not come home to make him guilty of the Plot of taking the Tower or taking away the Kings life. He tells you he did speak of a Ball to be thrown up, but whether he ever heard of the other design that <hi>Lee</hi> speaks of the first <hi>Lee, Thomas Lee,</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:93094:42"/>
of throwing up a Ball by Seamen in order to the taking of the Tower, he knows not. <hi>Lee</hi> says, the first Witness, he does not know any thing whether this man at the Barr was ever acquainted with the Ball or not. If upon what you have heard you believe that there are two Witnesses to prove this Gentleman at the Barr Guilty of this Design, of Surprizing the Tower, and Killing the King, and taking the Tower in order to it in this manner; then you ought to find him Guilty: but if you have not two Witnesses that do testifie the thing, then Gentlemen, under two Witnesses a man cannot be Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Russel.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Mr. Recorder, If all that the Witnesses swore against me be true, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you and the Court, I appeal to you whether I am guilty within the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. they having sworn a Conspiracy to levy War; but no Intention of killing the King: And therefore I think truely Judgment ought not to pass upon me for Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the death of the King, of which there was no proof by any one Witness.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, that was an Exception proper (and as I think you did make it) before the Verdict; whether the Evidence does amount to prove the Charge, that is proper to be observed to the Jury; for if the Evidence come short of the Indictment, they can't find it to be a true Charge: But when the Jury has found it, their Verdict does pass for truth. We are bound by the Verdict as well as your Lordship, we are to go by what the Jury have found, not their Evidence.</p>

                  <p>I think it very hard I must be Condemned upon a Point that there was not one thing of it sworn, therefore I think I may very Legally demand arrest of Judgment.</p>

                  <p>I hope your Lordship will consider 'tis not the Court can give a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, it must be the Jury.

Condition will be proportionable. My Lord, it is the Duty of the Witnesses to give Evidence according to truth, it is the Duty of the Jury to proceed according to Evidence, and 'tis the duty of the Court to give Judgment according to the Verdict. It is the Kings pleasure signified by his Attorney General, to demand Judgment against your Lordship according to this Verdict, and therefore my Lord I shall not delay it with any further circumlocution. The Judgment the Law hath provided, and is the Duty of the Court to give, is,
<q>
                        <hi>That you be carried back again, to the place from whence you came, and from thence, be drawn upon an hurdle to the place of Execution; where you shall be hanged up by the Neck, but cut down alive, your Entrails and Privy-Members cut from your Body, and burnt in your sight, your Head to be severed from your Body, and your Body Divided into four Parts, and disposed at the Kings pleasure.

                  <speaker>Capt. <hi>Walcott.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I would beg the favour that the Youth my Son might come and see me, and some of my Friends.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Recorder.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Capt. <hi>Richardson</hi> does not deny it to any man after he is condemned, that is a piece of Humanity you need not ask, I never knew it denyed.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> Hone <hi>was asked what he could say against Judgment.</hi>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Ay, Ay, God forbid. You had best ask for some Divine to come to you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> Rouse <hi>was asked the same Question.</hi>

                  <speaker>Rouse.</speaker>
                  <p>I would speak of the disadvantages I had when I came upon my Tryal. When I was put upon my Tryal you know very well, I begged the favour of some things; one was a Copy of the Indictment, when I saw a person come before me, who in his own Conscience knew was the Author of all these things, I have nothing to say against the Judgment or Verdict, I always had a great Veneration for the Constitutions of the Kingdom, I pray God forgive them that came against me. I wish I had no more weight upon my Legs then I have in my own Conscience. I prayed a Copy of my Indictment. These things unexpectedly came upon my Tryal, that I had not opportunity to speak what I should.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>We are content to hear you. But observe, you are to answer the Question that is asked. Why Judgment should not pass upon you. You say you won't speak against the Jury, we must not hear you, nor against the Verdict.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rouse.</speaker>
                  <p>I have one word more, and that is, the Vast difference between the Indictment and their Oaths; the Indictment was, that such and such words, and discourses, passed the Second of <hi>March</hi>; the Oaths sworn were, that the words were not spoken then, but the last of <hi>June,</hi> which was three months difference, but however the <hi>Jury</hi> have pleased to find it. I must throw my self at his Majesties feet, I have nothing more to say.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then silence was proclaim'd and Judgement given against</hi> Walcott, Hone, <hi>and</hi> Rouse, <hi>in like manner as upon the L.</hi> Russel.</p>
