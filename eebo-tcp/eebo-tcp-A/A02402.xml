            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath ben reported for truth a long time, that the Duke and State of Wittenberge had gotten a fellowe for the nones, ſo excellent an Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, as the wide world had not his like, The knowledge of the Philoſophers ſtone was his as ſure as euer it was Salomons. Oh hee was a perrillous fellowe by report, hee enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to paue Wittenberg with ſiluer, and couer the houſes with gold. As for the Indies and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements gotten with ſo long trauaile, ſo daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fightes, &amp; ſuch like attempes, he held them in ſcorne, the Elixer of life was his, and thereon hee would venter his life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27753:8"/>NOw ſir hee was not a thinne, peaking beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly Alchimiſt, futeleſſe, bloodleſſe, freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, none of them that had ſmokt out their eies with tumentations, nor wrinckled their checkes like a dried Neates tongue, with the ill ſpeede and long practiſe of their ſure looſing ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: But this was a ioly fat faced Gentleman, nay by your leaue a Nobleman hee would needes bee, and lord of Brunholfe, his appartell couered with gold, at his haire and eares gold hung care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely dangling, chaines, carkanets, bracelets, garters, hatband, all true gold, ſo that hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med another Plutus, that god of mettals whom the Poetes faine ſo many rich fables of. To make ſhort, ſo this gallant crept in credit with the duke and State, that hee was employed at their charge about his rare practiſe, a multitude of expences they were at, and ſtill ſtill ſome croſſe chaunce happened that hindered the going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this golden bleſſing. At laſt perceiuing themſelues to bee palpably abuſed, they grewe round with this ſquaring gallant: telling him that they would puniſh his deceit, if hee did not ſpeedily performe his promiſe. My young maiſter hauing good hope to giue them the ſlip, (as all ſuch ſlippery Gentlemen of his vnſtayed faculty ſtriue to doe) ſet them a day when they ſhould ſee the admired experiment hee had promiſed, or if hee failed hee offered his life in ſatiſfaction. The daie came, but no Philoſophers ſtone was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to turne all things to gold, as <hi>Midas</hi> did by touching:

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27753:9"/>Therefore the State adding more to their loſſe prepared a gallowes of a quadrangle forme moſt artificially wrought, being yron worke gilt euer, with bowles on the top and other curious forge worke. It was plated on a ſquare of ſtone, and from the top in the middle of the quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle went vp an vpright barre of yron and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther croſſing yet in manner of a gibbet, this held a broad Vane, vpon which was ingrauen theſe wordes.</p>
            <q>Here hangeth the crafty Alchimiſt that ſcaped from Struckgart, who pretended to make gold of yron, and becauſe hee lied and did deceiue, he is hanged on yron gilded.</q>
            <p>The daie of his death was on Aprill the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day 1597, hee was brought to the gallowes with a hundred and foureſcore horſemen, and a multitude of footemen, penitent hee was, and did confeſſe his errour, yet a little bragged of his art.</p>
            <p>ANd by the way (<hi>M Harc.</hi>) I here note, all of his kinde, haue that kinde of fault how euer they be ouertaken, yet they haue a mad deſperate hope to attaine that in one houre that thouſandes of them could neuer meete with in an age. You know ſome about London, that ſhall bee name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, who ſtill lacke purging in the maiſter veyne, againſt this mad frenzy of Alchimiſt, and wil take
<pb facs="tcp:27753:10"/>
no warning by the daily iſſue that runneth and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poureth from their friendes cofres and their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances.</p>
            <p>But leauing them to beweepe their owne loſſe, returne we to <hi>Iohn Honauer,</hi> by himſelfe named lord of Brunholfe, a captiue captaine in that beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly beguiling art. He was ſuted in cloth of gold, his ſtockings ſilke, his hat thrumd with gold and ſilke, his band of gold about his necke, a chaine of gold and in this habite he was hanged dead, on a barre of yron croſſing from the Vane, like the croſſe poſt of a gibbet: being dead he was diſrobed, the hang man ſeazing on his gallant ſute, and in foure gilt yron chaines, his bodie was hung vp.</p>
            <p>On a piller by the gallowes was his liuely pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with verſes of high Dutch written to this effect.</p>

               <l>The Duke of Wittenberg commanded</l>
               <l>At Struckgart he ſhould be impriſoned</l>
               <l>But thence he ſcaped to his great coſt</l>
               <l>For by his flight his life he loſt,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:27753:10"/>Condemn'd he was hanged to bee,</l>

               <l>He coſt the State two tunne of gold</l>
               <l>And by his craft his life was ſold</l>
               <l>Three hundred pounds they more beſtow</l>
               <l>To hang him with a golden ſhow</l>
               <l>So ended he before he wiſt</l>
               <l>Becauſe he was an Alchimiſt.</l>

            <p>Theſe rimes I can no better tranſlate, the ſence I am ſure they hold. Hee was brought to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a hundred and foureſcore horſe, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of other people crying, There goes to hang the Algomiſt: which is a by-name they giue Alchimiſts in this countrey.
