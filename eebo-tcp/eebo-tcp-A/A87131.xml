            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THe preſent caſe conſidered, I need ſay no more, then, If there be no Bar, a Parliament may conſiſt wholly, or in the greater part, of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians or Royaliſts; and if there be a Bar, it is no Government by Parliaments, but by the Bar that is upon them; which muſt be of greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But the Houſe of Commons, as hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto uſual in <hi>England,</hi> conſiſted of about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Deputies of the People, for the moſt part Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and old Stagers, elected again and again unto the ſame imployment, without vacation; this is that which being ſweet in the ſtomack of divers, is the old love for which they deteſt new forms. Such an Aſſembly, for the number and nature of their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is ſomewhat too low and too large to come up unto the true intereſt of a King, and too high and too narrow to deſcend wholly unto the true intereſt of the People; they have antiently provided diligently that they might hawk and hunt without impediment of the King, and of the lower ſort, to whom it was almoſt capital to ſpoil their game: and though this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114996:3"/>
may ſeem but a jeſting inſtance, yet have the reſt of their Laws, for their pitch, been much of the middle way, or of the like Genius, while they were under a Nobility; but ſince, through the natural decay of that order, they came to a greater height, it hath been to endure no check. Wherefore, as it hath been found under a King, that ſuch an Aſſembly will endure no King, through the check they apprehend from him: ſo it will be found that under a Commonwealth they will be addicted unto the introduction of Monarchy, through the check they apprehend from the people.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that an alteration of Government going no farther then the inſtitution of Parliaments, and a Council in the Intervals, can come to no more then that, ſo often as the Council ſhall be changed for a King, or the King for a Council, ſo often the Commonwealth (if this deſerve any ſuch name) muſt be changed into Monarchy, and the Monarchy into a Commonwealth; which changes may be made with ſuch eaſe and ſuddenneſs, that every night it may be a caſt of a Dye, what the Government ſhall be the next morning. Where the alteration (I ſay) of the Government is no greater then from a Kings Chair, to a narrow Bench of Counſellours; there goeth no more to make a Single Perſon, then throwing down the Bench, and ſetting up the Chair; nor to make a Commonwealth (ſuch an one as it is) then throwing down the Chair, and ſetttng up the Bench. But for the farther diſcovery of ſuch Cauſes, as in ſo ſtrange and unheard-of innovation may give fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent or continual mutations, if this poſture of things be upheld (as I cannot ſee how otherwiſe it ſhould ſtand) by an Army, Let us conſider three things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:114996:3"/>
Firſt, What is incident unto ſuch an Army.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What is incident unto ſuch a Council.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, What is incident unto ſuch a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It is incident unto ſuch an Army, let the body thereof be never ſo popularly affected, to be under a Monarchical Adminiſtration, or to be top-heavy in their great Officers, which will have power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no, to overſway both the Army and the Government; as in the ſetting up of the late Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon: Again, if the body of the Army muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt the Government, neither their great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, nor any thing elſe in the Parliament or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, can withſtand them; as in the pulling down of the latter Single Perſon: whence it is evident that ſuch an Army can be no foundation of any Settlement.</p>
            <p>A Council in the Intervals, though it ſhould rule well, will yet have a tendency toward preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or prolongation of it ſelf; and if it rule ill, will be obnoxious unto Parliaments: for which cauſe, what help for themſelves ſhall be in their power, is to be preſumed, will be in their will: and they have the ſame power which the King had, or which is all one, are in as effectual a poſture to obſtruct or elude the meeting of Parliaments; therefore it will be in their will to do it: and if they will this, they reduce the Government into Oligarchy, then into Faction, and laſt of all, into Confuſion.</p>
            <p>The people this while muſt unavoydably perceive this Council to conſiſt of too few to be Fellows, and of too many to be Maſters: for which cauſe, being all broken into Faction, ſome for a Commonwealth, and ſome for Monarchy, Parliaments coming by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114996:4"/>
guſts, whether with or againſt the will of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, will either be torn with like Faction among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or pull down the Council as no Government, and endeavour ſome Settlement. Now if a Monarchy (as moſt likely, becauſe moſt obvious) be ſet up, it can be no ſettlement, becauſe it is quite contrary unto the Balance of the Nation; and ſo they mend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but make greater confuſion: and a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth or Democracy conſiſteth of ſuch Orders &amp; ſuch Novelties in this Land, as will never be light upon by an Aſſembly, nor credited by ſuch as are unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Art: ſo that this Nation going thus far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, will come but unto that very point, where it now ſtands at gaze, or to far greater confuſion; for which there is no Remedy, ſave onely that they who are in power would lay aſide all prejudice unto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Novelties and innovations, or rather, not give themſelves unto ſuch Novelties as tend unto confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (for ſuch have been the late changes) but conſider ſuch Antiquities as have been, and muſt be the Rule and Reaſon of a wiſe proceeding in that, which by the Providence of God never was before, and yet is now come to be the truth of their Caſe.</p>
            <p>But if what hath been hitherto ſhewn, be the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſequence of Parliaments with a Council in the Intervals, as that it will be no ſetlement, but a State now ſetting up, then pulling down Kings, or ſingle Perſons; it is apparent that what introduceth Monarchy, introduceth ſuppreſſion of civil Liberty, and in that, of Liberty of Conſcience. Wherefore certain it is, that the Spirit of a Parliament with a Council in the Intervals, is not to be truſted, leſt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Monarchy and ſuppreſſion of Liberty; and in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114996:4"/>
that, of the Liberty of Conſcience: nor the ſpirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Form whatſoever, but that onely of a Democracy or Free State, which is the ſame that through Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties introduced by God himſelf, is onely practicable as a ſettlement in the preſent caſe of this diſtracted Nation.</p>
            <p>The true Form of a Democracy or Free State con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth eſpecially in this, That as to Law-giving, the wiſdom of the Nation propoſe, and the intereſt of the Nation reſolve. If this be poſſible in <hi>England,</hi> then is it impoſſible, that there ſhould be in <hi>England</hi> greater ſecurity unto Liberty, whether Civil or of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which but for a new diſtinction is the ſame. Now that it is poſſible and eaſily practicable to frame ſuch ſtanding Aſſemblies in <hi>England,</hi> whereof the one ſhall contain the Wiſdom, the other the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the whole Nation, hath been long ſince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</p>
            <p>But men that go upon picking up Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Houſe out of the rubbiſh, and diſtinguiſh not between the people under the ruines of the Old Government, and what they muſt needs be when rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the proper ſtructure of a New Frame, will ſay, That the people have a general averſion from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built up into any New Form at all. So hath the Rubbiſh, and yet it may have good ſtones and beams in it. They will ſay, that there is a general diſ-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nay hatred, thorowout the Counties, unto the Government; and that more now, then in the time of the late Uſurper. Which I eaſily believe, becauſe the change of a Perſon, with what loſs ſoever, is yet a leſs Change then the change of a Government: the former is a change from a thing that was known, to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114996:5"/>
another that is known; but the later muſt be a change from a thing that hath been known in this Nation, to a thing that was never known in this Nation. A man that walketh, treadeth with almoſt equal bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his next ſtep, if he ſee it, though it be in the dirt: but let it be never ſo fair, if he ſee it not, he ſtands ſtock-ſtill. This is the preſent ſtate of the people, and this effect in the People is eſpecially occaſioned by their natural diſtruſt of ſuch Novelties as they cannot penetrate or diſcover what they are. Nor is it an ill Pulſe, the caſe conſidered, in which it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no other then their conſtancie and dear affection unto their Old Laws and ways, how unfit ſoever they be now become. Wherefore, ſo ſoon as you have fitted them better, none of this will be againſt you, but all for you. It is certain, that a people under proper Orders, is the leaſt Effeminate, and moſt Manly Government in the world. But ſuch an one as hath no experience or knowledge in theſe, hath a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, that is altogether childiſh: what they finde uneaſie, they tear off, and throw away; as in the late War: but no ſooner finde the nakedneſs unto which by like means they are brought, then being unable to cloath themſelves, they fall into an unmanly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and betake themſelves unto picking up of their Old Trappings. If there be not men at the head of them, who by introduction of a proper Form, can cloath their nakedneſs, and reduce their paſſion unto temper, there is nothing to be expected, but darkneſs, deſolation and horrour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now if you be Saints,</hi> do good unto them that hate you, and would perſecute you. <hi>Now</hi> cast your bread upon the waters, and after many days, <hi>nay after a few days,</hi> you ſhall finde it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114996:5"/>
That the People of this Land have an averſion from Novelties or Innovations, that they are incapable of diſcourſe or reaſoning upon Government, that they do not underſtand the true form of a Free and Equal Commonwealth, is no impediment unto them, nor excuſe unto wiſe and honeſt men, why they ſhould not be imbarqued.</p>
            <p>As the Soul of Man being by the Wiſdom of God imbarqued in Fleſh, doth all the Functions of the Body, not that ſhe underſtandeth it, but that ſhe can work no otherwiſe; ſo the Body of a People, by the wiſdom of one Man, (if there be any ſuch Man, as having ſuch power, can be ſo honeſt) or of a few Men (if there be any ſo few, as having ſuch power, can agree in ſuch a matter) imbarqued in the true Form of a Government, do all the Functions of the ſame, not that they underſtand it; for how much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood they the late Monarchy, when it was in the greateſt vigour? but that through the neceſſity of the form, except it come to be inſufficient (as through the late decay of the Church and the Nobility) they can work no otherwiſe then according unto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it.</p>
            <p>If the Form thus introduced be that of a Free and Equal Commonwealth, the People not being able to work otherwiſe then according unto the nature of it, can never introduce Monarchy, nor perſecution for Conſcience, becauſe either of theſe is contrary and deſtructive unto the nature of the Form.</p>
            <p>That the former is ſo, I need not prove; and that the latter is ſo, is obvious: for without invading Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Liberty, there is no invaſion of the Liberty of Conſcience; and by invading Civil Liberty, this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114996:6"/>
Form is diſſolved. But ſome will ſay, Thruſt the People into Innovations unto which they have ſo great averſion? before they can be brought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, and againſt their conſent? what a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Freedom! what a Difficulty! what an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice!</p>
            <p>But taking all this together; what leſs can be ſaid to whatever the Parliament ſhall next introduce? Or if you take them apart.</p>
            <p>As to averſion, I have already ſpoken; it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny malice in the People, but their nature in this caſe, which being through meer want of acquaintance with ſuch things as they can no wiſe underſtand but by Tryal, is not to be rectified but by the introduction of ſuch a Form as they finding far more worthy of their holding, will by changing of the hand, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their more deſerved conſtancy.</p>
            <p>As to the difficulty of introducing a new Form, of obtaining the Peoples conſent, and the violation that in faylure of the ſame may be made upon Liberty, I ſay, that Elections, at divers times, have already been divers; that in this there hath been no violation of Liberty, nor difficulty in obtaining the peoples conſent: and ſuch Elections as will neceſſarily intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Form of a new Commonwealth, have no ſuch difference in them from the former, that they ſhould not be as eaſily conſented unto, and performed by the people; and this done by ordaining the cauſe, they have ordained the effect, and ſo introduced the new form by common and univerſal conſent.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If it be juſt that the people ſhould have their Liberty, they will ſoon finde by this change, that they both have it, and know how to hold it: which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114996:6"/>
a People once finding, were never willing to part with: and in this conſiſteth the ſtrongeſt ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Monarchy, and for Liberty of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>To conclude: This to our preſent Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-men, is dictated by univerſal experience, and written by the beſt Politians, as their certain Doom.</p>
            <p>If they introduce a well-ordered Commonwealth, they ſhall be ſafe while they live, and famous when they are dead; and if they introduce not a well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Commonwealth, they ſhall be unſafe while they live, and infamous when they are dead.</p>
