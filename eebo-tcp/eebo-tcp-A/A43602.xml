            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

mists of errour being by our bright

expelled, and scattered, I thought it a point
of my duty (worthy Reader) to expand in

being principall vapours that dimm'd both

here defin'd generally and specially: And

loath their condition; for certaine, more
pestilent Vermine they are than Foxes;
not onely content to devoure for satisfaction

            <head>A Projector in generall,</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>S a creature whose <hi>Genus</hi> is
<hi>animal,</hi> and <hi>differencia Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale;</hi>
onely hee is like cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Cain: Ens projectum,</hi> that
is a thing cast off all honest mens so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties:
hee is <hi>quoad</hi> a man <hi>rationalis,</hi>
and <hi>quatenus projector superationalis,</hi> his
fine wit transcending his honest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
and as worke of Supererogation
replenishing him with a main propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to undoe others to enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
He is an Ubiquitary, being at
<pb facs="tcp:53794:6"/>
one time in every place, till all places
be weary of him. A <hi>Centimanus</hi> in his
touch, and an <hi>Argus</hi> in his sight,
though there hee participate of the
<hi>Basiliskes</hi> nature, killing all hee looks
on first. He is the <hi>Egyptian Frog,</hi> that
creeps into every mans dwelling, nay
into his dish, and sometimes into mens
beds, for often he has beene given to
Venerie, and invaded mens wives. To
conclude, he is every thing but what
he should bee, <hi>Honest:</hi> And is the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Generalissimum</hi> of a Knave.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as some of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
affirme, He is a Mongrill by
birth: His Father was an <hi>Hittite,</hi> and
his Mother an <hi>Amorite.</hi> His Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his youth was with a Poet, and
by him infected with strange rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and whimsies, which hee strives
to put in practice, and calls them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
his riper yeares were corrupted
<pb facs="tcp:53794:6"/>
with the abominable termes of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
Lattin, and Pedlers French. His
actions at the first view speake him
honest, and politicke; but the end he
aimes at proves him the cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
way. Hee is in his discourse a
Gymnosophist, by Religion a <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
and in his Faith an Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist.</p>
            <p>He is the winter Fowle that know
their seasons, and you may find as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Projecters in Parliament time, as
Woodcocks in Summer: of all Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
a Baud, a Pimpe, a pander, and
a Projector, hate to be called by their
proper names, although they love
their Trades.</p>
            <p>Hee is one that hath alwayes more
money in his mouth, than in his purse,
and feedes as heartily upon his Aicry
hopes, as the newes Mongers in
<hi>Pauls</hi> upon Duke <hi>Humphreyes</hi> Cates.
<pb facs="tcp:53794:7"/>
Hee is one that is wiser in his owne
conceit than the Privie Councell,
can reforme a Common-wealth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a Parliament: you may read
all the penall Statutes, if his tongue
chance to peepe out of his mouth:
onely he makes a <hi>quaere,</hi> and demurres
upon <hi>primo Hen.</hi> 8. where his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
<hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with a Hempen Garland, and
conclude, that Session to bee Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha,
yet makes his bragges in the
vulgar, how they suffered for the
Common-wealth, and deserve to bee
stiled Martyrs.</p>
            <p>Hee is made all of Cringes and
Complements, as if he dropt out of
the Docke of a Courtier, and can
change himselfe into as many shapes
as Painters can doe colours, either a
decayed Merchant, a broken Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
a silent Minister, an old maym'd
<pb facs="tcp:53794:7"/>
Captaine, a forejudged Atturney, a
busie Soliciter, a crop-car'd Informer,
a pick-thanke Pettyfogger, or a nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pac'd Northerne Tike, that hath
more wit than honestie.</p>
            <p>These are the men that make the
bravest Projectors, who in short
time may bee dignified with the title
of Knight of the Post, or Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
Generall of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>He will pinguisie all manner of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
with Carrots and Turnips, fatten
all foure footed beasts without Hay,
or Grasse, or any manner of Graine,
make bread of Pumpions, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers,
and will finde the Guard
Beefe and Brues for God a mercy, till
their bellies crack; and victuall the
King an Army without meat, and
take all the <hi>Scots</hi> in a pursuit, if they
Rebell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53794:8"/>Hee is an excellent Architecture,
hee will pull downe <hi>White-hall,</hi> and
build the King a new Palace, to which
the banqueting house shall bee but
halfe the Porters lodge, and at his
owne cost, if the King will not give
him leave, hee would turne an hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

to Sommerset house, if the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
were not betweene them, and
then all the poore people may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in <hi>Forma Pauperis</hi> to seek their
Iodgings without certificate of the

<hi>Guido Vaux</hi> his darke Lanthorne, and
by it, hath made a device to convey
people above ground that shall see e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
body, and no man see them, with
the helpe of two footed beasts, and
hath jugled into credit with a strange
name and call it a Sedan.</p>
            <p>He will turne all Waggons, Carts,
<pb facs="tcp:53794:8"/>

horse-flesh in the warres, and to
that intent hath got a Patent to make
wooden horses, fit for Brewers, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
Maulters, and Carriers that
shall doe as good service, as if they
were alive, carry burthens, and fast
much longer.</p>
            <p>Hee is one that scrapes up a living
in this world, though hee be put out
of possession in the next; and hath
crept neatly into the favour of the
Clergie, by advancing the returne
of the whole Kingdome a third part,
whereby their tythes are increased
more than ever.</p>
            <p>Hee can saile thorow <hi>London</hi>
Bridge against wind and Tide, cleare
the Thames from Sands and Shelves;
weigh up all Wracks, though in the
<pb facs="tcp:53794:9"/>
bottome of the Sea, and fifty fat home
under water, blow up the enemy
with fire: if you seeme to doubt any
of these Projects, hee hugges himselfe
with conceit of your ignorance, and
his owne wit: if you question him,
his answer is; This age is a cherisher
of Arts, and new Inventions, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
dull and heavie, that these times
are active, as may appear by the drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Fens, building of Townes,
and Churches, repairing of <hi>Pauls,</hi> his
Majesties expedition to <hi>Yorke,</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>To say truth, he is a man of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
very great in knavery; hee
is well read in deceit of all Trades;
hee knowes how to dye silke to make
it weigh heavy: hee knowes, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
forts of wooll mixt together, will
<pb facs="tcp:53794:9"/>
never cotten well, to make good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micasters:
he knowes those Malsters
are knaves that make a Bushell of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pute above nine in Mault; and I
protest in good earnest, he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
wel, if he can cast out the beams
of his owne eye, that he may see the
clearer to make themselves honest
men.</p>
            <p>He is neither foole nor Physitian,
yet undertakes to reforme all abuses
in the body politick with these three
words, <hi>Carollus Dei Gratia:</hi> like <hi>Scale</hi>
the Mountebanke, that cures all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
with one powder: Hee is a
great Traveller through <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Wales;</hi> but dares not peep in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
untill the King goe in person: hee is
or would bee a man of Government,
for hee desires all things to goe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his will, which he suspects to
be reason: He discourses much of the
<pb facs="tcp:53794:10"/>
danger of the times, and fortifieth
his arguments with old wives Tales,
and believes them to be prophesies, as
<hi>Lincolne</hi> was, <hi>London</hi> is, and <hi>Yorke</hi> shall
bee; and by opinion of his deeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
in State affaires, hath frighted
a company of silly Citizens out of
their houses and estates from <hi>London</hi>
to <hi>Yorke,</hi> in hope to be rich, and will
make them a Corporation free of
Suburbs.</p>
            <p>He is one that thinks he can cozen
the Devill, for hee will VVire draw
the Covetous, and worme the Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of their estates for hope of gaine;
they will drop all three into a hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
budget, if my Art doe not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
me: Hee is a rare extracter of the
quintences of Beere, Ale, VVine, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
Mault, Bricke-tiles, Sope,
Starch, Allome, Cards, Dice, and
Tapsters, <hi>cum multis aliis;</hi> the pure
<pb facs="tcp:53794:10"/>
Spirit gat by imposing a fine, and an
annuall rent upon those that take Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
to sell them, and suffer others to
sell them for nothing.</p>
            <p>Hee is one whose Arse makes but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
by the Bushell at the noyse of a
Parliament, more than the <hi>Scots</hi> do at
the noyse of <hi>English</hi> Drummes, and
hath wrought under hand with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries
and Jesuites like a Mole, to
set dissention betweene the two
Kingdomes, on purpose that hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd
a Parliament, and hath gotten
a Patent or Grant of all the Blew
Bonnets that are taken in the first
battell; but meanes not to be there
himselfe, but stay behind, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse
all the Carrots and Parsnips
that comes to <hi>London,</hi> to make Dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does

            <p>He fell sicke of scouring at Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
founded at a Certificate, lay
in trance at Mr. Aturney, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
fell into a relapse at the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie

Angels ascending, and descending,

sealed, dyed with an obstructing or
stopping at the great Seale, and
made no VVill, as his predecessors
did. Onely you shall heare his
