            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PHILIP. I. 15, 16, 17, 18.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>Some indeed preach Christ even of Envy and Strife,
and some also of Good-will:</p>
                  <p>The one preach Christ of Contention, not Sincerely;
supposing to add Affliction to my Bonds:</p>
                  <p>But the other of Love, knowing that I am set for
the Defence of the Gospel:</p>
                  <p>What then? Notwithstanding, every way, whether
in Pretence, or in Truth, Christ is preached;
and I therein do rejoyce, yea, and will rejoyce.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AMong the other Texts which
have been so ill used by those
that maintain the Divisions of
our Church, there is none more
likely to be urged in the behalf
of the Dissenting Preachers, nor any with
greater appearance of strength than That I
have now read. For, granting us all, we may
possibly think we have Cause to believe, thô
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54095:4"/>
they never will, that such Pastors as they, are
unsent and unqualified, all the ill and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
Preachers in the World; Yet, since
they preach Christ, they may press us still,
that we ought to be so far from Discouraging
of them, that, after the Example of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in the Text, we ought to Rejoyce that the
Doctrine of Christ is any way preached. And
how can such <hi>Rejoycing</hi> consist with the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Prosecution</hi> of them? Or, if We thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute,
or otherwise think fit to appear against
them, how little do we shew of the meek
and Heavenly Temper of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whose
<hi>Successors</hi> we would yet pretend our selves
to be? Nay farther, they may not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to tell us, that if we do not Rejoyce in
their assisting us, it is <hi>We</hi> that envy the Success
of the Gospel, and must be content to take
the <hi>worst</hi> Character in the Text to our
selves.</p>
            <p>For the satisfying which Plea, I shall take
the whole Force of it into Consideration in
the following Discourse; and the better to do
it, shall propose three Inquiries:
<list>
                  <item>I. Who those were of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> here
pronounces, That <hi>they preached Christ out of
Strife and Contention?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54095:4"/>II. How far we are to understand he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
in <hi>their Preaching?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. Whether the Case of the Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preachers in the Text, and those of our
Times, be so much the <hi>same,</hi> that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of our Church, should, by Virtue
of this <hi>Place,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul's Example</hi> in it, be so
obliged to <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in their Ministry, as not to
indeavour the <hi>Suppressing</hi> of it?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And if, in managing these, any Right be
done to the Sense of the Words, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Methods of the Government with respect
to these Men, I shall hope it may be thought
not altogether improper in this Assembly,
since 'twill be the impleading of Preachers
before Preachers; of those that say they can
understand, and teach Christianity, before
those that <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>rightfully</hi> do it.</p>
            <p>We shall, First, then inquire, who Those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
were of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> here pronounces, That
they preached Christ <hi>of Strife and Contention?</hi>
The resolving of which, will very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon our determining, whether they
were Jews remaining still <hi>such,</hi> or Judaizing
<hi>Christians,</hi> or some <hi>other</hi> Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54095:5"/>
of which he was now speaking?</p>
            <p>The Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Loc.</note> who would have
the Jews here meant, gives this Account of
them: <hi>That to put a stop to the Doctrine of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
they every where rumoured of what sort it
was, by what Arguments supported; That so the
greater Recourse might be had to St.</hi> Paul, <hi>to
know the whole of the matter from Himself:</hi> And
all such Resort, in the Place and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
that He now was, they <hi>knew would</hi> be
dangerous, and <hi>might wish</hi> Fatal to him.
Which is, indeed, a very full account of the
<hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi> with which they were
acted. But, with all Submission, does not
seem so fairly to answer for what the Apostle
mentions no less than three times in the Text,
<hi>Their preaching of Christ:</hi> For their spiteful
Noising what the Christian Sect held, cannot
be called, but very abusively, a <hi>Preaching</hi> of
Christ. Besides that he opposes them in this
very place, to Those that preached Christ
out of <hi>Truth and Good Will.</hi> From which it
should seem, that the Gospel on both Hands
was fervently preached, and the difference
only, that it was not done from the same pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Principle. In short, that they were not
Unbelieving Jews, I am farther confirmed
from the Verse immediately foregoing, where
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54095:5"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Many Brethren in the Lord,
waxing confident by my Bonds, are much more bold
to speak the Word without Fear;</hi> And then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>Some indeed preach Christ even of Envy and
Strife:</hi> It is evident therefore that they were
<hi>Brethren,</hi> of the Family of Christ, thô none of
the greatest Sincerity among them.</p>
            <p>If next, it be said, They were Judaizing
Brethren, and under these we must compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> 'twill be hard to say with
any Propriety, that they <hi>preached Christ;</hi> for
they preached Christ and <hi>Moses,</hi> and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Doctrines very distant from either. And
if farther it be urged, that supposing they did
so, the Apostle might rejoyce that they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ any ways, since 'twas better that
the Gentiles who lived in gross Idolatry,
should have <hi>some</hi> knowledg of Christ, <hi>thô
with mixtures,</hi> than know <hi>nothing</hi> at all of him:
'Twill be plausibly said, but not on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
so easy to reconcile this Apostles Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in such sort of Preachers, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Cautions he gives against these very
Men, and with the plainest Reference to them,
<hi>Beware of Dogs, Beware of Evil Workers, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the Concision:</hi> At the third Chapter of
this very Epist. v. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54095:6"/>Pressed therefore with these Difficulties, I
shall rather conceive this Place neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to
the Unconverted Jews, nor Judaizing
Christians, nor, among those, to the Gnostick
Teachers; But to such as indeed preached
<hi>pure Christianity,</hi> thô from no <hi>pure Mind:</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ, but out of <hi>Strife;</hi> with Design to
create Strife and Division in the Church, such
as was when one said,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>another of</hi>
Apollos, <hi>and another of</hi> Cephas; And out of
<hi>Envy;</hi> Envying this great Apostle of Christ,
the Glory of his Success; And out of <hi>Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
Contending with him for the number of
Proselytes: By this means, <hi>supposing to add Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
to his Bonds;</hi> supposing, because Vain-glorious
Themselves, that he might be of a
Temper like Theirs, and so grieved and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
to be rivalled in Fame, and to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed
in the multitude of Converts.</p>
            <p>And those Preachers, thô still Christians,
who could go thus far in Envy, may not ill be
supposed to advance to such a Height of <hi>That,</hi>
and of Contention, as to wish St. <hi>Paul</hi> was
taken out of their way; For one Vice admitted
is not only an Inlet to another, but a greater;
and from hence, to his Bonds they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54095:6"/>
the Addition of more, and of worse, and
even of the last of all temporal Afflictions.
So that when we departed from the excellent
<hi>Grotius,</hi> it was not so much for assigning a
<hi>Wrong Cause</hi> (for they certainly were bad
Friends of the Apostles) as for his pitching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>wrong Men;</hi> The Unbelieving Jews,
when the Context is so plain, They were
<hi>Brethren in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having therefore considered who these
Preachers might most probably be,</p>
            <p>We come 2<hi>ly.</hi> to inquire, How far we are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
to understand the Apostle here rejoyced in
<hi>their</hi> Preaching.</p>
            <p>In proposing of which, I cannot forbear ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
by the way, that those who may urge
this Passage for the countenancing the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Preachers abroad in our days, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be able to make it appear, that it <hi>solely</hi> refers
to the Subject of Preaching, which yet this
Plea supposes it to do. For, if they make a
Comment from the Verses preceding, to the
Sense we have heard, and press that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
more than once rejoyced that Christ was
preached in any sort whatever, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54095:7"/>
those that succeed him should be of the
like mind: I think I may with great safety
tell them, That at least some part of this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing</hi>
relates to a matter of a quite different
Consideration: <hi>I rejoyce,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>yea,
and will rejoyce. For,</hi> as he adds in the very next
words, <hi>I know that this shall turn to my Salvation,
through your Prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of
Jesus Christ.</hi> So that, 'tis plain, some share of
his Rejoycing is to be given to the Blessed
Hopes and Assurance he had, that his patient
bearing the Malice of these Enemies, would
at length redound to the Augmentation of his
Glory and Happiness. If therefore they press
us with what went before, by way of Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we might take in what follows; which
they must allow to be no unfair way of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
unless they will incur the Censure
of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Evarg.</note> who observes in his time
some Men perverted this very Text, <hi>Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
what preceded, or what followed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But omitting this, and to answer more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
how far the Apostle rejoyced in the
Preachers he was now speaking of, it may
not be amiss to consider, what the Success of
their preaching Christ <hi>Eventually</hi> proved: And
what the <hi>Real and True Purpose</hi> was, from which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54095:7"/>
they took this Office upon them. <hi>Accidentally</hi> it
proved the means of propagating the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the Gospel; and 'twas very consistent
with the Piety of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to rejoyce, that, since
himself <hi>now in Bonds</hi> could not do it, others
were industrious to diffuse the Doctrine of his
Saviour in the World: Which still might be,
without his being satisfied with the Motives of
their Diligence, in which he could no more
express a Complacencie, than he would have
done in <hi>Strife,</hi> or <hi>Envy,</hi> or <hi>Contention</hi> it self.
<hi>However,</hi> says he, <hi>whether in Pretence, or in
Truth, Christ is Preached;</hi> Whether by Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies, by <hi>Accident</hi> only; <hi>Or
whether by Truth,</hi> from the <hi>true</hi> Design of those
that undertake it, the Gospel was declared:
And in this <hi>He rejoyced, yea, and would rejoyce;</hi>
Not that they preached from any ill Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But that by this means, the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, bringing Good out of Evil, great
numbers were brought to the Knowledg of
Christ, who were before in Ignorance of
Him.</p>
            <p>From whence we now proceed in the third <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
place to inquire, Whether the Case of the
Contentious Preachers in the Text, and Those
of our Times, be so much the <hi>same,</hi> that the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54095:8"/>
Governours of our Church should by Virtue
of this <hi>Passage,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Example</hi> in it, be
so obliged to <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in their Ministry, as not
to indeavour the <hi>Suppressing</hi> of it?</p>
            <p>To which I answer;
<list>
                  <item>
                     <p>1. That it would be remembred, There is
nothing in this Passage that is any <hi>Approbation</hi>
of such sort of Preachers, as those the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
had occasion here to mention.</p>
                     <p>All that he does, and it is indeed with great
Gentleness he does it, is, to take Notice that
there were some of the Christian Name who
preached Christ of <hi>Envy and Strife;</hi> and not
from the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> Intention which was
to have bin so much wished among them:
But this, however, is very far from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of them.<note place="margin">In Loc.</note> 
                        <hi>He does not,</hi> says <hi>Erasmus,
encourage that any should preach Christ unsincerely,
but out of things that were not well done, collects
what was best; and contemns their Personal Hatred
to himself, so long as it any ways promoted the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
And how calmly soever the Apostle here
reflects upon such sort of Preachers, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in the very next Chapter;<note place="margin">v. 3.</note> He exhorts the
Philippians, <hi>That nothing be done by them out of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54095:8"/>
Strife and Vainglory,</hi> which are the very Things,
for which these Men are particularly mark'd.</p>
                     <p>If therefore our Dissenters shall think fit to
tell the Governours of the Church, They
ought, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to rejoyce in their Success;
they may withal consider, St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses
<hi>little Likeing</hi> to the <hi>Men,</hi> or the <hi>Principles</hi> upon
which they set Themselves to work: And
from his Example they can, consequently,
build little Kindness to Themselves; which
notwithstanding is that they are most supposed
to mean. But</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p>2. Were this Passage allowed to be a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
<hi>Forbearance</hi> of such Unsincere Preachers,
yet 'tis <hi>no Direction</hi> to the People to hear them.</p>
                     <p>'Tis observable to this Purpose, that those
to whom the Apostle here writes, were no
Hearers of such Preachers, but of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and
of those that, like Himself, preached Christ <hi>out
of Truth;</hi> being planted under <hi>Bishops,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by v. 1. Not that there were more Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
than one in <hi>Philippi</hi> it self, but that there
were more in the Territories of this Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.
And those under their Charge are advised,
and directed in this very Chapter, as much as
the most fervent Prayers in the Case could be
instructive to them, <hi>That their Love might abound
yet more and more in Knowledg and in all Judgment;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54095:9"/>
that they might approve things that are excellent; that
they might be sincere,</hi> (which it is evident those
Preachers were not) <hi>and without Offence, till the
day of Christ,</hi> at 9, and 10. vers. <hi>That they would
stand fast in one Mind, striving together for the
Faith of the Gospel, and in nothing terrified by their
Adversaries,</hi> at 27, and 28. vers. And more
particularly, he commends them in Chap. 2.
<hi>As those who had always obeyed, not as in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
only, but now much more in his Absence,</hi> v. 12.
So that here are Prayers that they might, and
Commendations that they did stand fast in the
Doctrine he had planted among them, or of
those that himself had appointed in his <hi>Absence;</hi>
But not one word to recommend this other
kind of Preachers to the Hearing of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts.
He only tells them, such Preachers were
gone abroad in the World; And safely he
might tell them, as those that were not likely
to be drawn aside, either from himself, or those
that preached the Gospel out of Good Will,
and from unfeigned Sincerity. But it must be a
very odd Deduction from this, if the Dissenting
Preachers among us, will from hence conclude,
That our Rulers are obliged to let the <hi>World</hi>
run after them, from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Not</hi>
giving the People the least hint in the World
to be Followers of such Preachers.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:54095:9"/>
                     <p>3. 'Twould be farther added, that a great
Difference is to be put between preaching the
Gospel, from what Principle soever, to a <hi>People
Unconverted,</hi> and gathering a <hi>Church from out of
a Church already rightly setled.</hi> That those who
here preached Christ of <hi>Envy and Strife,</hi> did
not so much intermeddle with Persons <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi>
before, as indeavour to make <hi>new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi>
to the Doctrine of the Gospel, seems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
clear and evident from the <hi>Contentious</hi> end
of their Preaching, which was <hi>to add,</hi> as the
Apostle here tells us, <hi>Affliction to his Bonds. They
very well knew,</hi> as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observes,<note place="margin">Ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> 
                        <hi>that
he was already obnoxious to</hi> Nero <hi>for publishing a
Doctrine so contrary to his Vices; and therefore they
preached the same Doctrine St.</hi> Paul <hi>did, that so
this Persecutor hearing from his Enemies the vast
Progress of it, might be the more exasperated against
him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But thus to exasperate him, their readiest
way was, not so much to <hi>confirm</hi> the Disciples
this Apostle had made, as to <hi>add</hi> more to them;
and by winning over as many as they could,
both of Jews and Gentiles, to spread the
Gospel of our Saviour the more, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
of it, might the easier be induced to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54095:10"/>
the utmost Rage and Severity against him, as
being esteemed the Head of the Party. But,
all this while, they taught those who had not
learned before the Gospel of Christ; which
cannot be the Case of the <hi>bold and Contentious</hi>
Preachers of our Times. They do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to teach a People already untaught, or
to carry the Gospel where 'twas never <hi>heard;</hi>
but obtrude themselves upon those that were
before instructed in the Faith, set up a Church
within a Church already committed to the
Care of <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Competent</hi> Guides; And
thus putting their Sickle into other mens Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
they have so little share in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,</hi>
that they have his <hi>own Practice</hi> expresly
against them, <hi>So have I strived,</hi> says he, <hi>to
preach the Gospel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 20. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Not where Christ was named, lest
I should build upon another Mans Foundation. But
as it is written, to whom he was not spoken of, they
shall see, and they that have not heard, shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p>4. And lastly, it would farther be observed,
that a vast Difference is to be made between
preaching Christ from <hi>Contention,</hi> or <hi>Envy</hi> to a
<hi>Particular</hi> Person, and preaching up a <hi>general</hi>
Contention, <hi>in the Name of Christ.</hi>
                     </p>

            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54095:10"/>It has already bin mentioned that those
here took notice of, were such as preached the
Gospel out of Envy to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> such as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a very ill Eye upon the glorious Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of his Ministry, and therefore out of Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and Strife contended with him for the
number of Disciples, and the multiplying those,
they supposed, but vainly, might add Grief
of Mind to his Bodily Confinement; might
add new Griefs, and fresh Dangers to him
from his Enemies at <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>he was now
set for the Defence of the Gospel,</hi> or for his having
defended and maintained it.</p>
            <p>A Design in those that carryed it on, wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
different from the very Spirit of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
But yet they preached <hi>Christianity</hi> still,
for, 'twas <hi>Christ</hi> whom they <hi>preached;</hi> and
when it is said, <hi>they did it not of Truth and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
it does not refer to the <hi>Matter</hi> of their
Doctrine, as if they taught what was false
and unfound; but to their <hi>Intention,</hi> which was
not so truly to advance the Knowledg of Christ
in the World, as to grieve this Blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
and to create him more Hardships and ill
Usage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:54095:11"/>
               <hi>He does not,</hi> says the Father before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

where it falls in their way to consider this
place; <hi>He does not speak of such who taught He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical

Christ, but did it from no right Purpose of Mind.</hi>
So that whatever the Motives were to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of undertaking the Ministry, it appears,
what they taught was no other than Orthodox,</p>
            <p>But as for our present Contentious Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
'twill be difficult for them to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that they preach <hi>the Truth as it is in Christ
Jesus.</hi> 'Twill be hard for them to show that
they do not preach up a <hi>National</hi> Contention
<hi>in the Name of Christ,</hi> which was more than
these did. Why else do we hear from them
so many Doctrines, tending not only to lessen,
but destroy the very Being and Authority of
that Church, which is established upon <hi>the
Foundation of Prophets and Apostles!</hi> Why else do
we hear from them so many Positions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of Monarchy, and so dangerous to
Kings, for whom this very Apostle exhorts us,
<hi>especially to make Supplications, and Prayers, and
Thanksgivings?</hi> And if thus they preach ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gospel than his, whatever Favour <hi>this</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54095:11"/>
Passage may afford them, I do not know how
it can relieve them from <hi>Another</hi> wherein the

               <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>or an
Angel from Heaven should preach any other Gospel,
than what he had preached, let him be accursed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore, upon the whole, the Preachers
now such, in defiance of the Laws, instead of
carrying on a <hi>Personal</hi> Contention, promote,
and have effectually promoted, a most Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and most <hi>Universal</hi> Disturbance; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but conceive, the Difference is so wide
between those the Apostle refers to in this
place, and those we meet with in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Age, that if our Governours, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
has ever been kind to its cost, should
still think it safe and prudent to forbear the
suppressing of them; it is <hi>more</hi> than these
Men can reasonably expect from any thing
this Text can oblige them to do.</p>
            <p>And this being done, I shall now think of
closing the whole, with such Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what has been said, as may either concern
<list>
                  <item>I. The dissenting Preachers, or</item>
                  <item>II. Our selves of this Clergy, or</item>

or of Us. And</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> To the dissenting Preachers I would from
hence, with all tenderness, recommend, their
impartial Considering the great Evil of
preaching Christ, if they should truly preach
him, from <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention,</hi> and from <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincere
Ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they say they have considered this alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and do not take themselves to be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it; I would pray them, as <hi>Casuists,</hi> to
resolve us, whether, supposing a <hi>third sort</hi> of
Men should begin a Separation in the Church,
without any <hi>just</hi> Cause; afterwards, refuse all
<hi>reasonable</hi> Terms of Accommodation; and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
take all the Courses they could think of
to <hi>perpetuate the Difference,</hi> they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they were something influenced by a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Contention?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They must thus pronounce, if they think
there are such things as Contention, or Strife
in the World; and if they do so, at the very
same time, they pronounce against <hi>themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:54095:12"/>For, that <hi>they</hi> begun the Breach without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>just</hi> Cause, there can nothing be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
than their separating from us, not as we
did from <hi>Rome,</hi> from the ever justifiable Cause
of its having corrupted the Substantials of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
But for Things, in their own Nature,
Harmless and Indifferent; For the sake of
things, which they never did, and never will
be able to oppose, but by so many Cavils as
will argue more plainly a <hi>Desire of Contention,</hi>
than any <hi>just Exception</hi> they have to them.</p>
            <p>That they refuse all reasonable Terms of
Accommodation, they have put beyond all
Question since the little fruit of all <hi>Conferences</hi>
held with them, and the absolute Stiffness
with which they insist to this very day, that
the Government should yield all to <hi>them,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>due</hi> Complyance on <hi>their Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that they indeavour to <hi>perpetuate</hi> the
Difference, as much as in them lies, what
more convincing Arguments can we have, than
their raising <hi>new Academies?</hi> For by this they
do not mean the Controversie shall die with
them: What more convincing Arguments
can we have, than the Universal Cry of their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54095:13"/>
               <hi>Leaders,</hi> till then never heard of, against the
very <hi>Doctrines</hi> of our Church for some time
before the <hi>Expiration</hi> of the Act for renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Covenant? By which, what could
they mean, but that this which at first they
said to be so great a Snare to their Consciences,
being now taken away, they must either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
come over to our Church, or start some
new Difference to keep on foot their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from it?</p>
            <p>But leaving this with them, from a <hi>Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi>
I am next to pass to an <hi>Unsincere</hi> End of
preaching the Gospel. And here again, I
would calmly ask them, if <hi>themselves</hi> were
to assign the marks of <hi>Sincerity</hi> in the serving
of Christ, whether one would not be, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
at first to serve him <hi>aright,</hi> so that men
should not <hi>run</hi> before they were <hi>sent,</hi> or serve
the God of <hi>Order</hi> in <hi>disorderly</hi> ways? Which
yet they must give us leave to fear themselves
do, till we have from them a better account,
than has hitherto been given, of the <hi>lawfulness</hi>
of their <hi>Call</hi> to the <hi>Work of the Ministry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would have them ask <hi>themselves,</hi> if they
preach so <hi>sincerely</hi> as they pretend, what they
mean by their designed and affected clouding
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54095:13"/>
the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the Gospel with mysterious and
set Phrases? Whether they do not justly give
occasion to think they have some bad Ends to
serve upon their Hearers, when they thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially
cast a Mist before their Eyes, create
Depths where there are none, and obscuring
plain Truths, amuse and confound, instead
of instructing, or enlightning their Followers?</p>
            <p>I would have them ask <hi>themselves,</hi> if they
only mean <hi>the Honour and Success of the Gospel of
Christ,</hi> why they chuse, so observably, to
preach in such Places where there are great
Presumptions they may rather consult <hi>their own
Profit and Advantage?</hi> Why in <hi>Market-Towns,</hi> in
populous and rich Places, but to get more
<hi>Proselytes,</hi> that is, more <hi>Benefactors,</hi> rather than
in <hi>Finland,</hi> or the steril parts of <hi>Norway,</hi>
where Preaching is more <hi>scarce,</hi> and the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
more <hi>low?</hi> For, I cannot imagine but
that were their zeal for the Glory of God, the
yearning of their Bowels for the Souls of Men,
so great as they say, they would give their first
Care to the Souls that most need it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
their zeal <hi>in a barren and dry Land,</hi> as well
as that which <hi>flows with Milk and with Honey;</hi>
And since they don't do this, I know not how
to name the Principle that guides them, but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54095:14"/>
I am not very sure that it is the Sincerity, from
which this Apostle told the <hi>Corinthians, I seek
not yours, but you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore these amount to <hi>Proofs</hi> of their
Contention, and Unsincerity in preaching the
Gospel, it is plain they live in <hi>two</hi> as ill Vices
as can belong to any Christian Preachers. If
they only amount to so many strong and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
<hi>Presumptions,</hi> it is yet a mighty scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
they give to Christianity; and if they are
the <hi>Ingenious,</hi> the <hi>Knowing</hi> and <hi>Conscientious</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
they would be taken for, they cannot but
consider the Advantages they give by this
means to the <hi>common Enemies</hi> of all Religion:
Not omitting, that whatever turbulent Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
their <hi>Followers</hi> may be guilty of, are very
justly to be charged upon <hi>themselves,</hi> whose
very preaching contrary to Law, first brought
the Law in <hi>Contempt with their Hearers;</hi> and if
afterwards they run into greater Enormities, it
is but Proficiency still in that <hi>Contempt of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
which the <hi>Example,</hi> as well as the
<hi>Doctrines</hi> of their Leaders had taught them.</p>
            <p>And now, if after all, the dissenting Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
will shift this from themselves, and say we
have taken all along for granted their being
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54095:14"/>
               <hi>Contentious and Unsincere Preachers,</hi> which is
more than they think they have reason to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
themselves to have bin, I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
add, that they cannot, notwithstanding,
say this urged improperly to them, <hi>since both
they and we agree that the Faulty and the Criminal
may be pressed with Considerations suitable to their
Case, thô we are not sure we shall always convince
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We pass next to the second general Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
to <hi>our selves,</hi> who have the Honour of
being of this Clergy: And under this I would
first humbly offer the great Care we ought
to take, as at the first Entrance upon our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Office, so thrô the whole course of it, to
preach the Gospel <hi>in Truth and Sincerity.</hi> For,
we see, the best things, eaven the preaching
of Christ, is not to be undertaken but from a
<hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Sincere</hi> Mind. We are therefore not
only to deliver what is Truth, but to do it
from a <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Unfeigned</hi> Intention of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
the Glory of God in the World, and
setting forward the Salvation of Men; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of this despising the other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of worldly Advantage, Honour, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect;
which yet are due to us for our Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake:
and much more detesting the Exercise
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54095:15"/>
of so Holy a Function as ours, from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
Ends of <hi>Strife, Vainglory, Envy, or Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
It will be hard to convince Gainsayers
that we preach the Gospel out of <hi>Good will,</hi> if
we give them cause to think that we only
preach it from Good will <hi>to our selves;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the great fitness that a pure Religion
should be taught from a pure Principle, there
is this Advantage in it, which I shall ever
think very Considerable, that when we <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely</hi>
and <hi>principally</hi> mean the Glory of God,
and good of Souls by it, 'twill be that which
will secure us in the course of our Ministry,
from those <hi>mean Complyances,</hi> those <hi>unmanly Arts,</hi>
and <hi>little Condescensions,</hi> which make any Man,
for Interest, cheap and contemptible, but of
all Men, a <hi>Clergyman</hi> most.</p>
            <p>2. From hence I infer, the great Diligence
we should use in our several Stations, lest
those that preach Christ out <hi>of Strife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
should <hi>out-watch</hi> and <hi>out-labour us.</hi> If we
will not take Care of our <hi>Province,</hi> we are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
convinced that others are ready at hand
to invade it; they will tell our Charge, <hi>out of
Charity to them:</hi> and thô we know well enough,
<hi>'tis the Charity of our Charge</hi> they expect again;
yet the very <hi>Pretence</hi> would be taken away
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54095:15"/>
from <hi>them,</hi> the very <hi>Reproach</hi> be taken away
from <hi>us,</hi> who ought so well to fill our seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Places, as to leave no room for any <hi>Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi>
But room would be left, and Advantages
taken, and the People stray more from us,
and our own Sincerity be called into question,
if we were remiss in the work of the Ministry;
and the Consequence of this, as well as the
Guilt of so great a Neglect, are too well
known, and I hope so well precautioned, as
not to need any farther enlargement, where I
now am.</p>
            <p>3. From hence I infer, the great reason we
our selves have, not to give any Countenance
to <hi>Contentious</hi> Preachers, by <hi>Uncanonical Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or Complyances.</hi> For so much as we recede,
in any Point whatever, from the stated Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church, so much Encouragement
we manifestly give to those who preach in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Opposition to it. If, to gratify any one,
we will administer the Sacrament <hi>sitting,</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
without <hi>Sureties,</hi> or the <hi>sign</hi> of the Cross,
or marry without <hi>Banns</hi> or <hi>Licence,</hi> or on any
occasion, wilfully <hi>omit</hi> the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the
Church, it is to do what themselves could
wish; and with this further Circumstance,
that they have it in their Power to say of us;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54095:16"/>
we our selves as to these things, and the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness
of them, are of the same Opinion with
them: And what is this, but to strengthen
their Obstinacy, and, by our own Example,
to confirm them in the Contempt of that very
Church, the Authority of which we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
our selves to preserve?</p>
            <p>4. And lastly, From hence I infer, the vast
Obligation under which we all are, to avoid
<hi>Contention</hi> one with another. For, why should
we, who have had both the Honour and
Blessing of the same Episcopal Imposition of
Hands, have the same great Concern of Souls
to advance, and do it by preaching the same
Gospel of Peace, why, of all Men, should we
have Variance with each other? It is too
much occasion of <hi>Contest</hi> our Enemies give us;
and with them 'tis a <hi>noble Contention,</hi> because it
is a <hi>Contending for the Truth.</hi> But if to the
Breaches they make upon us, we will open
more of our own Accord, and divide that
Force with which we should oppose them;
they may in all probability succeed, but it will
be little Credit either <hi>to our Courage,</hi> or <hi>to our
Integrity.</hi> In two words, could so monstrous
a thing be supposed, as that any of our own
Body could fly in the Face of their lawful Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54095:16"/>
betray the Peace and Settlement of the
Church of which they are Members, and
<hi>Preach,</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> out of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Strife;</hi> the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thing to be said of them is, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Kindness they can shew to our Church,
next to that of publick Retractation and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,
would be <hi>publickly</hi> to Renounce it:
For the same Reason, that it would be better
for the <hi>Obstinate</hi> and <hi>Scandalous</hi> to renounce
their <hi>Baptism,</hi> than under the <hi>Pretence</hi> of it to
fall into such Practices as <hi>cause the Name of Christ
to be blasphemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence, in the last place, I proceed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
to the Deductions which may concern the
People that are either Hearers of the <hi>Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preachers</hi> among us, or of <hi>our selves.</hi> And
here I would pray their Permission to mind
them.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That they would not think the <hi>worse</hi> of
Christianity, for the <hi>Jarrs</hi> and <hi>Contentions</hi> of the
Preachers of it. Indeed, if all who pretend
to <hi>teach,</hi> did but truly <hi>follow</hi> this Doctrine, we
should hear of <hi>no</hi> Divisions: The sweet and
peaceable Genius of it, would either <hi>prevent,</hi>
or <hi>cure</hi> Animosities; and Love and Unity
would be, <hi>as of old,</hi> its Honourable Badges:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54095:17"/>
But if instead of this, <hi>some</hi> will propagate more
of <hi>Contention</hi> than <hi>Christ;</hi> and <hi>we,</hi> as it is our
Duty, withstand them, the People from hence,
would very ill collect, that Christianity ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to <hi>Variance,</hi> without considering that it
lies more in the <hi>Temper</hi> of these Men: They
would much worse collect, that because the
Preachers of it do not always agree, Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
it self is <hi>nothing</hi> at the Bottom; For our
very differing about the <hi>Superstructure</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
on all hands the <hi>Foundation</hi> to be Real.
They cannot therefore, in reason, admit any
Prejudice against Religion for the sake of its
<hi>Ministers;</hi> but ought, on the contrary, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate
those Ministers who do so much Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service
to Religion.</item>
               <item>2. From hence I would likewise mind them
how great Care they ought to take, what
Spiritual Guides they commit themselves to.
For, if they follow Contentious Preachers, it
is very great odds but that they themselves
will in a short time be as <hi>perverse</hi> and <hi>contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as they;</hi> their Nature will be sowred by the
Principles of their <hi>Leaders,</hi> and the visible signs
of their profiting by their Ministry will be,
their being more <hi>Sowr,</hi> and more <hi>Froward</hi> still.
So that to the Ease and Innocence of their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54095:17"/>
Lives, it is necessary they consider, who it is
that they take for the <hi>Conduct</hi> of them. Not
that I mean they are left at large to <hi>chuse</hi> or to
<hi>follow</hi> what Preachers they will; For <hi>God,</hi> and
<hi>the Government</hi> have determined <hi>that</hi> for them,
and the <hi>same Providence</hi> which made them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of such a Place, has <hi>fixed such a one</hi>
as the Preacher of it, from whom they are not,
without the most weighty Causes, to depart:
But before they depart from a <hi>lawful Ministry,</hi>
it concerns them to be well satisfied what <hi>other</hi>
Ministry they put themselves under; to <hi>try the
Spirits,</hi> and <hi>examin</hi> whether Doctrines, in their
natural Consequence, tending to <hi>Strife,</hi> the
Subversion, or Disturbance of all Order and
good Government, rellish more of pure and
uncorrupt Christianity, than the quiet Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to God and to Magistrates, which our
Church has ever taught, and which cannot be
<hi>left, upon any Exceptions,</hi> for any <hi>other</hi> Church,
against which there will not <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>more
just Exceptions</hi> be readily found.</item>
               <item>3. And to conclude, From the whole I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
the great Obligation upon those of the
Laity, <hi>whose Office requires it,</hi> to use all lawful
Means of putting a stop to this sort of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
If they will not, as one would think by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54095:18"/>
this time they should, in Conscience <hi>desist;</hi> I
shall think it no hard Conclusion to say, it is
you that ought <hi>in Conscience, to suppress them;</hi> the
<hi>Places</hi> you are in, and the <hi>Oaths</hi> you have taken,
will press you more to it, than I shall now do:
I shall only tell you, if they have no Right to
the Apostles <hi>Rejoycing,</hi> they have less to your
<hi>Favour</hi> and if they tell us, this is preaching
<hi>Persecution,</hi> 'twill be very difficult for them to
prove, that any are <hi>Persecuted</hi> but <hi>for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
sake;</hi> which can never be their Case, as
matters now stand, unless, by a very soft Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
we will call those the <hi>Schools of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
which have so lately, and more than
once appeared <hi>the Nurseries of Rebellion.</hi> I would
not say this in the manner I do, but that the
<hi>whole Being</hi> of our Church is at Stake, <hi>These</hi>
the Men that boldly undermine it, and <hi>you</hi>
that are set as the <hi>Guardians</hi> of it. All they can
have to plead for themselves, your <hi>Ministers,</hi>
you need not fear, will be able to <hi>answer;</hi>
But after all, 'tis <hi>you</hi> will soonest <hi>convince</hi> them,
I mean, <hi>you</hi> that are in <hi>Office,</hi> and will <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi>
execute it. Which that you may do, and
we with like Sincerity perform our Parts, and
both so successfully as to secure the Peace of
Christ's Church, <hi>Let us in the humblest manner
beseech the Prince of Peace, and great Bishop of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54095:18"/>
our Souls, even the Lord Christ Jesus, to whom
with the Father, and the Blessed and Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
be all Honour and Praise, and Might and
Dominion, now and evermore,</hi>
