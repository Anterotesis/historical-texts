            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>That he could trusted be no more,</l>
               <l>Wherefore he ranne out of the doore</l>
               <l>Most swiftly.</l>
               <l>From whence he went away to Sea,</l>
               <l>Sure he was bitten with a Flea,</l>
               <l>For he could not but pitty plea,</l>
               <l>For cheating.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49562:5"/>
The Hostesse when her guest was gone,</l>
               <l>Did wring her hands, and make great moane,</l>
               <l>And many times did fetch a groan</l>

               <l>A scolding.</l>
               <l>Then rapt she out an oath and swore,</l>
               <l>That shee her purse would lend no more</l>
               <l>To such as would runne on the score,</l>

               <p>Yes faith <hi>Dick</hi> that he is, and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that he fled as swift as if hee had beene
carryed in a Swallowes belly.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Is't possible? Ile tell thee (<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi>)
hee was as faire a speecht fellow as
one should have heard speake in a Sommers
day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
               <p>Ile warrant thee hee owed more
scores than one: or else I know that hee had
such friends as would not have suffered him
to runne away for so small a trifle as that
was.</p>

               <l>Tis not concerning any State,</l>
               <l>But of a Knave and a make bate,</l>
               <l>cald cut-throat.</l>
               <l>His purse is full, and he doth wrong;</l>
               <l>Alas! he hath lived too long:</l>
               <l>But now he is in prison strong,</l>
               <l>As some say.</l>
               <l>He set his neighbours by the eares,</l>
               <l>And put them in a thousand feares,</l>
               <l>His poore wife she shed brinish teares,</l>
               <l>For him knave.</l>
               <l>He ruled them like as a Lord,</l>
               <l>And bound them with a threefold cord,</l>
               <l>And all upon his owne accord,</l>
               <l>Most basely.</l>
               <l>But now he singeth in a Cage,</l>
               <l>A way to coole his fiery rage,</l>
