            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I Think it becomes me, as a Duty which I owe to my Country, and to the Character I have the undeserved Honor to bear in the Church, to give the World some Account, how my Innocency was clear'd from the late Wicked Contrivance against me: In hopes that this Example of a false Plot so manifestly detected, may be, in some sort, beneficial to the whole
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41219:3"/>
Nation on the like Occasions for the future: However, that the Enemies of the Church may have no Reason to cast any Blemish upon it, from the least Suspicion of my Guilt: And that this faithful Memorial may remain as a poor Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my own Gratitude to Almighty GOD, to whose immediate Protection I cannot but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this extraordinary Preservation.</p>
            <p>Perhaps my Reader, at first view, will look on this Relation, as too much loaded with small Particularities; such as he may judge scarce worth my remembring, or his knowing: But he will pardon me, if I presume that nothing in this whole Affair ought to appear little, or inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, to me at least, who was so nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the event of it.</p>
            <p>I have therefore made no scruple to discharge my weak Memory of all it could retain of this Matter; Nor have I willingly omitted any Thing, though never so minute, which, I thought, might serve <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to fix this wonderful Mercy of GOD the more on my own Mind; or d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d any way conduce to the saving of divers other innocent Persons Lives, as well as mine.</p>
            <p>I cannot indeed Promise, that I shall accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeat every Word or Expression, that fell
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41219:3"/>
from all the Parties here mentioned: Or that I shall put all down in the very same Order, as it was spoken, having not had the Opportunity to take Notes of every thing as it pass'd. But this I will say; if I shall not be able to relate all the Truth, yet I will omit nothing that is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial: I will as carefully as if I were upon my Oath, give in all the Truth I can remember, and nothing but the Truth.</p>
            <p>What I Write I intend shall consist of Two Parts. The First, To be a Narrative of the plain Matter of Fact from my first being taken into Custody, <hi>May</hi> the 7th, to the time of my last Dismission <hi>Iune</hi> the 13th. The Second, To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain some Account of the Two Perjur'd Wretches that were pleas'd, for what Reasons they know best, to bring me into this Danger.</p>
            <p>For the Truth of the Substance of what I shall recollect on the first Head, I am bold to appeal to the Memories of those Honourable <hi>LORDS</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> by whom I was thrice Examin'd. And touching the second, I have by me so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Original Papers, or Copies of unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Authority, (which I am ready to shew any Worthy Persons, who shall desire the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) as are abundantly sufficient to justifie all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41219:4"/>
that I shall think fit for me to say against <hi>Blackhead,</hi> and <hi>Young</hi>; especially against <hi>Young.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was on <hi>Saturday</hi> the seventh of <hi>May</hi> of this present Year 1692, in the Evening, as I was walking in the Orchard at <hi>Bromeley,</hi> Meditating on something I design'd to Preach the next Day; that I saw a Coach and four Horses stop at the outer Gate, out of which two Persons alighted. Immediately I went towards them, believing they were some of my Friends, coming to give me a Visit. By that time I was got to the Gate, they were enter'd into the Hall: But seeing me hastning to them, they turn'd, and met me about the middle of the Court. The Chief of them perceiving me to look wistly on them, as being altogether Strangers to me, said, <hi>My Lord, Perhaps you do not know me. My Name is</hi> Dyve, <hi>I am Clerk of the Council, and here is one of the King's Messengers. I am sorry I am sent on this Errand. But I am come to Arrest you upon suspicion of High Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, said I, I suppose you have a Warrant for so doing; I pray let me see it. He shew'd it me, I read it; and the first Name Highted on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41219:4"/>
being the Earl of <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s; I said, Sir, I believe this is my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s own Hand, and I submit. What are your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders how to dispose of me? <hi>My Lord,</hi> said he, <hi>I must first search your Person, and demand the Keys you have about you.</hi> My Keys I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently gave him. He search'd my Pockets; and found no Papers, but some poor Notes of a Sermon, and a Letter from Mr. <hi>B. Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> about ordinary Business.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now,</hi> says he, <hi>My Lord, I must require to see the Rooms to which these Keys belong, and all the Places in the House, where you have any Papers or Books.</hi> I straight conducted him up Stairs into my Study. This, Sir, said I, is the only Chamber where I keep all the Books and Papers I have in the House. They began to Search, and with great readiness turn'd over every thing in the Room, and Closets, and Presses, shaking every Book by the Cover, opening every part of a Chest of Drawers, where were many Papers, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly some Bundles of Sermons; which, I told them were my proper Tools; And that all that knew me, could Vouch for me, it was not my Custom to have any Treason in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41219:5"/>
them. They read several of the Text, and left them where they found them. But in one corner of a Press, which was half open, they met with a great number of Letters fil'd up. I assur'd them they were only Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of usual Friendly Correspondence, and most of them were of last Years date. Mr. <hi>Dyve</hi> looking on some of them, found them to be so; and said, <hi>If he had time to view them all, he might, perhaps, see reason to leave them behind; But being expressly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bring all Letters, he must carry them with him.</hi> I left him to do as he pleased; so they seal'd them up.</p>
            <p>Then they went into my Bedchamber, and the Closets adjoining, doing as they had done in my Study, feeling about the Bed and Hangings, and knocking the Wainscot in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, to see if there were any private Hole, or Secret Conveyance.</p>
            <p>After that they came down Stairs, and search'd the Parlour and Drawing-Room on that side of the House with the like exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. In all these Rooms I observed they very carefully pryed into every part of the Chimneys; the Messenger putting his Hand
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41219:5"/>
into every Flower-Pot: Which I then some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what smiled at: But since I found he had but too much Reason so to do.</p>
            <p>When they had done searching in all those Rooms, and in the Hall as they were going out, and had taken with them what Papers they thought fit; they carryed Me away in the Coach that brought them. By the Way we met my Servant Mr. <hi>Moor</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>London.</hi> I call'd out to him, Have you any Letters for Me? He gave me three or four, which I deliver'd to Mr. <hi>Dyve</hi> to open: Who found nothing in them, but Matters of private Concernment, or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary News. And so, between Ten and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at Night, we arrived at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and I was brought to my Lord-<hi>Nottingham,</hi> whom I found alone in his Office.</p>
            <p>My Lord, said I, I am come upon your Warrant; but certainly there must be some great Mistake, or black Villany in this Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For I declare, as in the Presence of God, I am absolutely free from any just Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation relating to the Government. His Lordship told me, <hi>He himself was much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized when he heard my Name mentioned.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41219:6"/>
I intreated him I might be Examined that Night, if any Witnesses could be produced against me. He said, <hi>That could not possibly be, because the Lords, who had the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such Affairs, were separated, and gone Home: But that I was to appear before them the next Day; and in the mean time, all the Civility should be shewn me, that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by a Man in my Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, said I, I hope, it being so very late, you will suffer me to lie at my own House at <hi>Westminster.</hi> He reply'd, <hi>You shall do so; But you must have a Guard of Soldiers and a Messenger with you.</hi> A Guard of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers said I, My Lord, methinks is not so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to secure one of my Profession; I should rather offer, that I may have two or more Messengers to keep me, tho' that may put me to greater Charges. <hi>My Lord,</hi> said he, <hi>I, for my own part, would be glad, if I might take your Parole; But I must do what I may answer to others; and therefore I pray be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this I acquiesced; only adding, My Lord, here are divers Papers brought up
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41219:6"/>
with me, which, upon my Credit, are but of common Importance; yet, because they are most of them private Talk among Friends; there may be some Expressions, which no Man, if it were his own Case, would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have divulg'd; and therefore I desire your Lordship will take Care they may not be shewn to the Prejudice of any. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, <hi>You have to do with Men of Honour: And you shall have no Occasion to complain upon that Account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so I was convey'd Home to <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> by Mr. <hi>Dyve,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in the Coach with Me, and a Guard at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on each side. After we came to the Deanery, Mr. <hi>Dyve</hi> having diligently sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed my Lodgings, and the Avenues to them, left Me about Midnight, with a strict Charge to the Messenger and Soldiers, not to give me any unnecessary Disturbance; but to watch carefully at my Bed-Chamber-Door till further Orders, which they did.</p>
            <p>The next Day, being <hi>Sunday, May</hi> the 8th, Mr. <hi>Dyve</hi> came again to me about Noon, to acquaint me, That I was to attend the Committee of the Council that Evening by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41219:7"/>
Six o'the Clock. <hi>And,</hi> says he, <hi>My Lord, I suppose you have here also at</hi> Westminster <hi>a Room where you keep the rest of your Books and Papers.</hi> I told him, I had. <hi>Then,</hi> said he, <hi>I have Commission to search there likewise; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in your Cabinet.</hi> I shewed him my Library and gave him the Keys. He open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Presses of Books, and viewed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulary every Shelf, and examined every Drawer in the Cabinet: But finding nothing there of a late date, or that might afford any the least shadow of a Trayterous Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he went away without removing any one Paper thence.</p>
            <p>At the time appointed I was brought by the Messenger and Guard to <hi>Whitehal,</hi> where a select Number of the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were assembled at my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s Lodgings. There were present, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Earl of <hi>Devonshire</hi> Lord Steward the Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of <hi>Nottingham</hi> Secretary of State, the Earl of <hi>Rochester,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Sydney</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Seymo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>

               <p>Sir, I suppose there may be some of a Date since that Time in the Bundles. If I had preserv'd more, they would have been of the same Nature with the rest that you have, that is, concerning common Intelligence, and the Talk of the Town; not any Secrets of State, or against the Government. My Lords, I hold no Correspondencies of that kind. When I am in the Country, I desire some Friend or other here to let me know how the World goes, that I may inform my self, and the Neighbouring Gentlemen, of the Truth of Things, and prevent the spreading of false News: And afterwards I file up such Letters according to their Dates, (as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I did these,) that at any time I may have a present Recourse to them to refresh my Memory in any past Transaction.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:41219:9"/>My Lords, Those are all I thought worth keeping of this kind these two last Years. And I hope the Clerk of the Council has done me the Justice to acquaint your Lordships, how I was apprehended, out of my House; and how narrowly I my self, and my Study, and Lodging-Chamber, and other Rooms, were search'd: So that it was impossible for me to have suppress'd or smother'd any one Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from you. And really I believe there was not a Note, or least Scrip of Paper of any Consequence in my Possession, but they had a view of it.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Earl of <hi>Devonshire.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, my Lord, it is probable a Man of your Interest, and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, must have received more Letters since, than are here to be found. We see here are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny concerning Affairs that pass'd just before that time.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Bishop of</hi> R.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, A little before the Conclusion of the last Session of Parliament, I obtain'd Leave of the House of Lords to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the Country, for the Recovery of my Health. During my abode there, as long as the Parliament continued, I was somewhat curious to learn what pass'd in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41219:9"/>
both Houses, and therefore, as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship has observ'd, Letters came thicker to me about that time. But when the Parliament was up, very little hapning that was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in that interval, I was not so mindful to preserve the Letters that came to me, whilst all Things, both abroad and at home, were rather in Preparation than Action.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Besides that, since the Time your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships speak of, I was twice or thrice in Town for several days together; once especially upon a publick Occasion, the Annual Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Westminster</hi> School; which detain'd me here about a Week. And these are the True Reasons why you find so few Letters to me since the Date of Time your Lordships have mentioned.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Earl of <hi>N.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Will it please your Lordships to ask the Bishop of</hi> Rochester <hi>any more Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>They being all silent, I said, My Lords, I cannot imagine how it comes to pass that I should be thus suspected to be guilty of any Contrivance against the Government; I think I may appeal to all that know me, I am sure I may to all my Neighbours in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41219:10"/>
the Country where I live, that there has no Man submitted to it more peaceably and quietly than I have done ever since the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and I must own, I did it both upon a a Principle of Conscience and Gratitude. Of Conscience, Because I cannot see how the <hi>Church of England</hi> and the <hi>whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion</hi> can be preserv'd but upon this Constitution; since an Invasion from <hi>France</hi> cannot but be destructive to Both. And of Gratitude, Because, as you all know, I happen'd to be, in the late Reign, engag'd in an Affair, which since I have been taught was Illegal. And though, I may say, I stopp'd betimes, and did no great hurt, but hindred, as much as I could, whilst I Acted; yet I Acted so long, that I might have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be severely punish'd for what I did. But the King's and Queen's Part, in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon, was so Gracious and Benign, in making it their own Act, and not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me out of it, that Their Majesties have thereby laid upon me an Obligation never to be forgotten.</p>
            <p>Upon this I was bid to withdraw; and about an Hour after, the same Clerk of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41219:10"/>
Council was sent out to tell me, <hi>The Lords had Order'd I should return to my own House, and be under the same Confinement as before, of a Messenger, and a Guard of Soldiers: And there I should shortly hear what their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships would determine concerning me.</hi> He likewise told the Messenger, and the Guards, <hi>That he had a strict Command to them to use me, with all Respect; only to take Care, that I should be safely kept, and forth-coming.</hi> Nor indeed had I any thing to object against their Behaviour. For, as Mr. <hi>Dyve</hi> demean'd himself always to me like a Gentleman, and the Messenger was very Civil, so the Soldiers themselves were as easie and quiet to the rest of my Family, as if they had been a part of it.</p>
            <p>The same Evening Mr. <hi>Dyve</hi> came home to me, and brought me all my Papers, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me, <hi>That the Lords had heard him read them over; and, having no Exception against them, had sent him to return them all safe to me again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus guarded, I continued from that Day, till the 18th of <hi>May,</hi> under the Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Messenger and of four Centinels,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41219:11"/>
who watched Day and Night, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved every Eight and forty Hours.</p>
            <p>But then, having heard nothing in the mean time from the Lords, I wrote this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Earl of <hi>Nottingham.</hi>

it is utterly false, that he ever brought me a Letter from one <hi>Young.</hi>

                  <p>My Lords, I do remember this Fellow was with me at <hi>Bromley</hi> on a Fast-Day: By the same Token, I told him, he should stay till after Evening-Prayers, and must expect only a fasting kind of Meal.

                  <p>My Lords, This that he says of <hi>Young,</hi> is a wicked Lye; All my Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies are so innocent (as I hope your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships can testifie) that, if I had received a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from any Mr. <hi>Young,</hi> I should have no reason so positively to deny it. I beseech you, examine this Fellow throughly, and I doubt not but you will discover some impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Knavery. I stand to it; I am sure there is no Person whose Name is <hi>Young,</hi> with whom I have of late years maintained any Intercourse by Letters.</p>

                  <p>Oh!

But I suppose, neither of these are the <hi>Youngs,</hi> whose Correspondence this Man objects to me. I should take it for an Honor to Correspond with them. But in Truth it has so happen'd, that I have neither written too, nor receiv'd one Letter from either of them these many Years, to the best of my Knowledge.</p>

                  <p>I have indeed, my Lords, some obscure Remembrance, that some Years ago, there was one writ to me out of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41219:15"/>
                     <hi>Newgate,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Robert Young,</hi> pretending to be a Clergy-Man; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal something of the Contents of his Letter. It was to tell me, That <hi>He and his Wife lay in Prison there upon a False Accusation, of which he hoped they should be speedily clear'd. In the mean time, he desired me to recollect, that he had Officiated some Weeks for the Chaplain at</hi> Bromley-College, <hi>and had Preach'd once or twice in the Parish-Church there. He intreated me to give him a Certificate of this, because it would stand him in much stead in order to his Iustification: And withal, that I would send him something out of my Charity, for his and his Wifes Relief in their great Distress.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>This, my Lords, I dare say, was the whole Substance of that Letter, and this was two or three Years ago at least.</p>
               <p>To that Letter I am sure I made no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in Writing. Only, having not the least Remembrance of him my self, I inquir'd in the Neighborhood, and among the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in the College; intending to have sent him some Alms suitable to his Condition and mine, had I found him worthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41219:16"/>But upon inquiry, I received from all Hands, so very ill a Character both of this <hi>Young,</hi> and his Wife, that I resolv'd to give him no Answer at all; and I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard any thing more of him to this Day.</p>
               <p>But now, I beseech your Lordships, to give me leave to speak to this Person my self: And they intimating I should do as I thought best, I said to him;</p>
               <p>I Conjure you, in the Presence of these Noble Lords, and especially of the Great LORD of Heaven and Earth, that you will declare the Truth of what I am going to ask you.</p>
               <p>When you came to my House at <hi>Bromley,</hi> upon a Fast-Day it was, I think the first Fast of this Year; Did not you desire to speak with me, as having a Letter for me? When I came to you into my Hall, Did not you first kneel down, and ask me Blessing? Did you not then deliver me a Letter, affirming it was from a Country-Minister, a Doctor of Divinity? Did not you tell me, You were his Servant, or Bayliff? And that your Master had sent you on purpose, many Miles
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41219:16"/>
to receive an Answer your self to that Letter from my own Hand?</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Blackhead.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I never brought a Letter to the Bishop of</hi> Rochester <hi>from a Country Minister; I know no such Doctor of Divinity: Nor ever was Servant to any: I only brought a Letter to the Bishop from Mr.</hi> Young.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Bishop of</hi> R.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, What I say is most certainly true. This Man had never any other Business with me, but in relation to that Letter, pretended by him, (for now I find it was but a pretence) to be written to me by an Eminent Country Divine in <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghamshire,</hi> a Person of a Considerable Estate, as he told me. My Lords, I cannot yet call to Mind the Doctor's Name: But the Business of the Letter I am in great part Master of, and it was to this purpose:</p>
               </sp>
               <p>That there was a Person, (naming him,) who had apply'd to him to be his Curate; but that he had Reason to suspect he had Counterfeited my Hand and Seal for Holy Orders: Therefore he desired me to send him Word under my own Hand by the Bearer his Man, Whether I had Ordain'd such a One, in such, or such Years: That if I had,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41219:17"/>
he would Encourage, and Entertain h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m; if not, he would take care, he should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd for his Forgery.</p>
               <p>Now, My Lords, upon the receipt of so Friendly a Letter, by this very Messenger, I bid him stay a little, and I would give his Master Satisfaction out of my Books, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had Ordain'd any Man of that Name; which I thought I had not. Accordingly my Secretary, and I did severally turn over all my Papers relating to such Affairs, as carefully as we could; and finding no such Mans Name in them; in which we could not be easily deceiv'd because I keep Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically (as no doubt every Bishop does) all Recommendations, Subscriptions, Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials, and Titles of those I admit into Orders; I wrote the supposed Author of the Letter, as civil an Answer as his seemed to deserve.</p>
               <p>That I was extreamly pleased, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that a meer Stranger to me should be so careful of my Reputation: That my Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and I, had diligently examin'd all the Books, where such Things are Recorded: And I could assure him, I never had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41219:17"/>
any such Person either Priest or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, within the space limited in his Letter, or at any other time: That I should look upon it as a signal Service done to the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and a special Favour to me in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, if he would, as he promised, cause the Counterfeit to be apprehended, so that the Course of Law might pass upon him.</p>
               <p>This Letter, my Lords, all, Written with my own Hand, I delivered to the Person here present: And he went away with it, asking me Blessing again upon his Knees; and promising I should speedily be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Success.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, It was to the same Person, with the same Superscription as he Subscrib'd himself, and directed to the same Place, where he said he was Minister; tho' the Name of Place or Minister I cannot yet recover. But let that Letter of mine be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and it will put an end to this whole Controversie.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, This is a Horrid Falshood. I well remember now, this Fellow was at my House a second time, some Weeks after the first. When he came, I was in the Garden with some Gentlemen my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; where, first asking me Blessing, he told me, <hi>His Master the Doctor had taken up the Person who had Forg'd my Orders: That the Man stood upon his Vindication; but that his Master was bringing hint up to</hi> London; <hi>and then I should hear farther from him:</hi> Adding, <hi>That his Master was a Man of such a Spirit, and such a plentiful Estate, that whenever he suspected a Man to be a</hi> Rogue, <hi>or a</hi> Cheat, <hi>he would spare no Pains to discover him, nor think any cost too much to get him punish'd.</hi> These, my Lords, I well remember were the Knaves very Words: And I hope your Lordships will likewise deal with him in the same manner. I took this second Message still more kindly, and order'd my Servants to entertain the Messenger very civilly.</p>

                  <p>

                     <hi>My Lord, It was from a Country Minister in</hi> Buckinghamshire, <hi>a Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, as he wrote himself, his Name was</hi> Hooke.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I now very well remember that was the Name, <hi>Hooke,</hi> or something very near it. There may be the Difference of a Letter: I will not stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, or can it be expected I, or my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, should be positive as to every Letter of a Name, in so sudden a Question.</p>

                     <hi>My Lord, it was concerning one that offered himself to be the Doctor's Curate, whom he suspected to have Counterfeited my Lord's Letters of Orders. The Doctor desired my Lord to look into his Books, whether he had Ordain'd any such Person. My Lord and I did thereupon search all the Places where the Memorials of such Affairs are kept, and we found no such Name; and so my Lord himself wrote back to the Doctor, by this very Man that stands here.</hi>

                     <hi>He said, He came to acquaint my Lord, That his Master, Doctor</hi> Hooke, <hi>had seized on the Person who had forg'd his Orders. My Lord ask'd him, Whether he had also seiz'd the False Instrument? And if he had, desired it might be transmitted to him. This Man answered, He believed his Master had got it: That he was coming up to</hi> London, <hi>and bringing the Cheat with him; and had been there sooner, had he not sprain'd or hurt his Leg: But when he was come, the Doctor would give my Lord Notice, or himself wait upon him. My Lord was much pleased with this second Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage; and gave Orders to have the Bringer of it well used. He was so; and freely discoursed with the Butler, and the other Servants, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Business there. So that I am verily perswaded several of them remember all these Circumstances of it, and perhaps more than I do.</hi>

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41219:21"/>As I was going out, I said, My Lords, I cannot comprehend to what purpose this Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low persists in this Lye; I am sure he can never prove that I have injured the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in Word, or Deed, or Writing. Then I could not but again observe to the Lords, what visible Marks of Falshood and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there were in <hi>Blackhead</hi>'s Face. For, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all the while he look'd as if he would have sunk into the Ground: Tho', as I was told afterwards, before I came into the Room he had appear'd very brisk, and bold, and full of Talk. But upon my first coming in, his Complexion, which was naturally very sallow, turn'd much paler and darker; and he was almost Speechless, saying nothing to any purpose, more than what he thought was necessary to keep him firm to the main Lye, That he had brought me a Letter from one <hi>Young,</hi> and no other.</p>
               <p>But after my being withdrawn, about half an Hour, I was called in again, and <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> sent forth.</p>

to you, Written not in the Name of</hi> Young, <hi>but as from one Doctor</hi> Hookes, Hookes <hi>was the Name, not</hi> Hooke, <hi>your Lordship was in the right, in saying, you would not stand upon a Letter.</hi>

               <p>But my next Appearance before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Council, will clear up what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the whole Wicked Mystery.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, returning Home that Evening to <hi>Bromley,</hi> I presently met with a plentiful Concurrence of Evidence from most of my Servants, of their Discourse with <hi>Blackhead,</hi> and their Knowledge of his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, in reference to Dr. <hi>Hookes</hi> Letter.</p>
               <p>First, The Butler <hi>Thomas Warren</hi> told me, That according to my Order to use him kindly, he had done so both times has was with us: Particularly the second time he had entertain'd him with one of the Petty Canons of <hi>Windsor,</hi> who came thither by chance, in the Parlour next the Garden: That thence he brought him down into the Cellar, where <hi>Blackhead</hi> Drunk my Health with Knees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most bended to the Ground: That then he earnestly desir'd him to shew him my Study;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41219:24"/>
saying, I have heard your Lord has a very good Study of Books: My Master <hi>Hookes</hi> has a very good one: He often lets me go into it, and I doubt not but you have the same Liberty: I pray let me see his Books. The Butler an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, My Lord has but few Books here, only such as he brings from time to time from <hi>Westminster</hi> for present use, and they are lock'd up in Presses, so that I cannot shew them if I would. I pray then, said <hi>Blackhead,</hi> let me see the Room, I hear it is a very fine one. The Butler said, He could not presume to do it without my leave. Then, said <hi>Blackhead,</hi> let me see the rest of the House. The Butler excus'd his not being able to do it then, because there were some Ladies with his Mistress. The same Request, he assur'd me, <hi>Blackhead</hi> repeated almost twenty times: But still he deny'd him.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Thomas Philips</hi> my Coachman, and <hi>Iohn Iewel</hi> my Gardiner, confirm'd most of what the Butler had said: All of them agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that both the times he was at <hi>Bromley,</hi> especially the second, he had talked publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them of the Business he came about from his Master Dr. <hi>Hookes:</hi> Enlarging much
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41219:24"/>
in Commendation of the said Doctor, what a Worthy Man he was; What Hospitality he kept; And how he would never rest, till he had brought to Punishment the Knave that had forged my Hand and Seal for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They added, That, after I had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd him, he linger'd about, in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the Hall, and the great Parlour, a long time; and was full of such Discourses.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Gardiner, and <hi>William Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> the Groom, and <hi>Thomas French,</hi> and one or two of the other Servants, who remain'd at <hi>Bromley</hi> whilst I was in the Custody at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> did all assure me, that this Man, who brought first the Letter, and then the Message from Dr. <hi>Hookes,</hi> had been a third time at my House, whilst I was under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. That it was upon a <hi>Sunday</hi> which by Computation prov'd to be <hi>Whit-Sunday, May</hi> 15th, That they found him in the midst of the House, before they knew he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd. He told them that, passing that way, he came to Condole for my Mishap, and to enquire what the Matter was; hoping it was not so bad as was reported at <hi>London.</hi> They answer'd, They knew nothing of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41219:25"/>
yet doubted not but I was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. That he then again desir'd to see the House. But all the Doors were lock'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the great Parlour, which has no Lock upon it. That he would have enticed them to Town to Drink with him; which they refused, but made him Drink there; and he coming after Dinner, they perswaded a Maid-Servant to provide him some Meat: Which she did, but unwillingly, telling them she did not like the Fellows Looks; That perhaps he might come to Rob, or to Set the House, now so few Servants were at Home: That he rather looked (as indeed he did) like some Knavish; broken Tradesman, than an Honest Rich Clergy-Man's Bayliff, or Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, (as he also call'd himself;) and it has proved since, that her Conjecture was true.</p>
               <p>All this, and more, my Servants repeated to me, touching <hi>Blackhead</hi>'s Behaviour in my House, and his Discourse concerning his Master Dr. <hi>Hookes.</hi> And they offer'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it all upon Oath. And, above all, the next Day, being <hi>Saturday, Iune</hi> the 11th, Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> coming from <hi>London,</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41219:25"/>
found the Original Letter, that <hi>Blackhead</hi> had brought me from the pretended Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, being furnished with all these fresh Materials, especially with the Letter it self; and being not a little surprized to hear that the Rogue had, the second time of his coming, been so earnest to get into my Study, or any of the other Rooms; and that he had the Diabolical Malice against me, to come to my House a third time, on pretence of Condoling my Misfortune, which I then thought, it was probable, had chiefly proceeded from his Malicious Perjury against me: All this consider'd, I resolved to go to <hi>London</hi> on <hi>Munday</hi> Morning with these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to carry the Letter that he brought me as from Dr. <hi>Hookes,</hi> to lay the whole Business before the Lords of the Committee, and to desire their farther Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Blackhead</hi> upon these Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>Accordingly on <hi>Munday; Iune</hi> the 13th, I went, and attended the meeting of the Lords that Morning in the usual place. When there was a full Committee, I sent to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41219:26"/>
them by a Clerk of the Council, intreating that I might have a short Audience. After some time, I was introduced. There were present (besides most of the Lords before-mentioned,) three others whom I had not seen there since my first Appearance before them, the Marquiss of <hi>Carmarthen</hi> Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, the Lord <hi>Godolphin,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Lowther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I came into the Room, and was just going to propose the Business that brought me thither: My Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> prevented me, and said;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord, Do you know that Person there?</hi> Pointing to a Man, who stood behind the Privy Consellors, near the Door which leads into the public Room.</p>

               <p>Then the Person standing there look'd boldly upon me, and said, <hi>Do you not knom me,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41219:26"/>
my Lord? Do not you remember, that I officiated some Weeks at</hi> Bromley-College, <hi>for Mr.</hi> Dob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>in King</hi> James's <hi>Time? And that I Preached in the Parish Church there once or twice?</hi>

                  <p>My Lords, I solemnly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, I do not know this Man: I never saw him before: I never knew that he Officiated in <hi>Bromley-College:</hi> I never heard him Preach in the Church there: He is a meer Stranger to me: He may have serv'd for the Chaplain of that College in King <hi>Iames's</hi> Time: But I was not then concern'd who Officiated there. He may have Preach'd in the Church, and I not have heard him: For about that time I was Clerk of the Closet, and was seldom or never at <hi>Bromley</hi> on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, by reason of my Attendance on the Princess <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> either at <hi>Whitehalt,</hi> or <hi>Windsor,</hi> or <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> or <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>

                  <p>My Lords, if any of your Lordships please to ask me any Thing, I shall answer with all Respect. But I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that I am bound to satisfie this sawcy Fellows Questions: Yet, because he has ask'd me so familiarly, touching my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with one Captain <hi>Lawe,</hi> I assure you, I know not any such Man in the World as Captain <hi>Lawe.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>But, my Lords, by this Person's Discourse I am induced to believe, he may be the <hi>Young,</hi> with whom the other Knave <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> pretended the last time that I held a strict Correspondence by his Means.</p>

                     <hi>Bishop of</hi> R.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, my Lords, because my Lord President, and some of the other Lords, were not here then, I must beg leave of those that were, that I may repeat what I then remembred concerning one <hi>Robert Young.</hi> Whereupon I recollected the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of what I had said, of a Letter I had received some Years since, dated at <hi>Newgate</hi>; from one of the same Name, who pretended himself to be a Clergy-man.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:41219:28"/>I added, It seems, my Lords, by his own Confession, this is the very same <hi>Young.</hi> But as I never saw him before he was in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> so I declare, upon the Faith of a Christian, I never saw, or heard from him since that Letter: However I am very glad you have him now: I make no doubt but he will be found in the end such another Villain as <hi>Blackhead</hi> was proved to be on <hi>Friday</hi> last.</p>
               <p>But, my Lords, said I, the Business that brought me to wait on you now, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to take that same <hi>Blackhead</hi> into farther Examination, and to inquire a little more into his Part in this <hi>Wicked Contrivance,</hi> whatever it is.</p>
               <p>My Lords, since I went to <hi>Bromley,</hi> my Servant Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> has had the good Fortune to retrieve the very Original Letter that <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> brought me from his Counterfeit Master Doctor <hi>Hookes.</hi> Then I deliver'd the Letter at the Table, and my Lord <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> read it aloud. And to shew with what a Treacherous Insinuation, and plausibility of Style it was written, to draw from me an
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41219:29"/>
Answer under my own Hand, I here set down the very Letter it self Word for Word.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Then I summ'd up what it has been said before, my Servants were ready to depose to that purpose: Concluding thus, My Lords, my Servants are attending without; I pray that <hi>Blackhead</hi> may be brought before them Face to Face, and that they may be admitted

to give in upon Oath, what they have to say concerning him.</p>

                     <hi>I was desired by Mr.</hi> Young, <hi>seeing the Association was not found by those, who Apprehended the Bishop, to go to</hi> Bromley, <hi>and try to recover it, that being the Original. I

did so, I came into the House before any of the Servants were aware, I went into the Parlour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen, and took the Paper out of the same place where I had put it, and deliver'd it again to Mr.</hi> Young.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I am very much surprized at all this. I cannot but admire the Wonderful Goodness of GOD, in this my extraordinary Deliverance. It appears by what this Fellow confesses, that this Forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Association was in my House, in a Flower-Pot, for many Days together: And that it was there at the very time I was seized on by your Lordships Order. For he says he put it there the second time he was at <hi>Bromley,</hi> which was a pretty while before I was in Hold: And took it not out till the third time, which was upon <hi>Whit-Sunday,</hi> the Ninth Day after I was under Confinement. And by a strange and marvellous Providence, that Parlour, where he says it lay so long in the Chimney, was never search'd or inquir'd after by the Clerk of the Council, or the Messenger.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>The other part of the House on the Left-Hand of the Hall, where my Study is, and Bed-Chamber above Stairs, and a Parlour
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41219:33"/>
and Drawing-Room below; all these they searched very accurately. Particularly, I well remember the Messenger thrust his Hand into the Flower-Pots in every Chimney: Which seem'd very odd to me then: But I now understand the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>At this, my Lord <hi>Sydney,</hi> my Lord <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> my Lord <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and some others of the Council, affirm'd, That they perfectly remember'd, both <hi>Blackhead,</hi> and <hi>Young,</hi> did especially direct them to give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to those who should be sent to take me to search all the Flower-Pots.</p>
               <p>By this time it was thought seasonable by the Lords to confront <hi>Blackhead</hi> with <hi>Young.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the mean while, the Counterfeit Association, being handed about the Table, was at length deliver'd to me. It was to this purpose, as much of it as, by a transient View, I could carry away in my Memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:41219:34"/>
                  <hi>That We whose Names were surbsribed, should solemnly promise in the Presence of GOD, to Contribute our utmost Assistance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards King</hi> JAMES'<hi>s Recovery of His Kingdoms. That to this end, We would have ready to meet Him at His Landing, Thirty Thousand Men well Arm'd. That we would seize upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Princess of Orange, Dead or Alive; And take Care that some strong Garison should be forthwith deliver'd into His Hands: And furnish Him with a Considerable Sum of Money for the support of His Army</hi>; or to this sense.

And in that Letter the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> was said to have the Paper in his keeping, which appears now to have been meant of the False Association's being in my Custody.</p>
               <p>Nay, my Lord, <hi>Sydney</hi> assur'd me, these very Impostors had brought him a Letter, supposed also to be Written by me to <hi>Young,</hi> which being but of ordinary Matters, he thought not worth the keeping, but he well remembred the Subscription of my Name was very like this in the Association, as well indeed it might.</p>
               <p>By this time <hi>Young</hi> being come into the Room, my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> spoke to him;</p>
               <p>Young, <hi>Look upon that Letter,</hi> (shewing him his own to me, under the Name of Doctor <hi>Hookes,</hi>) <hi>Do you know that Hand?</hi>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Young <hi>did give me that Paper, and directed me to leave it in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's House; and, if I could, to put it in a Flower-Pot in some Room; which I did, in the Parlour.</hi>

               <p>Upon this, the Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> the Lord <hi>Sydney,</hi> and some others of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, ask'd <hi>Young, Why then did you give us such express Directions, to send, and search the Flower-Pots, among other Places, in the Bishop's House?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I said nothing of Flower-Pots. I bid you take care that the Bishop's Person should be exactly search'd; because, when he went abroad, he carried the Association about him; when he was at home, he put it in some private place, for fear of surprize: Perhaps I might say in the Chimney.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>The Lords replyed, <hi>Nay, we all well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, you particularly mentioned the Flower-Pots.</hi>

                  <p>Young, <hi>When you perceived that the Persons sent to seize on the Bishop had mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Association, did not you then desire</hi> Blackhead <hi>to go a third time to the Bishop's House, and to take it out of the Pot, where he had laid it?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:41219:38"/>Which Saying of <hi>Young's</hi> could not but raise a general Smile among all the Company, they lifting up their Hands with great Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at his unparallel'd Impudence.</p>

                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Bishop of</hi> R.</speaker>
                  <p>I thought, my Lords, the last Time I was here, <hi>Blackhead</hi> was the most brazen Faced Fellow that ever I saw; but now I find this same <hi>Young</hi> to be a much viler Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant than he. This is so base a Suggestion against me, and so impossible for me to be guilty of, and I know your Lordships so little suspect it of me, that I need not make any Answer to it in my Defence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord President.</speaker>
                  <p>Young, <hi>Thou art the strangest Creature that ever I heard of; Dost thou think we could imagine, that the Bishop of</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester <hi>would combine with this thy Confederate, to have an</hi> Association <hi>written, with his own Hand to it, and then laid in his own House, in a Flower-Pot there? Which, if it had been found, must have endangered his Life: And we see it was the most remarkable good Fortune to him that almost ever hapned to any Man, that it was not found there.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>But <hi>Young</hi> still persisting, that he believed I had taken <hi>Blackhead</hi> off, they were both
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41219:39"/>
order'd to withdraw. And, I assure my Reader, that during this whole Examination, tho' <hi>Young</hi>'s Forgery was so evidently Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by the Confession of his own Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and Instrument, yet he behaved himself with a daring unconcernd Confidence, with a bold and erect Countenance, though it had naturally very much of a Villain in it. His whole Carriage indeed was such, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Discipline he has undergone for these divers Years; having so long been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a constant Inhabitant, together with his Wife, of many of the common Gaols in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; as you shall find before I leave them.</p>
               <p>But to make hast to the Conclusion of this Narration; the Lord President call'd for the Letter which <hi>Young</hi> had sent to me under the Name of <hi>Hookes.</hi> When his Lordship had viewed it deliberately, he ask'd also for the <hi>Association,</hi> and having compared them for some considerable time, he broke forth in these Words; <hi>Really, my Lords, it is a very great Providence, that this Letter, sent by</hi> Young, <hi>under the Name of</hi> Hookes, <hi>to the Bishop of</hi> Rochester, <hi>was preserved by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41219:39"/>
For this very Letter, and the Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, were both apparently Written by the same Hand; you may perceive there is no manner of Difference in the Writing, but only that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is written in a less Hand, as Letters are wont to be, and the</hi> Association <hi>in a greater, as a Publick Instrument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this the whole Board, one after another, had a perfect fight of both, and all applauded the Happiness of the Discovery: For it was as clear as Light to all that were present, that the Letters, and Words, of both, were of the very same Form and Figure.</p>
               <p>Particularly, my Lord <hi>Godolphin</hi> farther observed, and made it plan to them all, That the <hi>W</hi> in <hi>W. Cant.</hi> in the Subscription, was the very same Letter with the <hi>W</hi> in <hi>Whereas,</hi> which was the first Word of the Counterfeit <hi>Association.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my Part, I could not forbear Exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Great is Truth, and it will prevail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all this, I asking the Lords, Whether they had any farther Service to command me? And they saying <hi>No,</hi> I spoke these few Words.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I must always acknowledge,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41219:40"/>
That, next the Signal Providence of God, in so visibly protecting an innocent Man, your Lordships fair and honorable Way of Proceeding with me, in not shutting me up close in the <hi>Tower</hi> immediately upon my first Accusation; but in openly Confronting me with these Varlets, whil'st the Matter was fresh in my Memory; and in so strictly and impartially examining them now, has been the Principal Occasion, that my Innocency has met with a Vindication as publick and unquestionable, as I my self could have wished and prayed for. But still, my good Lords, I do again most humbly recommend to your Lordships, The Prosecution of this <hi>Black Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance</hi> to the Bottom, for the Sake of Truth and Justice, and for the Safety of every other honest Man, whose Lot this might have been as well as mine. I am sure your Lordships all believe, that there can be no greater Service to the Government, especially at this time, than to have such perjured In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, so plainly discovered, to be severely punished according to their Demerits.</p>
               <p>And so I took my Leave of their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:41219:40"/>This is the Substance of what I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as far as my Part goes in this Surprizing Adventure. As to the Account I promised of my Wicked Accusers, my Reader shall have it as fast as my weak Eyes will give me Leave to write it.</p>
