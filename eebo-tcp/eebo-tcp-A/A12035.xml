            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>LVcius Tarquinius</hi> (for his excessiue pride surnamed <hi>Superbus</hi>)
after hee had caused his owne father in law <hi>Seruius Tullius</hi> to
be cruelly murdred, and contrarie to the Romaine lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
not requiring or staying for the peoples suffrages, had possessed
himselfe of the kingdome: went accompanyed with his sonnes and other
Noble men of Rome, to besiege <hi>Ardea,</hi> during which siege, the principall
men of the Army meeting one euening at the Tent of <hi>Sextus Tarquini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the Kings sonne, in their discourses after supper euery one commended
the vertues of his owne wife: among whom <hi>Colatinus</hi> extolled the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
chastity of his wife <hi>Lucretia.</hi> In that pleasant humor they all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to Rome, and intending by theyr secret and sodaine arriuall to make
triall of that which euery one had before auouched, onely <hi>Colatinus</hi> finds
his wife (though it were late in the night) spinning amongest her maides,
the other Ladies were all found dauncing and reuelling, or in seuerall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: whereupon the Noble men yeelded <hi>Colatinus</hi> the victory, and
his wife the Fame. At that time <hi>Sextus Tarquinius</hi> being ensflamed
with <hi>Lucrece</hi> beauty, yet smoothering his passions for the present, departed
with the rest backe to the Campe: from whence he shortly after priuily
withdrew himselfe, and was (according to his estate) royally entertayned
and lodged by <hi>Lucrece</hi> at <hi>Colatium.</hi> The same night he tretcherouslie
stealeth into her Chamber, violently rauisht her, and early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
speedeth away. <hi>Lucrece</hi> in this lamentable plight, hastily dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the Campe for
<hi>Colatine.</hi> They came, the one accompanyed with <hi>Iunius Brutus,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Publius Valerius:</hi> and finding <hi>Lucrece</hi> attired in mourning
habite, demanded the cause of her sorrow. Shee first taking an oath of
them for her reuenge, reuealed the Actor, and whole maner of his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and withall sodainely stabbed her selfe. Which done, with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
they all vowed to roote out the whole hated family of the <hi>Tarquins:</hi>
and bearing the dead body to Rome, <hi>Brutus</hi> acquainted the people with
the doer and manner of the vile deede: with a bitter inuectiue against the
tyranny of the King, wherewith the people were so moued, that with one
consent and a general acclamation the <hi>Tarquins</hi> were all exiled, and the
state gouernment changed from Kings to Consuls.</p>
