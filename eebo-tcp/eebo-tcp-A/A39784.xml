            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Errors in Laws and Miſtakes in Governours, are ſo often Repreſented in Malicious Deſigns, That it is ſome times dangerous to Propall them. Yet when it is done with Diſcretion and Sobrietie, and in theſe Methods by which they are moſt probablie recommended, and in order to be redreſſed, without Reveange, it is not criminal. In this Method, the Propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the following Articles may preſume himſelf ſheltred, not only by his good Intentions, but alſo by the Nature of the things, and by the Judicature to whom he humblie directs his Opinion, with Submiſſion to either Approbation or Rejection: Laws cannot be otherwiſe corrected then by the Legiſlative Power; And there are few Laws ſo perféct, thô apparentlie expedient, when they were conſtitut, that yet may not beget prejudicial Conſequences; which may be occaſioned by change of Circumſtances in Perſons, and things: And no Example can better verifie this, than that of the Matter of Monie, which is one of the chief Inconveniencies mentioned in the following Papers.</p>
            <p>One of the great Ends of Parliaments, being to deliver the People from Inconveniencies; And the Laws, and true Priviledge of the People, allowing or rather requiring a Diſcreet Freedom, in diſcovering of Publict Evils, eſpeciallie in, and to Parliaments, what <hi>I</hi> now write, needs no Apology: If I be miſtaken, <hi>I</hi> ſhall be well pleaſed, that my Propoſitions may be rejected. But if I ſhall expoſe publict Inconveniencies, then I hope my propoſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies will be allowed, or better put in their place; which ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:31965:3"/>
likeways better pleaſe me: And becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when ſuch Matters are offered in Parliament, either time is wanting for Mature Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, or elſe it is beſtow'd perhaps on leſser Matters, if they be propoſed by greater Men; And ſome things contained in theſe Papers, may be weighty enough, and deſerve more Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than the ſhortneſs of a Sederunt can allow. And ſeveral things, will have a very far different View in ſerious Reflection, from what they had in a haſtie Glimpſe: Therefore I have Printed them, and Publiſhed them, for the Uſe of theſe Members of Parliament, who will beſtow a little of their time, to ſtudy the true Cauſes of our Evils, and to invite them to Redreſs what they ſhall be convinced of to be ſuch.</p>
            <p>I think few, if any, will deny that our Nation is at preſent under many Inconveniencies, ſuch as Profanity, Poverty, and Contempt, amongſt other Cauſes of the firſt, the Non-Execution of Paenal Laws by Inferiour Magiſtrates, the not Alimenting of the Beggars, who are neceſſarly indigent, and the licenſing of many Licentious ones who are not ſo; And a third Cauſe, the Vacancy of Numerous Churches, and their long Continuance in that State.</p>
            <p>As to our Poverty, amongſt many Cauſes I hint at theſe three, the Baſeneſs of Current Coyn, and to that Exceſs that it were ſufficient to depauperat the Richeſt Kingdom in <hi>Europe,</hi> in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its Product and Trade. <hi>2do.</hi> Our Luxurie, unſutable to our Religion, and unproportionable to our Fortunes. <hi>3tio.</hi> The Conſumption of our Eſtates Abroad and not at Home.</p>
            <p>And how neceſſarly muſt we be contemptible, whilſt in the great Concerns of Peace and War, we alwiſe intrude Our Selves into the Misfortunes of <hi>England;</hi> whilſt they never allow one Ray of their Proſperity to glance on Us. being alwayes under the Siniſttruous Influence of their State, but never under the Benign,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31965:3"/>
I am far from ſuppoſing or intending an Enumeration of all our Evils, and as far from thinking that I touch all the Cauſes: But although I cannot do much, yet my Dutie calls to do apart; And I leave the greater Burdens on Greater Men, and better Heads. And it will be ſome Satisfaction to me, if I contribute in the leaſt to any Amendment; And the loweſt of my Hope is, that what was undervalued by ſome, when <hi>I</hi> offered my private Thoughts on prior Occaſions, may be more noticed, if not more reſpected by the Body of the Parliament; And however, <hi>in magnis voluiſſe ſat eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the following Papers, I advance my Opinion for ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to remove Prophanitie, by planting of Churches: And where that is neglected, thereby to raiſe a Fond for entertaining of the Poor; For which End alſo, I offer ſome other Mediums, And for our Povertie, I expoſe the Miſchiefs of our Coin with the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and offers both my Opinion and my Wiſh, for Reforming our Luxury; And in Order thereto, to direct our Trade to its profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Subjects.</p>
            <p>If they be not digeſted in fit Method and Order, this may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, that having litlte ſhare in publick Truſt, I am not Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to it, in ſo much time, as thoſe are whoſe Province does oblige them to manage it: And I hope they will Supply all my Defects: But when at any time, what I have write<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> occur to my Thoughts, I beſtow that time to write it down; And for my Goodwill, all that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <head>A PROPOSITION For Remeding the Debaſement of COYNE IN SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>IT is evident that the Raiſing of the Denomination of the Standard of our Coyne above the Standard of <hi>England,</hi> by the Act of Parliament 1686. and what hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſaid Act, is not only expreſly contrair to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Contract betwixt the two Kingdoms, <hi>Anno</hi> 16—but is in it ſelf one of the great Cauſes of the Nations Poverty; For, by it all our Goods are ſold at an unperceaved Undervalue: in ſo far, that we own and receave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown (and ſo every Species of their Money proportionably) at 5<hi>ſh.</hi> 5<hi>d. ſterl.</hi> which is 8 ⅓ more than its Value in <hi>England,</hi> and when we give back that Crown to <hi>England,</hi> they will receave it only at 5<hi>ſh.</hi> So we give our Goods for 8 ⅓ leſs than we are aware of; and when we Buy, we looſe 8 ⅓ of what
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31965:5"/>
Money we pay in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coyne. I Know it's thought that the Raiſing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, &amp;c. will induce People to bring in many more of theſe Crowns, &amp;c. than other wayes they would do; which is a Miſtake: For, any who was to bring in 13 of theſe Crowns, to Buy <hi>Scots</hi> Goods, if the Crown did paſs at 5 <hi>ſh. sterline,</hi> needs only now bring 12 of them; becauſe, the 5 <hi>d.</hi> rais'd on each one, makes up the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. And ſo it is evident it occaſions a fewer Number of Crowns to be imported. And if it be ſaid, that yet it invites People to bring more 12 Crowns, becauſe 12 gain 1 to them, and ſo it will occaſion more of our Goods to be bought. This Thought creeps in on men who do not examine things; for, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The Evidence ſtill proves, that in Place of 13, there are but 12 imported. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It proves, in Place of 5 <hi>ſh.</hi> &amp; 5<hi>d.</hi> we get but real 5 <hi>ſh,</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The Merchand who needs our Goods will Buy what he needs, or ſo much of it as he knows of Mercat for, albeit his Crown were receaved at no more than 5 <hi>ſh.</hi> And albeit his Crown were taken at 5 <hi>ſh.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> He will buy no more than will anſwer his End, and ſuit his Mercat, 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. If Money be raiſed only to invite Merchands to buy greater Quantities of our Goods, we have an eaſier Medium for that End: <hi>viz.</hi> to Sell a Crowns worth at 4 <hi>ſh.</hi> &amp; 7<hi>d.</hi> and ſo the Merchand has our Goods cheaper by 5<hi>d.</hi> and by the rais'd Crown he hath no more. And as this is eaſier, ſo it is ſafer than the raiſing of Denominations, as will appear by the following other Miſchiefs of our raiſed Standard; <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The raiſing of Money, in one Species, hath naturalie obliged us to raiſe all other Coins proportionablie, not only our own, but all Forraign Coins; So that now, from whence ſoever Money is brought to buy our Goods, they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31965:5"/>
bring in 8 ⅓ leſs Money than they would bring in, were our Standard as formerlie. We alſo Sell all our Goods to every Nation or Perſon at 8 ⅓ leſs than they payed to us formerly, and whatever We buy from any forreign Place or People, we muſt add 8 ⅓ more of Money to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uy it than we did formerly; For as was demonſtrat in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, ſo it is as plain in the ordinary Dollar, for who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly payed at 58 <hi>d. Sterl.</hi> in <hi>Croſs-Dollars</hi> or <hi>Patacoons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to give Us 2<hi>d.</hi> to make up the 58<hi>d:</hi> But now he payes Us 58. and keeps his 2<hi>d.</hi> to himſelf. And in like manner, he who payed us 60 <hi>d.</hi> in <hi>Bank</hi> or ſome <hi>Imperial-Dollars,</hi> beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give Us a <hi>Bank-Dollar,</hi> and 2<hi>d.</hi> more, now he payes us 60 <hi>d.</hi> by the <hi>Dollar</hi> alone, and keeps the 2 <hi>d.</hi> So in <hi>Ducatons,</hi> he who payed us 74 <hi>d.</hi> behoved to add 4 <hi>d.</hi> to make up 74 <hi>d.</hi> Now the bare <hi>Ducatons</hi> pays 74<hi>d.</hi> and he Retains 4<hi>d.</hi> to himſelf.</p>
            <p>And as we loſs ſo much, by what the Importer of <hi>Money</hi> brings in, leſs than he would have done, had our <hi>Standard</hi> ſtood as it was formerly; ſo when ever we pay 58 <hi>d.</hi> to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner for his Goods, we muſt add 2 <hi>d.</hi> to the <hi>Patacoon,</hi> to make up 58 <hi>d.</hi> When we pay 60 <hi>d.</hi> we muſt add 2 <hi>d.</hi> to the <hi>Bank-Dollar.</hi> And when we pay 74<hi>d.</hi> to a forreigner, we muſt add 4 <hi>d.</hi> to the <hi>Ducatoon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, we will raiſe the Price of our Native Goods in proportion to what we want by the <hi>Coyn.</hi> The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Argument will appear, if you Reflect, that in the firſt place, before we raiſe our Goods, we are cheated, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till their price riſe, and riſe from this cauſe; for if the price riſe by other cauſes as by the ſcarſity of our Goods in other places, or other emergent cauſes; then the forreigner behoved to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>Money</hi> at the former <hi>Standart,</hi> and as much more alſo, as our Goods were more valued abroad, than formerly. but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31965:6"/>
this Solution refutes what was argued before for raiſing the <hi>Standard, viz.</hi> that of raiſing the Denomination, people were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to import <hi>Money,</hi> for if he muſt ſtill pay as much <hi>Money</hi> as he did formerlie, what Invitation does He get, from rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Denomination?</p>
            <p>To what's thus argued againſt raiſing the of the <hi>Standart,</hi> add theſe yet more Weighty Arguments;</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Money</hi> gives no more abroad by our raiſing its Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, So that <hi>Money</hi> imployed in Trade by <hi>Cambion,</hi> is in other places, eſpeciallie with all prudent Nations; The ſame it was, without any Alteration, by our raiſing it.</p>
            <p>So that, as leſs is brought in to us for our Goods, ſo we muſt ſend out the ſame in Value and more of our Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than we ſent out formerlie.</p>
            <p n="20">20. That <hi>Money</hi> is of no more uſe than dead uncoyned <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> unleſs it be imployed in Merchandice, Trade or Cambion.</p>
