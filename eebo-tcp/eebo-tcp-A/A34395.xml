         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving the care of the Publication of this Piece com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to my Charge, I thought, for the Good of the
Publick, to give them the knowledge of the following

            <p>THE <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> (ſo highly commended by

Aſthma's, Tabes,</hi> or <hi>Conſumption</hi> of the <hi>Lungs.</hi> Its
Doſe is from 10 to 20, 30, or 40 drops in a Glaſs of Sack.
This Noble <hi>Elixir</hi> is Philoſophically prepared, by <hi>John
Spire, Chymico Medicus,</hi> at four Shillings the Ounce.
Who hath, by his Labour and Study in the Chymical Art,
attained unto ſeveral ſecret Arcanums, (not vulgarly

a Woman learned beyond her Sex,
being very well skill'd in the <hi>Latin</hi>

well vers'd in all kind of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy;
who when ſhe had firſt
taken in the Principles of <hi>Cartes,</hi> and
ſeeing its defects, afterwards by
reading certain Writings of very
Ancient Philoſophy, ſhe obſerved
ſo many things, that ſhe wrote theſe
few Chapters for her own uſe; but
<pb facs="tcp:52717:3"/>
in a very dull and ſmall Character;
which being found after her Death
is partly tranſcribed (for the reſt
could ſcarcely be read) and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in <hi>Eatin,</hi> that thereby the
whole World might be in ſome

no leſs wonder at the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Paradox, than at the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
hereof in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dialect,
and the rather becauſe it is no vulgar
Theme, and conſequently above the reach
of vulgar Capacities, whom (leſt it ſhould
be more apt to diſtract than inſtruct) I
ſhould rather adviſe to rest ſatisfied with
what for the preſent they know, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to covet or condemn more than they
do, or are capable to apprehend: Yet, by
the way, let me adviſe thee to ſuſpend
<pb facs="tcp:52717:4"/>
thy cenſures, (which at first view, 'tis
probable, thou may'st be ſubject to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,)
as ſuppoſing the Doctrine herein

examination on all the particulars herein
inſiſted upon: For <hi>Aliquando mens
cogitat quae ratio non probat.</hi> As
to the Tranſlation it ſelf, as I hope none
but envious Criticks will be offended
thereat, ſo I ſhall endeavour, though
briefly, yet fully, to ſatisfie every impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and unprejudiced Reader, both as to
the Circumſtance, and principal Reaſon
inducing me hereunto, which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
Being ſome time ſince in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and in Conference with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
<hi>F. M. B. van Helmont,</hi> then
reſident at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> it ſo hapned
that I demanded of the ſaid <hi>Helmont,</hi>
if he had publiſhed, or did intend to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
any new Books of his own, or others
Works, who preſently directed we where
<pb facs="tcp:52717:4"/>
I might procure certain Books, publiſhed
by his Order, which accordingly I did;
two whereof were extant in <hi>Latin,</hi> the
other in <hi>Nether-Dutch;</hi> this being the
Works of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Counteſs (after a
brief peruſal) I have endeavoured to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
into an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stile, as familiar as
the Language would conveniently admit,
without ſome abuſe to the Author. One
Reaſon that led me to it, was the earnest
requeſt of a Friend; the other was, that
I did not doubt but this little Treatiſe
might happen into the Hands of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
and well-diſpoſed Perſons, who
(though not furniſhed with thoſe artificial
Helps and Advantages that Learning
uſually affords; yet nevertheleſs being
qualified by a natural pregnancy of parts,
by many ſerious Studies and deliberate
Thoughts of this or the like Nature) might
be competent Judges of ſuch Myſteries;
or that it might fortunately light into the
Hands of ſuch whoſe eminency of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:52717:5"/>
and maturity of Judgment, might
render them either willing to approve it,
or able to refute it, and that too with a
better <hi>Salvo</hi> of Divine Attributes than
is done in this Treatiſe. Now, wiſhing

not a certain Subſtance or Being diſtinct
from him; but only diſtinct Manners or
Properties of one and the ſame Subſtance;
and ſeeing this is that which ſome of the
Wiſeſt and moſt Judicious Chriſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
by the Word Trinity. If now we
ſhould neglect that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Phraſe of Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Perſons, which is a Stone of Offence
to <hi>Jews</hi> as well as <hi>Turks,</hi> and other People,
and indeed in it ſelf hath no ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
nor can be any where found in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
yet all would eaſily agree in this
point: For they cannot deny that God
hath Wiſdom, and an Eſſential <hi>Idea,</hi> and
ſuch a Word in himſelf by which he
knows all things; and when they grant
he giveth all Things their Being, they
will be neceſſarily forced to acknowledge
that there is a Will in him, by which he
can accompliſh and bring that into Act
which was hid in the <hi>Idea,</hi> that is, can
produce it, and from thence make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Eſſential Subſtance; and this alone
is to create, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eſſence of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Nevertheleſs the <hi>Idea</hi> alone doth
not give being to the Creature; but the
Will join'd with the <hi>Idea,</hi> as when a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52717:7"/>
Maſter-Builder conceives in his Mind the
<hi>Idea</hi> of an Houſe, he doth not build that
Houſe by the <hi>Idea</hi> alone, but the Will is
joined with the <hi>Idea,</hi> and co-operates
therewith.</p>

                  <p>THE Ancient Hypotheſis of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Seeing God was of all the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great and infinite Light, and yet
the chiefeſt Good: For this Reaſon he
would make Creatures to whom he might

                  <p n="2">2. He diminiſhed therefore (for the

3. This Vacuum was not a mere Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or <hi>Non ens,</hi> but a certain real Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Light, diminutively, which was
the Soul of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> called by the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
Adam Kadmon,</hi> which filled all that
whole Space.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Soul of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was united
with that whole Light of the Divinity,
which remained within that <hi>Vacuum,</hi> in a

with it made up one Subject.</p>

§. 6. What Time is, and how the
ſame cannot be in God:</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. FORASMUCH as all Creatures
are, and do exiſt ſimply, or
alone from him; becauſe God willed them
to be, whoſe Will is infinitely powerful,
and whoſe Commandment, without any
Inſtrument or Inſtrumental Cauſe, is the
only Efficient to give Being unto his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
Hence it neceſſarily follows, ſeeing
the Will of God is Eternal, or from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that Creation muſt immediately
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52717:9"/>
follow the ſaid Will, without any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Time: And though it cannot
be ſaid, that Creatures conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
are Co-eternal with God; becauſe
after this rate Eternity and Time would
be confounded together; yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Creatures, and that Will which
created then, are ſo mutually preſent, and
ſo immediately happen one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that nothing can be ſaid to come in
between; even as if two Circles ſhould
immediately touch each other: Neither
can we aſſign any other Beginning to
Creatures, but God himſelf, and his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Will, which is according to his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Idea</hi> or Wiſdom. Hence it follows
by Natural Conſequence, that Times from
the Creation are Infinite, and without all
Number, which no created Intellect can
conceive: How then can this be Finite
or Meaſured, which had no other begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
but Eternity it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. BUT if any one will ſay, Times
are Finite, then let us ſuppoſe the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of them from the Beginning, to be
about 6000 Years, (even as ſome do think
that the whole Age of this World, from
the Beginning, is of no greater Extent,)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52717:10"/>
or with others (who think, that before this
World, there was another inviſible World,
from whence this viſible World proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;)
let us ſuppoſe the Duration of this
World to be 600000 Years, or any other
Number of Years, as great as can be by
any Reaſon conceived: Now I demand
whether it could be, that the World was
created before this time? If they deny it,
they limit the Power of God to a certain
Number of Years; if they affirm it, they
allow Time to be before all time, which
is a manifeſt Contradiction.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. THESE things being premiſed it
will be eaſie to Anſwer to that Queſtion,
wherewith Numbers have been ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
perplexed: Whether Creation was
made or could be made from Eternity,
or from Everlaſting? If by Eternity, and
Everlaſting, they mean an Infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Times; in this ſence Creation was
made from Everlaſting: But if they mean
ſuch an Eternity, as God himſelf hath,
ſo as to ſay, Creatures are Equal or Co-eternal
with God, and to have no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Time, this is falſe: For both Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Times (which are nothing elſe
but ſucceſſive Motions and Operations of
Created Beings) had a Beginning, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52717:10"/>
is God or the Eternal Will of God. And
why ſhould it ſeem ſtrange to any one
that Times in their whole Collection or
Univerſality, may be ſaid to be Infinite,
when the leaſt part of Time that can be
conceived, contains in it ſelf a kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity?
For as there is no Time ſo great,
that a greater cannot be conceived; ſo
there is no time ſo ſmall, but there may
be a leſs; for the ſixtieth part of a Minute
may be divided into ſixty other parts,
and theſe again into others, and ſo <hi>ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. BUT the Infiniteneſs of Times
from the beginning of Creation may be
likewiſe demonſtrated from the Goodneſs
of God; For God is infinitely Good, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and Bountiful; yea, Goodneſs and
Charity it ſelf; an infinite Fountain, and
Father of Goodneſs, Charity, and Bounty.
Now how can it be, that this Fountain
ſhall not always plentifully flow, and ſend
from it ſelf Living Waters? And ſhall not
this Ocean perpetually abound with its
own Efflux to the Production of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and that with a certain continual
Stream? For the Goodneſs of God in its
own proper Nature is Communicative,
and Multiplicative, and ſeeing in him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52717:11"/>
is wanting, neither can any thing
be added unto him, by reaſon of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
fulneſs, and tranſcendent fertility:
And alſo ſeeing by the ſame reaſon he
cannot multiply himſelf, which would be
all one, as if we ſhould imagine there were
more Gods than one, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory:
Now it neceſſarily follows, that
he did give Being to his Creatures from
everlaſting, or Times without Number;
or elſe this Communicative Goodneſs of
God, which is his Eſſential Attribute, would
be ſomething Finite, and its Duration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of a certain Number of Years, than
which nothing is more abſurd.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. IT is an Eſſential Attribute of God,
to be a Creator, and ſo by Conſequence
God ever was a Creator, and ever will be
a Creator, becauſe otherwiſe he would be
changed. And therefore Creatures ever
were, and ever will be; but the Eternity
of Creatures is nothing elſe, but an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Times, in which they ever were,
and ever will be without end: Neither is
this Infiniteneſs of Times equal to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs
of God's Eternity; becauſe the
Eternity of God himſelf, hath no Times

preſent: He is indeed in Times; but not
comprehended of them. Although the

becauſe Time is nothing elſe but the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
Motion or Operation of Creatures;
which Motion or Operation, if it ſhould
ceaſe, Time would alſo ceaſe, and the
Creatures themſelves would ceaſe with
Time: Wherefore ſuch is the Nature of
every Creature, that it is in Motion, or
hath a certain Motion, by means of which
it advances forward, and grows to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

is no ſucceſſive Motion or Operation to a

two; to wit, his Wiſdom and Goodneſs,
that Indifferency of Will, which the
Schoolmen, and Philoſophers falſly ſo
called, have imagined to be in God, will
be utterly refuted, and wholly turned out
of Doors; which alſo they have impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called Free-Will; for although the
Will of God be moſt free, ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he doth in the behalf of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
he doth freely without any external
Violence, Compulſion, or any Cauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

doth of his own accord: Yet that Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of acting, or not acting, can by no

were an Imperfection, and would make
God like corruptible Creatures; for this
Indifference of Will is the Foundation of
all Change, and Corruptibility in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
ſo that there would be no evil in
Creatures if they were not changeable.
Therefore, if the ſame ſhould be ſuppoſed
to be in God, he muſt be ſuppoſed to be
changeable, and ſo would be like corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Man, who often doth a thing out of
his mere pleaſure, not out of a true and

relying on their Power, ſo that they can
render no other Reaſon for what they do,
than that it is their mere Pleaſure; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
any good Man of them that acts, or is
about to act, can render a ſuitable reaſon
for it; and that becauſe he knows and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
that true Goodneſs and Wiſdom
hath required him to do it, wherefore he
Wills that it be effected, becauſe it is juſt,
ſo that if he ſhould not do it he would
neglect his Duty.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. FOR true Juſtice or Goodneſs
hath in it ſelf no Latitude or Indifference;
but is like unto a certain right line, drawn

will be crooked or bending, and that more

Whence it is manifeſt, this Indifference of

               <p n="3">§. 3. HENCE therefore it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that it was not indifferent to God,
whether he would give Being to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
or no; but he made them out of a
certain internal impulſe of his Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodneſs, and ſo he created the
World or Creatures aſſoon as he could:
For this is the Nature of a neceſſary Agent,
to do whatſoever it can; therefore ſeeing
he could create the World or Creatures in
Infinite Times, before 6000 Years, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
60000 Years, or 600000, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence
it follows he hath done it; For God can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
do that which implies no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
but this doth not imply a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
if the Worlds or Creatures be
ſaid to have been or exiſted in Infinite
Times, before this Moment; even as they
are Infinite Times after this Moment: If
there be no contradiction in the latter, there
is alſo no contradiction in the former.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. THESE Attributes duly conſidered,
it follows, that Creatures were created in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52717:14"/>
Infinite Numbers, or that there is an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Worlds or Creatures made of God:
For ſeeing God is infinitely powerful, there
can be no Number of Creatures ſo great,
that he cannot always make more: And
becauſe, as is already proved, he doth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he can do; certainly his Will, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Bounty, is as large and extenſive
as his Power; whence it manifeſtly follows,
that Creatures are Infinite, and created in
Infinite Manners; ſo that they cannot be
limited or bounded with any Number or
Meaſure: For Example; Let us ſuppoſe
the whole Univerſality of Creatures to be
a Circle, whoſe Semi-diameter ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſo many Diameters of the Earth, as
there are Grains of Duſt, or Sand, in the
whole Globe of the Earth; and if the ſame
ſhould be divided into Atomes, ſo ſmall
that 100000 of them could be contained in
one grain of Poppy-ſeed: Now who can
deny, but the Infinite Power of God, could
have made this Number greater, and yet
ſtill greater, even to an Infinite Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?
Seeing it is more eaſie to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Power, to multiply the real Beings
of Creatures, than for a skilful Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
to make any Number greater and
greater, which can never be ſo great, but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52717:14"/>
that it may be (by Addition or Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation)
encreaſed <hi>ad infinitum:</hi> And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſeeing it is already demonſtrated, that
God is a neceſſary Agent, and doth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he can do: It muſt needs be, that
he doth multiply, and yet ſtill continues
to multiply and augment the Eſſences of
Creatures, <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
ſee <hi>Philoſoph. Kabbal. Diſſert. 1. Cap.
6. Diſſert. 3. C.</hi> 1. in <hi>Kabbal. denud.</hi> Tom.
1. Part. 3. Whence Creatures are rather
termed Indefinite than Infinite.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. ALSO by the like Reaſon is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that not only the whole Body or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
of Creatures conſidered together,
is Infinite, or contains in it ſelf a kind of
Infinity; but alſo that every Creature, even
the leaſt that we can diſcern with our Eyes,
or conceive in our Minds, hath therein ſuch
an Infinity of Parts, or rather entire Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that they cannot be numbred; even
as it cannot be denied, that God can place
one Creature within another, ſo he can
place two as well as one, and four as well
as two, ſo alſo eight as well as four, ſo that
he could multiply them without end, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
placing the leſs within the greater.
And ſeeing no Creature can be ſo ſmall,
that there cannot be always a leſs; ſo no
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52717:15"/>
Creature is ſo great that there cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a greater: Now it follows, that in the
leaſt Creature there may exiſt, or be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
Infinite Creatures, which may be
all of them Bodies, and after a ſort, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of themſelves, impenetrable one of
another. As to thoſe Creatures which are
Spirits, and can penetrate each other, in
every created Spirit, there may be ſome
Infinity of Spirits, all which Spirits may
be of equal extenſion, as well with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
Spirit, as they are one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for in this caſe thoſe Spirits are more
Subtile and Aethereal, which penetrate the
Groſs and more Corporeal, whence here
can be no want of Room, that one muſt
be conſtrained to give place to another.
Of the Nature of Bodies and Spirits, more
ſhall be ſaid in its proper place, this being
ſufficient to demonſtrate, that in every
Creature, whether the ſame be a Spirit or
a Body, there is an Infinity of Creatures,
each whereof contains an Infinity, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
each of theſe, and ſo <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. ALL theſe do greatly extol and ſet
forth the great Power and Goodneſs of
God, for that his Eternity is clearly ſeen
by the Works of his Hands; yea in every
Creature that he hath made: Nor can it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52717:15"/>
be objected, we make Creatures equal with
God; for as one Infinite may be greater
than another, ſo God is ſtill Infinitely
greater than all his Creatures, and that
without any compariſon. And thus indeed
the Inviſible Things of God are clearly

§. 7. BUT if they ſay, they do not ſhut
up God within this Finite Univerſe, but do
imagine him to exiſt in Infinite imaginary
Spaces, as well without as within it. To
this may be anſwered, If thoſe Spaces are
merely imaginary; certainly then they are
nothing but Fooliſh Fictions of the Brain;
but if they are real Beings, what can they
be but Creatures of God? Beſides, either
God Works in thoſe Spaces, or he doth
not: if he doth not, then God is not there;
for whereſoever he is, there he worketh;
ſeeing this is his Nature, that he muſt ſo
act, as it is the Nature of Fire to burn, or
of the Sun to ſhine: For ſo God perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worketh; and his Work is to Create, or
give Being to Creatures, according to that
Eternal <hi>Idea</hi> or Wiſdom which is in him.
According to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> God is Infinite,
whom they call <hi>Aenſoph;</hi> for that he is ſaid
to exiſt without the Space of the World,
becauſe the Creature could not contain the
Immenſity of his Light. See what is ſaid
in Annotations on the Firſt Chapter. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is he ſaid to exiſt in imaginary Spaces,
becauſe no place plainly agrees with God;
but he may be ſaid to operate there by his
ſimple activity: But whatſoever is wrought
in, and by the way of the Creatures, is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52717:16"/>
done by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who is not ſo Immenſe
as <hi>Aenſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">§. 8. BUT this continual Action or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, as it is in him, or proceeds from
him, or hath reſpect unto him, is one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
continual Act or Command of his Will,
neither hath Time or Succeſſion in it; nor
firſt, nor latter; but is together, and always
preſent with God; ſo that nothing of him
is either paſt or to come, becauſe he hath
not parts: But ſo far as he appears or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
in Creatures, he hath Time and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of parts: And though this may ſeem
very difficult to be comprehended, yet it
can be ſufficiently evinced by ſound reaſon:
And will not this plain and common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
following, a little help our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
herein? Suppoſe a great Circle or
Wheel to be moved by a Centre, whereas
the Centre always remains in one place,
even as ſome do think the Sun after this
manner to be moved about his Centre (by
ſome Angel or Spirit remaining in the
Centre) within the ſpace of ſo many days.
Now albeit the Centre moves the whole
Wheel, and cauſes a great and continual
Motion in the ſame; yet that always reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
neither is it in the leaſt moved: How
much more then is the ſame in God, who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52717:17"/>
is the Firſt Mover in all his Creatures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to all their true and appointed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet he is not moved of them? But
that in him which hath an Analogy or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with the Motions or Operations
of Creatures, is the Government of his
Will, which (to ſpeak properly) is not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becauſe every Motion is ſucceſſive,
and cannot have place in God, as is above
demonſtrated.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. BUT againſt what we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
(that the leaſt Creature conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
hath in it Infinite Creatures; ſo
that the leaſt Particle of Body or Matter
may be Infinite ways extended, and divided
into parts leſs, and yet ſtill leſſer, and
leſſer) ſome may frame this following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
That which is actually diviſible,
ſo far as an actual diviſion can any ways be
made, is diviſible into parts indiſcerpible;
but Matter or Body (to wit, that Matter
that is entire or compound) is actually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
ſo far as an actual diviſion can any
ways be made, therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I Anſwer,
this Argument labours under that fallacy
which Logicians call <hi>Compoſitiones non Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponendorum,</hi>
which is a Conjunction of
Words, or Terms, that imply a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
or abſurdity, and that appears in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52717:17"/>
this Term, actually diviſible, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
one and the ſame thing to be divided,
and not to be divided; for Actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
Diviſion, and Diviſible not Diviſion,
but only a capacity to be divided, which
is as abſurd and contradictory, as if one
ſhould ſay <hi>viſibly blind,</hi> or <hi>ſenſibly inſenſible,</hi>
or <hi>livingly dead;</hi> but if by the Terms
Actually Diviſible, they do not mean two,
but only one thing, to wit, that it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
really divided, or only diviſible, we
ſhall eaſily diſcover the Fallacy: For, Firſt,
if by Actually Diviſible, they mean nothing
elſe but that which is divided, in this ſence
I grant the Major, to wit, that that which
is really divided, ſo far as an actual divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
can any ways be made, is diviſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
parts indiſcerpible; but by the ſame
reaſon the Minor is falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that Matter
is divided ſo far as an Actual Diviſion can
poſſibly be made. But, Secondly, if by that
which they call Actually Diviſible, they
mean a thing only diviſible, or in which
there is a power or capacity to be ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided:
Now I deny the Major, to wit,
That that which is diviſible, ſo far as divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
can be made, is diviſible into parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerpible;
and beſides in this ſence, that
propoſition is merely Tautological, and a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52717:18"/>
needleſs repetition of the ſame thing, juſt
as this would be; whatſoever can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
out of its place, in as much as it
can be removed, may be removed to ſome
certain diſtance; but <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> may
be removed out of their place, in as much
as they may be removed, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> By
the ſame way of Argument may be proved,
that the Soul of Man conſiſts of a Finite
Number of Years only, in which it doth
exiſt, or hath a Being, and conſequently
that it is Mortal, and hath an end; to wit,
thus, that whoſe Time or Duration is
actually diviſible, ſo far as an actual divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
can poſſibly be made, ſhall have an
end, and is diviſible into a Finite Number
of Years; but the Time or Duration of the
Soul is actually diviſible, ſo far as an actual
diviſion can poſſibly be made, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
But if it be denied, that the Time of the
Soul (if it ſhould come to ſuch a diviſion
of Years) ſhall then have an end; but that it
is poſſible for it to re-aſſume another Time
after this Firſt, and ſo <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Now, I ſay
the ſame, which is, that Matter if it ſhould
come to ſuch a diviſion, may indeed have
an end of that diviſion; but yet may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of another diviſion after this Firſt, and
ſo <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> And here is to be noted,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52717:18"/>
when I ſay the leaſt Particle of Body, or
Matter ſo called, may be always divided
into parts, leſs, <hi>ad infinitum;</hi> ſo that no
actual diviſion can be made in any Matter,
which is not always farther diviſible, or
capable to be divided into leſs parts, and
that without end; yet I would not hereby
determine, what the Abſolute Power of
God will or can do; as ſome do vainly and
groſly diſpute; but only hint what the
Power of God probably may do, or will
do, ſo far as he operates in and with his
Creatures, to wit, in as much as in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
and Generations, as alſo in all
Reſolutions and Diviſions, in the Nature
of Bodies, or the Creature, he never divides
nor never can divide any Body into ſuch
ſmall parts, that each of theſe is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
capable of a farther diviſion; for the
Body of no Creature can ever be reduced
into its leaſt parts; yea, into ſuch that it
cannot be reduced back again, either by
the moſt ſubtile operation of any Creature,
or created Power: And this Anſwer may
ſuffice to our preſent purpoſe: For God
makes no diviſion in any Body or Matter,
but ſo far as he co-operates with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and therefore he never reduces
Creatures into their leaſt parts; becauſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52717:19"/>
then all Motion and Operation in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
would ceaſe; (for it is the Nature of
all Motion to wear and divide a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſubtiler parts;) for to do this would be
contrary to the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of
God; for if all Motion and Operation
ſhould ceaſe in any particular Creature,
that Creature would be altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
and uſeleſs in the Creation, and ſo
would be no better than if it were a mere
<hi>non ens,</hi> or nothing. But as was ſaid before,
God cannot do that which is contrary to
his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, or any of his
Attributes. [Mathematical Diviſion of
Things, is never made in <hi>Minima;</hi> but
Things may be Phyſically divided into
their leaſt parts; as when Concrete Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is ſo far divided that it departs into
Phyſical <hi>Monades,</hi> as it was in the firſt

of this Infinite Diviſibility of every thing,

as it were Springs and Fountains from

               <p n="3">§. 3. IN order to this Demonſtration
we muſt firſt conſider the Nature or Being
of God, the chieſeſt Being; and then the
Nature and Eſſence of Creatures, which
are to be compared one with another,
whence this middle Nature will immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcover it ſelf to us. The Nature and
Eſſence of God, as is ſhown in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chapters, is altogether unchangeable,
which not only the Holy Scriptures, but
alſo the Strength of Reaſon which God hath
indued our Minds with, ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares;
For if there ſhould be any Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in God, it muſt needs tend to ſome
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52717:23"/>
higher degree or meaſure of Goodneſs, and
then he would not be the Chiefeſt Good,
which is contradictory; for if any thing
advances to a greater degree of Goodneſs,
this wholly comes to paſs by reaſon of ſome
greater Being, of whoſe Vertue and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
it doth participate: But there is
no greater Being than God, and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
he is no way meliorated, nor can
become better than he is, much leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
which would argue an Imperfection;
therefore it is manifeſt that God, or the
Chiefeſt Being, is altogether unchangeable.
Now ſeeing the Nature of Creatures is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſtinct from the Nature of God, ſo
that there are ſome Attributes of God,
which are incommunicable to Creatures,
among which is reckoned Immutability:
Hence it neceſſarily follows that Creatures
are changeable, or elſe they would be God
himſelf: Moreover alſo daily experience
teaches us that Creatures are change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and do continually vary from one
State unto another: But there is a two-fold
Mutability, the one whereof hath a Power
in it of changing it ſelf either unto Good
or Evil; and this is common to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but not to the Firſt Begotten of all
Creatures; the other is only a Power to,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52717:24"/>
proceed from Goodneſs to Goodneſs. Here
is therefore a three-fold <hi>Claſſis</hi> or rank of
Beings: The Firſt whereof is that which
is wholly unchangeable: The Second
changeable only to Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that that
which in its own Nature is Good, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
yet better: The Third is that which
though it was in its own Nature indeed
Good; yet could be indifferently changed,
as well into Good, as from Good into Evil.
The firſt and laſt of theſe are Extreams;
and the ſecond is a Natural <hi>Medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, by which the Extreams are
united, and this <hi>Medium</hi> partakes of both
Extreams, and therefore is the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
and proper <hi>Medium;</hi> for it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
of the one Extream, <hi>viz.</hi> Mutability,
to wit, from Good to a greater degree or
meaſure of Goodneſs, and of the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream,
<hi>viz.</hi> that it is altogether unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
from Good into Evil; and ſuch a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
was neceſſarily required in the very
Nature of Things; for otherwiſe there
would remain a Chaſm or Gap, and one
Extream would be united with another,
without a <hi>Medium,</hi> which is impoſſible,
and repugnant to the Nature of Things,
as appears in the whole Courſe of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.
By the Immutability of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52717:24"/>
here we muſt underſtand that which is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
not that which is Natural. There be
ſome who object, Chriſt was tempted in
vain, if he was naturally unchangeable. See
<hi>Matth. 4. 3. 17, 18. Chap.</hi> 4. 15. There
are alſo more Arguments, merely Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical;
of which in <hi>Philoſophia Kabbal.
(Kabbal. denud.</hi> Tom. 1. Part 3. Diſſert. 2.
Chap. 1.) 13. are urged to prove that from
the Firſt Beginning, there ſlowed forth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one thing begun and perfected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
is alſo confirmed by the Authority of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Modern Philoſophers, together
with an Anſwer to the Objections made on
the contrary.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. THIS Middle Being is not to be
underſtood in ſo groſs a manner, as if it ſtood
in a Middle Place, between two Extreams,
as the Trunk of the Body is between the
Head and Feet; but is a <hi>Medium</hi> in reſpect
of its Nature, as Silver is between Tinn and
Gold, or Water between Air and Earth,
which are but groſs Compariſons in regard
of the thing it ſelf; neither can any one
ſuppoſe the Son to be ſuch a <hi>Medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and the Creatures, as though
God was not immediately preſent in all
his Creatures, and immediately filled all
things; for he immediately operates in all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52717:25"/>
things in a proper ſence: But this is to be
underſtood of that Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which Creatures have with God; ſo
that although God immediately operates
in all things, yet he uſes this <hi>Medium</hi> as
an Inſtrument, by which he co-operates in
his Creatures; becauſe it is, in regard of
its Nature, more near unto them; and yet
becauſe he is more excellent than all other
Productions, which we call Creatures, and
that too in his own Nature. Hence it is,
he is deſervedly called the Firſt Begotten
of all Creatures, and the Son of God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a Creature of God; and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
is rather a Generation, or Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from God, than Creation, if the Word
be taken in a ſtrict ſence; although, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the larger ſence and uſe of this Word,
he may be ſaid to be created or formed, as
the Scripture ſomewhere ſpeaketh of him:
But if the thing it ſelf be duly underſtood,
'tis needleſs to contend about Words: Yet
nevertheleſs a Man's Son is rather ſaid to be
begotten of him, than made or created by
him. Of an Houſe, or a Ship, built or made
by a Man, we do not ſay it is his Son, but
his Work; becauſe his Son is the Living
Image and Similitude of himſelf, which
cannot be ſaid of an Houſe or a Ship: So
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52717:25"/>
this firſt Production of God, <hi>ad extra,</hi> or,
<hi>to without,</hi> is more fitly and properly term'd
his Son than a Creature; becauſe this is
the Living Image of himſelf, and is greater,
and more excellent than all Creatures.
Now it follows that the Son himſelf muſt
be immediately preſent in all theſe, that
he may bleſs and benefit them. And ſeeing
he is that true <hi>Medium,</hi> between God and
the Creatures, he muſt needs exiſt within
them, that ſo by his Operation he may ſtir
them up to a Union with him: And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he is the moſt excellent Production
of God, made <hi>ad extra,</hi> or, <hi>to without,</hi> and
the moſt perfect and expreſs Image of him,
he muſt needs be like unto God in all his
Attributes, which without contradiction
may be ſaid to be communicated to him;
and ſo by conſequence he muſt neceſſarily
be Omnipreſent: Beſides, if he were not
preſent in all Creatures, there would whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remain a <hi>Chaſma,</hi> or wide Gap, between
God, and the Creatures where he was not,
which is abſurd.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. MOREOVER, as he is Partaker of
the Immutability of God, and the Mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Creatures, and ſo a <hi>Medium</hi> between
that, which is altogether unchangeable,
and that which is altogether changeable,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52717:26"/>
as partaking of both; ſo alſo he may be
ſaid to be a Partaker of Eternity (which
is proper to God) and Time, (which is
proper to Creatures;) and albeit it be ſaid
in the precedent Chapters, that nothing
interceded between Eternity and Time, or
between the Creatures, and the Will of God
which created them. Time and Creatures
are there to be taken in a larger ſence, <hi>viz.</hi>
with reſpect to all the Productions of God,
made <hi>ad extra:</hi> So that this Middle Being
is as well there comprehended as the reſt:
Neither can we conceive this Middle Being
to be before Creatures in Time, but only
in the order of Nature; ſo that indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Time ſtrictly taken hapned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Creatures, and the All-Creating
Power and Will of God that created
them.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. BUT if by Time, according to the
common ſignification of the Word, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
a ſuccedaneous increaſe or decreaſe
of Things, according to which they grow
and increaſe unto a certain pitch or period,
and then again fail from it, until they die
or are changed into another State or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Life; in this ſence it may be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
affirmed, that neither this Middle
Being, or any Creature perfectly united
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52717:26"/>
with the ſame, are ſubject to Time, or the
Laws thereof; for the Laws of Time reach
but unto a certain Period or Age; and
when that Period is compleated, then
thoſe things which are ſubject to Time
decay and are conſumed, and ſo die and
are changed into quite another <hi>Species</hi>
of Things, according to that old Saying
of the Poet.
<q>
                     <l>Tempus edax rerum, tuque invidioſa ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſtas</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And for this Reaſon Time is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Four Parts, according to the Age of a
Man living in this World, which is Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Youth, Manhood, and Old Age, even
until Death; ſo that all things which are
bounded with Time, are ſubject unto Death
and Corruption, or are changed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Species</hi> of things, as we ſee Water
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52717:27"/>
changed into Stones, Stones into Earth,
and Earth into Trees, and Trees into Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
or Living Creatures: But in this moſt
excellent Middle Being is neither Decay or
Corruption; nor to ſpeak properly hath
Death any place in him: He is a moſt
powerful and effectual Balſam, which can
preſerve all things from Death and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
which are joined to him or united
with him; ſo that here all things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
new, ſpringing up freſh and
green; here is perpetual Youth without
Old Age; and here is the Perfection of
Old Age, to wit, great increaſe of Wiſdom
and Experience without any imperfection
of Age. But when Chriſt came in the
Fleſh, and in that Body which he bare with
him from Heaven; (for every created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath a certain Vehicle, either Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial,
Aereal, or Aethereal, as this was:)
He took upon him ſomewhat of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and by conſequence the Nature of
all Things, (becauſe the Nature of Man
hath in it the Nature of all Creatures,
whence alſo he is called the <hi>Microcoſm;)</hi>
which Nature having aſſumed in Fleſh and
Blood, he ſanctified, that by that he might
ſanctifie all Things, and ſo was as that
little Leaven that changed the whole
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52717:27"/>
Lump. He deſcended then within Time,
and for a certain ſpace or period, of his
own accord ſubjected himſelf to the Laws
of Time, ſo as to endure great Torments,
even Death it ſelf; but Death did not long
detain him, for the Third Day he roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and this was the end of all his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
even of his Death and Burial, <hi>viz.</hi>
that he might Heal, Cure, and Redeem
his Creatures from Death and Corruption,
which came upon them by the Fall, and
ſo at length hereby put an end to Times
and elevate the Creatures above Times to
himſelf, where he abideth, who is the ſame
yeſterday, today, henceforth, and for ever,
without Decay, Death, or Corruption.
In like manner, in his Spiritual and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Appearance in Man, whereby he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
to Save, Heal, and Redeem the Soul,
he doth as it were, after a certain manner,
ſubject himſelf to a kind of Death and
Paſſion; and ſo for a certain ſpace ſubmits
himſelf to the Laws of Time, that he
might elevate the Souls of Men above
Time, and Corruptibility to himſelf,
wherein they receive Bleſſing, and grow
from one degree of Goodneſs and Vertue
unto another, <hi>in inſinitum.</hi>

§. 7. BY the ſame Reaſon, thoſe who
are come unto a perfect Union with Chriſt,
are mounted up into a Region or Sphere
of perfect Tranquility, where nothing is
ſeen or perceived to move or compel; for
although there exiſt the moſt ſwift and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
Motions; yet nevertheleſs becauſe
the ſame do ſo uniformly, ſo equally, and
harmoniouſly move without the leaſt
contrariety or diſorder, they ſeem altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to reſt, whereof many Examples may
be given in External Things: For indeed
there are two kinds of Motion, which to
our bodily ſight ſeem to want Motion, <hi>viz.</hi>
that which is exceeding quick and ſpeedy,
and that which is exceeding ſlow; ſo that
the middle ſort is only diſcernable by us.
Now under Time, and the Laws thereof,
may be comprehended not only the Earth,
and Earthly Things; but alſo the Sun,
Moon, and Stars, and all the viſible part
of the World, together with more that is
inviſible: So that after a long Tract of
Time, all thoſe Things may be plainly
changed into quite another <hi>Species</hi> of
Things, and that by the ſame order and
courſe of Divine Operation which God
hath placed in all Creatures, as a Law o<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are changeable. §. 2. How far this
Mutability may extend it ſelf, whether
unto the Beings of Things, or unto the
manner of their Exiſtence. §. 3. That
they are only Changeable in manner of
Exiſtence, and not in Eſſence. §. 4. That
there are but Three Kinds of Beings eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
diſtinct one from the other, viz.
God the higheſt, Chriſt the <hi>medium,</hi> and
the Creature the lowest. §. 5. That this
Distinction is very neceſſary, and keeps
us from falling into Extreams on either
Hand, whereof the one is <hi>Ranteriſm,</hi>
and the other groſs Ignorance, by which
the Glory of the Divine Attributes is
obſcured and darkned. §. 6. An Example
hereof. §. 7. The Justice of God most
gloriouſly appears in the Tranſmutation of
Things out of one Species into another.
§. 8. That when the Spirit of a Man,
through Impiety, ſhall change it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Qualities and Conditions of a
Beaſt, it is but Juſtice in God, that the
ſaid brutiſh Spirit ſhould enter into the
Body of a Beaſt, and there for a certain
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52717:29"/>
time be puniſhed. §. 9. How many and
diverſe are the depraved and wicked Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
concerning God, and how he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be in Men by thoſe corrupt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.
§. 10. Why the old World was
deſtroyed by Water, and why this is to be
deſtroyed by Fire, and that all Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are Medicinal. §. 11. That every
Creature is compoſed of Body and Spirit,
and how every Creature hath in it more
Bodies, and ſo likewiſe more Spirits,
under one general governing Spirit, which
hath the command over the reſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. THAT all Creatures in their own
Nature are changeable, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
between God and Creatures, duly
conſidered, evidently evinces, and the ſame
is by daily experience confirmed. Now if
any Creature be in its own Nature change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
it hath this Mutability, as it is a
Creature, and conſequently all Creatures
will have the ſame, according to that Rule:
Whatſoever agrees to any thing as placed
under this or that <hi>Species,</hi> agrees to all
comprehended under the ſame <hi>Species;</hi>
but Mutability agrees to a Creature (which
is the moſt general Name of that <hi>Species,</hi>
under which all Creatures are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,)
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52717:30"/>
and from thence it is manifeſt;
for otherwiſe there would be no diſtinction
between God and Creatures: For if any
Creature were of it ſelf, and in its own
Nature unchangeable, that Creature
would be God, becauſe Immutability
is one of his incommunicable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. NOW let us conſider how far this
Mutability may reach, or be extended;
and, Firſt, whether one Individual can be
changed into another of the ſame or a
different <hi>Species?</hi> This, I ſay, is impoſſible;
for then the very Eſſences of Things would
be changed, which would make a great
confuſion, not only in the Creatures, but
in the Wiſdom of God, which made all
Things: As for Example: If this Man
could be changed into that, <hi>viz. Paul</hi> into
<hi>Judas,</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> into <hi>Paul,</hi> then he that
ſinned would not be puniſhed for his ſin,
but another in his ſtead, who was both
Vertuous and Innocent; ſo then a Good
Man would not receive the reward of his
Vertue, but a Vicious Man in his ſtead:
But if we ſuppoſe one good Man to be
changed into another, as <hi>Paul</hi> into <hi>Peter,</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> into <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his own proper Reward, but <hi>Peter</hi>'s;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52717:30"/>
nor <hi>Peter</hi> his, but <hi>Paul</hi>'s, which would be
a confuſion, and unbecoming the Wiſdom
of God. Moreover, if the very individual
Eſſences of Things could be changed one
into another, it would follow, Creatures
were not true in themſelves; and ſo we
could not be aſſured, nor have any certain
knowledge of any thing; and then all the
inbred Notions and Dictates of Truth,
which Men generally find in themſelves,
would be falſe, and by conſequence the
Concluſions drawn from thence; for every
true Science, or certainty of Knowledge,
depends upon the Truth of the Objects,
which are commonly called <hi>Veritates Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectivae,</hi>
or <hi>Objective Truths:</hi> If therefore
theſe Objective Truths ſhould be changed
the one into the other, certainly the Truth
of the Propoſitions depending thereon
would be changed alſo; and ſo no Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
could be unchangeably true, no not
the moſt clear and obvious as theſe are;
the whole is greater than its part, and two
halves make a whole.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. THE Second Thing to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
is, Whether one <hi>Species</hi> of Things
can be changed into another? Where we
muſt diligently obſerve after what manner
the <hi>Species</hi> of Things are diſtinguiſhed one
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52717:31"/>
from another; for there be many <hi>Species</hi>
of Things, which are commonly ſo called,
and yet in Subſtance or Eſſence differ not
one from another, but in certain Manners
or Properties, and when thoſe Modes or
Properties are changed, that thing is ſaid
to have changed its <hi>Species:</hi> Now whether
or no this be not a certain manner of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
and not the Eſſence or Being of
the Thing it ſelf that is ſo changed? As
when Water indeed is not changed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
the ſame, and cold coagulates it,
which before was fluid: When Water is
changed into a Stone, certainly there is no
reaſon, why we ſhould here ſuppoſe a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
change of its Subſtance, than in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Example of Water turned into Ice.
And again when a Stone is changed into
ſoft and tender Earth, here is made no
change of its Subſtance; and ſo in all other
Mutations which we obſerve in Things,
the Subſtance or Eſſence always remains
the ſame, and there is only a change of
<hi>Modus</hi> or Manner; ſo that when a Thing
ceaſes to be after this manner, it then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to be after another manner. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the ſame Reaſons do prove, that one
<hi>Species</hi> eſſentially or ſubſtantially diſtinct
from another, cannot be changed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52717:31"/>
even as one Individual cannot be
changed into another: For the <hi>Species</hi> of
Things are nothing elſe but Individuals di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
or comprehended, under one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Idea</hi> of the Mind, or common Term
of ſpeaking: As a Man, inaſmuch as he is
a <hi>Species,</hi> comprehends under him all the
Individuals of Men; and a Horſe is a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
comprehending every individual
Horſe. Now if one Man cannot be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into another, much leſs can this Man
be changed into another Individual of a
differing <hi>Species:</hi> For Example: If <hi>Alexander</hi>
cannot be changed into <hi>Darius,</hi> he cannot
be changed into his own Horſe <hi>Bucephalus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. IN order to know how far the
Mutations of Things can reach, we muſt
examine how many <hi>Species</hi> of Things
there be, which as to Subſtance or
Eſſence are diſtinct one from another; and
if we diligently inquire thereinto, we ſhall
find only Three, as before was ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi>
God, Chriſt, and the Creatures, and that
theſe Three in reſpect of Eſſence, are really
diſtinct one from another, is already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
but there can be no Reaſon alledged
to prove, that there is any Fourth kind of
Being diſtinct from the other Three; yea,
a Fourth kind of Being ſeems wholly ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52717:32"/>
And becauſe all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in
the whole Univerſe may be ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
into theſe Three before-mentioned,
as into their proper and original Cauſes,
there is no neceſſity to acknowledge any
other, according to this Rule: (Which if
rightly underſtood, it is moſt true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain)
Beings are not to be multiplied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
neceſſity; for ſeeing the Three before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
remove all the Specifical Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in Subſtance, which poſſibly can be
conceived in our Minds; and ſo by theſe
alone is that vaſt and infinite poſſibility
of Things filled up: How then can there
be room or place found for a Fourth, Fifth,
Sixth, or Seventh Being? And that it is
performed by theſe Three is already before
demonſtrated; to wit, that whatſoever can
be in any wiſe called a Being, the ſame is
either wholly unchangeable, and ſuch is God
the Supreme Being, or is wholly change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<hi>viz.</hi> to good, or evil, and ſuch is the
creature or loweſt being, or that which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly
unchangeable, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of Evil, or
partly changeable, to wit, in reſpect of Good;
by which is underſtood Chriſt, the Son of
God; that Middle Being between God and the
Creatures; into what <hi>Claſſis</hi> or Rank therefore
ſhall we bring a certain Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52717:32"/>
or Seventh Being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is neither whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
changeable, nor wholly unchangeable; nor
partly changeable, nor partly unchangeable:
Beſides, he that ſuppoſeth a certain Fourth
Being, eſſentially or ſubſtantially diſtinct
from the three before-mentioned, overthrows
that moſt excellent Order we find in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality
of Things, to wit, that there is
not only one <hi>Medium</hi> between God and the
Creatures, but two, three, four, five, ſix,
or as many as can be ſuppoſed between
firſt and latter. Moreover, it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous
to ſound Reaſon, and ſo alſo to
the Order of Things, that as God is but
One, neither hath he two, three, or more
diſtinct Subſtances in him; and Chriſt but
one Chriſt, neither hath in him more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Subſtances, inaſmuch as he is the
Heavenly Man, and very Firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo
likewiſe the Creature, or whole Creation,
is but one only Subſtance or Eſſence in
<hi>Specie,</hi> although it comprehends many
Individuals placed in their ſubordinate <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
and indeed in Manner, but not in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
or Eſſence diſtinct one from another.
And ſo that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man, may in like manner be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of all Creatures, (who in their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
State were a certian <hi>Species</hi> of Man
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52717:33"/>
ſo called for their Excellencies, as hereafter
ſhall be ſhown;) to wit, that God made all
Nations, or Armies of Creatures, out of
one Blood: And certainly here the reaſon
of both is the ſame; for as God made all
Nations out of one Blood, to the end they
might love each other, and ſtand in a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Sympathy, and help each other; ſo
hath he implanted a certain Univerſal Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
and mutual Love in Creatures, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Members of one Body, and (as I
may ſo ſay) Brethren, having one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Father, to wit, God in Chriſt, or the
Word made Fleſh; and ſo alſo one Mother,
<hi>viz.</hi> that Subſtance or Eſſence alone, out
of which they proceeded, and whereof they
are real Parts and Members; and albeit Sin
hath in a wonderful Manner impaired this
Love and Sympathy, yet it hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
it.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. THOSE Three diſtinct Beings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned,
being granted, and no
more, which are wholly inconvertible the
one into the other, we ſhall tread in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
path, in the mid-way of Truth, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe grand Errors and Conſuſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Entity, both on the Right Hand and
the Left: For, Firſt, there are ſome, who
teach, that there is but one Being of all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52717:33"/>
Things, whereof the Creatures are real and
proper Parts, and theſe confound God and
the Creatures together, as though both
were but one ſingle Eſſence; ſo that Sin
and Devils would be nothing elſe but Parts,
or at leaſt Modifications of that Divine
Being, from whence do ariſe very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Conſequences. Although I would not
have it miſ-interpreted to thoſe who are
unwarily faln into this Opinion; yet I
would warn the Reader, that he may the
better conſider whereunto ſuch Principles
tend, and avoid their abſurdity. There are
others again who allow only two <hi>Species</hi>
of Things, <hi>viz.</hi> God the Supreme Being,
wholly unchangeable; and the Creature
the loweſt Being, wholly changeable; but
theſe do not duly conſider that excellent
Order by us above deſcribed, which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in all Things; becauſe elſe peradventure
they would have taken notice, that beſides
theſe Two Extreams, there is a certain
<hi>Medium,</hi> which is partaker of both, and
this is Jeſus that Chriſt, whom not only
the wiſer ſort of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo ſome
among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſo called, have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<hi>viz.</hi> maintaining that there is ſuch
a <hi>Medium,</hi> which they called by divers
Names, as <hi>Logos,</hi> the Son of God, the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52717:34"/>
Firſt Begotten of God, Mind, Wiſdom,
Heavenly <hi>Adam, &amp;c.</hi> So that ſome alſo do
call him the Eternal <hi>Medium:</hi> Which
Things, if duly conſidered, may not a
little conduce to the propagation and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of the true Faith, and Chriſtian
Religion, among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as
<hi>Turks,</hi> and other Infidel Nations; that is
to ſay, if it appears we are able to prove
that there is a Mediator between God and
Man; yea, between God and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
by as ſolid Reaſons as thoſe are,
which prove God to be a Creator: And
ſo they that believe on that, may be ſaid
truly to believe on Chriſt Jeſus, though
they ſhould not as yet have known, or
been convicted, that he came in the Fleſh:
For if they yield to the former, they will
undoubtedly be forced (if ingenious) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will or no, to grant the latter.
Others there are, who do as it were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
multiply the Specifical Beings of
Things, in their diſtinct Eſſences and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
Attributes; which wholly ſubverts
that excellent Order of Things, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſcures and darkens the Glory of the
Divine Attributes, ſo that it cannot ſhine
forth in its due Splendor and Brightneſs in
the Creatures: For ſo every Creature is ſo
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52717:34"/>
exceeding ſtraitly bounded, and ſtrictly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
and impriſoned within the narrow
limits of its own <hi>Species,</hi> that the Mutability
of Creatures is wholly taken away: Neither
can any Creature variouſly exerciſe any
greater participation of Divine Goodneſs,
or be advanced or promoted to any farther
perfection.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. ALL which we ſhall demonſtrate
by one or two Examples: And, Firſt, let
us take an Horſe, which is a Creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with divers degrees of perfection by
his Creator, as not only ſtrength of Body,
but (as I may ſo ſay) a certain kind of
knowledge, how he ought to ſerve his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and moreover alſo Love, Fear, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
Memory, and divers other Qualities
which are in Man: which alſo we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in a Dog, and many other Animals:
Seeing therefore the Divine Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Wiſdom, hath created every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
good; and indeed ſo, that it might
by continual augmentations (in its Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility)
be advanced to a greater degree
of Goodneſs, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> whereby the
Glory of thoſe Attributes do more and
more ſhine forth: And ſeeing ſuch is the
Nature of every Creature, that it is always
in Motion or Operation, which doth moſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52717:35"/>
certainly tend unto an higher degree of
Goodneſs, as the Reward and Fruit of its La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
unleſs the Creatures hinder that good
by a voluntary Tranſgreſſion, and abuſe of
that indifferency of Will which God placed
in them in their Creation. Now I demand,
unto what higher perfection and degree of
Goodneſs, the Being or Eſſence of an Horſe
doth or may attain after he hath done good
ſervice for his Maſter, and ſo performed
his Duty, and what is proper for ſuch a
Creature? Is a Horſe then a mere Fabrick
or dead Matter? or hath he a Spirit in him,
having Knowledge, Sence, and Love, and
divers other Faculties and Properties of a
Spirit? if he hath, which cannot be denied,
what becomes of this Spirit when the Horſe
dies? if it be ſaid it paſſeth into Life, and
takes upon it another Body of an Horſe,
ſo that it becomes a Horſe as before, which
Horſe may be ſtronger and fairer, and of
a more excellent Spirit than before. Very
well! But if he ſhall die, two, three, or
four times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall he always remain a
Horſe, though he be ſtill better, and more
excellent, by how much the oftner his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
revolves. Now I demand, whether the
Spirit of an Horſe hath in it ſuch infinite
perfection, that a Horſe may always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52717:35"/>
better and better <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and
yet ſo as to remain a Horſe? For as the
common received Opinion is, this viſible
Earth ſhall not always remain in the
ſame State, which may be confirmed
by undeniable Reaſons: Now it neceſſarily
follows, that the continual Generation of
Animals in theſe groſs Bodies ſhall ceaſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;
for if the Earth ſhall take on it another
Form, neither any longer bring forth Graſs,
Horſes and other Animals ſhall ceaſe to be
ſuch as they were before: And ſeeing they
want their proper Aliment, they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the ſame <hi>Species<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> yet nevertheleſs
they are not annihilated, as may be eaſily
conceived; for how can any thing be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated,
ſeeing the Goodneſs of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Creatures always remains the
ſame; and the conſervation or continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Creatures is a continued Creation,
as is generally granted, and already before
demonſtrated, that God is a perpetual
Creator; and as he is the moſt free, ſo alſo
the moſt neceſſary Agent: But if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that the Earth is unchangeable, as
before was ſaid, then it will come to paſs
that Horſes and other Animals, according
to their proportion, will be in like manner
changed with the Earth, and the Earth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52717:36"/>
to the ſame proportion, will again
produce or yield them Aliment or Food a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to their changed condition; then
I demand, Whether they ſhall always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the ſame <hi>Species</hi> under ſuch a
change? Or, whether there will not be
ſome difference between that State and this
As for Example: There is between a Cow
and a Horſe, which is commonly granted
to be Specifical. Again, I ask whether the
<hi>Species</hi> of Creatures do ſo infinitely one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
another, that an Individual of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Species</hi> may ſtill go forward in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and approach nearer unto another
<hi>Species;</hi> but yet never reach ſo far as to
be changed into that <hi>Species?</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
An Horſe in divers Qualities and
Perfections draws near unto the Nature and
<hi>Species</hi> of a Man, and that more than many
other Creatures; Is therefore the Nature
of a Man diſtant from the Nature of an
Horſe, by Infinite Degrees, or by Finite
only? If by Finite, then certainly a Horſe
may in length of Time be in ſome meaſure
changed into a Man, (I mean his Spirit;
as for his Body that is a thing evident:) If
infinitely diſtant; then unto any Man,
even one of the vileſt and baſeſt Nature and
Diſpoſition, may be attributed a certain
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52717:36"/>
Infinite Excellence in Act, ſuch as only
agrees to God and Chriſt, but to no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for the higheſt Excellence of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is to be Infinite only, in <hi>potentiâ,</hi> not
in <hi>actû;</hi> that is, to be ſtill in a poſſibility
of attaining a greater Perfection and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,
<hi>ad infinitum,</hi> though in can never
reach this Infinite; for how far ſoever any
Finite Being may proceed, yet that is ſtill
Finite, although there be no limits to its
progreſſion: As for Example: If we could
ever come to the leaſt Minute of Eternity,
or the like part of Infinite Duration, that
would not be Infinite, but Finite: Neither
do we herein contradict what is delivered
in the Third Chapter, of the Infiniteneſs of
Creatures; for it is not meant of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Goodneſs and Excellence, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
only of Multitude and Magnitude;
ſo that the one cannot be numbred, nor
the other meaſured, by the comprehenſion
of any created Intellect: Yet the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals
of Creatures, are always but Finitely
good, and Finitely diſtant, <hi>quoad Species,</hi>
or as to <hi>Species;</hi> and only potentially In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite;
that is, always capable of farther
perfection without end. As if there ſhould
be ſuppoſed a certain Ladder, which ſhould
be infinitely long, containing Infinite Steps,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52717:37"/>
yet thoſe Steps are not infinitely diſtant
one from another, otherwiſe there could
be no aſcenſion nor deſcenſion made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for Steps (in this Example) ſignifie
the various <hi>Species</hi> of Things, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be infinitely diſtant one from another,
or from thoſe which are next unto them;
yea, daily experience teaches us, that the
<hi>Species</hi> of divers Things are changed, one
into another, as Earth into Water, and
Water into Air, and Air into Fire or
Aether; and the contrary, as Fire into Air,
and Air into Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which yet are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<hi>Species</hi> of Things; and ſo alſo Stones
are changed into Metals, and one Metal
into another; but leaſt ſome ſhould ſay
theſe are only naked Bodies and have no
Spirit, we ſhall obſerve the ſame not only
in Vegetables, but alſo in Animals, like as
Barly and Wheat are convertible the one
into the other, and are in very deed often
ſo changed, which is well enough known
to Houſe-keepers in many Provinces, and
eſpecially in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where if Barley be
ſown Wheat ſprings up inſtead thereof;
but in other places more barren, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in Rocky Places, ſuch as are found
in <hi>Germany,</hi> if Wheat be ſown, Barley
cometh up, and Ba<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ley in other places
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52717:37"/>
becomes mere Graſs: And in Animals,
Worms are changed into Flies, and Beaſts,
and Fiſhes that feed on Beaſts, and Fiſhes
of a different kind, do change them into
their own Nature, and <hi>Species:</hi> And doth
not alſo a corrupted Nature, or the Body
of Earth and Water, produce Animals
without any previous Seed of thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals?
And in the Creation of this World,
did not the Waters at the Command of
God, produce Birds and Fiſhes? And did
not the Earth alſo at the ſame Command
bring forth Beaſts and Creeping Things;
which for that Cauſe were real and proper
Parts of the Earth and Waters? And as
they had their Bodies from the Earth, ſo
likewiſe they had their Spirits or Souls
from the ſame; for the Earth brought
forth Living Souls, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text
ſpeaketh, but not mere Corporeal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
wanting Life and Soul; wherefore
there is a very remarkable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Humane Creatures and Brutes:
Of Man it is ſaid, God made him after his
own Image, and breathed into him the
Breath of Life, and he became a Living
Soul; ſo that from hence Man received
his Life, that principal part of him, (by
which he is become a Man,) which is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52717:38"/>
really diſtinct from that Divine Soul or
Spirit which God breathed into him.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing the Body of Man was made
out of the Earth, which (as is proved)
had therein divers Spirits, and gave Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
to all Brute Beaſts; then unto Man,
no doubt, ſhe committed the beſt and
moſt excellent Spirits whom he was to
contain; but all theſe Spirits were of a
far inferiour <hi>Species,</hi> in regard of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Man, which he received from above,
and not from the Earth: And the Spirit
of Man ought to have Dominion over
theſe Spirits, (which were all but Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,)
ſo as to ſubdue them to himſelf, and
exalt them to an higher degree, <hi>(viz.)</hi> into
his own proper Nature, and that would
have been his true Increaſe and Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
for all this he ſuffered the Earthly
Spirits exiſting within him, to get Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over him, and ſo became like them;
wherefore it is ſaid, Earth thou art, and unto
Earth thou ſhalt return, which hath no leſs
a Spiritual than a Literal Signification.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. NOW we ſee how gloriouſly the
Juſtice of God appears in this Tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Things out of one <hi>Species</hi> into
another; and that there is a certain Juſtice
which operates not only in Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52717:38"/>
but in all Creatures, is moſt certain;
and he that doth not obſerve the ſame
may be ſaid to be utterly Blind: For this
Juſtice appears as well in the Aſcenſion
of Creatures, as in their Deſcenſion; that
is, when they are changed into the better,
and when into the worſe; when into the
better, this Juſtice diſtributes to them the
Reward and Fruit of their Good Deeds;
when into the worſe, the ſame puniſhes
them with due Puniſhments, according to
the Nature and Degree of the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
And the ſame Juſtice hath given a
Law to all Creatures, and written the
ſame on their Natures; and every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
whatſoever, that tranſgreſſeth this
Law, is puniſhed for it: But that Creature
that obſerves and keeps it, hath this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<hi>viz,</hi> to become better. So under
the Law which God gave to the <hi>Jews,</hi> if
a Beaſt killed a Man, that Beaſt was to be
ſlain; and the Life of Man is ſaid to be
required at the Hand of every Beaſt, <hi>Gen.</hi>
9. 5. And if any one had to do with a
Beaſt, not only the Man, but the Beaſt,
was to be ſlain; ſo not only the Woman
and her Husband did receive Sentence
and Puniſhment from God after their
Tranſgreſſion, but the Serpent alſo, which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52717:39"/>
was the brutiſh part in Man, which he
took from the Earth. God hath alſo put
the ſame inſtinct of Juſtice in Man, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Beaſts and Trees of the Field; for
whoſoever he be that is a good and juſt
Man, the ſame loves his Beaſts that ſerve
him, and taketh care of them that they
have their Food and Reſt, and what elſe
is wanting to them; and this he doth
not do only for his own profit, but out of
a Principle of true Juſtice; for ſhould he
be ſo cruel to them as to require their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and yet deny them their neceſſary
Food, then certainly he tranſgreſſeth that
Law which God hath written on his
Heart; and if he kills any of them, only
to fulfil his own pleaſure, he acts unjuſtly,
and the ſame meaſure will again be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
unto him; ſo likewiſe a Man that
hath a certain Fruitful Tree in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,
that proſpereth well, he dungs and
cleanſes the ſame, that it may wax better
and better; but if it be barren, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers
the ground, then he heweth it
down with an Ax, and burns it with Fire.
And ſo here is a certain Juſtice in all theſe,
as in all the Tranſmutation of Things from
one <hi>Species</hi> into another, whether it be
by aſcending from the Ignobler or Baſer
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52717:39"/>
unto the Nobler, or by deſcending into
the contrary, there may be found the ſame
Juſtice: For Example: Is it not juſt and
equitable, if a Man on Earth liveth a pure
and Holy Life, like unto the Heavenly
Angels, that he ſhould be exalted to an
Angelical Dignity after Death, and be
like unto them, over whom alſo the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
rejoice? But if a Man here on Earth
lives ſo wickedly and perverſly, that he
is more like a Devil raiſed from Hell than
any other Creature, if he dies in ſuch a
State without Repentance, Shall not the
ſame Juſtice tumble him down to Hell?
and ſhall not ſuch deſervedly become like
Devils, even as thoſe who led an Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Life are made equal with the Angels?
But if a Man hath neither lived an Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
nor Diabolical, but a Brutiſh, or at
leaſt-wiſe an Animal or Senſual Life on
Earth; ſo that his Spirit is more like the
Spirit of a Beaſt than any other thing:
Shall not the ſame Juſtice moſt juſtly cauſe,
that as he is become a Brute, as to his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
whilſt he hath left the Dominion of
his more excellent Part, to that Brutiſh
Part and Spirit within him, that he alſo
(at leaſt, as to his External Form, in bodily
Figure) ſhould be changed into that <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:52717:40"/>
of Beaſts, to whom he was inwardly
moſt like, in Qualities and Conditions of
Mind? And ſeeing this Brutal Spirit is
now become Superior and Predominant
in him, and holds the other Captive, is
it not very probable, when ſuch a
Man dies, that the very ſame Brutiſh Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ſhall ſtill have Dominion in him, and
carry the Human Soul with it whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it pleaſeth, and compel it to be
ſubſervient unto it? And when the ſaid
Brutiſh Spirit returns again into ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and hath now Dominion over that
Body, ſo that its Plaſtick Faculty hath the
Liberty of forming a Body, after its own
<hi>Idea</hi> and Inclination, (which before, in
the Humane Body, it had not;) it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
follows, that the Body, which
this Vital Spirit forms, will be Brutal, and
not Humane; for the Brutal Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
produce and form any other Figure:
Becauſe its Plaſtick Faculty is governed
of its Imagination, which it doth moſt
ſtrongly imagine to its ſelf, or conceive
its own proper Image; which therefore
the External Body is neceſſarily forced
to aſſume.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:52717:40"/>
§. 8. HEREIN the Juſtice of God mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly
appears, whilſt he aſſigns to every
Kind and Degree of Tranſgreſſion its due
and proper Puniſhment; neither doth he
ſentence every Sin and Tranſgreſſion to
Hell-Fire, and the Puniſhment due unto
Devils; for Chriſt hath taught the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
in that Parable, where he ſheweth
the Third Degree only is Doom'd to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Puniſhment, <hi>(viz.)</hi> if one ſay to his
Brother: Thou Fool!</p>
               <p>What can be here objected againſt the
Juſtice of God? If it be ſaid it doth too
much leſſen and diſparage the Dignity and
Nobility of Humane Nature, to ſuppoſe
the ſame with reſpect to Body and Soul,
convertible into the Nature of a Brute.
To this I Anſwer, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Maxim, <hi>Corruptio optimi fit peſſima,
The best Things by Corruption become the
worſt:</hi> For ſeeing Man by his voluntary
Tranſgreſſion hath ſo exceedingly pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
and brought down his own Nature
(which was ſo Noble) into a far worſe State
and Condition, that the ſame could wax as
vile and baſe in Spirit as the moſt unclean
Beaſt or Animal; ſo that he is become as
ſubject to Earthly Concupiſcences and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
as any Beaſt; yea, is become worſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52717:41"/>
than any Beaſt: What Injuſtice will this
be, if God ſhould alſo compel him to bear
that Image outwardly in his Body, into
the which he hath inwardly transformed
himſelf? Or, which thinkeſt thou is the
worſt Degeneration, to bear the Image
of a Beaſt in Spirit, or in Body? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
every one will ſay, to be like a Beaſt
in Spirit is far the greateſt Degeneration;
and there is not one, who is indued with
true Nobility of Mind, who will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that, to be like a Beaſt inwardly, is
worſe than to be like the ſame outwardly;
for to be one with him in Spirit, is far
worſe than to be one with him in Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Form and Figure of Body: But if any
one ſhall ſay this Puniſhment is too little
for ſuch a Man, who hath lived all his
Days a Brutiſh Life, if after Death he ſhall
only return to the State or Condition of
ſome Beaſt; let ſuch know, that the moſt
juſt Creator and Maker of all Things is
wiſer than he, and knows beſt what Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
is due unto every particular Sin;
who hath alſo ſo moſt juſtly and wiſely
diſpoſed all Things, that no Man that
lives carnally, and after the manner of
Beaſts, can enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven; and ſo alſo the Doctrine of Chriſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52717:41"/>
expreſly informs us, that all Sins are not
to be puniſhed with the pains of Hell:
<hi>And that where the Treaſure is, there is
the Heart alſo, and the Spirit of Man:</hi>
Alſo if a Man is joyn'd or united with any
Things, that then he becomes <hi>unum quid,</hi>
or one with the ſame; and that he that
cleaves to the Lord is one with him in
Spirit; and he that cleaves to a Harlot is
one Fleſh with her. Why then doth not
he that cleaves to a Beaſt, by the ſame
reaſon, become one with a Beaſt? And
ſo in all other caſes: For to whom any
one yields himſelf in obedience, the ſame
is his Maſter, ſo far as he obeys him; as
the Scripture ſaith. Moreover alſo it is
ſaid, <hi>With what meaſure ſoever ye mete,
the ſame ſhall be meted unto you:</hi> As if it
ſhould have ſaid, All Kinds and Degrees
of Sin, have their proper Puniſhments,
and all theſe Puniſhments tend to the
Creatures Advantage; ſo that Grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
over Judgment, and Judgment is
turned into Victory to the Salvation and
Reſtoration of the Creature: For ſeeing
the Grace of God is extended over all his
Works, Why ſhould we think God a more
ſevere and rigid Maſter to his Creatures
than indeed he is? Seeing this doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52717:42"/>
obſcure and darken the Glory of
the Divine Attributes; neither doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
a Love towards God, and an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Goodneſs and Juſtice in the
Hearts of Men, as it ought to be; but the
plain contrary.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. FOR that common Notion of
the Juſtice of God, that every Sin, how
ſmall ſoever it be, ſhall be puniſhed with
Hell Fire, and that without all end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
in Men an horrible <hi>Idea</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
concerning God; to wit, as though
he were a cruel Tyrant towards all his
Creatures rather than a Gracious Father:
But if the lovely Image of God was more
known unto Men, ſuch as indeed he is,
and manifeſteth himſelf in all his Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
to his Creatures; and if our Souls
could inwardly feel and taſt him, <hi>viz.</hi> as
he is Charity and Goodneſs it ſelf, and as
he inwardly reveals himſelf, by the Light
and Spirit of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our Lord, in the
Hearts of Men; then indeed, and not till
then, would Men come to Love God above
all things, and acknowledge him to be,
beyond all, the moſt Lovely, Juſt, and
Merciful, who may not puniſh all Sinners
with an equal Puniſhment.</p>

§. 10. AND moreover alſo, Why did
he drown the old World with Water, and
hath purpoſed to deſtroy this with Fire?
Such as was that of <hi>Sodom:</hi> but that he
would ſhow, that for diverskinds of Sin, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſorts of Puniſhment are to be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And that the old World was indeed
wicked, but that which is to be deſtroyed

               <p>But the different nature of theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
for which thoſe different puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are prepared, ſeem to conſiſt in
this; that the ſins of the old World were
more brutiſh and carnal, as the word of
God doth ſeem to point out, when he
ſaith, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive
with Man; becauſe he is become Fleſh;</hi>
that is, he is become perfectly Brutiſh or
Beſtial, by obeying the deſires of the
Fleſh: So that unleſs this Generation had

would have become Beſtial,
which Evil God would prevent, by drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them with the Waters, that by this
Puniſhment they might be reduced from
the Brutiſh Nature to the Nature of Men:
But the Sins of this World, which like <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>

their own Nature, to be more like the
Sins of Devils, than any thing elſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
by reaſon of Craft, Deceit, Malice, Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and Cruelty; and therefore their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Puniſhment is Fire, which alſo is the
Original Principle of thoſe Noble Spirits
ſo greatly degenerated; and ſo they ought
deſervedly by the ſame to be reſtored and
regenerated: For what is Fire, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
kind of imperfect Aethereal Subſtance
ſhut up in combuſtible Bodies? as we

hath its Original from Water. But as all
the Puniſhments, God inflicts on his
Creatures, have ſome proportion with
their Sins; ſo all theſe Puniſhments (the

Good and Reſtoration, and ſo are Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal,

§. 11. NOW therefore let us examine,
how every Creature is compoſed, and how
the parts of its compoſition may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the one into the other; for that
they have originally one and the ſame
Eſſence, or Being.</p>
               <p>In every viſible Creature there is a Body
and a Spirit, or <hi>Principium magis Activum,
&amp; magis Paſſivum,</hi> or, <hi>more Active and
more Paſſive Principle,</hi> which may fitly
be termed Male and Female, by reaſon of
that Analogy a Husband hath with his
Wife. For as the ordinary Generation of
Men requires a Conjunction and Co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Male and Female; ſo alſo all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
and Productions whatſoever
they be, require an Union, and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Operation of thoſe Two Principles,
to wit, Spirit and Body; but the Spirit is
an Eye or Light beholding its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Image, and the Body is a Tenebroſity
or Darkneſs receiving that Image, when
the Spirit looks thereinto, as when one
ſees himſelf in a Looking-Glaſs; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he cannot ſo behold himſelf in the
Tranſparent Air, nor in any Diaphanous
Body, becauſe the reflexion of an Image
requires a certain opacity or darkneſs,
which we call a Body: Yet to be a Body
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52717:44"/>
is not an Eſſential Property of any Thing;
as neither is it a Property of any Thing
to be dark; for nothing is ſo dark that it
cannot be made Light; yea, the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it ſelf may become Light, as the
Light which is created may be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Darkneſs, as the Words of Chriſt do
fully evince, when he ſaith, <hi>If the Light
which is in thee be darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. where
he means the Eye or Spirit which is in the
Body, which beholdeth the Image of any
Thing: Therefore as every Spirit hath
need of a Body, that it may receive and
reflect its Image, ſo alſo it requires a Body
to retain the ſame; for every Body hath
this retentive Nature, either more or leſs in
it ſelf; and by how much the perfecter a
Body is, that is, more perfectly mix'd,
ſo much the more retentive is it, and
ſo Water is more retentive than Air, and
Earth of ſome Things is more retentive
than Water.</p>
               <p>But the Seed of a Female Creature,
by reaſon of its ſo perfect mixture; for
that it is the pureſt Extraction of the
whole Body, hath in it a notable reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And in this Seed, as a Body, the
Male Seed, which is the Image and Spirit
of the Male, is received and retained, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52717:44"/>
with other Spirits which are in the
Female; and therefore whatſoever Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is then ſtrongeſt, and hath the ſtrongeſt
Image or <hi>Idea</hi> in the Seed, whether it be
the Maſculine or the Feminine, or any
other Spirit from either of theſe received
from without, tha<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Spirit is predominant
in the Seed, and forms the Body, as near
as may be, after its own Image, and ſo
every Creature receives his External
Form. And after the ſame manner alſo,
the Internal Productions of the Mind,
<hi>viz.</hi> Thoughts are generated, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Kind are true Creatures,
and have a true Subſtance, proper to
themſelves, being all our Internal Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and all of them Male and Female,
that is, they have Body and Spirit; for if
they had not a Body, they could not be
retained, nor could we reflect on our
own proper Thoughts; for every refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is made by a certain Tenebroſity
or Darkneſs, and this is a Body; ſo the
Memory requires a Body, to retain the
Spirit of the Thing thought on, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it would vaniſh as the Image in a
Glaſs, which preſently vaniſhes, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
being removed. And ſo likewiſe,
when we remember any Body, we ſee
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52717:45"/>
his Image in us, which is a Spirit that
proceeded from him, whilſt we beheld
him from without; which Image or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is retained in Some-Body, which is
the Seed of our Brain, and thence is
made a certain Spiritual Generation in
us: And ſo every Spirit hath its Body,
and every Body its Spirit; and as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<hi>ſc.</hi> of a Man or Beaſt, is nothing elſe
but an innumerable multitude of Bodies,
compacted together into one, and diſpoſed
into a certain order; ſo likewiſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of a Man, or Beaſt, is a certain innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
multitude of Spirits united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the ſaid Body, which have their
Order and Government ſo, that there is
one Captain, or Chief Governor, another
a Lieutenant, and another hath a certain
kind of Government under him, and ſo
through the whole, as it is wont to be in
an Army of Soldiers; wherefore the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are called Armies, and God the
God of Hoſts, as the Devil which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
the Man was called Legion, becauſe
there were many of them; ſo that every
Man; yea, every Creature, conſiſts of
many Spirits and Bodies; (many of theſe
Spirits which exiſt in Man) are called by

Body is a Spirit, and nothing elſe, neither
differs any thing from a Spirit, but in that
it is more dark; therefore by how much
the thicker and groſſer it is become, ſo
much the more remote is it from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

is only modal and gradual, not eſſential

becauſe the diſtinction between Body and

The reaſon hereof is taken, firſt, from the
Order of Things aboveſaid, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
only in Three. And that the worſt
of Creatures; yea, the moſt curſed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
after many and long-continued

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible
agrees as well to Spirits as to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
for that the difference is Gradual
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52717:46"/>
and not Eſſential; And that no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

               <p>NOW that I may more clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
that every Body is a
certain Spirit or Life in its own Nature,
and that the ſame is a certain intelligent

§. 1. THE firſt hereof ſhall be from the
Order of Things, before-mentioned,
which I have already proved to be but
Three; to wit, God the Supreme or
Chiefeſt, Chriſt the <hi>Medium</hi> or Middle,
and the Creature the loweſt in Order;
which Creature is but one Eſſence or
Subſtance, as to Nature or Eſſence, as is
above demonſtrated, ſo that it only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<hi>ſecundum modos exiſtendi;</hi> or, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the manners of exiſtence;</hi> among
which one is Corporiety; whereof alſo
there are many degrees; ſo that a Thing
may more or leſs approach to, or recede
from the State and Condition of a Body or
a Spirit; but becauſe a Spirit (between
theſe two) is more excellent in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Order of Things, and by how much
the more a Creature is a Spirit, (if at leaſt
wiſe it doth not any otherwiſe degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate)
ſo much the nearer it approaches
to God, who is the chiefeſt Spirit. Hence
a Body may always be more and more
Spiritual, <hi>ad infinitum;</hi> becauſe God who
is the Firſt and Supreme Spirit is Infinite,
and doth not nor cannot partake of the
leaſt Corporiety; whence ſuch is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Creature, unleſs it degenerates,
that it always draws nearer and nearer
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52717:47"/>
unto God in likeneſs: But becauſe there
is no Being, which is every way contrary
to God, <hi>(Viz.</hi> there is no Being, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
and unchangeably Evil, as God
is infinitely and unchangeably Good; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
infinitely Dark, as God is infinitely
Light; nor any thing infinitely a Body,
having nothing of Spirit, as God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
a Spirit, having nothing of Body;)
hence it is manifeſt that no Creature can
become more and more a Body, <hi>ad infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,</hi>
although the ſame may become
more and more a Spirit, <hi>ad infinitum;</hi> and
nothing can become infinitely more dark,
though it may become infinitely more
light: By the ſame reaſon nothing can
be Evil <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> although it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more and more Good <hi>ad infinitum:</hi>
And ſo indeed, in the very Nature of
Things, there are limits or bounds to
Evil; but none unto Good. And after
the ſame manner, every degree of Sin or
Evil hath its Puniſhment, Grief, and
Chaſtiſement annexed to it, in the very
Nature of the Thing, by which the Evil
is again changed into Good; which Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
or Correction, though it be not
preſently perceived of the Creature, when
it Sins, yet is reſerved in thoſe very Sins
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52717:48"/>
which the ſame committeth, and in its
due time will appear; and then every
Sin will have its Puniſhment, and ſo the
Pain and Chaſtiſement will be felt of the
Creature, and by that the Creature will
be again reſtored unto its former State of
Goodneſs, in which it was created, and
from which it cannot fall or ſlide any
more; becauſe by its great Chaſtiſement
it hath acquired a greater Strength and
Perfection; and ſo is aſcended ſo far above
that indifferency of Will, which before
it had to Good or Evil, that it Wills on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that which is Good, neither is any
more capable to Will any Evil. See <hi>Kab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.
denud.</hi> Tom. 2. Tract. ult. p. 61.
§. 9. p. 69. §. 21. and 70. §. 5. &amp; <hi>ibid.</hi>
Tract. 2. p. 157.</p>
               <p>And hence may be inferred, that all
the Creatures of God, which heretofore
degenerated and fell from their primitive
Goodneſs, muſt after certain periods be
converted and reſtored, not only to as
good, but unto a better State than that
was in which they were created: For Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Operation cannot ceaſe: And hence
it is the Nature of every Creature to be
ſtill in Motion, and always to change
either from Good to Good, or from Good
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52717:48"/>
into Evil, or from Evil again into Good;
and becauſe it cannot proceed infinitely to
Evil, for that there is no Infinite Example
thereof, hence it muſt neceſſarily return
or ſlide into Eternal Silence, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Nature of it. But if it be
ſaid, it goes into Eternal Torments, I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
If by Eternal thou meaneſt an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs
of Ages, which ſhall never ceaſe,
that is impoſſible; becauſe every Pain and
Torment excites or ſtirs up an operating
Spirit and Life in every thing which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers;
as we obſerve by continued Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and Reaſon teacheth us, that of
neceſſity it muſt be ſo; becauſe through
Pain, and the enduring thereof, every
kind of craſſitude or groſsneſs in Spirit or
Body contracted is attenuated, and ſo the
Spirit captivated or detained in that groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or craſſitude is ſet at Liberty, and
made more Spiritual, and conſequently
more Active and Operative, through ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
Now ſeeing a Creature cannot
proceed infinitely to Evil, nor ſlide down
into Inactivity or Silence, nor yet alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mere Eternal Paſſion, it inconteſtably
follows, that it muſt at length return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Good; and by how much the greater
its Sufferings are, ſo much the ſooner
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52717:49"/>
ſhall it return and be reſtored. And ſo
we ſee how a Thing (the ſame Subſtance
ſtill remaining) may be marvellouſly
changed in reſpect of the manners of its
Exiſtence; ſo that a certain Holy and
Bleſſed Spirit, or Angel of Light, could
by his voluntary Action, become a Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Curſed Spirit of Darkneſs; which
Change, or Metamorphoſis, certainly is
as great as if a Spirit were changed into
a Body. And if it be here demanded,
Whether thoſe Spirits became more Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
by their Tranſgreſſion, than they
were in their Primitive State before they
fell? I anſwer, Yes; but becauſe, as I
have already ſhown, that a Spirit is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Corporiety, <hi>Secundum majus &amp;
minus,</hi> or more and leſs; although not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely,
yet in many degrees. Hence it
is, they could remain for many Ages, and
have nothing of ſuch a Corporeal Craſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
as Things in this viſible. World have,
ſuch as are hard Stones, or Metals, or the
Bodies of Men and Women: For certainly
the Bodies of the worſt Spirits have not
ſuch a Craſſltude as any viſible Body, and
yet all that groſsneſs of viſible Bodies
came from the Fall of Spirits from their
Firſt State: And ſo the Spirits after long
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52717:49"/>
and various periods, could contract this
groſsneſs to themſelves, although they
could not together, and at one and the
ſame time fall into an univerſal groſsneſs,
ſo that the whole Body of any fallen Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ſhould be in all its parts equally groſs;
but ſome parts become groſſer and groſſer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the other Corporeal Parts of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
(which are its immediate Vehicle, and
wherewith it is moſt intimately united)
retain a certain Tenuity or Subtilty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the Spirit could not be ſo move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and active as otherwiſe it would;
and with theſe ſubtiler and more tenuious
Parts of the Body, the principal Spirit
(together with its miniſtring Spirits, ſo
many of them as it can poſſibly gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
departs out of thoſe thicker Parts
of the Body, which it leaves as ſo many
cadaverous Bodies, which are no longer
fit to ſerve the ſaid Spirits in thoſe Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
which they exerciſe in their preſent
State.</p>
               <p>And we may obſerve this departure of
the ſubtiler and ſtronger Spirits, out of the
harder and groſſer parts of the Body, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the more ſoft and tenu<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous, in a certain
Spirituous Liquor, which is congealed
with great cold, where the ſtronger Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52717:50"/>
(forſaking the harder Parts which are
outward, and chiefly expoſed to the cold)
do gather themſelves into the middle Part
of the Body, which is always ſubtile and
thin, ſo that one only drop of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
(which is not congealed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
ſtill liquid in the innermoſt Part
of the congealed Body) hath in it the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
force of all thoſe Parts which are
congealed; ſo that here is a two fold groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and hardneſs of Bodies, the one pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
and viſible to our External Senſes;
the other inviſible and impalpable, which
nevertheleſs is as groſs as the other, yea,
often groſſer and harder, which may be
truly perceived by the Internal Senſes,
although the External Senſes may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
thereof; for the inviſible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable
groſsneſs or hardneſs is that which
is proper to thoſe Bodies, which are ſo
ſmall, that our External Senſes cannot
perceive them, when nevertheleſs they
are really exceeding hard, yea, harder than
any Flint or Metal, which we can handle
with our Hands. And out of theſe hard
and ſmall Bodies, viſible Waters are for the
moſt part compoſed, although they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to us very ſoft, fluid, and tenuious,
by reaſon of the great Plenty of certain
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52717:50"/>
other ſubtile Bodies which continually
agitate, and move the ſaid hard Particles;
ſo that Water ſeems to our groſs Senſes to
be one thing Homogeneal, Simple, and
Uniform, although it conſiſteth of many
Heterogeneous and Diſſimilar or differing
Parts, more than many other Bodies;
and many of theſe Parts are exceeding hard
and ſtony, whence proceeds Gravel,
bubbling ſorth, and all other little Sands
and Stones, which have their Original
and Birth from the Waters ſpringing from
the bottom of the Earth; and when thoſe
little Stones, or ſtony Particles of Water,
grow into viſible Sand and Stones, the
ſame after ſome time do again loſe this
hardneſs, and become more ſoft and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious,
than when they belonged to the
Waters; for Stones do rot, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into ſoft Earth, and out of this
proceed Animals; ſo alſo Stones putrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
do often become Water again; but
this Water is of another <hi>Species</hi> than the
former, for one is petrefying, the other
mollifying; as it is obſerved that from
one Mountain in <hi>Helvetia</hi> two Kinds of
Water flow, one whereof being drunken
breeds the Stone, and the other is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
remedy againſt it; ſo that one Water
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52717:51"/>
is changed into a Stone, and the other
Water proceeds from that Stone, whilſt
it is in Corruption, and ſo it alters and
loſeth its former hardneſs: And ſo from
what hath been ſaid may the better be
underſtood, how the Heart and Spirit of
a Wicked Man may be ſaid to be hard
and ſtony; becauſe indeed his Spirit hath
in it a real hardneſs, ſuch as is found in
thoſe little ſtony Particles of certain Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
when on the contrary the Spirits of
good Men are ſoft and tender; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſoftneſs and hardneſs of Spirits, we
may alſo really feel, and every Good Man
doth as ſenſibly perceive the ſame, as the
external hardneſs of groſs Bodies is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by the outward touch; but ſuch
who are dead in their Sins, have not this
ſenſe of the hardneſs or ſoftneſs of Good
or Evil Spirits; and therefore they call
theſe only Metaphorical Speeches, when
indeed the Things are really ſo in a
proper ſence, and that without any Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. THE Second Reaſon, that creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Spirits are convertible into Bodies, and
Bodies into Spirits, I ſhall deduce from a
ſerious and due conſideration of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Attributes; from which, as from a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52717:51"/>
Treaſury of Inſtructions, may be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
the Truth of all Things: For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God is infinitely Good, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
his Goodneſs infinite ways to his
Creatures; ſo that there is no Creature
which doth not receive ſomething of his
Goodneſs, and that very largely: And
ſeeing the Goodneſs of God is a living
Goodneſs, which hath Life, Power, Love,
and Knowledge in it, which he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
to his Creatures, How can it be,
that any dead Thing ſhould proceed from
him, or be created by him, ſuch as is mere
Body or Matter, according to their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,
who affirm, that the ſame is
wholly inconvertible, to any degree of
Life or Knowledge? It is truly ſaid of one
that God made not Death, and it is as
true, that he made no dead Thing: For
how can a dead Thing depend of him,
who is infinitely Life and Charity? Or
how can any Creature receive ſo vile and
diminutive an Eſſence from him, (who
is ſo infinitely Liberal and Good,) that
ſhould partake nothing of Life or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
nor ever be able to aſpire to it, no
not in the leaſt degree? Hath not God
created all his Creatures for this end, that
in him they might be Bleſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enjoy
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52717:52"/>
his Divine Goodneſs, in their ſeveral States
and Conditions? But how can this be
without Life or ſenſe? Or how can any
Thing, that wanteth Life, enjoy Divine
Goodneſs? But we ſhall urge this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a little farther, The Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
are commonly and rightly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
into communicable, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable;
the incommunicable are,
that God is a Being, ſubſiſting by himſelf,
Independent, Unchangeable, abſolutely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
and moſt Perfect: The communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
are, that he is a Spirit, Life, and
Light, that he is Good, Holy, Juſt, Wiſe,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now there are none of theſe
communicable Attributes, which are not
living, yea Life it ſelf: And becauſe every
Creature hath a Communication with
God in ſome of his Attributes, now I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
In what Attribute dead Matter
hath it, or a Body that is uncapable of
Life and Senſe for ever? If it be ſaid, It
agrees with God in Entity, or that it is
an Eſſence, I Anſwer, In God there is no
dead Being, whereof he is or can be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker:
Whence, therefore, ſhall this have
its dead Eſſence? Moreover the Entity or
Being of a Thing is not properly an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
thereof; but an Attribute is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52717:52"/>
                  <hi>tale quid,</hi> or ſomething that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
or affirmed of that Being: Now
what Attributes or Perfections can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to dead Matter, which do analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically
Anſwer to thoſe which are in God?
If we diligently enquire thereinto, we
ſhall find none at all; for all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
are living; yea, Life it ſelf. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
ſeeing the Creatures of God, ſo
far as they are Creatures, ought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in ſome things to reſemble their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
now I demand, in what dead Matter
is like unto God? If they ſay again in
naked Entity, I Anſwer, There is none
ſuch in God or his Creatures: And
ſo it is a mere <hi>non ens,</hi> or nothing.</p>
               <p>But as touching the other Attributes
of Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> Impenetrability<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and Mobility; certainly none of
theſe have any place in God, and ſo are
not of his communicable Attributes; but
rather Eſſential Differences or Attributes
of Diverſity, whereby the Creature, as
ſuch, is diſtinguiſhed from God; as alſo
Mutability is of the Number of thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferential
Attributes, whence it cannot be
ſaid that Mutability is of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Attributes of God: And in like
manner, Impenetrability, Figurability,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52717:53"/>
and Mobility, do not pertain unto the
communicable Attributes of God; but to
thoſe only in which the Creatures differ
from him. And ſeeing dead Matter doth
not partake of any of the communicable
Attributes of God, we muſt certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the ſame is a mere <hi>non ens,</hi> or
nothing, a falſe Fiction or Chimaera, and
ſo a thing impoſſible. If they ſay, it hath
a Metaphyſical Goodneſs and Truth, even
as every Being is Good and True: Again;
I demand, What is that Goodneſs and
Truth? For if it hath no participation
with any of the communicable Attributes
of God, it will be neither Good nor True,
and ſo a mere Fiction, as before was ſaid.
Moreover, ſeeing it cannot be ſaid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
dead Matter doth any way partake of
Divine Goodneſs, much leſs can it be
ſhown, how it may be capable always to
acquire a greater Perfection, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi>
which is the Nature of all Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi>
to increaſe, and infinitely advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a farther Perfection as is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.
But what farther progreſs
in Goodneſs or Perfection hath a dead
Matter? Becauſe after it hath ſuffered In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Changes of Motion and Figure it is
conſtrained always to remain dead, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52717:53"/>
and if Motion and Figure contribute
nothing to the receiving of Life, then
certainly this is made never the better;
nay, is not in the leaſt degree promoted
in Goodneſs: For ſuppoſe this dead Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had undergone all Forms, and been
tranſmuted into all Kinds of Figures, even
the moſt regular and exact: What doth
this profit this Matter or Body, becauſe
it wants all Life and Senſe? So let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the ſame to have undergone Infinite
Kinds of Motion, from ſlowneſs to ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
Wherein, therefore, is it better, by
the way of its Intrinſecal Melioration?
For the Argument ſpeaketh of Intrinſecal
Melioration, which is ſuch a Melioration
as the Nature of the Thing it ſelf requireth,
and which is performed thereby; but a
mere dead Body, or Matter, requires no
kind of Motion or Figure; nor, in it ſelf,
is perfected more by one Motion, or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
than by another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to all Motions and Figures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
and by conſequence is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
or bettered by any of them. And
then what advantage will it have from all
theſe helps, if it always remain a dead
and impaſſible Thing.</p>

§. 3. MY Third Reaſon is drawn from
the great Love and Deſire that the Spirits
or Souls have towards Bodies, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
towards thoſe with which they are
united, and in which they have their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation:
But now the Foundation of all
Love or Deſire, whereby one Thing is
carried unto another, ſtands in this, That
either they are of the ſame Nature and
Subſtance with them, or like unto them,
or both; or that one hath its Being from the
other, whereof we have an Example in all
living Creatures which bring forth their
young; and in like manner alſo in Men, how
they love that which is born of them: For ſo
alſo even Wicked Men and Women (if
they are notextremely perverſe, and void of
Parental Love) do Love their Children,
and cheriſh them with a Natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the cauſe whereof certainly is this,
That their Children are of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Subſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> as though they
were Parts of them; and if they are like
them, either in Body, Spirit, or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
hereby their Love is the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed:
So alſo we obſerve that Animals
of one <hi>Species</hi> love one another more than
thoſe that are of a different <hi>Species;</hi> whence
alſo Cattle of one Kind feed together;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52717:54"/>
Birds of a Kind flock together; and Fiſhes
of a Kind ſwim together; and ſo Men ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
converſe with Men than with any
other Creatures: But beſides this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Love, there remains yet ſomething
of Univerſal Love in all Creatures, one
towards another, ſetting aſide that great
confuſion which hath fallen out ſince, by
reaſon of Tranſgreſſion; which certainly
muſt proceed from the ſame Foundation,
<hi>viz.</hi> in regard of their Firſt Subſtance and
Eſſence, they were all one and the ſame
Thing, and as it were Parts and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of one Body. Moreover, in every
<hi>Species</hi> of Animals, we ſee how the Male
and Female Love one another, and in all
their Propagations (which are not Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous,
and contrary to Nature) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
each other; and that proceeds not
only from the unity of Nature, but alſo
by reaſon of a certain eminent ſimilitude
or likeneſs between them. And both theſe
Foundations of Love between a Man and
a Woman, are expreſly mentioned in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis;</hi>
but that which <hi>Adam</hi> ſpoke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Wife, <hi>This is Bone of my Bone,
and Fleſh of my Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. pertains unto
the Unity of Nature; for ſhe was taken
out of him, and was a part of him, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52717:55"/>
therefore he loved her. Moreover alſo,
concerning Similitude, it is ſaid, there
was no Help found for him, or before his
Face, as it is in the <hi>Hebrew, (i. e.)</hi> among
all Creatures he ſaw not his like, with
whom he would converſe, until <hi>Eve</hi> was
made for him. But there is yet another
cauſe of Love, when Beings, that love
each other, are not one Subſtance, but
one gave Being to the other, and is the
proper and real cauſe thereof. And ſo it
is in the caſe between God and Creatures;
for he gave to all, Being, Life, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore he loves all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
neither can he not love them;
yea, at the ſame time when he ſeems to
hate and be angry with them, this his
Anger, and what proceeds therefrom, <hi>viz.</hi>
Puniſhments and Judgments, turns to
their Good, becauſe he perceiveth they
have need of them. So, on the contrary,
the Creatures which have not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,
and loſt all ſenſe of God, do
love him; and this is a certain Divine
Law, and Inſtinct, which he put in all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Creatures, that they might love
him, which is the fulfilling of the whole
Law: But thoſe Creatures which draw
moſt near unto God in ſimilitude or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52717:55"/>
do love him the more, and are the
more loved of him. But if it be thought
there is another principal cauſe of Love,
to wit, Goodneſs, which is the moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or powerful <hi>Magnet</hi> thereof, whence
alſo God is above all the moſt to be loved;
becauſe he is the beſt; which Goodneſs
is in ſome meaſure in Creatures, either
really or apparently; wherefore ſuch are
loved of their Fellow-Creatures: I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
It muſt be granted indeed, that
Goodneſs is a great, yea the greateſt
Cauſe of Love, and the proper Object of
it; but this Goodneſs is not a diſtinct
Cauſe from thoſe before laid down, but
is comprehended in them. Wherefore do
we call a Thing Good? But becauſe it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
really or apparently pleaſes us, for the
unity it hath with us, or which we have
with it: Hence it comes to paſs, that
Good Men love Good Men, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe;
for Good Men cannot love
Evil, nor Evil Men Good Men as ſuch;
for there is no greater ſimilitude than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Good and Good: For the reaſon
why we call or eſteem a Thing Good, is
this, that it benefits us, and that we are
made Partakers of its Goodneſs, and ſo
here the Firſt Cauſe of Similitude is ſtill
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52717:56"/>
Militant: So likewiſe, when one Thing
gives being to another, as when God and
Chriſt give Being to Creatures (as from
whom have every true Eſſence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,)
here is in like manner a certain Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude;
for it is impoſſible that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſhould not in ſome Things be like
their Creator, and agree with him in ſome
Attributes or Perfections.</p>
               <p>This being ſuppoſed a Touch-ſtone,
we ſhall now return to our ſubject matter,
<hi>(i. e.)</hi> to examine, whether Spirits and
Bodies are of one Nature and Subſtance,
and ſo convertible one into another?
Therefore, I demand, What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
That the Spirit or Soul ſo loveth the
Body wherewith it is united, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
departs out of it, that it has
been manifeſtly notorious, the Souls of
ſome have attended on, and been ſubject
to their Bodies, after the Body was dead,
until it was corrupted, and diſſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
duſt. That the Spirit or Soul gave a
diſtinct Being to the Body, or the Body
to the Spirit, cannot be the reaſon of this
Love; for that were Creation in a ſtrict
ſence; but this <hi>(viz.)</hi> to give Being unto
Things agrees only to God and Chriſt;
therefore that neceſſarily comes to paſs
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52717:56"/>
by reaſon of that ſimilitude they have one
with another, or ſome Affinity in their
Natures: Or, if it be ſaid, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Goodneſs in the Body, which moves
the Spirit to love it, certainly this Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
muſt neceſſarily anſwer to ſomething
in the Soul which is like it, otherwiſe it
could not be carried unto it; yea, let them
inform us what that Goodneſs in the Body
is, for which the Soul doth ſo ſervently
love it? or in what Attributes or Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
a Body is like a Spirit; if a Body is
nothing but a dead Trunk, and a certain
Maſs which is altogether uncapable of
any degree of Life, and Perfection? if
they ſay a Body agrees with a Spirit <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
entis,</hi> or in reſpect of Being; that is
to ſay; as this hath Being ſo that hath the
ſame; this is already refuted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Argument; for if this Being hath no
Attributes or Perfections wherein it may
agree with the Being of a Spirit, then it
is only a mere Fiction; for God created
no Naked <hi>Ens,</hi> or Being, which ſhould be a
mere Being, and have no Attributes that
may be predicated of it; beſides alſo, <hi>Ens</hi>
is only a Logical Notion or Term, which
Logicians do call <hi>Genus generaliſſimum,</hi> or
the moſt General Kind, which in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52717:57"/>
naked and abſtracted Notion of it, is not
in the Things themſelves, but only in the
Conception or Humane Intellect. And
therefore every true Being is a certain
ſingle Nature, whereof may be affirmed
ſuch and ſuch Attributes: Now what are
thoſe Attributes of Body, wherein it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
a Spirit? Let us examine the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Attributes of Body, as diſtinct from
a Spirit, according to their Opinion, who
ſo much diſpute, that Body and Spirit
are ſo infinitely diſtant in Nature, that one
can never become the other: The Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
are theſe, That a Body is impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable
of all other Bodies, ſo that the parts
thereof cannot penetrate each other; but
there is another Attribute of Body, <hi>viz.</hi> to
be diſcerpible or diviſible into parts: But
the Attributes of Spirit (as they define
it) are penetrability and indiſcerpibility,
ſo that one Spirit can penetrate another;
alſo, that a thouſand Spirits can ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
one within another, and yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
no more Space than one Spirit, More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that a Spirit is ſo ſimple, and one
in it ſelf, that it cannot be rent aſunder,
or actually divided into ſeparate parts.
If now the Attributes of Body and Spirit
are compared together, they are ſo far
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52717:57"/>
from being like one another, or having
any Analogy of Nature (in which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
the true Foundation of Love and
Unity doth conſiſt, as before was ſaid,) that
they are plainly contrary; yea, nothing
in the whole World can be conceived <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o
contrary to any Thing, as Body and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
in the opinion of theſe Men. For
here is a pure and abſolute contrariety in
all their Attributes; becauſe Penetrability
and Impenetrability are more contrary
one to another than black and white, or
hot and cold: For that which is black
may become white, and that which is
hot may become cold: But (as they ſay)
that which is impenetrable cannot be
made penetrable; yea, God and Creatures
do not ſo infinitely differ in Eſſence one
from another; as theſe Doctors make Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to differ from Spirit: For there are
many Attributes, in which God and the
Creatures agree together; but we can
find none, wherein a Body can any way
agree with a Spirit, and by conſequence,
nor with God, who is the chiefeſt and
pureſt of Spirits; wherefore it can be no
Creature, but a mere Non-entity or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
But as Body and Spirit are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in the Attributes of Penetrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52717:58"/>
and Impenetrability; ſo are they no
leſs contrary in Diſcerpibility and Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpibility:
But if they alledge, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Spirit do agree in ſome Attributes,
as Extenſion, Mobility, and Figurability;
ſo that Spirit hath Extenſion, and can reach
from one place to another, and alſo can
move it ſelf from place to place, and form
it ſelf into whatſoever Figure it pleaſeth,
in which caſes it agrees with a Body, and
a Body with it: To this I Anſwer: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the firſt, that a Spirit can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
(which yet many of them deny,
yea moſt, who teach that Body and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
are eſſentially diſtinct) yet the Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Body and Spirit, as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it, do wonderfully differ; for the
Extenſion of Body is always impenetrable;
yea, to be extended, and impenetrable,
as pertaining to Body, is only one real
Attribute propoſed in two Mental and
Logical Notions, or ways of ſpeaking;
for what is Extenſion, unleſs the Body
(whereſoever it is) be impenetrable of
its own proper parts? But remove this
Attribute of Impenetrability from a Body,
and it cannot be conceived any longer, as
extended. Moreover alſo, the Extenſion
of Body and Spirit, according to their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52717:58"/>
Notion, infinitely differ; for whatſoever
Extenſion a Body hath, the ſame is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
and eſſential to it, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for it to be more or leſs extended;
when nevertheleſs a Spirit may be more
or leſs extended, as they affirm; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be moveable and figurable, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſequential Attributes of Extenſion,
(for that a Spirit is far otherwiſe moveable
and figurable than a Body, becauſe a Spirit
can move and form it ſelf as a Body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not:)
The ſame Reaſon which is good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the one is good againſt the other alſo.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. BUT, Secondly, How can they
prove Impenetrability is an Eſſential At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
of Body; or that Penetrability is
an Eſſential Attribute of Spirit? Why
may not Body be more or leſs impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable,
and Spirit more or leſs penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as it may, and indeed doth happen
in all other Attributes? For, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> ſome
Body may be more or leſs heavy or light,
condenſed or rarefied, ſolid or liquid, hot
or cold; then why may it not alſo be
more or leſs penetrable, or impenetrable?
If it be ſaid, that in all thoſe other Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
we always obſerve, that a Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
impenetrable, as Iron when it is
heat red-hot, yet remains ſtill impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52717:59"/>
I Anſwer, I grant it may remain
impenetrable of any other Body of equal
thickneſs; yet may, and is entirely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated
of a more ſubtile Body, <hi>ſc.</hi> of the
Fire which hath entred into it, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
all its parts, whereby 'tis made ſo
ſoft; and if the Fire be ſtronger, begins
wholly to melt. But if, againſt this, they
Object, that the ingreſs of Fire into the
Iron, is not penetration in a Philoſophical
Sence, nor as they underſtand it, <hi>viz.</hi> as
though the Fire and Iron did poſſeſs but
one place, and ſo the one could be intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally
preſent in the other; becauſe it is
manifeſt to the contrary, that Iron (if it
be made candent or glowing hot) it ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
and acquireth a greater Bulk, than
when it is cold; and as it waxeth cold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
it returneth to its former dimenſion.
To this I Anſwer: If they mean ſuch a
Penetration, which we call Intrinſeck Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<hi>viz.</hi> that one Homogeneal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
ſhould enter into another, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of equal Dimenſions, and yet the bulk
or quantity not increaſed, that ſeems
wholly irrational: And it would be a
mere impoſſibility and contradiction to
grant ſuch an intimate Preſence in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which only agrees unto God and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52717:59"/>
Chriſt as Creators, whoſe Prerogative it
is to be intrinſecally preſent in Creatures;
whereas no Creature can have that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſeck
Preſence in its Fellow Creature,
becauſe then it would ceaſe to be a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and obtain one of the incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Attributes of God and Chriſt,
which is Intrinſeck Preſence. This
(I ſay) is primarily to be attributed to
God, and ſecondarily to Chriſt, in as
much as he is <hi>Medium quid,</hi> or a certain
<hi>Medium</hi> between God and Creatures, and
who as he is Partaker of Mutability and
Immutability, of Eternity and Time; ſo
he may be ſaid to be Partaker of Body and
Spirit, and conſequently of Place and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion:
For, in as much as his Body is of
another Subſtance than the Bodies of all
other Creatures, (as of whom he is the
neareſt Beginning to God,) it may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid, he is intrinſecally preſent in them,
and yet not ſo as to be confounded with
them. For to ſuppoſe one Creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally
preſent in another, ſo as to be
mingled and moſt perfectly united with
it, and yet its Quantity or Extenſion not
increaſed, that confounds the Creatures,
and maketh two or more to be but one:
Yea, according to this Hypotheſis, it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52717:60"/>
may be ſaid the whole Creation is reducible
into the quantity of the leaſt Grain or Duſt,
becauſe every part would be ſuppoſed to
penetrate another, and no greater extenſion
follow than of one Part. But if it be ſaid,
that only proves that Spirits may be reduced
into ſo ſmall a ſpace but not Bodies: Becauſe
Bodies are Impenetrable. I Anſwer, This
is but a begging of the queſtion, becauſe
they have not yet proved that Body and
Spirit are diſtinct Subſtances; which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they are, it follows that one Nature
is not more penetrable than the other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their ſence. And indeed it
ſeems very conſentaneous to Reaſon, that
as Times are each of them ſo extended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their due Meaſures and Extenſions, that
they cannot exceed thoſe Bounds, and ſo
cannot be intrinſecally preſent one with
another; as <hi>(ex. gr.)</hi> the Firſt Day of the
Week cannot be preſent with the Second
Day of the ſame Week; nor the Firſt
Hour of the Day with the Second; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the Firſt Minute of an Hour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with the Second Minute thereof; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſuch is the Nature and Eſſence of
Time, that it is ſucceſſive, and hath <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
extra partes,</hi> or parts, one without
another. When nevertheleſs God is really
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52717:60"/>
and intrinſecally preſent in all Times, and
is not changed, which cannot be ſaid of
the Creature, <hi>ſc.</hi> that that is preſent in all
or more Times, and not changed; for
the Creature is perpetually changed with
Times, ſeeing Times are nothing elſe but
the Motion or Change of the Creature
from one State or Condition into another.
And as it is in the caſe of Time, and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which are in Time, ſo alſo in the
caſe of Place, Bulk, or Quantity; for as
in God there is no Time, ſo alſo in him
there is no Bulk or Corporeal Quantity;
but in Creatures there is both Time and
Corporeal Quantity; becauſe otherwiſe
they would be either God, or Nothing,
which is impoſſible. For whatſoever
Quantity, Bulk, or Extenſion any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath, it retains the ſame, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which is of its own Eſſence; as it is

how a leſs Time is in a greater, <hi>ex. gr.</hi>
how ſo many Minutes are in an Hour, and
ſo many Hours in a Day; and one Hour
doth immediately touch the next, but
cannot be preſent in it, the ſame is to be
underſtood of the Creatures, in regard of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52717:61"/>
their Quantity or Bulk; for indeed one

but cannot be preſent in all its parts, but
only a leſs may be in a greater, and a

properly Penetration which agrees to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

is leſs groſs may penetrate another that
is more groſs; but two Bodies of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual

The ſame may be ſaid of Spirits
which have their degrees of more or leſs
groſſneſs, as Bodies have: Neither is there
any other difference between Body and

                  </gap>, which ſignifies a Spirit, ſignifies alſo
Air; and becauſe Air hath a very ſwift
Motion, all ſwiftneſs of Motion is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the Spirit in the moved Body:
Hence out of Popular Ignorance, when
in certain Bodies they perceived no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they termed them Dead, wanting
both Life and Spirit: But indeed there is
no where any ſuch Body that hath not
Motion, and by conſequence Life and
Spirit. Therefore every Creature hath
its due Quantity or Extenſion, which it
cannot exceed, and wherein alſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>Neither doth this hinder, that we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
how ſome very ſmall Body may be
extended into a Space a Thouſand times
greater than it had; even as Gun-Powder,
if it be ſet on Fire doth marvellouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it ſelf; for all this Extenſion is made
by Diviſion of Parts into Parts, ſtill leſs
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52717:62"/>
and leſs, which indeed do not fill all that
Space ſo great as it ſeems, when in the
mean while each part hath neither greater
nor leſſer Extenſion than it had before.
Suppoſing this, it muſt be concluded that
all Creatural Spirits, which are preſent in
Bodies, are either in the Pores of the ſaid
Bodies, or in certain Concavities made
there, as Moles make in the Earth;
or elſe they cauſe the ſaid Bodies to be
puffed up, and acquire a greater Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
as when Fire copiouſly enters Iron,
it notably puffs up and extends the ſame:
And although this Turgeſcency, or puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
up of Bodies, cannot be always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by our External Senſes; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
therefore be denied: For 'tis poſſible,
that a certain Body may conſiderably
grow or increaſe in its dimenſions, and
become intirely greater, and yet this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Magnitude may ſhun all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Obſervation; yea, it may be ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
that it cannot be expreſſed by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
<hi>ex. gr.</hi> let us ſuppoſe ſome Body,
whoſe Solidity or Cube may contain 64
Parts, and another whoſe Solidity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
100, where the root of the former
Body whoſe Cube is 64 is 4; ſo that the
ſide of that Body contains four Longitudes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52717:62"/>
of the Parts ſo divided; but the ſide or root
of the other Body, whoſe Cube is 100, can
be expreſſed by no Number; for it is
greater than 4, and leſs than 5, and no
Fraction can determine the ſame: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Bodies (as was ſaid) may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
ſwoln or puffed up, (if more Spirits
or ſubtiler Bodies enter into them,) and
yet ſo as that our groſs Senſes may judge
them not at all greater. Now that we
may come to the other Attribute, which is
ſaid to be of Body but not of Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi>
Diſcerpibility; if they underſtand it ſo;
that one only Body, even the leaſt that
can be conceived (if any ſuch Body can
be conceived) may be divided; that is
certainly impoſſible; for it is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in terms, and ſuppoſes every the
leaſt Body to be diſcerpible into leſſer
Parts. But if Body be taken individually
only for one ſingle Body, that is indiſcerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and that which we call the Diſcerpibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Body means only this, <hi>ſc.</hi> that we may
divide one Body from another, by placing
ſome Third Body between them; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this ſence Spirits are no leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpible
than Bodies; for although one
ſingle Spirit cannot become two or more
Spirits, yet more Spirits co-exiſting in one
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52717:63"/>
Body, are no leſs ſeparable one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Bodies; for however Bodies or
Spirits may be divided or ſeparated one
from another in the whole Univerſe, yet
they ſtill remain united in this ſeparation;
ſeeing the whole Creation is ſtill but one
Subſtance or Entity, neither is there a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi>
in it; How then can any thing be
ſeparated from it ſelf? I mean, from that
which is its proper Nature, as conſidered
Originally, or in its Beginning, or Firſt
Being? But as there is a General Unity
of all Creatures one with another, ſo that
none can be ſeparated from his Fellow-Creatures;
ſo there is a more ſpecial and
particular Unity between the Parts of one
particular <hi>Species:</hi> As when the Body is
divided, or torn aſunder, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
removed one from another unto a
certain diſtance, ſo long as theſe Members
are not corrupted, and changed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Species,</hi> they ſtill ſend certain ſubtile
Particles one to another, and to the Body
from whence they came, and the Body
ſends the like unto them, (which we call
Spirits, and Bodies, or Spirits, for they
are either,) by means whereof the Parts
and Members ſo apparently ſeparated, ſtill
retain a certain real Unity and Sympathy,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52717:63"/>
as is manifeſt from ſundry Examples; and
eſpecially the two following: The Firſt
of which is this: A certain Man wanting
a Noſe, ordered one to be made for him
out of the Fleſh of another Man, which
being vitally agglutinated, (as a Scion or
Graft is united with the Trunk of the
Tree into which it is put;) when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man died, and his Body corrupted,
this Noſe was likewiſe corrupted, and fell
from the Body of this living Man. The
Second Example is of a Man whoſe Leg
was cut off; which Leg being removed
ſome conſiderable diſtance from the reſt
of the Body, when a certain Chirurgeon
cut it, this Man complained of Pains, and
ſhowed in what part the ſaid Leg was
wounded, which manifeſtly proves that
there is a certain Union of Parts, though
ſeparated at a great diſtance one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
And ſo alſo Individuals of one
<hi>Species,</hi> or ſuch who have a ſingular Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in <hi>Specie,</hi> have a Union one with
another, although locally diſtant, which
is yet more manifeſt in Humane Kind:
For if two Men intirely love one another,
they are by this love ſo united, that no
diſtance of place can divide or ſeparate
them; for they are preſent (one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother)
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52717:64"/>
in Spirit; ſo that there paſſeth a
continual Efflux, or Emanation of Spirits,
from the one to the other, whereby they
are bound together, and united as with
Chains: And ſo whatſoever a Man loves,
whether it be Man or Beaſt, whether a
Tree, or whether Silver or Gold, he is
united with the ſame, and his Spirit paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
into that very Thing; and here is
to be obſerved, that though the Spirit of
Man is commonly ſpoken in the Singular,
as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it were but one Thing; yet
the ſaid Spirit is a certain compoſition of
more, yea innumerable Spirits; as the
Body is a compoſition of more Bodies, and
hath a certain Order and Government
in all its Parts, much more the Spirit
which is a great Army of Spirits, wherein
there are diſtinct Offices under one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Spirit. And ſo from hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that Impenetrability and Indiſcerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
are not more Eſſential Attributes
of Body, than of Spirit; becauſe in one
ſence they agree unto either, in another
ſence unto neither.</p>
               <p>But againſt this Infiniteneſs of Spirits
in every Spirit, and Infiniteneſs of Bodies
in every Body, may be objected that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
God made all Things in Number,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52717:64"/>
Weight, and Meaſure; wherefore there
cannot be an infinite multitude of Spirits
in one Man, nor an innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Bodies in one Body? But I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that the infiniteneſs or innumerabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Spirits, and Bodies is only to be
underſtood in reſpect of the Creatures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſo that they cannot be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
nor the outward Extenſion of Body
and Spirit (that may happen in them)
be meaſured by the knowledge of any
Creature. But that God hath perfectly
known the Number and Meaſure of all
Creatures is freely granted. And if God
made all Things in Number, Weight, and
Meaſure; then certainly every Creature
will have its Number, Weight, and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and by conſequence we cannot ſay
of any Creature, that it is but one ſingle
Thing, becauſe it is a Number, and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is a multitude, or more than one; and
indeed the Nature of a Creature is ſuch,
that the ſame cannot be merely one ſingle
Thing, in caſe it ought to act or do
ſomething, and ſo enjoy that Goodneſs
which is prepared for it by its Creator:
For <hi>(ex. gr.)</hi> let us ſuppoſe but one Atom
to be ſeparated from its Fellow-Creatures,
What can that do to perfect it ſelf, or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52717:65"/>
make it ſelf greater or better? What can
it ſee, hear, taſte, or feel, either from
within or without? It cannot have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Motion; becauſe every Motion hath
at leaſt two Terms or Extreams, <hi>viz.
Terminus à quo,</hi> and <hi>Terminus ad quem;</hi>
or, <hi>the Term from which,</hi> and <hi>the Term
to which:</hi> And ſeeing this is but one Atom
or Centre, certainly it cannot have any
Motion within it ſelf, <hi>è Termino à quo, &amp; ad
quem;</hi> and conſequently, ſeeing it cannot
hear, ſee, taſte, or feel, <hi>ab intra,</hi> or, <hi>from
within,</hi> it cannot have it from other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>ab extra,</hi> or, <hi>from without;</hi> for if
it ought to ſee, hear, feel, or taſte any other
Creature, it is required to receive the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of this Creature within it ſelf, which
it cannot do, becauſe it is an Atom, and
an Atom is ſo ſmall that it can receive
nothing within it: For as the Organs of
the external Senſes are compoſed of more
parts; ſo alſo are the Organs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
and conſequently all Knowledge
requires variety or multitude, which is
the Subject or Receptacle of it: I mean all
Creatural Knowledge, where Knowledge
is received or excited from known Things
or Objects, (whereas the Knowledge
of God is not received or excited by
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52717:65"/>
Creatures, but is originally in and from
himſelf.) Seeing, therefore, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of our Knowledge are various, and
every Object ſends its Image into us, and
that Image is a real Being, it follows we
have many Images in us, which cannot
be all received in an Atom, but have need
of their diſtinct Places in us, in their
diſtinct Forms and Figures; otherwiſe
there would not only follow a confuſion,
but many Things would be preſent one
with another without any Extenſion,
which is repugnant to the Nature of a
Creature. And although the Objects
of our Knowledge are many; as for
Example, I am manifold, who receive ſo
many Images from thoſe Objects; yet
from thence it doth not follow, becauſe
I who know ſomething am manifold, that
therefore I ought to behold one Object
as if it was many, ſo that ſeeing one
Man I ſhould ſee many; for when many
Men ſee one Man they do not behold
him as many Men, but as one Man only:
So when I look up and behold ſomething
with both my Eyes (unleſs peradventure
there be any confuſion in my ſight) they
do not ſeem to me as two, but one; and
if I could behold ſomething with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52717:66"/>
Eyes, as I do with two, certainly
that Thing, whether an Horſe or a Man,
would not ſeem otherwiſe to me than one
alone. Hence appears to us a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
between God and Creatures; for
he is One, and this is his Perfection, that
he hath need of nothing without him:
But a Creature, becauſe it needs the
aſſiſtance of its Fellow-Creatures, ought
to be manifold, that it may receive this
aſſiſtance; for that which receives ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is nouriſhed by the ſame, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a part of it, and therefore it is no
more one but many, and ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as there are Things received, and
yet of a greater multiplicity; therefore
there is a certain Society or Fellowſhip
among Creatures in giving and receiving,
whereby they mutually ſubſiſt one by
another, ſo that one cannot live without
another; for what Creature in the whole
World can be found that hath no need of
its Fellow-Creature? Certainly none;
therefore by conſequence every Creature
which hath Life, Senſe, or Motion, ought
to be a Number, or a Multiplicity; yea,
a Number without Number, or Infinite
in reſpect of any created Intellect. But
if it be ſaid, ought not the Central or
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52717:66"/>
governing Spirit to be but one only A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom;
for otherwiſe how can it be called
a Centre, and the chief Spirit, having
Dominion over the reſt? I Anſwer in the
Negative: For this Centre it ſelf, or chief,
and governing Spirit, is manifold, for
the Reaſons before alledged; but it is
called a Centre, becauſe all the other
Spirits concur to it, as Lines from all
parts of the Circumference do meet at the
Centre, and do again depart out or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
therefrom; and indeed the unity of
the Spirits that compoſe or make up this
Centre, or governing Spirit, is more firm
and tenacious, than that of all the other
Spirits; which are, as it were, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
or Miniſtring Spirits of their Prince
or Captain; yea, in Man this Unity is ſo
great, that nothing can diſſolve it, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Unity of the greateſt Plenty
of Miniſtring Spirits, which belong not
to the compoſition of this Centre) may
be diſſolved: Hence it comes to paſs
that the Soul of every Man ſhall remain
an entire everlaſting Soul, or be of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
duration, that it may receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Fruit of its labour, and that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Law of Juſtice (which is written
on every Thing) doth require, which is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52717:67"/>
as a moſt ſtrong and indiſſolvable Band
to preſerve this Unity: For what is more
congruous with this Infinite Juſtice and
Wiſdom than this, That they who have
joined together, and conſented to work
either Good or Evil, ſhall together re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their due Reward and Puniſhment,
which cannot be if they ſhould be diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or ſeparated one from another; and the
ſame reaſon doth prove, that the Central
Spirits of all other Creatures remain indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable;
and that although new Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
Spirits are continually form'd in the
Production of Things; yet no Central
Spirit is diſſolved, but farther promoted,
or at leaſt diminiſhed, according to the
preſent dignity or indignity, capacity
or incapacity thereof.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. TO prove that Spirit and Body
differ not eſſentially, but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually,
I ſhall deduce my Fourth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the intiment Band or Union,
which intercedes between Bodies and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
by means whereof the Spirits have
Dominion over the Bodies with which
they are united, that they move them
from one place to another, and uſe them
as Inſtruments in their various Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For if Spirit and Body are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
one to another, ſo that a Spirit is
only Life, or a living and ſenſible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but a Body a certain Maſs merely
dead; a Spirit penetrable and indiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible,
but a Body impenetrable and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible,
which are all contrary Attributes:
What (I pray you) is that which doth ſo
join or unite them together? Or, what
are thoſe Links or Chains, whereby they
have ſo firm a connexion, and that for ſo
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52717:68"/>
long a ſpace of Time? Moreover alſo,
when the Spirit or Soul is ſeparated from
the Body, ſo that it hath no longer Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
or Power over it to move it as it
had before, What is the cauſe of this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
If it be ſaid, that the vital agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Soul hath to the Body, is the
cauſe of the ſaid Union, and that the
Body being corrupted that vital Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ceaſeth. I Anſwer, We muſt firſt
enquire, in what this vital Agreement
doth conſiſt; for if they cannot tell us
wherein it doth conſiſt, they only triſle
with empty Words, which give a ſound
but want a ſignification: For certainly
in that ſence which they take Body and
Spirit in, there is no Agreement at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; for a Body is always a dead
Thing, void of Life and ſenſe, no leſs
when the Spirit is in it, than when it is
gone out of it: Hence there is no Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at all between them; and if there
is any Agreement, that certainly will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the ſame, both when the Body is
found, and when it is corrupted. If they
deny this, becauſe a Spirit requires an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
Body, by means whereof it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
its vital Acts of the external Senſes;
moves and tranſports the Body from place
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52717:69"/>
to place; which Organical Action ceaſes
when the Body is corrupted. Certainly
by this the difficulty is never the better
ſolved. For why doth the Spirit require
ſuch an organized Body? <hi>ex. gr.</hi> Why
doth it require a Corporeal Eye ſo
wonderfully formed and organized, that
I can ſee by it? Why doth it need a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Light, to ſee Corporeal Objects?
Or, why is it requiſite, that the Image
of the Object ſhould be ſent to it, through
the Eye, that it may ſee it? If the ſame
were entirely nothing but a Spirit, and
no way Corporeal, Why doth it need ſo
many ſeveral Corporeal Organs, ſo far
different from the Nature of it? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
how can a Spirit move its Body,
or any of its Members, if a Spirit (as they
affirm) is of ſuch a Nature, that no part
of its Body can in the leaſt reſiſt it, even
as one Body is wont to reſiſt another,
when 'tis moved by it, by reaſon of its
Impenetrability? For if a Spirit could ſo
eaſily penetrate all Bodies, Wherefore
doth it not leave the Body behind it, when
it is moved from place to place, ſeeing it
can ſo eaſily paſs out without the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance?
For certainly this is the cauſe of
all Motions which we ſee in the World,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52717:69"/>
where one Thing moves another, <hi>viz.</hi>
becauſe both are impenetrable in the ſence
aforeſaid: For were it not for this Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrability
one Creature could not move
another, becauſe this would not oppoſe
that, nor at all reſiſt it; an Example
whereof we have in the Sails of a Ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by which the Wind drives the Ship, and
that ſo much the more vehemently, by
how much the fewer holes, vents, and
paſſages, the ſame finds in the Sails a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which it drives: When on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if inſtead of Sails Nets were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded,
through which the Wind would
have a freer paſſage; certainly by theſe
the Ship would be but little moved, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it blew with great violence:
Hence we ſee how this Impenetrability
cauſes reſiſtance, and this makes Motion.
But if there were no Impenetrability, as
in the caſe of Body and Spirit, then there
could be no reſiſtance, and by conſequence
the Spirit could make no motion in the
Body.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. AND if it be objected, That
God is altogether incorporeal and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally
preſent in all Bodies, and yet doth
move Bodies whetherſoever he pleaſeth,
and is the Firſt Mover of all Things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:52717:70"/>
and yet nothing is impenetrable to him:
I Anſwer, This Motion by which God
moves a Body, doth wonderfully differ
from that manner by which the Soul
moves the Body; for the Will of God
which gave Being to Bodies, gave them
Motion alſo, ſo that Motion it ſelf is of
God, by whoſe Will all Motion happens:
For as a Creature cannot give Being to it
ſelf, ſo neither can it move it ſelf; for in
him we Live, Move, and have our Being;
ſo that Motion and Eſſence come from
the ſame cauſe, <hi>ſc.</hi> God the Creator, who
remains immoveable in himſelf; neither is
he carried from place to place, becauſe he
is equally preſent every where, and gives
Being to Creatures: But the caſe is far
different, when the Soul moves the
Body; for the Soul is not the Author
of Motion, but only determines it to
this or that particular Thing: And the
Soul it ſelf is moved, together with the
Body, from place to place; and if the
Body be impriſoned, or held in Chains,
it cannot free or deliver it ſelf out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or out of Chains: Wherefore it would
be a very unfit compariſon, if one ſhould
go about to illuſtrate that Motion the
Soul makes in the Body, by an Example
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52717:70"/>
of God moving his Creatures; yea, ſo
great is the difference, as if a Man ſhould
go to demonſtrate how a Carpenter
builds a Ship, or an Houſe, by an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God creating the firſt Matter or
Subſtance, wherein certainly there is as
great a diſparity or diſproportion; for
God gave Being to Creatures, but a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
doth not give Being to the Wood
whereof he builds a Ship.</p>
               <p>But no Man can think, becauſe I have
ſaid, All Motion of Creatures is of God,
that therefore he is, or can be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
or Cauſe of Sin: For although the
moving Power be of God, yet Sin is not
in the leaſt of God, but of the Creature,
who hath abuſed this Power, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to ſome other end than it ought:
So that Sin is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or an inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of Motion, or the power of
moving from its due place, ſtate, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
unto ſome other, as, <hi>v. g.</hi> a Ship is
moved by the Wind, but governed by the
Mariner, that it goes to this or that place;
where the Mariner is not the Author or
Cauſe of the Wind; but the Wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he makes either a good or a bad uſe
of the ſame, whereby he either brings
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52717:71"/>
the Ship to the place intended, and ſo
is commended; or elſe ſo manages her
that ſhe ſuffers Shipwrack, for which
he is blamed, and worthy of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Why is the Spirit or Soul
ſo paſſible in corporal Pains? For if when
it is united with the Body, it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Corporeity, or a bodily Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Why is it grieved or wounded when
the Body is wounded, which is quite of
a different Nature? For ſeeing the Soul
can ſo eaſily penetrate the Body, How can
any Corporeal Thing hurt it? If it be
ſaid, the Body only feels the pain, but
not the Soul; this is contrary to their
own Principles, becauſe they affirm,
that the Body hath neither Life nor
Senſe: But if it be granted, that the Soul
is of one Nature and Subſtance with the
Body, although it is many degrees more
excellent in regard of Life and Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as alſo in ſwiftneſs of Motion, and
Penetrability, and divers other Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
then all the aforeſaid difficulties
will vaniſh, and it will be eaſily conceived,
how the Body and Soul are united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and how the Soul moves the Body,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52717:71"/>
and ſuffers by it or with it. What the
Opinion of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is appears
from a place in <hi>Kabbal. denud.</hi> Tom. 1.
Part. 3. Diſſert. 8. Cap. 13. p. 171.
<hi>ſeq.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. FOR we may eaſily underſtand
how one Body is united with another, by
that true agreement that one hath with
another in its own Nature; and ſo the moſt
ſubtile and Spiritual Body may be united
with a Body that is very groſs and thick,
<hi>ſc.</hi> by means of certain Bodies, partaking
of ſubtilty and groſsneſs, according to
divers degrees, conſiſting between two
Extreams, and theſe middle Bodies are
indeed the Links and Chains, by which
the Soul, which is ſo ſubtile and Spiritual,
is conjoined with a Body ſo groſs; which
middle Spirits (if they ceaſe, or are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
the Union is broken or diſſolved;
ſo from the ſame Foundation we may
eaſily underſtand, how the Soul moves
the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> as one ſubtile Body can
move another groſs and thick Body:
And ſeeing Body it ſelf is a ſenſible Life,
or an intellectual Subſtance, it is no leſs
clearly conſpicuous, how one Body can
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52717:72"/>
wound, or grieve, or gratifie, or pleaſe
another; becauſe Things of one, or alike
Nature, can eaſily affect each other:
And to this Argument may be reduced
the like difficulties, <hi>viz.</hi> how Spirits
move Spirits; and how ſome Spirits
ſtrive and contend with other Spirits;
alſo concerning the Unity, Concord,
and Friendſhip, which good Spirits reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
among themſelves; for if all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
could be intrinſecally preſent one
with another, How could they diſpute
or contend about place? And how can
one expel or drive out another? and yet
that there is ſuch an expulſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
of Spirits, and eſpecially of the Good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Evil, ſome few who have been
acquainted with their own Hearts have
experimentally known. If it be ſaid, the
Spirit of God and Chriſt are intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
preſent in all Things, contends
with, and makes War againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and his Spirit, in the Heart of Man.
I Anſwer, That this is alſo a very unfit
ſimilitude, <hi>(viz.)</hi> when God and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are compared in their Operations:
For his Ways are infinitely Superiour to
ours; yet nevertheleſs in this caſe alſo
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52717:72"/>
here remains a ſtrong Objection. For
the Spirits of God and Chriſt, when they
ſtrive againſt the Devil, and the Evil
Spirits in the Heart of Man, do unite
themſelves with certain good Spirits,
whom they have ſanctified and prepared
for this Union; and by theſe, as a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle,
or Triumphant Chariot, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
againſt and encounter thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
and Wicked Spirits: And in as
much as theſe Evil Spirits contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe Good Spirits in the Heart of
Man, they contend againſt God and
Chriſt; and theſe Good Spirits are the
Spirits of this faithful and pious Man,
who is become Good, when as before
he was Evil: For God and Chriſt do
help every pious Man to prevail over
the Evil Spirits in this Conflict, but
ſuffers the Wicked and Unfaithful to be
captivated and overcome; for God helps
none but thoſe that fear, love, and obey
him, and truſt in his Power, Goodneſs,
and Truth; for with ſuch he is united,
and the good Spirits of ſuch Men are as
ſo many Swords and Darts, whereby
thoſe dark and unclean Spirits are
wounded and repulſed. But if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52717:73"/>
how the Soul of Man can be
united with God, though it were in a
State of the higheſt Purity; becauſe he
is a mere Spirit; but the Soul even in its
greateſt Purity always partakes of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity?
I Anſwer, It is done by Jeſus
Chriſt, who is the true and proper <hi>Medium</hi>
between both; for Chriſt and the Soul
may be united without a <hi>Medium,</hi> by
reaſon of that great Affinity and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
between them, which thoſe
Doctors cannot demonſtrate between
Spirit and Body, who ſay they are
of a Nature ſo contrary one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. I ſhall draw a Fifth Argument
from what we obſerve in all viſible Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as in Earth, Water, Stones,
Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What abundance of Spirits
is in all theſe things? For Earth and
Water continually produce Animals, as
they hath done from the beginning; ſo
that a Pool fill'd with Water may produce
Fiſhes, though none were ever put there
to increaſe or breed; and ſeeing that all
other Things do more originally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from Earth and Water, it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52717:73"/>
follows, that the Spirits of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
were in the Water; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſaid in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God moved upon the Face of
the Waters, <hi>viz.</hi> that from hence he
might produce whatſoever was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
created.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. BUT if it be ſaid, this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth not prove that all Spirits
are Bodies, but that all Bodies have in
them the Spirits of all Animals, ſo that
every Body hath a Spirit in it, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a Spirit and Body; and although
they are thus united, yet they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
different in Nature one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſo cannot be changed one
into another. To this I Anſwer, if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body, even the leaſt, hath in it the
Spirits of all Animals, and other Things;
even as matter is ſaid to have in it all
Forms: Now I demand, Whether a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
hath actually all thoſe Spirits in it,
or potentially only? If actually, How
is it poſſible that ſo many Spirits eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
diſtinct from Body, can actually
exiſt in their diſtinct Eſſences in ſo ſmall
a Body, (even in the leaſt that can be
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52717:74"/>
conceived,) unleſs it be by intrinſeck
Preſence, which is not communicable to
any Creature, as is already proved: For
if all kinds of Spirits are in any, even
the leaſt Body, How comes it to paſs,
that ſuch an Animal is produced of this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and not another? Yea, how comes it
to paſs that all kind of Animals are not
immediately produced out of one and
the ſame Body? which experience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
for we ſee that Nature keeps her
order in all her Operations; whence
one Animal is formed of another, and
one <hi>Species</hi> proceeds from another; as
well when it aſcends to a farther Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
as when it deſcends to a viler
State and Condition: But if they ſay, all
Spirits are contained in any Body, not
actually in their diſtinct Eſſences, but only
potentially as they term it; then it muſt
be granted, that the Body and all thoſe
Spirits are one and the ſame thing; that
is, that a Body may be turned into them;
as when we ſay Wood is potentially Fire,
that is, can be turned into Fire; Water
is potentially Air, that is, may be changed
into Air.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:52717:74"/>
Moreover, if Spirits and Bodies are ſo
inſeparably united, that no Body can be
without a Spirit, yea, not without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Spirits; this is certainly a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that they are of one Original
Nature and Subſtance, otherwiſe we
could not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conceive, why in ſo various
and wonderful diſſolutions, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Things, they ſhould not at length
be ſeparted one from another, as we
ſee the ſubtiler Things may be ſeparated
from the groſſer? But whence is it, that
when a Body is at length corrupted, out
of this Corruption another <hi>Species</hi> of
Things is generated? So out of Earth
and Water corrupted, proceed Animals;
yea, Stones if they putrefie or rot, paſs
into Animals: So Dung, or other putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Matter, generates Animals, all which
have Spirits: But how doth Corruption
or Diſſolution of Body tend to a new
Generation, and that indeed of Animals?
If it be ſaid the Spirits of thoſe Animals
are as it were looſed from their Bonds,
and ſet at Liberty by this diſſolution, and
that then they can form or faſhion to
themſelves a new Body, out of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Matter, by virtue of their Plaſtick
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52717:75"/>
Faculty: Unto this I reply, How did
the Primitive Body ſo hold it Captive?
Was it becauſe it was ſo hard and thick?
If ſo, it will be manifeſt that thoſe Spirits
are nothing elſe but ſubtile Bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hardneſs and denſity of Body could
impriſon them, that they could not paſs
out; for if a Spirit could as eaſily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
the hardeſt Body, as the ſofteſt
and moſt fluid, it could as eaſily paſs
out of the one as the other, nor would
there be need of Death and Corruption
to a new Life or Generation; therefore
this kind of Captivity of Spirits in ſome
kind of hard Bodies, and their deliverance
therefrom, when the Bodies become ſoft,
affords us a manifeſt Argument, that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Body are originally of one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Subſtance, and that a Body is
nothing but a fixed and condenſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and a Spirit nothing but a ſubtile
and volatile Body.</p>
               <p>And here is to be noted, that in all
hard Bodies, as in Stones, whether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or precious; and ſo alſo in Metals,
Herbs, Trees, and Animals; yea, in all
Humane Bodies, there don't only exiſt
many Spirits (which are as it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52717:75"/>
in thoſe groſs Bodies, and united
with them, and therefore cannot flow
forth, or fly out into other Bodies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they have paſſed Death or Diſſolution;)
but alſo many other very ſubtile Spirits,
which continually flow from them, and
which by reaſon of their ſubtilty, the
hardneſs of the Body (in which they
lay hid) cannot detain; and theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are the more ſubtile Productions, or
the Sutures of the groſſer Spirits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Body; for although theſe
are detained therein, yet they are not
idle in their Priſon, but their Bodies
are as it were Shops for them to work
out thoſe ſubtiler Spirits, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
flow out in colours, ſounds, odours,
taſtes, and divers other Powers and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
whence the groſs Body, and the
Spirits therein contained, are as it were
the Mother of thoſe ſubtiler Spirits, who
take the place of Children; for Nature
ſtill works to a farther perfection of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
and ſpirituality; even as this is the
moſt natural Property of all Motion and
Operation: For all Motion wears and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides,
and ſo renders a Thing ſubtile and
ſpiritual. Even thus in Man's Body, the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52717:76"/>
Meat and Drink is firſt changed into
Chyle, then into Blood, afterwards into
Spirits, which are nothing elſe but Blood
brought to perfection; and theſe Spirits,
whether good or bad, ſtill advance to
a greater ſubtilty or ſpirituality, and by
thoſe Spirits which come from the Blood,
we ſee, hear, ſmell, taſte, feel, and think,
yea meditate, love, hate, and do all things
whatſoever we do; and from hence alſo
cometh the Seed, by which Humane
Kind is propagated; and hence eſpecially
proceeds the Voice and Speech of Man,
which is full of Spirits (form'd in the
Heart) either Good or Evil, as Chriſt
hath taught; <hi>That out of the Plenty of
the Heart the Mouth ſpeaketh, and that
a Good Man out of the Good Treaſure of
his Heart bringeth forth Good Things,</hi> &amp;c.
Alſo <hi>that which goeth into a Man doth
not defile him, but that which proceeds
out of him;</hi> for in like manner as they
proceed from him, ſo ſhall they again
return into him.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. AND theſe are the proper
Angels, or Miniſtring Spirits of a Man,
(although there are other Angels alſo,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52717:76"/>
as well Good as Evil, which come unto
Men:) Of which Angels Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
where he ſpeaketh of thoſe little
Ones that believe on him: <hi>Their Angels</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>always behold the Face of my
Heavenly Father.</hi> Which are the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of thoſe Believers, who become, as
it were, like little Infants.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. MY ſixth and laſt Argument
I ſhall deduce from certain Texts of
Scripture, as well of the Old as New
Teſtament, which do prove in plain and
expreſs Words, that all Things have
Life, and do really live in ſome degree
or meaſure. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27. It is ſaid, <hi>He
giveth Life to all Things.</hi> Again,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13. of God it is ſaid, <hi>That
he quickens all Things.</hi> And <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.
38. he is not called, <hi>The God of the
Dead, but of the Living,</hi> (which
though principally meant of Men, yet
it is generally to be underſtood of all
other Creatures,) <hi>viz.</hi> he is the God
of all thoſe Things which have their
Regeneration and Reſurrection in their
kind, no leſs then Man hath in his
Kind: For Death is not the Annihilation
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52717:77"/>
of theſe Things; but a change from
one kind and degree of Life to another;
wherefore alſo the Apoſtle proves, and
illuſtrates the Reſurrection of the Dead
by a Grain of Wheat, which being faln
into the ground, dies, and riſeth again
exceeding fruitful.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>§. 1. The Philoſophers (ſo called) of all
Sects, have generally laid an ill Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to their Philoſophy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole Structure muſt needs
fall. §. 2. The Philoſophy here treated
on is not <hi>Carteſian.</hi> §. 3. Nor the
Philoſophy of <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa,</hi>
(falſly ſo feigned,) but diametrically
oppoſite to them. §. 4. That they who
have attempted to refute <hi>Hobbs</hi> and
<hi>Spinoſa,</hi> have given them too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
§. 5. This Philoſophy is the
ſtrongeſt to refute <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa,</hi>
but after another method. §. 6. We
understand here quite another thing
by Body and Matter, than <hi>Hobbs</hi>
underſtood; and which <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and
<hi>Spinoſa,</hi> never ſaw, otherwiſe
than in a Dream. §. 7. Life is as
really and properly an Attribute of
Body, as Figure. §. 8. Figure and
Life are diſtinct, but not contrary
Attributes of one and the ſame thing.

or Perfection of Life, distinguiſhes
Things.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. FROM what hath been lately
ſaid, and from divers Reaſons
alledged, That Spirit and Body are ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
in their firſt Subſtance but one
and that ſame thing, it evidently appears
that the Philoſophers (ſo called) which
have taught otherwiſe, whether An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
or Modern, have generally erred
and laid an ill Foundation in the very
beginning, whence the whole Houſe and
Superſtructure is ſo feeble, and indeed
ſo unprofitable, that the whole Edifice
and Building muſt in time decay, from
which abſurd Foundation have aroſe very
many groſs and dangerous Errours, not
only in Philoſophy, but alſo in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
(ſo called) to the great damage
of Mankind, hindrance of true Piety,
and contempt of God's moſt Glorious
Name, as will eaſily appear, as well from
what hath been already ſaid, as from
what ſhall be ſaid in this Chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:52717:78"/>
§. 2. AND none can Object, That
all this Philoſophy is no other than that
of <hi>des Cartes,</hi> or <hi>Hobbs</hi> under a new
Mask. For, Firſt, as touching the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſian</hi>
Philoſophy, this ſaith that every
Body is a mere dead Maſs, not only void
of all kind of Life and Senſe, but utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uncapable thereof to all Eternity; this
grand Errour alſo is to be imputed to all
thoſe who affirm Body and Spirit to be
contrary Things, and inconvertible one
into another, ſo as to deny a Body all
Life and Senſe; which is quite contrary
to the grounds of this our Philoſophy.
Wherefore it is ſo far from being a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſian</hi>
Principle, under a new Mask, that
it may be truly ſaid it is <hi>Anti-Carteſian,</hi>
in regard of their Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
although it cannot be denied that
<hi>Cartes</hi> taught many excellent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Things concerning the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
part of Natural Operations, and
how all Natural Motions proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Rules and Laws Mechanical, even
as indeed Nature her ſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
hath an excellent Mechanical Skill
and Wiſdom in it ſelf, (given it from God,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52717:79"/>
who is the Fountain of all Wiſdom,) by
which it operates: But yet in Nature,
and her Operations, they are far more
than merely Mechanical; and the ſame
is not a mere Organical Body, like a
Clock, wherein there is not a vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Motion; but a living Body,
having Life and Senſe, which Body is
far more ſublime than a mere Mechaniſm,
or Mechanical Motion.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. BUT, Secondly, as to what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Opinion, this is yet more
contrary to this our Philoſophy, than
that of <hi>Cartes;</hi> for <hi>Cartes</hi> acknowledged
God to be plainly Immaterial, and an
Incorporeal Spirit. <hi>Hobbs</hi> affirms God
himſelf to be Material and Corporeal;
yea, nothing elſe but Matter and Body,
and ſo confounds God and the Creatures
in their Eſſences, and denies that there
is any Eſſential Diſtinction between them.
Theſe and many more the worſt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
are the Dictates of <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s
Philoſophy; to which may be added that
of <hi>Spinoſa;</hi> for this <hi>Spinoſa</hi> alſo confounds
God and the Creatures together, and
makes but one Being of both; all which
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52717:79"/>
are diametrically oppoſite to the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
here delivered by us.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. BUT the falſe and feeble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of ſome who have undertaken to
refute the Philoſophy of <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſa,</hi>
ſo called, have given them a greater
advantage againſt themſelves; ſo that
they have not only in effect, not refuted
them, but more expoſed themſelves to
Contempt and Laughter.</p>
               <p>But if it be Objected, That this our
Philoſophy ſeems, at leaſt, very like that
of <hi>Hobbs,</hi> becauſe he taught that all
Creatures were originally one Subſtance,
from the loweſt and moſt ignoble, to
the higheſt and nobleſt; from the ſmalleſt
Worm, Inſect, or Fly, unto the moſt
Glorious Angel; yea, from the leaſt Duſt
or Sand, unto the moſt excellent of all
Creatures; and then this, that every
Creature is Material and Corporeal; yea,
Matter and Body it ſelf; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
the moſt Noble Actions thereof,
are either Material and Corporeal, or
after a certain Corporeal manner. Now
I Anſwer to the Firſt, I grant that all
Creatures are originally one Subſtance,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52717:80"/>
from the loweſt to the higheſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
convertible or changeable, from
one of their Natures into another; and
although <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſaith the ſame, yet that
is no prejudice to the Truth of it, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are other parts of that Philoſophy
where <hi>Hobbs</hi> affirms ſomething that is
true, therefore an <hi>Hobbiſm,</hi> or an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Hobbs</hi> alone.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. MOREOVER, this Principle
is ſo far from defending them in their
Errours, that nothing is ſo ſtrong to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
them, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> The <hi>Hobbiſts</hi> argue,
all Things are one, becauſe we ſee that
all viſible Things may be changed one
into another; yea, that all viſible Things
may be changed into inviſible, as when
Water is made Air, and Wood being
burnt (for the greateſt part) is changed
into a certain inviſible Subſtance, which
is ſo ſubtile, that it eſcapes all obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Senſes; add to which, that
all inviſible Things may become viſible,
as when Water proceeds from Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and hence he concludes, nothing is ſo
low that it cannot attain to ſublimity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:52717:80"/>
But now that we may Anſwer to this
Argument, his Adverſaries generally deny
the Antecedent, and on the contrary
affirm that no <hi>Spicies</hi> of Things is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible
into another: And when Wood
is burnt, many ſay that the Wood is
compoſed of two Subſtances; to wit,
Matter and Form, and that the Matter
remains the ſame, but the Form of the
Wood is deſtroyed or annihilated, and
a new Form of Fire is produced in this
Matter; ſo that according to them, here
is a continual Annihilation of real Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
and Productions of new Ones in
this World: But this is ſo frivolous, that
many others deny that, in the caſe of
Wood, changed into Fire, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
into Smoak and Aſhes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they
ſtill perſiſt in the ſame Errour in other
Tranſmutations, as when Wood is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into an Animal, as we often ſee that
of rotten Wood; yea, Dung alſo, living
Creatures are generated: But if they
deny here, that the Wood is changed into
an Animal, and ſay that Wood is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Matter; but Matter hath not
Life, nor a capacity to Life or Senſe;
and therefore this Animal which hath
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52717:81"/>
Life and Senſe, ought to have the ſame
from elſewhere, and muſt have a Spirit
or Soul in it, that is not a part of its Body,
neither doth proceed from it, but is ſent
<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>er.</p>
               <p>But if it be demanded of them, from
whence this Spirit is ſent, and who ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it? Alſo why a Spirit of this <hi>Species</hi>
is ſent, and not of another; here they are
at a ſtand, and yield themſelves to their
Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Therefore this our Philoſophy before
laid down, more ſtrongly conduces to
the refutation of the <hi>Hobbeſian</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſian</hi>
Philoſophy, <hi>viz.</hi> that all Kinds
of Creatures may be changed one into
another, that the loweſt may become
the higheſt, and the higheſt (as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
originally in its own proper Nature)
may become the loweſt, <hi>ſc.</hi> according to
that Courſe and Succeſſion which Divine
Wiſdom hath ordained, that one Change
may ſucceed another in a certain order;
ſo that <hi>A</hi> muſt be firſt turned into <hi>B,</hi>
before it can be turned into <hi>C,</hi> which
muſt be turned into <hi>C,</hi> before it can be
changed into <hi>D, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:52717:81"/>
But we deny the Conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi>
that God and Creatures are one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>For in all Tranſmutations of Creatures
from one <hi>Species</hi> into another, as from
a Stone into Earth, and from Earth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Graſs, and from Graſs to a Sheep, and
from a Sheep into Humane Fleſh, and
from Humane Fleſh into the moſt ſervile
Spirits of Man, and from theſe into his
nobleſt Spirits; but there can never be
a Progreſſion or Aſcenſion made unto
God, who is the chiefeſt of all Beings,
and whoſe Nature ſtill infinitely excels a
Creature placed in his higheſt Perfection;
for the Nature of God is every way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,
ſo that it doth not admit
of the leaſt Shadow of a Change: But
the Nature of a Creature is to be change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. SECONDLY, If it be ſaid, by
way of Objection, that according to this
Philoſophy, every Creature is Material
and Corporeal; yea, Body and Matter it
ſelf, as <hi>Hobbs</hi> teacheth. Now I Anſwer,
That by Material and Corporeal, as alſo
by Matter and Body, here the thing is far
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52717:82"/>
otherwiſe underſtood, than <hi>Hobbs</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
it, and which was never diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to <hi>Hobbs</hi> or <hi>Cartes,</hi> otherwiſe than
in a Dream: For what do they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by Matter and Body? Or, What
Attributes do they aſcribe to them?
None, certainly, but theſe following as
are Extenſion and Impenetrability, which
nevertheleſs are but one Attribute; to
which alſo may be referred Figurability
and Mobility. But, ſuppoſe, theſe are
diſtinct Attributes, certainly this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
nothing, nor will ever help us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what that excellent Subſtance
is, which they call Body and Matter;
for they have never proceeded beyond
the Husk or Shell, nor ever reached the
Kernel, they only touch the Superficies,
never diſcerning the Centre, they were
plainly ignorant of the nobleſt and moſt
excellent Attributes of that Subſtance
which they call Body and Matter, and
underſtood nothing of them, But if it
be demanded, what are thoſe more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Attributes? I Anſwer, theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
Spirit, or Life, and Light, under
which I comprehend, a capacity of all kind
of Feeling, Senſe, and Knowledge, Love,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52717:82"/>
Joy, and Fruition, and all kind of Power
and Virtue, which the nobleſt Creatures
have or can have; ſo that even the vileſt
and moſt contemptible Creature; yea, Duſt
and Sand, may be capable of all thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<hi>ſc.</hi> through various and ſucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous
Tranſmutations from the one
into the other; which according to the
Natural Order of Things, require long
Periods of Time for their Conſummation,
although the abſolute Power of God (if
it had pleaſed him) could have accelerated
or haſtened all Things, and effected it in
one moment: But this Wiſdom of God
ſaw it to be more expedient, that all
Things ſhould proceed in their Natural
Order and Courſe; ſo that after this
manner, that Fertility or Fruitfulneſs,
which he hath endued every Being
with, may appear, and the Creatures
have Time by Working ſtill to promote
themſelves to a greater Perfection, as
the Inſtruments of Divine Wiſdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Power, which operates in, and
with them; for therein the Creature
hath the greater Joy, when it poſſeſſeth
what it hath, as the Fruit of its own
labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:52717:83"/>
But this capacity of the afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Perfections is quite a diſtinct At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
from Life, and Underſtanding,
or Knowledge, quite diſtinct from the
former, <hi>viz.</hi> Extenſion and Figure; and
ſo alſo a Vital Action is plainly diſtinct
from Local, or Mechanical Motion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is not nor cannot be ſeparated
from it, but ſtill uſeth the ſame at leaſt,
as its Inſtrument, in all its concourſe
with the Creatures.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. I SAY, Life and Figure are diſtinct
Attributes of one Subſtance, and as one
and the ſame Body may be tranſmuted
into all Kinds of Figures; and as the
perfecter Figure comprehends that which
is more imperfect; ſo one and the ſame
Body may be tranſmuted from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Life to another more perfect,
which always comprehends in it the
inferior. We have an Example of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
in a Triangular Priſme, which is
the firſt Figure of all right lined ſolid
Bodies, whereinto a Body is convertible;
and from this into a Cube, which is a
perfecter Figure, and comprehends in
it a Priſme; from a Cube it may be
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52717:83"/>
turned into a more perfect Figure, which
comes nearer to a Globe, and from this
into another, which is yet nearer; and
ſo it aſcends from one Figure, more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
to another more perfect, <hi>ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum;</hi>
for here are no bounds; nor
can it be ſaid, this Body cannot be changed
into a perfecter Figure: But the meaning
is, that that Body conſiſts of plain right
lines; and this is always changeable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a perfecter Figure, and yet can never
reach to the perfection of a Globe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it always approaches nearer unto
it; the caſe is the ſame in divers degrees
of Life, which have indeed a beginning,
but no end; ſo that the Creature is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
capable of a farther and perfecter
degree of Life, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and yet can
never attain to be equal with God; for
he is ſtill infinitely more perfect than a
Creature, in its higheſt Elevation or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
even as a Globe is the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of all other Figures, unto which none
can approach.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. AND thus Life and Figure are
diſtinct, but not contrary Attributes of
one and the ſame Subſtance, and Figure
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52717:84"/>
ſerves the Operations of Life, as we ſee
in the Body of Man or Beaſt, how the
Figure of the Eye ſerves the Sight; the
Figure of the Ear, the Hearing; the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the Mouth, Teeth, Lips, and
Tongue, ſerve the Speech; the Figure
of the Hands and Fingers ſerve to Work;
the Figure of the Feet to Walk; and ſo
the Figures of all the other Members have
their uſe, and very much conduce to the
Vital Operations, which the Spirit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
in theſe Members; Yea the Figure
of the whole Body is more commodious
for the proper Operations of Human Life,
than any other Figure whatſoever is, or
could be made; So that Life and Figure
conſiſt very well together in one Body, or
Subſtance, where Figure is an Inſtrument
of Life, without which no Vital Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can be performed.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. LIKEWISE, Local and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Motion <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the carrying of
Body from place to place, is a Manner or
Operation diſtinct from Action or Vital
Operation, altho' they are inſeparable, ſo
that a Vital Action can in no wiſe be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Local Motion, becauſe this is the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52717:84"/>
Inſtrument thereof. So the Eye cannot
ſee, unleſs Light enter it, which is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſtirs up a Vital Action in the Eye,
which is Seeing; and ſo in all other Vital
Operations in the whole Body. But an
Action of Life is a far Nobler and Diviner
manner of Operation than Local Motion;
and yet both agree to one Subſtance, and
conſiſt well together; for as the Eye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the Light into it ſelf, from the
Object which it ſeeth from without; ſo
alſo it ſends the ſame Light to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and in this Spirit and Life is a Vital
Action, uniting the Object and Sight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and all others who
ſide with him, grievouſly erre, whilſt they
teach that Senſe and Knowledge is no
other than a re-action of Corporeal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
one upon another, where, by re-action,
he means no other than Local and
Mechanical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Motion. But indeed Senſe
and Knowledge is a Thing far more
Noble and Divine, than any Local or
Mechanical, Motion of any Particles what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
for it is the Motion or Action
of Life, which uſes the other as its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
whoſe Service conſiſts herein;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52717:85"/>
that is, to ſtir up a Vital Action in the
Subject or Percipient; and can like Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Motion be tranſmitted through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Bodies, although very far diſtant
aſunder, which therefore are united, and
that without any new Tranſition of Body
or Matter, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> a Beam of Wood of an
exceeding great length, is moved by one
Extream from the North to the South,
the other Extream will neceſſarily be
moved alſo; and the Action is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
through the whole Beam, without
any Particles of Matter ſent hither to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Motion, from one Extream to the
other; becauſe the Beam it ſelf is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to tranſmit the ſaid Motion: After
the ſame manner alſo, a Vital Action can
proceed together with Local Motion
from one thing to another, and that too
at a great diſtance, where there is an apt
and fit <hi>Medium</hi> to tranſmit it, and here
we may obſerve a kind of Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality
or Subtilty in every Motion,
and ſo in every Action of Life, which no
created Body or Subſtance is capable of,
<hi>viz.</hi> by Intrinſecal Preſence, which (as
before is proved) agrees to no created
Subſtance; and yet agrees to every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52717:85"/>
or Action whatſoever: For Motion
or Action is not a certain Matter or
Subſtance, but only a manner of its
Being; and therefore is intrinſecally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in the Subject, whereof there is a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
or Manner, and can paſs from Body
to Body, at a great diſtance, if it finds a
fit <hi>Medium</hi> to tranſmit it; and by how
much the ſtronger the Motion is, ſo much
the farther it reacheth; ſo when a Stone
is caſt into ſtanding Waters, it cauſes a
Motion every way from the Centre to
the Circumference, forming Circles ſtill
greater and greater at a great diſtance,
by how much longer the time is, till at
length it vaniſhes from our ſight; and
then without doubt, it makes yet more
inviſible Circles for a longer ſpace of
Time, which our dull Senſes cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and this Motion is tranſmitted
from the Centre to the Circumference,
not conveighed thither by any Body or
Subſtance, carrying this Motion with it
from the Stone. And as the External
Light alſo, ſeeing it is an Action or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſtirred up by ſome illuminate Body,
may be tranſmitted through Glaſs, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal,
or any other tranſparent Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52717:86"/>
out any Subſtance, Body, or Matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
from that illuminate Body from
whence the ſaid Action proceeded, not
that I would deny that abundance of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Matter continually flows from all il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate
Bodies, ſo that the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of a burning Candle is ſpent in ſuch
Emanations: And this hath in it that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Action, which we call Light; but
this Motion or Action may be increaſed,
<hi>v. g.</hi> by Chryſtal, where thoſe ſubtile E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations
of Bodies may be reſtrained,
that they cannot paſs out at leaſt in ſuch
abundance, as may be ſufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the whole Light: But ſeeing
Chryſtal (which doth ſo eaſily tranſmit
the Light) is ſo hard and ſolid, How
can it receive ſo many Bodies, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them ſo eaſily through it, when other
Bodies, neither ſo hard nor ſolid, do let
or reſiſt it? for Wood is neither ſo hard
nor ſolid as Chryſtal, and yet Chryſtal is
tranſparent, but Wood not; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Wood is more porous than Chryſtal,
becauſe it is leſs ſolid, and conſequently
the Light doth not enter by the Pores of
the Chryſtal, but through the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of it; and yet ſo as not to adhere
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52717:86"/>
to it, or make any turgeſcency or increaſe
of Quantity, but by a certain intrinſeck
preſence, becauſe it is not a Body or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but a mere Action or Motion.
Now Chryſtal is a fitter <hi>Medium</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this Motion, which we call Light,
than Wood is; and hence it is, that it
pervades or paſſeth through that and not
this; and as there is a great diverſity of
the Motion and Operation of Bodies, ſo
every Motion requires its proper <hi>Medium</hi>
to tranſmit the ſame. Therefore 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that Motion may be tranſmitted
through diverſe Bodies, by another kind
of penetration, than any Body or Matter
(how ſubtile ſoever it be) is able to make;
to wit, by intrinſeck Preſence. And if
mere Local or Mechanical Motion can
do that, then certainly a Vital Action
(which is a nobler kind of Motion) can
do the ſame; and if it can penetrate thoſe
Bodies, it paſſeth through by intrinſeck
Preſence, then it may in one moment be
tranſmitted from one Body to another, or
rather require no time at all, I mean
Motion or Action it ſelf requires not the
leaſt time for its tranſmiſſion, although
'tis impoſſible but that the Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52717:87"/>
the Motion is carried from place to
place, ought to have ſome time, either
greater or leſſer, according to the quality
of Body and vehemency of Motion which
carries it.</p>
               <p>And therefore we ſee how every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Action, conſidered in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract,
hath a wonderful ſubtilty or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality
in it, beyond all created Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
whatſoever, ſo that neither Time
nor Place can limit the ſame; and yet
they are nothing elſe but Modes or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of created Subſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> their
Strength, Power, and Virtue, whereby
they are extendible into great Subſtances,
beyond what the Subſtance it ſelf can
make. And ſo we may diſtinguiſh Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
into Material and Virtual, which
two-fold Extenſion every Creature hath;
Material Extenſion is that which Matter,
Body, or Subſtance hath, as conſidered
without all Motion or Action; and this
Extenſion (to ſpeak properly) is neither
greater or leſſer, becauſe it would ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the ſame. A Virtual Extenſion is a
Motion or Action which a Creature hath,
whether immediately given from God, or
immediately received from its Fellow
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52717:87"/>
Creature. That which is immediately
given of God (from whom alſo it hath
its Being,) and which is the natural and
proper effect of its Eſſence, is in <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more
proper way of ſpeaking, a proper Motion
of the Creature, proceeding from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt
parts thereof; and therefore may
be called Internal Motion, as diſtinguiſhed
from External, which is only from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and therefore in reſpect thereof may
be called Foreign; and when the ſaid
External Motion endeavours to carry a
Body, or any Thing, to a place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
it hath properly no natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then it is preternatural and violent;
as when a Stone is thrown up into the
Air, which Motion being preternatural
and violent, is plainly Local and Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
and no way vital, becauſe it doth
not proceed from the Life of the Thing
ſo moved: But every Motion, proceeding
from the proper Life and Will of the
Creature, is vital; and this I call a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Life, which is not plainly Local
and Mechanical as the other, but hath in
it a Life, and Vital Virtue, and this is
the Virtual Extenſion of a Creature, which
is either greater or leſſer, according to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52717:88"/>
that kind or degree of Life wherewith
the Creature is endued, for when a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
arrives at a Nobler Kind and Degree
of Life, then doth it receive the greater
Power and Virtue to move it ſelf, and
tranſmit its vital Motions to the greateſt
diſtance.</p>
               <p>But how Motion or Action may be
tranſmitted from one Body to another,
is with many a matter of great debate;
becauſe it is not a Body or Subſtance; and
if it be only Motion of Body, how Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can paſs properly with its own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
into another, becauſe the very being
of <hi>Modus,</hi> or Manner, conſiſt herein, <hi>viz.</hi>
to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exiſt or be inherent in its own Body:
The Anſwer to this Objection, which
ſeemeth to me beſt, is this, That Motion
is not propagated from one Body to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Local Motion, becauſe Motion
it ſelf is not moved, but only moves the
Body in which it is; for if Motion could be
propagated by Local Motion, this Motion
would be propagated of another, and this
again of another, and ſo <hi>ad infinitum;</hi>
which is abſurd. Therefore the manner
of the ſaid propagation is (as it were) by
real Production or Creation; ſo that as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52717:88"/>
God and Chriſt can only create the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of a Thing, when as no Creature
can Create or give Being to any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
no not as an Inſtrument; ſo a
Creature, not of it ſelf, but in ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God, as his Inſtrument may give
exiſtence to Motion and vital Action, and
ſo the Motion in one Creature may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Motion in another: And this is all
a Creature can do towards the moving it
ſelf or its Fellow Creatures, as being the
Inſtrument of God, by which Motions a
new Subſtance is not created, but only
new <hi>Species</hi> of Things, ſo that Creatures
may be multiplied in their Kinds, whilſt
one acts upon, and moves another; and
this is the whole Work of the Creature, or
Creation, as the Inſtrument of God; but
if it moves againſt his Will, whoſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is, then it Sins, and is puniſhed
for it: But God (as before was ſaid) is
not the cauſe of Sin; for when a Creature
Sins, he abuſeth the Power God hath
granted him; and ſo the Creature is cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
and God intirely free from every
ſpot or blemiſh hereof. If therefore we
apply thoſe things which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſpoken, concerning the Attributes
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52717:89"/>
of a Body, <hi>viz.</hi> that it hath not only Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
and Figure, but Life alſo; and is not
only locally and mechanically but vitally
moveable, and can tranſmit its vital Action
whitherſoever it pleaſeth, provided it hath
a <hi>Medium</hi> aptly diſpoſed, and if it hath
none it can extend it ſelf by the ſubtile E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation
of its parts, which is the fitteſt
and moſt proper <hi>Medium</hi> of it, to receive
and tranſmit its vital Action. Hereby it
will be eaſie to Anſwer to all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whereby ſome endeavour to prove
that a Body is altogether uncapable of
Senſe and Knowledge; and it may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonſtrated, after what manner ſome
certain Body may gradually advance to
that Perfection, as not only to be capable
of ſuch Senſe and Knowledge as Brutes
have, but of any kind of Perfection what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
may happen in any Man or Angel;
and ſo we may be able to underſtand the
Words of Chriſt, <hi>that of Stones God is
able to raiſe up Children to</hi> Abraham, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
flying to ſome ſtrained Metaphor; and
if any one ſhould deny this Omnipotence
of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God is able of Stones to
