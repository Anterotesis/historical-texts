            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Sermon as it was the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
I ever preached, so was
not at all intended for the
Press; but some Discourses that have been
raised upon it, made me conclude, it was
in some sort necessary to publish it for my
own vindication.</p>
            <p>I have writ it out with all possible
exactness and fidelity; tho since I do not
read my notes, nor repeat them word for
word, I cannot answer that either in this
or the other <hi>Sermons</hi> that I have printed,
my pen has so governed, or followed my
tongue, that there was no variation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; I am sure it is here printed
as near the words I used, as I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them; and in this I have not depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only on my own memory, but on several
of my hearers, who hearkned to that <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44057:3"/>
with more than ordinary attention,
and do think that it is very punctually set
down here as I spake it.</p>
            <p>I am sure the last part of it, that presses
Loyalty and Obedience, is not at all enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
beyond what I not only preached in
that <hi>Sermon,</hi> but on many other occasions,
in which I appeal to all my Hearers. But
I leave the <hi>Sermon</hi> to speak for it self,
and me both; and will refer it to every mans
conscience that reads it, to judg whether or
not I can be concluded from it to be a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
disaffected to his Majesties Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>

               <bibl>PSAL. XXII. 21.</bibl>
               <q>Save me from the Lyons mouth, for
thou hast heard me from the horns of
the Vnicorns.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have no greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
in our Addresses
to God, than the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of past deliverances;
and we never Worship him
more decently, than when
we mix our acknowledgments for what is
past, with our Prayers for what is to come.
So <hi>David</hi> here implores the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
in an extreme danger, which is
poetically exprest, by the <hi>Lions mouth,</hi> the
figure of a <hi>Lion</hi> importing the strength as
well as the rage of his enemies; and its
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44057:4"/>
               <hi>mouth</hi> importing the nearness of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which perhaps relates to the hazards
he run of falling into the hands of <hi>Saul.</hi>
And with this he gives the reason of his
confidence in God, even in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity;
because in some former dangers,
which are expressed by the figure of being
<hi>on the horns of the unicorn,</hi> or <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> and
so being ready to be tossed up, or torn by
it, God had <hi>heard him.</hi> This perhaps relates
to his deliverance from the <hi>Lion,</hi> and the
<hi>Bear,</hi> or from <hi>Goliah.</hi> It is needless to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
more upon the words. Three things
occur very naturally to our thoughts from
them, with relation to this present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>The first is, the apprehension of danger
from a formidable and cruel Enemy.</p>
            <p>The second is, a hope of preservation
founded on former deliverances.</p>
            <p>And the third is, the mean that is here
laid before us for our preservation; it is
prayer to God, that he may <hi>save us from the
lions mouth, who has before heard us</hi> (that is,
in the Seripture-phrase <hi>delivered us) from
the horns of the unicorns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:44057:4"/>
For the first Particular, I will use no
Preambles, but plainly tell you, That it is
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which I mean, that is
both so strong and so cruel an Enemy;
and is as a Lion going about seeking how
to devour all that differ from it. As for
the Strength of this Enemy, it may be
measured by the Empire which that Church
has assumed, not onely over Mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but over their Consciences: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed the Fundamental Doctrine of
of that Church, of believing as the Church
believes; of delivering up Mens Reasons
and Consciences to be led blind-fold into
whatsoever Doctrines or Practices their
Guides impose upon them; and making
them think, that to doubt of any of these
is a Sin, and that therefore it must be
opened to the Priest, and cannot be taken
away, but by his leave, and Pardon given
by him. The Mystery of Popery lies not
so much in other Speculative Opinions,
as in this main Point, That we ought not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44057:5"/>
to trust neither our Reason nor our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in the examining such Articles as that
Church proposes to us, but must take
them all, and her Authority to boot,
which determines all the rest, upon her
own Word: So that the main thing in
controversie between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
and us, is, Whether we ought to inquire
into the Will of God our selves, or must
take it upon trust from our Guides?</p>
            <p>A Church that has established such a
Tyranny upon the tenderest Part of our
Natures, our Reason, which is the most
jealous of its Liberty, as well as the most
desirous of it, no wonder if she takes it ill
to see so sacred a Secret look'd into; for,
as it will not bear an Inquiry, so every
Inquiry into it, is a Step towards the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it off. And therefore, as her Power
is absolute over her own Votaries; so she
must bear an extreme Hatred to any that
will be so impudent as to pretend, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44057:5"/>
their Understandings are exempted from
her Yoke.</p>
            <p>Other things concur in that Church
to confirm this Empire. The Belief of the
Priests Power, both of Transubstantiating
the Bread and the Wine, and of granting
Absolution, makes it seem very reasonable
to trust a Body of Men, that are so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
qualified, with the Keeping and
Conduct of other Mens Consciences. And
after the most essential, as well as the most
uneasily subdued Power of a Man was
conquered, no wonder if the lesser Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
such as Wealth and Dominion, should
follow the other, as a sort of Perquisits.
He that can forgive the Sins of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and redeem the Souls of the Dead,
will drive a sure Trade for himself; for
though it cannot be sure that what he
does is ratified in Heaven; yet the Belief
of it, whether it gives Heaven to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser
or not, is sure to bring the best
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44057:6"/>
part of this Earth to the Seller. Men do
not return to tell that they were cheated
in the Bargain, and to demand an Equity.
On the contrary, in dark Ages nothing
was more common than pretended Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions
and Voices to confirm the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture;
which have vanished in an Age
that is more apt to suspect and examine
such things, as the Illusions of our Dreams
fly from us whenever we are awake.</p>
            <p>But the Night was so long and so
dark, that no wonder if so gainful a
Trade was carried on with great success:
And who would stand much upon the
Case, after they had parted with the Jewel?
So Mens Reasons being once given up,
no wonder if Wealth, and all other Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Advantages, were thrown into the
Bargain. A Church established upon such
a Bottom, and supported with so much
Wealth and Power, and defended by such
Multitudes, who as they have all their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44057:6"/>
Proportion of the Spoil, so are tied to it
by Vows, as well as engaged in it by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
and that has subdued so great a
part of the World, and claims a more
than ordinary Title to us, as having been
once a very valuable Part of her Empire,
is justly to be looked on as a great and
formidable Enemy.</p>
            <p>But it is not the Greatness of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that makes him so Formidable; it is
his Rage and Cruelty that gives the most
mortal Apprehensions. The old <hi>Romans</hi>
made the Nations that they subdued, Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by the Conquest they made of them:
But the Modern <hi>Romans</hi> are more unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting
Enemies. They first make all their
Votaries look on such as are not of their
Party, as Hereticks, that is, Men hated of
God, and devoted to Damnation. Now
it will be no hard thing to inspire Men
with Cruelty, when they are once posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with such inveterate Hatred and Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44057:7"/>
to a sort of Men who they believe
are to burn in Hell for ever; and so they
think they but co-operate with the Justice
of God, if they help this forward, and
bring it on a little the sooner; especially
when such Fires purifie the Air, which
would be otherwise corrupted with their
Heresie.</p>
            <p>A Church that has substituted this Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire
of Rage and Cruelty, to these gentle
Flames of Love and Charity; and that, in
stead of making us love one another,
makes us destroy and burn one another,
is the most opposite thing possible to a
Society founded on the Gospel; as if, in
stead of the Union that ought to be
among Christians, we ought onely to be
bundling up Numbers of them in Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,
to be burnt or blown up. All
means possible are taken to impose this
Cruelty on the World, which without
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44057:7"/>
some Practice and extraordinary Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
could not be wrought up to such a
Pitch, as to lay down the Bowels of a
Man, and take up the Rage of a Wolf or
Lion.</p>
            <p>Bishops among them are made to swear
at their Consecration, That they shall <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
Hereticks to the utmost of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
Decrees of General Councils have
been made for the Extirpating Hereticks;
and Indulgence, with the Pardon of Sins,
have been promised to such as should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
at it. And because there is somewhat
Great and Generous in the Nature of
most Princes, therefore they have decreed,
That if they are remiss in this Affair, of
Extirpating such as the Church condemns
of Heresie, which is onely a soft Word
for being the Churchmens Executioners,
they shall be first Excommunicated; and
if they persist in their merciful Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44057:8"/>
they are next to be Deposed, their
Subjects to be acquitted of their Oaths
of Allegiance, and their Dominions to be
disposed of to other more Zealous, that
is, less Merciful Catholicks.</p>
            <p>Thus all possible Ways are taken to
engage all sorts of People, both Clergy
and Laity, both Princes and Subjects,
into these Cruel Practices; and therefore
the Bloody things that have been done
among them, are not so much the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
of Particular Persons, as the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Effects of the Established Doctrines
and Rules of their Church, which seems
to have forced them upon all within it,
with so affected a Care, as if those who
had managed it had been jealous that
Good Nature and Common Humanity
would have been too hard for them, if
this Machin had not been set on by so
many strong Springs, that nothing should
withstand it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:44057:8"/>
So in short, here is an Enemy that if it prevails it
must either swallow up our Souls, or will be
sure if that project fails, to succeed in that which
it has in reserve, it will devour our Bodies.</p>
            <p>If any say, that these were effects of heat
long ago, which are now disowned by that
Church.</p>
            <p>To such this must be answered, That as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
says, the Church does not always put
in practise her power of deposing Princes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she is not always able to execute her Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
so this Doctrine of extirpation is either
really hid from some good-natured Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,
whose hearts might perhaps turn against a
Church that should authorize such barbarities; or
is cautiously and prudently enough disowned
by those who know it, till they see a fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
and a fit opportunity: and those who
do not now see it, may perhaps then feel it.</p>
            <p>But we are not to seek long for instances of
this cruelty, when we have such a crying one in
our eyes in the business of this day, which is the
second thing I proposed to speak to. Where
we have a Crime before us that far past all the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44057:9"/>
invention of former Ages: for never was there
any one single action, that would have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
such mischievous effects, as one spark of fire
would have done here, if God had not heard
and delivered us from the <hi>horns of the Vnicorns.</hi>
None could suspect the nature of man of so
black a design: and it was less to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from men of the same Countrey, if the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a Proselyte to <hi>Rome</hi> did not make a man
both forget that he was a man, and an English-man.
Nor was there any violent oppression in
the case, which often makes even a wise man
mad, for they were under so little pressure, that
the Government was a little censured for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misness:
so that a Merciful Prince and a gentle
Reign do not allay their fury. It had been long
in consultation among them, as may appear by
this one instance among many more that might
be given,<note place="margin">Delrio Dis. Mag. lib. 6. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Delrio</hi> a Jesuite in a book Printed at
<hi>Leuvain,</hi> but five years before this, puts a Case,
<hi>Whether if a Confederate discover in Confession
that he or some else have placed Gunpowder, or
such like matter under such or such a house, and
unless it be removed, the House will be blown up,
the Prince destroyed, and as many as are in or
going out of the City, will sustain great mischief, or
run an extream hazard, the Priest ought to reveal
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44057:9"/>
it?</hi> It is determined in the Negative, that he
ought not to do it; and for this he cites a Bull
of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighths, against the taking
any notice of things discovered in Confession,
which though it related only to Superiours, and
required them to take no notice in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of such things as they know in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
yet the Jesuite argues from thence, that
the Pope approved the opinion, that Confessors
ought to behave themselves in all respects, as if
they had heard nothing at all in Confession.
This being published so near <hi>England,</hi> and so
near the time when this Train was laying, shews
that it was then in their thoughts: for it is a
case that had never before fallen out, and so
was not likely to have fallen into a mans thoughts,
if the thing had not been in consultation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. In conclusion, when a sufficient
number were cemented by so many Oaths and
Sacraments in such a black design, then it was
laid with so much artifice, that it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it could have miscarried. Thus were our
Fathers upon the <hi>horns of the Vnicorns,</hi> when
by an unlookt for accident it appeared, that that
eye to which those dark places lay naked, took
pitie on us, and laid this open to the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of King, and Queen, and Prince, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44057:10"/>
and Nobility, the Commons and all others
whom that great solemnity of the meeting of a
Parliament commonly brings together; besides
the crouds round about the place, who would
very probably have had a large share of so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
an Earthquake, as so much Gunpowder
must have produced. It is true, some humanity
was left, but it was only to their own Party;
warning was given to so many, that there were
not above <hi>Three worth Saving,</hi> in their account,
in all that vast Assembly, who were not adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to absent themselves, as Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi>
writ out of Prison to a Friend.</p>
            <p>One of these Advertisements being conveyed
very odly to a Lord of that Religion, gave him
the happy opportunity of being the instrument
that brought out all this secret provision for so
many deaths that was laid up in store. The
bold Incendiary that undertook the thing, was
taken, and all broke out: but then, though a
great many of those who had not learnt the
<hi>depths of Satan,</hi> were so far overcome by the
Discovery, as to confess all, yet as one of these
was prevailed with to retract that afterwards, but
a few minutes before his death in prison, which
prevented his suffering by the hand of Justice,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44057:10"/>
so the Jesuites shewed on this occasion how they
can steel their Consciences, both in undertaking
the blackest Crimes; and in throwing off that
guilt with the most impudent denials. <hi>Garnet</hi>
their <hi>Provincial</hi> did this to a degree of assurance,
that astonished those who took his Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> one of the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in his Letters, of which I have seen the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals,
calls that Conspiracy, <hi>A Cause dearer
to him than his Life;</hi> and so powerfully had the
poyson of that Religion corrupted his thoughts,
that in all his Letters writ during his imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
even in his last Advices to his Children,
there is not the least hint of Repentance for his
engagement in so vile a design, though in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respects he appeared to be a man that was
both Vertuously and Religiously inclined, such
an influence has that Religion even on the best
natures.</p>
            <p>If after all this, these had been only the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
practices of some Assassinates, though it
would have left some Imputation on a Church,
for having such Members in her bosome, yet it
might be well enough put by with this; that
there will be still cockle among the Wheat, and
that there was a Traitor among the Twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44057:11"/>
But if these things were done pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
to the Doctrines of that Church, that makes
it lawful to Kill Hereticks, to Depose Princes, to
dissolve the Bonds of Allegiance, and to give
their Dominions to other; then we may more
justly charge the guilt of this day upon the
Church it self.</p>
            <p>It gives very just grounds of suspicion that
the Pope never made any Declaration of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of that Crime, though, as I have been
credibly informed, it was much desired: on the
contrary, two Priests that had engaged in it,
getting beyond-sea, were well received and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for by the Pope even in <hi>Rome</hi> it self. And
the Jesuites have made Prints and Pictures for
<hi>Garnet</hi> as a Saint, and fables of straws that
wrought miracles by virtue of some drops of
Blood that fell on them, which afterwards were
converted into little pictures, have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the World as evidences of his Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
In a word, it is plain that these who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in this Conspiracy, were carried into it by
the Principles of their Religion, and that they
were so far from being condemned for it, that
they were supported and justified both living
and dead for what they did in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44057:11"/>
And that Learned King, though by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God he never felt the effects of the
bloudy rage of that cruel Religion, yet he knew
it well, and therefore upon a solemn occasion he
protested to his Councellours, <hi>That he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much as grant a Toleration of that Religion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Crooks</hi> Reports Term. Trin. 2. Iac.</note>
               <hi>but would spend the last drop of bloud in his body
before he would do it; and pray'd that before any
of his Issue should maintain any other Religion than
what he truly professed and maintained, that God
would take them out of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then, notwithstanding the close manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as well as the secret contrivance of this cursed
Plot, which was so near its execution, that the
whole State both of this Church and Nation was
in a danger, not unfitly expressed by their being
on the <hi>horns of the Vnicorns;</hi> God yet <hi>heard</hi> our
Fathers and delivered them, who have handed
down to us the remembrance of that great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
that he wrought for them on this blessed
day; then all the Royal Family descended from
that King, all the Nobility and Gentry, whose
Ancestours were markt for destruction, all the
Clergy to whose burning that fire was the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner,
unless they resolved to save themselves
by Apostacy, and the whole English Nation that
was then like to have seen so <hi>black a day,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44057:12"/>
have fallen under so <hi>dark a night,</hi> ought all to
joyn together and say, <hi>O give thanks unto the
Lord, for he is gracious, for his mercy endureth
for ever, Amen and Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because <hi>his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought still to pray to him to preserve
us, and to say to him, <hi>Save me from the Lions
mouth,</hi> which is the third thing in my Text. We
believe there is a secret providence that governs
the World, and that discriminates between the
good and the bad, and therefore we ought to
address our selves to that Providence, as well as
to depend on it and submit to it; and since the
Religion that we profess is the Cause of God, and
the dearest of all other things to him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
it to the world, who sealed it with his
own Blood, and in whose hands the government
of all things in Heaven and in Earth was put by
his Father, we may well quiet our minds, amidst
all the fears and apprehensions which melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoughts may suggest to us. God will not
abandon his own work, nor will Christ forget
that which was the purchase of his own Blood.
We may indeed make our selves unworthy of it,
and the cry of our sins may go up so loud to
Heaven, as to drown these softer whispers of
our Prayers and Thanksgivings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:44057:12"/>
It is our contempt of God and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
our unreformed Lives amidst all
the noise we make of the Reformation,
our forgetting past Mercies, and our
insensibility to all the Methods of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, that ought to make
us fear the <hi>Lion's Mouth,</hi> and every
thing else that is dismal and frightful:
and therefore if we would have our
Prayers to be effectual, we must take
care that our Lives may not defeat our
cold and slender Devotions.</p>
            <p>But as we desire to have our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to be heard, so we must take a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
care to join no Endeavours with
them that may argue a distrust of God,
or of our Religion: and while we have
a zeal against Popery, as a bloody, a
rebellious, and a cruel Religion; we
must do nothing to shew that we are
acted by the Spirit of Popery, even
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44057:13"/>
while we seem to oppose it. All Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
to Mens Persons, all desire of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
the thirst of Blood, fierce Zeal,
and indecent Rage, are the Characters
of the Persecuting Spirit that reigns
there: We must not think ill of every
particular Man among them, because
of their Corruptions, which perhaps he
does not know; and if he did know
them, would disown them. We must
think as charitably of men as we can:
for tho' there is very little Charity due
to the complicated Body, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Part of that Church; yet we
owe a great deal to many particular
men in it, who are still in it, because
they have not known the Depths of
Satan; and would very probably for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it, if they saw so well as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44057:13"/>
But above all these, we must never
forget the Station in which God has
put us, as we are Subjects under a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prince, to whom we are tied both
by Divine and Humane Laws: and
even the <hi>Lion's Mouth</hi> it self opening
to devour us, can never excuse us from
our Obligation to submit and suffer, if
God had so ordered it by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that we had not the blessing of
being born under a Prince that is the
<hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> but were born
under one that would deliver us up to
the LION. Much less ought Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
to be so blown into our minds by
ill-disposed men, as to make us forget
our Duty to God and the King.</p>
            <p>Suffer me here to speak this freely,
that the late Rebellion, as it was managed
with a Popish, that is, a Bloody Spirit,
so many of the Arguments that were
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44057:14"/>
used to defend it, were taken from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Authors.</p>
            <p>When we go out of the way of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and Submission, of Obedience, and
of bearing the Cross; when we give
scope to Passion and Rage, to Jealousy
and Mistrust, and upon this Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in our Minds we break out into
Wars and Rebellion; we forget that
the God whom we serve is Almighty,
and can save us either from a devouring
Fire, or a <hi>Lion's Mouth;</hi> and either
will save us from these, or reward us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
for them: We forget that the
Saviour whom we follow, was <hi>made
perfect by Sufferings;</hi> and that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
then truly his Disciples, when we
bear his Cross, even tho' we should be
crushed under it: We forget that our
Religion ought to inspire us with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Life and the World, and with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44057:14"/>
meekness and lowliness of Mind: We
forget that we are the Followers of that
glorious Cloud of Witnesses, who have
<hi>by Faith and Patience inherited the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi>
and have gone to take possession
of the Kingdom that was prepared for
them, through Fire, and through Blood,
but it was their own Blood. And to
sum up all, we forget that our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
was the shaking off of Popery,
that is, a bloody Conspiracy against the
Souls and Bodies of men: against the
Souls of the Weak, and against the
Bodies of the Firm, but Innocent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of this Holy Religion. We are
not to share with them in their Cruelty,
nor imitate them in their Rebellion.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand; If we will
live so suitably to our Religion, that
we may be thereby entitled to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of enjoying it, and of being secure
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44057:15"/>
in it; and if our melancholy apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
make us pray more earnestly to
the Great Author of it, then we may
lie down in quiet; for God will either
make us to dwell in safety, and deliver
us from the <hi>Lion's Mouth;</hi> or if he
gives us up as a Prey, yet at least we
shall even in Death overcome, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Crown of Life.</p>
