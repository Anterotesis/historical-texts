            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT Honorable, the Lord Mayor of the Citie of London, to the communaltie, and Citizens of the same, Iohn Stow Citizen, wisheth long health and felicitie.</head>
            <p>SInce the first publishing of the perambulation of <hi>Kent,</hi> by that learned Gentleman M. <hi>William Lambert</hi> Esquire, I haue hearde of sundry other able persons to haue (according to the desire of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) assayed to doe somewhat for the particular Shires and Connties, where they were borne, or dwelt, of which none that I knowe (sauing M. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> for the Counties of Middlesex, &amp; <hi>Hertford</hi>) haue vouchsafed their labors <pb facs="tcp:18464:3"/> to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good in that behalf. And therefore concurring with the first, in the same desire to haue drawn together such speciall descriptions of each place, as might not onely make vp an whole body of the English Chronographie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our selues: but also might giue occasion, and courage to M. <hi>Camdin</hi> to increase and beutifie his singular worke of the whole, to the view of the learned that be abroade. I haue attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the discouery of <hi>London,</hi> my natiue soile and Countrie, at the desire and perswasion of some my good friendes, aswell because I haue seene sundrie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities my selfe touching that place, as also for that through search of Recordes to other purposes, dyuers written helpes are come to my handes, which few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue fortuned to meete withall, it is a seruice that most agreeth with my <pb facs="tcp:18464:3"/> professed trauelles. It is a duty, that I willingly ow to my natiue mother &amp; Countrie. And an office that of right I holde my selfe bound in loue to bestow vpon the politike body and members of the same: what <hi>London</hi> hath beene of auncient time, men may here see, as what it is now euery man doth behold: <hi>I</hi> know that the argument, being of the chiefe and principall Citie of the land, required the penne of some excellent Artisen, but fearing that none woulde attempt, and finish it, as few haue assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any, I chose rather (amongst other my Laboures) to handle it after my plaine manner, then to leaue it vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Touching the Dedication, I am not doubtfull where to seeke my patrone, since you be a politique estate of the Citie, as the walles &amp; buildinges be the materiall partes of the same. To <pb facs="tcp:18464:4"/> you therefore, doe I addresse this my whole labour, as well that by your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority I may be protected, as warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by your own skill and vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which I haue written, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes that I lacked my desire to the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of some speciall partes; but I trust hereafter that shalbe supplied, and <hi>I</hi> professe (if more touching this worke come vnto me) to afforde it, in all dutie. In the meane time, I recommend this to your view, my laboures to your consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and my selfe to your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, (as I haue professed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life) in this or any other.</p>

               <p>Also in the yeare 1463. the third of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Philip</hi> being Mayor, in a common counsaile, at the request of the well disposed, blessed, and deuout woman, Dame <hi>Agnes For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> widow, late wife to <hi>Stephen Forster</hi> Fishemonger, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Mayor, for the comfort and reliefe of all the poore prisoners, certaine Articles were established. <hi>Inprimis,</hi> that the new works then late edified by the same Dame <hi>Agnes,</hi> for the inlarging of the prison of <hi>Ludgate,</hi> from thenceforth should be had and taken, <pb n="34" facs="tcp:18464:22"/> as a parte and parcell of the saide prison of <hi>Ludgate,</hi> so that both the olde and new worke of <hi>Ludgate</hi> aforesaid, be one prison, gaile, kéeping, and charge for euermore.</p>
               <p>The saide Quadrant strongly builded of stone, by the before named <hi>Stephen Forster,</hi> and <hi>Agnes</hi> his wife, contayneth a large walking place by grounde, the like roome it hath ouer it for lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ouer all a fayre leades to walke vpon, well imbattayled, all for ease of prisoners, to the end they shoulde haue lodging and water frée without charge: as by certaine verses grauen in Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
&amp; fixed on the said Quadrant, I haue read in forme following.<note place="margin">Old verses on Ludgate.</note>

               <p>This plate, and one other of his Armes, taken downe with the old gate, I caused to be fixed ouer the entrie of the said Quadrant, but the verses being vnhappily turned inward to the wall, the like in effect is grauen outwarde in prose, declaring him to bee a Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, because some vpon a light occasion (as a maydens heade in a glasse window) had fabuled him to bee a Mercer, and to haue begged there at <hi>Ludgate,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Of the water gates of name, on the banke of the riuer of Thames. The first from the West towardes the East, is called <hi>Ripa Reginae,</hi> the Quéens bank, or Quéene Hith,<note place="margin">Watergates Queenes hith</note> which may wel be accounted a water gate, &amp; the very chief of this citie, being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon strand or landing place, yet equal with, &amp; of old time as far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling Belins gate, as shalbe shewed in the ward of Quéene Hith.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Downe</hi> gate,<note place="margin">Downe gate.</note> so called (as may be supposed) of the sodaine descending, or downe going of that way from S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Church vpon Walbrooke vnto the Riuer of Thames, whereby the water in the channell there hath such aswift course, that in the <pb n="35" facs="tcp:18464:22"/> yeare 1574. on the fourth of September after a strong shower of rayne, a lad (of the age of 18. yeares)<note place="margin">A lad of 13. yeares old. drowned in a channell at downegate.</note> minding to haue leapt ouer the channell, was taken by the féete and borne downe with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of that narrow streame, and carryed towarde the Thames with such a violent swiftnesse, as no man could rescue or stay him, till he came against a cart whéele, that stood in the water gate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which time he was drowned, and starke dead.</p>
               <p>This was sometime a large water gate, frequented of shippes and other vessels, like as the Quéene Hith, and was a part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as doth appeare by an Inquisition made in the 28. yeare of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, wherein was founde, that aswell corne as fish and all other things comming to the Port of <hi>Downe</hi> gate, were to bee ordered after the customes of the Quéenes Hith, for the kings vse, as also that the corne arriuing betwéene the gate of the Guildhall of the Marchants of <hi>Cullen:</hi> the (Styleyarde) which is East from <hi>Downe</hi> gate, and the house then pertayning to the Archbishoppe of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> West from Baynards castle, was to be measured by the measure and measurer of the Quéenes soke, or Quéene Hith.<note place="margin">Marchants of the Haunce, landed their corne betwixt their house, &amp; the Black friers</note> I reade also in the 19. of <hi>Edward</hi> the thirde, that customes were then to be payde for shippes and other vessels resting at <hi>Downe</hi> gate, as if they roade at Quéene Hith, and as they now doe a Belingsgate. And thus much for <hi>Downe</hi> gate may suffice.</p>
               <p>The next after Downgate (of old time) was called <hi>Wolses</hi> gate<note place="margin">

               <p>Then is there a water gate at the Bridge foote, called <hi>Oyster</hi> gate,<note place="margin">Oystergate</note> of Dysters that were there of old time commonly to be sold, and was the chiefest market for them, and for other shell fishes <pb n="36" facs="tcp:18464:23"/> There standeth now an engine, or forcier, for the winding vp of ter to serue the citie, whereof I haue already spoken.</p>
               <p>The next is the <hi>Bridge gate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bridge gate.</note> so called of <hi>London</hi> Bridge whereon it standeth: This is one of the foure first and principall gates of the citie, and was long before the conquest, when there stood a Bridge of timber: which Gate being weakely made, when the bridge was builded of stone, hath béene often times since repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This gate with the Tower vpon it, in the 1436. fell down, &amp; two of the farthest Arches Southwards also fell therewith, and no man perished or was hurt therewith.

               <p>The next is <hi>Buttolphes</hi> gate,<note place="margin">Buttolphes gate.</note> so called of the parish Church of <hi>S. Buttolph</hi> néere adioyning. This gate was sometime giuen, or confirmed by <hi>William Conqueror,</hi> to the Monkes of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> in these wordes: <q>

               </p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Belingsgate</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Belingsgate.</note> nowe vsed as an especiall Porte or harborow, for small shippes and boates comming thereto, and is now the largest water gate on the Riuer of Thames, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most frequented, the Quéenes Hith being almost forsaken. Now this Gate tooke that name, or of what antiquity the same is, <pb n="37" facs="tcp:18464:23"/> must leaue vncertaine, as not hauing read any auncient recorde thereof, more then that <hi>Geffrey Monmouth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Geffrey Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</note> writeth, that <hi>Belin</hi> a King of the Britans, about 400. yeares before Christes nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie builded this gate, and named it <hi>Belins gate,</hi> after his owne calling: and that when he was dead, his bodie being burned, the ashes in a vessell of brasse, were set vpon a high pinacle of stone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the same Gate. But <hi>Cesar,</hi> and other the Romaine writers, affirme of citties, walles, and gates, as ye haue before heard, and therefore it séemeth to me not to be so auncient, but rather to haue taken that name of some later owner of the place, happily named <hi>Belin,</hi> as Somars Key, Smarts Key, Froth wharfe, and others thereby tooke their names of their owners: of this gate more shall be saide when we come to <hi>Belins Gate</hi> warde.</p>
               <p>Then haue you a Water gate<note place="margin">Watergate by the custome house.</note> on the West side of Woolle wharfe, or Customers Key, which is now of late most beautifully enlarged and built, This gate is commonly called the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, as being at the South end of Water lane.</p>
               <p>One other Water gate there is by the Bulwark of the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">Watergate by the Tower.</note> and this is the last and farthest water gate Eastward, on the Riuer of Thames, so farre as the cittie of <hi>London</hi> extendeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walles: both which last named water gates bee within the Tower ward.</p>
               <p>Besides these common Water gates were diuers priuate wharfes and Keyes<note place="margin">Wharfes and Keyes.</note> all along from the East to the West of this Cittie, on the banke of the Riuer of Thames: Marchants of all nations had landing places, Ware houses, sellers and stowage of their goodes and marchandises, as partly shall bee touched in the Wardes adioyning to the said Riuer, and therefore concerning Gates let this suffice.</p>

The smaller sommes also were paide in star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, which were pence, so called, for other coynes they had none. The antiquitie of this starling penie vsuall in his Realme, is from the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the second: notwithstanding, the <hi>Saxon</hi> coines before the conquest were pence of fine siluer full the weight, and somewhat better then the latter starlings, as I haue tryed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the pence of <hi>Burghrede</hi> king of <hi>Mercia, Aelfred, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and <hi>Edelrod,</hi> kings of the West <hi>Sexons, Plegmond</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and others. <hi>William</hi> the Conquerours<note place="margin">W.

               <p>The first great summe that I read of to be paid in Esterlinges, was in the fift of <hi>Richard</hi> the first, when <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> being prisoner in <hi>France,</hi> proffered for his ransome a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand markes Esterlinges, notwithstanding the Esterling pence were long before.

But the money of <hi>England</hi> was called of the workers and makers thereof: as the <hi>Floren</hi> of gold is called of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> that were the workers thereof: and so the Esterling pence tooke their name of the Esterlinges, which did first make this mony in <hi>England</hi> in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the second.</p>
               <p>Thus haue I set downe according to my small reading in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: these money matters, omitting the imaginations of late writers, of whom some haue saide Esterling money to take that name of a starre, stamped in the border, or ring of the pennie: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some of a birde called a Stare or starling<note place="margin">Starling mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney when it tooke begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this land.</note> stamped in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference: and other (more vnlikely) of being coyned at <hi>Siri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelin</hi>

               <p>That <hi>Marchants</hi> of all Nations had their Keyes and wharfes at this City whereunto they brought their Marchandises before, and in the raigne, of <hi>Henry</hi> the second mine author wrote of his owne knowledge to be true, though for the antiquitie of the citie, he tooke the common opinion. Also that this citie was in his time and afore deuided into wards, had yearly Sherifs, Aldermen, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral courts, and assemblies, &amp; such like notes by him set down, in commendation of the cittizens (whereof there is no question) hee wrote likewise of his owne experience, as being borne &amp; brought vp amongst them.<note place="margin">Thomas Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And concerning Marchandises then thither transported (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of happily may bee some argument) <hi>Thomas Clifforde</hi> (before <hi>Fitz Stephens</hi> time) writing of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, saith to this effect: King <hi>Edward</hi> intending to make his Sepulcher at <hi>Westminster,</hi> for that it was neere to the famous citie of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and the Riuer of <hi>Thames,</hi> that brought in all kinde of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandises, from all parts of the world &amp;c.

Also I reade in diuers records that of olde time no woade was stowed or harbored in this Citty but all was presently solde in the ships, except by licence purchased of the Sheriffes, till of more latter time, to wit, in the yeare 1236. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Bokereil</hi> being Mayor, by assent of the principall Citizens, the Marchants of <hi>Amiens, Nele</hi> and <hi>Corby,</hi> purchased letters insealed with the common seale of the Cittie, that they when they come, might harborow their woades, and therefore should giue the Mayor euery yeare 50. markes starling: and the same yeare they gaue 100. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It followeth in <hi>Fitz Stephen, that the plagues of London in that time were immoderate quaffing among fooles, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten casualties by fire.</hi> For the first, to wit of quaffing, it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth as afore, though greatly qualified among the poorer sort not of any holy abstinencie, but of méer necessitie, Ale and Béere being small, and wines in price aboue their reach. As for preuention of casualties by fire (the houses in this citie being then builded all of timber and couered with thatch of straw or réed) it was long since, thought good policie in our forefathers, wisely to prouide, namely in the yeare of Christ 1189.<note place="margin">Li.

               <p>Then the number of Carres, Drayes, and Coatches, more then hath beene accustomed, the streetes and lanes being strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <pb n="65" facs="tcp:18464:37"/> must needes be daungerous, as dayly experience proueth. I know that by the good lawes and customes of this cittie, shodde cartes are forbidden to enter, except vpon reasonable causes, (as seruice of the Prince, or such like) they be tollerated. Also that the forehorse of euery cariage should bee lead by hande: but these good orders are not obserued. Of old time coatches were not knowne in this Island, but chariots, or Whirlicotes, and they onely vsed of Princes or great estates, such as had their footmen about them: I reade that <hi>Rychard</hi> the second being threatened by the rebelles of Kent, rode from the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to the Myles end,<note place="margin">L.S.

               <p>THe Auncient diuision of this Citie, was into Wardes, or Aldermanries: and therefore I will beginne at the East, and so proceede through the high and most principall streete of the citie, to the west,<note place="margin">The Cite of London deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from east to west.</note> after this manner. First through <hi>Aldgate streete,</hi> to the west corner of S. <hi>Andrewes Church</hi> called Undershaft, on the right hand, and <hi>Lymestreete corner,</hi> on the left, all which is of <hi>Aldgate</hi> warde: from thence through <hi>Cornhill</hi> streete, to the west corner of <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hall,</hi> all which is of <hi>Limestreete</hi> warde: from thence lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the streete, that leadeth to <hi>Bishopsgate</hi> on the right hand, and the way that leadeth into <hi>Grasse</hi> streete on the left, still through <hi>Cornhill</hi> streete, by the Conduite to the west corner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Stockes, all which is in <hi>Cornhill</hi> warde, then by the saide Stockes (a market place both of fish and flesh standing in the middest of the Citie)<note place="margin">The stockes market the midst of the Citie.</note> through the <hi>Poultrie,</hi> (a streete so called) to the great conduite in west <hi>Cheape,</hi> and so through <hi>Cheape,</hi> to the Standarde, which is of <hi>Cheape</hi> warde, except on the South <pb n="83" facs="tcp:18464:46"/> side from <hi>Bow</hi> lane, to the saide Standarde, which is of <hi>Cord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wainer</hi> streete ward. Then by the Standarde to the great crosse which is in <hi>Cripplegate</hi> warde, on the North side, and in <hi>Bred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streete</hi> warde on the south side. And to the little conduite by <hi>Paules</hi> gate from whence of olde time, the saide high streete stretched straight to <hi>Ludgate,</hi> all in the warde of <hi>Faringdon</hi> within, then deuided truely from East to West, but since that by meanes of the burning of <hi>Paules Church</hi> which was in the raigne of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the first surnamed Conqueror. <hi>Mawricius</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London,</hi> layde the foundation of a new church, so far in largenes exceeding the olde, that the way towardes <hi>Ludgate</hi> was thereby greately streightened, as before I haue at large discoursed: Now from the North to the South,<note place="margin">The Citie de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This water was called (as I haue said) Walbrooke,<note place="margin">The course Walbrooke</note> of running through, &amp; from the wal the course whereof to prosecute it particularlie, was and is from the said wal to S. <hi>Margarets church,</hi> in <hi>Lothberry:</hi> from thence beneath the lower part of the Grocers hall, about the east part of their Kitchen, vnder S. <hi>Mildredes</hi> church, somewhat west from the saide Stockes market: from thence through <hi>Buckels berry,</hi> by one great house builded of stone and timber, called the old Bardge. because Barges out of the riuer of Thames were rowed vp so far into this Brooke: on the backside of the houses in <hi>Walbrooke</hi> streete (which streete taketh his name of the saide Brooke:) by the west ende of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> church vpon <hi>Walbrooke,</hi> vnder Horshew Bridge, by the west side of Tallow Chandlers hall, and of the Skinners hall, and so behinde the other houses, to <hi>Elbow</hi> Lane, and by a parte thereof downe <hi>Greenewitch lane,</hi> into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Thames. This is the course of <hi>Walbrooke,</hi> which was of olde time bridged ouer in diuers places, for passage of horses and men, as neede required: but since by meanes of encrochment on the bankes thereof, the channell being greatly streightned, and other noyances don thereunto, at length the same by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent was Arched ouer with bricke, and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Citie thus deuided from East to West, and from North to South: I am further to shew how the same was of olde time broken into diuers partes called wardes, whereof <hi>Fitzstephen</hi> more then foure hundred yeares ago writeth thus. <hi>This Citie</hi> (sayeth hee) <hi>euen as Rome, is deuided into wardes, it hath yearely Shiriffes in steade of Consuls.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the common weale of the said cittie, in time to come, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more largely may appeare in the articles following.</p>
               <p>First if any assemblie, or hastie gathering of the commons of the said Cittie for oppressing or subduing, of misruled people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the said Cittie hereafter shall happen to be called or commanded by the Mayor, Aldermen, and other gouernors and counsellors of the saide cittie for the time being, there is none so conuenient méet and necessarie a place to assemble them in, within the said cittie, as the said Leaden hall, both for largenes of roome, and for their sure defence in time of their counselling together about the premises. Also in that place hath béen vsed the artillerie, Guns, and other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the said cittie to be safely kept in a readines for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> safegard, wealth, and defence of the said cittie, to bee had and occupyed at times when néede required. As also the store of timber for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie reparations of the tenements belonging to the chamber of the said citie, there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly hath beene kept. Item if any triumph or noblenesse were to be done or shewed by the communalty of the <pb n="122" facs="tcp:18464:66"/> cittie for the honour of our soueraigne Lord, the King, and realme, and for the worship of the said cittie, the said Leaden hall is most meete and conuenient place to prepare and order the said triumph therein, and from thence to issue forth to the places therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>Item,</hi> at any largesse or dole of any money made vnto the poore people of this cittie, it hath beene vsed to be done and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the said Leaden Hall,<note place="margin">Leaden Hall a market place for victulers &amp; the people to stand drie.</note> for that the said place is most meete therefore. <hi>Item,</hi> the honorable Father, that was maker of the said hall, had a speciall will, intent and mind, that (as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly said) the market men and women that came to the Cittie with victuailes and other thinges should haue their free standing within the said Leaden Hall in wet weather, to kéepe themselues and their wares dry, and thereby to incourage them and all other to haue the better will and desire the more plenteously to resort to the said Cittie, to victuaile the same. And if the saide Hall should be letten to farme, the will of the said honorable father should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be fulfilled nor take effect. <hi>Item,</hi> if the said place which is the chiefe fortresse and most necessarie place within all the Cittie, for the tuition and safegarde of the same, should be letten to farme out of the handes of the chiefe heades of the same Citie, and especially to an other bodie politique, it might at length by likelihood bee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of discord, and debate betwéene the saide bodies politique, which God defend.</p>
               <p>For these and many other great and resonable causes, which hereafter shalbe shewed to this honourable Court, your said besée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers think it much necessary, that the said Hall be stil in the hands of this cittie, and to be surely kept by sadde and discréet officers in such wise, that it may alway be ready to be vsed and occupyed for the common weale of the said Citie, when need shal require, and in no wise to bee letten to any bodie politique. Thus much for the petition.</p>
               <p>About the yeare 1534. great meanes was made about the Leaden Hall<note place="margin">Leaden hall ment to haue beene made a Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The vse of Leaden Hall in my youth was thus: In a part of the North quadrant on the East side of the North gate, was the common beames for weighing of wooll, and other wares, as had béene accustomed: on the west side the gate was the scales to way meale: the other thrée sides were reserued for the most part to the making and resting of the pageants shewed at midsommer in the watch: the remnant of the sides and quadrantes were imployed for the stowage of wooll sackes, but not closed vp: the lofts aboue were partly vsed by the painters in working for the decking of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants and other deuises, for beautifying of the watch and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the residue of the loftes were letten out to marchantes, the wooll winders and packers therein to wind and pack their wools: And thus much for Leaden Hall may suffice.</p>
               <p>Now on the North of Limestréete warde in the high stréet, are diuers faire houses for marchants, and proper tenements for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, with an alley also called Shaft Alley, of the shaft or May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole sometime resting ouer the gale thereof, as I haue declared in Aldegate warde. In the yeare 1576 partly at the charges of the parish of <hi>S. Andrew,</hi> and partly at the charges of the chamber of <hi>London,</hi> a water pumpe<note place="margin">A pumpe in the high street of Limestreet warde.</note> was raised in this high stréet of Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stréete warde, néere vnto Limestréet corner: for the placing of the which pumpe, hauing broken vp the ground, they were forced to digge more then two fadome déepe before they came to any maine ground:<note place="margin">Cornehil street in some place raysed 2, fadom higher then of old time, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dings founde so deep.</note> where they found a harth made of Britaine (or Romayne) tyle as they call it, euery tile halfe yarde square and about two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thicke: they found cole lying there also, (for that lying whole will neuer consume) then digging one fadome into the maine they found water sufficient, and set vp the pumpe. Thus much for the high stréete.</p>
               <p>In <hi>S. Mary</hi> streete<note place="margin">S. Mary street.</note> had ye of old time parish Church of <hi>S. Mary</hi> the virgine, <hi>S.

Mary</hi> at the Axe, of the signe of an Axe, ouer against the East end thereof, or <hi>S. Marie Pellipar</hi> of a plot of ground lying on the North side thereof, pertayning to the Skinners in <hi>London.</hi> This parrish about the yeare 1565. was vnited to the parish Church of <hi>S. Andrew Vndershaft,</hi> 
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:18464:67"/> and so was <hi>S. Mary</hi> at the Axe suppressed, and letten out to bee a warehouse for a Marchant. Also against the North end of this <hi>S. Mary</hi> stréete was sometime one other parish Church of <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Parish church of S.

The parishioners of this Church were appointed to the parish Church of <hi>Alhallowes</hi> in the wall, which is in Breadstreet ward, this brotherhood (called <hi>Papey</hi>) being suppressed, the church of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> was pulled downe, and in place thereof one <hi>Grey</hi> a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarie builded a stable, and a heyloft: it is now a dwelling house, reseruing the Church yarde for a garden plot. Those two parish Churches both lying in the Warde of Limestréet, being thus sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, there is not any one parish church or place for diuine seruice in that warde, but the inhabitants thereof repayre to Churches, out of their Ward, namely to <hi>S. Peter</hi> vpon Cornehill in Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill warde, <hi>S. Andrew</hi> in <hi>Aldegate</hi> warde, <hi>Alhallowes</hi> in the wall in Breadstréete warde, and some to <hi>S. Denis</hi> in <hi>Langborne</hi> warde. Now because of late there hath beene some question, to what ward this Church or chappel of <hi>S. Augustine Papie</hi> should of right belong, for the same hath béen challenged by them of <hi>Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> warde, and without reason taken into Bishopsgate warde, from Limestréete warde, I am somewhat to touch it. About 30. yeares since the chamber of <hi>London</hi> granted a lease of ground (in these words) lying néere <hi>London</hi> wall in the ward of Limestréet,<note place="margin">Houses by London wall, in the warde of Limestreet.</note> from the West of the said church or chappell of <hi>S.

               <p>Then haue ye a fayre Conduite of swéete water, castellated in the middest of that warde and streete.

               <p>Of the name of this streete, called the Poultrie, I haue before spoken as also of the lane called Skalding house, or Skalding wike &amp;c.

               <p>In the yeare 1411. the Custos or Gardian, and the Brethren of this Companie, purchased of the Lord <hi>Robert Fitzwaters,</hi> one plot of ground with the building thereupon in the saide Conyhope <pb n="213" facs="tcp:18464:111"/> lane for 320. markes, and then laide the foundation of their new common hall.</p>

               <p>Wherupon proclamation was made, that who so wold bewray the doers therof, shuld haue fortie crownes: but nothing came to light. The Image of the blessed virgin at the time robbed of her son, and her armes broken by which shee staied him on her knées, her whole bodie also was strained with ropes so as it was readie to fall: But was in the yeare 1595. againe fastened and repaired. In the yeare 1596. about Bartholomewtide, a new Sonne mishapen (as borne out of time) was laide in her armes. The other Images remaining broken as before.</p>
               <p>On the East side of the same Crosse, the steppes being taken thence, vnder the Image of Christes resurrection, was set vp a curious wrought frame of grey Marble, and in the same an Image in Alablaster of a woman, (for the most part naked) and Thames water<note place="margin">Thames wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conueyed to the Crosse in Cheape.</note> prilling from her breasts: but the same is oft times dryed vp.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Mauricius</hi> deceased in the yeare 1107. <hi>Richard Beamor</hi> succéeded him in the Bishoppricke, who did wonderfully increase the said church, purchasing of his owne cost, the large stréetes and Lanes about it, wherin were wont to dwel many laye people, which ground he began to compasse about, with a strong wall of stone and gates. King <hi>Henry</hi> the first gaue to the said <hi>Richard,</hi> so much of the Mote (or Wall) of the castle, on the Thames side to the South, as should be néedfull to make the said wal of the church, and so much as should suffise to make a wall without the way on the North side, &amp;c.</p>

This matter was in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> referred to <hi>Haruius de Stanton,</hi> and his fellow Iustices <hi>Itenerantes:</hi> but I finde not the decision or iudgement of that controuersie.</p>
               <p>True it is, that <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in the seuentéene of his raigne, gaue commandement for the finishing of that wall, which was then performed, and to this day it continueth.

               <p>The stéeple of this church was builded and finished in the yeare 1222. The crosse on the said stéeple fell downe, and a new was set vp in the yeare 1314.

               <p>Then was there on the North side of this church yarde, a Charnell house<note place="margin">Charnel house with a Chapel.</note> for the boanes of the dead, and ouer it a chapell of an olde foundation, such as followeth.

               <p>The chapell and Charnill were conuerted into dwelling hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, ware houses, and sheads for Stacioners, builded before it, in place of the Tombes.

               <p>The common spéech then was, that he did set an hundred pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon a cast at dice against it, and so wonne the saide Clocheard and belles of the King: and then causing the belles to be broken as they hoong, the rest was pulled downe and broken also.

               <p>In place of this Clochearde, of olde times, the common Bell of the citie<note place="margin">Common bell of the Citie.</note> was vsed to be roong for the assembly of the citizens, to their Folke motes as I haue before shewed.

On the North side of this Priory, is the lane, truelie called Long, which reacheth from Smithfield towards Aldersgate streete, the rest of Smithfield, from long lane<note place="margin">Long lane.</note> ende to the Bars is inclosed with Innes, Brewhouses, and large tenements on the west side is Chicken lane<note place="margin">Chiken lane.</note> downe to Cowbridge.<note place="margin">Cow bridge.</note>

In the 6. of <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, a new building was made in this west part of Smithfielde betwixt the said Poole and the Riuer of the Wels, or Turnemill Brooke, in a place (then called the Elmes,<note place="margin">The Elmes in Smithfielde a place wherein Trespassers. were executed</note> for that there grew many Elme trees) and this had beene the place of execution for Offendors: since the which time the building there hath beene so increased, that now remaineth not one tree growing.</p>
               <p>Amongst these new buildinges is Cowbridge streete, or Cow lane, which turneth toward Oldbourne, in which lane, the Prior of Semperingham had his Inne or London lodging.</p>

               <p>One other feast was likewise there kept, in the yere 1531. the 23. of king <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. the Sergeants then made were in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 11. namely, <hi>Thomas Audeley, Walter Luke, I.

               <p>These knightes Templars<note place="margin">Originall of the Thmplars.</note> tooke their beginning about the yeare 1118. in manner following. Certaine noble men, horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, religiously bent, bound by vow themselues in the handes of the Patriarke of <hi>Iherusalem,</hi> to serue Christ after the manner of Regular Chanons in chastitie &amp; obedience, and to renounce their own proper wils for euer: she first of which order were <hi>Hugh Paganus,</hi> and <hi>Geffery de S.

               <p>Many noble men in all parts of Christendome, became Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of this order, and builded for themselues Temples in euery ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or great Towne.

               <p>These Templars at this time were in so great glorie, that they entertayned the Nobilitie, forraine Ambassadors, and the Prince himselfe, very often, insomuch that <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> crieth out on them for their Pride, who being at the first so poore, as they had but one horse to serue two of them, (in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whereof they gaue in their Seale,<note place="margin">Seale of the Templars.</note> two men riding vpon one horse,) yet suddainely they waxed so insolent, that they disdayned other orders, and sorted themselues with Noble men.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edwarde</hi> the first in the yeare 1163. taking with him <hi>Robert Waleran,</hi> and other came to the Temple, where calling for the Keeper of the Treasure house, as if hee ment to see his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Iewels, that were laide vp there, to bee safely kept hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the house, breaking the Coffers of certaine persons that had likewise brought their money thether, and hee tooke away from thence to the valew of a thousand pound.</p>
               <p>Many Parliamentes<note place="margin">Parliament at the New Temple.</note> and great Counsailes haue been there kept as may appeare by our histories.

The Archbishop bought <hi>Norwich</hi> house, or <hi>Suffolke</hi> place, neere vnto Charing Crosse, because it was neere vnto the Court, and left it to his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. Now on the south side to returne back again towards the bridge. Ouer against this Suffolke lane is the parrish Church of <hi>S. George,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Parish church of S.

There lie buried in this Church <hi>William Kerton</hi> Esquire, and his wiues 1464.</p>
               <p>Then is the white Lyon a Gaole<note place="margin">White Lion a Gaole for Surrey.</note> so called, for that the same was a common hosterie for the receit of trauellers by that signe: This house was first vsed as a Gaole within these fortie yeares last, since the which time the prisoners were once remoued thence to an house in Newtowne, where they remained for a short time, and were returned backe again to the foresaid White Lyon, there to remaine as in the appointed Gaole for the Countie of <hi>Surrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next is the Gaole or prison of the kinges Benche,<note place="margin">Kings Bench.</note> but of what antiquitie the same is I knowe not.

                  <hi>Couentry,</hi> and there sate by the space of a moneth, as Iustice of the kings Benches, and caused to be indighted in that Court, about the number of two thousand persons of that country, &amp;c.<note place="margin">H. Kinghlon.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It séemeth therefore, that for that time, the prison or gayle of that court was not farre off. Also in the yeare 1392. the sixtéenth of the same <hi>Richard,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> beeing Lord Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor, for good will that he bare to his citie, caused the Kings Bench and Chauncery to be remooued from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Yorke,</hi> but ere long they were returned to <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>More, about the Feast of Easter next following, <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> hauing caused all the whole Nauy of <hi>England,</hi> to bee gathered togither at <hi>London:</hi> It chaunced a certaine Esquire, to kill one of the ship men, which act, the other shipmen taking in ill part, they brought their suite into the kings court of the Marshalsey, which then as chaunsed (saith mine Author) was kept in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke:</hi> but when they perceiued that Court to bee too fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the murtherer, and further, that the Kings warrant was also gotten for his pardon, they in great furie ranne to the house, wherein the murtherer was imprisoned, brake into it,<note place="margin">Saylers brake vp the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalsey.</note> and brought forth the prisoner, with his Gyues on his legges: then thrust they a knife to his heart, and sticked him, as if he had béene a <pb n="238" facs="tcp:18464:173"/> Hogge, then after this, they tyed a rope to his Gyues, and drew him to the gallowes, where when they hanged him, as though they had done a great act, they caused the Trompettes to bee soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before them to theyr Shippes, and there in great triumphe they spent the rest of the day.</p>
               <p>Also the Rebels of <hi>Kent,</hi>

On all sides, without the houses of the Suburbes, are the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens Gardens and Orchards, planted with trées, both large, sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and adioyning togither. On the North side, are pastures, &amp; plaine medows, with brookes running through them, turning water mils, with a pleasant noyse. Not far off, is a great Forrest, A well wodded Chase, hauing good couert for Harts, Buckes, Does, Boores, and wilde bulles. The corne fields are not of a hungry sandie mould, but as the fruitfull fields of <hi>Asia:</hi> yéelding plentifull encrease, and filling the barnes with corne.

               <p>Now on the East side, and by North of the Tower, lyeth East-Smithfield, Hogs stréete, and Tower hill: and East from them both, was the New Abbeycalled Grace, founded by <hi>Edward</hi> the third.

An other day the Quéene founde them meat and drinke: afterward the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> then the Abbot of <hi>Westminster,</hi> of <hi>S. Albones, Waltham,</hi> and others.

On the which place the said <hi>Robert</hi> builded the late new church, with the rest of the stones that were left of the said Tower. And thus the blacke Fryers left their Church and house by Oldborne, and departed to their new. This old Fryer house (<hi>iuxta</hi> Holborne saith the Pattent) was by King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, in the 16. of his raigne giuen to <hi>Henry Lacy</hi> Earle of <hi>Lincolne.</hi>

               <p>CIties and well peopled places bee called <hi>Oppida,</hi> in Latine, eyther <hi>ab ope danda,</hi> or <hi>ab opibus,</hi> or <hi>ab opponendo se ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibus.</hi> They be named also <hi>ciuitates a coeundo,</hi> and (<hi>vrbes</hi>) either of the word <hi>vrbare,</hi> because the first inclosure of them was described with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> draught of a Plow.

               <p>The walles of these townes had their name of <hi>vallum,</hi> because at the first they were but of that earth which was cast out of the trench or ditch wherewith they were enuironed.</p>
               <p>But afterward, being made of matter more fit for defence, they were named <hi>a muniendo maenia.</hi> By the Etimologie of <pb n="468" facs="tcp:18464:230"/> these names, it may appeare that common weales, Cities and townes were at the first inuented, to the end that men might leade a ciuile life amongst themselues, and bee saued harmeles against their enemies: whereupon <hi>Plato</hi> saith, <hi>Ciuitates ab initio vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatis causa constitutae sunt.

This thing well saw King <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who in his lawes (<hi>fol.</hi>125.) saith <hi>Burgi et Ciuitates fundata
&amp; edificata sunt, ad tuitione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gentium, &amp; populorum Regni, &amp; idcirco obseruari debent cum omni libertate, integritate, &amp; ratione.</hi> And his predecessors, king <hi>Ethelstane,</hi> and King <hi>Canu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in their lawes (<hi>fol.</hi> 62. <hi>&amp;</hi> 106.) had commanded thus: <hi>Oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da instaurantur &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Séeing therefore that as <hi>Cicero</hi> 2. <hi>officior.</hi> saith, <hi>proxime
&amp; secuudum Deos, homines hominibus maximè vtiles esse possunt.</hi> And that men are congregated into Cities and common wealthes, for honesty and vtilities sake, these shortly be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities that do come by cities, communalties, and corporations. First, men (by this nearenesse of conuersation) are w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drawen from barbarous feritie and force, to a certaine mildnes of manners, and to humanitie and iustice: whereby they are contented to giue and take right, to and from their equalles and inferiors, and to heare and obey their heades and superiors. Also the doctrine of God <pb n="469" facs="tcp:18464:230"/> is more fitly deliuered, and the discipline thereof more aptly to bee executed, in peopled Townes then abroad, by reason of the facilitie of common and often assembling. And consequently, such inhabitantes be better managed in order, and better instructed in wisedome: whereof it came to passe that at the first, they that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled others this way, were called <hi>astuti</hi> of the Gréeke worde (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) which signifieth a Citie, although the tearme be now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the worst part (and do betoken euill) euen as <hi>Tyrannus, Sophista,</hi> and some such other originally good wordes are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len: And hereof also good behauiour is yet called <hi>Vrbanitas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is rather found in Cities, then elswhere. In summe, by often hearing men be better perswaded in religion, and for that they liue in the eye of others, they bee by example the more easily trayned to iustice, and by shamefastnesse restrained from iniurie.</p>
               <p>And whereas common wealthes and kingdomes cannot haue (next after God) any surer foundation, then the loue and good wil of one man towardes an other, that also is closely bred and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Cities, where men by mutuall societie and companying together, do grow to alliances, communalties and corporations.</p>
               <p>The liberall sciences and learninges of all sortes, which be <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina reipublicae,</hi> do flourish only in peopled townes, without the which a realme is in no better case then a man that lacketh both his eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manual</hi> artes, or handie craftes, as they haue for the most part béene inuented in townes and Cities, so they cannot any where els be eyther maintained or amended. The like is to bee saide of Marchandize, vnder which name I comprehende all manner of buying, selling, bartering, exchaunging, communicating of thinges that men néede, to and fro. Wealth and riches (which are truely called <hi>Subsidia belli, &amp; ornamenta pacis</hi>) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased chiefly in Townes and Cities, both to the prince &amp; people.</p>
               <p>The necessitie of the poore and needie is in such places both soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be espied, and hath meanes to be more charitably relieued.</p>
               <p>The places themselues be surer refuges in all extremities of forraine inuasion, and the inhabitantes bee a ready hand and strength of men with munition to oppresse intestine sedition.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, for as much as the force of the warres of our <pb n="470" facs="tcp:18464:231"/> time consisteth chiefly in sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

It séemeth to me that Citizens and Townesmen bee as fitte to be imployed in any of these seruices (that on horsebacke onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the inhabitantes that be drawen out of the Countrie.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, euen as these societies and assemblies of men in Cities and great Townes, are a continuall brydle against ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, which was the cause that <hi>Tarquin, Nero, Dionisius,</hi> and such others haue alwayes sought to weaken them. So (being well tempered) they are a strong forte and bulwarke not onely in the <hi>Aristocratie,</hi> but also in the lawfull kingdome, or iust royaltie.</p>
               <p>At once the propagation of religion, the execution of good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, the exercise of charitie, and the defence of the countrie, is best performed by Townes and Cities: and this ciuile life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth nearest to the shape of that misticall bodie wherof Christ is the heade, and men bee the members: whereupon both at the first, that man of God <hi>Moyses,</hi> in the common wealth of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, and the gouernors of all Countries in all ages sithence haue continually maintayned the same. And to chaunge it were nothing els but to <hi>Metamorphose</hi> the worlde, and to make wild beastes of reasonable men. To stand longer vpon this it were <hi>in re non dubia, vti oratione non necessaria:</hi> and therefore I will come to <hi>London.</hi>

                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:18464:231"/> This Realme hath onely thrée principall Riuers, whereon a royall Cittie may well be situated: Trent in the North, Seuerne, in the Southwest and Thames in the South East: of the which Thames both for the streight course in length reacheth furthest into the bellie of the lande, and for the breadth and stilnesse of the water is most nauigable vp and downe the streame: by reason whereof <hi>London</hi> (standing almost in the middle of that course) is more commodiously serued with prouision of necessaries, then any towne standing vpon any of the other two riuers can be, and both also more easily communicate to the rest of the realme the commodities of her owne intercourse and trafficke.

For if it were remoued more to the west, it should lose the benefit of the ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and if it were seated more towarde the East, it shoulde bee nearer to daunger of the enemie, and further both from the good ayre, and from doing good to the inner parts of the Realme: Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may I omit that none other place is so plentifully watered with springs, as <hi>London</hi> is.</p>

In which respect an Alderman of <hi>London</hi> reasonably (as me thought) affirmed, that although <hi>London</hi> receyued great nourishment by the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Prince, the repaire of the parliament, and Courtes of iustice, yet it stood principally by the aduantage of the situation vpon the riuer: for when as on a time it was told him by a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, that Quéene <hi>Mary</hi> (in her displeasure against <hi>London</hi>) had appointed to romoue with the Parliament and terme to <hi>Oxford,</hi> this plaine man demanded, whether she meant also to diuert the Riuer of <hi>Thames</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> or no? and when the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had answered no, then quoth the Alderman, by Gods grace we shall doe well enough at <hi>London,</hi> whatsoeuer become of the Tearme and Parliament. I my selfe being then a young scholler at <hi>Oxford</hi> did see great preparation made towardes that Tearme and Parliament, and do well remember that the common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and voice was, that they were not holden there, because pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of Hay could not be made in all the Countrey to serue for tenne whole dayes together, and yet is that quarter plentifully stored with Hay for the proportion of the shire it selfe.</p>
               <p>For proofe of the auncient estimation of <hi>London,</hi> I will not vse the authoritie of the British historie, nor of such as follow it, (although some holde it credible enough that <hi>London</hi> was first <hi>Trinobantum ciuitas,</hi> or <hi>Troia noua,</hi> that famous Cittie in our histories, and then <hi>Ludstoune,</hi> and by corruption <hi>London,</hi> as they report) because they bee not of sufficient force to drawe the gaynesayers. Neyther will I stande much vppon that honorable testimony which <hi>Geruas.

And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not now the same or greater causes to draw the like or better estimation, and cherishing, let any man bee iudge, that will take the paines to compare the present estate of <hi>London,</hi> (yet still growing to better, with the former condition of the same.</p>

                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:18464:233"/>It were too much to recite particularly the martiall seruices, that this Citie hath done from time to time: neither do I thinke that they be all committed to writing, onely for a tast (as it were) I will note these few following.</p>
               <p>Almost 60. yeares before the Conquest, a huge Armie of the Danes (whereof king <hi>Sweyne</hi> was the leader,) besieged king <hi>Etheldred</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> (then the which as the storie sayeth then he had none other refuge) but they were manfully repulsed, and a greate number of them slaine.</p>
               <p>After the death of this <hi>Sweyn,</hi> his sonne <hi>Canutus</hi> (afterward king of <hi>England</hi>) besieged <hi>London,</hi> both by Land and Water: but after much labour, finding it impregnable, he departed: and in the same yeare repayring his forces, he girded it with a new siege, in the which the Citizens so defended themselues, and offended him that in the end hée went away with shame.</p>
               <p>In the dissention that arose betwéene king <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, &amp; his father in law Earle <hi>Goodwin</hi> (which was the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest subiect within this land that euer I haue read of.) The Earle with a great Armie came to <hi>London,</hi> and was for all that by the countenance of the Citizens resisted, till such time as the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie made reconciliation betwéene them. About 70. yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conquest <hi>Maude</hi> the Empresse made warre vppon king <hi>Stephen</hi> for the right of the Crowne, and had taken his person prisoner, but by the strength and assistance of the Londoners and Kentishmen, <hi>Maude</hi> was put to flight at Winchester, and her brother <hi>Robert</hi> then Earle of Glocester, was taken in exchange for whome king <hi>Stephen</hi> was deliuered, I dispute not whose right was better, but I auouch the seruice, seeing <hi>Stephen</hi> was in possession.</p>
               <p>The Historie of <hi>VVilliam VValworth</hi> the Maior of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> is well knowne, by whose manhoode and policie, the person of king <hi>Richarde</hi> the second was rescued, the Citie saued, <hi>Wat Tiler</hi> killed,<note place="margin">After the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon opinion of men of late times.</note> and all his stranglers discomfited, in memory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of which seruice the Cittie had a Daggar added to their shielde of Armes, and the Maiors haue beene most commonly si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens knighted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iacke Cade</hi> also hauing discomfited the kinges Armie, that <pb n="475" facs="tcp:18464:233"/> was sent against him, came to <hi>London,</hi> and was there manfully and with long fight resisted, vntill that by the good policie of the Citizens his company was dispersed.</p>
               <p>Finally in the tenth yeare of the raigne of king <hi>Edwarde</hi> the fourth, and not many dayes before the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, <hi>Thomas Neuell,</hi> (commonly called the Bastarde of <hi>Faucon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>) armed a great Company against the king, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied passage through <hi>London,</hi> he assaulted it on diuers parts: but he was repulsed by the Citizens, and chased as far as <hi>Stratforde</hi> with the losse of a great many.</p>

                  </gap> which <hi>London</hi> hath ministred: and I had rather to leaue it to be coniectured at by comparison to be made betwéene it, &amp; othercities, whereof I will giue you this one note for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. In the 12. yeare of the raigne of king <hi>Edward</hi> the 2. it was ordered by Parliament, that euery Citty of the Realme shoulde make out souldiours against the <hi>Scots:</hi> at which tyme <hi>London</hi> was appointed to send 200. men, and <hi>Canterbury</hi> (being then one of our best Citties) 40. and no more. And this proportion of fiue to one, is now in our age increased, at the least fiue to one, both in souldiers and subsidie. As for the other seruices that <hi>London</hi> hath done in times of peace, they are to be measured by consideration of the commodities whereof I will speake anon. In the meane sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son let the estate and gouernment of this Citie be considered to the end that it may appeare that it standeth well with the policie of the Realme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> in his Commentaries is witnes, that in his time the Cities of <hi>Britain</hi> had large Teritories annexed vnto them, and were seuerall estates of them selues gouerned by particular kinges or Potentates, as in <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> et bee: and that <hi>Mandubratius</hi> was king of the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> whose chiefe Citie <hi>London</hi> is taken to haue been: And I find not that this &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was altered eyther by <hi>Caesar,</hi> or his successors, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Countrie became tributorie vnto them: but that it continued vntill at the length the <hi>Britons</hi> themselues reduced all their peoples into one Monarchy, howbeit that lasted not any long <pb n="475" facs="tcp:18464:234"/> season: for vpon <hi>Vortiger</hi> their king came the <hi>Saxons</hi> our Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, and they draue the <hi>Britons</hi> into <hi>Wales, Cornwall,</hi> and <hi>Britaine,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and in processe of Warre deuided the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try amongst themselues into an Eptarchie, or seauen kingdomes, of the which one was called the kingdome of the East <hi>Saxons,</hi> which hauing in manner the same limmites that the Bishopricke of <hi>London</hi> now enioyeth, contayned Essex, Middlesex, and a part of Hertfordshire, and so included <hi>London.</hi> Againe it appeareth that in course of time, and about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now I doubt not (whatsoeuer <hi>London</hi> was in the time of <hi>Caesar</hi>) but that vnder the Eptarchie and Monarchie it hath béene a subiect, and no frée Citie, though happily endowed with some large Priuiledges, for king <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror founde a Portréeue there whose name was <hi>Godfrey</hi> (by which name hee gréeteth him in his Saxon <hi>Chre</hi>) and his office was none other then the charge of a Bayliffe, or Réeue, as by the selfe same name continuing yet in Grauesend, and certaine other places may well appeare. But the Frenchmen vsing their owne language, called him sometime a Prouost, and sometime a Bayliffe, whatsoeuer his name and office were, he was <hi>perpetuus Magistratus</hi> giuen by the Prince, and not chosen by the Citizens, as it séemeth, for what time king <hi>Richarde</hi> the first néeded money towardes his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition in the Holy Land, they first purchased of him the Liberty to choose yearely from amongst themselues two Bayliffes: And king <hi>Iohn</hi> his successor, at their like suite changed their Bayliffes into a Maior, and two sheriffes. To these <hi>Henry</hi> the thirde added Aldermen, at the first elegible yearelie, but afterward by king <hi>E.</hi> the thirde made perpetuall Magistrates, and Iustices of the peace within their wardes, in which plight of gouernment it presentlie standeth. This shortlie as I could is the Historicall and outward estate of <hi>London:</hi> now come I to the inwarde pith &amp; substance.</p>
               <p>The estate of this City is to bee examined by the quantitie and by the qualitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="477" facs="tcp:18464:234"/>The quantitie therefore consisteth in the number of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens which is very great and farre exceedeth the proportion of <hi>Hippodamus</hi> which appointed 10000. &amp; of others which haue set downe other numbers as méete styntes in their opinions to bée well gouerned, but yet seeing both reason and experience haue freed vs from the law of any definite number, so that other things bée <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And if the causes of English re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions be searched out, they shall be found in effect to bee these twaine, <hi>Ambition,</hi> and <hi>Couetousnes,</hi> of which the first raigneth in the mindes of high and noble personages, or of such others, as séeke to be gratious and popular, and haue robbed the heartes of the multitude, whereas in <hi>London</hi> if any where in the worlde, <hi>honos veré onus est,</hi> and euery man rather shunneth then séeketh the Maioraltie which is the best marke amongst them, neyther hath there béene any strong faction, nor any man more popular then the rest, forasmuch as the gouernment is by a Paterne (as it were) and alwaies the fame, how often soeuer they change their Magistrate. <hi>Couetousnes,</hi> (that other Syre of sedition) pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessth the miserable and néedy sort, and such as be naughty packes, vnthrifts, (which although it cannot be chosen, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in a frequent City as <hi>London</hi> is, there shalbée found many) yet beare they not any great sway, séeing the multitude and most part there is of a competent welth, and earnestly bent to honest labour, I confesse that <hi>London</hi> is a mighty arme and instrument to bring any great desire to effect, it it may be won to a mans deuotion: whereof also there want not examples in the English Historie. But forasmuch as the same is by the like reason seruiceable and méete to impeach any disloyall attempt, let it rather be well gouerned then euil liked therfore, for it shal appeare anon that as <hi>London</hi> hath adhered to som rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, so hath it resisted many &amp; was neuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of any one. The quality of this city consisteth eyther in the law &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="478" facs="tcp:18464:235"/> thereof: or in the degrées and condition of the Citizens, or in their strength and riches.</p>
               <p>It is besides the purpose, to dispute, whether the estate of the gouernment here bee a <hi>Democratie,</hi> or <hi>Aristocratie,</hi> for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it bée being considered in it selfe, certaine it is, that in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the whole Realme, <hi>London</hi> is but a Citizen, and no cittie, a subiect and no free estate, an obedienciarie, and no place endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with any distinct or absolute power, for it is gouerned by the same law, that the rest of the Realme is, both in causes Criminall and Ciuill, a few customes onely excepted, which also are to bee adiudged, or foriudged by the common law. And in the assembly of the estates of our Realme (which wée call Parliament) they are but a member of the Comminaltie, and send two Burgesses, for their citie, as euery poore Borough doth, and two knights for their County as euerie other shire doth, and are as straightlie bound by such lawes as any part of the Realme is, for if contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in subsidie of money to the Prince be decréede, the Londoners haue none exemption, no not so much as to assesse themselues: for the Prince doth appoint the commissioners.</p>
               <p>If Souldiers must be mustered, Londoners haue no law to keepe themselues at home, if prouision for the Princes householde bée to be made, their goodes are not Priueledged. In summe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gouernment of <hi>London</hi> differeth not in substance, but in ceremonie from the rest of the Realme, as namely, in the names and choise of their officers, and in their Guildes and Fraternities, established for the maintenance of Handicraftes, and Labourers and for equitie and good order, to bee kept in buying and selling. And yet in these also are they to bée controlled by the general law for by the statutes 28. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. and 1. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Cha.</hi> 15. the pointes of their misgouernment are inquirable by the inhabitants of the Forren shires adioyning and punishable by such Iusticiars as the Prince shall thereunto depute, to conclude therefore the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of <hi>London</hi> for gouernment is so agreeable a <hi>Symphony</hi> with the rest, that there is no feare of dangerous discord to ensue thereby.</p>
               <p>The multitude (or whole bodie) of this populous Citie is two waies to bee considered, generally, and specially, generally <pb n="479" facs="tcp:18464:235"/> they bée naturall subiectes, a part of the commons of this Realme and are by birth for the most part a mixture of all countries of the same, by bloud Gentlemen, Yeomen, and of the basest sorte, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinction: and by profession busie Bées, and trauellers for their liuing in the Hiue of this common welth, but specially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, they consist of these thrée partes, Marchantes, Handicrafts men, and Labourers. Marchandize is also deuided into these thrée sortes, Nauigation, by the which Marchandizes are brought, and carried in and out ouer the Seas, Inuection by the which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are gathered into the Citie, and dispersed from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Countrie by land and negotiation, which I may call the kéeping of a retayling or standing shop. In common speech they of the first sort bée called Marchantes, and both the other Retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Handicraftes men be those which do exercise such artes as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire both labour and cunning, as Goldsmithes, Taylors and Habberdashers, Skinners &amp;c. Labourers and Hirelinges, I cal those <hi>quorum operae non artes emuntur,</hi> as <hi>Tullie</hi> sayeth, of which sorte be Portars, Carmen, Watermen &amp;c. Againe these thrée sortes may be considered eyther in respect of their welth, or number: in welth Marchantes, and some of the chiefe Retaylers haue the first place, the most part of Retaylers, and all artificers: the second or meane place, and Hyrelinges the lowest roome: but in number they of the middle place, be first, and do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arre exceede both the rest: Hyrelinges be next, and Marchantes bee the last. Now, out of this, that the estate of <hi>London,</hi> in the persons of the Citizens, is so frendly interlaced, and knit in league with the rest of the realme, not onely at their beginning by birth and bloude as I haue shewed, but also very commonlie at their ending by life and conuersation (for that Marchantes and rich men being satisfied with gaine doe for the most part) marrie their children into the Countrie, and conuey themselues after <hi>Cicerors</hi> counsell, <hi>Veluti ex portu in agros et possessiones:</hi> I doe inferre that there is not onely no danger towardes the common quiet thereby, but also great occasion and cause of good loue and amitie: out of this, that they bée generally bent to trauell and do flie pouertie, <hi>per mare, per saxa, per ignes,</hi> as the Poet sayeth, I draw hope, that they shall escape the note of many vices, which idle people doe fall into <pb n="480" facs="tcp:18464:236"/> And out of this, that they bee a greate multitude, and that yet the greatest part of them bée neyther too rich not too poore, but doe liue in the mediocritie, I conclude with <hi>Aristotle</hi> that the Prince néedeth not to feare sedition by them, for thus sayeth hee. <hi>Magnae vrbes, magis sunt a seditione liberae, quod in eis dominetur mediocritas, nam in paruis nihil medium est, sunt enim om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vel pauperes vel opulenti.</hi> I am now to come to the strength and power of this Citie, which consisteth partly in the number of the Citizens themselues, whereof I haue spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, partly in their riches, and in their warlike furniture, for as touching the strength of the peece it selfe that is apparant to the eye, and therefore is not to bée treated of.</p>
               <p>The welth and warlicke furniture of <hi>London</hi> is eyther pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke of priuate, and no doubt the common trasure cannot be much there, seeing that the reuenew which they haue, hardly sufficeth to maintaine their Bridge and Conduites, and to pay their officers and seruantes. Their Tolle doth not any more then pay their Fée Ferme, that they pay to the Prince. Their Issues for default of Appearances be neuer leuied, and the profites of their courtes of Iustice, do go to particular mens handes. Arguments hereof bée these twoo: one that they can doe nothing of extraordinarie charge, without a generall contribution: an other that they haue suffered such, as haue borne the chiefe office amongst them, and were become Bankrupt, to depart the Citie, without releefe: which I thinke they neyther would nor could haue done, if the common treasure had sufficed to couer their shame, hereof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wée néede not be afraid. The publike armour and munition of this City remayneth in the Halles of the Companies, as it doth throughout the whole Realme, for a great part in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish churches, neyther is that kept together, but onely for obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the law, which commandeth it, and therefore if that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten danger to the estate, it may (by another law) be taken from them, and committed to a more safe Armourie.</p>
               <p>The Priuate riches of <hi>London</hi> resteth chiefly in the handes of the Marchantes, and Retaylers, for Artificers haue not much to spare, and Labourers hau neede that it were giuen vnto them. Now how necessarie and seruiceable the estate of Marchandize is <pb n="465" facs="tcp:18464:236"/> to this Realm, if may partly appeare by the practise of that peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, politike, and rich Prince king <hi>Henry</hi> the seauenth, of whom <hi>Polidore</hi> (writing his life) sayeth thus, <hi>Mercatores ille saepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numero pecunia multa data gratuitò iuuabat, vt mercatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra (ars vna omnium cunctis aequè mortalibus tum co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moda, tum necessaria) in suo regno copiosior esset.</hi> But chiefly, by the inestimable commodities that grow thereby: for who knoweth not that wee haue extreame néede of many thinges, whereof for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine countries haue great store, and that wee may spare many thinges whereof they haue neede? or who is ignorant of this that wee haue no mines of siluer or golde within our Realme? so that the increase of our coyne, and Bulloine commeth from else where, and yet neuerthelesse we be both fed, clad, and otherwise serued with forreine commodities and delightes, as plentiful as with our domestical: which thing commeth to passe by the meane of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize onely, which importeth necessaries from other countries, and exporteth the superfluities of our own. For seeing we haue no way to encrease our treasure by mines of gold or siluer at home, and can haue nothing without money or Ware from other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries abroad, if followeth necessarily, that it we follow the councel of that good old Husband <hi>Marcus Cato,</hi> saying, <hi>oportet patrem familias vendacem esse, non emacem,</hi> and do carrie more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in value ouer the seas, then wée bring hether from thence: that then the Realme shall receiue that ouerplus in money: but if we bring from beyond the seas marchandize of more value, then that which we do send ouer may counteruaile, then the Realme payeth for the ouerplus in readie money, and consequently is a looser by that ill husbandrie: and therefore in this part great and héedefull regard must be had that <hi>Symmetria,</hi> and due proportion be kept, least otherwise, eyther the Realme bee defrauded of her treasure, or the subiectes corrupted in vanitie, by excessiue importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of superfluous and néedelesse Marchandize, or els that we féele penurie, euen in our greatest plentie and store by immoderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of our owne néedefull commodities. Other the benefites that marchandize bringeth, shall hereafter appeare in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall recitall of the commodities that come by <hi>London:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="466" facs="tcp:18464:237"/> it resteth that I speake a worde of Retaylors, and finally shew that much good groweth by them both. The chiefe parte of retayling is but a handmaid to marchandize, dispersing by péece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale that which the marchant bringeth in grosse: of which trade be Mercers, Grocers, Uinteners, Haberdashers, Ironmongers, Millayners, &amp; all such as sell wares growing or made beyond the seas: &amp; therefore so long as Marchandize it selfe shalbe profitable, &amp; such proportion kept as neyther wée loose our treasure thereby, nor bee cloyed with vnnecessarie forrein Wares, this kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayling is to be retayned also.</p>
               <p>Now that Marchantes and Retaylers of <hi>London</hi> be very rich and greate, it is so farre from any harme, that it is a thing both praise worthie, and profitable: for <hi>Mercatura</hi> (sayeth <hi>Cicero</hi>) <hi>si tenuis est, fordida putanda est, sin magna est &amp; copiosa non est vituperanda.</hi> And truely Marchantes and Retaylers doe not altogether <hi>intus Canere,</hi> and profit themselues onely, for the Prince, and Realme both are enriched by their riches: the Realm winneth treasure, if their trade be so moderated by authority, that it breake not proportion, &amp; they besides beare a good fléece which the Prince may sheare when shée séeth good,</p>
               <p>But heere before I conclude this part, I have shortly to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the accusation of those men, which charge <hi>London</hi> with the losse and decay of many (or most) of the auncient Cities, Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Townes, and Marketes within this Realme, by drawing from them to her selfe alone (say they) both all trade of traffique by sea, and the retayling of wares, and exercise of manuall artes also. Touching Nauigation, which (I must confesse) is apparantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in many port townes, and flourisheth only<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or chiefly at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I impute that, partly to the fall of the Staple (the which bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long since a great trade, and bestowed sometimes at one town and sometimes at an other within the Realme, did much enrich the place where it was: &amp; being now not onely diminished in force, but also translated ouer the seas, cannot but bring some decay with it (partly to the empayring of Hauens, which in many places haue empouerished those Townes, whose estate doth ebbe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>low with them, and partly to the dissolution of Religious houses, <pb n="467" facs="tcp:18464:237"/> by whose welth and haunt, many of those places were chiefly fed and nourished. I meane not to rehearse particular examples of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery sorte: for the thing it selfe speaketh, and I hast to an ende: As for Retaylers therefore, and Handicraftes men, it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile if they abandon Countrie Townes, and resort to <hi>London:</hi> for of nonely the Court, (which is now a dayes much greater and more gallant then in former times, and which was wont to bee contented to remain with a smal company, sometimes at an Abbey or Priorie, sometimes at a Bishops house, and sometimes at some meane Mannor of the kings own) is now for the most part eyther abiding at <hi>London,</hi> or els so neare vnto it, that the prouision of thinges most fit for it, may easily be fetched from thence: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by occasion thereof the Gentlemen of all shires do flie, and flocke to this City, the yonger sorte of them to sée and shew vanitie, and the elder to saue the cost and charge of Hospitality, and house kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. For hereby it commeth to passe that the Gentlemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyther for a good portion of the yeare out of the Countrie, or playing the Fermours, Grasiars, Brewers or such like, more then Gentlemen were wont to doe within the Countrie, Retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Artificers, at the least of such thinges as pertaine to the backe or belly, do leaue the Countrie townes where there is no vent, and do flie to <hi>London,</hi> where they be sure to finde ready and quicke market. And yet I wish, that euen as many townes in the Low Countries of king <hi>Phillips</hi> do stand some by one handy arte and some by an other: so also that it might be prouided here, that the making of some thinges might (by discrete dispensation) be allotted to some speciall Townes, to the end, that although the dayntenesse of men cannot be restrayned, which will néedes séeke those thinges at <hi>London,</hi> yet other places also might bee reléeued, at the least by the Workemanshippe of them.</p>
               <p>Thus much then of the estate of <hi>London,</hi> in the gouernment thereof, in the condition of the Citizens, and in their power and riches. Now follow the enumeration of such benefites as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound to the Prince and this realme by this City: In which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I professe not to rehearse all, but onely to recite and runne ouer the chiefe and principall of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:18464:238"/>Besides the commodities of the furtherance of Religion and Iustice: The propagation of Learning: The maintenance of artes: The increase of riches, and the defence of Countries (all which are before shewed to grow generally by Cities, and bee common to <hi>London</hi> with them) <hi>London</hi> bringeth singularlie these good thinges following.</p>
               <p>By aduantage of the scituation it disperseth forraine Wares (as the stomacke doth meat) to all the members most commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</p>
               <p>By the Benefite of the riuer of Thames, and greate trade of Marchandize, it is the chiefe maker of Marriners, and Nurse of our Nauie: and ships (as men know) bee the wodden walles for defence of our Realme.</p>
               <p>It maintayneth in florishing estate, the Countries of Norfolke, Suffolke, Essex, Kent, and Sussex, which as they lie in the face of our most puissant neighbour, so ought they (aboue others) to be conserued in the greatest strength and riches: and these (as it is well known) stand not so much by the benefite of their own soile, as by the neighbourhood and nearenes which they haue to <hi>Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It releeueth plentifully, and with good policie, not onely her owne poore people (a thing which scarcely any other Towne or shire doth) but also the poore that from ech quarter of the realme do flocke vnto it, and it imparteth liberally to the necessitie of the Uniuersities besides. It is an ornament to the realm by the bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof, &amp; a terror to other countries by reason of the greate welth and frequencie. It spreadeth the honor of our Countrie far abroade by her long nauigations, and maketh our power feared, euen of barbarous Princes. It onely is stored with rich Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes which sort onely is tollerable: for beggerlie Marchants, do byte too neare, &amp; will do more harme then good to the realme. It onely of any place in this realme is able to furnish the sodaine necessitie with a strong Army. It auaileth the prince in Tonnage, Poundage and other her customes, much more then all the rest of the Realme.</p>
               <p>It yeeldeth a greater Subsidie then any one part of the realme, I meane not for the proportion of the value of the goodes onely, <pb n="469" facs="tcp:18464:238"/> but also for the faithfull seruice there vsed, in making the assesse, for no where else bee men taxed so neare to their iust value as in <hi>London:</hi> yea manye are founde there, that for their countenaunce and credite sake, refuse not to bee rated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue their abilitie, which thing neuer happeneth abroade in the countrie. I omit that in auncient time, the inhabitantes of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and other cities, were accustomably taxed after the tenth of their goodes, when the Countrie was assessed at the fiftéenth, and rated at the viij.when the countrie was set at the xij.for that were to awake a sléeping Dogge, and I should be thought <hi>dicenda, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenda, locutus,</hi> as the Poet said.</p>
               <p>It onely doth and is able to make the Prince a ready prest or loane of money.</p>
               <p>It onely is founde fit and able to entertaine strangers honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, and to receaue the Prince of the realme worthely.</p>
               <p>Almightie God (<hi>qui nisi custo diat ciuitatem, frustra vigilat custos</hi>) grant, that her Maiestie euermore rightly estéeme and rule this Citie, and he giue grace, that the Citizens may answere duty, aswell towards God and her Maiestie, as towardes this whole realme and countrie, <hi>Amen.</hi>

         <div type="appendix">
            <head>An Appendix containing the examination of such causes as haue heretofore moued the Princes, eyther to fine and ransome the citizens of London, or to seize the liberties of the City it selfe.</head>
            <p>THese all may be reduced to these few heads: for eyther the citizens haue adheared (in aide or armes) to such as haue warred vpon the Prince: or they haue made tumult, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the common peace at home: or they haue misbehaued themselues in point of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement and iustice: or finally (and to speake the plain truth) the princes haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hold of small matters, and coyned good summes of money out of them.</p>
            <p>To the first head I will referre whatsoeuer they haue done ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="470" facs="tcp:18464:239"/> in those warres that happened betwéene king <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Maude</hi> the Empresse, being competitors of the crowne: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene king <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; his nobles assisting <hi>Lewes</hi> the French kinges sonne when he inuaded the realme: for it is apparent by all histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that the Londoners were not the mouers of these warres, but were onely vsed as instruments to maintaine them. The like is to be said of all the offences that king <hi>Henry</hi> the third (whose whole raigne was a continuall warfare) conceyued against this Cittie, concerning the bearing of armour against him; for the first part of his raigne was spent in the continuation of those warres that his father had begun with <hi>Lewes.</hi> And the rest of his life he bestowed in that contention, which was commonly called the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons warres. In which Tragedie <hi>London</hi> (as it could not bee otherwise) had now and then a part, and had many a snubbe at the kinges hand for it. But in the end when hee had triumphed ouer <hi>Simon Mountford</hi> at <hi>Euesham, London</hi> felt it most tragicall: for then he both seysed their liberties, and sucked themselues drie: and yet <hi>Edictum Kenelworth</hi> (made shortly after) hath an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable testimony for <hi>London,</hi> saying, <hi>Te London laudamus &amp;c.</hi> As for the other offences that hee tooke against the Londoners, they pertaine to the other parts of my diuision.</p>
            <p>Next after this, against whom the Londoners did put on armes, followeth king <hi>Edward</hi> the second, who in the ende was depriued of his kingdome, not by their meanes, but by a generall defection, both of his owne wife and sonne, and almost of the whole nobilitie and realme besides. In which trouble, that furious assault, and slaughter committed by them vpon the Bishop of <hi>Excester</hi> (then Treasurer of the Realme) is to be imputed, partly to the sway of the time wherewith they were caried, and partly to a priuate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure which they had to the Bishop.</p>
            <p>Finally commeth to hand King <hi>Richard</hi> the second: for these thrée onley in all the Catalogue of our kinges, haue béene heauie Lordes to <hi>London,</hi> who also had much contention with his nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and was in the ende deposed. But whatsoeuer countenance and aide the Citie of <hi>London</hi> brought to the warres and vprores of that time, it is notoriously true that <hi>London</hi> neuer ledde the dance, but euer followed the pipe of the nobility. To close vp this <pb n="471" facs="tcp:18464:239"/> first part therefore I affirme, that in all the troublesome actions during the raignes of these thrée kinges, as also in all that heauing in, and hurling out, that afterward happened betwéene K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. &amp; king <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, the citie of <hi>London</hi> was many times a friende and fautor, but neuer the first motiue or author of any intestine war or sedition.</p>
            <p>In the second roome I place a couple of tumultuous affraies that chaunced in the daies of King <hi>Richard</hi> the first, the one vpon the day of his coronation against the Iewes, which contrary to the Kings owne proclamation, would néedes enter the Church to sée him sacred, and were therefore cruelly handled by the common people. The other was caused by <hi>William</hi> with the long beard, who after that he had inflamed the poore people against the richer sort, and was called to answere for his fault, tooke Bow Church for sanctuarie, and kept it Castle like, till he was fiered out.</p>
            <p>Here is place also for the stoning to death of a Gentleman (ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to the halfe brother of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third) which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prouoked the Citizens to furie by wounding diuers of them without any cause 1257. for the riotous fray betwéene the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the Goldsmithes and the Taylors, 1268. for the hurlie burlie and bloodshed betwéen the Londoners and the men of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> moued by the youngmen vpon an occasion of a wrestling on <hi>S. Iames</hi> day, 1221. &amp; made worse by one <hi>Constantine</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Citizen: for the braule and businesse that arose about a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers loafe at <hi>Salisbury</hi> place 1391. for the which and some other misdemeanors K. <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. was so incensed by euill counsell against the Londoners, that he determined to destroy them, and raze their Citie, and for the fight that was betweene the citizens &amp; Sanctuarie men of <hi>S. Martins</hi> 1454. vnder K. <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt. And finally for the misrule on euill May day 1519. and for such other like, if there haue beene any.</p>
            <p>To the third head may be referred the seiser of their liberties, for a false iudgement giuen against a poore widow, called <hi>Margaret Viel</hi> 1246. The 2. seueral seisers in one yere 1258. for fals pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in collections of money and other enormities: And finally the seiser made by King <hi>Edward</hi> the first for taking bribes of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers 1285. But all this seueritie in seising and resuming of the <pb n="472" facs="tcp:18464:240"/> liberties (which was in old time the onely ordinary punishment) was at length mitigated by king <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth in their statutes before remembred.</p>
            <p>In the last place stand those offences, which I repute rather taken then giuen, and do fall within the measure of the adage, <hi>vt canem cedas, cito inuenias baculum:</hi> for King <hi>Iohn</hi> in the tenth of his raigne deposed the Bayliefes of <hi>London,</hi> because they had bought vp the Wheate in the market, so that there was not to serue his Purueyers. King <hi>Henry</hi> the third his sonne compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Londoners to pay him 5000. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. because they had lent to <hi>Lewes</hi> the French the like summe, of a good mind to dispatch him out of their Citie and the realme, at such time as the Protector and the whole Nobility fell to composition with him for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And the same King fined them at thrée thousand markes, for the escape of a prisoner out of <hi>Newgate,</hi> of whom they tooke no charge: for he was a Clearke, prisoner to the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> vnder the custody of his owne seruants, and as for the place, it was onely borrowed of the Londoners to serue that turne. Hitherto of these things to this ende, that whatsoeuer misdemeanor shalbe obiected out of historie against <hi>London,</hi> the same may herein appeare, both in his true place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
