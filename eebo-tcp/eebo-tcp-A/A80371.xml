            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS UPON THE BILL for the Relief of Poor PRISONERS, Humbly ſubmitted to the Wiſdom of the High COURT of PARLIAMENT Now Sitting.</head>
            <p>ONE would think in a Chriſtian State nothing can be urged againſt ſo ſeaſonable, humane, and pious a Deſign, as the Relieving of poor inſolvent Priſoners, having no Sanctuary left but the King and Parliaments to reſcue them from the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Unreaſonable Men, ſuch as abuſe Law into Tyranny, and Juſtice into Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. Men without Humanity, who to gratify their Tyrannical Temper, crow'd the Jayls of <hi>England</hi> with inſolvent Priſoners, and there let them ſtarve and periſh, that their Lives may go for their Debts. Men that deſerve to be exploded from humane Society, as the Reproach and Blemiſh of a free Nation, and a Scandal to Chriſtianity. The Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof has from time to time induced the Government, to relieve ſuch Priſoners as could ſwear themſelves not worth 5 (or 10) Pounds.</p>
            <p>The main Objection made againſt thoſe Gracious Acts, is, That they occaſion <hi>Perjury</hi> in Men of no Principles, ſuch as will readily purchaſe their Liberty at the price of their own Souls. But, with Submiſſion, That Miſchief may be prevented, if not altogether, at leaſt in a great meaſure, by making <hi>Perjury</hi> in this Caſe <hi>Felony.</hi> The Fear of an infamous Death, which alone deters ſo many Men from felonious Acts, would probably make them prefer a confined Life before an airy Death, and a ſociable (tho a nauſeous) Priſon to a ſilent melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Grave.</p>
            <p>But, unleſs ſuch an Act of Grace do reach inſolvent <hi>Abſconders,</hi> who to ſhun the Cruelty of their ſevere Creditors confine themſelves out of their Reach, 'tis humbly conceived, 'twill be but half an Act of Grace. For the Condition of <hi>Abſconders</hi> is little better than that of actual <hi>Priſoners;</hi> they being both confined, neither of 'em free to act abroad, to provide for themſelves or Families, and all equally a Burden to themſelves, their Friends, and the State it ſelf. Only with this Difference, That actual <hi>Priſoners</hi> are ſo by force, and <hi>Abſconders voluntary;</hi> the firſt forced into Priſon by Law, and the laſt before-hand with it.</p>
            <p>It ſeems moreover requiſite, That a Courſe were taken for a future Reſtraint of <hi>Arreſts.</hi> Otherwiſe 'tis to be feared, an Act of Grace will prove but a palliating Cure, and ſuch as will not reach to the Root of the Diſeaſe. In other Nations, no Debtor is Arreſted (but in caſe of Bankrupcy) before he has had three Summons to appear before a Judge, in order to own the Debt, and take care to pay it, for which he is allowed Time. Upon failure of which, he may be either Arreſted, or his Goods Seized. But, if he be thrown into a Jayl, the Creditor muſt allow him a Maintenance ſutable to his Rank; and, when that fails, his Priſoner is of Courſe ſet at Liberty. Which Method, practiſed even in <hi>France</hi> a Slaviſh Kingdom, and in <hi>Holland</hi> as trading a People as any, looks like Chriſtian Juſtice.</p>
            <p>I conclude with this Obſervation, That many amongſt actual <hi>Priſoners</hi> and <hi>Abſconders</hi> have ruined themſelves in the Service oſ the Publick with their utmoſt Induſtry, and others by Misfortunes. Which may prove a further Inducement to bring ſo charitable a Work to Perfection, as an Act of Grace. Whereby all inſolvent Debtors may be enabled to provide For their Families, to ſerve the State, and not be (as they are) a chargeable Excreſcence of it, and to put themſelves in a Condition to do Juſtice to every one.</p>
            <p>But, if this Bill proves only a Temporary, and not a Perpetual Act, all <hi>Jaylors, Bayliffs,</hi> and <hi>Sollicitors</hi> for 'em will have their aim, who are another great Grievance of this Nation. Men who at this very time uſe their utmoſt Indeavours, and turn every Stone to have it but a Temporary Act, without any Reſtriction for the future, that they may have a freſh Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of grinding the Poor, and cruſhing the Oppreſſed.</p>
