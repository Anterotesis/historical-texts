            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

your Profeſſion, living in Love, and endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, you will cauſe my latter days to be most ſweet and comfortable to me, after all thoſe Troubles, Sorrows, and Reproaches I have met with, both from within and from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.

            <p>My Brethren, I here preſent you with that which you have ſo long waited for, and deſired me to endeavour to do, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſtate an account of the most concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Articles of your Faith, which you have heard read, and have approved of, and which I thought


<pb facs="tcp:40608:4"/>
good no longer to delay the doing of. (1.) Not knowing how ſoon I may put off this Tabernacle, and therefore would leave behind me an account of that holy Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Order, in which through Grace you are eſtabliſhed (for at your deſire alſo I have drawn up the whole Rules of your holy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which you may have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto this, and bound up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether). (2.) And the rather I have done this, becauſe the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and more Large Confeſſion of the Faith of our Churches, is now out of Print; but that is not all, for that being <hi>12 d.</hi> price, ſome cannot well purchaſe it. (3.) And alſo that all Men may ſee what our Faith is, and that we differ not from our Brethren who bear other Names in any Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Point or Article of Faith; and that they may diſcern the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between you and ſome that bear the ſame Name with you.


<pb facs="tcp:40608:5"/>
(4.) Tho you agree in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with all other Churches of the ſame Faith, in all thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles there inſerted, yet therein your whole Faith is not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Impoſition of Hands upon baptized Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as ſuch, and ſinging of God's Praiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe ſome of our Churches diſſent from us therein: yet my deſire is you would nevertheleſs ſhew all Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, Charity and Moderation to ſuch as differ from you in thoſe Caſes, and not refuſe Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them; and indeed your late ſweet Temper appears to be ſuch, that I need not preſs you to this. All that I ſhall ſay more, is to entreat you to labour after Holineſs, and to awake out of ſleep, that you may adorn your ſacred Profeſſion, and prepare to meet the Lord; that as you have a good Doctrine, you may alſo have a holy and good Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

and then we need not fear who can harm us, whilſt we are followers of that which is good, O let us bear one with another. and if in any thing we differ, let us avoid all Animoſities.

            <p n="1">1. Fundamentally in Chriſt, as a common Perſon of all the Elect before Faith, which lieth in Chriſt making full Satisfaction for all their Sins, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting Faith for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Actual, of all the Elect in Chriſt on believing; this actual Pardon being nothing elſe but the actual Poſſeſſion in their own Perſons of their funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Pardon in the Perſon of Chriſt: And Dr. <hi>Tho. Goodwin</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, to which I agree. And that


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40608:25"/>
this actual Pardon of the legal Guilt is twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Formal, of all their Sins paſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving their legal Guilt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Virtual, of all their Sins to come, preventing their legal Guilt. Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, and many others. I cannot ſee how a Believer ſhould be for ever formally juſtified from all Sins paſt, preſent, and to come, and yet not formally pardoned.</p>
            <p>This Author which I have lately met with, diſtinguiſheth well between Legal Guilt and Goſpel Guilt; the firſt obliging to Divine Wrath, or eternal Puniſhment; the latter, <hi>i. e.</hi> Goſpel Guilt, obliging to Goſpel, or Fatherly Chaſtiſement for Goſpel-Sins. Now I ſee not but <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith, that not only the Sins of a juſtified Perſon that are paſt are remitted, but alſo in ſome ſort thoſe to come, <hi>Num. 23. 25. Joh.</hi> 5. 24. yet he diſtinguiſhes between a formal and virtual Pardon: Sins paſt, ſays he, are remitted in themſelves, Sins to come, in the Subject o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Perſon ſinning.</note> that as ſoon as a Believer is perſonally juſtified, all his Sins, tho not yet commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as to legal Guilt, or vindictive Wrath, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Guilt that obliges to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condemnation, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, for the reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Saith he, <hi>Virtual Pardon keeps off Legal Guilt where it would be.</hi> To which I reply, if it be kept off, ſo


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40608:25"/>
that it never comes upon Believers, then it follows they were actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd before in that reſpect: yet he ſays, Sins cannot be ſaid to be formally pardon'd before formally committed; but ſays, <hi>no Guilt can come upon them to Condemnation, tho new Guilt;</hi> yet no new legal Guilt, becauſe always juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. We ſee no hurt if his Terms be admitted.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>What do Believers then pray for, when they pray for the Pardon of Sin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That God would not chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe them ſorely, or afflict them as a Father, according to the greatneſs of their Offences.</p>
            <p>2. That if his chaſtning Hand is upon us, he would be pleaſed graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to remove it.</p>
            <p>3. That he would be pleaſed to clear up to our Conſciences, or give us the evidence of our Pardon through Chriſt's Merits, and that we may know we are compleat in Chriſt, or without ſpot before the Throne in our free Juſtification.</p>
            <p>4. Nay, Believers are to pray to God to remove that Sin from them (ſaith this worthy Author) whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of Puniſhment cannot be removed from it; and to ſpread their Sins before the Lord in the higheſt ſenſe of the


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40608:26"/>
deepeſt demerit of all legal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that they may put the higher accent upon the free Grace of God, and eſtimate upon the full Satisfaction of Chriſt, whereby their Perſons are ſo fully freed from all actual Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any Legal Puniſhment, the whole and utmoſt whereof their Sins deſerve.</p>
            <p>5. Moreover, that God would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and never revoke his moſt gracious Pardon, till he pronounceth the final Sentence of it at the day of Judgment, (as well this Author notes) for a renewed ſenſe and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of its grant and continuance: and thus to pray, ſaith he, there are both Precepts and Promiſes.</p>
