            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>RIght Honourable, the
kingdome of heauen, of
which the scripture spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
so oft, is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a certaine state or condition,
whereby wee stand in the fauour
and loue of God, in and by
Christ. And this kingdome is
compared to a Graine of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterd-seede,
to teach vs that a
man is euen at that instant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
entred into the kingdome
of heauen, when the Lord that
good husbandman hath cast but
some little portion of faith or
repentance into the ground of
the heart; yea, though it be but
<pb facs="tcp:14014:3"/>
as one graine of musterd-seede.
Of this little graine I haue pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this Treatise, in quantitie
answerable thereto: and I now
present the same to your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe,
not to supplie your want,

            <head>A GRAINE
of Musterd-seede, Or, the
least measure of grace, that
is, or can be effectuall
to Saluation.</head>
            <p>IT is a very necessary point
to be knowne, <hi>what is the
least measure of grace that
can befall the true childe of
God, lesser then which, there is
no grace effectuall to saluation.</hi>
For first of all, the right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of this point, is
the very foundation of true
comfort vnto all troubled &amp;
touched co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is a notable meanes to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14014:4"/>
stirre vp thankefulnesse in
them that haue any grace at
all; when they shall in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of then selues consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that they haue receiued
of God the least measure of
grace, or more. Thirdly, it
will be an inducement, and a
spurre vnto many carelesse
and vnrepentant persons, to
embrace the gospel, and to
beginne repentance for their
sinnes; when they shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
and that by the word
of God, that God accepts
the very seeds and rudiments
of faith and repentance at
the first, though they be but
in measure as a Graine of
Musterd-seed. Now then for
opening and clearing of
this point: I will set downe
fiue seuerall conclusions, in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14014:4"/>
such order as one shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
and explane the other,
and one depend vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <head type="sub">A man that doth but beginne to

though inwardly hee be more

               <div type="exposition">
                  <head>The Exposition.</head>
                  <p>IN a man there must be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
three things, the
substance of the body and
soule, whereof man is saide
to consist; the faculties pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the soule and exercised
in the body, as vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
will, affections: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14014:5"/>
tegritie and puritie of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
whereby they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the will of God
and beare his Image. And
since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> man is
not depriued of his substance
or of the powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his soule, but onely of
the third, which is the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or integritie of nature.
And therfore the conuersion
of a sinner, whereof the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
speaketh, is not the
change of the substance of
man, or of the faculties of the
soule: but a renewing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
of that puritie and
holinesse which was lost by
mans fall, with the abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that natural corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is in all the powers
of the soule. This is the
worke of God, and of God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14014:5"/>
alone, and that on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
First of all, when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
God to worke a change
in any, he doth it not first in
one part, then afterward in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
as hee that repaires a
decaied house by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale:
but the worke, both
for the beginning, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and accomplishment, is
in the whole man, and euery
part at once, specially in the
minde, conscience, will, and
affections: as on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary,
when <hi>Adam</hi> lost the image of
God, he lost it in euery part.
Secondly, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion of a
sinner is not wrought all at
one instant, but in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of time: &amp; that by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
measures and degrees.
And a man is then in the
first degree of his conuersion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14014:6"/>
when the holy Ghost by the
meanes of the word, inspires
him with some spirituall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp; begins to regenerate
and renew the inward pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of his soule. And he may
in this case very fitly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the night in the
first dawning of the day, in
which though the darkenes
remaine and be more in qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
then the light, yet the sun
hath alreadie cast some bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of light into the aire,
whereupon we tearme it the
breaking of the day. Now
then, the very point which I
teach, is that a man at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and in this very state
(God as yet hauing but laid
certen beginnings of true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
in his heart) is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
child of God, and that not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14014:6"/>
only in the eternall purpose
of God (as all the elect are)
but indeed by actuall adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and this is plain by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
reason: There be foure
speciall workes of grace in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
child of God: his vnion
with Christ, his adoption, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and conuersion: &amp;
these foure are wrought al at
one instant, so as for order of
time, neither goes before nor
after other: and yet in regard
of order of nature, vnion
with Christ, Iustification, and
adoption, goe before the
inward conuersion of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
it beeing the fruit and
effect of all. Vpon this
it followeth necessarily, that
a sinner in the very first act of
his conuersion, is iustified, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted,
and incorporated
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14014:7"/>
into the misticall bodie of
Christ. In the Parable of the
prodigall sonne, the father
with ioy receiues his wicked
child; but when? surely when
he saw him comming a farre
off, and when as yet he had
made no confession or humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
to his father, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had conceiued with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a purpose to returne
and to say, Father I haue
sinned against heauen and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, &amp;c. And <hi>Paul</hi>
saith of many of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
that he could not
speake vnto them as spiritual
men, but as carnall, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> babes
in Christ, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. When
<hi>Dauid</hi> reprooued by <hi>Nathan</hi>
did but begin to repent and
to say, <hi>I haue sinned,</hi> presently
<hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14014:7"/>
Lord said, <hi>The Lord hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away thy sin,</hi> Of this thing
<hi>Dauid</hi> seemes to speake in
the 32. Psal. v. 5. <hi>I said</hi> [that is,
I purposed and thought with
my selfe] <hi>I will confesse against
my selfe mine vnrighteousnesse,
and thou forgauest mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
Vpon these words <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
saith, <hi>Marke, he doth
not confesse, but promiseth to
confesse, &amp; God forgiueth him.</hi>
Againe, <hi>There be</hi> (saith he)
<hi>three syllables,</hi> peccaui, <hi>I haue
sinned: and from these three
syllables the flame of a sacrifice
did ascend into heauen before
God.</hi> Chrysostome saith, <hi>Say
thou hast sinned: and thou hast
loosed thy sinne.</hi> And <hi>Ambrose</hi>
saith: <hi>If he said, I will confesse,
and obtained pardon before he
confessed, how much more when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14014:8"/>
he had confessed, saying, I know
mine iniquitie, was his sinne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
Gregorie on this Psal.
saith, <hi>Marke how speedily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
comes, and how great is the
commendation of Gods mercie,
in that pardon comes together
with the desire of confession, and
remission comes to the heart,
before confession breake forth in

of Gods spirit, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after the worke of the
law vpon the conscience, and
rise vpon the meditation of
the Gospell, that promiseth
righteousnes and life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
by Christ: out of which
motions the conuersion of a
sinner ariseth, and of which it
consisteth: what these are, it
shall afterward appeare. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
grace must be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished:
it is two-fold; restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
grace, or renuing grace.
Restraining grace, I tearme
certaine common gifts, of
God, seruing onely to order
and frame the outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
of men to the Law
of God, or seruing to bereaue
men of excuse in the day of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14014:9"/>
iudgement. By this kind of
grace, heathen men haue bin
liberall, iust, sober, valiant, &amp;
mercifull. By it men liuing in
the Church of God, haue
beene inlightned, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
tasted of the good word
of God, haue reioyced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and for a time outwardly
conformed themselues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Renewing grace is not
common to al men, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the elect, &amp; it is a gift
of Gods spirit, whereby the
corruption of a sinner is not
only restrained, but also mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
and the decaied image
of God restored in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
and true holines. Now
then the conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be vnderstoode of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and not of the first: for
though a man haue neuer so
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14014:10"/>
much of this restraining
grace, yet vnlesse he haue the
spirit of Christ to create faith
in the heart, and to sanctifie
him, he is as farre from salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as another. Thus then
the sense and meaning of the
conclusion is, that the verie
lest measure of sauing grace,
and the verie beginning or
seedes of regeneration doe
declare, and after a sort giue
title to men, of all the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
promises of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they concern this life or
the life to come: &amp; are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
approoued of God, if
they be in truth; and accepted
as greater measures of grace.
That which our Sauiour
Christ saith of the worke of
miracles, Math. 17. 20. <hi>If ye
haue faith as a graine of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterd-seede,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14014:10"/>
ye shall say vnto this
mountaine, remooue hence to
yonder place, and it shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue,</hi>
must by the law of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
proportion be applied
to sauing faith, repentance,
the feare of God, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
graces? if they be truly
wrought in the heart, though
they be but as smal as one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
graine of Musterd-seede,
they shall be sufficiently effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
to bring forth good
workes, for which they are
ordained. The prophet <hi>Esay
42.</hi> 3. saith, that Christ <hi>shall
not quench the smoking flaxe,
nor breake the bruised reede,</hi>
Let the comparison be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
fire in flaxe must be
both little and weake in qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
as a sparke or twain, that
cannot cause a flame, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14014:11"/>
a smoke, specially in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so easie to burne. Here the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is signified, that the gifts and
graces of Gods spirit, that are
both for measure &amp; strength
as a sparke or twaine of fire,
shal not be neglected, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accepted and cherished
by Christ. When our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ heard the young
man make a confession of a
practise but of outward and
ciuill righteousnesse, <hi>he looked
vpon him and loued him:</hi> Mark.
10. 21. and when he heard the
scribe to speake discreete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but one good speech, that
to loue god with all the heart
is aboue all sacrifices, he said
vnto him. <hi>That he was not for
from the kingdome of heauen.</hi>
Therefore no doubt, he will
loue with a more speciall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14014:11"/>
loue, and accept as the good
subiects of his kingdome,
those that haue receiued a
further mercie of God, to be
borne a new of water and the
spirit.</p>

               <head type="sub">A constant and earnest desire to

                  <p>LVst or desire is two folde,
naturall, &amp; supernaturall.
Naturall is that whose begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and obiect is in nature,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14014:12"/>
that is, which ariseth of the
naturall will of man, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
such things as are
thought to be good accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the light of nature.
And this kind of desire hath
his degrees, yet so as they are
all limited within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of nature. Some desire
riches, honours, pleasures,
some learning &amp; knowledge,
because it is the light and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the minde: some
go further &amp; seeke after the
vertues of iustice, tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
liberality, &amp;c. and thus many
heathen men haue excelled.
Some againe desire true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
as <hi>Balaam</hi> did, who
wished to die the death of the
righteous: because it is the
propertie of nature to seeke
the preseruation of it selfe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14014:12"/>
But here nature staies it selfe:
for where the mind reueales
not, the will affects not. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
desires, are such
as both for their beginning
and obiect, are aboue nature.
For their beginning is from
the holy Ghost; and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
or matter about which
they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersant, are things
diuine and spirituall which
concerne the kingdome of
heauen: and of this kinde are
the desires of which I speake
in this place. Againe, that we
may not be deceiued in our
desires, but may the better
discerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from flittering
and fleeting motions, I adde
three restraints. First of all,
the desire of reconciliation,
the desire to beleeue, or the
desire to repent &amp;c. must be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14014:13"/>
constant and haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
otherwise it may iustly
be suspected. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, it must
be earnest &amp; serious, though
not alwaies, yet at somtimes,
that we may be able to say,
with <hi>Dauid,</hi> My soule desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
after thee, O Lord, as the
thirsty land. <hi>And,</hi> as the hart
braieth after the riuers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so panteth my soule after
thee O God, my soule thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
for God, euen the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God. Thirdly, it must
be in a touched heart; for
when a man is touched in
conscience, the heart is cast
downe, and (as much as it
can) it withdrawes it selfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
God. For this cause, if then
there be any spirituall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whereby the heart is lift
vp vnto God they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14014:13"/>
doubt from the spirit of
God. Thus then I auouch,
that the desire of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God in Christ, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
it selfe: the desire
to beleeue, is faith indeede: &amp;
the desire to repent, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it selfe. But marke how.
A desire to be reconciled, is
not reconciliation in nature,
(for the desire is one thing, &amp;
reconciliation is another) but
in Gods acceptation: for if
we being touched throughly
for our sins, do desire to haue
them pardoned, and to bee at
one with god, God accepts vs
as reconciled. Againe, desire
to beleeue, it is not faith in
nature, but onely in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
God accepting the
will for the deede. That this
doctrine is the will and word
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14014:14"/>
of God, it appeares by these
reasons. First of all, God hath
annexed a promise of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes,
&amp; of life euerlasting,
to the desire of grace. Mat.
5. <hi>Blessed are they which hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst after righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
for they shall bee satisfied</hi>
Ioh. 7. 38. <hi>If any man thirst, let
him come to mee and drinke.</hi>
Reuel. 2. 1. <hi>I will giue vnto him
which is a thirst, of the well of
the water of life freely.</hi> Now
what is this to thirst? pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
it is, when wee are in a
drought or drines, and want
drinke to refresh vs, &amp; desire
it. And therefore by all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance,
they are saide to
thirst after righteousnes, that
want it, and would faine haue
it: And they thirst after christ
that feele themselues out of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14014:14"/>
Christ, and desire, yea long
after the blood of Christ, that
they might be refreshed with
it in their consciences. Here
then we see, that the desire of
mercy, in the want of mercy,
is the obtaining of mercie:
and the desire to beleeue, in
the want of faith, is faith.
Marke then: though as yet
thou want firme and liuely
grace, yet art thou not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
voide of grace, if thou
canst vnfainedly desire it, thy
desire is the seede, concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or bud of that which thou
wantest. Now is the spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
of the ingrafted word or
the immortall seede cast into
the furrowes of thy heart:
waite but a while, vsing the
good meanes to this ende ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and thou shalt see
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14014:15"/>
the leaues, blossomes, &amp; fruit
will shortly follow after. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly,
the desire of any good
thing is accepted of God, as
the liuely inuocation of his
holy name, Psal. 10. <hi>God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the desire of the poore.</hi> Psal.
145. <hi>He will fulfill the desire of
him that feareth him.</hi> When
<hi>Moses</hi> said nothing, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desired in heart the helpe
and protection of God at the
redde sea, the Lord said vnto
him, Why criest thou vnto
me? <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 15. And when
wee know not to pray as wee
ought, <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that the
spirit maketh request by the
inward groanes of the heart,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. Hence I gather,
that when a man in his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
praies with sighes and
groanes, for the gift of liuely
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14014:15"/>
faith, the want whereof hee
findes in himselfe, his very
praier on this manner made,
is as truly in acceptation with
God, as a praier made in
liuely faith. And here it is
further to be considered, that
<hi>Paul</hi> calls these <hi>groanes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable,</hi>
and why? Of most
interpreters they are thought
to be vnspeakable, by reason
of their greatnesse, and this
I will not denie: it seemes
neuerthelesse that they are
so tearmed by reason of
their weakenesse, for they
are commonly small, weake,
and confused in the hearts of
Gods children when they
are distressed: and the words
following seeme to import
thus much: for when it had
beene said that Gods spirit in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14014:16"/>
vs makes request with grones
not to be vttered: some man
might happily reply and say,
if we cannot discerne and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
these grones in our selues
what are we the better? <hi>Paul</hi>
addes therfore, that although
we know not, yet God a sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of all things hidden in
the heart, knowes the minde
and meaning of the spirit.
And thus the wordes yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
afoard a comfortable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to the children of
God, namely, that beeing in
distresse, whether in life or
death, if by grace we can but
sigh or sob vnto God, though
it be weake and feeble like the
faint pulse in the time of
death; we, or the spirit of God
in vs, doe indeede make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
vnto God that shall bee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14014:16"/>
heard, yea, (as the words are)
wee doe more then make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest:
and though we do not
alwaies see what Gods spirit
makes vs to sigh after, yet god
doeth. To the testimonie of
Scripture, I adde the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of godly and learned
men, not to prooue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in hand; but to shew a
consent, and to prooue thus
much, that the thing which I
auouch, is no priuate phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie
of any man <hi>Easily</hi> (saith

this crosse, to giue our bodies
to be burnt euen for the truthes
sake.</hi> More testimonies might
be alleadged, but these shall
suffice.</p>
                  <p>Against this point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14014:21"/>
it may be alleadged, that
if desire to beleeue in our
weakenesse be faith indeede;
then some are iustified and
may be saued wanting a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehension and full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of Gods mercie in
Christ. <hi>Ans.</hi> Iustifying faith in
regard of his nature is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
one and the same, and
the essentiall propertie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is, to apprehend Christ
with his benefites, and to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And therefore without
some apprehension and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
there can bee no iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
or Saluation in them
that for age are able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.
Yet there bee certaine
degrees and measures of true
faith. There is a strong faith,
which causeth a full appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14014:21"/>
and perswasion of
Gods mercie in Christ. This
measure of faith the Lord
vouchsafed <hi>Abraham, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
Paul,</hi> the Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and Martyrs of God.
It were a blessed thing if all
beleeuers might attaine to
this height of liuely faith, to
say with <hi>Paul,</hi> I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that neither life, nor
death, nor any thing else, shal
bee able to separate vs from
the loue of God in Christ:
but all cannot; therfore there
is another degree of faith
lower then the former, and
yet true faith, called a litle or
weake faith, and it also hath a
power to apprehend and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
the promise of saluation,
but as yet by reason of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
it is infolded (as it were)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14014:22"/>
and wrapt vp in the heart, as
the leafe and blossome in the
bud. For such persons as haue
this weake faith, can say in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
that they beleeue their
sinnes to be pardonable, and
that seriously in their hearts
they desire to haue them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned:
but as yet they can
not say, that they are without
all doubt pordoned. And yet
the mercie of God is not wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vnto them. For in that
they doe, and can desire, and
indeauour to apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, they
doe indeed apprehend; God
accepting the desire to doe
the thing, for the thing done,
This which I say will the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
appeare, if the groundes
thereof be considered. Faith
doth not iustifie in respect of
it selfe, because it is an action
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14014:22"/>
or vertue: or because it is
strong, liuely, and perfect: but
in respect of the obiect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
namely Christ crucified,
whom faith apprehendeth
as he is set forth vnto vs in the
word and Sacraments. It is
Christ that is the author, and
matter of our iustice, and it is
he that applieth the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs: as for faith in vs, it is but
an Instrument to apprehend
&amp; receiue that which Christ
for his part offereth and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.
Therefore, if faith erre
not in his proper obiect,
but follow the promise of
God, though it doe but
weakely apprehend, or at the
least, cause a man onely to
Endeauour and Desire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
it is true faith, and
iustifieth. Though our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14014:23"/>
be necessarie, yet
our saluation stands rather in
this, that God apprehends vs
for his owne, then that we
apprehend him for ours. <hi>Phi.
3.</hi> v. 12. And rather in this,
that we are knowne of him,
then that we know him. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Out of this conclusion springs an
other not to be omitted, that
God accepts the endeauour
of the whole man to obey, for
perfect obedience it selfe.</head>
                     <p>THat is, if men endeauour
to please God in all
things, God will not iudge
their doings by the rigour of
his law: but will accept their
litle and weake endeauour, to
do that which they can do by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14014:23"/>
his grace, as if they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
fulfilled the lawe. But
heere remember I put this
caueat; that this indeeuour
must bee in and by the whole
man; the very minde, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,

to obey which is a
fruit of the spirit, shall bee
distinguished from ciuil righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
which may bee in
heathen men, and is onely in
the outward, and not in the

this conclusion appeares by
that which the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi>
saith, that God will spare
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that feare him, as a father

                  <p>SVndry persons by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists
are said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
which had onely seene
the miracles of Christ, and as
yet had made no further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
but to acknowledge
Christ to be the Messias; and
to submit themselues to him
&amp; his doctrine, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
should be taught. On
this maner the woman of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria
belieued, and many of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14014:26"/>
the Samaritans vpon her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port:
and a certaine ruler, by
reason of a miracle wrought
vpon his sonne, is said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
and all his houshold.
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 42. 52. When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ commended the
faith of the Apostles, terming
it a rocke, against which the
gates of hell should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
it was not the plentifull
knowledge of the doctrine of
saluation: for they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of many articles of faith,
as namely of the death, resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
ascention, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ: but because
they beleeued him to be the
sonne of God, &amp; the sauiour
of mankinde, and they had
withall resolued themselues
to cleaue vnto him, and the
blessed doctrine of saluation
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14014:26"/>
which hee taught, though as
yet they were ignorant in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
points. The holy Ghost
commendeth the faith of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
when shee receiued the
spies. Now this her faith was
indeed but a seed and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of liuely faith: for then
shee had onely heard of the
miracles done in Egypt, and
of the deliuerance of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
and was thereupon
smitten with feare, and had
conceiued a resolution with
her selfe, to ioyne her selfe to
the Israelites, and to worship
the true God. Now these and
the like, are tearmed belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
upon iust cause: for
though they bee ignorant as
yet, yet their ignorance shall
bee no continuing or lasting
ignorance: and they haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14014:27"/>
seedes of grace, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a purpose of hart to cleaue
to Christ, and a care to profit
in the doctrine of saluation,
whereof they haue some litle

                  <p>THe wickednesse of mans
nature, and the depth of
hypocrisie is such, that a man
may &amp; can easily transforme
himselfe into the counterfeit
and resemblance of any grace
of God. Therefore I put
downe in this last conclusion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14014:27"/>
a certaine note, whereby the
gifts of God may be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
namely, that they grow
vp and increase as the graine
of Musterd-seede to a great
tree, and beare fruit answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
The grace in the heart is
like the graine of Musterd-seede
in two things. First it is
small to see to at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
secondly, after it is cast
into the ground of the heart,
it increaseth speedily, and
spreads it selfe. Therefore, if a
man at the first haue but some
litle feeling of his wants, some
weake and faint desire, some
small obedience, he must not
let this sparke of grace goe
out, but these motions of the
spirit must be increased by
the vse of the word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and praier: and they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14014:28"/>
must daily bee stirred vp by
meditating, endeauouring,
striuing, asking, seeking,
knocking. The master deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
his talents to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
saith vnto them: Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie
till I come, aud not
hide in the earth, <hi>Matth. 25.
26, Paul</hi> vseth an excellent
speech to <hi>Timothie:</hi> I exhort
thee to stirre vp the gift of
God which is in thee, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as fire is stirred vp by often
blowing, and putting to
of wood. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. As
for such motions of the heart
that last for a weeke, or a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
and after vanish away,
they are not to bee regarded:
&amp; the Lord by the Prophet
<hi>Ose</hi> complaineth of them,
saying, O <hi>Ephraim,</hi> thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
is like the morning
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14014:28"/>
dewe, chap. 6.</p>
                  <p>Therefore considering,
grace vnlesse it be confirmed
and exercised, is indeede no
grace; I will heere adde cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
rules of direction, that
wee may the more easily put
in practise the spirituall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of inuocation, faith, and
repentance: and thereby also
quicken and reuiue the seeds
and beginnings of grace.</p>
                  <p>1. In what place soeuer
thou art, whether alone or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
by day or by night,
and whatsoeuer thou art do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
set thy selfe in the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of God: let this perswasion
alwaies take place in thy hart
that thou are before the liui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
God: and do thy endeauour,
that this perswasion may
smite thy heart with awe and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14014:29"/>
reuerence, and make thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to sin. This councell the
Lord gaue <hi>Abraham.</hi> Gen. 17.
1. <hi>Walke before me and be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi>
This thing also was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
by <hi>Enoch,</hi> who for this
cause is said <hi>to walke with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Esteeme of euery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
day as of the day of thy
death: and therefore liue as
though thou were dying; and
doe those good duties euery
day, that thou wouldest doe
if thou were dying. This is
Christian watchfulnesse; and
remember it.</p>
                  <p>3. Make catalogues and
bills of thine owne sinnes,
specially of those sinnes that
haue most dishonoured God,
and wounded thine owne
conscience: set them before
thee ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, specially then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:14014:29"/>
thou hast any particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of renewing thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
that thy heart by
this dolefull sight may bee
further humbled. This was
Dauids practise when hee
considered his waies, and
turned his feet to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
Psal. 119. 57.
And when he confessed the
sinnes of his youth. Psal. 25,
This was Iobs practise, when
he said he was not able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
one of a thousand of his
sinnes vnto God. Iob. 9. 1.</p>
                  <p>4. When thou first ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
thine eyes in a morning,
pray to God, and giue him
thankes heartily: God then
shall haue his honour, and
thy heart shall be the better
for it the whole day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14014:30"/>
For we see in experience,
that vessels keepe long the
taste of that liquor wherwith
they are first seasoned. And
when thou liest downe, let
that be the last also: for thou
knowest not, whether fallen
a sleepe, thou shalt euer rise
againe aliue. Good therefore
it is, that thou shouldest giue
vp thy selfe into the hands of
God, whilst thou art waking.</p>
                  <p>5. Labour to see and feele
thy spirituall pouerty, that is,
to see the want of grace in thy
selfe, specially those inward
corruptions, of vnbeliefe,
pride, selfe-loue, &amp;c. Labour
to be displeased with thy self:
and labour to feele, that by
reason of them, thou standest
in neede of euery drop of the
blood of Christ to heale and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14014:30"/>
clense thee from those wants:
and let this practise take such
place with thee, that if thou
be demaunded, what in thine
estimation is the vilest of the
creatures vpon earth? thine
heart and conscience may
answer with a loud voice, <hi>I,
euen I, by reason of mine owne
sinnes:</hi> and againe, if thou be
demaunded, what is the best
thing in the world for thee?
thy heart and conscience may
answer againe with a strong
and loud crie, <hi>One drop of the
blood of Christ to wash away my
sinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Shew thy selfe to bee a
member of Christ, and a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of God, not only in the
generall calling of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
but also in the particular
calling in which thou art pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14014:31"/>
It is nothing for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
to be a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man,
but he must also be a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
magistrate: it is not inough
for a master of a family to be
a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man, or a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the Church, but the must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
be a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the family
&amp; in the trade which he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
daily. Not euery one
that is a common hearer of
the word, and a frequenter of
the Lords table, is therefore
a good Christian, vnlesse his
conuersation in his priuate
house, and in his priuate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
&amp; dealings be sutable:
There, is a man to be seene
what he is.</p>
                  <p>7. Search the scriptures,
to see what is sinne, and what
is not sinne in euery action:
this done, carry in thy heart a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14014:31"/>
constant and resolute pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
not to sin in any thing:
for faith and the purpose of
sinning can neuer stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>8. Let thine endeauour be
sutable to thy purpose: and
therefore doe nothing at any
time against thy conscience,
ritely enformed by the word:
exercise thy selfe to eschew
euery sinne, and to obey God
in euery one of his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
that pertaine either
to the generall calling of a
Christian, or thy particular
calling. Thus did good <hi>Iosias,</hi>
who turned vnto God with
all his heart, according to <hi>all</hi>
the lawe of <hi>Moses. 1. King.
25.</hi> 25. and thus did <hi>Zacharie</hi>
and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that walked <hi>in
all</hi> the commandements of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14014:32"/>
God without reproofe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                  <p>9. If at any time against
thy purpose and resolution,
thou bee ouertaken with any
sinne little or great, lie not in
it, but speedily recouer thy
selfe by repentance: humble
thy selfe, confessing thine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and by praier intreat
the Lord to pardon the same,
and that earnestly, till such
time as thou findest thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
truly pacified, and thy
care to eschew the same sinne
increased.</p>
                  <p>10. Consider often of the
right and proper ende of thy
life in this world, which is not
to seeke profit, honour, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but that in seruing of
men, wee might serue God in
our callings. God could, if it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14014:32"/>
so pleased him, preserue man
without the ministry of man,
but his pleasure is to fulfil his
worke and will in the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of our bodies, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of our soules, by the
imploiment of men in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
euery one according to
his vocation. Neither is there
so much as a bond slaue, but
he must in and by his faithful
seruice to his master, serue the
Lord. Men therefore doe
commonly profane their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and liues, by aiming at
a wrong ende, when all their
care consisteth onely in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
sufficient maintenance
for them and theirs, for the
obtaining of credit, riches, &amp;
carnall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities. For thus
men serue themselves, &amp; not
God, or men: much lesse doe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14014:33"/>
they serue God in seruing of
men.</p>
                  <p>11. Giue all diligence to
make thy election sure, and
to gather manifold tokens
thereof. For this cause ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
the worke of Gods
prouidence, loue, and mercy,
both in thee and vpon thee,
from time to time: for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
consideration of them,
and the laying of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when they are many and
seuerall, minister much dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
assurance of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
and comfort. This was
the practise of <hi>Dauid, 1. Sam.</hi>
17 14. Psal. 23. all.</p>
                  <p>12. Thinke euermore thy
present estate whatsoeuer it
bee, to bee the best estate for
thee: because whatsoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
thee, though it bee sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14014:33"/>
or any other affliction, or
death, befals thee of the good
prouidence of God. That
this may the better bee done,
labour to see and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a prouidence of God,
as wel in pouertie as in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
as well in disgrace as
good report, as well in sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
as in health, as well in life
as in death.</p>
                  <p>13. Pray continually, I
meane not by solemne &amp; set
praier, but by secret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
eiaculatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the heart,
that is, by a continuall eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of minde vnto Christ,
sitting at the right hand of
God the Father, and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by prayer or giuing of
thankes so often as any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shall be offered.</p>
                  <p>14. Thinke often of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14014:34"/>
worst and most grieuous
things that may befall thee,
either in this life or death for
the name of Christ: make a
reckoning of them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
thy selfe to beare them:
that when they come, they
may not seeme strange, but
be borne the more easily.</p>
                  <p>15. Make conscience of
idle, vaine, vnhonest and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
thoughts: for these are
the seedes and beginnings of
actuall sin in word &amp; in deed.
This want of care in orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and composing of our
thoughts, is often punished
with a fearefull temptation in
the very thought, called of
Diuines, <hi>Tentatio blasphemia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
a tentation of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>16. When any good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14014:34"/>
or affection riseth in the
heart, suffer it not passe away,
but feede it by reading, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating.
praying.</p>
                  <p>17. Whatsoeuer good
thing thou goest about, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be in word or deed, do
it not in a conceit of thy selfe,
or in the pride of thy heart,
but in humility, ascribing the
power whereby thou doest
thy worke, and the praise
thereof to God, otherwise
thou shalt finde by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
God will curse thy best
doings.</p>
                  <p>18. Despise not ciuill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie:
good conscience and
good maners must goe togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
therefore remember
to make conscience of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of customable swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in common talke: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14014:35"/>
not either in deede or
word with any man, be curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and gentle to all, good
and badde: beare with mens
wants and frailties, as hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
frowardnesse, selfeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
curiousnesse, &amp;c. passing
by them as being not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
returne not euill for
euill, but rather good for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill:
vse meate, drinke, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
in that manner and
measure, that they may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
godlinesse; and may be
as it were signes in which
thou maiest expresse the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
grace of thy heart: Striue
not to goe beyond any, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be in good things: goe
before thine equals in giuing
of honour, rather then in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of it: make conscience of
thy word, and let it bee as a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14014:35"/>
bond: professe no more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hast inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in heart: opresse or defraud
no man in bargaining: in all
companies either doe good,
or take good.</p>
                  <p>19. Cleaue not by inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
affection to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but aboue all things qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
&amp; rest thy mind in Christ,
aboue all dignitie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
aboue all cunning and
policie, aboue all glorie and
honour, aboue all health and
beautie, aboue all wealth and
treasure, aboue all ioy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
aboue al fame &amp; praise,
aboue all mirth and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
that mans heart can
feele or deuise beside Christ.</p>
                  <p>With these rules of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
ioyne rules of meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
whereof I propound sixe
