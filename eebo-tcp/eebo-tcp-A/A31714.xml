            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">John 10 ch. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. ver.</note> 
               <hi>verily, I ſay unto you, He that entreth not by
the Door into the Sheep-fold but climbeth up ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, the ſame is a thief and a robber: But he
that entreth in by the Door is the Shepherd of the
Sheep, to him the Porter openeth, and the ſheep hear his voice,
and he calleth his own ſheep by name, and leadeth them out. And
when he putteth forth his own ſheep he goeth before them, and the
ſheep follow him, for they know his voice; and a ſtranger will
they not follow, for they know not the voice of strangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is worthy of examination whether the ſhepherd of
this place entred in at the door,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſ. </seg>1</label> or climbed up another way
<hi>viz.</hi> Whether he did undermine and thruſt out a worthy
learned Divine, able to inſtruct his flock both in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Welſh;</hi> and climbed into his place through the window a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the good will and liking of his Pariſhioners.</p>
            <p>What good he hath wrought amongſt them ſince his
intruſion,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſ. </seg>2</label> &amp; whether he hath not fleeced them and fed
upon them, more like a ravenous Wolf than a true Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
If ſo, then according to the words of St. <hi>John, He
is a Thief and a Robber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He robbed his elder Brother of his right.</p>
            <p>2. He robbed his Pariſhioners of that Spiritual food
and comfort which they received from his wholſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42686:2"/>
3. He robbed God of his Honor and Glory.</p>
            <p>4. He robbed the poor of that relief which the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Predeceſſor afforded unto them; this unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
man keeping a fierce Dog to terrifie the poor from
coming to his Door, which is open only unto ſuch as are
able, 1. either to feaſt him again: or, 2. To ſupport him
in his pride and uſurpation.</p>
            <p>This Intruder cannot lead his Sheep in the paths of
Righteouſneſs and Holineſs; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſ. </seg>3</label> neither do they know his
voice, it being the voice of a ſtranger, or a ſtrange voice.</p>
            <p>1. He cannot preach or inſtruct his flock in their own
native Language; ſo that they do not underſtand him nor
the meaning of his Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>2. He will not maintain another in his ſtead that can or
might teach and inſtruct his flock.</p>
            <p>3. He may be properly termed a ſtranger, becauſe he
came into the place very ſtrangely, by ſupplanting his
Predeceſſor who was worthy of the place, and his Sheep
did love and honor him, and he was able to go in and out
before them, and to lead them, and his ſheep did willingly
follow him.</p>
            <p>4. It is a ſtrange voice, and not the voice of a true Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
for the true ſhepherd doth feed his ſheep with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
food, and like the true <hi>Samaritan,</hi> doth <hi>pour wine and
oyl into their wounds.</hi> But this ſtranger doth make wounds
and ſores where there were none before; much like
the <hi>Indian</hi> flies that infect and make ſores on every place
where they light upon.</p>
            <p>5. He comes not in to ſave, but to deſtroy his ſheep:
1. by his oppreſſion and vexatious ſuits: 2. By his railing
invectives and ſtrange Doctrines; denouncing his ſheep
Reprobates, becauſe they will not patiently ſuffer him to
fleece and flay them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>6. This ſhepherd is not only barbarous in his dealings
with his Pariſhioners, but alſo according to the words of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42686:3"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> may be properly called a <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>He that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himſelf; but

unto you ſpeaking with Tongues, what ſhall I profit you, except I
ſhall ſpeak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying,
or by Doctrine.</hi>

            <p>Thoſe that come to Church to hear him cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
him, and thoſe that come not are excommunicated; &amp;
if they go to hear thoſe that can inſtruct them in their own

not at the door, but came in another indirect way,
whoſe voice the ſheep do not underſtand, for they know
not the voice of this ſtranger who feeds himſelf and ſtarves
his flock, which leads us to the 34 Chapter of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi>

them, Thus ſaith the Lord God unto the ſhepherds, Wo be to the
ſhepherds of Iſrael that do feed themſelves, ſhould not the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye cloath you with the
wooll: ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the flock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The diſeaſed have ye not ſtrengthned, neither have you heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My ſheep wandred through all the mountains and upon every
high hill; yea, my flock was ſcattered upon all the face of the
earth, and none did ſearch or ſeek after them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore ye ſhepherds, hear the word of the Lord. As I
live, ſaith the Lord, Surely becauſe my flock became a prey, and
my flock became meat for every beaſt of the field, becauſe there
was no ſhepherd, neither did my ſhepherds ſearch for my flock.
But the ſhepherds feed themſelves, and feed not my flock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore O ye ſhepherds, hear the words of the Lord, Thus
ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I am againſt the ſhepherds, and I
will require my flock at their hand, and cauſe them to ceaſe from
feeding the flock, neither ſhall the ſhepherds feed themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, for I will deliver my flock from their mouth that they
may not be meat for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord God, even I will both ſearch my ſheep,
and ſeek them out: As a ſhepherd ſeeketh out his flock in the day
that he is among his ſheep that are ſcattered, ſo will I ſeek out my
ſheep, and I will deliver them out of all places where they have
been ſcattered in the cloudy and dark day, and I will bring them
out from the people, and gather them from the Countreys, and I
will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We are hereby to obſerve God's Commandments to

3. The woe that is pronounced againſt thoſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds

            <p>4. The Lord will in his due time take us into his fold, &amp;
under his own immediate care, and feed his own flock, he
will deliver us from the mouth of thoſe ſhepherds that fed
upon them, that they may not be meat for them anymore.</p>
            <p>All which doth adminiſter matter of great comfort and
conſolation to us all, eſpecially thoſe that fear the Lord,
who in his own time, which is the beſt time, will relieve
the oppreſſed and feed us with the bread of life, we ought

               <hi>For though I preach the Goſpel, I have nothing to glory of:
For neceſſity is laid upon me,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. ch</note> yea, wo is to me if I preach not the
Goſpel; for if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my will, a diſpenſation of the Goſpel is committed unto
me. What is my reward then, verily that when I preach the
Goſpel of Chriſt without charge, that I abuſe not my power in the
Goſpel. For though I be free from all men, yet have I made my
ſelf a ſervant unto all that I may gain the more: and this I
do for the Goſpel ſake, that I may be partaker of the Goſpel with

2. The youth of this Pariſh which are like to the young
Lambs are left to go aſtray, being not Catechiſed nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
either in their duty towards God or man: but left

Religion now grown rich be aſhamed of that which firſt
gave it credit and ſet it up, leſt the Jeſuits and Seminaries
beat us at our own weapons, as they have already done,
through the want of this Catechiſing, many which are
well skilled in ſome dark out-corners, have loſt themſelves
in the beaten road thereof. And it is obſerved, that ſince
this bad man hath undertaken the charge of the Souls of
this great Pariſh, that great numbers of his flock are gone
aſtray for want of a faithful worthy Paſtor to inſtruct and
guide them in their own native Language.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour uſeth theſe words,<note place="margin">John 10. ch v. 11.</note> 
               <hi>I am the good ſhepherd,
the good ſhepherd giveth his life for his ſheep: But he that is an
<hi>Hireling,</hi> and not the ſhepherd, whoſe own the ſheep are not,
ſeeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the ſheep and fleeth, and the
wolf catcheth them and ſcattereth the ſheep, the hireling fleeth,
becauſe he is an hireling and careth not for the ſheep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. This Text is a clear and plain definition of a true
ſhepherd and an hireling.<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſ. </seg>6</label>
            </p>
            <p>2. It doth ſufficiently prove the ſhepherd of this place
to be no true ſhepherd but an hireling, and that the ſheep
are not his own.</p>
            <p>3. For as long as he did quietly feed upon them, and
receive the tenth part of their labour and ſubſtance, he
continued amongſt them.</p>
            <p>4. But when the dark and cloudy day came, wherein
he was to give a teſtimony of his faith and calling, when
his uſurped living was once in danger to be ſequeſtred, he
fled away like a coward to the place from whence he came
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42686:5"/>
and left his ſheep to the mercie of the Wolves, and his

ſhepherd that will love and feed his flock, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the Church again the loſt ſheep that are gone
aſtray.</p>
            <p>5. This hireling would not endure one hours impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
nor ſo much as one combat for the Religion he
profeſſed, or the Religious care he ſhould have had of his
flock; but like a falſe Prophet deſerted thoſe by whom
he was maintained.</p>
            <p>Much like <hi>Peter de Armiens</hi> the Hermit, a great Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary
of the Holy War againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and pretended
he was ſent by command of our Saviour, yet at the ſiege
of <hi>Antioch</hi> moſt cowardly ran away, and was afterwards
moſt ſhamefully brought back again for a fugitive.</p>
            <p>Our Shepherd in deſerting his Pariſhioners in the time
of danger did not follow the Example of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>

               <p>It is more honorable for a Miniſter to conquer the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

It is a great ſhame to intrude wickedly into a Benefice, and
to undermine and thruſt out your Brother to make room
for your own profit and advantage. Saints were wont to
gain honor and profit by flying from them;<note place="margin">Ecclus. 9. 8. v.</note> but you run
over the head of your Brother to overtake them; your
white linnen ſhould put you in mind of the purity of your
Angelical Life, and innocent converſation, whereunto
you ſay you are called.</p>

               <p>A Miniſter abiding within the limits of his purity would
appear amongſt men, as if he came from a Quire of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
As ſoon as he falls off into a diſordinate life and

ought to carry the torch of Example in his own life and

               <p>You know the old ſaying, <hi>Like Prieſt like people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have ill ſpent your time and talent amongſt your
Pariſhioners, if in the end you ſhall deliver them up to
Satan as Reprobates. You are choſen to be the Ark of the

And will ſoon perceive and judge you are in the

the ſtate of Reprobation; for which you may melt into a
cloud of darkneſs at noon-day, to cover your face from
the ſhame and ignominy that you have thereby ſubjected
your ſelf unto. And you your ſelf cannot but ſay it is

               <p>And knowing his own guilt would fain draw down his
Pariſhioners with him to bear him company with infernals

               <p>But let him go, and ſtay there if he will; ſurely his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners
