            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE have made ſo many Declarations of Our Royall Intentions concerning the preſerving of the Religion and Lawes of this Land, That Wee think it not fit often to repeat, Though by Gods grace We ſeriouſly intend never to decline or depart from the ſame. But this ſeems moſt ſtrange unto Us, that whil'ſt (eſpecially at, and about <hi>London</hi>) Our juſt and legall Commands are not obeyed, other Orders and Ordinances, (for which there is no legall foundation) which not only diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, but overthrow the Lawes of the Land that ſettle Religion, and were the ſences of the Subjects property, are ſubmitted unto and obeyed by many of Our weaker Subjects: And amongſt theſe a blind obedience hath been yeelded unto the pretended Ordinance, for ſetling the Receipt of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> and other impoſitions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes, without an Act of Parliament, when an Act this Parliament (received from Us, and ſo underſtood by Us, as one of the greateſt graces the Crowne ever conferred on the Subject) declares, no ſuch Paiments are due without an Act; and by that Act it is provided, that all ſuch Perſons as receive the ſame incurr the forfeiture of a Premunire. This We thought would not have found obedience from the Merchant, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what his owne benefit was thereby, and could not be ignorant how penall it was in him to breake this Law; eſpecially when he found he was to pay thoſe duties for ſupport of an unnaturall Warr againſt his Prince, and to foment an inteſtine and Civill diſſention which hath already, and may in the future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo many Evills upon this poore People, contrary to the true intention of the ſaid Act. But upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces and uſage ſome received that denyed it, We find ſince a more generall Obedience in ſuch as Trade, then We expected, though We underſtand by it the Trade of the Kingdom is much leſſened. Nevertheleſſe We thought not fit untill this preſent, by any of Our Proclamations to prohibite the ſame, becauſe We hoped before this time, We having ſo often and by ſo many meanes endeavoured the ſame, ſome happy underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding might have been between Us and both Our Houſes of Parliament. But at preſent finding that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes ariſing from theſe Duties, are a great part of the fewell that maintaines this fire, and ſupports this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Rebellion againſt Us, and heightens the Spirits of ſuch as have no Spirit to Peace, unleſſe they may deſtroy Us, Our Poſterity, and the ſetled Government both of Church and State; We doe hereby Declare and Proclaime to all Our People of what ſort ſoever, That whoſoever hence forward ſhall, by vertue of the ſaid pretended Ordinance of Parliament, pay any Monyes under the names of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> or other impoſitions upon Merchandiſe, other then for Cuſtomes to be paid to Our proper Miniſters, which are due to Us by the known Lawes of the Kingdome, That We will proceed againſt him or them in due time, as an ill-affected perſon or perſons to the Peace of this Kingdome, and as ſuch as endeavour (as much as in them lyes) to hinder a true Intelligence betwixt Us and Our People. And for ſuch perſon, or perſons as ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to require or receive the ſame, contrary to the Statute made this Parliament, We ſhall like wiſe proceed againſt them according to the penalty in the ſaid Act. And becauſe (though the Law ought to have been every mans prohibition) We did not, untill this time, forbid the ſame, We doe hereby grant Our free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to all ſuch as formerly having either paid, or received theſe Cuſtomes, ſhall henceforth refuſe the ſame, And to no other.</p>
