         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ George Baker to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, although I haue giuen the onset to publish in our owne naturall tongue, this most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent worke of Distillation, for which cause, it should not be the lesse estéemed, although some more curious than wyse, estéeme of nothing but that which is most rare, or in harde and vnknowne languages. Certainly these kynde of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot abyde that good and laudable Artes shoulde be common to many, fearing that their name and practise should decay, or at the least shoulde diminishe. The intension truely of such persons séemeth much like them which gape for all, and woulde all haue, leauing nothing to anye body, but that which they must néedes forgo, not considering that we are not borne for our selues onely, as <hi>Plato</hi> sayth, but for the profite of our countrie. Surely, if that I did not feare to be to long in this Preface, I would prooue howe all Artes and sciences may be published in that tongue which is best vnderstanded: as for example, <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Paulus Aegineta, Aecius,</hi> were Grecians, and wrote all in the Gréeke, to the perfect vnderstanding of their countrie men. Also <hi>Cornelius Celsus</hi> being a Latinist, wrote in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. <hi>Auicen</hi> and <hi>Albucrasis,</hi> Arabians, wrote in the Arabicke tongue. The eternall fame of which worthye men shall neuer be extinguished or drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in obliuion, nor their noble works for euer be out of remembrance. For what man is as yet aliue that euer was able to counteruayle them, yea the best learned in our dayes, doe most hyest estéeme of them aboue all, without whose, workes all Phisitions in the worlde be but blynde, and not able to make any perfite Arte. Peraduenture some will obiect and saye, that if we were without their works, there are other of later wryters which shoulde suffice. To the which I will aunswere, that they haue written nothing, but that their grounde was first layde by them, &amp; further, as M. <hi>Iohn Canape</hi> D. of Phisicke sayth, I wyll giue them this gyft, except they first reade <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> they shall neuer vnderstande what they reade, nor make any perfect worke. Therefore not without good cause <hi>Guido</hi> calleth <hi>Galen</hi> the lanterne of light. And nowe in these our dayes, we sée howe other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doe followe their examples. For what kinde of science or knowledge euer was inuented by man, which is not nowe in the Italian or French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And what more prerogatiue haue they than we English men (of the which many learned men haue made sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t proofe within th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se few yeres, fully to furnish &amp; satisfie our Nation with many goodly works.) For our English is as méete &amp; necessary for vs, as is the Greeke for the Grecians, though in the translation we be constrayned to make two or three words sometyme for one. For if it were not permitted to translate but word for word, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I say, away with all translations, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which were great losse to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that out of one language into another haue ben turned many most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent works, the which the best learned haue both receyued &amp; approoued to the
<pb facs="tcp:3208:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
singular commoditie of all men. And among all the workes which haue bene translated into our natiue tongue, I doe thinke concerning the matter, there was neuer the lyke to this as yet. For herein you shall learne the manner to separate by Arte the pure and true substance as well manifest as hidden, the which in Phisicke is a great helpe to the taking away of diseases, harde or rebellious to be cured. And moreouer, that by the Chimicall Arte, those medicines which are harde and hidden, their forces and vertues are plainly manifested and prooued, and the grosse iuyce being mingled with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till and fine substance, are thereby digested and separated, as we may sée by the drawing of the oyle of Golde, Iron, Copper, or Tynne. Also by Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation are corrected the malignitie or venimous qualities therof, as in oyles of Quicksiluer, of oyle of Vitrioll, Antemonie, artificiall Saltes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other purging medicines. Furthermore, we sée plainely before our eyes, that the vertues of medicines by Chimicall distillation, are made more vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, better, and of more efficacie than those medicines which are in vse, and accustomed. In tryall of the which, we doe daily prooue to our great credite, and our pacients comfort. For make tryall betwéene the one and the other, and you shall sée that the decoctions, Iuices, Syrupes, or such lyke, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come neare to the dystilled waters, Oyles, Balmes, artificiall Salts, and extraction of Rootes, leaues, flowers, and fruites, of woode, Barkes, Gummes, Mettals, and such others, so that two or thrée drops of the oyle of Sage doth more profite in the Palsie: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for the falling sickenesse: Thrée drops of the Quintessences of Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rle for the Sincope or swounding: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Brimstone or Turpentine for the Astmatikes: One droppe of the oyle of Cloues, for the colde payne in the téeth: Thrée droppes of the oyle Ammoniacke for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of the splene: One dramme of the water of the oyle or salt of Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, for the French poxe. One dram of the oyle of Walwort for the goute: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Iron for the Dysenteria, or other whyte fluxes: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Crystall for the stone: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Cloues or Baye berries for the Cholicke: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Antimonium for the Leprosie, doth more than one pound of those decoctions not dystilled. And another thing is to be noted, that the diseased people, principally those which are delicate, doe detest all things which doe not agree to their myndes, and delight not onely in the pleasantnesse of the taste, but also the sight of the eye, and the littlenesse of the quantitie of the medicine, the which I thinke, no man will denie. But this I will say, that thorowe the fire there is some hote qualitie in the medicine, but that qualitie is easie to be corrected, as in the administring of them are plainlye taught. Peraduenture some in the sight of the furnaces, and other vessels wyll bee lothe to meddle with so busie matters, as the preparing of the Mettalles, and drawing of Quintessences.

faithfully deale, among whome none to be dispraysed. I doe know some most excellent, as one mayster Kemech an Englishe man dwelling in Lothburie, another, mayster Geffray, a French man dwelling in the Crouched friers, men of singular knowledge that waye, another named Iohn Hester dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on Powles wharfe, the which is a paynfull traueyler in those matters, as I by proofe haue séene, and vsed of their medicines to the furtheraunce of my Pacients healthes, and also one Thomas Hyll, who for his excellent knowledge in this Arte, is not to be left out, who dyd also take paynes in this worke, but before it coulde be brought to perfection, God tooke him to his mercie: There are yet others excellent men, which for breuitie I leaue at thys present. so finishing this my simple Preface, desiring God to further the studie of all those which faithfully and truely meane in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyse of this so noble an Arte, desiring all those which shall finde any fault, that they will friendlye admonishe me thereof, or else to note them in the margent of their owne bookes for their priuate vse and commoditie, till such time as it shall be new printed agayne, and then if it shall please them to giue me their olde Bookes so corrected, I will deliuer them newe for them. And as for those finde faultes, which will doe nothing themselues, I wey them not, for I had rather be seruiceable to my Countrie, than to please some particular persons, as the Lorde doth knowe, who ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and guydes vs all in the right way. Amen. From my house in Bartholmewe lane beside the Royall exchaunge in London, this xxj. day of Februarye. <hi>1576.</hi>

Or thus, let your Bodie be set into the Sande, that thrée partes appeare frée and aboue the Sande, and the heade to haue a long necked Receyuer, aptly luted or fastened to the Nose, that
<figure/>
the same retching a good distance from the heate of the fire, may thereby yéelde and sende forth the more plentie of moysture, drawne by force of heate of the fire, which raysed of the same into a vapour extenuated, and this agayne thickned through the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Ayre compassing the heade, is on such wise conuerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lycour, which from thence by droppes falling into the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell or Gutter of the heade, doth so distill and runne forth by the Nose into a long necked Receyuer standing vnder, and this we properly name a Distillation: Or thus, Distillation (as writeth the former <hi>Fumanellus</hi> in his Booke of the Composition of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines) is the drawing or running forth of a thynner and purer humour by little and little, or droppe by droppe, by force of the heate, out of the iuice or thicke substance contained in the Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, or other vessell, for the onelye purpose: through which, as by a certaine Boyling, is a separation and ascention, caused of many matters mixed togither, and the drawing forth sometimes of certaine secrete matters and hidde properties, into one speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all substance gathered and thickened into a water or other thinne

licour, properly in the heade, which, after distilling downe into the Receyuer, serueth for the commoditie and vse of sundrie griefes and sickenesses. Not vnlyke wryteth <hi>Iohannes Mesue,</hi> where he affirmeth that many matters of sundrie kyndes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned, and as they were congealed into one bodie, in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbite or Glasse bodie, are by force of the heate separated, in working, according to the industrie of the Chymistes, and Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Quintessence. And for troth such Ascentions, Distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Sublimations of Bodies, are not wholy a water, nor tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly an oylie or vnctuous licour, but a certaine substance suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently differing from the same matter, which tofore you had put and mixed togither, to be distilled. In this place it is not to be forgotten, nor ouerpassed, that this worde to Sublyme, may be vsed in an other signification with the Chymistes: as when they mention of Mercurie sublymed. &amp;c. The signification of which, shall after at large be taught. And although y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in euery Distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, many &amp; diuers considerations are necessary to be learned, yet ought these two things to be specially regarded at all tymes of euery workman (which foreséene at the beginning of the work, that the industrious Artificer be diligent to compasse and bryng to an ende the same) the one is the matter which he myndeth to deale withall, as to finde and trie out of what condition the same is, and whether of hys owne nature it is proper to indure, or doe: The other is to such ende, that the worke which is pretended, may come to a good and happy successe: and then is required to choose and make readie, séemely and apt vessels. If the Dystiller will carefully consider and haue regarde vnto these two poyntes (as méete and right it is) then néedeth he not to doubt, but that he shall bring his worke vnto the same perfection and desired ende, which he hopeth after: For as in the vniuersall or generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thinges in this worlde, all Bodies are not made and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med indifferently of euery sort and condition of matter, nor the Craftesman can indifferently cut out &amp; carue the ymage of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie, of euery woode (as by many &amp; singular reasons the learned Phisitions do perswade and prooue to vs) but all things are made &amp; formed of a certayne matter, apt and proportioned to receyue a forme appointed, by the meanes &amp; aide of many causes; euen so in

Wherefore séeing that all mixt Bodies, be constituted and formed of the foure Elements: and that among those, the one more partaketh of the Ayre, the other more of the water, some more of the fire; others more of the earth, according to the necessitie of ech compounde predominant and gouerning: for which cause it behooueth to regard, and diligently to consider in eche Bodie, what Element surmounteth the other: These well considered, it shall be an easie matter by force of the fire, to separate and drawe a water out of those substances, which are of nature waterie: as also with lyke easinesse it is possible to drawe an Oyle, by the Arte of Distillation, out of others that be of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie Aeriall or fierie: For the heate of the fire is such, that it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth togither those things which are of like kinde and nature, &amp; separateth such as be disagréeing. There be also many Bodies or substances that be earthly and drie, out of which, to draw a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Oyle, is not onely harde to be done, but is altogither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible: yet are there some Bodies or substances, out of which, a water doth easilye distill, as all such matters which shall be moyste and waterie: Others there are, out of which, an Oyle may be drawne, but no water at all, as all those substaunces or Bodies, which be very tough and harde through drynesse.</p>

good occasion, the first inuentors of the Arte of Distilling, and their successors, which made a matter of the sayde Arte, deuised diuers kyndes of Distilling, according to the diuersitie of things proper to be distilled, by the meanes of which, they might the more easily come vnto the intended scope which they purposed. Agayne, séeing it is certaine, that for the diuersitie of the kyndes and fashions of Distilling, there néedeth diuers instrumentes proper and commodious to eche fashion of Distilling. Good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is (in my opinion) that we intreate of the kyndes of Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, before we make mention of the Instruments.</p>
               <p>Séeing that euery Distillation is done by the resolution and separation of the substantiall partes, through the force of the outwarde heate: The Chymicke Authours haue purposed two wayes, and the rule certayne of the sayde separation. For they vnderstoode and knewe by reason and experience, that some Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or substances, with greater payne doe yéelde or sende forth a lycour: and others more easilye, and with lesser traueyle. For which cause they inuented one maner verye easie, and another harder, and with greater payne, according to the necessitie and condicion of the matter or substaunce to be drawne. The one of
<figure/>
these they woulde to be done in the Discending, which the Latine
<pb facs="tcp:3208:19"/>
Chymistes terme, <hi>per Descensum:</hi> the other in the Ascending, of the Latynes named <hi>per Ascensum</hi>: so that for eche of these, they gaue the same apte names. By this reason we saye in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that euery Distillation to be done in the Descending, or in the Ascending, so that eyther of these two wayes are to be applied i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>differently to these things that a man woulde distill: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as eche person may herein be perswaded, after the capacitie of his wytte, or by experience. But the oftner Distillation that is exercysed in the Ascending, is done of the séedes of Herbes, which spread into bredth, bearing flowers &amp; séedes, as the Annise, the Dill, the Fennel, &amp; such others. In like maner of the fragrant and comfortable spices, the Teares, Gummes, Rosins, &amp; lycors. For those which are done in the Descending, or by Discention, are the oyles drawen out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woodes of Iuniper trée, Aloe, Guai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, Ashe, Tamaricke, Medler trée, Pyne trée. &amp;c. although true it is, that sundrie waters are distilled into the Descending, or by Discention, as those of Roses, Flowers, and tender Herbes. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Further, although that the Chymisticke Authors doe teache and shewe diuers fashions of Distilling by Ascention, yet maye all these ways &amp; fashions be brought into thrée orders, according to the difference of the cause agent or efficient, which is heate.</p>
               <p>The first maner is, when we distill any liquide substance or flowers in the Sunne by force of his heate. The seconde, when the Distillation is done, by force of the heate of fire. The thirde is perfourmed by the
<figure/>
heate, which consisteth in putrified and rotten matters or substaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlye, and by order, we shall after intreat.</p>
               <p>First, the Distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is done in the Sunne, when the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell or Lymbecke of Glasse filled with the matter, which a man woulde distill, is set fully in the hote Sunne
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3208:19"/>
on fine sifted Sande or Ashes hote, to the nose of which, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuer hanging or fastened: But this maner of Distillyng in Englande and Germanie, and in colde Countries, cannot so well be perfourmed. Yet sundrie Chymistes are woont to prepare manye Oyles by Sunning, that is, by setting them in the hote Sunne, which perhaps maye more commodiouser be prepared and done by decoction, to the ende that the facultie and propertie of the Symples maye the better be drawne forth by a stronger heate.</p>
               <p>Secondlye, there be manye maners and wayes of drawing forth waters and Oyles of compounde thinges, by the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie &amp; force of the heate of fire. For eyther the thinges to be distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, are put vp or closed simply in a Cucurbite or Retort (which are instruments of Glasse for distilling, beyng large at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome) and set ouer the heate of fire: or the same substance closed

vppe in a Cucurbite or Glasse bodie, set into that Furnace na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> or else bestowed in sifted Ashes, or fine Sande, a desired Lycour is drawne forth, by force of the drye heate of fire put vnder. This maner of Distilling, as it is verye excellent, and euery where vsed: euen so is the same moste at large set forth, as in the instructions following, shall further be
<pb facs="tcp:3208:20"/>
learned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the forme of Distilling by Ascention, is done in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillatorie vessels, filled with the purposed medicines or substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, déepe set, or standing couered, in a heape or little hyll of newe pressed Grapes with the Kirnelles, or in the refuse of Olyues, after the Oyle pressed forth, or in Horse, or other Cattels dung. For by the rotten heate of any of these kyndes, being one and the selfesame continuall for certayne dayes. The Chymistes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye purge and separate their Quintessences, by a small labour and cost, but infuse in a Glasse bodie (with a narrowe necke and mouth, for a long tyme) their singular Medicines and Balmes, with Oyle, <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or other Lycoure, with which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to cure diuers desperate diseases and sickenesses. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so affirme by the sayde forme of Distilling, that certaine waters maye be attayned for the restoring of youth, and prolonging of lyfe, and I cannot tell what maner of Defensatiues, and worthy Drinckes (sayth <hi>Ioannes Langius</hi> in his Epistles) for expelling of the Plague, and all maner of poysons, to which as they gaue the name of Golde, or termed Golden: euen so they woulde those to be rewarded with gyftes of Golde. And these thrée manners of Distilling, may by good right be named Sublimations, bicause these make their vapors to ascende on high.</p>

               <p>The other forme and maner of Distilling, which the Chymistes often haue in vsage, named of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> by Discention, is wrought or done on this wyse, a round hole and déepe, must be dygged in the earth, after two Potts prepared, glased within for the onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the vpper Pot, hauing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye small hoales in the bottome, and that filled wyth the matter or chyppes of the woode to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled, which after sette into the mouth of the nether Potte, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the grounde, luting dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently

               <p>EVery Distillation is especially perfourmed and done by two wayes or meanes: as the first by heate and Drynesse, and
<pb facs="tcp:3208:22"/>
the other by heate and moysture. And of both these, there are thrée degrées constituted: the first is of gentle heate, or of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie weake: the seconde more strong, yet with some mediocritie: the thirde heate is mightie and violent. Therefore it behooueth to gouerne the fire, and to moderate the same, according to the nature and qualitie that the skilfull may haue, of the thing or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which he would distill: Herein not neglecting how much &amp; howe little the seconde and thirde qualities are to be moderated. Wherefore those, which are of a tender and thynne substaunce, as the Lettuce, Endyue, Sorrell, Maydenheare, Harts tongue, and such lyke Symples, doe not endure a heate but moderate, and which is of the first degrée: those which are thick and grosse, and of a substance more firme and solide, as the Wormewoode, Mugwoort, Egrimonie, Sothernwoode, the Aromaticke things, the Spyces, and others lyke, require a heate more mightie. The Antimonie contrarywyse, and all kyndes of Mettals, desire one maner of fire. By the heate moderate, in the Distillation of Wyne, and all Herbes, doe the watrie partes ascende: but by the heate more mightie and violent, doe the thynner partes onely shewe, and the watrie tarie behynde. Further conceyue, that the flame it selfe as well as the Coales, doe not a little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, not by reason only of the same being greater or lesser, but by occasion of the woodes rottennesse, or yll smelling, or otherwyse sounde and well smelling, gréene or dry. To these, the greatnesse or smalnesse of the Furnace: the forme and closing of it, hath a great force in chaunging or altering of the heate. The Coales al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so made of smothered and halfe burnt woode, yéelde a certaine yll <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>auour and straunge qualitie in the thynges distilled: as the lyke in boyling, and otherwyse preparing of matters with them is perceyued. For which cause the Coales ought to be thorow kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, and halfe burnt, whereby the malignitie or yll sauour of them, maye (in the dooing) breath forth, before that anye matter be distilled with them, to be ministred especially into the Bodye, were the same outwarde applyed, it forceth not so much. There is as great a matter to be considered in the difference of Coales: for that the Coales made of the woode growing in the valleyes are supposed to be woorthyer and farre better, than those made of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3208:22"/>
the woode on the Hlles: and the woode in the valleys is the thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for which cause are the Coales the lyke, yet doth the fire lyghtly and soone waste all thynne matters. And in makyng the
<figure/>
best Coales, they ought not to be done vnder the Grounde (as the custome of many is) but made aboue the Earth, for that they burne better, and are more profitable. Also the Coales made of the Béeche, Birche, and Fyrre trée, are accounted best, for their swéeter and sooner burning, although Coles of the Iuniper trée, doe last farre longer, as of experience knowne: besides, the Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les made of the Oke and Ashe trée, are not in cases of necessitie to be refused, especially where the store of the Béeche, and other trées are not. Moreouer, it behooueth the Distillatour to haue a speciall regarde and care about the bestowing of fire vnder hys vessels, that the same be not made of cleft woode halfe rotten, or euill smelling (as we haue aboue declared) nor of Coales smoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered within a déepe pit or hole of the Earth, or euill burned, or of Coales gotten out of Caues, whether those be of Stone, or of Earth, for feare that the vessels of Distilling, and the lycours be not taynted and infected of their vapour, filthie and stynking. A lyke reason may be gathered, that if waters or Oyles be distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with any of those, they after purchase a sauour and qualitie

disagréeing, yea, farre vnlyke the substances that are to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylled, as the same maye well be perceyued and tasted, by the matter boyled with any of them. Further, the Chambers, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Stoues, Hote houses, heated wyth such woode or Coales, doe sufficiently witnesse howe noyous and hurtfull such a vapour and sauour is, which not onely bryngeth an intollerable payne of the heade, but mooueth vomiting, and causeth passions of the heart, to those which be conuersant and abyde any tyme in such places: as I the lyke (sayeth the worthie <hi>Gesnerus</hi>) haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in my selfe, to the perill of my health, at the Bathes of <hi>Oenosponte,</hi> where I abode a certayne season with the Noble Prince Palatine.

In such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Distillation is not wholye wrought or done in the Bathe named <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> nor yet onely in Sande. There are some which wylleth a quantitie of sande to be myxed with the water of <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> to the intent the heate may be the greater, and more vehement: for in such a maner of Distillation, maye twoo waters be obtayned, as the first thynne and waterie, the other more redde and thycker, as the learned <hi>Mathiolus</hi> reporteth. To these it behooueth to note, that the Distillation which is done with the fine syfted powder of Bryckes or Tylestones, is the better and more sure of all others, according to the iudgement of some skylfull persons, for that it nourisheth and mayntayneth equally the heate, and breaketh not so lightly and soone the Glasse bodies: which two thyngs are verye necessarie in Distillations: But of
<pb facs="tcp:3208:24"/>
all these varieties, we mynde at large to intreate in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Distillations, and to shewe in what, and when it is néedefull to vse nowe the one, and nowe the other meanes.</p>

               <p>The infusions by whyche the dryer matters are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to distill, for the more easie drawing forth the Water or Oyle: are done ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in simple wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter labored, that is, running by pypes a long way: or in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dystilled, or in water of Lyfe, or Wyne, or in water distilled of Herbes simply, or vinegar, or in any other lycour: on such wyse infused, let them stande and abyde in the hote Sunne, or on the fire, for the space of halfe an houre, or more houres, a whole night, a whole daye, twoo dayes, thrée dayes, one, or many Monethes, accordyng to the nature of the medicine, and diuers intention of the Phisition, and necessitie present. We wring out sometymes before the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation the thyngs infused, and distill the lycour wrynged forth, or the same we distill in a Glasse body, or other like Instrument, the infusion altogither, that is, the same which is infused, and the lycour in which the infusion is made.</p>
               <p>The waters and Oyles which are drawne forth of pleasaunt Spyces, ought to be done by infusion in simple water, not in Wyne, nor in <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> for that these doe ouer spéedily ascende, and carie not with them the force and vertue of the Aromaticke
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3208:24"/>
Spyces: but the simple water, (in a contrary maner) ascendeth not, without carying with it the Aromaticke vertue. Sometimes we put to putrifie the thyngs to be Distilled, and after that they
<figure/>
are putrified, we distill them: although that sometimes the same putrifaction is a kynde of Distillation, as we haue afore vttered, and shall after intreate more at large in the proper place.</p>
               <p>The Fermentation of matters, is done after the maner of infusions, by an outwarde heate increased, which worketh into moysture, whereby a certayne common qualitie with the hote spirite causing bubbles, may be myxed and extended thorowout the whole bodye: and this eyther wrought in the Sunnes great heate at the Dogge dayes (if the Sunnes heate in the meane tyme, be not sufficient) or on the Furnace of <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gouerned, or in hote Horse dung.

For how much the thicker the compasse about, or walles shall be, so much the more heate they retayne wythin. The vnbaked Bryckes ought first to be layde in a moyst place, as in a Celler, to the ende that those maye more easily be cut and fashioned, with the edge of the Trowell, or some other apt Instrument of yron. The Bryckes ought so to be couched and layde one vpon another, that the ioynts (in the lying of them) méete not, but are vnequall, as the ende of one reaching to the myddle of another: for by the same maner couched, the buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and walles shall be the stronger.

The Cucurbite and heade may wholy be made of Tynne, which are more commodious, in that the Glasse bodye is lightly broken through heate, and to much colde. In

And this Copper Panne ought so to be set into the Furnace, that it hangeth well a spanne distant from the Grate vnderneath.</p>
               <p>The Tower of the Philosophers, is a Furnace that hardlye can be learned by wordes, nor by long wryting, wythout full sight of the same in the buylding: for if any happeneth to sée the whole making of it, yet maye he fayle to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ceyue and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the secret consisting in it, in that there are many thynges
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3208:27"/>
in it, framed and made after such maner, that a man may hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attayne to the knowledge of them. But to declare wholy (and to thende) howe the same is to be made, and that anye conceyueth this my wryting and demonstration, to his profite be it, and he that vnderstandeth not the same, to his harme be it. The maner of erecting and framing of the sayd Tower, is on this wyse, that the foundation be laide foure square with rawe or baked Bricks, on a playne and euen grounde, and thrée foote broade on euerye side, and that a hollowe space (in crosse maner) be left, to the bredth of a baked Bricke, and of heygth so much, as is the heygth of the sayde Bricke in largenesse set on edge: and this Pype or Gutter, is the same, where the fire or flame passeth, and ouer the myddes of the sayde crosse Pype, lay an iron Grate, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the same buylde a rounde Furnace of a spanne in breadth, and a yarde and a halfe of heygth: and this is named the Tower, and to the fower holes (appearing forth) buylde and frame in like maner fower little Furnaces rounde, but lower than the hoales, and without little Grates of iron in them: that the fire or flame may passe by those pipes, &amp; enter within the sayd small furnaces, on which, may be placed or set Glasse bodies, Retortes, or other vessels. When you will bestowe Coales, and make fire in the myddle Tower, doe the same after this maner, that is, take kindled coales, and put them in at the bottome of the Tower, and after fill vp the sayd Tower with dead or vnkindled coales: and shut close aboue with a couer of Iron, the head of the tower, that no ayre breath forth: for by this dooyng, the fire shall burne only belowe, so much as the pypes which extende to the Furnaces can receyue, and no more: and on such wyse, in a Tower of this greatnesse full of Coales, will the fire indure twelue or fourtéene houres, without putting in of any Coale. With this Tower may a man Distill, Circulate, drye vp, and Sublyme, with great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie: And this is the Philosophers Tower aboue named, which serueth, and is very necessarie in the Arte of Alchymie.</p>
               <p>Another skilfull Chymist, teacheth a very ingenious maner of Distilling, by which a man may with one onely fire drawe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, and all at one tyme, both Water and Oyle, besides the commoditie of Sublyming, and Distilling by <hi>Balneo Mariae:</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:3208:28"/>
this is named a Distillation in the tower, by reason of the forme of the Furnace, or rather named the Philosophers Tower, for great commodities of the same, which is made after this maner: that is, in any playne and euen grounde, let the forme of a tower be buylt, eyther rounde or square, or fixe cornered, or of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forme, with vnbaked or baked Bryckes, and in heygth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a yarde and a halfe, or twoo or three, or so hygh and large as a man pleaseth, in such condicion alwayes, that the same maye receyue and contayne a fire sufficient great and burning: In the sayde Tower, distant from the ground, about a handbredth and a halfe, let be layde a Grate of iron, which maye beare vppe the Coales, with a wyndowe or square hole, by which the ayre may enter to kyndle the Coales. After that done, let be buylt of eyther side, and round about the tower, many Furnaces regarding the outwarde face of the tower, of such a bygnesse as he thinketh good and necessarie, and of such heygth from the ground, as answereth aptly to the Grate of iron, which shall be in the myddes of the tower, and on eche side of the tower, which shall be in the myddes of these Furnaces, let holes be made sufficient great, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher than the Grate of iron, to the ende, that by those the heate of the fire might be communicated and extended to the Furnaces. These Furnaces ought to be buylt after the forme of the Bulwarkes of a warrelike Towne: to eche of the holes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and extending within the Tower, before that the Furnaces are set or ioyned too, ought a Plate or Register of Iron to be made, boared with thrée, or sixe holes, or more, and those of lyke greatnesse and distance, one directly aboue the other: to the ende, that those maye be drawne wholye forth of the Furnace, when néede shall require the same, or thrust downe so déepe, as the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist woulde that the force of the fire to extende to the Furnaces without, whether the same be by two or thrée, or one onely hole, or by the great or least hole: At the toppe of the myddle Tower, ought there to be made lyke to a vaulte, by which the Furnace or the tower may be exactly closed, to the ende that the ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the hole or doore belowe shall he put in the fire, for by that meanes the Coales which shall be nearer the sayde holes, wyll be consumed by the fire, and on such wyse consumed, that those which shall be at the toppe of the Tower, shrynking and falling downe by little and little, kyndle and burne one after the other, and in the lyke maner doe the others consequently burne, vntill all shall be kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled and wasted. The person which will occupie such a fashion, and the lyke Furnaces to distill in, it shall suffice that he visite or looke to his fire once in the daye. Such a buylding is not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and delectable to beholde, but also very commodious and necessarie. I haue séene sometymes (sayth the Chymist) that a <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> hath bene placed on the sayde buylding, or toppe of the Tower, and a vessell to Sublyme: besides a Furnace for Reuerberating, and Cymenting, and a Furnace for Melting, according as a man may learne &amp; know, by the figure herevnder descrybed. Another Furnace I sawe of meaner cost in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<figure/>
which had a Tower in the myddes, lyke to this abouesayd,
<pb facs="tcp:3208:29"/>
being foure square, and very playne of workemanship, at whose corners were foure vessels placed, as at eche corner one, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters made for them, as to the other Furnaces afore descry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: so that little differing in vses, sauing in the forme and bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for which cause, this Furnace is to be ordered in all poynts lyke to the aforesayde: in gouerning the Registers, and heate of the fire, that this may easier be conceyued, I haue ioyned it with the figure before descrybed, as the same maye euidentlye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péere on the other side to the eye, borowed both out of the singular worke, intituled <hi>Pirotechnia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sayde Chymist in his worke of <hi>Pirotechnia,</hi> descrybeth two other Furnaces, seruing to sundrie vses: the one to be built after this maner: That is, a square Turret to be raysed wyth Bryckes, and the same made rounde wythin, the hole for the drawing forth of the Ashes, to be halfe a foote from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aboue which (nygh a foote) thrée or foure small Barres to be layde (in the forme of a Grate) well a finger bredth distant one from the other, that the Ashes may the lightlyer fall through, for hyndring of the fire to burne and gyue his heate, on this Grate all about laye Tyles in handsome maner, leauing but a hands bredth vncouered, for the fire to burne through: after this, about a foote higher, make your Ouen open in the toppe, but in fashion lyke to the Bakers Ouen, which leaue hollowe downewarde to the Grate, that the Coles in the nether Ouen (hauing a lesser mouth than the vpper) kyndled, may burne and flame vp: to the mouth of this nether Ouen, must a doore be set, whereby it may be opened for the putting in and taking out of Coales, &amp; shutting the same agayne, when néede shall require: but the mouth of the vpper and greater, must alwayes be left open, for the flame to passe forth: ouer the inner mouth of this greater Ouen, must two Iron barres more be layde, so wyde one from the other, that a man may handsomelye set on them a melting Crucible, or other vessell to calcyne withall, as it behooueth: Ouer the head of this square Turret remayning open, must so large a slate stone be layde, as may wholy couer the same, yet may you not make fast the slate with morter, to the heade or top of the Ouen or Turret, in that when néede requireth, the same is to be taken of. After
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3208:29"/>
all these done, the Ouen must (within and without) be well play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred with fast and strong Lyme, that the same chop not, which perfourmed, the Furnace is then finished. The Crucible with the matter that you woulde calcyne, shall you sette on the Iron Barres, and laye downe the Slate close on the Ouens heade: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kyndle fire in the nether Ouen, that the flame extending vp, and about the Crucible, maye so passe forth of the mouth of the

vpper Ouen, for on such wyse, it calcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the better, in that the flame must burne about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before it extendeth forth of the mouth of the Ouen. The vses of these two Ouens, are for the calcyning of Metalline Bodies, or other Mixtures, which are lyke calcyned, as the Saltes, and all maner of stones. And without the lyke Furnaces, may a man performe no work, where as calcination néedeth: for if hée shall attempt to calc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ne Bodies by another meanes, it wil be very hard to bring to passe: wherfore the Philosophers at the first, inuented such a Furnace, for the lyke intent and purpose, and named it properly the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Reuerberation for calcyning, and cymenting.</p>
               <p>The other Furnace made rounde and hollow to the bottome, differeth but little from the abouesayde, sauing that this in the working, is left open and vncouered at the toppe for the fumes to passe forth: neare to the bottome must a square hole be formed, and a doore to the same, whereby the fire by it maye so be gouerned, that the same maye be increased great or small, as néede shall requyre. Aboue this, a Grate of Iron for the Coles to burne vpon, and vent holes rounde about, for the ayre to come in, aswell as the heade remayning all open for the large passing forth of the smoke: which otherwyse woulde not burne, for the lacke of vent holes to let the smoke passe, that séeketh yssue forth,
<pb facs="tcp:3208:30"/>
so that nothing séemeth, nor is more enimie to the fire, than the smoke. And for this reason, if Furnaces had not their ventes of breathing holes, it were not possible that they coulde worke or doe their effect: and if these in like maner had not their breathing forth belowe, the fire with great difficultie woulde burne: for which cause, it behooueth to haue breathing holes on eyther side, that the Furnace maye worke with more easinesse. The vessell standing on the Grate ought to be well defended with lute round about, before the Coales be poured vppon to kyndle and burne: the doore of the same requireth to be opened reasonable wyde for a tyme, to thende the fire maye kyndle &amp; burne the fréelyer, and the smoke passe forth at the toppe. The Furnace thus finished, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth as well for the

               <p>A commended Furnace for distiling of the Oyle of Vitríoll, and other Oyles, is made after this maner: First, with baked Brickes and Tyles a foundation layde foure square, on which, a wall raysed a foote high, or thereabout, and a doore made belowe for the drawing forth of Ashes: aboue this (wythin the Furnace) a Grate couched of the sayde heygth, distant from the bottome a foote and a halfe, or thereabout. After this, bestowe ouerthwarte the myddle of the same, a long &amp; sufficient stronge Barre of yron, mortered with the best Lute, and that it extendeth from one side vnto another of the Furnace. Betwéene the Grate and the sayd

Barre of Iron, frame of the one side of the Furnace, a slowe Harrie, euen as the figure following demonstrateth: Which ought to be of such a greatnesse, that a man maye in a manner thrust in his heade. The things thus prepared readie, set forward the building of the Furnace of the Barre of Iron, vnto the heygth of a foote and a halfe, and leaue it on such wyse open, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you haue bestowed the Glasse, in which the Vitrioll is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned.

The Furnace thus buylt and prepared in a readynesse, set in the Glasse strongly fenced with Lute, and filled with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared substance, of that side of the Furnace which remayneth open: in such maner place it within, that the bottome staying on the yron Barre, the neck may be caused to bende downwarde, so much as may be, in the ouerthwart standing of it in the furnace: But not so much downward, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substance in the Glasse may spill forth. The necke of the Retorte (if you will drawe the Oyle of Vytrioll) ought to lye or extende forth, nigh halfe a foote, to the ende that it may after be verye well luted and fastened with the Receyuer hanging without. The thinges on such wyse prepared, close vp all that part open of the Furnace, from the Grate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the toppe of it, and conioyne with Morter by the same meanes very diligently, the Glasse with the Furnace. After that (in this closing vp) you are come vnto the top, make a great hole at one of the foure corners, of the greatnesse of an Egge, and a couer formed to it, that the same may be set on and taken away, when néede requireth, at the other thrée corners, make in lyke manner ventes or breathing holes, but those much lesser (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<figure/>
this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, is named a Crooked Body or Retort: and where alwayes mencion is made of a Retort, there is ment a Vessell of suche a forme, whether the same be great or small, according as it shall séeme to the workeman, that it is agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the qualitie, and quantitie of the matter, that he woulde distill with such a kind of Vessell as this is: And in such a kinde of Vessell, the Chymistes distill matters that are vnctuous, which not so aptly sublyme, or ascende on high: as all the kyndes of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that are easily distylled with a Cucurbite and heade, bycause these sublyme with much easinesse: wherefore the things vnctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and heauie, that cannot sublyme or ascende, but with great difficultie, are distilled with this maner of Vessell, in that the same hath but a short and small rysing, before the passing and falling into the Receyuer, and for that cause, this is a Vessell ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
<pb facs="tcp:3208:32"/>
commodious and necessarie in such an Arte, as to ech person may well appeare, by working with the same.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Thys Vessell is named the Glasse body with a long necke, and where at any time is mentioned of a Body (which in Latine is named <hi>Cucurbita</hi>) there this Vessell is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded and ment, whether the same be greater or lesse, according as the workeman shall thynke ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: and this is a Vessell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, muche occupyed of them which Dystill diuers matters in the Arte: and thys is as much v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for Phisicke matters, as for the working of Alchymie: So that this commeth to occupying often, as a thyng most commodious, for the dooyng of all manner of workinges in a maner, and maye as well serue for a Receyuer, as for a Bodie to dystill withall: Of which, it maye be sayde, that thys is a principall Vessell in the Arte of Dystilling, seruing (as it doth) for two Vessels, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng commodious in so many things, so that more néedeth not to be spoken of it. Wherefore we wyll procéede to descrybe herevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Vessell, which (of the Chymistes) is named a Heade, without the which a man can not distill anye matter by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbite or Bodie of Glasse, as after shall playner appeare.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>This Vessell na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Heade, is well knowne to most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and in the Arte of Dystilling verye necessarie: Bycause (as I haue aforesayd) it is impossible, that a man maye distill any thing without it: and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3208:32"/>
of such Vessels, the workeman maye choose or cause to be made wyth narrower and larger mouthes, according to the condicion of the Bodie standing vnder, yet these requyre to be fashioned all after one manner, and the lyke to be made with one manner of Nose: which Nose requyreth to be after thys maner, that is, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned long, and that (put in) it maye reach a good way into the Receyuer, for by entring very déepe in the Dystilling, and the spirites yssuing out of the Bodie, will not be so apt to passe forth of the Receyuer: for thys cause the sayde heade will be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when the Nose shall be formed long: herein considering that it hath the lyke similitude, wyth the Nose of the Heade, here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore descrybed, and being on suche wyse fashioned, it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite Vessell, for the Distilling of tender and Flegmaticke mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>This
<figure/>
Vesselle (the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mystes name) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Vrinall, whyche but little differeth from the Cucurbite (afore described) as to the eie, may euidently be perceyued: for there is no other difference, sauing that the Vri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is formed with a larger necke and mouth, than the Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite hath: and this made the lyke, for that intent, whereby a man myght dystill wyth more facilitie: for by this, the vapors ascende farre better on hygh, through the large head set vpon, lyke to the same afore described. And into thys vessell may the workman put his hande, to drawe out the matter remayning, which resteth at the bottome, without losing of the Vessell: when a man dystilleth not those thyngs, which it behooueth hym to burne, and to rest cleauing to the bottome, so that when the workeman néedeth not to dystill those thyngs, whych requyre a drying vp: in such a case (the contrarie) may he clense the Vrinall, and make it serue for another tyme, yea, for many tymes. In this Vessell may a man
<pb facs="tcp:3208:33"/>
dystill Herbes, Wyne, Flowers, Honie, Waxe, and all other matters, that he thyncketh may aptly be dystilled: for the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may order and apply it, in a manner to all woorkyngs, that he woulde attempt to doe, as well in Alchymie, as in Phisicke matters: so that this Vrinall Bodie, is a Vessell very necessary, as we haue afore declared.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>This Instrument named the Pellicane, which is a Vessell for Circulating, serueth to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ende and purpose, than for to Circulate the Quintessence, which by the Arte of dystilling is drawen: so that thys Vessell on such wyse made, is not apt for the dystilling of any matter, but only serueth for the Circulating of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde lycours. Where in anye place you find written to be done in a Pellicane, the same is ment to be wrought in the sayde Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: and in all the Arte, there is no other kynde of Vessels, that are more necessarie than these fiue, whych we haue afore descry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, although many other Vessels, and of those diuers are occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed of sundrye Chymistes, yet all consist and serue to the lyke woorkyng, which the aboue named doe, that is, the Retorte, the narrowe necked Bodie, the Heade, the Vrinall, and Pellicane, wyth which a man may doe all maner of workes that are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Arte, as Dystillations, Sublimations, Fixations, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and other lyke woorkyngs. And for that cause I thynke it not néedefull to make a long description of so manye straunge sortes, as of those long, short, rounde, square, and so dyuers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, which rather are occupyed to marueyle at, than for vtilitie or profite: But I thys affirme, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The other Instruments necessary for dystillation, not afore

The Instruments (sayth he) whose vse is required vnto Dystil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, are made of diuers matter, as of Glasse, Earth, or Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. But the Instruments of Glasse, doe excell all others, and for that cause are warily to be vsed: therefore for a more safegarde of the Glasse, the Chymistes wyll to draw ouer it, a hose or Cote of vnshoren clothe (which resisteth by that meanes, the stronger heate of <hi>Balneo Mariae</hi>) and after the Dystillation it maye be drawen of, and the Vessell made cleane. Such mynding to dystill by a drye heate of fire in Ashes or Sande, ought afore to fence their Instruments wyth the Lute of wysedome, made of Cley, Horsedung, Salt &amp; Flocks: but of thys Lute shall more at large be vttered, in the proper place hereafter. The sayde Instruments are to be formed of the best Earth that maye be founde in anye Countrie, for these in many causes are much commended, so that they be occupyed wyth heades of Glasse, for they be better, séeing that through them the matter as it is in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore who so is mynded to make Dystillation of Arsenick, Orepment, Cinnaber, Mercurie, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, or any such lyke Bodyes, he must remember afore to buyld a common Furnace for dystilling, rounde or square, according to

               <p>A Lute or Morter, for to parget, couer, and arme or fence the vessels, to thende that those cracke not by violence of the fire: Take the fine pouder and well searsed of Tyles, the pouder sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the beatings of Iron about the Anuyll, the pouder searsed and very fine of Sande, of eche one pounde, of fat Lute or Cley

The vesselles pargetted and couered with thys Lute or Morter, maye well abyde the violence of fire, without breaking or cracking at all, if it be somewhat thycke layde, and euen spred about the Bodies.</p>

               <p>Another fashion of Lute or Morter, often vsed of a certayne skylfull man: Take of the fine pouder of Sande searsed, one pound: of the scales or beatings of yron (about the Anuill) brought into fine pouder, so much: of Glasse beaten into fine pouder, as much: of fat Potters Earth and cleauing, thrée poundes: to which adde a third part of a pound of the shoren flox of cloth, with olde water of Tartar, or Salt water: which done, myxe the whole togither, and worke it strongly with an yron rodde, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taught.</p>

               <p>Another for to defende that the Glasses breake not by the force of fire: Take what quantitie you will of Allum, putting the same into an earthen Potte, on which poure cleare water to putrifie, after boyle the whole with diligence, and skimme it: which done, let this throughly coole, then smeare or dawbe with the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sayde mixture the Glasses without, vntill that you may well and safely bestowe them in the fire, or on Sande: these let to drye by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and doe the lyke vnto a thirde tyme.</p>

               <p>For the fast closing and stopping of Glasses, the groundes and thicker substance of that Morter of other Glasses made, is verye commodious: the selfe same doth the Meale, Lyme, and Bole Armoniacke myxed togyther, in the forme of Paste like auayle.</p>
               <p>Another Lute or Morter to be applyed about the ioynts, which so letteth or stoppeth, that the vapors in no manner breath forth: Take the fine pouders of Glasse, and Litarge of Golde sifted tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe a searse, of eche a pounde: the Meale of Wheate, twoo poundes, myxe these diligentlye, and woorke or labour them very well with the whytes of Egges in the forme of Paste, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and spredde on the one side of a wette Lynnen cloth, for to apply about the ioyntes: after that it shall be through drye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe or laye yet another Lynnen cloth vpon, and on such wyse the spirites shall be retayned.</p>
               <p>If the Glasse that any hath to set on the fire, happeneth to be cracked, it may be stopped by this meanes, that the spirits breath not forth: wette or stéepe diuers Lynnen clothes in the whytes of Egges well beaten, those applye on the cracke of the Glasse hote, the one after the other, of such sort, that as soone as the one shall be drie and harde as any crust, to bestowe an other, and in lyke maner another consequently: Such a kynde and forme of Morter is commended for the Luting and fencing all about of vessels, when as any will dystill <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or strong water, or the Oyle of Vitrioll.</p>
               <p>A Lute or Morter of wysedome on this wyse: Take fat Cley, and Horsedung, these strongly myxe and worke togither wyth Wyne, Ale, or Béere: and in the seconde labouring togither, adde shoren floxe of Clothe: and in the thirde working togither, myxe pure Wheaten Meale and Flower, with the whytes of

               <p>Or thus, take two partes of Clay, so much of Horse dung, and one part of the scales or drosse of Iron about the Anuyll: all these diligently bring to fine pouder, dissoluing after a part of Salte in water: with that water worke the whole togither, spreading the same after on a Lynnen cloth, which apply rounde about the vessell.</p>
               <p>Another Lute: Take a fast and tough earth, which after the through drying, bring into fine pouder, the same sprynckle with a little quantitie of water, to which adde Horse dung, brought to pouder: after the well myxing of all these with the whytes of Egges, diligently labour them togither, then of both ioyned, make one myxture, with which you shall Lute round about your vesselles.</p>
               <p>Another Lute: take of the excrement or vpper drosse of the Iron, one pounde and a halfe: of the Meale dust, halfe a pounde: of Glasse brought to fine pouder, one pounde: of the whytes of Egges as much as shall suffyce to myxe the whole throughlye, vnto the forme of Paste.</p>
               <p>A Lute of wysedome is made on this wyse, according to <hi>Fye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauant</hi> the Italian, in his booke of secret inuentions, with which a man maye lute vesselles of Glasse to resist a mightie heate of fire.

In colde Countries for correcting the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture excrementuous of waters, which can not be rectified nor sufficiently euaporated by the gentle heate of the sunne &amp; the aire: set the Glasse or vessell which contayneth the things dystilled into a vessell full of water, causing it gently to boyle for two or thrée dayes togither, vnto the consumption of a third part of the Oyle (if the same shall be Oyle) but if it be water dystilled, then by the lyke meanes the moysture excrementuous (if any such remayne) shall easily be consumed, and the Oyle, or the Water rectified.

It also dissolueth precious Stones, and Mynerals, that are layde to stéepe in it, as Iron, Tynne, Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone, Copper, and other lyke things. It serueth for the clensing and cléering of womens faces, washyng sometymes with it, in that this corrodeth and weareth away all spottes: It serueth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuously, for making the Sirupe of Vineger: It preserueth all matters corruptible put into it, as are Fleshe, Egges, Gourdes, Melons, Cucumbers, Orenges, Lemmons, Fennell, and to be briefe, whatsoeuer thing a man will put into it. This in lyke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dissolueth the Rheume, maketh a good and cleare voyce by drincking a little at a tyme: It mittigateth the payne in all sores, and in effect is helping in euerye matter, and neuer har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in none. If the Vineger shall be dystilled by a Lymbecke, vnto the tyme that the Fecies remayne drie, and they after bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so long in the fire, vnto the tyme that they become whyte Ashes, which after bestowed in a moyst Celler, or other moyste place, dissolueth (as the Tartare prepared doth) into an Oyle, which is of so excellent vertue, for the health of mans bodie, that a man would hardly beléeue. For gyuing a little quantitie of this by the mouth, it dissolueth the Stone of the Kidneys, and wasteth the Stone in the Bladder: The Vineger dystilled with a lyttle quantitie of the Oyle of Tartare, and pure <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> togither, preserueth the faces of women, and maketh them to appéere most comely.

By the selfe same fashion and manner is knowne the Iron, the Syluer, the Golde, the <hi>Chrysocolla,</hi> that is, the Saulder of Golde, the Copper, and such lyke. For these reasons it behooueth to ioyne and myxe the groundes with some medicine, or sharpe lycour, to the ende that euery Mettall which shall be contayned in the sediment, maye be turned into his proper excrement.

Take therefore the sediment, and bestowe the same into <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or other such medicine corrosiue, and when you shall see the water to be dryed vp and consumed, regarde and marke diligently, if the excrement of any Mettall, be not on the sediment: as if you sée on the Groundes, the excrement of Iron to be coagulated and heaped togither, you shall easily iudge the Iron to be in the sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or groundes.

I am in doubt (sayth a certaine skilfull Phisition) whether a man may beléeue, that all these properties be in the dystilled water of Celondine; séeing that according to <hi>Dioscorides</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> it is

of qualitie mightily clensing, and very hote, by reason whereof this causeth the veynes to be the cléerer of all grosse humors, and deliuereth the obstructions of the lyuer in the Iaundyse: This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is the reason, why the learned <hi>Mathiolus</hi> in his commentarie vpon <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> doth so greatly reprehend the Chymists, which take vpon them to drawe forth a Quintessence of this herbe, that they affirme to be not only commodious for their extractions, but as woonderfully profitable for the preseruing of health, and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of infinite diseases.

The fourth water which came forth, tasted in a maner as sowre as vinegar: he began dystillation in the morning at the seauenth houre, and out of halfe a measure of honie, he purchased two small vials full in a daye, in the euening he began to dystill, and continued vnto noone in a maner, he also prepared and made his fire to last vnto the ninth houre of the night: and from that houre he renued the fire vnto the sixt houre of the next morrowe: and following the fire from the sixt houre of the morning vnto twoo in the after noone: then began a great fume or smoke to arise and yssue forth into the receyuet, and that somewhat stincking, and a substance also to ascende (as when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remayned of the watrie substaunce, then did the honie as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende) then drewe I forth the Cucurbite (sayth the author) which I shoulde not haue done (but rather haue set or lyfted him hygher in the ashes) and then came the droppes forth redde, and burnt in the Limbeck, yea sowre, and in sauour or smell lyke to the oyle of the Iuniper woode in a maner: and of it fast cleauing to the sides and bottome of the Cucurbite: The remnant in the Cucurbite, was the honie of a blackish redde colour, burnt, somwhat sowre, and colouring yelowe.</p>

                  <p>Of the precypitate with Gold: this is the maner of the taking of it, and this is the dose or quantitie to be mynistred at a tyme, borrowed out of the letters written vnto <hi>Gesnerus.</hi> I haue giuen fowre Barlie cornes wayght, sometimes of this powder, with conserue of Roses, tymelie in the morning, but the pacient after refrained meate vnto dynner time, and made then a small meale or dynner, but a better supper. Through the benefite of which, for the space of two yeares after, yea thrée yeares and more, the pacient had perfite health of bodie, as he reported. Yet the mynde of the best practysioners is, that the precypitate, how so euer the same be corrected, doth alwayes painefully torment the head and stomacke, especially of tender bodies. Wherefore although this may séeme to helpe sundrie disseases, to purge the belly mightily, &amp; to procure strong vomytes: yet doth it many tymes procure the blooddy flixe to insue, and a veyne to breake in the breast, through the painefull inforsing, and strayning to vomyte, Which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse thought meete for husband menne, that haue strong stomacks to abyde the drawing of it: so that to them it is porfitable, and maye helpe sundrye grieffes and disseases.</p>

The first water come, and dropped into the eyes, doth marueylously cleare, and preserue the sight of the eyes: and washing the face with this water, maketh after a most comely &amp; bewtyfull face, it preserueth youth, and putteth of olde age, it breaketh and dyssolueth the stone of the kydneys, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the pacient to pysse, which otherwyse is letted by a certayne fleshie stopping in the way: this also cureth all maner of wounds happening in any part of the bodye, and of what condicion so euer they be, by the washing with this water, and the applying vppon of Lynnen cloathes wette in this water, which sundrye tymes exercised, wyll shewe so marueylous a working, (as though the same were done by the blessed hand of God onely.) This besydes mightily helpeth the personnes in a consumption, and all maner of rewmes, and the coughe. This water also bathed or rather fomentedon the <hi>Sciatica</hi> or ache in the hyppe, causeth the payne forthwith to ceasse.

               <p>This also doth marueylouslie helpe the Plewrisse, by giuing one

The Baulme is a marueylous lycour, for who that hath paine of the flankes or bowelles, by taking two drammes of this Baulme in the mouth, shall spedilie be eased and deliuered: this doth lyke helpe the cough, the rewme, the coldnesse of the head, and the stomacke: and for all woundes of the headde, this is a most synguler remedie, by annoynting all the headde about once a daye, for this pierceth into the brayne, and euen to the stomacke alowe. This also dissolueth any swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling happening in any part of the bodye, and in short tyme. This besides cureth the quartaine Ague, by annoynting all the bodie with it, in omytting no part vntouched, and the same in a shorte tyme: to be briefe, the Aucthour knewe at no tyme, any sicknesse or dissease, which he dyd not cure with this Baulme: in that this auayleth as well in the hote sicknesses, as in the colde: for the colde this heateth, and the hote sicknesses this (of a certayne hydde propertie) cooleth.

But the tyme when to bury or set this potte into the earth, ought to be about the first or second day of August, &amp; to be drawne or taken forth of the earth agayne, must be in the moneth of Februarie: which opened, the oyle wyll then appeare, as if it were fyftie yeares olde. But when you mynde to bury the potte, then put in these insewing: of Rosemary flowers, three poundes, of <hi>Lignum aloes</hi> sixe ounces, of Frankensence, and <hi>Bolellium,</hi> of each ten ounces.

This oile also auaileth against poyson, &amp; helpeth <hi>Petechiae,</hi> &amp; swellings or knobs, by anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it on the places, &amp; that with expedicion. And with this oyle hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Author done many singular practises, to his high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>An oyle of the Orrenge flowers, take Melone seedes wel broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so many as you wyl, of these straw a part in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bottome of a broade or gallie glasse, on which straw a bedde of the flowers of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Orrenges, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that straw another course of the séedes: which done, let them so stand for a day, after the throwing away of the flowers, put in fresh flowers to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seedes, in like order as aboue taught: this doe for su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry dayes togither, in shyfting the flowers, vntyl the seedes haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased the vertue &amp; sauour of the Orrendge flowers, which sprinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; wette somwhat with good Rosewater, put vp into sware lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen bagges, these wryng harde in a presse, pressing the oyle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3208:166"/>The oyle of the Iasemyne flowers maye in a lyke maner bée purchased, by ordering the flowers as aboue vttered: and if you thincke the yéelde not sufficient at a tyme, then maye you increase the same (in my opinion) with the iourdaine Almondes cleane scraped, and broken after discrecion.</p>
               <p>An oyle of the Damaske Roses, maye in a lyke maner be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned: if so be you breake Almondes into small partes, being cleane scraped before (and not blaunched) and ordered as aboue taught, of the oyle of Orrendge flowers: which after put into bags, presse forth an oyle.</p>
               <p>An oyle of Roses by sunning, is prepared and made on this wyse, as <hi>Rogerius</hi> in his fowrth treatyse and eyght Chapter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth. Take the Flowers of gréene Roses, and fyll the glasse with the flowers and oyle, in such maner: that to one pounde of Roseleaues, be two poundes of oyle added, which dilygently stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, set the glasse in the Sunne, for fortie dayes, sturring about the flowers once a daye. After such a decoction, strayne it through a Lynnen cloath, into a Bason of fayre colde water, and labour or styrre the oyle about with a Hasill sticke whyte scraped, after shift the oyle into another Bason of cold water and sturring it, and this doe tenne tymes togyther. For through this often washing, it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaseth a coldnesse in working, and a lesser drynesse. By which it doth after more coole, and moysten. Also the substaunce put into a glasse &amp; set in the Sunne, vntyll the moysture which entreth the powres, may through the same be consumed. In a colde countrey, where through a weake heate of the ayre this can not be decocted, let the glasse be set into a panne of water, that it may there softlye boyle for two or three dayes, vnto a thyrde part of the oyle awaye: &amp; if that countrey hath not oyle Olyue, then draw an oyle of freshe Nuttes scraped, with which make your oyle of Roses: or otherwise vse olde Nuttes scraped cleane, and stieped for two dayes in colde water, after let an oyle be pressed forth. Whereof the Aucthour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth, that the mylke drawne or made of freshe Nuttes, may so safely be giuen to the sicke of the Ague at all tymes, in a cold coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: as the Almonde mylke, in a hote countrey. This oyle also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue taught, hath sundrye properties, for if a pacient vexed with the Ague, be daylye or often annoynted about the forehead, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3208:166"/>
temples, and paulmes of the handes, the soles of the féete, and on the beating veynes of the wrestes, this note onely represseth the payne of the head, and other partes, but altereth the heate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth sléepe, yet this in no case, may be done in the sick day, where you hope of the vniuersall or particular action. A singuler reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, that the yolkes of Egges be laboured with the oyle of Roses, and layde playster wyse on the region of the Lyuer, or vpon a fyrie impostume: which being once, or twyse applyed, doth marueylouslie mitigate paine, and doth dissolue the fumositie, and sharpnesse of matter. And the same cleanseth the place or swelling to fal, &amp; remooueth the rednesse from the place. This oyle also mixt, with a lyke wayght of the iuyce of plaintayne, for a glyster in the blooddy fluxe, or perylous scouring with blood is greatly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, this doth spéedily bring woundes to a scarre, and mytigateth the payne, by repressing the matter.</p>
               <p>These oyles afore placed, although they be prepared and gotten without distyllation, or but by pressing out, or otherwyse made by the Sunne: yet would I not omytte them, in that these formes and wayes, séeme easie, comely, and to skyll inuented: and oyles being thus prepared, may aptly be applyed to mens vse, and vtilytie.</p>
               <p>The oyle of Violettes, is prepared &amp; made of Violettes, in the lyke maner, as the oyle of Roses (out of <hi>Rogerius</hi>) and serueth to lyke purposes, as the oyle of Roses, sauing that the one ofter the newe making is laxatiue, and the other bynding. If with a lyke wayght of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuyce of Mercurie, this oyle be applied in glyster wise, in the sharpe daylie, and renewing Agues, and Tertians, the same gently doth louse the bellie, and easilye expelleth the superfluities, by the excrements sent forth.

and made after the maner ensewing, borrowed out of a certayne written booke in the Italian tongue: take of Rosemarie flowers, a good quantitie, putting them into a potte, and thrusting them harde downe with a staffe. After powre vpon of oyle Olyue, so much as shall be sufficent, that a part of the potte remayne emptie: which done, close and stoppe dilygently the mouth of the potte with paste, that no ayre breath forth. The potte ordered on this wyse, set or burie in horse doong, not made of haye: in such wyse letting the potte stande, that the doong be more then thrée fingers aboue the mouth of the potte: the same so standing for fortie dayes, drawe after forth, and kéepe the oyle carefully. When you wyll vse of the oyle, strayne it through a cloath. This mightily helpeth in the grieffes and paynes of the Loynes, the ache in the hyppes, the Armes, and other partes.

Fyrst, I tooke (sayth he) such a quantitie of seedes, as I thought necessarye, but a fiue or sixe poundes alwaeys: those I so stamped or beate in a grosse manner, that I left no one seede vnbroken, which I then powred into the Cucurbyte. After I powred vpon so much scalding or verie hote water, that well coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the seedes, and then set on the Lymbecke or head, close luted in the ioynt about, and stopped the nose, that no ayre breathed forth: which standing to putrify for thrée or fowre dayes, I after distylled with a soft fyre, &amp; a fayre oyle followed (so that the water by which the oyle passeth, be very colde) as you were afore taught. This one matter is worthy to be considered, that the oyle of Annise séedes can not in the Summer tyme be distylled at all, for that theyr spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites then are ouer subtyll, &amp; the Fennell seedes at that tyme much subtyller then them: which they euaporate through the heate in that season, howe easie so euer you make your fire vnder, or labour you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> distyllacion. So that the aptest and meetest tyme for the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styllacion of these, is in the wynter: in that the colder the ayre shall then be, so much the sooner, when the oyle shall fall into the Receauer, wyll it be cowrded togyther, lyke to <hi>Camphora.</hi> Which when after you shall strayne through a fayre cloath, all the water then runneth through, but the oyle remayneth on the cloath: which I after (sayth the Aucthour) dyssolued in a gallie or broade mouth glasse set in a stewe or hote house, and the flewme so seperated.</p>
               <p>In the distylling of such maner of oyles, must first be considered and noted, that a man may not prepare and distyll more then halfe a pounde at a tyme. After remembring, that the matter to be dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stylled, be brayed or broken in a morter, after a grosse maner, and not in a subtyll or fine powder. To this matter then let a due quantitie of pure water be powred, that it maye couer the séedes, which after powre into a copper Cucurbite, and well myxed togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, set on a copper head, close luted to the bodye in the ioynt, that no ayre breath forth. This distyllacion then ought to be done through a vessell fylled with colde water, the tynne or leaden pype retching to the nose of the head, whereby the oyle (in the distylling)
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3208:168"/>
may not burne. All which thus prepared, make a very soft or slow fire in the begynning, vntyl the Furnace waxeth hote, then increase your heate or fire, more &amp; more, as the matter beginneth to distyll: the water &amp; oyle all come, seperate the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after art. When this begynneth to distyll, you may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw some of the fire, and marke whether the fyre being at that stay, the distyllacion neuerthelesse procéedeth, then must the stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger heate or fyre be left, and the other followed and mayntained: but if otherwise, then let the heate be increased. Thyrdly must be considered &amp; learned, that the oile fyrst distilleth, so that at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the second, or thyrde oyle, the receauer may be changed. And within an howres space in a maner, wyll halfe an ounce be distilled and gathered in the receauer. So that when no more ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidnesse appeareth on high, in the Cucurbite, then wyl no more matter distyll forth: and the work vpon this sight, is fully ended.</p>
               <p>The oyle of Annise seedes, is thus prepared &amp; drawne: take of Annise seedes (for this is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon forme &amp; waye, vnto the distyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling also of oyles, out of other séedes) one pounde, these after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grosse beating, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t into a horned or croke necked body, to which let the receauer be artly closed &amp; fastned, setting the body the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into a pot of ashes, the same distyl with a most soft fyre, &amp; you shall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a water &amp; an oyle in the receauer. The water you shal draw forth by a reuoluing or repeting againe of the whole substance: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> oyle remaining or tarrying behind in the body, whose vse serueth vnto the collicke passion, &amp; paine of the bowels. But of the water is an electuary made with Sugar, in the forme of losings or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus christi,</hi> of which one table at a tyme, eyther after dynner, or after supper may be giuen or taken. For this strengthneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack &amp; digestion, &amp; putteth away or expelleth wynd. This at any time take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or vsed profiteth, but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning especially: &amp; helpeth the lungs, the cough, &amp; the obstructions or stoppings of choller, &amp; helpeth the inward parts. The vse of it properly, is in droppes.</p>
               <p>The oyle of Annise is much more in property, then the Annise it selfe, and in working myghtier. Yet the naturall heate, of the whole Annise seede, can neuer be so exactly purchased, as to draw forth &amp; seperate a perfite substance: although an artificiall prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may be wrought, &amp; the same by mans industry. For like
<pb facs="tcp:3208:169"/>
as any meate, that the same may be taken &amp; eaten, without daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or harme, it néedeth before an outward preparation: euen so must a lyke preparation be wrought in medicines, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyller parts be seperated from the grosser, before those be applied or taken within the body: for on such wyse prepared and ordered, may any medicine worke the easier, &amp; performe the proper action in the body, without harme to the pacient. The vse of this oyle much auayleth in the gyddinesse of the head, the harde fetching of breath, procéeding through a dangerous Rewme in a maner suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focating or choking the person, in the weaknesse of stom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ck and wyndinesse, in the dropsie, in other colde diseases, and those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of wynd. This also much profiteth the members lacking blood; and the synew partes, as the stomack, the veynes, the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the bellye, and the whyte fluxe of the wombe this mightilye stayeth. This oyle may be taken or ministred by droppos, in gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin certain droppes of it eyther in wine, or in breath in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or in tyme of necessitie.</p>
               <p>The oyle of Fennell séedes helpeth the head, but the eyes espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, the kydneys &amp; bladder: Tables may be made of the same, of lyke propertyes, and vnto the same vses: or certayne droppes may be mynistred alone, at any time: or else taken morning, and euening. And an oyle is drawne, out of the drye séedes, without any other addicion, it is very pleasaunt and swéete of taste, as the Aucthour prooued and felt of the same: the same also in colour is whyte, that first distylleth.</p>
               <p>The oyle of Cummyne drawne, is profitable to woundes, ioyning néere vnto the Mylt, the swellings of the body procéeding of a colde cause, which sometymes happeneth and is the cause, why the vryne is stayed backe: vnto this vse may a droppe, or two, be mynistred in Ferne water, or in Tables, if they be made with it.</p>
               <p>The oyle out of Henbane séedes, prepared in the same maner, as the oyle of Roses, by the discription of <hi>Rogerius,</hi> auayleth the lyke, that the oyle of the apples of Mandrake doth. It auayleth also in the hote ioynt aches, in repressing mightily the payne, and causing an astonishment to those places applyed: in burning and in excoriations, it may procure and make a lyttle scarre, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate

               <p>The selfe same Aucthour, doth otherwyse prepare the oyle, which worketh stronger and to greater purpose in the abouesayd burning. Take on Mydsomer eue, the toppes, flowers &amp; leaues, with which let a new potte be fylled, hauing in the bottom a lytle

hole, and let the mouth of the vpper pot be dyligently stopped, which set into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of another pot standing vnder, the mouth of which lute round about with the other, that no ayre breath forth: this done, set the pots so deepe into the earth that they may wholy be couered and buried in the earth, after let them stande for a whole yeare in the grounde: at the ende of which tyme, drawe the pottes forth, and you shall finde in the neather potte a cleare oyle, which by the heate of the fumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the earth, is drawne forth from the Henbane. This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of instruction is founde perfiter, in the discription of the oyle of yuie berries (where is otherwyse lefte in the earth for sixe monethes) with this are members labouring and sore payned with dayly fluxes falling to them, annoynted.</p>

But the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner howe this oyle ought to be distylled, is on this wyse: I tooke (sayth the Aucthour) a pynt full of Iunyper berryes, which I brake somewhat small, vpon which I powred pure water, such a quantitie as verie well couered them, after I powred the whole into such a copper vessell, as the same is, in which the <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> most commonly is distylled, and with a copper pype also passing through colde water, dyd I distyll, hauing vnder a bygge Recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, fastened to the pype, which myght well receyue or holde fowre measures of lycour: and on this wyse, dyd the oyle distyll &amp; come, with the water. But another instrument I vsed standing on the head, which I fylled with colde water, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better cooling of the spyrites, that they burned not in the comming. Out of the abouesayde quantity of berryes, I neuer drew aboue three oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of perfite oyle.

               <p>By pressing out also in this maner or on this wyse, we drawe &amp; get an oyle not euyll sauouring: take of Iuniper berryes broken, fyrst myxt with burning water, and after with oyle Olyue: let them boyle a lyttle, or at the least let these be infused togyther, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sturring them with a spattle, for eyght dayes, then powring them into a bodie, distyll in a Furnace after art, the oyle after swymmyng aboue, gather into another glasse: you may then put into it a lytle of <hi>Angelica,</hi> or some other thing a lyttle brused before.</p>

               <p>An oyle out of yuie berryes, is gotten and made many wayes, especially by those wayes taught aboue, in the drawing an oyle out of bay berryes: this oyle purchased, auaileth against cold cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, especially against the cold ioynt aches.

In the Collicke passion, and partes stuffed with much soft &amp; clammy flewme, let two or three droppes of it be ministred or taken with broth, vnto the cutting a sunder, and breaking away of it.

For this doth heale outwardly freshe and gréene wounds. It stateth, the yssewing of blood &amp; water, out of wounds.

               <p>A Water or oyle of Cynamon, is to be requyred and coueted before other waters, and Oyles: as the Cynamon it selfe in respect to other spyces. And the Cynamon is of a subtyll heate, through which it especially auayleth in the wynter, in that it strengthneth then more the stomacke, and marueylously putteth away all euyll and corrupt moystures of the stomacke, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth it from corrupting at all: it also sharpeneth the sight, and openeth any maner stopping of the veynes and marueylously comforteth the heart. But an oyle distylled of it, doth answere in generall to a naturall baulme, which within helpeth all putrifac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without the body cureth all freshe woundes or vlcers. And the distylled water mightily auayleth in all colde diseases, as well of men, as women, especially which haue a stomacke so affected, that they haue no appetyte. When the spirites also bée weakned, or the pacient weake, a draft of this water, with a litle of good Malmesie, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the iuyce of the Pomegranate, taken by the mouth, woonderfully auayleth and helpeth. Men in a maner dead, by dropping or powring a droppe or two into the mouth, doth recouer the person in a swoone or traunce: especially which to olde men many tymes hapneth, this is the presentest remedy. Mydwiues and other motherlye women with vs, carry of this water with them, and vse of the same with prosperous successe, to yong women in the daungerous traueyle of chylde. For doth in the hastening, and helping forward of the byrth, it is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyest remedy. The sundry maners, that a water and oyle may be distylled &amp; gotten out of the Cynamon, shal by a few examples here be vttered. Some there be which stiepe the Cinamon before in Rosewater, others in whyte wyne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many drawe it in a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbyte luted about, but then is the substaunce lightly burned. If the same be distylled in a bladder (which the Apotetaryes vse) it can not then be done without the great quantity of Cynamon. The best maner and waye of drawing these, is in the vapour of boyling water: but as touching the rehersall of these, is here sufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:3208:178"/>The Poticaries (certaine yeares past) were woont, to stiepe the Cynamon for certayne dayes, in Rosewater, as that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the heart, and was alwayes applyed for the recouerie of strength: and for that a lyttle quantity of the water, hath not his smell, the water is estéemed of the lesser value with many. And for that cause better it is, that the Cynamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be stieped before the distyllation, in olde pleasaunt whyte wyne, for a certayne tyme: For on such wyse prepared, the distylled water is caused the excellenter, and in piercing more effectuous.</p>
               <p>The maner of preparing a water out of Cynamon, which <hi>Ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerus</hi> receiued of a certaine friend of his, that made great tryals, and often distylled the same. Let one pound of chosen Cynamon be gotten, which beat so fyne, that the powder may passe through a fine sieue, yet the whole you may not worke to powder: after put al into a Cucurbite, on which powre of the water of Borrage of Buglosse, of Endiue, and of baulme, of each halfe a pynt, these let stand to infuse in a glasse close stopped, for fowre or fiue daies. After out of this Cucurbite or glasse body, let the whole be shyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a copper body, which you shall place in a Furnace with his head set vpon, &amp; cooling beake fastened to after art: and beware that the body stand not ouer nigh the fyre, but that an yron plate full of holes, be fyxed in the myddle betweene, that the fyre may so vent through, and the vapour be sent vpwarde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fyrst kyndle or beginne with a soft fyre, vntyll the distyllacion be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what come, but increase after the fyre bygger and bygger, that it may the spéedilyer distyll forth. When a measure is come or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled forth, seperate y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a part, as principal, setting vnder another Receauer, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same which next distylleth &amp; is gathered, is much inferiour to the first, and may serue for new Cinamon, to be stye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the same. And in the same maner, may a water be distilled out of Cloues. Where to be noted, that a maner and way of coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be vsed: as when the water beginneth to waxe hote; to draw forth the same, and powre in colder water.</p>
               <p>A water of Cinamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if any wyl distyl by a bladder made of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, togyther with a pype fyxed to it, passing through a vessell of cold water: a great quantity then shal be distylled togyther, for it would not easily be drawne in a small quantity. But in a Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
<pb facs="tcp:3208:179"/>
dilygently luted, this speciall care is to be had, that your stuffe burne not to the bottome, whereby your water then distyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling forth may sauour of the burning. That if the fyre shall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter increased, an oyle also distylleth, and so much the more, if the Cynamon shall be stieped in good whyte wyne.

               <p>Certayne others there be, which follow &amp; vse this maner: take of water sixteene partes, of Cynamon one parte, which grosely was powdred togyther, the same after put into a Cucurbite to stiepe close stopped, for a certayne tyme, as eyther fowre, or fiue dayes: after this set on the head close to the body, and distyll the substaunce with a most temperate heate in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> which excéedeth not the heate of mans vryne in the fyrst co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming forth, for so may a most pleasaunt water be drawne and purchased. In the tyme of this boyling, may hote water be powred in, that a lyke quantity continew styll, for doubte of wasting awaye, and you shall gather into a Receauer the distinct waters: as the fyrst a mightie water, the second of lesser strength, and the thyrd feble. And in the lyke maner may all other spyces be ordered and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled: and many distyllers there be, which purchase by the same doing, an oyle and water.</p>
               <p>Another maner brieflie, in purchasing the water of Cynamon: take of chosen Cynamon two ounces, of water, a fowrth part of a measure, of wyne so much, these after the myxing, distyll, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taught.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3208:180"/>When the water thus commeth, you shall néede thrée persons to stand by, the one and first to consider &amp; tende the head, and pype, that he or shee alwayes cooleth them, with lynnen cloathes wette in colde water &amp; applied after discretion on the head and pype, the other standing by the Receauer, let him obserue and marke the colour of the water distylling into the receauer: the thyrde, that he marke and tende the glasse in such maner, as when neede shall be, to retche or put vnder speedily another Receauer, &amp; to take the other againe, &amp; stop dilygently. The water distilling hath fowre differences, for which cause it shal neede fowre sundry receiuers. The first water that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, is somewhat fattie and strong, and of this, is the best: and as this proceedeth in distylling, &amp; a mylkie colour beginneth to come, then gather the second water, which in his fortitude lacketh of the first, or is of a weaker vertue: &amp; when this colour is vanished, &amp; that the water comming forth, as a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter distylled out of other matters, remember &amp; consider the thirde water, which must lyke be gathered a part or seuerall by it selfe. When this water shalbe turned into a yellowe colour, or chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged yellowishe, gather then the fowrth water, which distylleth or commeth forth in a small quantity: and the worke is at an ende, when certayne droppes begynne to appeare of a redde colour, at which sight ceasse, for the rest behynd is of no force, nor serueth to any vse or purpose. Besides take héede, least through the force of the fyre your substance ouer high boyleth vp, &amp; through the same may the distyllacion procéede amysse, &amp; in daunger of losing the whole stuffe. Of which to be out of doubt, you shall auoyde &amp; end that care (by good gouernment) in the space of one howre.</p>
               <p>Thrée droppes of this water, myxed to other waters of lyke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie aunswering, doe helpe the falling sicknesse. If with this, the veynes vnder the tongue be aptlie rubbed, doth helpe the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie persons in a short tyme.</p>
               <p>Out of the Cynamon may by distyllacion, but a lyttle oyle be gotten, for which cause in the steede of it, we may often vse the water of Cynamon, especially the same which is first gathered, for this hath singular properties contayned in it.</p>

And although I haue béen a long time oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed about the same, yet for that I now waxe aged, &amp; set ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour or enuie aside, for that cause, will I fully open to you, what I many times, haue experienced, by this worthy secrete.

For it is celestiall gift, reuealed to vs vnworthy of God, which neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phisitions before knew, nor the Philosophers also which laboured in the déepe secretes of Alchymie, found. But I take God to witnesse, that by sundry tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiles, which a I long time haue bestowed (as you know) in the secrete Art of Alchymie, haue nowe brought to passe, that I haue knowen by experience, such an efficacie to be of this matter, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> full to vtter of the singuler vertues of it, my wittes will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, &amp; for that cause I reclude the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the pit of a penitent breast.</p>
               <p>To come to the matter, conceaue this secrete, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, mans blood, and let the blood be of healthfull men, about xxx. yéeres of age, out of which draw according to Art, the fowre Elements, as you wel haue learned and know by the rules of Alchymie, and diligently stoppe eche Element a part, that no ayre breath forth.</p>
               <p>For the water of it auayleth in all sicknesses, as well hotte as colde, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same is of a hid nature &amp; propertie, &amp; reduceth vnto a temperament the qualitie decayed, and doth especially auaile in pacients corrupted in the spirituall members, &amp; expelleth poyson from the heart.

And briefely, all matters found in the Lungs, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall members, this singularly purgeth, &amp; preserueth those pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

healeth any impostume of the side.</p>
               <p>The Ayre also distylled of it, much auayleth vnto the aforesaid matters, &amp; perhaps more, then the water, &amp; doth especially auayle in young persons, that they may perseuer &amp; continue in the same state of strength &amp; youthfull comlinesse, if they vse now &amp; than of it, &amp; in a little quantitie at a time. And it is in a manner of such a vertue, that it suffereth the blood by no meanes to putrifie, nor flewme to superabound or haue the ouerhand, nor that choller to burne. Further it doth increase blood aboue measure, and for that cause, it behoueth such vsing it, to blede often by vaine. The same Element besides doth open the vaine &amp; synewes, &amp; if any vertue shall be deminished in them, this reduceth it vnto a dew tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament.

If in any member also, any superfluous matter consisteth, or commeth apt to putrifying, this forth with dissolueth and taketh it awaye, and if it findeth any thing, that is diminished, it strengthneth the same by restoring. And this Element auayleth in the Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the fyre purchased of it, is more precious and maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousser, and auayleth vnto all those, which the ayre helpeth, yea and vnto that which more is, of the man dead, that it restored to lyfe; this is here so ment and vnderstanded.

Paris, which before laye in a manner as dead, and immediately after he had receaued this downe, became agayne to himselfe somewhat, and within an howre after dyed. And this I mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, and tryed in many the lyke.

               <p>THe preparing and making of an Oyle of <hi>Antymonie,</hi> which I receyued and learned of a certayne friend, is on this wyse: take of crude <hi>Antymonie,</hi> and of crude Tartare, of each halfe a pound, these after the beating togyther in a morter, or labouring on a stone, put into a pot well glased before, the mouth of which let be close couered, with a couer &amp; lute, that no ayre after breath forth, and the pot so prepared, giue to the potter, to set among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pottes to bake in his Furnace. For by this burning it is made a paste, and blackishe or swartishe redde of colour, rounde formed, and easily brought to powder: which after the potte is through colde, &amp; the pot opened, let the substaunce be taken forth, beaten, &amp; brought agayne into fine powder, after powred againe into another pot well glased, on which powre distylled vineger so much, that it may lie two fingers breadth aboue the substance: this pot then set on a Furnace to be heated, that the vyneger may approche &amp; drawe to a rednesse, and with the same coloured. And it ought to stande on the Furnace, for thrée or fowre howers, the vyneger after shyfted into a distyllatory of glasse, &amp; other vineger powred vpon: and the same so often doe (I suppose sixe, or eyght tymes) vntyll the vyneger be no more coloured. All that coloured vineger powred forth, distyll by a Lymbecke, that the vyneger may so be seperated by distyllacion, &amp; the redde substaunce abyde or remaine in the bottome. Which done, breake the glasse, taking the whole forth, which cleaueth or sticketh to the glasse, &amp; put into an ypocrase bagge made of whyte cloath, the same hang in a cold &amp; moyst Seller, where the oyle wyll distyll forth drop by drop, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a glasse standing vnder. And in this maner, was a certayne Practisioner, woont often to prepare and make the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3208:191"/>An oyle of <hi>Antimonie</hi> also is gotten after this maner, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to <hi>Gesnerus,</hi> by a most skylful practisioner, in the making of this matter. Let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Antimonie</hi> be brought into most fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and powred into a glasse bodie, on which a most sharpe wyne vyneger powred, and the same distylled, stiepe on a soft heate of fire, (least the glasse breake) so long tyme, vntyll the vineger be chaunged redde. The same thus coloured, powre into another glasse, and on the Feces powre new distylled vineger, vntyll the same in lyke maner hath purchased a redde colour. These pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings vpon, and addicions of new vineger on the Feces, ought so often to be repeated, vntyl the powders send out of them no more rednesse. The vineger all gathered ought to be distylled with a soft fyre, vntyll the rednesse begynning a lytle &amp; lytle to thicken, seame to aryse &amp; appeare in the head. Then are the vessels to be cooled, &amp; the redde lycour, set to dygest vnder hote horse doong for xl. dayes, vntyl it attayneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfite forme of an oyle. The same some affyrme, to be so sweet as sugar: to cease al paints of wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, &amp; to heale them perfitly as certayne wryte: besydes it doth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylously cure throublesome and tedious vlcers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; such Cankred.</p>
               <p>Another secrete of <hi>Antimonie,</hi> which also vnto the white work, not meanly auayleth: take af <hi>Antimonie</hi> brought to powder, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>xi. ounces, of Tartare calcyned .ix. ounces, these after the myxing togyther, put into a goldsmythes melting pot, which closely luted &amp; stopped, set into a Furnace for two howres, &amp; it wyl well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyned, the same after it be cooled, and the mouth of the pot opened, you shall finde the substance in the pot, to be of a darcke ashie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, myxed with certayne yellow spottes. This then beaten in a morter, put into hote water, and boyled in an yron panne, let the whole be after distylled by fyltering, which distylleth lyke to lye. The first water yssewing is redde &amp; troubled, which poured after on the Feces, wyll distyll &amp; be gathered cleare. This water then euaporate in a glasse Cucurbite in sande, vntyll the substance be left drye, or the moysture resolued. But this matter left in the sande distyll, as first with a soft fyre, after with a stronger, vntyll the spirites of the <hi>Antimonie</hi> begyn to ascend, &amp; begyn as it were to colour the necke of the Lymbeck lyke golde. Then set the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it selfe, be cyrculated. Some report, that if thynne syluer plates be layd in this that they are wholye gylded, &amp; appeare like golde, in such maner, that rubbed with the touch stone, they yet
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3208:191"/>
appeare as gold. But I suppose (sayth the Aucthour) that it wyll be farre better, if the first troubled water coloured be kept a part, and new powred on the Feces: for peraduenture the seconde and thyrd water, would draw &amp; carry with them more of the rednesse of the <hi>Antimonie,</hi> which after gathered into one, may then be drawne with a soft fyre, vntyll the oylie rednesse appearing.</p>
               <p>Another maner, which a certaine practisioner often exercised &amp; vsed: let first the rednesse of the <hi>Antimonie,</hi> drawne many tymes by the distylled vineger, as is aboue taught, &amp; let the exhaltacion of the vineger be after done on a soft fyre, and the redde powder preserued in the bottome. Let the Quintessence then of wyne be powred to it, &amp; stande to cyrculate togyther for forty dayes: this after may safely be ministred by the mouth, into the bodie.</p>

That if it shall be repeated seuen tymes, let the redde vineger in a glasse body dilygently luted, be distilled in ashes: and a whyte vineger wyl yssew, but the oyle remaineth behynd in the bottome. Which on this wyse done, and the spring or Cunduicte water left so with the oyle for a tyme, that softly powred forth, and distylled againe, the sauour af the vineger may so be taken from the oyle. The same after it shall be thus twyse togyther ordred, that is, the second tyme Cunduite water shalbe powred vpon, &amp; by distyllacion shall after seperate the same, you

shall then obtayne a swéete oyle of <hi>Antimonie,</hi> in the bottome of the Cucurbite or glasse bodie. But this forme and maner of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stylling, can not so well be vttered and discrybed in wordes, as by demonstracion to the eye, and syght of the same done.</p>
               <p>This waye and manner also of making the Oyle of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,</hi> is not to be contempned: which as it should seame, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus Paracelsus,</hi> accoumpted for a rare secrete.

               <p>The oyle or Quintessence of <hi>Antimonie,</hi> when the same is prepared and made after a dewe fourme and maner, is a most precious medycine, to be vsed as well within the bodie, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and the quantity of one drop giuen at a tyme by the mouth, eyther with wyne or broth, or any other distylled water, doth as well emptie the bodie by vomytting, as downewarde by syege: &amp; this giuen to a sicke person, doth throughly cure him of any crude, and maligne kynde of sicknesse: as by tryall, a further truth may be knowne. And this locally applyed on wicked vlcers, doth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylously clense them. The making of which oyle or quintesse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is on this wyse: take a quantity of the strongest vineger, the same distyl thrise ouer, to which ad of <hi>Antimonie</hi> so much as you wyl, brought to fine powder, these put togyther in a body of glasse, but let the vyneger flote thrée fingers aboue the <hi>Antimonie,</hi> then sturre them very wel togither, &amp; setting the body on hote imbers, let the substaunce boyle a lytle space, vntyll the vineger become redde, which after the being redde, let then setle, vntyl it appeare cleare, the same empty into another body, and on the feces powre the lyke quantity of distylled vineger, as afore taught: the same a whyles boyle, &amp; empty after into another body: &amp; doe on this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner so often, vntyl the vineger wyl no more be changed, &amp; become redde: this done, the feces throw away, and all the redde vineger gathered, powre into a crooke necked body or Retort, that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well luted, and distyll the vyneger, which wyll yssew forth cleare &amp; whyte: but take dilygent heede, when the redde droppes begynne to distyll: at the sight of which, draw away the receauer with the vyneger, putting vnder another glasse, and the fyre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease stronger &amp; stronger, vnto the ende of the worke, or that all the substance be yssewed forth: for this come, is the quintessence of the <hi>Antimonie,</hi> which diligently kéepe in a glasse close stopped, that no ayre breath forth.

But now this blacke substaunce brought againe to pouder, he powred into a Crucible made of the best earth, new, and neuer wetted, and set on a meane fyre to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyne, vnto the performance of which matter, he vsed almost a day &amp; a halfe, and sturred the same al the whyles with a large spattle of yron, styll and continually about (but some, as I remember, do calcyne the same in an earthen skellet or pan) but he rather sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the colour to come the darcker through the yron vessell (and the whyles dyd a most wicked sauour of Brimstone continually breath forth) through which (he reported) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whyles he was thus bus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The pot in the ende sheweth burned, and although it be cract and hath a cleft in it (as the lyke he reporteth, his pot had) yet may the same last and serue vnto the ende of the worke, vnlesse the cleft shall waxe and be greater. After these, let it be taken forth, and

The Crucible must be couered with another pot, that it may the soner be molten. When this shall be through colde, adde to it one dram of <hi>Chrysocolla,</hi> which brought to powder, shalbe mixed in a morter, and the whole powred into a crucible, that it may be mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, then occupy a long yron spattle, or rodde, in that a certayne peryll inseweth by touching the substance, howsoeuer it were, if we may beleeue him. An the melting or ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning, which is hardly done at the first (in that for an howre or more standing in the fire, with great coales layd round about, &amp; blowne after with a byggs payre of bellowes, the Crucible, all the whyles appearing redde hote, the substaunce scarcely melted in that space (yet after the same was molte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he powred it on a marble or smoth stone, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to length, or rather in thicke and round plates.

               <p>Another maner of preparing the <hi>Stibium,</hi> take what quantity you wyll, the same bring to powder: but first wash it well in cold cunduite water, vntyl in the same washing this appeareth pure, after wash this againe in the water of Roses, &amp; the blessed thistle, which let the substance drincke in.

               <p>How the redde spirites, is drawne or gotten out of <hi>Antimonie,</hi> is the most rare secrete, of a certaine notable Chyrurgian. Take of pure <hi>Antimonie</hi> two or thrée pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, this dryed &amp; brought into fine powder, put into an earthen Cucurbite, vnder which make a soft fire in the beginning, for twenty howers space, after increase your fire somewhat hoter, the next stronger &amp; stronger, vnto the ende of .xxxvi. howers. In the belly of the earthen Receauer or Cucurbite, on the syde a high, fasten in a woodden pynne, which now and then drawne out of the hole, doth vtter and expresse the colour of the spirite breathing further and cleauing too, as fyrst whyte, next yellowishe and yellowe, and last manifestly redde. This sublymation being thus perfourmed, and the vesselles through colde (the powder sublymed by force of the fyre) let it be purged from the Receauer eyther with a feather, or soft Pares foote, and put into a Retorte, which set into <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> where let a seconde exhaltacion be wrought, which also receyue and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a glasse or earthen receauer. For in the same maner shall you purchase a powder wholie sanguine in color. And the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers into which the spirites or fume of the <hi>Antimonie</hi> breatheth, ought alwayes o be cooled, with Lynnen cloathes wet in cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; applyed vpon.

Then the bellyes of the receauers ought to be set vpwardes, and the mouthes into which the Cucurbites are fixed, placed downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, as the figure hereafter playner demonstrateth.

But let the necke be so large, that the hande to the elbow may easily be put in, and drawne out againe, euen as this figure here to the eye, doth more perfitly expresse.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:3208:199"/>
vnto <hi>Gesnerus</hi>: I haue (sayth he) throughly reuolued &amp; called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to iudgement the essence of the red <hi>Antimonie</hi> prepared, &amp; I finde that this glasse, not to be the same of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old Philosophers, of which they write so many matters, although of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like it may be made, in that it is more earthly &amp; of the grosser partes, for which cause, although we trie and finde out sundry properties of it or that this hath, yet doth it but little possesse of the selfe same vertues, which the auncient ascribe to their proper glasse. And this is named the glasse of the Philosophers, although (in very déede) it be no glasse but rather a certaine naturall Sugar, and that swéete, &amp; cleare or to be séene through like Christall, and colde, as the yse, coniea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

Neuerthelesse I applyed to the foreheade, a linnen clothe wet in the water of Roses, Lettuce, the oyle of Roses, &amp; vineger, which I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded a good whyles before to be done, but they had neglected it.

But the nexte day after he sayde and complayned, that hys heade marueylously grieued hym. <hi>Gesnerus</hi> also gaue to a dropsye person, sixe graynes of the <hi>Stibium</hi> prepared, darcke and fumyng a lyttle, which after was grieuously vexed about the hearte, the payne contynewing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nexte morrowe, and he purged vpward, and downeward, but little in quantitie.</p>
               <p>A certaine notable, &amp; singuler preparer of the <hi>Antimonie</hi> wrote vnto <hi>Gesnerus,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had giue, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to foure hundreth persons of euery kind and age, this his <hi>Antimonie,</hi> not only without any harme, but with prosperous successe.

mindeth to receiue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Antimonie,</hi> may neither before, nor after the taking of it, blede by vaine. Of this his <hi>Antimonie</hi> he sent certaine partes, being of thrée sundry colours, differing one from the other, of which the same, that was of a red colour, be preferred before the others, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same tarried a longer time in the fire, that it might attaine the colour, and so the vertue breathed forth. But for that it is a deeper red to fire, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cause must a greater dose or quantitie be ministred. The same person gaue of the red <hi>Antimonie,</hi> to a certaine man strong of body, fiue graines, but to such which were meane of strength, and to women, he ministred only fowre graines. And to the persons weake of body, only thrée graines. But if any shalbe of a mightie strong complexion, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him may sixe graines be safely applyed, but he thinketh not good to minister aboue this dose, where necessitie requireth, it may be ministred at any time of the day, yea at midnight if neede shalbe, so that it be receaued fiue or sixe howres after meate, &amp; before or rather after the taking, to fast two or thrée howres. But where necessitie doth not so vrge or require, the aptest time in giuing of it, shalbe in the morning, an howre before the sunne rising. I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister (saith he) this <hi>Antimonie</hi> against al Agues, the dropsie, the Iaundise, the bloody scouring, the Melancholy of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, rewmes the paines of the head, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> french disease singularly, a costiue belly, the flewme &amp; fulnesse of the breast &amp; stomacke, a stincking breath procéeding of the corruption of the stomacke, poysons, fransynesse &amp; many other diseases, these hetherto be his. Against the falling sicknesse, take of the pouder of <hi>Antimonie,</hi> of Dragons blood, of Castorie, of each two drams, these brought to pouder and mixed, minister after Arte, this also put vnder the tongue of a chylde, if néede requireth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gesnerus</hi> also hath thus noted, by the iudgement and opinion of others, of the maner of vsing of the same. The dose of <hi>Stimmeos</hi> or <hi>Stibium</hi> to be prepared &amp; giuen to the strong persons, must be in waight either fiue or sixe graines, but to persons weake of strenght, only thrée or foure graines, mixed with Sugar Roset, or Violets. To childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being foure, fiue, or sixe yéeres olde, giue but one graine waight &amp; a halfe, in the <hi>Rob</hi> or syrupe of Walwooort or elder flowers. To slender old women, one graine, with milke. For this worketh within an howre, or halfe an howre, after the

taking. This also may be ministred (as some report) to wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Chyld, without peryll or harme (which I marueylously doubt.)</p>
               <p>They which mynd to receiue the <hi>Antimonie</hi> prepared, let them take it with a fasting stomack, not eating any meat after, for seuen or eyght howers: but within a whyles after the taking, let the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son drincke a lytle quantity warme, of the broth of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another maner out of Sulphure vyue, which a certayne Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vttered to the Aucthour: fyrst the brymstone ought to be a lytle calcyned, but warely that it be not burned, or set on fyre, in such maner that it may almost be brought into powder.

But he affyrmed, that hard it is, to prepare this oyle: nor that he could well discribe the maner of the same, but that a present sight in the doing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requyred. Vnto <hi>D.

               <p>Agayne vnto <hi>D. Gesnerus,</hi> wrote an old friend, and learned man, thus of the oyle of brymstone. Let the brymstone not yet tryed on the fyre, be kyndled in an earthen pan, and on the pan standing on a Treuet, hang a head, as some name it, or a Bell (being of glasse) and pargeted with lute: that it may receyue the fume of the brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, which within it is thyckned into an oyle, and by the pype or Nose of the Bell stylleth forth into a Receauer standing vnder, which so gathereth the oyle distylling.</p>

Nor am I ignoraunt (sayth he) how neere vnto the perfection of these, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations agree, as that the pure &amp; hurtfull, may be seperated from the vnpure &amp; vnhurtful, the subtill and penetrable, from the grosse and immouable. For in what manner soeuer any matter, may be made subtiller, clearer &amp; more penetrating, of these, doth it declare the greater vertues in action. In that the Feces of the simple ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hinder the actions. And for that cause doe the auncient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, make mention of the reduction vnto the first matter, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which when it shall come, the matter attaineth an extreeme sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilnesse, and the greatest also it yeeldeth in the practiue worke. So that you neede not to deubt, but such an oyle of Vitrioll, which shal attaine the extreeme subtilnesse in preparation, may in his actions to come, be not onely most perfite, but also nothing at all hurtfull, by which reason, if the practysioners in the preparations, shalbe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther negligenter or slacker, through this may it be caused the more venimous, to the taking within the body. For how much the lesser the practysioner may erre or doth erre in the preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the same, or howe the oyle may be made perfitter, these three hereafter are diligently to be considered before all others. First, what maner of Vitrioll must or ought to be chosen, then how the same may be boyled, and what manner of calcination vsed. For it séemeth, that the same rule or order, which was afore vttred and taught in the preparation of <hi>Antimonie,</hi> may like be applied in the oyle of vitrioll. And the <hi>Antimonie</hi> (as they say) except it be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently chosen, and very well calcyned after art, they in no wyse graunt, that the same rightly and without daunger may be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, for which cause they will it carefully to be prepared, that the venimous qualitie may so be auoyded.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3208:214"/>
But the earth of the vitriol calcined, ought a fore to be wel brought to powder, &amp; the water then powred vpon it. With this oyle, and vermylon, make as you knowe, vnto the coniealing of <hi>Mercurie.</hi> This first borrowed out of an olde Alchymy booke written.</p>
               <p>Another maner: that you may make the oyle of vitryoll, take of Romayne vitryoll finely brought to powder, twentye poundes, which dissolue by lytle and litle on coales in a pot or panne not gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and after the vitryoll shall be molten, suffer it after so long to boyle, vntyll it be well dryed. Which done, let it be diligently brought to powder, and powred into an other vessel not glased, but well and close couered, that no fylth nor dust fall into it. After this a cleare and vehement fyre of coales made, aboue &amp; beneath it, that the vitryoll may become so redde as Vermylon: of this vitryoll brought and made so redde, take twelue poundes, which powre into a Retorte verye well luted: with his Receauer, lyke luted in the ioynt: and the fyrst day begynne with a soft fyre, but the seconde daye with a stronger fyre of coales onely, and the thyrde day, with a most strong fyre made of wood, shall you distyl the oyle of vitryol. It is here to be noted, that you must powre in a lytle <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua vitae</hi> into the Receauer, that the spyrites of the vitryoll may be retayned in it. And after the distyllacion ended, the same ought to be euaporated forth, the Receauer being set on coales, for on such wyse is the styncking vapour eleuated, and when no more vapour shall appeare, or greeuously stincketh, then shall the oyle be left and remayne pure. The propertyes of this oyle, be in a maner innumerable. With the water of <hi>Tamaricis,</hi> it auayleth against the passions of the Splene.

And this conceyue, that when the Cucurbyte is in a manner redde hote, then the Dystillation to be ended: so that then you maye withdrawe the fire, and let them stande all a night without fire, that they maye coole by themselues.

               <p>That if you will trye, whether the Quintessence be pure, or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaited, wette a napkin or lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloth in the sayde lyquour, and putting a candell to it, set on fire, if incontinent it flameth, and the cloth neuer the worse, then is it most effectuous and perfite. And handkerchiefes wette in this water, being kyndled, flame, and not consume them, for the flame so lightly burneth on the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloth, that it pierceth or entreth not through, but as it were, by a licking maner, suppeth vp the lycour agréeable to it, and of a firie nature: That if you poure a little of it in the palme of the hande, and set it on fire with the flame of paper, it then burneth in the palme, and not heateth nor burneth the hande.</p>
               <p>I haue tryed the marueylous vertue of it (sayeth <hi>Lemnius</hi>) in many matters, for at what time the ayre is very colde, and that it strongly fréeseth, this lycour for all that is not frosen, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed to yse, insomuch the ynke at that season, and many others

besides, myxed with certaine droppes of it, are defended from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frosen, and the same procéedeth through the extréeme hote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and thynnesse, which consist in it: this burning wyne myx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with salt, and set on fire, causeth the standers about, whyles it flameth, to appeare lyke deade persons. Hitherto <hi>Ringelbergius.</hi> This séetheth an egge, and preserueth boyled or rawe fleshe from putrifying, being dipped in the same: and troubled wyne myxed with it, cléereth, and is restored: and dropped into newe wyne, doth lyke cleare it: Wyne decaying and sower, it also restoreth: It draweth forth the vertue of all herbes, if they be infused in it, except the sauour of the Violet, which it retayneth not: The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of it slayeth all venymous wormes, and auoydeth poyson. This <hi>Vitalis.</hi> And this one thing is marueylous, which I learned (sayth the Author) of a credible person: that if certaine droppes of the water be poured into a gunne, and myxed with the pouder at the shooting of, this htetsarb: In the same maner are also great rockes of stone broken: and I heare (sayth the Authour) a beaten way so made by the valley <hi>Tellina,</hi> (as I gesse) toward Millaine: By the dropping of the water on the rockes, made of wyne thrice dystilled ouer, which by that meanes are woonderfullye cracked and broken a sunder. Further a lynnen clothe dypped in it (as we haue aboue vttered) doth wholye flame, without harme of the threades: and dystilled a fourth time ouer, if you then throwe of it vp into the ayre, nothing of it will discende or fall to the earth: And if you will a fishe to haue a better sauour with it, kill the fishe then in this dystilled licour, and suffer the same to lye in it a time, and it wil continue in the like sauour for many days: if you season the fishe killed in this maner, with Salt and Pepper, there will nothing eate pleasanter, especially if it shall be a fishe of the best kinde. The burning water often distilled, if with it you shall wash the hands, and set on flame, they will burne without harme.

drie roote, as the roote of <hi>Petasitis,</hi> the same brought to fine pouder, &amp; put into a Cucurbite, poure vpon a sufficient quantitie of wyne: the Cucurbite dilligentlie luted, set into <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and let the wyne be drawne forth.

               <p>Another maner of drawing foorth, verye singular, of an vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Aucthour: Take your Quintessence, in which infuse your proper simple, or compound for fouretéene houres, grosely brought to pouder, and set rather in a colde place, then hote to infuse: and the proper Quintessence shall drawe to it, the fixed spirit of your matter, and be lyke in propertie to it: and when you shall see the Quintessence coloured, of the matter infused, seperate then the same artificiallie by an instrument, which dylligentlye kéepe in a Glasse, close stopped with waxe.</p>

               <p>A most singular, and the profitablest manner of drawing iuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of hearbes. Take gréene Sage, and drawe a water out of the same by distyllation: or let the dryed Sage be taken, on which powre the water, that from it the subtyller parte maye be seperated, but the grosser Sauge infused, stiepe for certayne dayes, whiche after distyll according to Arte. In this distylled water, stiepe againe the dryed Sauge, in suche manner, that the water maye couer the Sauge, well two or thrée fyngers aboue: and let the whole stande close stopped in a Iugge or potte, that it maye breathe verye lyttle out, in water temperatelye hote. After let the Sauge be pressed foorth, and the Sauge lyke dryed, as above vttered, stiepe againe in this water, and the same repeate thrée or fowre tymes. Which done, let the water be seperated, which vnto another drawing maye aptlye serue, or vnto other vses.

               <p>

               <p>Another maner of drawing the Saltes out of hearbes, or rootes, or any other matter, written in the <hi>Germaine</hi> tongue. The hearbs or rootes prepared vnto this vse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought afore to be dryed, then bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a potte vnto an ashie whitenesse.

               </p>
               <p>Whether the Ashes may be boyled, as of the wormewood, with the water of the same symple distylled, or with the iuyce of the hearbe puryfied &amp; Fyltred: or the same hearbe dryed, which after the infusing boyle togyther a whiles, then straine the whole, for on

               <p>THE confection of Borace vsed at Venice, a singular secrete: Take of Cowes mylke distylled two pyntes, of clarified Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye foure ounces, of Saffron three drams, or Salt nyter well pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (that is, pure and somewhat sweete, hauing no sharpnes nor tartenes at all) fowre poundes. Let all these be incorporated with the mylke (that is dyssolued at the fyre) with three pyntes of the water of the strong myxture drayned, through the strongest and best ashes, and myxed stronglie togyther. After poure the whole into a potte glased, which set in a colde (and moyst) place, for one moneth. The stone after found in the bottome, let it be cleansed agayne, and purifyed after this manner: Take of the sayd stone one pounde, of symple water dystylled foure pyntes, the whole dyssolue togyther at the fyre, and purge or skymme the froth of verie cleane, and when no more some or froth shall aryse, euapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the whole water (that is, caste or poure the same forth, when it shall be through colde) and you shall possesse a most pure and fine Borace.</p>
               <p>A syngular forme and way, in making of the Borace, borrowed out of a Frenche booke written: Take newe Butter of one mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes makyng, or there about, salted, which dylligentlye washe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tymes in cleare water. Of this Butter washed, take one pounde, of the oyle of Tartare thrée pyntes, these after the myxing in the Sunne, poure into an earthen platter or pan glased: which stronglie sturre and labour togyther with a large spatle.

And this may aptly be prepared and made, in the monethes of Iune, Iulie, and August.</p>
               <p>A syngular way of making Borace, that at this daye is in vse with the Goldsmythes, which was brought out of <hi>Alexandria</hi> vnto the Aucthour, and out of an <hi>Italian</hi> booke by him, &amp; into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn turned. Take of Goates mylke distylled, and poured, into a Glasse bodie, adde to it of roche Alome brought to pouder, that it may easily be dissolued without fire in the water of the mylk. The whole poured into a narrow necked Glasse, let the water be well two fingers breadth aboue the Alome, which close couered, let so stand for fiue or sixe weekes, or vntyll the Alome appeareth a part, which from the water must be seperated or taken, and put into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Glasse. Which thus ordered, take two poundes of Oyle of sweete Almondes, and fowre poundes of the marrow of an Oxe or Cowe: the marrow with the Oyle mixe so togyther, that it maye melt and be dissolued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which after straine through a Linnen cloth, &amp; you shall obtaine a thicke Oyle. To this Oile adde the abouesayd Alome, in such maner, that the Oyle couereth two fingers breadth aboue the Alome, the same then set in the Sunne for three mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, or a longer tyme, which is the better: and on such wyse shall you prepare, and make what quantitie of Boraxe you wyll: and this conceaue, to be a most excellent secrete.

the skimme kéepe a part in a vessel, for in it is an Oyle contained, which kyndled burneth lyke a Candle. That you may rightlye iudge and know of the perfite boyling of the same: instyll certayne droppes of it on a marble stone, or on your nayle, and if it remaine coniealed, it is then sufficient.</p>
               <p>Another perfit way, borowed out of a Goldsmithes booke, of fame with vs: Take of Alome one pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which breake in a grosse maner, to it adde of pure &amp; cléere Gum Arabicke one quarter of a pound, verie fyne brought to pouder, of the séedes or corne of Wheate and Barlye, of each one quarter and a halfe, the seedes of the Wheate &amp; Barlie powre into an earthen vessel glased within, which couer with warme Cowe mylke, after set these into whote Horse doong for fiue and fiftye dayes, and at euerie seuen dayes ende, renue it with newe whote doong.</p>

               <p>THE auncient Philosophers in tymes past, had diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the dyssoluing of Golde, and yet vnto this day, the same not of the learned fullye vttered, whether so pure and perfyte substaunce, as the Golde is, may be purchased by mans industrye with any Arte, force, and propertie of fire, to be resolued into a perfyter and purer lycour.

For neyther an Oyle, nor water is purchased, except it be reduced into a spirit, and the substaunce of the same perfitly mixt dissolued. The same whether it may be compassed and done, I beseeche you to reuolue and ponder, according to your learned and Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vnderstanding. Yet may Golde be dyssolued, and into verie small partes, in so much that with the lycour in the distyllation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they name it, it may ascende: Notwithstanding, certaine it is, that the substaunce of Golde doth remayne.

               <p>A most noble maner of potable Golde, verye rare and secrete. First let an Orrenge be made hollowe, in taking forth the pulpe and seedes, into which put leaues of Golde, not dryuen vnto the vttermost thynnesse, so much as shall seeme needefull. Then the iuyce of the Orrenge or Lemmon pressed forth, and powred to the Golde leaues, let the Apple be close couered with his cappe or ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, &amp; set in a hote place, or by a Furnace, for fiue or eyght dayes. In this maner doe they affirme the Golde to be brought into an Oyle.

And the iudgement of the perfection of the oyle, is learned after this maner: let a lytle of the Oyle be annoynted on a piece of fleshe, which if it gylde not the same, but pierceth vnto the déepe partes of it, so that no shewe of Golde any where appeareth, then is the distyllacion and working cunninglye handled.
