            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Heere is a sound I neuer was so scar'd,</l>
               <l>Ile seeke it out; it comes from yonder way:</l>
               <l>Some Monster or some Deuill makes this noyse,</l>
               <l>For on my life it is no humane voyce.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So forth he rides, and vnderneath a Hill</l>
               <l>He findes a Dragon, with a Lyon met:</l>
               <l>Braue sport (said he) I pra'y fight out your fill,</l>
               <l>And then vpon the strongest I will set,</l>
               <l>Which of the twaine that first aside doth start:</l>

               <l>The Dragon windes his crooked knotted tayle,</l>
               <l>About the Lyons legs to cast him so:</l>
               <l>The Lyon fastens on his rugged scale,</l>
               <l>And nimbly doth auoyde that ouerthrow.</l>

               <l>At last, the Lyon faintly turnes aside,</l>
               <l>And lookes about, as if hee would be gone:</l>
               <l>Nay then (quoth <hi>Guy</hi>) Dragon haue at your hide,</l>
               <l>Defend your Deuils face, Ile lay it on.</l>
               <l>With that couragiously to worke he goes,</l>
               <l>And deales the Dragon very manly blowes.</l>

               <l>Whose very lookes might make a man affray'd,</l>
               <l>So terrible seemed his deuouring jawes.</l>
               <l>Wide gaping, grisly, like the mouth of Hell:</l>
               <l>More horrible then Pen, or Tongue can tell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His blazing eyes did burne like liuing fire,</l>
               <l>And forth his smoaking gorge came sulpher smoke,</l>
               <l>Aloft his speckled brest, hee lifted hyer</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Guy</hi> could reach at length of weapons stroke.</l>
               <l>Thus in most irefull moode himselfe he bore,</l>

               <l>With that, his mortall sting he stretched out,</l>
               <l>Exceeding farre the sharpest point of Steele,</l>
               <l>Then turnes and windes his scaly tayle about</l>
               <l>The Horses legs, more nimbly then an Eele,</l>
               <l>With that, <hi>Guy</hi> hewes vpon him with his blade,</l>
               <l>And three mens strength to euery stroke he layde.</l>

               <l>One fatall blowe he gaue him in the side,</l>

               <l>The Sword had made a passage large and wide,</l>
               <l>That deepe into the Monsters gore <hi>Guy</hi> stood:</l>
               <l>Then with a second wound he ouertooke him,</l>

               <l>Nay then (quoth he) thou hast not long to liue,</l>
               <l>I see thou faintest, at the point to fall,</l>
               <l>Then such a stroake of death he did him giue,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Away hee rides, and lets that Hell-hound lye,</l>

               <l>He came to him, and like a Dog did fawne.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
