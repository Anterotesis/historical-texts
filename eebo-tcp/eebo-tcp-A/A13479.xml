            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Twixt Poetry and best Diuinity</l>

            <l>Why may not then an Englishman. I pray,</l>
            <l>In his owne language write as erst did they,</l>

            <l>And for inuention, fiction, method, measure,</l>
            <l>From them must Poets seeke to seeke that treasure.</l>
            <l>But yet I thinke a man may vse that tongue</l>
            <l>His Country vses, and doe them no wrong.</l>
            <l>Then I whose Artlesse studies are but weake,</l>

            <l>Do heere maintaine, if words be rightly plac'd,</l>
            <l>A Poets skill, with no tongue more is grac'd.</l>

            <l>From it such heauenly harmony doth grow,</l>

            <l>With admiration, to expresse their loues.</l>
            <l>No Musicke vnder heauen is more diuine,</l>
            <l>Then is a well-writte, and a well-read line.</l>
            <l>But when a witlesse selfe conceited Rooke,</l>
            <l>A good inuention dares to ouerlooke:</l>
            <l>How pitteous then mans best of wit is martyr'd,</l>

            <l>Then this detracting dutty dunghill drudge,</l>
            <l>Although he vnderstand not, yet will iudge.</l>
            <l>Thus famous Poesie must abide the doome</l>
            <l>Of euery muddy minded raskall Groome.</l>
            <l>Thus rarest Artists are continuall stung</l>
            <l>By euery prating, stinking lumpe of dung.</l>
            <l>For what cause then should I so much repine,</l>
            <l>When best of writers that ere wrote a line</l>
            <l>Are subiect to the censure of the worst,</l>
            <l>Who will their follies vent, or else they burst.</l>
            <l>I haue at idle times some Pamphlets writ,</l>
            <l>(The fruitlesse issue of a nat'rall witte)</l>
            <l>And cause I am no Scholler, some enuy me,</l>
            <l>With foule and false calumnious words belie me:</l>

            <l>Affirming or suspecting me a theefe:</l>
            <l>And that my sterrile Muse so drie is milch'd,</l>
            <l>That what I write, is borrow'd, beg'd, or filch,d.</l>
            <l>Because my name is <hi>Tailor,</hi> they suppose</l>
            <l>My best inuentions all from stealing growes:</l>
            <l>As though there were no difference to be made</l>
            <l>Betwixt the name of <hi>Tailor,</hi> and the Trade.</l>
            <l>Of all strange weapons, I haue least of skill</l>
            <l>To mannage or to wield a Tailors bill.</l>
            <l>I cannot Item it for silke and facing,</l>
            <l>For cutting, edging, stiffning, and for lacing:</l>
            <l>For bumbast, stitching, binding, and for buckram,</l>
            <l>For cotton, baies, for canuas and for lockram.</l>
            <l>All these I know, but know not how to vse them,</l>
            <l>Let trading Taylors therefore still abuse them.</l>
            <l>My skil's as good to write, to sweat, or row,</l>
            <l>As any Tailors is to steale or sowe.</l>
            <l>In ende, my pulsiue braine no Art affoords,</l>
            <l>To mint, or stampe, or forge new coined words.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:18824:12"/>But all my tongue can speake, or pen can write</l>
            <l>Was spoke and writ before I could endite.</l>
            <l>Yet let me be of my best hopes bereft,</l>
            <l>If what I euer writ I got by thest:</l>
            <l>Or by base symony, or bribes, or guifts</l>
            <l>Or begd, or borrowd it by sharking shifts.</l>
            <l>I know I neuer any thing haue done,</l>

            <l>Giue me the man whose wit will vndertake</l>

            <l>That solid matter from his braine can squees,</l>

            <l>So did the hare that plaid vpon the tabor.</l>
            <l>Shall man, I pray, so witlesse be besotted?</l>
            <l>Shall men (like beasts) no wisdome be allotted,</l>
            <l>(Without great studie) with instinct of Nature,</l>

            <l>I haue a little wit, and braine, and spleane,</l>

            <l>My wit should be so Cripled with the Gout,</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:18824:13"/>That it must haue assistance to compile,</l>

            <l>I hate such belladmongring riming slaues,</l>

            </l>
            <l>Purloining, line by line, and peece by peece,</l>
            <l>And from each place they read, will filch a fleece.</l>
            <l>Me thinks my <hi>Muse</hi> should peecemeale teare these roages</l>
            <l>More base and vile then tatter'd Irish broages.</l>
            <l>Clawkissing raskals, flattering Parasites,</l>

            <l>Tis you dambde curres haue murderd liberall minds,</l>
            <l>And made best Poets worse esteem'd then hindes.</l>
            <l>But wherefore doe I take a Schollers part,</l>
            <l>That haue no grounds or Axioms of Art:</l>
            <l>That am in Poesie an artlesse creature,</l>
            <l>That haue no learning but the booke of Nature:</l>
            <l>No Academicall Poetike straines,</l>
            <l>But homespunne medley of my mottley braines.</l>
            <l>The reason I a Schollers wants bewaile,</l>
            <l>And why against base litter'd whelps I raile,</l>
            <l>Is this, that they long time should time bestow</l>
            <l>In painefull study, secret Arts to know,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:18824:13"/>And after liue in want, contempt and scorne,</l>
            <l>By euery dunghill peasant ouerborne.</l>
            <l>Abus'd, rejected, doggedly disgrac'd,</l>
            <l>Despised ragged, lowsie, and out fac'd:</l>
            <l>Whilest Bagpipe-poets stuf with others winde,</l>
            <l>Are grac'd for wit, they haue from them purloinde.</l>
            <l>Now in mine owne defence once more Ile say,</l>
            <l>Their too rash iudgements to much runnes astray,</l>
            <l>That, cause my name is <hi>Tailor</hi> I doe theeue it,</l>
            <l>I hope their wisdomes will no more beleeue it.</l>
            <l>Nor let my want of learning be the cause,</l>
            <l>I should be bitten with blacke enuies iawes:</l>
            <l>For whosoere by nature is not a Poet</l>
            <l>By rules of Art he neuer well can show it.</l>
            <l>Ther'is many a wealthy heire long time at Schoole,</l>
            <l>Doth spend much study, and comes home a foole.</l>
            <l>A Poet needes must be a Poet borne,</l>
            <l>Or else his Art procures his greater scorne.</l>
            <l>For why? if Art alone made men excell,</l>
            <l>Me thinkes <hi>Tom Coriat</hi> should write exlent well:</l>
            <l>But he was borne be like in some crosse yeere,</l>
            <l>When learning was good cheape, but wit was deare.</l>
            <l>Then to conclude, as I before began,</l>
            <l>Though nought by Schollership or Art I can</l>
            <l>Yet (if my stocke by nature were more bare)</l>
            <l>I scorne to vtter stolne or borrowed ware:</l>
            <l>And therefore Reader now I tell thee plaine,</l>
            <l>If thou incredilous dost still remaine.</l>
            <l>If yea or nay these reasons doe perswade thee,</l>

            <l>WHen I but think, the daies we wander in,</l>
            <l>How most part of the world do liue by sinne:</l>
            <l>How finely Sathan shewed his cunning skill,</l>
            <l>That one man gets his goods, from others ill.</l>
            <l>Doth not the Lawiers liue like mighty Lords,</l>
            <l>On braules, on iarres, contentions and discords,</l>
            <l>When if men (as they should) would but agree,</l>
            <l>A Tearme would scarcely yeeld a Lawyers fee?</l>
            <l>Let vsurers bragge of conscience what they can,</l>
            <l>They liue like deuils, vpon the bane of man:</l>
            <l>The racking land-lord gets his ill got store,</l>
            <l>By rayling rents, which make his tennants poore:</l>
            <l>Clap shoulder serieants get the deuill and all</l>
            <l>By begg'ring and by bringing men in thrall.</l>
            <l>Like gentlemen, the Iaylors spend their liues</l>
            <l>By keeping men in fetters, bonds and gyues:</l>
            <l>The vintner and the vict'lar get most gaines</l>
            <l>From dayly drunkards, and distemperd braines:</l>
            <l>From whence do Iustice Clerks get most they haue,</l>
            <l>But from the whore, the theife, the bawd, the knaue?</l>
            <l>In what consists the hangmans greatest hope</l>
            <l>But hope of great imployment for the rope?</l>
            <l>The very blew-coate beadles get their trash,</l>
            <l>By whips and rods, and the fine firking lash.</l>
            <l>But leauing these, note but how Corporations</l>
            <l>From others vices, get their reputations:</l>
            <l>The vpstart veluet silken fatten gull,</l>
            <l>His owne purse empts to fill the Mercers full:</l>
            <l>When for his birth, or wit more fit agrees,</l>
            <l>A breech of leather, and a coate of freese.</l>
            <l>The Taylor is a gentleman transform'd</l>
            <l>For his inuenting fashions new deform'd,</l>
            <l>And those that make the Verdingales and bodies,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:18824:20"/>Get most the haue from idle witlesse nodies.</l>
            <l>The Tires, the Periwigs, and the Rebatoes,</l>
            <l>Are made t'adorne Ilshap'd Inamoratoes.</l>
            <l>Yea all the world is falne to such a madnesse,</l>
            <l>That each man gets his goods from others badnesse.</l>
            <l>The Chirurgian and Phisitian get their stockes,</l>
            <l>From Goutes, from Feauers, Botches, Piles, and Pockes:</l>
            <l>With others paine, they most of all are pleas'd,</l>
            <l>And best are eas'd: when others are diseas'd.</l>
            <l>As Sextons liue by deade, and not by quicke,</l>
            <l>So they liue with the sound, but by the sicke.</l>

            <l>Th'encrease of which is to be seldome found.</l>

            <l>But who so much in this vile life are hated,</l>

            <l>O hang him rascall, he's a Puritan.</l>
            <l>And sure I thinke the Deuill by that false name</l>
            <l>Hath added thousands soules vnto his flame.</l>
            <l>Some man ere he'le be cal'd a Puritan</l>

            <l>A Libertine, Papist, or else what not,</l>
            <l>To keepe his name from so impure a blot.</l>
            <l>I speake not this regarding their estate,</l>

            <l>For good indifferent Ceremonius rites,</l>

            <l>Nor doe I praise the louing Sisters loue,</l>

            <l>To dresse their meate the Sabbath day or no.</l>
            <l>And wherefore now the Churchmen of these daies,</l>
            <l>Ride too and fro, to preach so many waies,</l>
            <l>When Christ to his Apostles gaue in charge</l>
            <l>That they should seeke and teach all nations large,</l>
            <l>The way, that in his Lawes they might abide,</l>

            <l>These Idle questionists, these scismatickes,</l>
            <l>I hold no better then ranke heretikes:</l>
            <l>But this I thinke not well, when honest hearts</l>

            <l>How then can my comparing be gainstood,</l>

            <l>There is one thing more I had almost forgot,</l>

            <l>Or in no place of Iustice be instalde:</l>
            <l>The reason is they gaine by mens excesse</l>
            <l>Of deuilish quafting and damb'd drunkennesse.</l>
            <l>For why, should men be moderate in their drinke.</l>
            <l>Much Beere, and bottle Ale should stand and stinke:</l>
            <l>And Mounseir Claret, and sweet Signeor Sacke</l>
            <l>Would sowre and turne vnto the Merchants wracke?</l>
            <l>The Vintners then within their sellers deepe</l>
            <l>Such coniuring at midnight would not keepe.</l>
            <l>This swinish sinne hath man of sense bereauen,</l>
            <l>To bandy balles of blasphemy gainst heauen.</l>
            <l>It is the way, the dore, the porch, the gate,</l>
            <l>All other vices enter in thereat.</l>
            <l>A drunken man in rage will stab his brother,</l>
            <l>He'le Cuckold his owne father, whoore his mother,</l>
            <l>Reuile and curse, sweare, and speake dangerous treason,</l>
            <l>And when he's sober, hangs for't by the weason.</l>
            <l>How then should men a reformation giue,</l>
            <l>To mend those crimes, that by those Crimes doe liue.</l>
            <l>The Patriarke <hi>Noah</hi> first did plant the Vine,</l>
            <l>And first did feele the powerfull force of wine.</l>
            <l>And righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> by wine depriu'd of wit,</l>
            <l>Foule Incest with his daughter did commit.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Holophernes</hi> drunken lay in bed</l>

            <l>And being drunke, his best friend <hi>Clitus</hi> slew.</l>
            <l>If euery haire vpon the heads of men</l>
            <l>Were quils, and euery quill were made a pen:</l>
            <l>Were Earth to paper turn'd; and Seas to Inke</l>
            <l>And all the world were writers, yet I thinke,</l>
            <l>They could not write the mischifes done by drinke.</l>
            <l>And such a custome men hath tane therein,</l>
            <l>That to be drunke, is scarse accounted sinne,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:18824:42"/>But houest recreariue meriment</l>
            <l>The time is term'd that is in tipling spent.</l>
            <l>A Marchants ship is richly fraught, ariues</l>
            <l>And for thanksgiuing that so wel he thriues,</l>
            <l>He makes a feast, and store of money spends,</l>
            <l>Inuites his kinsfolke, creditors, and friends:</l>
            <l>Where stormes, and Rocks, and Pirates, are forgot,</l>
            <l>And triumphes made to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and the Pot.</l>
            <l>A Rich mans wife's deliuered of a boy,</l>
            <l>And all the houshold must be drunk for ioy.</l>
            <l>The prisoner that's condemn'd to die and hang,</l>
            <l>And by reprieue hath scap'd that bitter pang,</l>
            <l>Will presently his old acquaintance call,</l>
            <l>And ere he giues God thankes to drinking fall.</l>
            <l>Why drunkards common are, as lies, or stealing,</l>
            <l>And sober men are scarce, like honest dealing.</l>
            <l>When men doe meet, the second word that's spoke,</l>
            <l>Is where's good liquour, and a pipe of smoake.</l>
            <l>The labouring man that for his hire doth serue,</l>
            <l>Let Landlord tarry, wife and children sterue</l>
            <l>With not a bit of bread within the house,</l>
            <l>Yet he'le sit on the Alebench and carows.</l>
            <l>Thus like an Inundation drinke doth drowne</l>
            <l>The Rich, the Poore, the Courtier, and the Clowne.</l>
            <l>Since then to be a drunkard, is to be</l>
            <l>The sincke of Incest, and Sodomitry,</l>
            <l>Of Treason, swearing, fighting, beg'ry, murder,</l>
            <l>And diuers more, I then will goe no furder:</l>
            <l>But heere my Satyrs stinging whip ile waste</l>
            <l>In lashing dropsie drunkards out of taste.</l>
            <l>How then can it be possible that such</l>
            <l>Who sell Wine, Beere, or Ale, doe gaine so much,</l>
            <l>Should punish drunkards, as the Law commands,</l>
            <l>In whose vaine spending, their most gaining stands.</l>
            <l>It were all one as if a Mercer did</l>
            <l>To weare Silke, Veluet, Cloth of Gold forbid.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:18824:42"/>And Victlers may as wisely punish those</l>
            <l>From whom their daily drinks, great gettings growes.</l>
            <l>I would haue all old drunkards to consent</l>
            <l>To put a Bill vp to the Parlament:</l>
            <l>That those by quaffing that haue spent their wealth,</l>
            <l>Consum'd their times, their memory, their health,</l>
            <l>And by excessiue spending now are bare,</l>
            <l>That Merchants, Brewers, Vintners, should prepare</l>
            <l>Some Hospitals to keepe them in their age,</l>
            <l>And cloath, and feed them, from fierce famines rage,</l>
            <l>For euery one whose hard vnlucky lots,</l>
            <l>Hath beene to be vndone by empting pots,</l>
            <l>I hold it fit that those the pots that filde,</l>
            <l>Should contribute those Almeshouses to builde.</l>
            <l>Yet one obiection would this bill debarre,</l>
            <l>Too many drunkards there already are;</l>
            <l>And rather then this law would bate their store,</l>
            <l>I feare'twould make them twise as many more.</l>
            <l>For why, to drinke most men would be too bold,</l>
            <l>Because they would haue pentions being old.</l>
            <l>And men (of purpose to this vice would fall,</l>
            <l>To be true beads-men to this hospitall.</l>
            <l>Then let it be as it already is,</l>
            <l>But yet I hold it not to be amisse)</l>
            <l>Those Drinkesellers, from office to exclude</l>
            <l>And so for that my <hi>Satyr</hi> doth conclude.</l>
            <l>I could rippe vp a Catologue of things,</l>
            <l>Which thousand thousands to damnation flings,</l>
            <l>But all my paines at last would be but idle.</l>
            <l>It is not man, can mens Affections bridle.</l>
            <l>Sinne cannot be put downe with inke and paper,</l>

            <l>SVch imputations, and such daily wrongs</l>
            <l>Are laid on Watermen, by Enuious tongues.</l>
            <l>To cleare the which, if I should silent be</l>
            <l>T'were basenesse, and stupidity in me.</l>
            <l>Nor doe I purpose now with inke and pen,</l>
            <l>To write of them, as they are watermen,</l>
            <l>But this I speake, defending their vocation</l>
            <l>From slanders false, and idle imputation.</l>
            <l>Yet should I onely of the men but speake</l>
            <l>I could the top of Enuies Coxcombe breake.</l>
            <l>For I would haue all men to vnderstand</l>
            <l>A Waterman's a man by Sea or Land.</l>
            <l>And on the land and sea, can seruice do</l>
            <l>To serue his King, as well as other two:</l>
            <l>He'le guard his Country both on seas and shore</l>
            <l>And what (a Gods name) can a man doe more.</l>
            <l>Like double men they well can play indeed</l>

            <l>And not to be too partiall in my words,</l>
            <l>I thinke no Company more knaues affoords:</l>
            <l>And this must be the reason, because farre</l>
            <l>Aboue all Companies their numbers are:</l>
            <l>And where the multitude of men most is,</l>
            <l>By consequence there must be most amisse.</l>
            <l>And sure of honest men it hath as many,</l>
            <l>As any other Company hath any.</l>
            <l>Though not of wealth they haue super fluous store,</l>
            <l>Contents is a Kingdome, and they seeke no more.</l>
            <l>Of Mercers, Grocers, Drapers, men shall finde</l>
            <l>Men that to loose babauiour are inclinde.</l>
            <l>Of Goldsmiths, Silkemen, Clothworkers, and Skinners,</l>
            <l>When they are at the best they all are sinners.</l>
            <l>And drunken rascalles are of euery Trade,</l>
            <l>Should I name all, I or'e the bootes should wade?</l>
            <l>If Watermen be onely knaues alone,</l>
            <l>Let all that's faultlesse cast at them a stone.</l>
            <l>Some may reply to my Apology:</l>
            <l>How they in plying are vnmannerly,</l>
            <l>And one from tother, hale, and pul, and teare,</l>
            <l>And raise, and braule, and curse, and banne, and sweare.</l>
            <l>In this ile not defend them with excuses,</l>
            <l>I alwaies did, and doe hate those abuses.</l>
            <l>The honest vse, of this true trade I sing,</l>
            <l>And not the abuses that from thence doe spring.</l>
            <l>And sure no Company hath Lawes more strict,</l>
            <l>Then Watermen, which weekely they inflict</l>
            <l>Vpon offenders, who are made pay duely</l>
            <l>Their fines, or prison'd, cause they plide vnruly.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:18824:51"/>They keepe no shops, nor sell deceitfull wares,</l>
            <l>But like to Pilgrims trauell for their fares,</l>
            <l>And they must aske the question where they goe.</l>
            <l>If men will goe by water yea or no</l>
            <l>Which being spoke aright, the fault's not such,</l>
            <l>But any Tradesman (sure) will doe as much.</l>
            <l>The Mercer as ye passe along the way</l>
            <l>Will aske what d'e lacke, come neere I pray.</l>
            <l>The Draper whose warme ware doth clad the backe,</l>
            <l>Will be so bolde as aske ye what d'e lacke.</l>
            <l>The Goldsmith midst his siluer and his gold</l>
            <l>To aske you, what d'e lacke he will be bold.</l>
            <l>Through Birchin lane, who euer often goes,</l>
            <l>Saies, Watermen are honest men to those,</l>
            <l>And if your Coate be torne, before you goe,</l>
            <l>Of euery rent, with rending thei'le make two.</l>
            <l>This being granted, as none can deny,</l>
            <l>Most Trades aswell as Watermen doe plye,</l>
            <l>If in their plying they doe chance to iarre,</l>
            <l>They doe but like the Lawyers at the Barre.</l>
            <l>Who plead as if they meant by the'ares to fall,</l>
            <l>And when the Court doth rise, to friendship fall.</l>
            <l>So Watermen, that for a fare contends</l>
            <l>The fare once gone, the Watermen are friends.</l>
            <l>And this I know, and therefore dare maintaine,</l>
            <l>That he that truely labours and takes paine,</l>
            <l>May with a better Conscience sleepe in bed,</l>
            <l>Then he that is with ill got thousands sped.</l>
