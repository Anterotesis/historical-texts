         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <head>¶ Of Virginitie, and the state of single life, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the dutie of Virgins, of Maids, or single Women.</head>
                     <p>NOw concerning virgins [or the state of Uirginitie] I (saith S. Paule) haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lord: yet giue I mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise &amp; counsell, as one that hath obteined mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Lord to be faithfull [or beléeued.]</p>
                     <p>I suppose therfore, that the single life is good for the present necessitie, [in these afflictions and persecutions of the Church] I meane that it is good for a man so to be [single, or a woman to be a virgin.]</p>
                     <p>Art thou bound vnto a wife? Séeke not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Séeke not a wife: but if thou marie, and takest a wife, thou sinnest not. And if a virgin marie, she sinneth not: neuerthelesse, such shall haue trouble in the flesh, [as worldlie cares of their children and familie:] but I spare you, [in wishing that you men could liue without wiues, and you virgins without husbands.]</p>
                     <p>And this I saie, bicause the time is short: the fashion of this world goeth awaie, and I would haue you without care. For the vnmaried careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is maried, careth for the things of the world, [onelie appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to this present life] how he may please his wife.</p>
                     <p>There is difference also betwéene a virgin and a wife: the virgin, or vnmaried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holie both in bodie and in spirit: and attaine vnto it sooner than the maried wife, bicause she is without cares: but she that is maried ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for the things of the world, how she may please hir husband.</p>
                     <p>And this I speake for your owne commoditie or profit, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle you in a snare: [not to bind your conscience to single life.] For
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1693:3"/>
that were presumption:] but for comlinesse sake, that ye might folowe that which is honest, and that ye may cleaue fast vnto the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out separation.</p>
                     <p>But if anie man thinke that it is vncomlie for his virgin, if she passe the flower of hir age or time of mariage, [then] and néed so require, [that she should marie to auoid fornication] let him doo what he will, he sinneth not: let them be maried. Neuerthelesse, he that standeth firme in his hart [and is fullie persuaded] that he hath no néed: but hath power ouer his owne will, and hath so decréed in his hart, that he will kéepe his virgin, he doth well. [For the fathers will dependeth on his childrens will in this point of mariage, insomuch as he is bound to haue respect to their infirmitie: neither can he iustlie require of them single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life, if they haue not the gift of God so to liue.] So then, he that giueth his virgin to mariage doth well: but he that giueth hir not to mariage doth better [and more commodious for his children, in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them from cares.]</p>
                     <p>The wife is bound by the lawe of matrimonie, as long as hir hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band liueth: but if hir husband be dead, she is at libertie to marie with whom she will, onelie in the Lord: but she is more blessed, if she so abide, in my iudgement: and I thinke that I haue also the spirit of God. <hi>1. Cor. 7, 25,26, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>[Where note, that S. Paule doth not here prefer single life, as a thing more holie than mariage: but in respect, and by reason of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which mariage hath more than the other: neither doth hée bind mens or womens consciences to single life or widowhood, as to that which God hath left frée, and therfore it were presumption in anie other to doo it. But shewing what is most agréeable to Gods will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the circumstance of the time, place and persons, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in that the Church was now, when he wrote this, in great perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: he would insinuate hereby, that to heape one trouble or care vpon another by mariage, was not so profitable for men and women to go on towards godlinesse, as behooued, during such afflictions.]</p>
                     <p>If a virgin or maid vow a vow vnto the Lord [of virginitie,] and bind hir selfe by a bond [to liue chast,] being in hir fathers house, in the time of hir youth: &amp; hir father [hearing of this hir vow and bond, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she hath bound hir selfe] hold his peace, and doo not gaine-saie, but by silence approoue it: then all hir vowes [of virginitie] shall stand, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1693:3"/>
euerie bond wherewith she hath bound hir selfe, shall remaine of force against hir: but if hir father disalow of this hir vow and bond, the same daie that he heareth thereof, and doo not approoue or consent to the vow or bond wherewith she hath bound hir selfe: then shall not that vow or bond be of value. And the Lord will forgiue hir, bicause hir father [who hath authoritie ouer hir] disalowed hir. <hi>Numb. 30,4,5, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now therefore slaie all the males among the children, and kill all the women that haue knowne man by carnall copulation: but all the virgins, and women children that haue not knowne carnall copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, kéepe aliue for your selues to marie. [Note héere the prerogatiue of virginitie in the old lawe of armes.] <hi>Numb. 31, 16,17.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Also, when thou shalt go to war against thine enimie, and the Lord thy God shall deliuer them into thine hands, and thou shalt take them captiues, and shalt sée among the captiues a beautifull woman, and hast a desire vnto hir, &amp; wouldest take hir to thy wife: then thou shalt bring hir home to thine house, and [to signifie that hir former life must be changed, before she be ioined to the people of God] she shall shaue hir head, and pare hir nailes, and put off the garment that she was taken in, and so shall she remaine in thy house: and as she that hath renounced parents and countrie, she shall bewaile hir father and hir mother a moneth long, and after that shalt thou go in vnto hir, &amp; marie hir, and she shall be thy wife. And if thou haue no fauour vnto hir, then thou maist let hir go whither she will: but thou shalt not sell hir for monie, nor make merchandize of hir, bicause thou hast humbled hir. [Note that this onlie was permitted in the warres, otherwise the Israelites and people of God could not marie strangers.] <hi>Deut. 21, 10,11, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a man take a wife, and when he hath lien with hir, hate hir, and laie slanderous things vnto hir charge, and bring vp an euill name vpon hir, and saie: I tooke this wife, and when I came to hir, I found hir not a maid: then shall the father of the maid, and hir mother take and bring foorth the signes and tokens of the maids virginitie vnto the elders of the citie in the gate. And the damsels father shall saie vnto the elders: I gaue my daughter vnto this man to wife, and he hateth hir, and lo he laieth slanderous things vnto hir charge, saieng: I found not thy daughter a maid: and yet lo, these are the tokens of my daughters virginitie: and they shall spread the vesture or shéet before the elders. Then the elders of the citie shall take that man, and chastise him, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1693:4"/>
condemne him in an hundred sicles of siluer, and giue them vnto the father of the maid, bicause he hath brought vp an euill name vpon a maid in Israel, and bicause the shame of the fact should haue lighted vpon the father, therefore the recompense shall be made vnto him that is faultlesse: and she shall be his wife still that complained, and he may not put hir awaie all hir life time.</p>
                     <p>But if this thing be true, that the maid be not found a virgin: then they shall bring foorth the maid to the doore of hir fathers house, and the men of the citie shall stone hir with stones to death: bicause she hath wrought follie in Israel, by plaieng the whoore in hir fathers house, and loosing hir virginitie: so thou shalt put euill awaie from among you. <hi>Deut. 22, verse 15, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a maid, damsell, or virgin betrothed vnto an husband be found li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng with an other man in the towne, they both shall be stoned to death: the maid, bicause she cried not being in the citie, [where she might haue had rescue.]</p>
                     <p>But if a man find a betrothed maid in the field, and force hir, and lie with hir, then the man onelie shall die, and not the maid, bicause there is in the maid no cause of death. For as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and woundeth him to death, so is this matter. For he found hir in the fields, where though she cried, yet was there no man to resist, helpe, or succour hir against the violence and force. [Therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent can not be punished.] <hi>Deut. 22, 23, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The woman shall not weare that, which perteineth vnto the man: neither shall a man put on womans raiment. [For that were to alter the order of nature, and to despite God therefore.] All that doo so are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination vnto the Lord thy God. <hi>Deut. 22, 5.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A maid, that in hir virginitie is defiled or gotten with child in hir fathers house, or otherwise is vnshamefast, bold, licentions, and vseth much libertie, shall bring both hir selfe, and hir friends to publike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie and open reproch of all. <hi>Eccles. 42, 10,11.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A faire maid without discretion or good maners, is like a ring of gold in a swines snout. <hi>Prou. 16, 22.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Maidens, damsels, or women that are singers and dansers, are not to be harkened vnto, or kept companie withall. <hi>Eccles. 9, 4.</hi>

                        <p>WHen the Lord GOD formed all the creatures of heauen and earth, he brought them to man, that bée might giue them names: who accordinglie gaue names to euerie creature. But for Adam found hée not an helpe or mate méete for him, among all the creatures vnder heauen: therefore the Lord said: It is not good that the man should be himselfe alone, I will make an helpe or companion méet for him. So the Lord caused an heauie sléepe to fall vpon the man, and whilest he slept, he tooke one of his ribs, and closed vp the flesh in stéed thereof: and of that rib, which the Lord God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought hir to the man to be his mate or wife. [Signifieng thereby, that mankind was now perfect, when the woman was created, which before was like an vnperfect building. And as this first institution of matrimonie in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise was by God: so all lawfull mariages are now also made by the same God, and therefore to be highlie had in honour.] Then the man said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh, she shall be called woman, bicause she was taken out of man. Therefore shall man leaue his father and his mother, and shall cleaue to his wife, and they shall be one flesh. [Whereby we may sée, that mariage requireth a greater dutie of men towards their wiues, than otherwise they are bound to shew to their parents.] <hi>Gen. 2, 18, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus in the daie that God created Adam in his owne likenesse, he created them male and female, and blessed them, and called their name (Adam) in the daie that they were created. [So that the husband and the wife are now as one man, or one person, flesh or bodie. For by giuing them both one name, he noteth the inseparable coniuction of man and wife.] <hi>Gen. 5, 2.</hi>

                        <p>THE Apostle S. Paule (bicause mariage, through mans corruption, and not by Gods institution, bringeth cares and troubles to the flesh, and not so much to bind mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to single life, as to answere certaine questions of the Iewes) saith: It were good for a man not to touch a woman; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, to auoid fornication, let euerie man (in generall) haue his owne wife, and euerie woman hir owne husband.</p>
                        <p>Art thou bound vnto a wife? Séeke not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Séeke not a wife: but if thou takest a wife, thou sinnest not.</p>
                        <p>The vnmaried careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is maried, careth for the things of the world, how he may please his wife.</p>
                        <p>And hereafter they that haue wiues, shall be as though they had none. For the fashion of this world goeth awaie, &amp;c. Read more in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie. <hi>1. Cor. 7, 2, &amp;c.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Two are better than one alone. For if they fall, the one will lift vp the other: but wo vnto him that is alone. For he falleth, and there is not a companion to lift him vp. Also, if two sléepe togither, then shall they haue heate: but to one how should there be heate? And a thréefold or twofold cord is not easilie broken. [Where note by this prouerbe, how necessarie it is for a man to liue in matrimonie, and mutuall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, to the intent they may be profitable one to another, and that their things may increase: and contrariwise, how pernicious and hurtfull a thing it is be solitarie and alone, without an helper and fellowe conforter.] <hi>Eccles. 4,9,10.</hi>

Therefore as the Church is in subiection to Christ, euen so let the wiues be to their husbands in euerie thing. <hi>Ephes. 5, 22, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Wiues, submit your selues vnto your husbands, as it is comlie in the Lord. <hi>Colos. 3, 18.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let the wiues be subiect to their husbands, that euen they which obeie not the word, may without the word be won, by the conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wiues, while they behold your pure conuersation, which is with feare. Whose apparelling, let it not be outward, as with broided heare, and gold put about, or in putting on of (gorgious) apparell: but let the hid man of the hart be vncorrupt, with a méeke and quiet spirit, which is before God a thing much set by. For euen after this maner in time past did the holie women, which trusted in GOD, tire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and were subiect to their husbands. As Sara obeied Abraham, and called him Sir, or Lord. <hi>Gen. 18, 12.</hi> Whose daughters ye are, whilest you doo well, not being afraid of anie terrour, but willinglie dooing your dutie. For your condition is not the woorse for your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>1. Pet. 3, 1, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>The wiues of Bishops or Ministers also must be honest, not euill speakers, but sober, and faithfull in all things. <hi>1. Tim. 3, 11.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Teach the yoonger women to be sober minded, that they loue their husbands, that they loue their children, that they be discréet, chaste, kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at home, not running to and fro without necessarie occasions, which is a signe of lightnesse, that they be good, huswifelie, and subiect vnto their husbands, that the word of God be not euill spoken of. <hi>Tit. 2, verse 4.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will, saith S. Paule, that women araie themselues in comlie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, with shamefastnesse and modestie, not with broided heare, or gold, or pearles, or costlie apparell; wherby also curiositie, pompe, and wantonnesse is condemned, which women vse in platting, crisping, folding, or curiouslie curling their heare, or trimming their heads. But as becommeth women that professe the feare of God: so let them adorne and decke themselues with good works. <hi>1. Tim. 2, 9.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let the woman learne in silence with all subiection. For I permit not a woman to teach, neither to vsurpe authoritie ouer the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eue, and Adam was not deceiued (first,) but the woman was (first) deceiued, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the instrument of Sathan to deceiue the man, and was giltie of

the transgression. Notwithstanding, though therefore God punisheth them with subiection, and paine in their trauell: yet through bearing of children, if they continue in faith, and loue, and holinesse with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, and be faithfull and godlie in their vocation, they shall be saued. <hi>1. Tim. 2, 11.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Againe, saith S. Paule: Let your women kéepe silence in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For it is not permitted vnto them to speake: but they ought to be subiect, as also the lawe saith, <hi>Gen. 3.</hi> before. And if they will learne anie thing, let them aske their husbands at home. For it is a shame for women to speake in the Church or congregation, and a great disorder therein to suffer the woman to vsurpe that, which is peculiar to men. <hi>1. Cor. 14, 33.</hi>

And the priest shall charge hir by an oth, and saie vnto the woman: If no man haue lien with thée, neither thou hast turned to vncleannesse from thine husband, be frée from this bitter and cursed water: but if thou hast turned from thine husband, and so art defiled, and some man haue lien with thée besides thine husband; then the priest shall charge the woman with an oth of cursing, and saie: The Lord make thée to be accursed and detestable, for the oth among the people, and the Lord cause thy thigh to rot, and thy bellie to swell, and that this cursed water may go into thy bowels to cause thy bellie to swell, and thy thigh to rot (both bicause thou hast committed so heinous a fact, and forsworne thy selfe in dooing the same.) And the wife shall answer <hi>Amen, Amen:</hi> that is, be it so, as thou wishest.</p>
                     <p>After, the priest shall write these curses in a booke, and shall blot them out with the bitter water, and wash those curses, which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, into the water in the vessell, and shall cause the woman to drinke the bitter and cursed water, and the cursed water turned into bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse shall enter into hir. Then the priest shall take the gelousie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the womans hand, and shall shake the offering before the Lord, and offer it vpon the altar. And the priest shall take an handfull of the offering, for a memoriall thereof, and burne it vpon the altar, (where the incense was offered) and afterward make the woman drinke this water. So when he hath made hir drinke the water, if shée be defiled, and haue trespassed against hir husband, then shall the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed water turned into bitternesse, enter into hir, and hir bellie shall swell, and hir thigh shall rot, and the woman shall be accursed among hir peoople.

                     <p>This is the lawe of gelousie, when a wife turneth from hir husband, and is defiled, &amp;c.

                     <p>Moreouer, that women are to bée praised, and highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all, for their creation and necessarie vse we may see in the first woman, and great grandmother of all women, <hi>Eue</hi> or <hi>Heua,</hi> who as shee was the last creature that God made in Paradise: So was she not made of the verie materiall moulde of the earth, as the man Adam and other creatures were: but of a more excellent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, not of the head nor of the foot, but euen of the rib or bone taken out of the side of man, which God did to the end she should not be his Ladie, nor handmaid, but bone of the mans bones, and fleshe of his flesh, &amp; indéede most déere and néere vnto him, in equalitie of loue and friendship, and the best and most naturall helpe and comfort meets for man in all his sicknesse and infirmities: and therfore is she called woman, because she was taken out of man. For before the woman
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1693:45"/>
was created, God taking a generall viewe of all his other creatures that he had made of the earth, could not fynde one worthy enough to accompany man in humaine societie &amp; felowship: therefore God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the woman, as a very necessary helper and mate méete for man only. Yea, before the woman was created, mankinde was vnperfit and like an vnfinished building: but when shée was formed &amp; made, then the worke of mankind was fully finished &amp; made perfite for the propagation of man, &amp; his encrease vpon earth, as ye may read in the life of Heua in the 7. Lampe of Uirginitie. <hi>Gene. 1. and 2. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In woman did God first make his promise of the blessed séede to comforte man, saying. The séede of the woman shall treade downe the heade of the serpent. <hi>Gene. 3.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The woman is the glory of the man, or receiueth hir glory in commendation of man, and therefore is subiect, as the man is the Image and glory of God, or the image of Gods glory in whom his maiestie &amp; power doth shine concerning his authoritie, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man, neyther was the man created for the womans sake: but the woman for the mans sake. Therfore ought the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue power on hir head: (that is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to couer hir head as well when shee prayeth as at all other times, in signe of subiection) because of the Angels, to whom they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so shew their dissolution &amp; not only to Christ. Neuerthelesse, neyther is the man without the woman, neyther the woman without the man in the Lorde who is authour and mainteyner of their mutual coniunction. For as God made the woman of man, so nowe is man multiplyed by the woman, for as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman, but all things are of God. <hi>1. Cor. 11.7. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Doeth not nature it selfe teach you, that if a man haue long haire (as women vse to weare) it is a shame vnto him? but if a woman haue long haire, it is a prayse vnto hir: for hir long haire is giuen vnto hir of God for a couering, or to the end shee should trusse it vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout hir head, to declare that shee must couer hir head. <hi>1.

Then shortly after, shee perceiuing her selfe to be with childe, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring least for that fact shee should be stoned to death, according to Gods lawe, sent Dauid the king worde thereof secretely. Whereupon the king, partly to hyde his owne fault, and partly to saue the woman from daunger of the lawe, sent for Urias her husband to come home from warres, that hee might colour and father the matter by lying with his wife. But when Dauid sawe that Urias woulde by no meanes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with his wife Bethsabe, as he desired, he returned him back againe to Ioab with a letter, the contentes whereof caused Urias quickly to bee dispatched out of his life by the enemie. And when Bethsabe heard that her husbande Urias was dead, shee mourned for her husband: so when the mourning was done, Dauid sent for Bethsabe, and to make her amendes, hee tooke her into his house, and shee became his wife, and in the yeere of the world 3086. she brought foorth the same childe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in adulterie, being a sonne which liued not long: but being stricken by God with a sore sickenesse for Dauids &amp; Bethsabes sinnes, and punishement, it died.

                     <p>Bethsabe vnderstanding by Nathan the Prophete, that Adonia, the sonne of Aggit her mate, beganne to aspire to the kingdome of his father Dauid yet lyuing: shee (by the counsayle and aduice
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1693:69"/>
of Nathan the Prophete, who taught her, her lesson) went vnto the king her husband, and making her humble obeysaunce vnto the king as he sate in his chaumber, &amp; Abisag the Shunimite, or young virging ministring vnto him, he saide vnto her, Bethsheba, what is the matter? Shee answered, my Lorde, thou swearest by the Lorde thy God vnto thine handemaide, saying, assuredly thy sonne shall raygne after mee, and hee shall sitte vppon my throne: But beholde, now is Adoniah king, and thou my Lorde the king knowest it not, so closely is the matter kept from thee by flatterers. For hee hath offered many ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, fatte cattell and sheepe, and hath called all the kings sonnes, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biathar the priest, and Ioab the captayne of the hoste, but my sonne Salomon thy seruant hath hee not bidden. And nowe my Lorde O king, the eyes of all Israell waite on thee, that thou shouldest tel them who ought to sit on the seate of my Lorde the King after him: for else when my Lord the king shall sleepe with his fathers, I and my Sonne Salomon shalbe reputed vile, and so put to death, as wicked transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours and sinners. And lo the Queene had no sooner ended her tale, but the Prophet Nathan came and confirmed her wordes to bee true. Whereuppon the King called for Bethsabe againe (who was gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side while Nathan talked with the king) &amp; swore vnto her, to assure her that Salomon her Sonne should be that day proclaymed King, and raigne in his steade after him. Then Bethsabe the Queene hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her selfe to the grounde, did yeelde reuerence and thankes vnto the King, and desyred of GOD, that her Lord King Dauid might liue for euer.</p>
                     <p>Afterwarde when Dauid was dead, and her Sonne Salomon reigned King, and was established in his throne, it chaunced that Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah, whose purpose she preuented, came vnto her: and she suspecting him as her priuy enemy, and fearing least he would worke more trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son still against the King her sonne, demaunded first of him, whether he came peaceably and to good intent or no. And when hee answered yea, and that he had suite vnto her: then she bad him say on, for shee would heare him, and vnderstand his suite. So Adoniah made this request vnto her, that she would vouchsafe to doe so much for him, as to goe vnto the King her Sonne, and speake vnto him to giue him A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishag the shunamite to wife: for sayd he I knowe the king wil not say thee nay: then Bethsabe willing to pleasure euen her very enemy, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1693:70"/>
in so small a matter as she thought, sayde vnto Adoniah: well I will speake for thee vnto the King my Sonne. So Bethsabe comming vnto the king Salomon her sonne, to speake vnto him for Adoniah, the king as soone as he sawe her, rose vp to meete her: and in token of reuerence, and that others by his good example might haue her being his mother in greater honour, and to teach all children (how hye in dignitie soeuer they are aboue their parentes) their duetie towardes their parentes, he bowde or humbled him selfe vnto her, and sitting agayne in his throne, he caused a seate to be set for his mother by him, and shee satte on his right hande. Then shee preferring Adoniah suite, sayde vnto Salomon: I desire a small request of thee, saye me not naye: vnto whome the king gently aunswered, Aske on my mother, for I will not say thee nay. My request is quoth shee, that thou wilt let Abisaag the shunamitisse be giuen to Adoniah thy brother to wife: But king Salomon wisely perceiuing further mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to lurke in that request, then his mother who made it a light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was aware off, and knowing that if hee shoulde graunt Abishag (that was so deere vnto his father at her request) vnto Adoniah, hee woulde afterwarde by that meanes, aspire vnto the kingdome, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his mother thus, O good mother, and why doest thou aske Abisaag the Shunamite for Adoniah, you might as well aske for him the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome also: for hee is mine elder brother, and hath for him both Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar the priest, and Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah, as thou knowest, as if he woulde say, if I should graunt you the one, he will thereby soone aspire to the other hauing such meanes, therfore I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not for my safety graunt your request so preiudiciall to my royall estate, so shee departed without her purpose, and Salomon wisely to preuent the aspiring purpose of Adoneah, went straight waies and put him to death. <hi>1.

                     <p>Finally, so godly, wise, and learned a woman was this Bethsabe, that Salomon her sonne, being nowe a king, yea and a most wise and learned king, yet she, to shewe her duetie &amp; motherly affection towards him her childe, taught him the doctrine and preceptes of good life, and howe he shoulde rule and gouerne to the glorye of God and his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall prayse and renowne.</p>

Israel were giuen by the Lorde for their sinnes into the handes of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byn King of Canaan, and inuaded by Sisara his captaine, and a great hoste of enymyes. They went to Deborah vnto her house, that dwelte vnder a Palme tree, betweene Ramah and Bethel in Mounte Ephraim, and in great sorrowe and lamentation asked her aduise: who vnderstanding the matter, sente presently for Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack: who being come, she sayde vnto him: hath not the Lorde GOD of Israel (reuealed vnto mee by the spirite of prophecie) and commaunded thee, saying, goe to Mounte Tabor with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men? And I (saieth the Lord) wil drawe vnto thee to the riuer Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Sisera with all his huge hoste, and delyuer him into thy hande. But Barak seeing his owne weakenesse, and his enemies power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Deborah the Prophetesse to goe with him, to assure him of Gods will from tyme to tyme: saying, If thou wilt goe with me, I will goe: But if thou wilt not goe with me, I will not goe. Then sayd Deborah, I will surely go with thee (as thou desirest:) but (for thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust and doubtfull minde, knowe thou this, that) this iourney which thou takest shall not therefore be for thine honour: for the Lorde shall sel Sisera into the handes of a woman. So Deborah arose and went with Barak and all his host to Kedesh. And when she saw Sisera and his army come ready to wage battell with Barak, she still incouraged him to the enterprise, by assuring him of Gods fauour and ayd, saying, vp Barak: for this is the day that the Lord hath deliuered Sisara into thyne hands. Is not the Lord gone out before thee (to fight for thee?) So the Lorde according to her wordes hauing destroyed the armye of Iabin, and forced Sisara to light downe of his chariot, and flye away on his feete. Barak pursued after him: but hee beeing escaped his handes, and hid in the tente or house of one Iael, the wife of Heber, and a faythful friende to Israel, was there slaine by the said Iael, (as in her storie more plainly appeareth) vntyll at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length Barak stil pursuing after Sisara, came and found him dead in the tent of Iael: and so lost hee the honour of the victory, and Iael got it, as Deborah before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied. And thus Deborah by her pollicye and wisdome, through Gods power and Baraks helpe, assisting and working for her and her people, deliuered her people mightely from the tyranny of Iaben, Sisara, and all their enimies, that had vexed them verye sore the space of twentie yeare before, and were set at peace and libertie, and their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies vtterly confounded.</p>

betray her husbande, saying: Entice Sampson, and see wherein his great stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth lieth, and learne by what meanes wee may best ouercome him, that we may come and binde him and punish him after our desire: and for thy labour euery one of vs shall giue thee a xi. hundred shekels of siluer (which commeth to foure score and a xi. pounds, thirteene shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings foure pence a man, after xx.d, a shekel: and saith Lyra, they being fiue in number, it amounteth in all to the summe of 336.li.xiii.s.iiii.d. Then Dalila being thus bribed or entised, for couetousnesse of so much money went and saide vnto Sampson: Tell me I pray thee wherein thy great strength lyeth, &amp; whereby thou mightest be bound to do thee hurt? And Sampson mistrusting her nothing at all, he was so blinded with her loue, tolde her saying, if they binde me with vii. grene cordes or withes, then shall I lie as weake as another man. So she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten of the Philistines vii. grene cords, bound Sampson there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and hauing certaine men of the Philistines lying readie in waite with her in a secrete chamber, she then cryed out vnto Sampson, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Philistines are vpon thee Sampson, shift for thy selfe. But Sampson brake the cordes as a threed and escaped, so that his strength coulde not be knowen by her craft. Then saide Dalila vnto Sampson, see, thou hast mocked me and tolde me lies, I pray thee nowe yet tell me wherein thou mightest be bounde. And Sampson, though her falshoode tended to make him loose his life, yet his affection towardes her so blinded him, that he coulde not beware, but tolde her, saying: If they binde me with newe ropes that were neuer occupied, then shall I bee weake and like other men. Dellida therefore tooke newe ropes, and bounde him againe therewith, and saide as before: The Philistines bee vpon thee Sampson. But as her spies came out of her chamber to haue taken him: he brake them also from his armes as a threede and escaped againe the second time. After this Delilah saide vnto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the thirde time, hitherto Sampson thou hast beguiled mee, and told me lyes, tell mee yet howe thou mayest bee bound. And hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing place still to his wicked affections, tolde her againe the thirde time, saying: If thou plat seuen lockes of the haire of my head with the threades of the woofe, I shall bee weake, so shee fastened it with a pinne, and cryed as afore, The Philistines are vpon thee Sampson, the Philistines are vpon thee: but hee awoke out of his sleepe, and went away with the pinne of the webbe and woofe. Then Dalila
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1693:73"/>
being verie angrie that hee had so often mocked her, beganne to chide him saying, Howe canst thou say as thou continually doest vnto mee, I loue thee Dalila, I loue thee, when thine heart is not with mee? Thou hast mocked mee nowe these three times together, and hast not as yet tolde mee wherein thy great strength lieth. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee was importunate vpon him with her words continually, and vexed him, his soule was pyned to the death, therefore hee vp and tolde her all his heart, and saide vnto her: If I bee shauen, and my haire cut off, my strength will goe from mee, and I shall bee as weake as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are. So when Delilah sawe that hee had tolde her all his heart: shee went priuily for the Princes of the Philistines that had bribed her to doe the feate, saying, come vp once againe, for hee hath she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed mee nowe all his hearte: then the Princes of the Philistines came vp to her and brought their money in their handes, which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised her. And Dalila then so dallied with Sampson that she made him lie a sleepe vpon her knees, and whilest he lay downe his head in her lappe, and was a sleepe, she caused a man that she had readie for the purpose to come and shaue off the seuen lockes of the haire of his head, whereby she began to vexe his soule and his strength was quite gone from him: not so much for the losse of his haire, but for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the ordinaunce of God, whiche was the cause that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him. Then hauing wrought her feate, she after her accustomed maner, cryed vnto him and saide: The Philistines are vpon thee Sampson, the Philistines are vpon thee. And with that hee awoke out of his sleepe, and thinking to escape them nowe as hee had done before, he shooke himselfe: But knowing not that the Lord was departed from him, he had no power or strength left to flie away: and therefore the Princes of the Philistines then tooke him and bound him hand and foote nowe at the last, and put out his eyes, and carried him away bounde in fetters to Azzah, where they made him a slaue to grinde in the prison house. And thus Sampsons inordinate affection towards a wicked woman caused him to loose Gods excellent giftes, and became a slaue vnto them, whom hee should haue ruled. Where wee see howe dangerous a thing it is, for any man or woman to giue place too much to our affections, for if we doe, without doubt we shall be sure to be destroyed, as Sampson was by Dalila, who thus by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked daliance betraid him to the Philistines for money. <hi>Iudg. 16.4. &amp;c.</hi>

giue thee ioye for this thy sorrowe: Bee of good comfort my daughter, weep not: so her daughter being well comforted, went to bed. And in the morning Edna sent her maide to see whether Tobie were aliue or not, who finding them both a sleepe and aliue, went and tolde her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and dame, and they for ioye praysed God together. And when the dayes of feasting were ended, and her daughter was to goe her way with her husbande to his friendes and countrie: Edna blessed her daughter, and gaue her ghostly instruction like a godly mother, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first to her: The God of heauen blesse thee my daughter, and make thy children to prosper before I die.

Beholde nowe I commit to thee my daughter as a pledge, doe not intreat her euill. So Tobias praysing God, that he had giuen him so good a wife: blessed Raguell and Edna his wife, and went away to Niniuie to his owne father and mother, whom when he had honourablie buried, then he returned with his wife to Ecbatan to Raguell and Edna his father and mother in lawe, whome also hee there buried honorablie and possessed their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then because he would aduertise Ester of this cruel decree and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, he came to the kings gate: but because he was so cloathed in sackcloath, he myght not be suffered to enter into the Courte: Yet Esters Maydes &amp; Eunuches hearing his piteous outcryes &amp; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, of goodwill they bare vnto her, wente and tolde her, how her Cosin mourned in sackcloath: with which newes she good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being grieued at the heart, was very heauy and sad, and sent Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay her cosin better rayment to cloath himselfe withal, and willed the messenger to take away his sackcloath from him: but he receyued it not, neyther would he cast off his attyre. Then Ester called Hathach her Eunuch, whome the King had appoynted to serue and attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her, and commanded him to goe out vnto Mordecay, and know the matter &amp; cause of his mourning, &amp; why he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t so clad in sackcloth, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to Mordecay, &amp; vnderstanding the whole matter, brought with him a copy of the letters procured by Haman against her and her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and delyuered it to queene Ester, with this request from her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin Mordecay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she would presently vpon the receite therof, al other things layde aparte, goe to the King, and make petition and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plycation before him for her peoples safetye and lyues, or else they were al lyke to perishe. So Ester hauing nowe knowledge of this deuillish decree, at the first durst not satisfie the request of her cosin Mordecay: but sent the same messenger Hathach backe againe vnto Mordecay, to signifie vnto him, that forasmuch as there was a lawe, that no man or woman myght presume to goe vnto the King in his priuye chamber vncalled vnder payne of death, but onelye he or she vnto whome the King helde out his scepter, or golden rodde, that therfore shee nowe hauing beene absent the space of thirtie dayes, durste not presume to goe vnto the King vncalled for her lyfe: but was afrayd of that daunger.

Which letter or message, when Ester receiued, shee therewith being touched to farther remorse, sent Mordecay woorde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, that hee goe and assemble the Iewes to fast and pray publikely for her, three dayes and three nightes, that God woulde prosper her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise as shee and her maides woulde doe, and then shee promised him that shee woulde put her life in daunger, and goe vnto the king vncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, though it were contrary to the lawe, and if I perishe (quoth she) I perishe: yet will I referre the successe to God, seeing it is for the glorye of his name, and the deliueraunce of his Church.</p>

I am thy brother, bee of good cheere, thou shalt not die: for our commaundement tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the commons, and not thee, come neere. So Ester founde fauour in his sight, and the king in signe that her comming, was agreeable vnto him, and not to the breache of the lawe: helde out his golden Scepter that was in his hande, and layde it vppon her necke, and kissed her, and sayde, talke with mee. Then sayde shee, I sawe thee O Lorde, as an Angel of God, and myne heart was troubled for feare of thy maiestie, for wonderfull art thou O Lorde, and thy face is full of grace. And as she was thus speaking vnto him, shee fell downe againe before him for faintnesse. Then the king being sore troubled, did all that both hee and his seruauntes coulde, to comfort her: and the king helde out his septer againe vnto her, whiche shee touched and layde her hand vpon the toppe thereof, &amp; then the king sayd agayne vnto her: Be of good comfort Ester, &amp; feare nothing that is done against the Iewes, for our decree shal not touche thee: but tell me what wilt thou Queene Ester? and what is thy request? aske what thou wilt, it shall be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee: yea, it shall be euen giuen vnto thee though it bee halfe my kingdome.</p>
                     <p>Then sayde Ester to the king: nothing O king, but that it woulde please your maiestie, and Haman to come this day vnto the banquet of wine, which I haue prepared: To the which hee with Haman gladely went, according to her desire, and whilest he was banqueting with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he demaunded of her agayne the same question, saying: what is thy petition Ester that it may be giuen thee?

And on the morrowe when the king and Haman were come againe vnto her banquet, he said again vnto the Q. now what is thy petition Ester that it may be giuen thee? aske, and it shalbe performed euen to the halfe of my kingdome. Then the Q. answered and sayd, if I haue founde so much fauour in thy sight O king, to haue my petition granted: then I most humbly beseech thee, graunt mee my life, and the liues of all my people the Iewes, whiche are not onely solde to be bondslaues, (yea I would to God it were no worse, for then I would haue held my tongue) but to be slayn and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroyed, &amp; that all in one day, which forceth me to speake boldely vnto thee. Who is he, saide the king, and where is the man that dare presume to do such a deed? Oh said Ester, and if it shall please your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie to know the truth, our great enemie and aduersary that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired our death, &amp; gotten out this decree against vs, is euen this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man Haman here present, whom your grace hath exalted so hie to honor &amp; estimation vnder you. At which words of Hester, Hamans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science barked, his heart quaked, his body waxed wan &amp; pale, his fleshe trembled, and he was terribly afraid of the king &amp; Queens displeasure. Yea the kings indignation was then so kindled against Haman at this the Q. complaint, that he arose in an anger from the banquet, and went into the pallace garden, in whose absence, Hama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (whose conscience stil accused him) perceiuing that there was some mischiefe a preparing for him of the king for his bloody &amp; cruel conspiracie, fel down at the beds feet or couch wherevpon Ester sate, and made humble request vnto her for his life. And when the king came againe out of the garden, &amp; found Haman fallen vpon the bed where Ester sat, being therby more incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against him, he very angerly said, what will he force the Q. also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my face? which worde was no sooner proceeded forth of the kings mouth, but it gaue his garde and seruantes occasion presently to laye handes vpon Haman, and to couer his face, as they vsed to doe vnto all that were out of the kings fauour, who forthwith also at the kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, went and hanged Haman therefore vpon the same Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had prepared for to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Mordecay, Esters cosin, after whose death, the very same day did the king giue vnto Ester the Queene, all Hamans goodes and landes.</p>

And when E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster had thus farre preuayled against Haman, for her owne safetie, shee gaue her cosin Mordecay al Hamans house, as freely as it was giuen her, to his preferment. And afterward, she falling downe prostrate at the kings feete, with teares besought him to graunt her one requeste more, which was that his grace woulde vtterly abolishe the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees which hee had made for the destruction of the Iewes her people, saying: if it please the king, if I haue founde fauour in his sight, or the thing be acceptable before him, and that I please him, let letters bee written and sent to all his prouinces, to reuoke and countermande the letters of Hamans cruel deuise sent agaynst my people y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes.

Or howe can I suffer and see the destruction of my kinred? So the king granted her request, and she hauing obtayned the letters of countermande, sealed with the kinges own signet and ring, deliuered them to Mordecay, who with all speede by postes, conueyed them to all the prouinces in Percia and Medea, to the great comfort of the Iewes, and daunting of the enemies. Yea, the king for Esters sake, not onely by the same his letters reuoked the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wicked decree: but also he therein gaue commaundement &amp; leaue to euery Iewe, to kill his enemie that purposed to kill them, by meanes whereof Hamans ten sonnes also amongest diuers others in Sushan, were slayne with the sword before the kings gate, which being known vnto the king, he sayd vnto Ester (because he woulde satisfie her request to the full, and gratifie her to the vttermoste, if it were possible,) Thy countreymen and people the Iewes haue by force of my letters nowe slaine and destroyed, euen in Sushan my pallace, fiue hundred men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sid the ten sonnes of Haman: what trowest thou, haue they then done in the rest of my prouinces? nowe therefore Hester, if this content thee not for a sufficient reuenge of that villanie that they offered thy people, then what doest thou require yet further of mee: aske and I will giue it thee?

So Hagar being thus departed from Abraham with her young childe Ishmael in her armes, gate her vnto the wildernesse of Beershe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba: where shee wandered so long vp and downe, till all her prouision of meate and drinke was spent &amp; gone. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she saw no remedy but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both she and the child must needs perish for lacke of sustenaunce, shee in this great perplexitie, renounced all naturall affection and distrusting in Gods prouidence, notwithstanding that she had had good experience therof before time, went and cast her childe Ishmael vnder a certayne

went vp to the house of the Lorde, to sacrifice and serue God, her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion would so vexe her herewith to her great reproch, that she would sitte and weepe and lament greatly in fasting and prayer in her house before she went out adores: which when her husband perceiued, he to comfort her said vnto her: Hannah, why weepest thou, and why eatest thou not? And why is thy heart thus troubled? am not I thy louing husband better to thee then ten sonnes? Let this suffice thee, that I ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly loue thee, no lesse then if thou hadst manye children. So Hanna to satisfie her husbands mynd, did eate and drinke a little, but yet bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of heauinesse, that God had made her such a rayling stocke, that she could not quietly eate nor drinke, nor serue GOD as shee ought, shee arose and went to the Temple of the Lorde in Siloe where the Arke then was, to woorshippe GOD. And there beeyng tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and troubled in minde, shee made her heartie prayers vnto GOD, with teares, to geue her a sonne or manchild, the forme of which prayer or vowe appeareth in the first Lampe of Uirginitie, pag. 6. And as she continued praying very earnestly in the Temple before the Lorde, it fortuned that Eli the high Priest, as he sate there also, marked her mouth, and perceiuing her lippes onely to moue a little, &amp; no voyce heard (for she prayed mentally and secretly in her heart,) he thought she had bin dronken and said vnto her Thou woman, how long wilt thou be dronken, put away thy dronkennes from thee? Then Hannah being further vexed in mind to see her selfe thus interrupted in her prayers, and more slaundered by the rash iudgement of so graue a man, could no lesse but make him this aunsweare in her excuse, and sayd: Nay my Lord, I am not dronke, neyther haue I drunken eyther wyne, or strong drinke: But I beyng a woman troubled in minde, &amp; dexed in spirite, I doe here powre out my sorowfull soule before the Lorde in mentall or secret prayer: therefore doe not so rashly count thy handmayde to be the daughter of Beliall, or a wicked woman, for out of the abundance of the heauinesse and griefe of my heart haue I spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hitherto. Then goe in peace sayde Eli, and the GOD of Israel graunt thy petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that thou hast asked. And (she knowing that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of others would be of force with God towardes her,) desired Ely to pray for her, saying: O let thine handmayden find grace in thy sight, and be remembred in thy prayers offered vnto God. And so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing her selfe to the mercie of God, and commending her self to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes prayers, she departed cheerefully home to her house, where she ate
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1693:83"/>
and dranke merrily, and looked no more sad. And shortly after God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred her according to her petition, so that in processe of time she conceyued by Elkana her husband, and bare him a sonne in the yeere of the world 3000. or therabouts, whose name she called Samuel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she begged him of God. And when she had geuen her child sucke, and brought him vp and weaned it, she like a vertuous mother prepared a sacrifice, and went to the temple of the Lord in Sylo, with her young sonne, and there presented before the Lord both her offering and childe to Ely the high Priest, whom she then put in remembrance thereof, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: oh my Lord as certainly as thy soule liueth, my Lorde, I am the woman that stoode with thee here of late, praying vnto the Lorde for this child: and because my Lorde hath geuen me my desire, which I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of him, therefore also I now (according to my vowe and promise, made in my prayer) am come to dedicate him vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, vnto whom I haue geuen him while he liueth. And so after a notable song of praise and thankes giuing made by her vnto God for her childe, as appeareth in the first Lampe pag. 6. She departed with her husband home, and lefte her child Samuel with Ely the Priest, to minister in the temple of God in all that Ely commanded him. So Samuel her child beyng but young ministred before the Lorde, gyrded with a linnen Ephod. And euery yeere after did Hannah his mother make a little coate for Samuel her sonne, and bring it vp to him when she came with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to offer the yeerely sacrifice, as the custome then was, once euerie yeere to appeare before the Lord with their families. And when she came into the house of God, Ely the Priest blessed her husband, &amp; her saying: The Lord geue thee seed of this woman for the petitions that she asked of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. And so departed they home againe vnto their place in mount Ephraim where they dwelt. And thus God tooke away her rebuke of barrennes and visited her and blessed her with moe children, so that after Samuel she conceiued and bare three sonnes moe, and two daughters, to her great comfort and the reioycing of her husband. <hi>1.

And so by the wicked deuise of this vnchaste woman Saynt Iohn Baptist lost his head, to the greate trouble of the Churche, and griefe of Christ Iesus and his Disciples. <hi>Matth. 14.1.</hi>

                     <p>She was the last reasonable creature that God made in Paradise, and the first woman that euer was. For when all creatures and Adam were made, Adam hauing now geuen names to all creatures, and God seyng that among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, he could not find one helper meet for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s society, said: It is not good y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> man should be himself alone, I will make him an help meet for him, &amp; so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 6. day of the worlds creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, caused an heauy sleep to fal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; whilest he slept, he took one of his ribbes &amp; closed vp the flesh in steede therof. And of the ribbe which the Lord God had taken out from the man made he the woman, to finishe and make perfect the woorkemanshippe of mankinde by the womans creation, whiche before was like an vnperfect buylding.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1693:84"/>
And the woman being thus created, the Lorde brought her to the man to see how he would name her, and to make her his mate: who assoone as he saw her, sayd thus of her, This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shalbe called woman (or mannes) because she was taken out of man. Thus Adam and the woman being coupled together as man &amp; wife by the Lord in paradise: (to shew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> marriage requireth a greater duetie towards our wiues, and likewise the wife to the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, then otherwise we are bound to our Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And being both put in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure called Eden, or Paradise, Sathan enuying their felicity, as he can change himselfe into an Angel of light: so did he now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the woman aunsweared the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, saying, We eate of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath sayd yee shal not eate of it, neyther shall ye touch it least ye die. Then the serpent or Sathan (whose chief subtilty was to cause Heua not to feare gods threatnings) say<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> vnto the woman, ye shall not dye at all. But GOD doth know that when ye shall eate thereof your eyes shalbe opened, and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and euill, as though he should say, God doth not forbid ye to eate of the fruite, saue that he knoweth if you should eate therof, yee shall be like to him. So the woman Heua doubting of Gods threatning yeelded to Sathan, and seyng that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tree was good for meate, and that it was pleasant to the eye, and a tree to be desired to get knowledge, she tooke of the fruite therof and did eate. And beyng thus beguiled through the subtiltie of the serpent, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy of the Deuil, she was first deceiued, and guilty of the transgression of Gods commaundement: And so consequently, the beginning of sin and first entraunce of death ouer all flesh into the world. She gaue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the same fruite vnto her husband Adam, and so entised him also to sinne with her. And he (not so much to please his wife, as moued by ambition at her perswasion) did eate also of the forbidden fruit. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1693:84"/>
immediatly the eyes of them both being opened, they knew that they were naked, and began to feele their miserie: but yet starting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, as those that had no grace to seeke to him for remedie, they foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly sewed figge leaues together, and made themselues breeches thereof, or things to gyrde about their loynes to hyde their priuities: and so hauing sinfull consciences, hid themselues for shame from the presence of the Lorde God (as they thought) emong the trees of the garden. And this fall of Adam and Eue was as some thinke vpon the tenth day of May. But the Lord God walking in the mids of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the coole of the day, with a mighty voyce called first vnto the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and sayd, Adam where art thou? Who aunsweared, Lord, I heard thy voyce and was afraid, because I was naked: and therefore hid I my selfe. Wherein his hipocrisie appeared in that he hid from God the cause of his nakednes, which was the transgression of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. And the Lord saide vnto Adam: who told thee that thou wast naked, hast thou eaten of the tree wherof I commanded that thou shouldest not eate in no case? Then Adam said, the woman which thou gauest to be with me, she gaue me of the tree and I did eate. Where note the wickednesse and lacke of true repentaunce in Adam, in that he burdened God with his fault, because he had geuen him a wife which entised him to offend.</p>
                     <p>Then the Lorde called the woman and saide vnto her: why hast thou done this? And the woman Heua also in stead of confessing her fault, increased it by accusing the Serpent, saying: The Serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled me and I did eate. Thus God hauing asked the reason of the man and the woman, because he would bring them to some remorce and repentaunce for their sinne that he might haue mercie vpon them, if they had had the grace to confesse their follies, as like Hypocrites they posted it of from one to another, woulde no longer stand reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or debating the matter so with the Serpent, because he would shewe him no compassion at all: but straight cursing and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also to Adam GOD sayde, because thou hast obeyed the voyce of thy wife, and eaten of the forbidden fruite, cursed is the earth for thy sake, in sorrow shalt thou eate of it all the daies of thy life. Thornes also and thistles, as vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall fruites proceeding of the corruption of sinne, shall it bring foorth vnto thee, &amp; thou shalt eate the herbs of the field: yea, in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate bread, til thou returne to the earth, for out of it wast thou taken, because thou art dust, &amp; to dust shalt thou returne. Thus the transgression of Gods commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in Adam and Eue, was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause that both they &amp; all mankind in them together with all other creaturs were subiect to the curse of God.</p>

And nowe least he should put foorth his hande, and take also of the tree of life, and eate and liue for euer, therefore the Lorde God hauing first made coastes of skinnes to cloath both Adam and Eua, or geuen them knowledge to make themselues garmentes to couer their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, he sent them foorth and cast out man and woman from the garden of Eden, to till the earth whence they were taken.

Proclaime a fast, and set Naboth among the chiefe of the people, and set two wicked men before him, and let them witnesse against him, saying: <q>Thou didst blaspheme God and the king, then carrie him out, and stone him, that he may die.</q> Which letters when the Elders had receyued, they like wicked worldlinges.
obeyed rather the wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of this wicked Princesse: then the iust lawe of God, who willeth not to consent to the shedding of innocent blood: and did as Iezabell had written in the letters sent vnto them, and hauing thus truelly without all equitie vnder colour of lawe put innocent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both and his sonnes to death, they sent Iesabell worde therof: who so soone as shee heard thereof, went to her husband lying languishing on his bed, and sayde, vp now (man) and take possession of Naboths Uin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde for nought, which he before refused to giue thee for money: for beholde he as a trangressor of the lawe is stoned to death, and all his sonnes that should inherite it, and resist thy purpose by clayming pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: which she did that her husband might enioy it the more quietly. With which newes Achab being reuiued, straight wayes arose and went to take possession of Naboths vineyarde, as his wife counselled him: but as he was in the Uineyarde taking possession, God sent his Prophete Elia vnto him, whiche reprooued Achab and his wife with terrible threatninges of Gods iudgementes, saying, first to Ahab. Hast thou killed and also gotten possession Ahab, or doest thou thinke to haue any aduauntage by murthering of the innocent?

therefore in the place where dogges licked the blood of Naboth, euen there shall dogges licke euen thy bloud also, because thou hast shed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood and solde thy selfe to worke wickednesse in the sight of the Lorde, &amp;c. And also as concerning thy wife Iezabel, thus sayeth the Lorde of her: that forasmuch as she whose nature or kynd shoulde haue abhorred all tyrannie, and ben moued and inclined to all pitie, mercie, and compassion, hath contrariwise geuen and horrible example of most monstrous crueltie in womenkinde, and not onlie geuen wicked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to her husband to become a vile Idolater, and cruel murtherer: but also ben as one that geueth her selfe wholly to serue all maner of sinne: therfore the dogs shal eate her also in the field, or by the wall of her pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in Iezreel, &amp; there shall be none to burie her. With terrible words of the Prophet when Ahab heard, he rent his clothes and repented his sinnes in dust, ashes, and sackcloth, which caused the Lorde by and by to haue mercie vpon him, and to turne the euill from him vnto his sonne Iorams dayes. But as for Iezabel the holie Ghost maketh no mention that euer she blushed at the matter or once repented of her villanny: but went on stil in her Idolatry and abhominable life, during her husband Ahabs raigne, &amp; the raigne of Ahaziah and Iehoram her two sonnes. Insomuch, as when her sonne Iehoram was sicke of wounds &amp; an hurt that the Aramites had geuen him, God raysed vp Iehue to bee king, who being made an instrument of God to execute his foresaide iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against the house of Ahab y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king to auenge the blood of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes the Prophetes and seruaunts, shed by the hand of Iezabel: He conspired against Ioram, who meeting Iehue in the fielde of Naboth the Israelite, demaunded of Iehue, saying: comest thou peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Iehue?

And after Iehu had caused the dead corpes of Ioram to be put and cast in the field of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, to fulfil the word of the Lord against Achab, whiche was nowe first accomplished in his sonne Ioram, after this iudgement of God (I say) executed vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne for imitating the sinnes of his father Achab &amp; mother Iezabel: Iehu went towards Iezreel to do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like iudgement in reuenging of Gods cause vpon the mother Iezabel that lay there.</p>

With that two of her own Eunuches of chief seruants loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out vnto Iehu, and he said vnto them, cast her downe, &amp; they at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement straight waies tooke her in their armes, &amp; with such vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence cast her downe out of her window (as she lay vaunting her selfe and rayling against Iehu) that she was dashed all to peeces, &amp; so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably died with the fal, who being thus dead, Iehu also besprinkled her blood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wall &amp; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the horses, and trode her delicate corpes vnder his horses feet. Which he did by the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods spirit, that her blood should be shed, who had so often shed the blood of innocents, to be a spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle and example of Gods iudgementes to all tyrauntes, oppressors, &amp; idolatrous persecutors. And when Iehu was entred into her house and had well refreshed himselfe with meate and drinke, he beyng wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling yet that she shoulde haue had the honour of buriall: sayde to some of his men, Go, visit you yonder cursed woman and bury her, because she is a kings daughter. But when they came to take her vp to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, they found no more of her body left but the scull, and the feete, and the palmes of her hands, (for the dogges had eaten the rest:) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Iehu being aduertised, he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sayd, now is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God &amp; prophesy of Elias spoken of before, fulfilled, which sayd, In the field of Iezreel shal the dogges eate the flesh of Iezabel, &amp; the carcas of Iezabel shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be as doung vpon the ground in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field of Iezreel, so that none shall say, This is Iezabel, this was done in the yeere of the worlde 3240.

And when she bare Moses in Egypt, and was commaunded by king Pharao to cast him in the riuer to be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as all the Hebrewes among the Egyptians were: Iochebed seeing that Moses her sonne was a very faire and proper child, with a good faith in God, not fearing the kinges commaundement, went and hidde him the space of three monethes: but when she could no longer hide him on the land, she in the same faith in God, tooke an Arke or Cradell made of wicker or of reede, and daubed it with lome, slime and pitche, and layd the child therein, and put it among bulrushes by the riuers brinke: committing her childe to the prouidence of God, whom shee could not keepe from the rage of that blooddy tyrant. So whilest Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam her daughter &amp; his sister stoode a farre off, watching what would become of the child her brother: Behold it happened that the daughter of the same tyrant Pharao, came to wash her selfe in the riuer, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest her maydens walked along by the riuers side: and being come to the banke, she saw the arke among the bulrushes, and sent her maydes straight to fetch it, who brought the arke vnto her, and she then opened it in the presence of her maydes and his sister, and finding the child in it, sayd, surely this is one of the Hebrues children: and she hearing the babe weepe and cry for sustenance, had compassion on it and was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with pitie towards it. Wherevpon his sister Miriam being come neere vnto them to see the euent, said vnto Pharaos daughter, shall I goe and call vnto thee a nurse of the Hebrue women to nurse the child for thee. Yea (quoth Pharaos daughter) goe thy way. So the mayd his sister went and called this Iochebed the childes mother and hers, to whom Pharaos daughter committed the childe to nurse saying, take this childe away and nurse it for me, and I will reward thee. Then Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebed tooke her owne child and nursed it, and so was Moses preserued from perishing by water, as the king had cruelly commanded. Wherby we see that mans counsell cannot hinder that which God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined shall come to passe, nor destroy that which he wil haue saued.

Wherevpon the people with one consent, men, women &amp; children, ran to Oseas the hie Priest, and chiefe elders of the city, &amp; cryed out vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to yeeld, &amp; giue ouer the citie to Olophernes in time, least they al perished through their neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, who exhorted them to tarry and wayte yet fiue dayes longer for the mercy of God, and if he helped them not in that space, the elders woulde doe as they had required.</p>
                     <p>Then Iudith, who all this while had kept her house, and was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in fasting and prayer, hearing of the euill words of the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gouernours for lacke of water, and what promise Ozias &amp; the elders had made vnto the people, to deliuer the city vnto the enemy within 5. daies, she sent her mayd Abra that had the gouernment of all things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she had, for Ozias &amp; the other auncients of the city, &amp; made this learned oration vnto them saying: <q>Heare me O yee Gouernours of the inhabitaunts of Bethulia, for your wordes that yee haue spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people this day are not right, touching this othe and promise that ye haue made &amp; pronounced between God &amp; you, &amp; haue promised to deliuer the city to the enemy, vnles within these 5. daies the Lorde turne to helpe you. And now what men are yee, that yee haue tempted God this day, &amp; set your selues in Gods steede among the children of men?</q>
So now you seeke the Lord almighty, but yee shall neuer know
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1693:90"/>
any thing, for you can not find out the depth of the heart of man, neither can ye perceiue the thinges that he thinketh: then how can you search out God, that hath made all these thinges, and know his mind, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende his purpose? Nay my brethren, prouoke not the Lorde our God to anger: for if he will not helpe vs within these fiue dayes, hee hath power to defende vs when he will, euen euery day, or to destroy vs before our enemies. Doe not you therefore binde the counsayles of the Lorde our God, for God is not as man, that hee may bee threatned, neyther as the sonne of man to bee brought to iudgement. Therefore this your deuise, obtayneth no mercy of God, but rather prouoketh him to wrath and displeasure. Will yee set the mercy of the Lorde a tyme, and appoint him a day at your will? No, exhort the people to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and prayer, and let vs heartily fall downe before him, and serue him with a meeke spirite, and with weeping eyes say vnto the Lorde, that hee deale with vs according to his owne will speedily in mercie: that like as our heart is nowe vexed and brought low through the pride of our enemies, it may so be comforted by his grace. Yea, let vs wayte for saluation of him, and call vppon him to helpe vs, and he will heare our voyce, if it please him. For there appeareth none in our age, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any nowe in these dayes, neyther of tribe, nor family, nor people, nor citie among vs which worshippe the gods made with hands, as hath bin afore time of our forefathers: for the which sin, our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were giuen to the sworde for a spoyle, and had a great fall before our enemyes: as appeareth <hi>Iudg. 2.11.4.1.6.1.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as for vs, wee knowe none other God but onely the Lorde: therefore we trust that he will not despise vs, nor any of our lynage: yea for his comfort let vs tarie with meekenesse, and he shall require and make inquisition for our blood from the vexation of our enemies: hee shall bring downe all the heathen that rise vp agaynst vs, and put them to dishonour: euen the Lorde our God shall doe it, neyther when wee shall be taken, shall Iudea be so famous: for our Sanctuarie shall bee spoyled, and hee will require the prophanation thereof at our mouth. And the feare of the people our brethren, &amp; the captiuitie of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the desolation of our inheritaunce (which they rather wishe) will he turne vpon our heades among the Gentiles wheresoeuer we shall bee in bondage, and wee shal be an offence and reproch to all them that possesse vs: for our seruitude shall not be directed by fauour: but the Lord our God shall turne it to dishonour. Now therefore, O deere
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1693:91"/>
brethren, Let vs shewe an example to our brethren the people: because their heartes depende vpon you, and the Sanctuary, and the house and the altar rest all vppon you, that are the honourable and elders in the people of God. Moreouer, let vs giue thankes to the Lorde our God, whiche tryeth vs euen as hee did our fathers, and lift yee vp the heartes of the people with your exhortations, that they may call to remembraunce howe our fathers also in times paste were temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they might bee prooued, if they woorshipped theyr God aright: yea put them in minde of this I saye, how that our father Abraham being tempted and tryed through manye tribulations, was found a louer and friende of God. So was Isaak, so was Iacob, so was Moses, and all they that pleased GOD passed stedfast in fayth through manifolde troubles: but they that receiued not their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the feare of God, but put them selues forth with impatience and murmuring against God, peryshed of the destroyer, and were slaine of serpentes. And therefore, seeing the Lorde hath not tryed vs, as he did them to the examination of their hearts, neyther doth hee take vengeance on vs: we also should not vndertake to be reuenged for the thinges that are done vnto vs: but to consider that al these punishments are farre lesse then our sinnes and misdeedes, and beleeuing that this correction commeth vnto vs, as to the seruants of God, for our amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and instruction, and not for our destruction.</p>
                     <p>Thus her eloquent and godly oration being ended, Ozias the chief gouernour, then to her great commendation sayde vnto Iudith, as followeth: All that thou hast spoken, thou hast spoken with a good heart, and it is true, and there is no man can reproue or resist thy words. For it is not to day that thy wisdome is knowne, but from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thy lyfe haue we knowne thy wisdome: for the deuise of thine heart is good: but the people for very thirst compelled vs to make that oth and promyse vnto them which we may not transgresse. Therefore now pray thou for vs vnto God, because thou art a holy woman, &amp; fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord may send vs rayne to fil our cesterns, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we faynte no more. Unto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iudith replied &amp; said vnto Ozias &amp; the rest of the gouernours: seeing ye know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my words are of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare me, &amp; proue my counsaile &amp; deuise, I pray you, if it be of God: for I will do a thing, which shalbe declared in al generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our nation, &amp; beseech yee God for me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil bring my counsaile &amp; deuise to good end. Thus haue I deuised: ye shal stand this night in the gate before the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1693:91"/>
porte gate of Bethulia: And I wil go forth with Abra my handmaiden, and pray ye therefore vnto God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will graciously visite and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his people Israel by mine hand, and deliuer the citie from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, within these fiue dayes that ye haue promised the people to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie. But as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> act or thing that I goe in hand withall, aske ye no questions of it, nor make further enquirie of me: for I will not declare it vnto you, till God haue finished that I doe, &amp; till I bring you word agayne, do ye nothing els but pray, pray vnto the Lorde our God for mee. Then Ozias the prince of the people of Iuda, with the rest of the Elders, said: hoe Iudith, Go thy way in peace, the Lord God be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thee, &amp; before thee, to take vengeance on our enemies. So taking their leaue of Iudith, they returned from the tent, and went from her agayne euery man to their wardes.</p>
                     <p>Nowe when the gouernours were gone their way, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iudith went into her secret closet, and there clothed her self with sackcloth, strawed ashes vpon her head, and fell down vpon her face before the Lord. And about the time that the incense of the euening was offered in Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in the house of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde, she cried vnto the Lord w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a loud voice, and made her humble prayers for the deliuerance of her people, saying: O Lord God of my fathers, &amp;c. as it is in the 1.

shee had before counselled them. Who seeing Iudith thus gorgiouslye attyred and chaunged, they as men astonished, merueyled greatly at her wonderfull beautie: for the Lorde had encreased her farenesse, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her a speciall beautie, so that shee was exceeding amiable and well fauoured in all mens eyes, and they asking no questions at her: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their prayer vnto God for her, let her goe, saying, The Lord God of our fathers giue thee grace and fauour, and with his power performe &amp; accomplish all the deuices and enterprises of thine heart, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the children of Israell, and to the exaltation of Ierusalem: that Ierusalem I say may reioyce ouer thee, and that thy name may bee in the number of the holy &amp; righteous, And all they that were there after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, saide with one voyce, So be it.</p>
                     <p>Then after their prayer ended, Iudith saide to Ozias: Commande the gates of the citie to bee opened vnto mee, that I may goe foorth to accomplishe the thinges whiche you haue spoken vnto mee. So the gates being opened at her request: shee tooke her leaue of the people, and with her maide Abra, wente out in the night: the people still persisting in heartie prayer for her, and beseeching the Lorde to bee her defence, and well to performe the deuice of her heart, that they myght safely, and ioyfully receiue her presence agayne, and so committing her to God, shutte the gates, and looked ouer the walles after her, so longe as they coulde see her. And as she was gone past the mountaynes, and kept her way straite in the valley, it happened that about the spring of the day: the first watch and spies of the Assyrians mette with her, and tooke her, and asked her saying: of what people art thou? and whence commest thou? or whether goest thou? And Iudith answered, I am a woman or daughter of the Hebrewes, and am fled from them: I know they shall bee giuen you to be spoyled and consumed, because they thought scorne to yeelde them selues vnto you, that they might finde mercie in your sight. Therefore haue I deuised by my selfe after this maner, I will go before the prince Olophernes, the chiefe captayne of your armie, and tell him all their secretes, &amp; will shew him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way how hee may come by them, and winne their citie without the losse of body, or life of any one of his men.</p>

So they set her and her mayde in a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotte, and beeing accompanied with an hundered men, brought her to Holophernes cent: where by reason her comming was bruted among the pauilions, or tentes of his souldiers, there was such a running too and fro to see her, that they came and stoode rounde about her as shee stoode without Olophernes tent, merueiling at her beawtie, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the children of Israel, because of her feature, comely, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly personage: insomuch, as euery one being immediatly ouercome &amp; taken with her beawtie, sayde one to another, who woulde dispise this people of the Iewes? that haue amonge them such goodly and fayre women. Should we not by reason fight agaynst them for these women if for nothing els? surely it is not good that one man of these bee lefte: for if they shoulde remayne, they might deceiue the whole earth. So when Olephernes was aduertised of her comming, and that shee stood without his tent, wayting to speake with him, hee sent his garde and seruauntes for her, who brought her neere vnto his tent doore: where he lay very stately vpon his bed vnder a canopie, whiche was wouen with purple, and golde, and emeraldes, and precious stones: and when his menne wente in and tolde him that Iudith was come: Olo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes came forth vnto the entrey of his tent lighted with Lampes of siluer (because it was in the night) carried before him, to meete her and welcome her. And when Iudith was come before him: he no sooner saw her, but immediatly he was ouercome and rauished with her beaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for both he and his seruants marueiled all thereat. So Iudith loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wishly vpon him, and being somewhat abashed at the first with his maiestie, shee fell downe vppon the earth as one almost dead for feare, and being reuiued agayne, did reuerence vnto Olofernes: and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants tooke her vp agayne at his commaundement.</p>
                     <p>Then saide Olofernes vnto her, woman, bee of good cheere, and feare not in thine heart: for I neuer hurt any that woulde serue Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of al the earth. As for thy people, if they had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised mee, I would not haue lift vp my speare against them, but they haue procured these thinges vnto themselues. But tell mee now, what is the cause that thou art fledde from them? And wherefore thou art

come vnto vs? For if thou be come for safegarde and succour: then bee of good comfort, thou shalt liue from this night and hereafter: for none shal hurt thee, but intreat thee well as they do the seruants of king Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer my Lord.
To whom Iudith made answere on this wise, saying: <q>Sir (quoth Iudith) if thou wilt receiue the words of thy hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, &amp; suffer thine handmaid to speake in thy presence, I will declare no lye vnto my Lord this night: And if thou wilt followe &amp; do after the wordes of thine handmaide, God will bring the thing perfectly to passe by thee, and my Lord shall not fayle of his purpose.

For wee heard of thy wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, of thy prudent spirit and actiuitie doe all people speake: yea, it is declared &amp; bruted through the whole earth, that thou onely art good, excellent, and mightie in all the kingdome, and of a wonderfull know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the feates of warre.

It is manifest and true, and wee haue heard of his words, for the men of Bethulia did take him, and hee declared vnto them all that hee had spoken vnto thee concerning vs, and the people of Israel. Nowe thrrefore, least my Lorde should bee frustrate and voyde of his purpose, and that death may fall vppon them, and that they may bee taken in their sinne whiles they prouoke their God to anger, which is so oft times as they doe that which is not beseeming. Yea, this is playne &amp; of a suretie, that our God is so wroth with vs, by reason of our sinnes, that he hath she'wed by his Prophetes vnto the people, how that far their sins he wil deliuer them ouer vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie. And for as much as the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Israel know that they haue so displeased their God, they are sore affrayde of thee: yea, and suffer great hunger also at this present: For want of drinke they are in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as dead men: for because their victualles fayle, aud their water is wasted, they haue in their extremitie determined to slay their cattel that they may drinke the blood of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; are purposed to consume all things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God hath forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to eate by his lawes.

they had reserued &amp; sanctified for the priests that serue in Ierusalem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of our God, the which thing it is not lawfull for any of the people to touch with their handes.

For if they do these things it is a playne case that they must needs be destroyed.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I thine handmaid knowing all this, am fled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to shew thee these things, for God hath sent me to worke a thing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the earth shall wonder, &amp; whosoeuer shal heare thereof. For I thy handmaid feare God, &amp; worship the God of heauen day and night. And nowe I pray thee let me remaine with thee my Lord, &amp; let thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmaid go out in the night into the valley, &amp; I wil there pray vnto God that he may reueile vnto mee whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shall commit their sinnes, and when he wil reward them with punishment for their iniquities, and that I may shew it there vnto thee: &amp; then maist thou go forth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all thine armie, for there shalbe none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shal resist thee.

For these things haue bin spoken and declared vnto me, according to my foreknowledge, &amp; by the prouidence of God. And for so much as God is displeased with them, he hath sent me to tell the same.</p>
                     <p>These her wordes so greatly pleased Olophernes, &amp; all his seruants, that they marueiled much at hir wisedom, &amp; said one to another: There is not such a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, both for beauty of face, fauour in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And Olophernes being far in loue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her beautie, said vnto Iudith, God hath done well in this, to send thee before the people, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou maiest giue them into our hands, &amp; bring destruction vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> despise my L.

and charged them that they should prepare &amp; appoint her diet of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same meates and wines from his owne table. But notwithstanding, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth tolde the king, I may not as nowe eate of thy meates and drinkes, (quoth she,) least there shoulde bee an offence founde to be committed by mee, and so I displease my God: therefore giue no charge concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my dyet: for I can suffice my selfe with the thinges that I haue heere brought with mee in my scrippe and bottelles. Yea quoth O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophernes, but what if these thinges w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast brought shoulde fayle thee, howe shoulde wee giue thee the like, for there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as thy soule liueth (my Lorde) thine handemaide shall not spend all those things that I haue, before the Lord woorke by mine hande the thing that I haue determined, and deuised.</p>
                     <p>Then his seruauntes brought her into the tent whereas he had appoynted her. And as shee was gone in, shee desired of Olopher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that shee might haue leaue to goe forth by night, and before day to praye, and to make intercession vnto the Lorde. And being licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of Olophernes so to doe, who commaunded his chaumberlaines and garde that shee shoulde goe out and in at her pleasure to pray vnto God, and that they shoulde not stay her. Shee went into the tent, and there slept with her maide vntill midnight, and then arose at the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning watch, and went in the night season foorth of the campe into the valley of Bethulia, and there washed her selfe in a fountayne, euen in the water by the campe, and when shee came out, shee prayed vnto the Lorde God of Israel, that he woulde direct her way, and prosper her enterprise, to the exaltation and deliuerance of her brethren his people.</p>
                     <p>And so shee returned, and remained pure, fasting all day in her tent, vntill she eate her meat in the euening. And thus did Iudith remayne pure and cleane in the campe, and vsed in the night season to go out and in to wash her selfe, and to pray for the space of three nightes together: and in the fourth day, it came to passe that Olophernes (by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence) made a great feast or supper to his owne seruaunts onely that attended about his person: but called none of them to the banquet that had the affayres of warres in hand. And sayde to Bagoas his Eunuch or chamberlaine, goe thy wayes, &amp; by counsel perswade this Hebrewes woman Iudith which is with thee, that shee bee willing to come and eate and drinke with vs, and to consent to keepe companie with vs: For it were a shame for vs, to let such a woman alo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

her, and if wee doe not allure her she will mocke vs, and laugh vs to scorne, that shee were come from vs vnmedled withall. Then went Bagoas vnto Iudith, and saide, let not this faire maid and good daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee afraide, or make difficultie to goe in to my Lorde Olophernes, that shee may bee honoured in his presence, and to drinke wine with him ioyfully, and bee meerie with him, and to bee intreated as one of the daughters of the children of Assur, which remaine in the house of Nabuchadnezar. Then Iudith being right glad of that oportunitie, perceiuing in her heart, that the Lorde by his mightie prouidence had wrought this as a meane for her, the better to bring her deuice to passe to his glorie and her peoples deliuerance, and to the enemies ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: answered Bagoas, &amp; said: Who am I that I should now gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say my Lord? Surely whatsoeuer pleaseth him, and seemeth best vnto him, I will doe it speedilie, yea, it shall bee my ioye vnto the day of my death, and I shall thinke it well doone as long as I liue, to gratifie him in any thing I may.</p>
                     <p>So Iudith arose, and tyred her selfe with her gay apparrell, and with the ornaments of women, and her maide Abra went and spred the skinnes (which shee had receiued of Bagoas for her daylie vse, to sitte and eate vpon) all along on the grounde, ouer against Olophernes Tent, and for her mistres to goe vpon. Nowe when the messenger had brought Iudith to Olophernes, and she sate downe before him, his heart was presently rauished with her, and his spirite by and by was moued and rauished with her beautie, insomuch that he brent in desire towardes her, and coueted her companie greatlie: for hee had waited for the time to deceiue her, from the first day that euer he had seene her, and hee saide vnto her, drinke nowe and sitte downe, and be merie with vs, for thou hast founde fauour before me. My Lord (quoth Iudith) I will drinke nowe and reioyce, for my minde is merier to day then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it was in all my life, and because my state is exalted nowe more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer it was since I was borne: and with that shee called her maide A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra, and tooke of her the victuals she brought and had prepared for her, and did eate and drinke cheerefully with Olophernes. Then Olo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes reioyced so greatly in Iudith, because of her company, that he drank much more wine at that time then euer he had drunk at anie one time before since he was borne.</p>
                     <p>Now when the euening was come, and it was late in the night, his seruants made hast euery man to depart to his lodging, and Bagoas

his Chamberlain, shut the chamber dores and dismissed those that were present from the presence of his Lorde, and they went all to their beds, for they were all werie (because the feast had beene long) and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden with wine. So Iudith in the yeere of the worlde 3496. being left all alone in Olophernes tent, and Olophernes himselfe lying stretched along vpon his bed, all drunken and filled with wine, of very drunkennesse falling fast a sleepe: she commaunded her maide Abra to goe and stande without the tent dore and waite for her comming foorth: and so euerie bodie being gone foorth of her presence, and not one left in the chamber little or great, but her selfe and Olophernes that was fast a sleepe: she standing by his bed side, fell downe on her knees, &amp; there secretly in her heart (her lips only a little mouing) made her praiers with teares vnto God for his helpe, &amp; that he would streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then her in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her enterprise, as appeareth in the first Lamp. Pag. 43.</p>
                     <p>And her prayers ended, she went &amp; tooke downe his sword or fauchin hung on the post at his beds head, &amp; drew it, &amp; then went and tooke hold of Olophernes by the haire of his head, and beseeching God euen then in that houre to strengthen her, shee smote twise vpon his necke with all her might, &amp; cut of his head at two blowes quite from his bodie, and rowled his dead body downe from the bed, and pulled downe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pillers. And immediatly she gat her forth &amp; deliuered the head of Olophernes vnto her handmaid Abra, and bad her put it in her scrip or wallet of meat, &amp; so they twaine went foorth together, as thogh they had gone after their accustomed maner to pray, &amp; so passing by the host, &amp; comming about through the valley neere vnto the gate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Bethulia: She cried a far off to the watchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Open now the gates, for God euen our God is with vs (quoth she) &amp; hath shewed his power yet in Israel, &amp; his force against his enemies as he hath done eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this day.

So when Achior came out of the house of Ozias with whom he remained in his banishment, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith said vnto him: The God of Israel vnto whom thou gauest witnes, that he woulde be auenged of his enemies, euen by his might through my hand hath smitten of the head of the vnfaithfull, &amp; that thou maiest see that it is so, beholde this is the head of Olophernes, which in his presumptuous pride despised the God of Israel, &amp; threatned thee with destruction, saying: When the people of Israel are taken, I shal cause thee also to be stricken with the sworde, and slaine among them. And when Achior saw the head of Olophernes in a certain mans hands in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> assembly of the people, he fell downe on his face to the grounde, for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry anguish and feare, so that his spirites failed, and he sorowed withall. But after that he was come againe to himselfe, and was taken vp, hee fell downe againe at Iudiths feete, reuerenced her, and praised her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, saying: Blessed art thou of thy God, in all the Tabernacles of Iacob or Iuda: for all the people &amp; nations that heare of thy name, shall be astonished, and praise the God of Israel because of thee. Now therfore tell mee all the things that thou hast done in these daies. Then Iudith declared vnto Achior in the midst of the people, all that she had done from the day that shee went foorth, vntill that present houre shee spake vnto them. And when she had done, the people reioyced with a great voyce, and made a noyse of gladnesse through all the Citie. And Achior also, seeing the power of God, and all thinges that he had done for Israel, fell from his Heathenish religion, and beleeued in God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly, and put his trust in God only, and let himselfe be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1693:96"/>
head out on the wall, and euery man tooke his weapon, and went foorth and did as Iudith bad them. When the spies sawe that the Bethulians came out against them, with such an horrible crie, they ran to Olophernes tent, and willed Bagoas to goe and awake Olopher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes their Lorde, saying in contemptible wise of the Israelites: The slaues and mice are bolde to creepe out of their holes, and dare prouoke vs vnto battaile to their owne destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for euer. Then Bagoas went and knocked hard at the tent dore of Olophernes, thinking he had bin a sleepe with Iudith, but because none answered, he opened the dore &amp; went into the chamber, and finding his bodie headlesse, cast vppon the ground weltring in blood: he cried with a loude voyce, with weeping and mourning, and a mightie crie, and rent his garments. After he went into the tent of Iudith, where she vsed to remaine, and when hee found not her there, then he leaped out like a mad man, and ran to the hostes, and cryed, saying: These slaues haue committed wickednesse, one woman of the Hebrues hath brought shame vpon the house of king Nabuchodonozer. For he holde, Olophernes lyeth vpon the grounde without an head. When the captaines of the Assyrians armie heard these wordes, they rent their coates, and their heartes were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully troubled, insomuch as there was a lamentable crie, and a very great noyse hard through the campe. And being astonished at the thing, for feare and trembling durst not abide: but altogether amased, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and out of order, fled euery man with as much speede as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to saue himselfe, and left all their munition and victuals behinde them. Which when the Israelites and Bethulians saw, they earnestly pursued the chase, and followed hard vpon the Assyrians, so that they discomfited them, and slue them downe right in all quarters where they went, and then returned to the spoile of their enemies, and were greatly inriched therewith.</p>
                     <p>After this notable victorie, Ioachim the high Priest at Ierusalem hearing of this mightie worke of God, by the hand of Iudith, came w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Auncients of Israel that dwelt in Ierusalem, to confirme the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites that God had shewed to Israel, and to see Iudith and salute her. And when she came out vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they began al to blesse &amp; praise her, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one voyce and accord, saying: Thou art the worship &amp; exaltation of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem: thou art the great glory &amp; honor of Israel: thou art the greate ioy, &amp; reioysing of our people &amp; nation: because thou hast done all these things, namely by thine owne hand, &amp; thine heart is comforted, and for
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1693:97"/>
that thou hast loued cleanlinesse and chastitie, and hast knowen no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but thine owne husband, and because thou hast done much good to Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and God is pleased therewith: therefore hath the hand of the Lord comforted thee, and blessed be thou of the almightie Lord for euer: and all the people said, Amen, amen.</p>
                     <p>And when the people had slaine all their enemies, and for the space of thirtie daies had gathered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spoyles in the Camps of the Assyrians, &amp; brought it to Bethulia: they gaue vnto Iudith by whom God had so mightily wrought their deliuerance, all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gold, siluer, precious stones, clothing, bedding, ornaments &amp; stuffe whatsoeuer, that was Olopher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; belonged vnto him: which shee tooke gratefully, and loaded her Mules &amp; chariots therewith, redie to conuey it home to her house. But before she went, all the women of Israel came together to see her, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her in great honor, reuerence, and estimation, &amp; blessed her, and made a ioyfull daunce among them for her: and shee tooke braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in her hand, and gaue also to the women &amp; maidens y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were with her. Then all the people reioiced, both women and maides, and young people with Pipes &amp; Harpes, with such ioy as neuer the like was seen. And they crowned her also with Oliue branches, &amp; Abra her maid that was with her, and she went before the people in a daunce, leading all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> women: &amp; all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men of Israel folowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their armour, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> crownes and with songs of praise to God in their mouthes. Yea, Iudith herself began a song of prayse vnto the Lord, for the victorie and deliuerance of his people by her hands, as appeareth in the first Lampe. Pag. 44.</p>
                     <p>After this victorie and triumph, all the people went to Ierusalem, to worship the Lorde with praise &amp; thansgiuing: and when the women were purified, they offered all their whole burnt offerings, their free offerings or vowes, and their gifts or promised sacrifice, for ioy that God had wrought for his people, so mightily by the hand of a woman. Iudith also her selfe offered all the stuffe of Olophernes, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had giuen her, and gaue the Canopie which she had taken from his bed, for an oblation to the Lord. So the people reioyced as the vse is, by reason of the victory, for the space of three moneths, and Iudith remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them in Ierusalem by the Sanctuarie. And after this, euery one returned home to his owne house &amp; inheritance. And Iudith went to Bethulia, &amp; remained in her owne possession, &amp; was for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time right honorably taken in all the countrey &amp; land of Israel. Unto her vertue also was chastitie ioyned: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although many desired her, yet

she neuer knew man, nor companied w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any all the dayes of her life, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Manasses her husband was dead, and gathered to his people. But on the high solemne feast dayes, she went out with great worship &amp; increased more &amp; more in honor, &amp; waxed old in her husbands house, where when she had been a widow three yeeres &amp; foure moneths, was become an 105. yeres old. After that she had made her maide Abra free, and distributed her goods to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were neerest of her kinred, to her husband &amp; her, she died in Bethulia, &amp; there was most honorably buried beside her husband. Whose death the Iewes or people of Israel lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with mourning vii. daies together: &amp; euery yeere solemnized y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day wherin she got the victorie, as a holy day to be kept for euer amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g their fastiuall daies.

                     <p>Shee was the eldest daughter of Laban, the sonne of Nahor Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams brother, and sister to Rahel, but being bleare eyed, or squint eyed, shee was nothing so faire and beautifull as her sister Rahel was: yet when her sister Rahel (for whom Iacob serued seuen yeres) should haue been giuen vnto him in marriage, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same night after the wedding feast kept by Rahel her father, to prefer his eldest daughter in marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest, especially being somwhat deformed, couered his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Leahs face with a vaile in signe of chastitie &amp; shamefastnesse, as the maner of virgins, or young maried wiues then was, &amp; so in the darke &amp; in steede of her sister Rahel brought her to bed to Iacob, who lay with her, and so she preuented her sister Rahel in marriage, &amp; became Iacobs first wife, &amp; this was in the yeere of the worlde. 2252. And her father gaue his maid Zilpa to Leah, to be her waiting maid &amp; seruant. Which deceit in Laban caused Iacob to serue seuen yeres more for Rahel her sister. But when the Lord saw that Lea was despised, &amp; not so well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of her husband Iacob as her sister was: shee in her affliction had recourse vnto God by prayer: &amp; because children are a great cause of mutuall loue betweene man wife, he heard her prayer, and made defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Lea fruitfull, &amp; faire Rahel barren; so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same yeere Leah con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued &amp; bare a sonne, &amp; called his name Ruben, saying: Because the Lord hath looked vpon my tribulation &amp; giuen me a childe, now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my husband will loue me. And the next yeere, being the yere of the world 2253. she conceiued againe &amp; bare another sonne, &amp; called his name Symeon, saying: because the Lord hath heard that I was hated, therefore he hath giuen me this sonne also. And in the yere 2254. shee conceiued againe the third time, &amp; bare a sonne, &amp; called his name Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, saying; Now at this time will my husband keepe mee commpanie, because I haue borne him three sonnes. Lastly, in the yeere of the world 2255. she conceiued &amp; bare him another sonne, &amp; called his name Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, saying: Now, will I praise the Lord, &amp; so she left bearing. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when she saw that for her fruitfulnes she was enuied of her bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren sister Rahel, &amp; that she her selfe also now had left bearing, then shee gaue Zilpah her maid vnto her husband Iacob to wife, who bare him a sonne, &amp; Leah called his name Gad, saying: God doth increase me with

a company, or multitude of children. Again, Zilpah her maid conceiued and bare another sonne, whose name Leah called Asshur, saying: Ah, blessed am I, for the daughters will blesse me. After this in the yeere of the world. 2256. it chanced that Ruben her eldest sonne in the time of wheat haruest went out into the field, &amp; found (certaine hearbes called) Mandrakes (whose roote hath a certaine likenes of the figure of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) and brought them home vnto his mother Lea. And when Rahel her si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster heard thereof, she went to Lea her sister, &amp; desired her to giue her of her sonnes Mandrakes: but Lea vnwilling so to do, answered &amp; said to her sister Rahel: Is it not enough that thou hast taken away mine hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but wouldst take away my sonnes Mandrakes also? Wel (quoth Rahel) let him sleepe with thee this night for thy sonnes Mandrakes. And so Iacob co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of the field at euening: Lea went out to meet him, and said: Come in vnto me &amp; lie with me this night, for I haue bought &amp; paid for thee with my sonnes Mandrakes. So Iacob did, and God heard Leah, and she conceiued by him that night, &amp; bare vnto Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob the fift sonne, &amp; called his name Issachar, saying: God hath giuen me my reward, because I gaue my maide to my husband. In which wordes she offended, because in steede of acknowledging her fault, shee boasteth there, as if God had rewarded her therfore. After that, in the yeere of the world 2257. Lea conceiued againe, and bare Iacob the sixt sonne of her owne bodie, &amp; called his name Zebulim, praysing God and saying: God hath indued me with a good dowry, now will mine hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band dwell with me, because I haue borne him sixe sonnes. Last of all, in the yeere of the world 2258. she conceaued &amp; brought foorth Iacob a daughter, whose name she called Dinah. Now when Iacob was to depart away from Laban, with his wiues Leah &amp; Rahel, &amp; such goods and cattell as God had blessed him with in his seruice for recompence of his true seruice: Iacob perceiuing Labans children to murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Iacob, as though he had inriched himselfe of their fathers sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to their impouerishment, called his wife Leah and Rahel, &amp; tolde them of that discourtesie, and what the Lord had reueled vnto him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his departure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Laban. Leah &amp; Rahel said vnto Iacob their husbande: Haue we any more portion in our fathers house? doth not he count vs as strangers? for he hath solde vs, in that hee hath giuen vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence of thy seruice, which is a kinde of sale, &amp; hath eaten vp and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed our portions &amp; money, therfore all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riches which God hath taken from our father is ours, and our childrens. Nowe then

whatsoeuer God hath put in thy minde to doe, doe it. Whereuppon Iacob with his two wiues Leah and Rahel, departed from their father Laban, and returned towardes their owne countrie: and hauing deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his familie into order: Leah his wife and her children were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, next the maides and their children.

These fiue daughters went all together before Moses
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1693:100"/>
to the Tabernacle of the congregation, and there in the presence of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazar the Priest, and Iosua the sonne of Nun, and before the Princes and all the assembly, spake for them selues, and saide: Our father dyed in the wildernesse, and was not among the assembly of those wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men that were assembled against the Lorde in the company and rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram: but dyed in his sinne (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as all men die, for as much as they are sinners) and had no sonnes, but vs his fiue daughters. Wherefore, that the name of our father bee not taken away from among his familie, because hee hath no sonne, giue vs a possession among the brethren of our father. Then Moses perceiuing their request reasonable, and yet hard for him to decide, for as yet there had not hapned any such matter, brought their cause before the Lord to be iudged, and to know what hee should determine thereof, as he did hard matters. And the Lorde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Moses, saying: The daughters of Zilophehad speake right. Thou shalt therefore giue them a possession to inherite emong their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers brethren: and shalt turne the inheritance of their father, and suffer it to descende vnto them. Also thou shalt make this law of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes from hencefoorth among the children of Israel, that if a man die &amp; haue no sonne, then shal he turne his inheritance to his daughter: And if hee haue no daughter, yee shall giue his inheritance vnto his brethren: and if he haue no brethren, ye shall giue his inheritance vnto his fathers brethren: and if his father haue no brethren, yee shall giue his inheritance vnto his next kinsman of his family, and he shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse it. And this shalbe vnto the children of Israel a law of iudgement or an ordinance, finall decree, or presidence to all posteritie to iudge by in like case of the discents of inheritance lineall or colateral, to is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue male or female for euer, as I haue commanded thee. <hi>Num. 26.33. 27.1. &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1693:101"/>

Then Moses, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing in deede that the tribe of Manasses could not haue continued, if the inheritance, which was the maintenance thereof, should haue beene abalienated by the marriage of these daughters to other tribes: said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ten tribes, or the children of Israel thus, The tribe of the sonnes of Ioseph haue said well, and moued a good doubt. This therefore is the thing that the Lorde hath yet further commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehads marriage &amp; inheritance. They shalbe wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes to whom they think best, onely to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry: so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel, remoue from tribe to tribe, for euery one of the children of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el shall ioyne himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. And euery daughter that possesseth any inheritance, for lacke of issue male, of the tribe of the children of Israel, shalbe wife vnto one of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may inioy euery man the inheritance of their fathers. Neither shall the inheritance goe about from tribe to tribe: but euery one of the tribes of the children of Israel, shall sticke to his owne inheritance. And as the Lorde comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Moses, so did Mahlah and her sisters, for they were all married vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their fathers brothers sonnes, and became wiues to certaine of the families of the sonnes of Manasses, the sonne of Ioseph, so that their inheritance remained in the tribe of the familie of their father. <hi>Num. 36.</hi>

                     <p>Shee was the blessed and holy virgin and mother of Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, whose parents are not expressed in Scripture by name: but as some thinke, she was the daughter of Heli, otherwise called Ioachim, and of Anna his wife, borne in the yeere of the world 3948. in the daies of Cambalinus, and before the birth of Christ xv. yeeres. But whose daughter soeuer shee was, certaine it is, that both she and her husbande Ioseph came of the princely race, and royall stocke, or linage of king Dauid, and that she was neere cosin to Elizabeth S. John Baptist his mother (as shall appeare) and Marie the wife of Cleophe was her sister also.</p>
                     <p>Nowe this blessed virgin being affianced or betrothed to a certaine good man of her owne stocke and tribe of Iuda, named Ioseph. So it was that before she came to dwell with him, the Angel Gabriel in the yeere of the worlde 4142. being sent of God, came and saluted her, as she was in her house at Nazareth, a Citie of Galilee, saying: Haile, thou that art beloued (orgladnesse be vnto thee which art highly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into fauour, &amp; full of grace) the Lorde is with thee, blessed art thou among women. The Virgin seeing the Angel, was sore abashed and troubled at his wordes, and mused much in her minde, what maner of salutation that should be. Then saide the Angel, Feare nor Marie, for thou hast found fauour with God; for loe, thou shalt conceiue in thy wombe, &amp; beare a sonne, and shalt call his name Iesus, he shalbe great, and shall be called the sonne of the most high. And the Lorde God shall giue vnto him the throne of his father Dauid, and he shall raigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome shalbe none end. Then Marie, because she woulde be resolued of all doubtes, to the ende shee might the more surely imbrace the promise of God, saide vnto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. How shall this be, seeing I knowe no man? The holy Ghoste (quoth the Angell) shall come vpon thee, and the power of the most high shall ouershadowe thee, (and secretly woorke in thee aboue all naturall reason.) Therefore also that holy (and pure) thinge which shall bee borne of thee, shalbe called the sonne of GOD.

And thy cosin Elizabeth she hath also conceiued a sonne in her old age, and this is her sixt moneth, which was called Barren. For with God shall nothing be impossible. Then saide Mary, beholde the handmaide of the Lorde: be it vnto me according to thy worde. So the Angell being departed from her, vpon this shee prepared her selfe with speede to goe and visite her cosin Elizabeth, and comming to Hebron where her cosin dwelt, shee entred into the house of Zacharias, and saluted her cosin Elizabeth his wife: who no sooner heard the salutation of Mary, but the babe myraculously sprang in her belly, &amp; beeing filled presently with the holy Ghoste, she cryed with a loude voice, and saide to Marie, Blessed art thou amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruite of thy wombe is blessed: &amp; whence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth this to me that the mother of my Lorde should come to mee &amp;c? Then Mary beleeuing all these thinges to be performed which were tolde her by the message of the Angell, with a ioyful heart and mind, made a notable song in the praise of God for his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes her, saying: My soule doth magnifie the Lorde, &amp;c. as in the first Lampe of Uirginitie, Page 48. Which song being ended, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with her cosin Elizabeth about three monethes, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to her owne house againe to Nazareth a Citie of Galilee. Where being found with childe of the holy Ghoste as the Angell had saide, before her husband &amp; she came together, &amp; that her husband had taken her home vnto him. Then Ioseph her husband being a iust man, vpright, and fearing God: and therefore suspecting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted fornication before shee was betrothed vnto him, and not willing to make her a publike example, was minded to put her away secretely, and woulde neither retaine her, which by the lawe shoulde be married to another, nor by accusing her, woulde put her to open shame for her fact: But whiles he thought these thinges, beholde the Angell of the Lord appeared to him in a dreame, and by reuelation saide vnto him, Ioseph, thou sonne of Dauid, feare not to take Mary for thy wife, for that which is conceiued in her, is of the holy Ghost, and she shall bring foorth a sonne, and thou shalt call his name Iesus: for he shall saue his people from their sinnes. And all this was done that it might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Esay, 7.14.</hi> saying: Behold, a virgin shalbe with childe &amp; shall beare a sonne, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is by interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs. Then Ioseph being raised from sleepe, did as the Angell of the Lorde had inioyned him, and tooke his wife Marie home vnto him. But

he knew her not till shee had brought forth her first borne sonne, nor at any time euer after.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after it chaunced that Ioseph her husbande went vp from the citie of Nazareth to the lande of Iurie, to a citie called Bethlem: and shee also being great with childe, went with him there to be taxed according to the Emperour Augustus commaundement: because they were of the house and linage of Dauid. And being forced to lie in the stable for lacke of roome in the Inne, her houre came to bee deliuered, &amp; there (she being now about the age of xvi. yeres as it is said) brought forth Christ Iesus the sauiour of the worlde, her first begotten sonne, and wrapped him in swadling clothes, and laide him in a cratch or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: because there was no other roome or conuenient place for them in the Inne: whereby appeareth her pouertie at that time, and their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie both towards her, and her babe, which woulde not pitie a woman in such a case. Which strang, or rather ioyful newes, being by Gods angel reueiled vnto the shepheards in the field, they ran with all hast to Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and there first found both Marie and Ioseph, and the babe laid in the cratch, and when they had seene it they published it first abroad to the world, and all that heard it wondred: but Marie kept all these sayings, and pondered them in her heart. And the Shepheards returned, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God for all that they had heard &amp; seen of our sauiour Christ. And when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eight day was come, they circumcised her child, &amp; his name was called Iesus, as the angell had so named him before he was conceiued. And when the dayes of her purification, after the Law of Moses, were come, she went with her childe Iesus and her husband to Ierusalem, to present him to the Lord, and there according to her pouertie, offred two yong pigions, and a payre of turtle doues for an oblation according to the lawe, for her manchilde that was holy vnto the Lord.

may bee opened. And when shee had performed all thinges at Ierusalem according to the lawe, shee returned with Ioseph her husbande home to the Citie of Nazareth agayne. And being accustomed yeerely she and her husband to goe vp at the feast of Ester to Ierusalem, shee chaunced on a tyme to forget her Sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus behind her, and supposing that he had beene in the company, went a dayes iourney, and sought him among her kinsfolke and acquaintance: But when she could not finde him, she tourned backe to Ierusalem, and there sought him for the space of three dayes, ere she could finde him. At the last she found him out in the temple, sitting in the middes of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, hearing and apposing them with questions, and sayd vnto him: Sonne, why haste thou thus delt with vs? thy father and I haue sought thee with heauy heartes: but he preferring his duetie to God before fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or mother, sayd: how is it that ye sought me? Knowe yee not that I must goe about my fathers businesse? but they vnderstood him not. So hee came, and went home to Nazareth with her, and was subiecte vnto his mother, who kept all these his sayinges in her heart. Another time as she was with her sonne at a marriage feast in Cana, a towne in Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, when the wine fayled at the feast: she tolde her Sonne that they lacked wine, and receiuing his answere meekely, she bad the ministers or seruantes to doe whatsoeuer hee commaunded them.

And when Iesus sawe her, and the Disciple Saint Iohn standing by her whome hee loued: Hee sayde vnto his mother, woman, beholde thy Sonne. Then sayde hee also to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: beholde thy mother, and from that houre the Disciple tooke her home vnto him, and comforted her.

Therfore verily I say vnto you, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer this Ghospel shal be preached thorowe out al the world, this fact which she hath done shal be spoken of in her worthy reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual memorial. Also when Symon the Pharisie, which bad Christ to the feast, saw what Mary had done, he likewise murmured &amp; grudged within himself, &amp; began to doubt of Christ, &amp; to iustify himselfe, &amp; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Mary: saying, if this man were a Prophet, he would surely haue known who &amp; what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this is, which toucheth him: for she is a sinner or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon harlot: but Iesus seeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great faith of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman, &amp; knowing his hypocritical thoughts, prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly put foorth this parable, &amp; said to him: Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I haue so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>what to say to thee: say on master (quoth he) There was (said Christ) a certein creditor had 2. debtors, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one ought him 5. hundred pence, &amp; the other fifty, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had nought to pay, he

them both, which of them therefore thinkest thou wil loue him most, tel me? I suppose (quoth Simon) that he to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he forgaue most, will loue him most. Thou hast iudged truely (said Christ) and with that, turned him to the woman, &amp; said to Simon: Seest thou this woman? I entred into thine house, and thou gauest me no water to my feete, but shee hath washed my feet with teares, and wiped them with the haire of her head. Thou gauest mee no kisse, but shee since the time that I came in, hath not ceassed to kisse my feet. My head with oyle thou diddest not anoint, but shee hath anointed both my head and feete with oyntmente. Wherefore I say vnto thee, many sinnes are forgiuen her: for she lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued much. To whom a litle is forgiuen, he doth loue a litle. And then he turned him to Marie Magdalen, and sayde vnto her, woman, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, and thy fayth hath saued thee, go in peace: and presently there went out of her seuen diuelles or foule spirites, to the admiration of all that sate at the table. Then Marie feeling her self much bounde to Christ, which had forgiuen her so many sinnes, and cast out of her so many diuels, fel in so great loue of Christ, that al her whole meditation and studie euer after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time, was only vpon him. Insomuch that to acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great benefites which shee had receiued of him, and to shew her perseuerance in thankfulnes and knowledge of Christ, shee diligently followed Christ with Ioanna the wife of Chuza, and Susanna, and many other women, whom Christ had healed together with her of their euil spirits, and infirmities: and ministred vnto Christ of her substance. And when her sister Martha receiued Christe into her house to meate, and was cumbred about muche seruing of Christ at the table: Marie Magdalen (chusing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better part) sate at Iesus feete all the while and heard his preaching. Also when her brother Lazarus was dead and laide in the graue, and Iesus was comming to her sisters Marthas house to rayse Lazarus agayne to life: so soone as her sister Martha called her secretly, and tolde her that her maister Christ was comming, and asked for her, shee to declare her affection and reuerence that shee bare to Christ, arose with speede and went to meete him: and when shee was come where Iesus was and sawe him, shee fell downe at his feet, &amp; wept, saying vnto him, Lord, if thou hadst bin here my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had not bin dead. And when Iesus saw her weepe, for very compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> felt our miseries, &amp; suffered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lik, he groned in spirit, was troubled in himselfe, &amp; wept also together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her for sorrow, as ye may read

more in the storie of her sister Martha. Moreouer when Iesus suffered his passion, this Marie Magdalen with Marie the virgine and mother of Christ, and Marie the wife of Cleophas, and with other women, who had followed Iesus from Galilee to Ierusalem, ministring vnto him, first stood a farre off, and behelde howe he was crucified, and afterward came and stood by the crosse to see the ende, and when hee was taken down by Ioseph Aremathea, and wrapt in linnen clothes to be buried: shee with Marie Ioses mother sate ouer against the sepulchre, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde where he shoulde be layde, and so returned home to buy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare odours and sweete oyntments to anoynt his body, and rested the Sabboath day according to the commaundement: And the morrowe after the Sabbath day, when shee came with sweete oyntmentes, very early in the morning before sunne rising to the sepulchre, thinking to haue anointed and embalmed the body of Iesus in his graue, and sawe the stone taken away from the tombe: shee with feare and great ioy at the Angelles commaundement, ranne to Peter and Iohn, and tolde them saying, they haue taken the Lord out of the sepulchre, &amp; we knowe not where they haue laide him: But Peter and Iohn not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her words, ran both of them to the graue to trie the matter, &amp; fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her wordes true, they returned backe againe to their companies, leauing Marie standing at the graue weeping for the loue she bare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iesus. And as she wept &amp; bowed her self to looke into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue again, as one not satisfied w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> seeking Iesus her Lord, behold she saw two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels sitting in white clothes, who said vnto her, woman, why weepest thou? Oh quoth shee, they haue taken away my Lord, and I knowe not where they haue laid him. And turning her selfe about, shee sawe Iesus standing, but knew not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was he, to whom he said: Woman, why we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest thou? whom doest thou seeke? she supposing it had bin the gardner, said, sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, &amp; I will fet him. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iesus said vnto her (Marie:) with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she turned her selfe, and saide vnto him, (Rabbony,) which is to say, Maister, and fell downe to the grounde to haue kissed his feete. But to withdrawe her from beeing too much addicted to his corporall presence, and to teache her to lift vp her minde by faith into heauen, where onely after his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention he remayneth: Iesus said vnto her, Touch me not, for I am not yet asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to my father: but go to my brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; tel them that I ascende to my father &amp; to your father: to my God &amp; your God.

And shee being a very godly &amp; deuout woman, who with Marie Magdalen amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other women followed Iesus from Galilee to Ierusalem, ministred vnto him of her substaunce. And when he was led to be crucified, she folowed him also lamenting and bewailing him, vnto whom Iesus saide, Yee daughters of Ierusalem, weep not for me, but weepe for your selues, &amp; for your children: for behold the dayes will come when men shall say, blessed are the barren, &amp; the wombes that neuer bare, &amp; the pappes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neuer gaue sucke.

And when Christe was crucified, she with Marie Magdalen among the rest of the women, stood a far off &amp; beheld him suffer his passion, &amp; to see, what would become of him: and after his death, drewe nere, &amp; stood euer against his sepulchre where hee should be buried: &amp; afer went home to prepare odors, &amp; came the morow after the Sabboth very early to embalme the bodie of Iesus, but found him not there, for he was risen &amp; gone, &amp; so was a witnesse of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: as ye may read in the story of Marie Magdelen. <hi>Mat. 27.56. 28.1.

And Iesus perceiuing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she had smot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the principall, which was to heare Gods word, answered and sayd vnto her: Martha, Martha, thou carest and art troubled about manye things: but verily, one thing is needeful.

                     <p>And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her brother Lazarus fel sicke in Bethynia, she and her sister Marie sent word therof vnto Iesus, saying: behold, he who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou louest is sick, come therfore &amp; heale him.

But Michal loued Dauid her husband so faithfully, that her father could not haue his wicked purpose that way to take effect.

house and to stay him there in his owne bedde: God so moueth the heart of Michal against the tyrant her father, and to fauour her husbande, that she knowing of that conspiracie went and tolde Dauid therof, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If thou saue not thy selfe this night, to morow thou shalt be slaine: wherefore to saue the life of Dauid her husband, shee let him downe at a backe windowe, that he escaped, and layde an image in his bedde, with a pillow vnder his head stuffed with Goates haire, and couered it with a cloth. And when her fathers blooddie messengers came into her house in the morning, and asked for Dauid: Michal said he was sicke, the cruell messengers thinking to haue carried Dauid bedde and all to the king, that he himselfe might slay him, as he commaunded, went into Dauids chamber, and when they came there and founde nothing els in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bed but a block, they were ashamed to be so mocked, &amp; so retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Saul &amp; told him.

Finally, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dauid came dauncing before the Arke of God in his shirt or linnen Ephod to the citie of Dauid, it chaunced Michal to looke out at a window, &amp; beholding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king her husband how he leaped &amp; daunced before the Arke, she (like a worldling not able to

comprehend the motions of Gods spirite that moued him, and zeale of Dauid the childe of God,) began to despise him in her heart: and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him after all thinges were done comming home to blesse and pray for his owne house, as he had done before for the people, she interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him greatly and sayd, O how glorious was the king of Israel this day, which was vncouered to day, or naked in the eyes of the maydens of his seruantes, as a foole vncouereth himselfe. But Dauid, whom no worldlie affection caused so to doe, but onely the zeale that he bare to Gods glorie, rebuked Michal his wife saying: It was before the Lorde which chose me rather then thy father and all his house, and made me ruler of his people, therefore did I play and daunce before the Lorde: yea, and I will yet be more vile then thus, and will bee lowe in myne owne sight, and of the verye same mayde seruauntes, which thou hast spoken of, shall I be had in honour.

And seeing Pharaos daughter called Memphetica, take him out of the water, which was in the yeere of the world 2434. she ran to her and sayd, shall I goe and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women to nurse the child, and she said, goe: wherevpon she went and called her owne mother Iochebed, who came and tooke Moses, &amp; so by Gods prouidence she nursed her owne childe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God thus maruellously had preserued to bee a notable member of his Churche.

what hath the Lord spoken but onely by Moses? hath he not spoken also by vs? Which her murmuring, Moses beeyng a very meeke &amp; gentle man, gently bare: but the Lord beyng therewith highly displeased and very angry, did therefore smite Myriam with a Leaprosie as white as snowe, in the yeere of the worlde 2516. Then Moses partly for pittie to see his sister in such a lothsome case, and partly at the earnest request and intercession of Aaron his brother, who saide to Moses: Alas my Lorde I beseech thee lay not the sinne vpon vs which we haue foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed, and wherein we haue sinned. Let her not I pray thee be as a childe dead, of whom the fleshe is halfe consumed when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of his mothers wombe, hauing as it were but skinne &amp; bone. Moses besought the Lorde for his sister saying: O Lorde I beseeche thee heale her nowe: but the Lord made him aunsweare saying, if her father in his anger and displeasure had spit in her face, shoulde she not haue beene ashamed seuen dayes? Let her be shut out of the host seuen dayes, and after she shalbe receiued. So Miriam was shut out of the host seuen dayes as the Lorde commaunded, and the people remoued not till Miriam was restored and receiued in againe into the host.

way in her iourney: And when shee sawe they had gone a good way with her, and coueted not to returne from her, shee saide vnto them: Goe nowe my daughters, and returne eche of you vnto your mothers house, and the Lorde deale as kindly with you, as yee haue dealt with the dead men my sonnes, and with mee their sorowfull mother. And the Lorde graunt that you may finde rest eyther of you in the house of her husband, and so kissed them to haue bid them farewell. But when she saw that they wept and would not depart from her, she sayde vnto them agayne, returne my daughters I pray you, for what cause will yee goe with me? Are there anie moe children within my wombe to bee your husbandes? Turne againe therefore I say, and goe your way for I am too olde to haue an husband. And if I should say, I had hope of children, or if I had an husband this night, or had already borne sonnes: Woulde yee tarrie for them till they were growen of age? and refrayne from taking of husbandes so long? No not so my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it greeueth mee much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me. Then they wept altogether, and Orpha kissed her mother in lawe and tooke her leaue, and returned into her owne lande of Moab agayne. But because it was Gods woonderfull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that Ruth shoulde become one of his housholde, shee abode still with Naomy. But Naomy did all that shee could to perswade her like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to depart and returne with her sister saying: beholde thy sister in law is gone backe vnto her people and vnto her Gods, returne thou also after her. But when Naomy saw that for no entreaty Ruth would depart from her, but was stedfastly mynded to goe on with her, she left speaking vnto her. And so when they came to Bethlehem Iuda, which was about the beginning of barley haruest or in April, where when her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming was noysed abroad, the women of the citie which saw Naomy (knowing her to come of a great familie, and to haue been of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation when she dwelt among them) said one to another, is not this Naomy? Naomy saide shee, call me not Naomy, that is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: but call me Mara that is bitter, for the almighty hath geuen mee much bitternes. I went out full, and the Lorde hath brought me againe emptie. Why then call yee me Naomy, seeing the Lord hath humbled me, and the almighty hath brought me vnto aduersitie? And so Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy remayned in Bethleem Iuda, &amp; her daughter in law Ruth with her: where shee liued poorely by the corne that Ruth gleamed for her sustenaunce in the fieldes of Booz her husbande Elimelechs kinsman:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1693:109"/>
and when Ruth brought home the corne and tolde her where shee had it, she praysed God and said: blessed bee hee that knew thee, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the Lord, for hee ceaseth not to doe good to vs that are nowe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and to our husband and children when they were aliue, and are now dead. The man Booz is neere kinne vnto vs and of our affinitie, therefore this now is my counsell vnto thee my daughter, whose rest I ought to seeke, by prouiding thee an husbande, with whom thou mayest liue quietly, that thou mayest prosper.

And when he shall sleepe, marke the place where he layeth him down, and when he is fast a sleepe, goe priuily and vncouer his feete, and laye thee downe at his feete, and he shall tell thee what thou shalt doe. So Ruth departed &amp; followed her counsel, &amp; did in euery thing as Naomy had her: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ruth came home againe in the morning, &amp; Naomy perceiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Booz had not taken Ruth to his wife as she hoped, shee was somewhat astonied &amp; said, Who art thou, my daughter Ruth? &amp; when Ruth tolde her what entertainment she had, Naomy said, sit still my daughter vntill thou know how the thing will fall out, for the man will not be in rest, vntill he haue finished y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter with thee this day. And as she said, so it came to passe, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very same day Booz took Ruth to be his wife, by whom God gaue vnto Naomy a sonne, at whose birth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> women said vnto Naomy: Blessed be the Lorde which hath not lefte thee this day without a kinsman, to haue a name in Israel, &amp; to leaue a continuall posterity, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shal bring thy life againe, &amp; cherish thine old age: for thy daughter in law which loueth thee hath borne vnto him, &amp; she is better vnto thee then seuen or many sonnes.

For wee haue hearde howe the Lorde dryed vp the water of the redde sea before you, when yee came out of Egypt, and what ye did vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two kings of the Ammonites that were on the other side Iordan, vnto Seon and to Og whom ye vtterly destroyed, and when we heard it, our hearts did faint, and there remayned no more courage in any of vs, because of you, for the Lord your God, he is the God of heauen aboue, and in earth beneath. Nowe therefore, I pray you, sweare vnto me by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, that as I haue shewed you mercie, you will also shewe mercie vnto my fathers house, and geue me a true token, that yee will saue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue my father and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they haue, and that yee will deliuer our soules from death.</p>
                     <p>And the men aunswered her and sayde, we warrant thee in paine of our liues, and sweare vnto you that if yee vtter not this our businesse, we (when the Lord hath geuen vs the Land) will deale mercifully and truely with thee and thy fathers house and kinred, as thou hast reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1693:111"/>
Then Rahab dwelling well for that purpose, let these two men down by a corde through a backe window in her house ouer the towne wall, and sayd vnto them: Goe you into the mountaynes which are neere vnto the citie, least the pursuers meete with you, and there hyde your selues three dayes, vntill the pursuers be returned, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward may yee goe your way safely. And the men thanking her for her curtesie towards them, sayde vnto her: We shalbe blamelesse and discharged of this our othe, which thou hast made vs sweare, if thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est performe this condition following, that we shall make, for so shalte thou and thine be deliuered, namely, the condition is this beholde thou shalt bynde this corde of red threed, wherewith wee are let downe, in this windowe, and shalt bring thy father and thy mother, thy brethren, and all thy fathers houshold home to thee, that when we come into the land, we may by this signe and token of the red threed hanging in the wyndow know thy house. And whosoeuer then doth goe out of thine house into the streete, he shalbe guilty of his owne death, and we guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of our othe: but who soeuer shal keepe within thine house, his blood shall be on our heades, if any hand violently touch him: this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition if yee keepe, yee shalbe all safe as we haue promised: but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise if yee vtter these our secretes or condition to others by side, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they likewise should thinke to escape our handes together with you by this meanes: then at your owne perils be it, for we will then be quyte of the othe and promise, which thou hast made vs to sweare vnto thee. Wel (quoth Rahab) according to your words and condition so be it. So she sent them away, who hid themselues in the mountaines 3. dayes, and when they were gone, she bound the red threed or scarlet coloured corde, whereby she let them downe about the mallines of the window, and went and gathered her father, her brethren, friends, and kinred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her house to be preserued therein in the day of the destruction of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> city Iericho, as the men had promised and condicioned with her.</p>
                     <p>Now shortly after when Iosua w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his host came &amp; besieged y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> city Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo, before he destroyed the city, hee being mindefull of Rahabs good turne done vnto his 2. men, gaue his souldiers and men a great charge concerning Rahab by name, saying: The citie is appointed of God as an execrable thing to be destroyed with all that are therein, onelie Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab the harlot shall liue, shee and all that are with her in her house. For shee hidde and preserued the two messengers that wee sente to spyie out the lande. And after, when by the handes of GOD
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1693:112"/>
onlie without mans force the walles of Iericho fell downe, and Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sua entred into the citie to take the spoyle and kill man, woman, and childe, still remembred Rahab, and saide vnto his two men whom shee preserued: Goe into the harlots house, and bring out thence the woman Rahab and al that she hath, as yee sware vnto her. So the young men that were the two spyes, went directly to Rahabs house by meanes of the red threed that houng at her window for a signe, and brought out Rahab, her father and her mother, her brethren, her familie, and al that she had, and put them without the host of Israel, because it was not lawfull for Rahab and her companie being straungers to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Israelites till they were purified: and when Rahab and hers were thus according to promise carried out of the citie and preserued aliue: Iosua set the citie Iericho a fire, and burnt vp all therein. So Iosua saued Rahab the harlot, her fathers housholde, and all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she had, because she had hid the messengers which he had sent to spie out y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> land, or rather as Saint Paule saith, By faith this harlot Rahab perished not with them which obeyed not when she had receyued the spies peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie. Wherin appeareth the great mercie of God, that in so great &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a destruction, he would vouchsafe to draw such a miserable sinner as this Rahab the harlot was, voyd of all good works, onely by faith to repent, and confesse his name, as shee did to both hers and others sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation for her sake. For after this, shee being a Gentile or Heathen, dwelt in Israel, and there was married to Salmon Prince of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tribe of Iuda, and bare vnto him a sonne called Booz, who after tooke to wife Ruth, the Moabitish woman another Gentile, of whom came O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, Iesse, Dauid, and so lineally Christ, and all to saue both Iewes and Gentiles. Blessed bee his name therefore. <hi>Iosua 2.6.7.22.25. Matth. 1.5.

                     <p>Shee was the youngest daughter of Laban the sonne of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor, and being a very fayre and beautifull mayden borne in Haran, disdayned not to keepe her fathers sheepe. And as she came with her fathers sheepe to water them at the well, it was her chaunce there to meete with Iacob the sonne of Isaak and Rebecca, and her
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1693:112"/>
fathers nephewe, who after some curtesie shewed towards her in hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her to water her sheepe, kissed Rahel and tooke acquayntaunce of her, as his neere kinswoman: wherevpon she ranne and tolde her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Laba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who presently went out and fetcht Iacob home, and there af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intertaynment made, retayned Iacob in his seruice, where in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse Iacob fell in loue with Rahel, and offered to serue her father se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeeres for her to be his wife: vnto whom Laban made as willing a promise saying, It is better that I geue her thee whiche art bone of my bones, and flesh my flesh, then that I shoulde geue her to another. So Iacob serue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> seuen yeeres for Rahell, &amp; they seemed vnto him but a few dayes, because he loued her. Howbeit, when the time came that she should haue beene geuen vnto Iacob, beholde her couetous father (who esteemed more the profite that he had of Iacobs seruice, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his promise or the course of the countrey,) at night after the feast was done, went and layde his eldest daughter Leah Rahels sister in her steede in Iacobs bed, who thereby preuented Rahel, &amp; became Iacobs first wife contrarie to his mynde. For which his dissembling when he was rebuked by Iacob, who serued for the younger and not for the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he alleaged custome for his excuse saying: It was not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the countrey to geue the yunger daughter before the elder, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou wilt serue me yet seuen yeeres more for the younger, I wil also geue her vnto thee for thy seruice. So Iacob being driuen for the great good will he bare to Rahell, to serue her couetous father seuen yeeres more for her, at the seuen yeeres end, she also was geuen vnto Iacob, with her mayd Bilha to be her seruaunt, and became his wife together with hir sister Lea. But Rahel was euer better beloued of her husband then Lea: Therefore when the Lord saw that, he made Rahell barren and her sister fruitfull. Now when Rahell saw that she bare Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob no children, she enuyed her sister Lea, and sayd vnto Iacob her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: Geue me children or els I die. Then Iacobs anger beyng with these wordes kindled against his wife Rahel, he said vnto her, Am I in Gods steed which hath withholden fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee the fruit of thy womb? as if he should say, it is God only that maketh barre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; fruitfull, &amp; therfore I am not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault. Behold my mayd Bilha then (quoth Rahel) &amp; go into her, &amp; she shal beare vpon my knees y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may haue children by her, &amp; I will receiue her children on my lapp, as though they were mine own, so Rahel gaue Iacob Bilha her mayd to wife, who conceiued &amp; bare her a sonne whose name shee called Dan, praysing God and saying:
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1693:113"/>
God hath geuen sentence on my side, and hath also hearde my voyce, and hath geuen me a sonne. Then Bilha her mayde conceiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne and bare Rahel the second sonne, whose name she called Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali, then after shee had receiued this benefite of God to haue children borne vnto her (such is the arrogancie of mans nature) Rahel began to contemne her sister Lea more then before, and saide with excellent wrestling, haue I wrestled with my sister, &amp; haue gotten the vpper ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Afterward when shee heard that Ruben her sisters sonne, had brought home Mandrakes out of the field, she could not be quiet till she had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten those Mandrakes of her sister, and therfore went vnto her and said, geue me I pray thee of thy sonnes mandrakes, and thou shalt sleepe with Iacob my husband this night. So she solde her husband for the mandrakes. And within a while after Rahel hauing bin long barren, at the last, that is in the yeere of the world 2259. God remembred her, heard her and opened her wombe, or made her fruitfull: so that she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and bare her first sonne, whose name she called Ioseph, praysing God and saying, God hath taken away my rebuke, the Lord will yet geue me another sonne. And assoone as Rahel had borne Ioseph, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob her husbande woulde no longer tarrye with her father Laban, but hauing got his wages of Gods blessing, &amp; not of Laba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s deliuering was ready to depart. And when he heard how Labans children and his wiues brethren did murmure &amp; grudge at his wages or wealth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God had blessed him in Labans seruice: He called Rahel &amp; Lea to the field vnto his flocke, &amp; there told them of their fathers discurtesy, or rather crueltie towards him, saying: wiues, I see your fathers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is not towards me as it was wount, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he enuieth me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the God whom my father worshippeth, hath blessed me. And yee know that I haue serued your father faithfully with all my might, but your father hath deceiued me, &amp; changed my wages ten times, howbeit God suffered him not to hurt me, but hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away your fathers sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or cattell, and geuen it me in recompence of my faithfull seruice done vnto him. Now therefore, forasmuch as yee know that the Lord hath appeared vnto me by his Angel in Bethel, and willed me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this countrey, and returne vnto my natiue countrey where I was borne: I thinke it necessarie and conuenient for mee to doe so, as the Lorde commaunded. Then Rahel and Lea being very well content with that Iacob saide, answeared Iacob and sayde: Let vs depart hence, for we haue no more portion and inheritaunce
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1693:113"/>
in our father Labans house. Yea, he doth rather count vs as straungers, for he hath sold vs (in that of a couetous mynd he hath geuen vs vnto thee in liew and recompence of thy seruice which is a kind of sale,) and hath eaten vp and consumed our money. Therefore all the riches whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che God hath taken from our father is ours, and our childrens. Nowe therefore, whatsoeuer God hath sayd vnto thee doe it. So Iacob with his wiues Rahel and Lea vnknown to Laban went away, and Rahel at her departing from Laba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her father, while he was gone to his sheepshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, &amp; vnknowne to her husbande, stole away her fathers Idols or Gods, not to woorship them, but to withdraw her father from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Howbeit it proued not so, for afterwardes these Idols were the cause that Rahel and some of Iacobs family worshipped strange Gods, as appeareth <hi>Gen. 35.</hi> where Iacob was commaunded by GOD to clense his houshold, and to cause them to put away the strange Gods from among them, and to worship God aright in Bethel. So when Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob &amp; Rahel were gone, Laba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hasted after as fast as he could, &amp; ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Iacob &amp; Rahel at Mount Gilead, there he chid Iacob for stealing away his heart, &amp; carrying away his daughters without leaue taking of him, &amp; made no litle ado with Iacob for his Gods, saying: Wherfore hast thou yet stollen away my Gods, for he wist not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Rahel his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had stollen them, and therefore hee layde them to Iacobs charge. But Iacob altogether ignoraunt of such matter &amp; guiltles, bad Laban make search for his Gods saying, search thou all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue, &amp; with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou findest thy Gods, let him not liue. Wherevppon Laba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began and searched Iacobs tent, Leas tent, &amp; the two maydens tentes, but found not his Gods: and when he came to search Rahel his daughters tent, she hauing hid his Idols in the Cammels lytter, sate downe vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; as her father was ruffling about the place where she sate, she said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: O my Lord, be not angrie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not rise vp before thee, for the custome of women is vpon me, &amp; so the thing for all his searching was not known.

And when she was going vp with her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to Bethel to dwel, she put away the strange Gods that she had stollen from Laban her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and earinges that houng in her eares, and gaue them to Iacob when he reformed his housholde, who tooke her Idols, and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous trashe, and hidde them vnder an Oke by Sichem. And when she departed from Bethel and came within halfe a dayes iourney to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrath, Rahel there by the way trauelled with her second child, and in traueling, beeing in greate paynes and sore labour, the mydwife to comfort her, sayde vnto her, feare not Rahel, for thou shalt haue this sonne also: but she through sore and perillous labour, being about to yeelde vp the ghost euen in the byrth, called her childes name Benony, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, the sonne of my sorrow, but his father Iacob called his name Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamin, and so she died in childbed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeere of the world 2275. after that she had bin married 23. yeeres to Iacob, &amp; shortly after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of her nurse Rebecca, &amp; was buried in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way to Ephrata, which is Bethlehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> border of Be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iamin: where Iacob caused a piller of stone to bee set vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her graue, as a ceremony, to testifie the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come, not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reueyled: which piller was euer after called Rahels piller or graue, or sepulchre stone. <hi>Gen. 29.30.31.33.35.48.7. 1.Sam. 10.2.</hi> After whose death y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet Ieremy lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g after did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> destruction &amp; captiuity of the Iewes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Beniamites or Israelits saying: This saith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, a voyce was heard on hye, mourning &amp; bitter weeping: Rahel weeping for her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> refused to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted, because they were not aliue but dead, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the Beniamites &amp; Israelites were so destroyed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if Rahel the mother of Beniamin coulde haue risen againe to seeke for her children, she should haue found none remayning. <hi>Ier. 31 15.</hi> Which prophecie of Rahel &amp; her children, was afterward fulfilled at the byrth of our sauiour Christ Iesus, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruel &amp; blooddy tyrant king Herod renewed the sores of the Beniamites suffered long before, by causing all the young children vnder 2. yeeres old y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem to be slaine, of purpose to kil Christ among them, but al in vain, for mauger his head Christ did &amp; doeth raygne a king blessed foreuer. <hi>Math. 2.18.</hi>

Then Rebecca (hearing him speake of her fathers Brother) ranne home and told al things what the man had sayd, in the presence and hearing of Laban her brother: who beholding the earinges and bracelettes vppon his sisters handes, and marking what shee said, ranne presentlye forth to meete the manne, and with gentle entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought him home into the house, and sawe his Camelles drest, and prouided for of prouender: and when he had so done, hee set meate also before the man to eate: but the man would not eate before he had done his maisters message, and declared the cause wherefore his master had sent him, together with the manner of his meeting with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca their Daughter at the well, whom he disired them to giue to his maysters Sonne to wife.

It is Isaak my maisters sonne (quoth the seruant) who walketh yonder, praying in the fieldes, as his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is: so when shee came neere him, shee alighted, and in token of shamefastnesse and chastitie, (as the custome of euery spouse firste brought vnto her husband was,) she tooke a vaile, &amp; couered her head &amp; face, and was deliuered vnto Isaak, being 40. yeares old: who brought her vnto his late mothers Saraes tent, &amp; so she became his wife, and this was in the yeare of the world 2148. &amp; was deerely beloued of him. Wherby he hauing newly left mourning for his mother Sara, that was lately departed this lyfe, was now by Rebecca his wife greatlye comforted and cheered againe, to his great comfort. And this mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was made in the yeare of the worldes creation 2148.</p>

childe, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last, at the earnest petition &amp; prayers of her vertuous husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, (whom God heard) conceiued with 2. children at once, &amp; when she felt them striue together within her wombe, she made her mone to God, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Seeing it is so, that one shal destroy an other, why am I thus with childe? but God made her answere, saying: There are two manner of people in thy wombe, &amp; two nations shal be deuided out of thy bowels, and the one nation shal be mightier then the other, and the elder shalbe seruant to the younger. And so, when her time was come to bee deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, she brought forth two twinnes, the one red &amp; rough, that came out first, whose name was called Esaw: the other white and smoothe, that came out last, &amp; held his brother by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heele, whose name they called Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob: which two afterward became mighty men in the world. But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca loued Iacob her youngest sonne better then Esaw her eldest: for Esaw had married in processe of time two wiues at once, of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Hittites, one called Iudith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Beshemath, who were a continual griefe of minde vnto her for their disobedience &amp; rebellion. And to preferre Iacob before Esaw, she sayd vnto Iacob: Heare mee my sonne: Behold thy father is blinde, as thou knowest, &amp; I haue heard thy father say to thy brother, goe and kill some venison, and make mee meat therof, such as I loue, that I may eate, &amp; blesse thee before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, afore I die. Now therfore my sonne heare my voyce, in that which I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund thee: Get thee now to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flock, &amp; bring me thence 2. good kids, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may make pleasant meate of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for thy father, such as he loueth, &amp; thou shalt bring it him to eate, that he may blesse thee before his death. Which subtill dealing of Rebecca with her husband is blame worthy: because she should haue taryed til God had performed his promise made towardes Iacob the younger, and not to haue sought by this sinister meanes to preuent Esaw. Then sayd Iacob vnto her: Mother, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Esaw is a rough man, &amp; I am smooth: and if my father shal happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to feele me, I shal seeme vnto him, as I went about to deceiue him, &amp; so shal I bring a curse vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, &amp; not a blessing. Wel (quoth Rebecca) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me be thy curse my sonne, only heare my voice, &amp; go fetch me y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kids: so he went &amp; fet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto her, &amp; she made pleasant meat therof, such as his father her husband loued. And when she had done: shee fet out certeine fayre cloathes of Esawes, &amp; put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon Iacob, and couered his hands and the smooth of his necke with Goates skinnes, and put the meat in Iacobs handes, to cary to his father. By which pollicie of Rebecca, Iacob gat firste his Fathers blessing, to fulfill the word of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, who
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1693:116"/>
before had sayde to Rebecca, that the elder shoulde serue the younger. But when shee heard how Esaw her sonne threatned to kill her sonne Iacob his brother, for stealing awaye thus by subtyltie his blessing, she tolde it Iacob, saying: Thy brother Esaw threatneth to sleye thee: therefore my sonne, heare my voyce, make thee ready, and get thee to Laban my brother at Haran, and there tarye with him a while, vntyll thy brothers furye and fiercenesse be asswaged, and that his wrath bee turned awaye from thee, and hee forget the thinges which thou haste done vnto him, and then will I send and fetch thee away from thence: for why should I bee depriued of you both (by murder) in one daye? And when shee had giuen her sonne Iacob this counsaile to flye away, she wente to Isaak her husbande, to perswade him to anger for Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs departure, and sayde: I am weary of my life, for this Iudith and Bathshemath the daughters of Heath, my sonne Esaws wiues, for they continually vexe my heart with their disobedience, and therfore if my sonne Iacob should take a wife also of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daughters of Heath, such a one as these are, of the daughters of that lande: what good should my life doe mee? Whereupon Isaak called Iacob, and blessed him, and sente him awaye with a great charge to take a wife of the Daughters of Laban Rebeccas brother. And thus by the counsaile and perswasion of Rebecca, Iacob escaped the daunger of Esaw, and was sent to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban his mothers brother, where in processe hee gat him a wife, and purchased the loue of Esaw againe. Afterward Rebeccaes nurse called Debora died, and was buryed in Bethel vnder an Oke. <hi>Gen. 22.23. 24.5.25.26.34.27.35.8.</hi>

And when her husbande was dead, and her sister in lawes also, shee and her sister went to bring her olde mother Naomy then a widdowe also, on her waye, trauailing home to her owne countrey of Iuda. And when she
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:1693:117"/>
had gone a good way with her mother, and her sister Orpha, with much intreatie of her mother in lawe, was returned backe to her house in Moab. Ruth for no intreatie nor perswasion that her mother in law coulde vse vnto her, woulde in anye wise forsake her or departe from her: for when her mother Naomy sayde vnto her: Oh see my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thy sister in lawe Orpha is gone home againe to her people, and to her godes, return thou also &amp; go after her, she being by Gods wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouidence appoynted to be one of his housholde, coulde by no perswasion bee turned backe from God, that had chosen her to bee his: but answered Naomy her mother in law thus, Intreate mee not to leaue thee, nor to departe from thee: for whether thou goest, I will goe: and where thou dwellest, I will dwell: thy people shall bee my people: and thy God my God: Looke where thou diest, there will I dye also, and there will I bee buryed. The Lorde doe so, and so vnto me, if ought but death onelye departe thee and me asunder: so forsaking father and mother, and her owne countrey where shee was borne, shee went forwarde with her mother in lawe, till she came to Bethlem Iuda, which was in the moneth Aprill, or in the beginning of barley haruest. Whither when she came, to declare her great affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that shee bare towardes her mother in lawe, shee was verye dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and willing to spare no paynefull diligence, to gette both her owne and her poore mother in lawes lyuing, and humbly sayde vnto Naomy: I praye thee let mee goe to the fielde and gleane eares of corne together after him, in whose sight God shall make mee finde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. And so as Ruth went out one day a leasing among the harueste folke, shee happened by the prouidence of God, vppon the fieldes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining to Boaz, who shewed her such kindnesse, that shee neyther lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked meate nor drinke, neyther yet corne so long as haruest lasted, which she caryed home stil to her mother in lawe, to relieue her. And when al haruest was done: her mother in law Naomy gaue her this counsaile, saying: This man Booz, in whose fielde thou hast leased all this while, is our neere kinsman: therefore do now by my counsaile. This night he wynnoweth barley in the barne, wash thy selfe therefore, and annoyt thee, and put thy rayment vpon thee, and get thee to the barne, and keepe thy selfe close vntill he haue left eating and drinking, and when hee goeth to sleepe, marke the place where he layeth him downe: And when he is a sleepe, goe and lyft vp the cloathes softly at his feete, and lay thee downe, and he shall tell thee what thou shalt doe. So when

Ruth had done all thinges according to her mother in lawes teaching, Boaz about midnight awaked out of his sleepe, and feeling one lye at his feete, was afrayde, and groping with his hande, hee asked who it was: I am Ruth (quoth shee) thine handmaide: spreade therefore the wing of thy garment ouer thine handmaiden, for thou art next of my kinne.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1693:119"/>
declare what they gaine that attempt any thing against the worde of God: Then she made her complaint vnto Abraham, &amp; said: Thou doest me wrong, I haue giuen my maid into thy bozome, and she seeth that she hath conceiued, and I am despised in her eyes, the Lorde iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and me. Behold (quoth Abraham) thy maid is in thy hande and power, doe with her as it pleaseth thee. Then Sara dealt roughly with Hagar her maid, &amp; was so quick &amp; sharpe with her, that she made her run away. Neuerthelesse at the humble submission of Hagar, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra receiued her againe.</p>
                     <p>After this it pleased God to renewe his promise and couenant made with Abraham her husband, concerning the issue that he should haue of the body of Sarai his wife, whose name God then changed with her husbands, and called Sarah, that before was Sarai. And to that ende when God sent his three Angels to renew the same promise to Sarah herselfe in the plaine of Mamre, shee courteously entertained those three Angels, and made them a feast in her tent: and as she stood behind the tent dore, and heard the Angels say vnto her husband Abraham, Lo, Sarah thy wife shall haue a soone. Shee rather hauing respect to the order of nature (because she being well stricken in age, and very olde, euen fourescore and tenne yeere olde, insomuch that it ceased to be with her after the maner of women, that is past childe bearing:) Then belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the promise of God, so often made and repeated, and thinking it impossible for her to haue a childe: she, I say, then laughed within her selfe, &amp; said: Is it of a suretie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I shall haue a sonne? Shal I now giue my selfe to lust being old, &amp; my Lord is old also? <hi>1. Pet. 3.6.</hi> And when she had talked thus with her selfe, the Angel of the Lord seeing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust of Sara, at the first saide vnto her husband Abraham: wherefore did Sarah thus laugh, as though (quoth he) it were a hard thing for the Lord to performe his promise. Then she being asked the question, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued for her incredulitie of the Angell, denied it, saying: I laughed not (for shee was afraide) but the Angell said, it is not so, for thou laughedst.</p>
                     <p>Afterward Sara going fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mamre, &amp; soiourning in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rar among the Philistines: It chanced y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Abimelech y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of Gerar, hearing of her wonderful beautie, sent &amp; tooke Sara away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>husband of purpose to haue lyen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her. But God whoeuer most great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detesteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breach of marriage, by dreame or vision in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same night be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer he had come neere her or touched her, reuealed vnto Abime.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1693:120"/>
Behold thou art but dead, because of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which thou hast taken, for shee is a mans wife: whereunto Abimelech, as one failing by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and not doing euill of purpose, nor thinking to doe any man harme, made his excuse to God againe, and said for himselfe thus, Lord wilt thou slay euen the righteous nation? saide not hee (that is Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) vnto me: Shee is my sister? yea, and shee herselfe saide, hee is my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: (which fault she had now twise fallen into, such is mans frailtie) with an vpright minde, and innocent handes haue I done this. I knowe it saide God, that thou didst so: but yet I kept thee also that thou shouldest not sinne against mee, therefore suffered I not thee to touch her, now therefore deliuer the man his wife againe. For he (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Abraham her husband) is a Prophet, and he shal pray for thee that thou maiest liue: but if thou deliuer her not againe, be sure that thou shalt die the death, and all that thou hast. Then Abimelech in all hast very early in the morning called for Abraham, and said vnto him, what hast thou done vnto vs, and wherein haue I haue offended thee, that thou hast brought on me &amp; my kingdom this great sin? Thou hast done this vnto mee by calling thy wife sister, that ought not to bee done. Because (quoth Abraham) I thought this with my selfe, surely the feare of God is not in this place, and they will slay mee for my wiues sake, therefore did I call her sister, yet in very deede shee is my sister (that is my cosin germane) for shee is the daughter of my father (that is of my fathers brother): But not the daughter of my mother, and she is my wife. And that shee calleth mee brother, is but of a couenant of kindnesse that was priuily made long agoe betwixt her and mee in all places where we became. Then Abimelech the king gaue Abraham beeues, sheepe, men seruants, and maide seruants, and greatly inriched him: &amp; also restored vnto him Sarah his wife, giuing him leaue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and dwell where hee woulde in his Dominion: but before Sara departed, as God had suffered this Heathen king to doe vnto her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande: so nowe hee reproued Sarah his wife also for her dissembling &amp; lying: Behold, I haue giuen thy brother a thousand peeces of siluer, beholde he is in the vaile of thine enemies to all that are with thee, and to all others: as if he had said: Sara, seeing God hath giuen thee an husbande, as a vaile or defence, yea, such a head, as with whom thou maiest bee preserued from all dangers, thou hast done euill to vse this dissimulation with mee, in calling him thy brother, that is indeede thine husbande. Then Abraham prayed vnto God for Abimelech, &amp; God
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1693:120"/>
heard his yrayer, and healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: so that they conceaued afterwarde and bare children, for before the Lorde had taken away from them the gift of conceauing, and shut vp euery wombe in the house of Abimelech, because of Sara Abrahams wife.</p>
                     <p>Now the Lord visited Sara while shee was in the land of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines at Gerar: so that shee through faith receiued strength to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue seede, and brought foorth a sonne in her olde age, at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, according as he had promised by the Angel, because she iudged him faithfull that had promised: So that of one woman, euen of her y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was as one dead &amp; past age, there sprang so many, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> starres of the skie in multitude, &amp; as the sand in the Sea shore, which is innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable. <hi>Heb. 11.11. 12.</hi> And Abraham called his sonnes name Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, and when the childe was borne, shee accused her self of ingratitude in that shee did not beleeue the Almightie, and said: God hath made me to reioyce: all that heare will reioyce with mee, who woulde haue said to Abraham, that Sara should haue giuen children sucke? for I haue borne him a sonne in his olde age.</p>
                     <p>After this, when Sara saw and perceiued Ismael the sonne of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar her maide, as he plaied with Isaak, mocking and deriding Gods promises made to Isaak, which the Apostle to the Galathians, 4.29. calleth persecution, she complained thereof vnto Abraham, and saide: Put away, or cast out this bond maid and her sonne: for the sonne of this bond woman shall not bee heire with my sonne Isaak. Which thing was very greeuous in Abrahams sight, because hee loued Ismael. But God saide vnto Abraham, Let it not greeue thee for the childes sake, or his mother: but in all that Sara shall say vnto thee, heare her voyce, for in Isaak shall thy seede bee blessed: that is, the promised seed shalbe counted from thy sonne Isaak borne of Sarah, and not from Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael. <hi>Rom. 9.9.</hi> Then Abraham followed his wife Saraes counsaile, and put away Hagar, and her sonne foorth of his house, who after liued in the wildernesse of Paran, and troubled Sara no more.</p>
                     <p>Finally, when Sara was an hundred and seuen and twentie yeeres olde, in the yeere of the worlde, 2145. she died in Kyriath-arba, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called Hebron, in the land of Canaan, and was buried in the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble caue of the field Machpelah, ouer against Mamre, which is Hebron, which Abraham her husband bought of the sonnes Heath, called the Hittites, of purpose to bury Sara: for whose death he greatly lamented
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1693:121"/>
and mourned, &amp; after her to be a place of common buriall, for all his &amp; her posteritie for euer. And after the death of Sarai, Abraham tooke him another wife called Keturah, by whom he had diuers sonnes. <hi>Gen. 11.29. 12.5.13. &amp;c, 13.1.16.17.15.21. 18.6,9.11.12. &amp;c. 20. 21. 1.2. &amp;c.</hi> till verse 15. 23.1. reade <hi>Iosephus</hi> fol. 180.181.</p>

                     <p>She was the only daughter of one Raguel, and Anna or Edna that dwelt in Rages, otherwise called Ecbatane, a Citie of the Medes, where Sarra hauing had seuen husbandes, one after another in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, the men before they had lien with her, were all one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother (by Gods prouidence and permission, who had reserued Sara to be wife for young Tobie, as afterwarde shall appeare) slaine by the euill spirite, or Diuell called Asmodius, to the great discomfort and heauinesse of the young woman and her friendes. And yet to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate her sorrowe and griefe the more, Beholde, her fathers maides when shee did correct them for their faultes, woulde slaunder her, cheek and reproue her, on this wise, saying: Doest thou not know that thou hast strangled thine husbandes? Thou hast had nowe seuen husbands, neither wast thou named after any of them. Wherefore doest thou beate vs for them, if they bee dead, goe thy way hence to them, and God let vs neuer see sonne nor daughter of thee more vppon earth, thou killer of thine husbandes, wilte thou slay vs also, as thou hast slaine seuen men? When Sara hearde these wordes, shee was very sorowfull: so that shee thought to haue strangled her selfe: But beeing better aduised, shee saide with her selfe: I am the onely daughter of my father, and if I doe this, I shall slaunder him, and shall bring his age to the graue with sorrow. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shee cast aside all suche wicked and vngodly thoughtes, as at the first oppressed her, and in great pacience, betooke her selfe to fasting and prayer, with all deuotion and godlinesse, in so muche as in the midst of her griefe and affliction, shee got her vp to an high cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her house, where shee continued three dayes, and three nights without meate and drinke, in heartie prayer, towarde the windowe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching God with teares, that hee would vouchsafe to loose and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer her from this rebuke, or els to take her out of the earth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as before in the first Lampe of Uirginitie, Page 39. After prayer, shee came downe from her chamber and praysed the Lorde.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1693:121"/>
And note that at the very same instant that shee made her prayers, old Tobie also made his prayers to God, beeing rebuked of his wife An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and both their prayers came together, and were heard, &amp; receiued also at one time before God, who thereupon to both their comfortes, sent his good Angel Raphael to heale them both: that is, to take away the blindnesse of Tobie: and to giue Sarra for a wife to Tobias, the sonne of Tobit, and to binde Asmodius the euill spirite, because shee belonged to young Tobie by right. For young Tobie being sent by his father to Rages, where Sara dwelt, &amp; conducted all the way by the Angell Raphael, when they were come neere to Rages, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell saide to the young man: Brother, to day wee shall lodge with Raguel, who is thy cosin, hee also hath one only daught<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then answered the young man Tobias, and saide: I vnderstand, and haue heard (bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Azariah) that this maide hath beene giuen to seuen men, who died in the marriage chamber, and were slaine of the Diuell. I am afraide therefore, least such thinges shoulde happen vnto mee: for if I, as thou knowest, the only begotten sonne of my father, should go into her, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I feare the wicked spirits do loue, because they hurt no bodie but those which come into her, &amp; it should come to passe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I also should die as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other vii.

                     <p>Then said the Angel againe vnto him: doest thou not remembtr the precepts that thy father gaue thee, when he charged thee of his blessing that thou shouldest marry a wife of thine owne kinred: wherfore heare me, O my brother, for shee shalbe thy wife, neither bee thou carefull or fearefull of the euill spirite. For I will tell thee what they be of whom the Diuell hath power: namely, they that receiue mariage after suche a fashion, that they shut God out of them, and from their heartes, and giue themselues to their owne lustes, euen as it were an Horse and Mule, whiche haue no vnderstanding: vppon suche hath the

the same Diuell Asmodeus power: But this same night shall Sarah bee giuen thee in marriage. And when thou takest her, and art come into the bed chamber, withold thy selfe from her three dayes, and giue thy diligence to nothing, but vnto prayer together with her. And in the first night, take the heart and liuer of the fishe, and lay it vpon hot coles, and make a perfume thereof, to perfume the chamber, and when the Diuell doth smell the same, hee shall flee away, and neuer come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine any more. The seconde night also, when thou shalt come to her, and goe into thy bed, ryse vp both of you, and pray to God, which is mercifull, who will haue pitie on you, and saue you: and so shall you bee receiued into the companie of the holy Patriarches. The third night, arise, and pray likewise both together, that yee may obtaine the blessing of God, and haue whole and sounde children begotten and borne of your bodies. And after the thirde night feare not, but take the maiden in the feare of God, for shee is appointed vnto thee from the beginning, and abuse her not, but vse her body modestly, more for the desire of children, then for any fleshly lust, that in the feede of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou maiest obtaine the blessing in children: And thou shalt keepe her, and shee shall goe with thee. Moreouer, I suppose that shee shall beare thee children. Now when young Toby heard these thinges, hee loued Sara before that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And when they were come to Raguels house in Ragis, it was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raes chaunce to meet them first, who after gentle salutations vsed ech to other, brought them into her fathers house, where after further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance taken, when shee heard that olde Toby was blinde, she with her father and mother wept, and were very sorowfull for that his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And after much good cheere, and courteous entertainemente, made by her father and mother, and her selfe vnto them: the Angell brake the matter and cause of their comming, first to Raguel, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with him, about the giuing of his daughter to young Toby his cosin. And Raguel Saraes father being very willing so to doe, tolde him all the doubt, and thinges that hee feared woulde discourage the young man, saying: It is meete that thou shouldest marry my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Neuertheles, I will declare vnto thee al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, I haue giuen my daughter alredy in mariage to seuen men, who dyed that same night y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they came into her. Therefore, I feare least it should chance vnto thee in like maner: No, (quoth the Angel) feare not to giue him thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1693:122"/>
in mariage, for vnto this man Tobie which feareth God, doth thy daughter Sara belong to wife, therefore might many marry her, but none other haue or inioy her, as appeareth by thy saying, in that the seuen men are all dead, before they euer lay with her. Yea, (quoth yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Toby) who for all this was couragious, &amp; mery, &amp; constantly set in the loue of Sara, I will neither eate nor drinke here this day, except thou first graunt me my petition: that is, doe not only promise mee, to giue me thy daughter Sara, but also bring her foorth hither, and presentlie betroth her to me to be my wife. Then Raguel perceiuing this to bee the worke of God, who had sent them for the same intent, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might bee maried in her owne kinred, according to the law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, doubted not to giue her vnto young Tobie, but said vnto him: take her then, &amp; marry her according to the custome: for thou art her cosin, &amp; she is thine, and God which is mercifull, make this prosperous to you both in al good things. So he called his daughter Sara, who came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, &amp; he tooke her by the right hand, &amp; gaue her into the right hand of Tobie for a wife vnto him, &amp; blessed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saying: Behold, take her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the law of Moses, &amp; lead her away to thy father: And the God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, the God of Isaak, &amp; the God of Iacob, be with you, ioyne you together, &amp; fulfill his blessing in you. And then, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, in the yeere of the world, 3414. Raguel with his wife Edna made a contract of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, &amp; sealed it, to approue both their consents to the marriage of their daughter: &amp; so after the feast praised God. And when night came, her mother Edna, at her husbands commandement, prepared another cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for Sara to lie in, who so soone as she was brought thither, fel a we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. But her mother wyped away her daughters tears, &amp; comforted her with sweete wordes, saying: Be of good cheere my daughter, the Lord of heauen &amp; earth giue thee ioy for this thy sorrow &amp; heauinesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast suffered, be of good comfort my daughter. So when she was in the chamber a bed, they brought in Tobie her husband also into her, who remembring the Angels wordes, perfumed the chamber with the liuer of the fish, which perfume, when the euill spirite had smelled, hee fled straight way into the vttermost parts of Egypt, for the Angel Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael had taken hold of the Diuel Asmodeus, &amp; bound him, &amp; sent him into the wildernes of the higher Egypt. And after that they were both shut in, Tobias rose out of the bed, &amp; said vnto the virgin, vp sister Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, arise, &amp; let vs make our prayer vnto God, that hee would haue pitie on vs, to day, to morrowe, and the thirde day: for these three nightes
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1693:123"/>
will wee ioyne or reconcile our selues to God, and when the thirde holy night is past, wee shall ioyne together in the duetie of marriage. For wee are the children of holy men, and wee may not come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Heathen that knowe not God. Then shee arose, and they stood vp both together, and besought God earnestly, that he would preserue them, praying and saying, as in the first Lampe of Uirgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And after their prayer ended, they went to bed and slept both together that night: But Raguel Saraes father, thinking Tobias was dead as the other seuen, made a graue for him, and purposing to haue buryed him secretly the same night, that none shoulde haue kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen of it, Hee sent his maide into the chamber to see whether hee were dead or aliue: who comming into the chamber, and finding them both safe and sounde, fast a sleepe together, brought good tidings again to Raguel, and tolde him, that Tobias was aliue: which caused Ragu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell not a little to reioyce, and prayse the Lorde, because hee had mercye on them two, which were the only begotten children of their fathers. And after commaunding the graue to bee filled vp, he made a greate wedding feast, which hee kept for ioy 14. dayes, and gaue halfe of his goods to Tobie towardes the marriage of his daughter Sarra, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the rest vnto him &amp; her by writing after his and his wiues death. So after the fourteene dayes expired, in the which space Tobias begate his wife with childe, When Raguel by no intreatie coulde persuade Tobie to carry any longer from his sorrowfull father &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that long expected his returne: He deliuered his daughter Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra vnto him, together with her portion, and so sent her away from him with health and ioy, and with his blessing, saying: The God of heauen make you my children to prosper before I die. And with this exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on giuen to Sarra his daughter, saying: Honor thy father and mother in lawe, which are now thy parents, that I may heare good report of thee. Also, see thou loue thine husband, and rule well thine houshold, keeping them in good order, that thou mayest shewe thy selfe faultlesse, and so kissed them, and tooke his leaue of them. And to Tobias, her mother Edna gaue this charge concerning Sarra, saying: The Lorde of heauen restore thee my deare brother, and graunt that I may see thy children of my daughter Sarra, that I may reioyce before the Lorde: Beholde, now I commit to thee my daughter as a pledge, doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate her euill.

But the Midwiues made their excuse, and answered the king, saying: Because O king (quoth they) the Hebrue women are not like the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Egypt, for they are more strong, and sturdie women, and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and quicklie deliuered yer the Midwiues come at them.

                     <p>Shee was the daughter of Helchias of the tribe of Iuda, and wife of Ioachim a very great riche man, and of high reputation and honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes in Babylon where hee dwelt. Nowe shee beeing a very fayre woman, well brought vp, and instructed by her parentes in the law of Moses, &amp; one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> feared God. In the same first yere that she was married, there were two Iudges made of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ancients of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which resorted muche to her husbande Ioachims house, because hee was the most honorable of all others, and all they of the Iewes which had any thing to doe in the lawe, came thither also vnto them to haue their matters hearde and decided. These two Iudges (beeing wicked men) were so wounded with the loue of Susanna, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so in lust towards her both at one time vnwitting one to the other, that they wist not what to doe: but neither durst tel the other his grief, nor yet for shame vtter their inordinate dotage and lust vnto her. And so on a day when they had sate long in Ioachims house about matters of the lawe, and waited for to haue their purpose on Susanna, and coulde not, they brake vp and went home to dinner. And at their returne againe togethers, the one brake to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other their whole minds, &amp; appointed a time when they mighte take her alone. And when they had espied out a conuenient time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Susanna went into a faire garden that shee had adioyning vnto her house (as her manner was there to walke euer about noone, when her husbandes Clients were all gone home to dinner:) with two of her maidens onelie accompanying her there, to walke &amp; wash herselfe in the heate of the day: Behold these two olde lechers hid them selues in the garden against her comming. And assoone as her maidens had shut the garden or orcharde dore, and were gone for oyle and sope for their mistres, as shee had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them: These two wicked Elders or lecherous Iudges, who had lyen there priuilie hid vnknowen to Susanna and her maidens, like two neighing horsses came vpon her now beeing all alone, and saide: Beholde, the garden dores are nowe shut that no man can see vs, and wee burne in loue with thee: therefore consent vnto vs and lye with vs, if thou willt not, wee will beare wtinesse against thee, that a young man was in the Orchard with thee, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou sentest away thy maydens from thee, because thou wouldest
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1693:125"/>
commit adultery with him. And then Susanna sighed, and saide, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, I am in trouble on euery side, for if I followe your mindes, and doe the thing, it will bee my death: And if on the other side I consent not vnto you, nor doe it not, yet can I not escape your handes, Well, it is better for mee to fall into your handes without the deede doing, then to sinne in the sight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord by doing it. And with that shee cryed out vpon them with a loude voice. And the olde lechers cryed out as fast against her, which clamour on both parties was so great, that it was hard among her seruants without, which ranne to the garden dore, and burst it open for hast, to see what the matter was. And when the seruants had heard the elders false report of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna: they beeing a little too hastie in beleeuyng so false a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte of their mistres, were greatly ashamed of her: for there was neuer suche a report made of Susanna before.</p>
                     <p>So on the morrowe after these two wicked Iudges full of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheuous imaginations againste Susanna, came to Ioachim her husbandes house, as the manner was, and there declared the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (but most falsly) against her to her husbande, and all by wrongfull accusation to bring her to death, for spight that shee would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to their diuelishe desires. And when shee was sent for to her fathers house, where she then laye, and came accompanied with her father and mother, her children, and all her kin, to bee iudged and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raygned before them for a breaker of wedlock, and an adultresse accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the lawe of God: shee beeing a very tender person, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous fayre of face, stoode before the two wicked Iudges with her face couered: But these lecherous dottards, to the end they might at the least bee satisfied with her beautie, commanded to take the vaile or cloth from her face, that they might fully behold her, &amp; haue a full sight of her beautie, which thing being done, to the griefe of her friends, and many that stoode about her: These two wicked Iudges stood vp them selues both to be her accusers and iudges, and laying their handes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of Susanna (who wept and looked vp to heauen, for her heart trusted in the Lorde:) They said, as we were walking alone in the garden, this woman came in with her two maides, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shee sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, making fast the orchard dores after them, with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a young felow which there lay hid in the garden, start vp &amp; went vnto her, &amp; lay with her: then wee which stood in a corner of the garden, seeing this wickednesse, ranne vnto them and sawe them as they were together,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1693:126"/>
but wee coulde not holde the fellowe, for hee was stronger then wee, and got open the dore and leaped out. And when wee had taken this woman, wee demaunded of her, what fellowe it was, but shee woulde not tell vs. This is the matter that wee lay vnto her charge, and wee be witnesses of the same: Then the common sort beleeued them, as those that were the Elders and chiefe Iudges of the people: and so they condemned Susanna to death: whereuppon her friends, yea, and all they that knewe her, for sorrowe beganne to weepe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment heartilie for her. Yea, and Susanna her selfe then cryed out with a loude voice, and made her feruent prayer vnto God, saying as before in the first Lampe, Pag. 48. O euerlasting God, thou searcher of heartes, thou that knowest all thinges before they come to passe, thou wotest that they haue borne false witnesse against mee, and behold I must die, whereas (thou Lorde knowest) I neuer intended, or once so much as thought, much lesse did any such thing, as these men haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously imagined or inuented against mee. And the Lorde heard her prayer: Therefore when shee was ledde to bee put to death according to her iudgement, and as shee was going to the place of execution, the Lorde of heauen which had commpassion of this innocent woman, &amp; neuer forsaketh &amp; leaueth his, but helpeth them euen then when all thinges seeme past hope of mercy, to the great comfort of all oppressed Christians, raised vp the spirite of a little young childe called Daniel, who cryed with a loude voyce to the great admiration no doubt of all that heard him, saying: I am cleane from the blood of this woman. And when the people heard that, they stayed and turned them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the childe, and demaunded of him what hee meant by his wordes: O yee children of Israel (saide hee) are yee such fooles that without examination and knowledge of the trueth, yee haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned a daughter of Israel? Returne againe to iudgement, for they haue borne false witnesse against her. Then the people went backe againe in all hast. And the Elders tooke Daniell, and set him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in iudgement, who when he had commanded the two olde lecherous Iudges that were the false witnesses, to be seuered one from another, that hee might examine them seuerally a parte, hee called the one of them &amp; said vnto him: O thou old cankered carle, that art old in a wicked life, and hast vsed thy vncleannesse so long. Now thy sinnes and vngracious deedes which thou hast committed afore time, are come to light, for thou hast born false witnes, &amp; hast pronounced false erronious
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1693:126"/>
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Thou hast condemned the innocent, &amp; hast let the guiltie go free: Albeit, the Lord sayd: the innocent and righteous shalt thou not slaye. Now then, if thou hast seene her commit this villanie, tell mee vnder what tree of the orchard or garden thou sawest this woman and the young fellow company together? He answered: vnder a Mulbery or Lentiske tree. Now verily (quoth Daniell) thou hast lyed against thine owne head. For loe, the Angell of God hath receiued the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God to cut thee in two. For thou art worthy of death, in that thou hast oppressed the innocent woman, contrary to the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, who sayd: The innocent and righteous, see thou slaye not: neyther shalt thou beare false witnesse against thy neighbour, and so he put him aside.</p>
                     <p>Then the childe called the other old dotard, &amp; sayd likewise vnto him: O thou seede of Canaan, &amp; not of Iuda, bewtie hath deceiued thee, and lust hath subuerted thine heart. Thus haue ye long dealt with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Israell, &amp; they for feare conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto you, and companyed with you: but this woman being a daughter of Iuda, would not abide your wickednesse. Now tell me vnder what tree didst thou take them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying together? He answered: vnder a Pyne prune, or Mirtle tree. Uery well, sayde Danyell. Nowe verilye thou hast lyed also against thine owne lyfe or head: therefore the Messenger or Angel of the Lord standeth waiting with the sworde, to cut thee also in two, and so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye you both. And with that all the whole assemblye cryed with a loude voice, and praysed God, which so miraculouslye had preserued Susanna that daye, and saued her that trusted in him. And so fell vpon the two wicked Iudges, who were conuict by their owne mouthes of falshoode, and according to the law of Moses <hi>Deuter. 19.19.</hi> put them both to death for bearing false witnesse against their neighbour.

And when it was told Thamar, that Iudah her father in law was a widdower, and that he had left mourning, and was gone to a place called Timnah with his friend Hyra, to see his sheepeshearers: she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that Selah was not giuen to her in marryage, caste off her widdowes garments from her, and couered her with a vayle, and wrapped her selfe, and so went disguised like a common harlot, and satte downe in an open place, by the hye way side going to Thimnah. And as Iudah her father in law passed that way, and saw one sit muffled with her face couered, like a whore, and being wonderfully blinded by God, that he could not know her by her talke to bee his daughter in lawe, hee wente vnto her, and sayde: Come I praye thee, lette mee lye with thee. What wilte thou giue mee then
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1693:128"/>
(quoth shee) I will (quoth hee) sende thee a kidde from the flocke: Then leaue me a pledge (quoth she) till thou send it. What pledge shal I leaue thee (quoth Iuda?) thy signet (quoth she) vpon thy finger, thy cloake and thy staffe. He did so, and lay with her, and she was begotten with childe by him at the same time, which was in the yere of the world 2283. And then she arose and went and put her vayle from her, and put on her widdowes rayment againe. Afterward Iudah comming to his flocke, according to his promise, sent her a kydde by his friend Hyra: to the ende no other might know of his wickednesse, and gaue him charg to bring with him his ring, cloake and staffe, that hee had left with her in pledge. Who comming to the place, and finding not the woman there: hee asked of the men there aboute where the whore was, that sat in the hye way as they came: They made answere againe there was no whore there. Then Hyra returned to Iuda, and told him, he could not finde her. Well sayd Iuda (who feared man more then God, as it appeareth,) let her take it to her, least we be ashamed.</p>
                     <p>Now was Tamar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued with childe, and when she had gon three monethes, the thing was espyed, and one came and told Iuda, that his daughter in law Tamar had played the whore, and was with childe. Then bring her forth (quoth hee) and let her bee burnte. Whereby wee see that the lawe which was written in mans heart, taught them that whordome shoulde be punished with death: Albeit, as yet no lawe was giuen. And as shee was lead forth to the fire to be burnt to death, she sente the pledges to Iudah her father in lawe, saying: by the same man to whome these thinges doe pertaine, am I with chylde. Then Iudah knowing his pledges, that is his ring, his cloake and staffe, and hauing the horror of the sinne condemning him, sayde: she is more righteous then I: yea shee ought rather to accuse mee, then I her, for shee hath done this deede through my defaulte and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: because I gaue her not to Sela my sonne, as I promised. So was Tamar saued from death, and hee laye no more with her. And afterwarde when the tyme came, that shee shoulde bee deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, behold there were two twinnes in her wombe: And in her trauell, the one put out his hande, and the midwife tooke and bound a red thred about his hand, saying: this is come out first: but when hee plucked his hande backe agayne, loe his brother came firste out,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1693:128"/>
And the midwife sayde, how hast thou broken the breach vppon thee, or the separation betweene thee and thy brother, and his name was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Phares: that is a parting. And afterwarde came out his brother, that had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> red thread about his had, annd his name was called zarah, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is vpsproonge, or rysing, by whose monstrous byrth, the haynous sinne of incestuous adulterie in the father and mother, God would should be signified to all men. <hi>Genesis 38.</hi> all. Notwithstanding, it pleased God afterwarde, that of this Phares her sonne, Christ Iesus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour should bee borne, according to the fleshe: as from the stocke and line of Dauid, by Iuda, which shame our Sauiour Christ did take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him to set forth his great humilitie: who made himselfe of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in this worlde, but became a seruaunte for our sakes: yea a worme, and no man, the reproch of men, and contempte of the people, and at length suffered the most shameful &amp; accursed death of the crosse, to him therefore of all his creatures both in heauen and earth, be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and giuen all glory, prayse and thankes for euer and euer.

                        <hi>Thamar,</hi> or Tamar, the Daughter of King Dauid, borne vnto him in Ierusalem, about the eighte yeere of his reigne ther, and in the yeere of the worlde 3077. was so bewtifull a young woman, that Amnon her halfe brother fell greatly in loue with her: insomuch that because it was hard for him to doe any thing to her, and that he coulde not haue such accesse vnto her, as he would, by reason that she being a virgin was so straightly kept in her fathers house, as virgins were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed in those dayes: he therfore was so sore vexed, that he fell sicke for loue of her, and wist not what to doe, vntill he brake his minde vnto his friende Ionadab, who being a subtill fellowe, and vnderstanding that he languished and pyned away for loue of his sister Tamar, hee gaue Ammon his friend this counsayl, saying: lye down in thy bed, &amp; make thy selfe sicke, and when thy father shall come to see thee: say vnto him, I praye thee let my sister Tamar come and giue mee meate, and let her dresse meate in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it of her hand (where wee see y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no enterpryse so wicked, that can lacke counsayle to further it.) So Amnon redilye followed this lewde counsayle of his friende, and wente and layde him downe vpon his bed, and made himselfe very sicke: which when king Dauid his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heard, he came to visit him: vnto whome Amnon then sayd, I pray thee O king, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1693:129"/>
euen some delicate or daintie dish of meate in my sight, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue meate at her hand. Then Dauid mistrusting nothing, sent home to Thamar, and willed her to go to her brother Ammo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s house, to dresse him meat. So Thamar went and visited her brother Ammon at her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commaundement, and dressed him certeine deintie and delicate meate in his sight, and brought it him to eate: but he refused it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he like a wicked man was ashamed to doe that before men, which he was not affrayd to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit in the sight of God, he sayd: cause ye euery man to goe from me: So when euery body was gone out from him, he sayd to Thamar, now bring me thy meate into my chamber, and I will eate it at thy hande. Now when Thamar brought him his meate, and sette it before him to eate, Ammon tooke her, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to force her to lye with him, saying: come lye with mee my sister: Then shee seeing that, sayde: Naye my brother doe not force mee, for no such thing ought to bee done in Israel: commit not that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye against the lawe, which saieth: thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy sister, the daughter of thy father. <hi>Leuit. 18.9.</hi> For if thou doe, alas (quoth shee) howe shall I put awaye my shame, or whether shall I bee able to goe, to couer my reproch. As for thy selfe, thou shalt bee counted as one of the fooles, or as a lewde and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Israell. Nowe therefore I praye thee speake (rather) to the king my father: for hee will not denye mee vnto thee. Howbeit, Ammon burned so filthely in luste towardes her, that hee would not harken to her vertuous wordes and good counsayle: but being stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in wickednesse then shee, hee forced her, and violently rauished and laye with her against her will, shee being but fourteene yeares of age. And then the flame of his hotte loue was quenched, and the fyre of his malyce so kindled against her, that the hatred wherewith he nowe hated her, was greater then the loue wherewith hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loued her. And in a rage hee thrust her from him, and with currishe speeche sayde vnto her: vppe, gette thee hence out of my sight. Well (quoth Thamar) thou hast no cause thus to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neuerthelesse hee would not heare her, and there was no remedie, but out of his house shee must needes goe: &amp; therfore he called his seruaunts and commaunded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, saying: put this woman now out from mee, and locke the doore after her. So

Thamar beeing shutte out of his house, and for shame wiste not whether to goe: put ashes vppon her head, and rente her gaye garmente of diuers colours and peeces, such as the kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that were Uirgines did vse to weare, and was had in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test estimation in those dayes. And so went shee crying home to her owne brother Absoloms house: but when her father king Dauid heard all these thinges, hee was verye wroth with Ammon. And Absolon when he vnderstoode the matter and cause of her complaynte, by and by hee conceiuing sodeine vengeance in his heart against his brother Ammon, for defiling thus his sister: yet dissembling the matter a while, tyll occasion serued: in the meane while hee comforted his sis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Thamar, saying: Hath Ammon thy brother bin with thee? Now yet bee still my sister, hee is thy brother, let not these thinges greeue thine heart. So Tamar remayned desolate in her brother Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loms house: who two yeere after tooke occasion to bee reuenged on Ammon, for this villanie offred to his sister Tamar: and at a banket made of purpose, hee caused his men to kil him, as hee satte at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with the reste of his brethren.

Howbeit, beyng rescued by Moses, that sate there at the wel, as a banished man driuen out of Egypt, who rose vp and defended them, they drew water enough and watered their sheep: they returned home againe, their father there seeing them come sooner then they were woont to doe, asked of them how chaunce they had done so quickly: A man of Egypt (quoth they) deliuered vs from the hands of the Shepheards, and also drewe water ynough, and watred our sheepe. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their father to declare his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mynde, was desirous to recompence the benefite and good turne, done by Moses vnto his daughters, and saide vnto them, where is he?

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon Moses seeing the great impaciencie of his wife zippora, fearing least if she should goe on still with him, she would be a great let and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to his vocation, which was now most daungerous and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, to deliuer Gods people from the tyranny of such a mighty tyrant and oppressour, as Pharao was, therefore he sent zippora his wife with her 2. sonnes backe againe vnto her father Iethro: where she remayned til after the deliuerance of the Israelites through the redde Sea. And in the yeere of the world 2515, when she heard what God had done for her husband and for his people, she with her two sonnes and her father came vnto her husband Moses into the wildernes by the mount of God called Horeb, where the Israelites camped, and euer after she remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Moses her husband.

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:1693:138"/>
A misterie, great Babilon, the mother of whoredomes and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth. And I saw this woman dronken with the blood of Saintes, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Iesus. And I heard this strumpet glorifie her selfe, and boast gloriously of her pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, saying in her heart: I sitte and lyue in pleasure being a queene, and am no widdow, and shall see no mourning: Yea, I saw the kings of the earth commit fornication with this whore, and the inhabitantes of the earth drinke, til they were dronken with the wine of her forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the marchantes of the earth traffike with her, and buye her ware, to make them selues rich thereby of the aboundaunce of her pleasures, euen her ware of gold and siluer, precious stones &amp; pearles of fine linnen, purple, silke, scarlette, and all manner of Thymwood, vessels of Iuory, and of pretious wood, of brasse, yron and marble: her wares also of synamom, sweete odours, oyntmentes, frankinsence, wyne, oyle, fine flower and wheate, of beastes and sheepe, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and charyots, seruants and soules of men.</p>

But the Angell of the Lorde after that hee had shewde me the misterie of the woman, and of the beast that bare her, told mee that this whore or harlot Babilon, for her sinnes and abhominations committed, which were all ascended and come vp to heauen, shall haue a great fall, and be sore plagued and tormented in one day all at once, euen with death, sorrowe and famyne, and that shee shoulde bee rewarded double according to her workes, and drinke the dreegges of her own cuppe, and bee burnt with fire: for strong is the Lord which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempne her: yea, that they that hate the whore shall with one consente make her desolate and naked, and shall eate her fleshe, and burne her with fire, as God hath put in their heartes, to fulfill his will vppon her. That the kinges of the earth which liued in pleasure with her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so shall bewayle and lament her, when they shall see the smoake of her burning. And standing a farre off for feare of her torment, shall saye, Alas, alas, the great Citie Babylon, the mightie Citie, howe is thy iudgement come euen in one houre? The inhabitants and people of the world also shall runne out of her and crye out mightelye with a loude voice, and saye: Alas, alas, it is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon the great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: is fallen, and is become the inhabitation of diuels, and the holde of all foule spirites: and the cage of euery vnclean and hateful byrde.

for sorrowe and wante of their filthy gaine, shall stand a farre off from her, for feare of her tormente, and erye out and dispayre, weeping and wayling, and saye: Alas, alas, the greate Citie that was cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in fine linnen, purple, and scarlet, and gilded with golde and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious stone, and pearle howe in one houre are so great riches come to desolation. And all shipmen and trauaylers, by sea shall flye vp to the toppe of their mastes, to see her destruction, and shall crye out when they see the smoake of her burning, and cast dust vppon their heades, and saye alas, alas, what Citie in all the world was like vnto this great Citie: wherein all that had shippes on the sea were made rich by her costlynesse, howe in one houre is shee made desolate?</p>
                        <p>But contrariwyse, the Angelles tolde mee, that the Saintes and Martyrs, whome shee hadde slayne, shoulde greatlye reioyce in her destruction, and saye: O heauen reioyce of her desolation, and yee holye Apostles and Prophets tryumph in her ouerthrow: for GOD hath giuen your iudgement on her, &amp;c.

But he sayde vnto me: Behold, thou shalt conceaue &amp; beare a sonne, and nowe thou shalt drinke no wine nor strong drinke, neither eate any vncleane thing, for the childe shall be a Nazarite to God, from the birth to the day of his death.

Nowe then said Manoah, let thy saying come to passe: but how shall we order the childe, and doe vnto him when he is borne? The woman thy wife (quoth the Angel) must be ware of all that I sayd vnto her: shee may eate nothing that commeth of the vine tree, she shal not drinke wine nor strong drinke, nor eate any vncleane thing forbidden by the lawe.

When Potiphar heard his wife thus report of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph his seruant, whom he so much loued and trusted: hee being too light of credence so sone without further and better tryall, to beleeue the false and slaunderous reporte of his wife, beganne to waxe wroth with Ioseph, and nowe causlesse turned his good opinion of Ioseph in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ielosie, his loue into hatred, and his trust into tyrannie. For presently vpon his wiues suggestion, he apprehended Ioseph, and for the harlot his wiues sake, he cast poore innocent Ioseph in the prison, where hee lay fettered with yrons in the stockes, and was very euil intreated for the space of three yeeres, vntill by Gods prouidence, hee was deliuered by Pharao, king of Egypt. <hi>Gen. 39.7. &amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>When Benhadad king of Aram, had besieged Samaria so long, vntill the famine was wonderfull great: and that an Asses head was soulde for fourescore peeces of siluer, to eate for want of victualles, and the fourth parte of a kab of Doues dung was soulde for fiue peeces of siluer, to burne for lacke of wood: Beholde, as Iehoram the vngodly king of Israel was going vpon the wals of the Citie to looke vnto his affayres, there cryed a certaine woman of the Citie vnto him, and said: Helpe my Lorde O King, whose voyce being heard, the king began to waxe angrie, and in stead of comfortable wordes he being moued, gaue her reprochfull speeches, (thinking in deede she had called vnto him for that which he had not, namely for sustenance and victuals, whiche as then was very hard for him to giue, because they were all spent) &amp; sayd vnto her: Seeing the Lorde doth not succour thee, howe shoulde I helpe thee with corne or wine, or any other victual? for as thou knowest there is no such thinges left among vs. Then the woman answered, my Lorde O king, I aske of thee neither victualles, nor sustenaunce: therefore the king sayd vnto her againe: Woman, then what ayleth thee, and what wouldest thou haue?

And when the seuenth day came, he vp and tolde her the meaning of his ridell, because shee was so importunate vpon him. And when shee had learned it, shee went straite wayes and tolde it to her friendes and countreymen. So when the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day of the feast came or euer the same was set, they came to Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and declared vnto him his ridell, saying: what is sweeter then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? And what is stronger then a Lion? O well quoth Samson, if yee had not plowed with my heyfer, that is, vsed the helpe of my wife, yee had not founde out my redell. And so being very angry with his wife, that she had heereby caused him to loose the wager, hee was by her folly mooued first to take vengeance on the Philistines, and presently went and slue 30. of them in one of the fiue chiefest Cities called Ashkelon, and of the spoyle of them, gaue change of garmentes to them that had expounded his ridell. So when he had thus robbed Peter to pay Paul, he forsooke his wife &amp; her friends, &amp; went backe to his father Manoahs house in Zorah. And in the meane time, his wife was giuen to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion whom he had vsed as his friend: but within a while after, Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son came backe againe to Timnah, thinking to haue visited his wife, &amp; lien with her, and when he sawe that her father had giuen her to another and would not suffer him to go in to her, saying: I thought that thou hadst hated her, therefore gaue I her to thy companion. Is not her yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1693:153"/>
sister fayrer then shee? take her I pray thee in steade of the other. Samson then by his wiues father being thus moued againe the second time to take vengeance on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Philistines, said: Now am I more blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse then the Philistines, therefore will I do them displeasure, and bee auenged on them. And with that he went and got 300. wilde Foxes, &amp; turned them tayle to tayle, and put a fyre brande in the mids betweene the two tayles, and when he had set the firebrandes a fyre, hee sent the Foxes into the standing corne of the Philistines: and so burnt vp both the rikes of corne and hay that were reaped and gathered, and also the standing corne in the fieldes, with all the vineyardes and Oliues. Which fact so grieued the Philistines when they vnderstoode who did it, and wherefore, that for feare of daunger that els might come vnto them, and not for loue of Iustice, like wicked men in like malice and spite, they came vp to Timnah to his father in lawes house, and there burnt his wife that had forsaken him, and her father, and all that they had with fire likewise. Therfore in reuenge of which vilanie done this vnto his wife, Samson yet againe the thirde time went to be auenged on the Philistines, and slue them horsemen and footemen with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie plague. <hi>Iudg. 14.15.</hi>

For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The meale in the barrell shall not be wasted, neither shall the oyle in the cruise be diminished vnto the time that the Lorde send rayne vpon the earth, and so take away the drought which was the cause of the famine. So shee went and did as Eliah bad her, &amp; she did eate, so did he,

and her house for a certayne time, euen till hee had rayne and foode on the earth. The barrell of meale wasted not, nor the oyle was spent out of the cruise, according to the worde of the Lorde which he spake by the hande of Eliah: where we see that God receiueth no benefite for the vse of his saintes and seruaontes: but he promiseth and performeth a most ample recompence to the giuer for the same.</p>

Then shee being very sorowfull sayde to Eliah, what haue I to doe with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee to call my sinnes to remembraunce, and to slay my sonne? when Eliah heard his hostes thus burden him, he (being afrayde least Gods name shoulde haue been blasphemed and his ministerie contemned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God shoulde haue continued his mercies as hee had begunne them towardes her, especially while hee there remayned) sayd vnto her: Giue me thy sonne, and with that tooke him out of her armes and bosome, &amp; carried him vp into his chamber where he lay, and layde him vpon his owne bedde: And then called vnto the Lorde by feruent prayer, and sayde: O Lorde my God, hast thou punished also this widowe with when I soiourne by killing her sonne? So hee stretched him selfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the childe three times, and called vnto the Lorde, saying: O Lorde my God, I pray thee let this childes soule come into him agayne. And the Lorde hearde the prayer of Eliah, and the soule of the childe came into him agayne, and he reuiued. Then Eliah brought the child down out of his chamber into the house, and deliuered him to his mother, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: beholde thy sonne liueth. Nowe I knowe (quoth shee) that thou art the man of GOD, and that the worde of the Lorde in thy mouth is true: so harde a thing it was for her to depende on God, except shee sawe and was confirmed by a myracle. <hi>1.

And when on a time the Israelites in the quarrell of the Leuites wife, that was most vilanously abused in her bodie to death by certaine wicked men of the Beniamites as ye may read in her story, had almost destroyed all the whole tribe of Beniamin their brethren, man, woman, and childe in battell, and against these fewe that were left had made a rashe vowe, and othe among them selues, that none should euer after giue his daughter to any of the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamites to wife in detestation of the fact committed against that harlot the Leuites wife.

Then call her vnto me againe (said Elisha:) so she being come, as she stood at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doore, Elisha said vnto her at this time appointed according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a sonne: Oh my Lord (quoth she) thou man of God doe not lie vnto thine handmayd: so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman conceyued and bare a sonne at that same season, according to the time of life that Elisha had sayde vnto her. And when the child was growen, it chanced that he went out in the hot haruest time vnto his father and the reapers in the fieldes: where feeling his head ake sore with the heat of the sonne, he cried this vnto his father, and sayd: O my head, O my head, and with that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded his seruant to beare him home to his mother, who layd him in her lapp, but ere noone her child died as he lay in her lappe. Then she went vp and layde him on the bed of Elisha the man of God, &amp; shut the doore vpon him, &amp; went out to call her husband, and said, send with me I pray thee one of thy men, and one of thy Asses, for I will hasten &amp; rid to the man of God and come agayne: wherfore wilt thou goe to him to day said her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: sith it is neither new moone nor sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth day, for at such times the people are wont to resort to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets for doctrine &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>solatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                        <p>In Tekoah a citie of Iuda, sometimes built by Rehoboam king of Israel, and being sixe myles distant from Bethleem, there dwelt a certayne subtile or wise woman, whom Ioab Dauids captaine sent for to Ierusalem, of purpose to vse her for a meanes to reconcile Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, nowe out of Dauid the king his fathers fauour, and a banished man for killing his brother Ammon, that had defloured his sister Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar: And when she was come, he being also a very suttle man, taught her what to say, and how by way of a parrable or darke phrase of speech, she should describe vnto the king, the death of Ammon by Absolom, &amp; how she should best perswade the king to reconciliation, saying: I pray thee (quoth he vnto her) now put on mourning apparrell, and annoynt not thy selfe with oyle, but fayne thy selfe to mourne and to be as a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe woman, that hath now long mourned for the death of her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and goe to the king and speake vnto him after this manner.

The king seeing her in that woful plight, said presently vnto her agayne: woman, what ayleth thee? O my Lord (quoth she) I am indeed a widowe woman, whose husbande is lately dead: and thine handmayde had two sonnes, who stroue and fought so long together in the field, till the one slue the other, because there was none to part them.

At which time, because he was very sick &amp; weake, his wife Alexandra the Queene (like an honest and louing wife) went with him, fearing least he should dye by the way. And as hee encamped himselfe against the citie, and vrged it sore with assaultes, his sicknesse increased vpon him more and more. Wherfore, his wife perceiuing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was like to die, wept bitterly before him, and sayde: To whom shal I be so bold as to shew my face when thou art once dead? seeyng thou hast wrought such mischiefe against the Pharisies, whom all the lande fauoureth, and following their traditions, obey their institutions, If they shalbe disposed to wreek the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vpon me &amp; thy young children: for that you in your merrie mood, did hang vpon the gallous 800. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe Pharisies in Ierusalem, they shall haue ayde of all that dwell in the land.</p>

                  <p>The Queene did therefore as she was instructed of the king. And when she had wonne Ragaba, shee ioyfully returned to Ierusalem: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that gathered togeather the elders of the Pharisies, and spake to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the king had aduised her. The Pharisies hearing that the king was dead, and that his bodie was in their handes to doe withall what they list, they aunsweared the Queene, God forbid wee shoulde doe this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Lorde the annoynted of GOD.

The time that he raigned, was xxvii. yeeres.</p>
                  <p>After him raigned his wife Alexandra in his steede: for the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies after they had finished the seuenth day of the mourning, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the kingdome vnto her. Shee had two sonnes by the king, the elder was called Hircanus, the other Aristobulus. Hircanus was a iust man and a righteous: but Aristobulus was the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riar, and a man of prowesse: Besides that of a familier and louing countenaunce, hee fauoured also the learned men, and followed their instruction. But Hircanus his elder brother loued the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies. On a tyme therefore when the Queene sate in the throne of her kingdome, shee called the Auncientes of the Pharisies before her, honoured them, and commaunded to release and sette at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie all suche Pharisies as the king her husbande and her father in lawe, had cast in prison: and taking the Pharisies by the handes, shee commaunded all Israell to obey their ordinaunces. Then made shee Hircanus her sonne high Priest, and Aristobulus Liefete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt of the warres. She sent also to all the landes that her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande and father in lawe Hircanus had subdued, and demaunded

the noble mens sonnes for the pledges, whiche shee kept in Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. So the Lorde gaue vnto the Queene quietnesse from all that were vnder hir subiection: shee gaue also the Pharisies au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye ouer the learned sorte, putting them into their handes, to order at their pleasure. Whereuppon straight wayes they founde one Dogrus, a greate manne amongest the learned sorte, whome they slewe, and muche people besides of the Auncientes of that sect, so that the Sectaryes were in greate distresse. They gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues together therefore, and came to Aristobulus the Liefetenaunt of the warres, and with him they came to the Queene, saying vnto her, Thou knowest the enmitye, that is betweene vs and the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies, whiche hate thy husbande and father in lawe, yea, and thy children also: Wee were his men of warre that went with him in all his affayres, and ayded him: nowe thou hast geuen vs into their handes to bee murdered and banished out of the lande.

Hee will come and reuenge him of all the battell that thy hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande fought against him: Yea, the Pharisies will take his parte, and deliuer thee and thy children into his handes, that there shall not bee left vnto Hircanus the king, and his sonne Alexander thy husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, any name or remnant at all.</p>
                  <p>The Queene gaue them no woorde to aunsweare, whereat Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus her sonne was angry, and letted not to vtter to his mothers face: but shee woulde not heare him.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore Aristobulus counselled the Sectaries to goe their wayes and departe out of Ierusalem, to choose them Cities in the lande of Iuda, where they might dwell with their honoure, and not to suffer them selues to bee slayne vnder the Pharisies handes. Wherefore, departing from Ierusalem, they dwelte in the Cities of Iuda. Not long after this, it fortuned the Queene fell sore sicke, that shee was like to dye: Whereof, when Aristobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus hearde, hee feared least the Pharisies woulde make his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hircanus king, and at lengthe apprehende him: wherefore hee fledde awaye by night to the Cities of the Sadduces to bee their heade, and make warre vppon his brother, if hee woulde presume to raygne. Hee came therefore to the Prince of the Sadduces, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Galustius, who was a good manne of warre. And after he hadde gathered a stronge armie of the Saduces, his mother the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:1693:160"/>
Queene sent vnto him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee shoulde returne vnto her, which he would not doe, but rather went to warre vppon the nations that dwelt about him, where he wanne twentie Cities, and gotte him greate renowne thereby.</p>
                  <p>Nowe as the Queene his mother waxed sicker and sicker, the chiefe Pharisies came vnto her with her sonne Hircanus, weeping before her, and saying: howe they were afraide of her sonne Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus, who if he shoulde come into Ierusalem and take it, hee woulde deliuer them vp into the handes of the Sadduces. Unto whom shee aunsweared, I am as you see at the poynt of death, not able to talke muche with you: There is heere in my house greate trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that my husbande and my father gathered, and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes kinges of the posteritie of Chasmonani, take that vnto you, and make my sonne Hircanus king ouer you. If Aristobulus will perturbe him and make warre agaynst him, yee may wage men of warre therewith and succour him as you thinke good. And euen with this shee faynted and dyed, and was buried amongest her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, after she had reigned nine yeeres ouer Israel. <hi>Iosephus fol. 21. 22.23.24.75.</hi>

                  <p>There was another woman of this name called Alexandra, whiche was the daughter of Hircanus the king of Israel, and sonne to the afore named Alexandra: and when shee hearde that, her father Hircanus was taken prisoner, depriued of his kingdome, and ledde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way captiue by Antigonus into Persia, shee with her daughter Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimy that shee had by Alexander the sonne of Aristobulus her vncle, went towardes Rome, where by the way Herode mette with her and her daughter, and brought them agayne into the lande of Israell: where hee tooke Marimy her daughter to wife, and solemnized the marriage with her in the mount of Galilee, for there the chiefe of all Israell dwelt, and so became king of Ierusalem. Afterwarde, when her father Hircanus was released and came home to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem. Herode her sonne in lawe came out to meete him, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, and kissed him: after brought him into his house, and feasted him, daylie calling him his father before all menne, albeeit in his hearte, hee conspired to murder him: And that knewe Alexandra his daughter and mother in lawe to Herode, who opened it vnto Hircanus her Father: but hee woulde
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:1693:160"/>
not credite her at the first, till on a time hee perceiued the matter cleare to be so: then deuised he how to flie to Maloc king of Arabia, but before he could get away, Herode so handled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused &amp; put to death wrongfully, &amp; by this meanes Herod was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter established in his kingdome.</p>
                  <p>After hee had thus dispatched Hircanus his wiues progenitour, father of Alexandra his mother in law, and had deposed Haniel from the office of the high Priesthoode, and preferred his wiues bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aristobulus to that dignitie. Which he did to quiet his wife, and to fulfill his mother in lawes mynde. Notwithstanding this, Alexandra his wiues mother was not content nor satisfied, for the death of her father was such a greefe: but alwayes spake snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly to the king, that hee committed her to ward. Then she wrote to Cleopatra Queene of Egypt, and wife to Marcus Antonius a Noble man of Rome, declaring vnto her all the mischiefe that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode had done to the posteritie of Chasmonanie, and desiring her of ayde. To whom Cleopatra made this aunsweare, if thou canst finde the meanes to come to me secretly, thou shalt perceiue what I will doe for thee.</p>
                  <p>When Alexandra had read the letter, shee sent to Aristobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus her sonne the high Priest, shewing him that shee woulde flye to the Sea Iapho, and from thence woulde take shipping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Egypt, perswading him also to flie with her. We will (sayth shee) make two coffers, one for mee, another for thee: and wee will with rewardes allure our seruauntes to carrye vs out priuilye, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee may flye to saue our liues. This their deuise was peccey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of one of Herodes seruauntes, who foorthwith made the king priuye vnto it. The king commaunded his seruaunt that bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that when they did conueye their coffers, they shoulde bring them to him, whiche the seruaunt did. So when the coffers were brought to the kinges presence, hee caused them to bee opened, and tooke out Alexandra and her sonne Aristobulus, to whome the king spake sharpely, and rebuked them sore. But Alexandra aunsweared him againe as short, insomuche that the king moued with anger fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g awaye from her into his chamber, saying: It is better to sitte so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarye in a corner of the house, then with a brawling or scoulding woman in an open place. The king dissembled the matter, and shewed
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:1693:161"/>
outwardly no great displeasure whatsoeuer he did inwardly.</p>
                  <p>But a yeere after, the king fearing sore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Israelites woulde in the ende restore the kingdome vnto Aristobulus, and the children of their fathers, he perceyuing euery mans heart to be so inclined to Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stobulus for his vertue and godlinesse sake, wickedly deuised, and secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded at a feast made to Aristobulus, and all his Nobles, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of his owne seruants beeing disposed to goe and swimme in Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan: shoulde desire Aristobulus the young man, to goe and bathe with them in Iordan, and then and there to drowne him. So Aristobulus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing swimming with the kings seruants till sunne setting, when it began to be darke, they drowned him amongst them. Wherof when ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings came to the court, &amp; it was wel knowen that he was dead: all the people made great lamentation for him, but chiefly Marimy his sister, and Alexandra the young mans mother, she could in no wise be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Yea, and although she sawe the king himselfe also to weepe, and make great mone, for it repented him that he had done so wicked an act: yet all the people knew wel i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From that day forewardes there was perpetuall hatred betweene Alexandra and Marimy, and Riparim the mother of Herode and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumith her sister, that came of base and seruile blood. After this, Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumith on a time perceiuing that the king detested Marimy, tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to accuse Marimy of treason, and that shee woulde poyson the king her husband: which the king too lightly beleeuing to bee true, at her false report, commaunded Marimy to be brought foorth, and to be beheaded in the citie. And as she was brought foorth vnto the market place of the citie, all the women of the citie followed her: Alexandra her mother also cursed and rated at her saying, come out, thou y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hast abhorred &amp; conspired against the Lord. Alexandra wept also, as though it had byn for the wickednes that her daughter had committed, thinking surely to please the king by that meanes, and to bleare his eyes, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture he might suffer her to liue til she might haue opportunity to poyson him: but all would not helpe, for Marimy for all this was guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse beheadded, and put to death by the king her husband, as you may reade more in her history.</p>

For Marimy cast in their teeth to their faces, that they were not of the seede of Israel: but prophane, vnholy, and of base byrth. Notwithstanding, Herode loued Marimi as his life, wherefore hee woulde neuer displease her as long as shee liued, nor say so much to her, as why sayest thou so to my mother and sister? whiche his hot loue was afterwarde turned to hate, for when Herode went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Octauian the Emperor and his maister against whom he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired and rebelled with presentes to be reconciled vnto him, as hee set forwardes, hee called Ioseph his brother in lawe, and commaunded him that if Octauian the Emperour put him to death, as hee doubted, then he shoulde poyson Marimi his wife, for sayde Herode: it is not seemely for kinges, that any meane and base man shoulde marrie with a kinges widowe, and sleepe with her vpon a kinges bedde.</p>
                  <p>So when Herode was gone on his iourney in the meane while Ioseph her brother in lawe, disclosed vnto, Marimi all that the king her husbande had commaunded him, and how that if it so fortuned, him to be put to death by Augustus the Emperour, that he shoulde poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son her: Wherevpon Marimi conceiued a greater hatred towardes the king her husbande, insomuch, that when the king was returned in safetie, sound, and with honour also from Octauian Augustus the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and that all his men and whole housholde reioyced greatly, Marimi onely shewed no good countenance of gladnesse, no not when the king him selfe tolde howe greatly he was magnified and honoured
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:1693:164"/>
of Octauian: but alwayes shee was sadde. Salumith the kings sister, perceiuing that Marimi so vexed the king, shee tolde him howe Ioseph her husbande had lien with Marimi while he was with Augustus. But Herode (say what shee could) gaue no credite to her wordes, knowing that shee enuied Marimi, and spake of malice, vntill at lengh he asked the cause of Marimi, why shee reioyced not as other did when he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in safetie from Augustus, but was euer sadde, whiche shewed her to haue some rancor and malice in her heart towardes him. Shee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, thou hast saide heretofore, that thou louedst mee aboue all thine other wiues and concubines: yet thou diddest will Ioseph thy sisters husbande to poyson mee. When Herode heard this, hee was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly abashed that Ioseph had disclosed his secrete, and beganne to mistrust with him selfe that which Salumith had before told him, that hee had slept with his wife in deede, and vpon that had detected that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, therefore he departed out of his place in a great anger and rage. Whereby Salumith perceiued that he detested Marimi, and therefore shee accused her further, suborning false accusers and forgers of lies, to witnesse that Marimi woulde haue poysoned the king, whereof shee had diuers presumptions also by her countenaunce. Shee added more ouer, if thou (saith shee to the king) let her scape thus, shee will speedily destroy thee, and bereaue thee of thy kingdome. The Lawe giueth this counsell, if any man goe about to murder thee, preuent him, and slay him first: with this and such like wordes, shee so moued the king, that he commaunded to bring Marimi foorth, and to be beheaded in the high streete of the citie. And as shee was brought foorth vnto the markette place of the Citie, all the women of the Citie followed her: Alexandra her mother also cursed and rayled at her, saying: come out, thou that hast abhorred thy husband, and conspired against thy Lord, which she did not of malice but of pollicie to pacifie the kinges wrath against her daughter, whom she knewe to be innocent of that fact &amp; wrongfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> story of Alexandra appeareth. But Marimi thus going to execution, held her peace, &amp; looked neither to the right hande, nor to the left, nor yet feared death any thing, knowing, that shee was innocent in deede and thought, and therefore God woulde render her a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde in the worlde to come. Wherefore shee bared her necke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, and they cut off her head, shedding the innocent blood. But God made no delay in punishing the same: for there fell a sore plague and pestilence in the house of Herode, so that his chiefest seruaunts, his
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1693:165"/>
Noble women and concubines died sore thereof: Yea throughout all Iudea raigned the pestilence vehemently: which affliction all Israel knewe well inough chaunced vnto them for the blood of Marimi.</p>
                  <p>They cryed therefore vnto the Lorde, saying: wilt thou for the offence of one man, deale so cruelly with the whole congregation? And the Lorde tooke pitie therefore vppon the Lande, and withdrewe the plague from the people at their earnest petitions. The king repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him also, that hee had so rashly shedde the innocent blood of so deere a wife without cause, and loue of her so grew in his heart, that he was sicke and at deathes dore for griefe of minde. This Marimi had by Herode two sonnes, the one called Alexander, the other Aristobulus. Read more in Alexandra her storie. <hi>Ioseph.</hi> fol. 35.40.42.43.44.45. 46.56.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Miriam,</hi> was a certayne notable riche woman at Ierusalem of a Noble house, her dwelling was beyonde Iordane: who when shee perceyued the warres to growe more and more in the tyme of Uaspasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an the Emperour, and the siege at Ierusalem to be very great &amp; sore, shee came vp with her neighbours to Ierusalem, bringing with her not onely her men seruauntes and women seruauntes, and all her whole familie: but also her goodes and riches, which were very great. When the hungar was grieuous at Ierusalem, and the sedicious went from house to house to seeke meate, they came also to this womans house, and tooke away from her by force all that euer shee had, &amp; left her nothing remayning. By this meanes shee was oppressed with verye great hungar, so that shee wished her selfe out of the worlde, but her time was yet come to die. Wherefore that shee might slake her hungar, and sustaine her life, shee beganne to scrape in the chaffe and dust for beastes dounge, but coulde finde none.</p>
                  <p>Shee had one sonne, and when shee sawe the famine waxe greater and greater vpon her, shee layde aside all womanhood and mercie, and tooke vpon her an horrible cruelty. For when she heard her boy weepe and aske for meate, which shee had not to giue him, shee sayde vnto him: What shall I doe my sonne? For the wrath of God hath inuironed the whole citie, in euery corner thereof famine raigneth: without the citie the sworde killeth vp all, within we stand in feare of the seditious: our enemies preuaile without, in the Towne are fires, burninges, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:1693:165"/>
of houses, famine, pestilence spoyling, and destroying, so that I cannot feede thee my sonne. Nowe therefore my sonne, if I shoulde die for hunger, to whome shoulde I leaue thee being yet a childe? I hoped once, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou shouldest come to mans state, thou shouldest haue susteined mine age with meate, drinke, and cloth, and after when I shoulde die, to bury mee honourablie, like as I was minded to burie thee, if thou shouldest haue died before mee: But nowe my sonne thou art as good as dead alreadie. For I haue no meate to bring thee vp with all: because of this great famine and crueltie of the enemies both within and without. If thou shouldest die nowe amongst other, thou shouldest haue no good nor honourable tombe as I woulde wishe thee.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I haue thought good to chuse thee a sepulchre euen myne owne bodie, least thou shouldest die, and dogges eate thee in the streets.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore bee thy graue, and thou shalt bee my foode. And for that, that if thou hadst liued and growne to mans state, thou oughtest by right to haue nourished mee: Nowe feede mee with thy fleshe, and with it susteyne mine age before that famine deuoure thee, and thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bee consumed.</p>
                  <p>Render therefore vnto thy mother that whiche shee gaue vnto thee, for thou camest of her, and thou shalt returne into her. For I will bring thee into the selfe same shape in the which the breath of life was breathed into thy nostrelles: Forasmuch as thou art my welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sonne, whom I haue loued alwayes withall my strength, bee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meate for thy mother, an ignominie and reproch to the Sedicious, that by violence haue taken away our foode. Wherefore my sonne heare my voyce, and sustayne my soule, and my life, and goe to thy ende that is determined for thee by my handes, thy lotte bee in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden and Paradise: bee thou meate for mee, and a rebuke and shame to the Seditious, that they may bee compelled to say, Lo a woman hath killed her sonne, and hath eaten him.</p>
                  <p>So when shee had thus spoken to her sonne, shee tooke the child, and turnyng her face away, least shee shoulde see him dye, shee killed him with a swoorde, and after cutte his bodie into certayne peeces, whereof some shee roasted, some shee sodde, and when shee had eaten of them, shee layd vp the rest to keepe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:1693:166"/>The sauour of the fleshe rosted when it came out into the streetes to the people, they sayde one to another: see, here is a smell of rostmeate: Which thing came to the knowledge of the sedicious at length, who went into the house of the woman, and spake roughly vnto her, why shouldest thou haue meate to liue with, and wee die for hunger? The woman then made them an answere, and sayde vnto them: Bee not displeased, I beseeche you, with your handmaide for this, for you shall see I haue reserued part for you. Sitte you downe therefore, and I will bring it you, that you may taste thereof, for it is very good meate. And by and by shee layd the table, and set before them part of the childes fleshe, saying: Eate I pray you, heere is a childes hande, see heere his foote and other partes, and neuer reporte that it is any other womans childe but mine owne onely sonne that yee knewe with mee, him I bare, and also haue eaten part, and parte I haue kept for you. Which when shee had spoken, shee burst out, and wept, saying: Oh my sonne, my sonne, how sweete wast thou to mee whiles thou yet liuedst, and nowe at thy death also thou art sweeter to mee then honie. For thou haste not onely fedde me in this most grieuous famine, but thou hast defended mee from the wrath of the sedicious, wherewith they were incensed towardes mee, when the smell of the meate brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my house? Nowe therefore are they become my friendes, for they sit at my table, and I haue made them a feast with thy fleshe.</p>
                  <p>After shee turned her to the seditious, and badde them eate and satisfie them selues. For why (saide shee) shoulde yee abhorre my meate which I haue set before you? I haue satisfied my self therewith, swhy therfore do you not eate of the flesh of my sonne? Tast and see how weete my sonnes fleshe is, I dare say you will say it is good meate.</p>
                  <p>What needeth pitie? Ought yee to bee more moued therewith then a woman? If yee will in no wise eate of the sacrifice of my sonne, when as I haue eaten thereof mee selfe, shall not this bee a shame for you, that I shoulde haue better heart, and greater courage then you? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde I haue prepared a fayre table for you, most valiant men, why eate ye not? Is it not a good feast that I haue drest for you? and it was your will that I shoulde make you this feast. It had been my part rather to haue been mooued with pitie of my sonne, then yours: and howe chanceth it therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye are more mercifull then I? are not ye they that spoyled my house, and left me no kinde of foode for mee and my sonne? are not yee they that constrayned mee to make you this feast, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:1693:166"/>
the great hunger that I haue? why then eate yee not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when as yee were the authours and the causers that I did this deede?</p>
                  <p>The Iewes hearing this matter, were wonderfully smitten into saddenesse: Yea, euen the gouernours of the Seditious beganne to stoupe when they heard of this, so that they all in a maner desired death, they were so amazed at this horrible acte. Many therefore of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people stale out in the night foorth of Hierusalem with all their substaunce to the Romanes campe, and shewed Titus of this: who wept thereat, and was sory for the matter exceedingly, holding vp his handes to heauen, and crying, Thou Lorde God of the worlde, God of this house, to whome all secretes are knowen, whiche also knowest my heart, that I came not against the Citie as desirous of warres, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of peace, which I euer offered them: but yet the Citizens there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of euer more refused it, although I oftentimes intreated them. And when they destroyed one another by their ciuill discention, I woulde haue deliuered them, but I founde them alwayes like most fierce and cruell beastes, nothing sparing them selues: And this mischiefe is come nowe so farre that a woman hath eaten her owne fleshe, being driuen therevnto by most extreeme necessitie.</p>
                  <p>I haue hearde, and my forefathers haue tolde mee all the power that thou hast exercised in times past towardes them and their fathers, howe thy name dwelt amongst them. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And nowe Lorde God, &amp;c. if so bee thou wilt not deliuer this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into my handes, I will gette mee hence from these most wicked men, and flie away to saue my life, least I also perishe in their sinnes when thou shalt ouerthrowe them, as thou diddest Sodome and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morre &amp;c. For with hardened heartes they say, why shoulde wee not be like to our fathers in crueltie? For our father Abraham when as he had but one only sonne, he went to sacrifice him to the Lord, whom in deed I doe not reprehend for this fact: for why? I knowe not the misterie thereof, albeit I marueile howe he had no pitie on his sonne. I haue heard also of a certayne king of theirs (called Gefta) who the same day hee went forwardes to the warres, made a vowe to God that he would offer a sacrifice, if hee shoulde haue good successe in his warres: And when hee returned from the warres, hee offered to God his onely
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:1693:167"/>
daughter, and so perfourmed his vowe that he had vowed vnto God. And hereby I knowe they are men of a stubborne spirite: for what so euer it giueth them in their heades to doe, that they thinke must needes bee done, and they are a noughtie people, and most heynous sinners. Wherefore except thou wilt deliuer them vnto mee, I will giue ouer the warres. For I will not be slayne with them without all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>When Titus had thus sayde, hee battered the wall of Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem with an yron Ramme, and cast it downe: Then came foorth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nobles of the Saduces vnto him, and made peace with him.</p>

                     <hi>Pheroras</hi> wife hauing had a vyall of poyson, whiche Antipater bought as hee went to Rome, and sent vnto her husbande to keepe for him till his returne: In the meane while her husbande Pheroras dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And when Antipater came home agayne from Rome: Pheroras wife and hee fell at variaunce, insomuch that shee obiected vnto hym, that hee was the cause that her husbande Pheroras was banished the kinges presence, the sorrowe whereof was his death. On the other side Antipater went about to accuse her, sowing discorde betweene her and the king, to sturre him agaynst her. Hee suborned also a certaine Eunuche or gelded person to goe vnto Herode the king, and enfourme him, howe that, at what time as hee tooke displeasure with Pheroras his brother, and banished him his presence, Pheroras procured a strong poyson, and gaue it to his wife, commaunding her to destroy the king therewith. The king hearing this was wroth with the Eunuch, and sayde: I searched for that venome long agoe, when it was noysed that my housholde seruauntes woulde haue giuen it mee to drinke, but I coulde not finde the thing to bee true: Yea I haue been too rashe in such matters. For I put my wife Marimi to death without a cause, and Alexandra my mother in Lawe, with my two children.</p>
                  <p>When Antipater hearde that the king credited not the Eunuche, hee made suite to the king to sende him to Octauian the seconde tyme: for hee was afrayde for the viall that was in Pheroras wiues house.</p>
                  <p>Hee had written also with his hande, howe that hee sent it, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therewith to poyson the kings sonnes children: but hee that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth a pitte for other, oft times falleth into it him selfe, and desiring
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:1693:167"/>
the king to sende him, hee let him goe.</p>
                  <p>After this the king commaunded to make searche, if the Eunuches woordes were true or no: He sent first for Pheroras housholde ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, examined them whether euer they coulde perceyue that Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roras was in minde to hurt him: They all sware no.</p>
                  <p>Then the king commaunded to scourge them very sore: but they confessed nothing, although some dyed vnder their handes in the examination. Some he ordered with diuers kindes of tormentes, of some hee caused to plucke out all their teethe. And as hee had scourged a certaine woman seruaunte whiche had beene verye trustie to Pheroras, at length when shee coulde no longer stande for strokes, shee cryed out and sayde: The holy and blessed God reuenge vs of Rostios the kinges wife, which is the cause of this. The king hearing these wordes, badde let her alone, shee will disclose all, Then spake shee, Antipater made feastes euery foote for thy brother Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roras and him selfe: And as they eat and dranke, they deuised howe to poyson thee, especially when as Antipater was going to Octaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</p>
                  <p>For they sayde, except wee destroy him hee will destroy vs, as hee hath done all the children of this house. Moreouer, hee loueth the children of his sonnes that were put to death, whiche growe apace, and it is possible hee may alter his minde, and make one of them king. Antipater also saide to thy brother, The king makes as though hee hee were much my friende: but I trust him not. Hee gaue me (sayth hee) an hundred pounde weight of golde, but all that satisfieth not mee.</p>
                  <p>When the king heard this, hee told howe he had giuen Antipater this golde secretly. The woman sayde moreouer, There is yet a vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of strong poyson in my mistresse house, that thy sonne sent out of Egypt: With that the king sent straightwayes to Pheroras wife, that shee shoulde bring him the vyall of poyson her owne selfe: but when shee espied the kinges Eunuches come to fetch her whether shee woulde or no, shee gate her vp to the toppe of the house, and cast her self down headlong to kill her self: because she would not see the king, nor abide his torments: Yet shee died not thereof. Wherevpon the kinges messengers brought her in a horselitter, and set her
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:1693:168"/>
before the king: Then shee confessed vnto him, howe Antipater his sonne had conspired with Pheroras his brother to kil him with a stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g poyson that hee had bought in Egypt, and sent it to Pheroras her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande to keepe, when hee went to Octauian: And howe that Pheroras being at the point of death, repented him thereof, charging that wee shoulde neuer giue that venome to Antipater, but powre it out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the grounde, that the king might not bee poysoned therewith: and I did, as he badde me, cast it out all, saue a litle that I kept in the glasse bottome: For I euer feared that which is nowe come to passe. Then at the kinges commaundement the viall was brought forth before him, and there was a litle of the venome left, wherefore they gaue better credite to her woordes: so the king was content, and bad his phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons heale her, and shee recouered. <hi>Ioseph. 55.56.57.</hi>
