            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou shall haue here, gentill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, a small dialoge betwene the Lawyere &amp; Diuine: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if there lacke suche eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, suche dryfte of argumentes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance of reasons, as parauenture ware requisite, and as ye shall desyre: yet we shall moste entierly pray you, that where we be nat sufficient to supplye the same, to content your selfe with this our rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, declarynge the pure truthe alone: whiche you shall be right sure to fynde in this poore treatyse. For here haue you no newe allegatyon of mans inuention or imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but onely taken of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of god, of the counsels and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the churche vniuersall, of mooste auncient popes and other holy doctours wryttinges, with the factes and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryties of blessed men besyde, withoute wrythinge or wrestynge of any of them: beyng taken of whome and of none other I am sure you will say it is to be estemed
<pb facs="tcp:10109:3"/>
for a most assured truthe. Prayenge you most benigne reders that tho some wolde saye that they be nat truely alleged, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to gyue credence to so many appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vniuersities whiche affirme our alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to be true: than to the asseuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other, specially of some fewe affectionate persones, whiche do or may endeuour to denye the same. And nowe therfore to tell you the very truthe, this same is the grounded cause why this ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell worke beareth his name, whiche is the Glasse of truthe. For it is plainly the same clere glasse, within the whiche ye shall see and beholde (if ye loke well and leysurely in it) the playne truthe of our mooste noble and louinge princis cause: whiche by vnmete and vnkynde hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge hathe hytherto had so ouerlonge a staye. The whiche doutlesse if we well considre, is moche more our hynderance than his. For his lacke of heyres male is a displeasure to him but for his life tyme: as lackinge that whiche naturally is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syred of all men to haue childerne. But our lacke shall be permanent so longe as the worlde lasteth: excepte that god pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide.
<pb facs="tcp:10109:3"/>
For tho we haue a female heyre, whiche is bothe indued with moche ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue &amp; grace in many dootes and gyftes, yet if a male might be atteyned it ware moch more sure, if we well perpende and pondre many vrgent &amp; wayghtie causes. Amongest whiche this one, is depely to be forsene, that if the female heyre, shall, chaunce to rule, she can nat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue longe without an husbande. whiche by goddes lawe, muste than be her gouernour and heed, and so finally shall directe this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme. But who that shulde be, with the contentement of the subiectes, me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, it were harde to excogitate. For proximitie of blode, is to great a lette to some, otherwise mete for that purpose, except we wolde be so beestly to put our necke eftsones in the snare of this erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious prohibited errour, whiche is, and hathe ben alwayes detested by the moste parte of all the famous clerkes of christen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome. The punisshement whereof, were to terrible to be suffered, and also to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable to be harde of, emonges chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten folke. On thother side, to other some, it were daungerous, leste we shulde
<pb facs="tcp:10109:4"/>
make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> superiours to vs, ouer whome, we clayme superioritie, seynge the manne must rule the woman. Others outwarde mete personages our sklender wittes can nat comprehende. And as touchinge any mariage within this realme, we thinke, it were harde to deuise any condigne and able person, for so highe an enterprise, moche harder, to finde one, with whome the holle realme wolde &amp; coulde be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to haue him ruler and gouernour. Wherfore we thinke the establysshement of titles is nat so surely rooted nor yet so entierlye mainteyned by the female as by male. Whiche well consydered syns the vnion of all titles do remayne and be collocate in him onely, we oughte of duetie (if oure wittes may thereto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende) to excogitate all wayes to vs pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, howe we might atteyne the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of heyres male.

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse to the intent that ye myghte well perceyue that this lawe was trulyer to be obserued in the mysticall sense / than in the litterall, and that mooste specially nowe by vs christen men: the smalnes of the payne whiche foloweth it, declareth it full well, as by the text folowynge you may well perceyue.

               <p>There be many mo specialtes than these: that go nere the matter. For some men of great house say / and (as I am enfourmed) depose vpon theyr othe: that prince Arthur dyd report hym selfe vnto them,<note place="margin">Prince Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurs owne reportes.</note> that he had carnally knowen her. And that at diuers tymes, to some at one tyme / to some at a nother: so that his sayenges were many times reiterate. Whyche me thynketh gyuethe moche greatter faythe, in so moche that it is not to be thought, that al these tymes he shulde speke for ostentacion and bostynge of hym selfe onely. For at some tyme of these it doth appere by attestacion of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible folkes, wherof some were his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes nere about him at that tyme: that he spake it for mere necessite, demaundynge and desyrynge drinke incontinently vpon his great labours, in the mornynge very erely to quenche his thyrste: answerynge whan the question was asked hym, why sir and be ye nowe so drye? Mary if thou haddeste bene as osten in Spayne this
<pb facs="tcp:10109:34"/>
nyghte as I haue bene: I thynke verely thou woldest haue ben moche dryar. A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother thinge there is more, whiche hath a meruelous apperaunce in it to declare that she shulde be knowen by prince Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thure: and that is this. Incontinent after his dethe the name of a prince belonged to hym that is nowe our souerayne lorde and kynge, excepte his brother had chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: &amp; so without creation or any other solemnite streight waye so to be called therby. Whiche if it shulde nat so haue folowed, shulde haue ben a mere iniurye illated by his father to hym: without some other meruaylous great considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So it was his brother beinge dede, vpon suspicion that she hadde ben with childe, and beynge also certifyed by the princes counsell, that they and she bothe thoughte the same:<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> the name of prince was differred from our souerayne lorde that nowe is by the space of a moneth &amp; more, in whiche tyme it was likely the truth to be knowen. And so me thinketh there can be no more veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nor almost a playner trial of her to be knowen, than this: beinge with al well considered howe
<pb facs="tcp:10109:34"/>
wel auisedly the noble king his fader dyd always procede in all his actes &amp; dedes. Ye &amp; a thirde there is also, wherby it can nat be denied but that this her oste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacion &amp; affirmation is nothinge true. And that now is euidently proued by an instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t called a Brefe, whiche she by her selfe or her proctour produced in publyke iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the Legates in her defence: bycause our soueraynes counsell founde fautes in the bulle, whiche were sufficient in lawe (as lawyers do affirme) thoughe the pope might dispense (as he may nat i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dede) to annihilate &amp; fordo the mariage bitwene the king and her. For where one of the fautes, whiche the kinges counsell fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, was that after the dethe of prince Arthur, in suinge for dispensation, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned a bull / wherof the suggestion was not true: Beinge in one place (as it was saide) in the bull <hi>Forsan cognitam,</hi> as who sayeth, may fortune knowen. Whiche maketh a doubte of that thynge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che she knewe well ynoughe before. And thereby it may well be coniectured, that she feared to telle the trewthe, lest that the pope, perceyuynge that she had bene
<pb facs="tcp:10109:35"/>
knowen by prince Arthoure, wolde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue dispensed with this lattre ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryage. Or elles in dede if she had nat be knowen, she neded nat to haue putte in, these termes at all. And thereby emonges other thinges the kinges coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selle thoughte, that this bulle was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repticious and noughte: bycause the trewe meanynge of the supplycatyon was nat purely and trewely declaredde in the same. She thanne fearynge that by this faulte and other, whyche were founde in the sayde Bulle, she shulde fayle of her purpose: dydde accordynge as tofore is sayde, in her defence exhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byte this brieffe: thynkynge thereby to take away al these doubtis, whiche were founde in the Bulle, and specially that of <hi>Forsan cognitam.</hi> But in this (as scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, <hi>obscurati sunt oculi eorum,</hi> Both her eies &amp; her cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sels were blynded.

               <p>It can not be denied, but that she knoweth it best of folke nowe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. But prince Arthur whan he lyued knewe vtterly as wel as her grace.

And assuredly to speke, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible by due and laufull profe to proue true this her sayenge by her selfe in dede, at this houre: seynge that she hath bene knowen syns. And as for wordes, it is to open in lawe, that the husbandes attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyon makynge for the mariage is to be preferred to the womans deniall in that case. So that if there were no more but prince Arthurs owne sayenge, the lawe willeth that credytte shulde be gyuen to him &amp; nat to her. And if she wold go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to proue it by recordes, it is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
