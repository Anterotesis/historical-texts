            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> French Author's Preface <hi>Rendred into Engliſh,</hi> Giving an account of the deſign of this Treatiſe, and its publiſhing.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>EGypt</hi> is a Province ſo pregnant in prodigies, that, from the earlieſt times, thoſe, whoſe curioſity excited them to the knowledge of excellent things, have made it one of the principal objects of their conſiderations. <hi>Pliny</hi> names thirteen famous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who had written before him of the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> which are one of the things admir'd therein; and <hi>Herodotus</hi> deſirous to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that Countrey in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, before he came to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Narration of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:62433:6"/>
which <hi>Cambyſes</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> had made into it, and whereto the deſign of his Hiſtory led him, ſpent in that digreſſion all his <hi>Euterpe,</hi> that is to ſay, one of the nine Books, wherein it was his intention to comprehend what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had been remarkable in the World to this time. All the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who have ſince written in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine,</hi> or any other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage known in <hi>Europe,</hi> have not omitted treating of the ſame ſubjects, according to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they have had to do it, as being likely to prove the nobleſt Ornaments of their Works.</p>
            <p>As concerning the <hi>Arabians,</hi> though the Treatiſe whereof I here publiſh the Tranſlation be ſhort enough, yet have they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed very amply of it in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Books: and it is not long ſince I ſaw in the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
<pb facs="tcp:62433:6"/>
Library two Manuſcripts in Folio of great bulk, and cloſe written, which treat only of the rarities and ſingularities of <hi>Egypt;</hi> at leaſt, if the Titles, which have been put thereto, by ſuch as have examined them, be true; for I have not yet had the opportunity to conſider them at leiſure. And therefore I ſhall not give any punctual account of them, calling to mind that at the beginning of this very Manuſcript, out of which I have made this Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome Italian had written theſe words as it were for its Title, <hi>De Negromanzia, e dell' ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:62433:7"/>
effects of their Magick, which they had the impudence to compare with the Divine miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters then are part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Book, but not all, as being one of the things, which many ages ſince had raiſed admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in thoſe who conſidered <hi>Egypt,</hi> but not the onely one, nor the principal in a Country, where the Earth, the Waters, and the Air out-vy one the other, in affording extraordinary ſubjects of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Philoſophers upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, and whoſe Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have ſignalized themſelves by their prodigious ſtructures, and by the invention even of Philoſophy it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> is it ſelf a ſtranger in the place of its ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we credit the conjectures of it of Philoſophers, who have
<pb facs="tcp:62433:8"/>
attentively viewed and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; it came thither from a Countrey ſo remote, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of men could never ſettle any Commerce for the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fruits from thoſe places, whence nature conveys them the very ſoil whereby they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. The air there is in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſerenity, never diſturbed at any Seaſon of the Year with Snow, Hail, Rain, Lightning, or Thunder. The Waters there riſe to a prodigious height during the greateſt heats of Summer, when they are elſewhere loweſt, or dryed up; and in Winter, when they are every where either fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen up, or over-flown, they there g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>id gently below their ordinary courſe. The ſurface of the Earth is ſpread with a pleaſant verdure, with ſo ſweet a temperature of the Air, that the faireſt Springs of
<pb facs="tcp:62433:8"/>
other Countries come not near it. In the Moneth of <hi>March,</hi> the Harveſt ready to be cut down, guilds the pregnant Fields, which are deveſted thereof before the Moneth of <hi>April.</hi> And in the Moneths of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> the ſame Fields are changed into ſo many Seas, and the Cities and Villages into ſo many Iſlands, by a fortunate inundation, which ſpares the Inhabitants the trouble of tilling and manuring them, as muſt of neceſſity be done elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> have no more to do but to Sow the Seeds therein, when the Waters are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len away, and ſlightly to ſtir the ſlime which is ſpread thereon, that they may be covered, which they did heretofore, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates by driving Herds of Swine after the Sowers. Thus do they get the Fruits of the moſt fertile
<pb facs="tcp:62433:9"/>
piece of earth in the Univerſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to uſe the terms of the ſame Author, moſt eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without any trouble; after they have gathered the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Waters, by a yet more eaſie fiſhing, or rather as <hi>Aelian</hi> expreſſes it, by an Harveſt of Fiſh, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which lie ſcattered on the ſlime in the midſt of the Fields.</p>
            <p>Theſe natural prodigies have alwaies engaged the greateſt wits in an enquiry into their cauſes, which are reducible onely to two heads. For the ſerenity of the Air proceeds no doubt from the nature of the adjacent and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries and Waters, which are not apt to ſend thither any vapours, which might be condenſed into Rain, Hail, or Snow; nor yet any mineral exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which might cauſe thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:62433:9"/>
and lightning: and the other Miracles, which are ſeen by the Raies of that delightful Sun, are the effects of that admirable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which keeps the Inhabitants of that Countrey in ſuch quiet, after it hath brought them the ſoil which is to ſuſtain and nouriſh them.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of this, it is to be obſerved that <hi>Aegypt</hi> is only a Plain, or rather a ſpacious Valley, reaching in length from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North</hi> from the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> or a little beyond it, to the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, for the ſpace of about two hundred and thirty Leagues; and in breadth, from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Mountains, which are its limits, one towards <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the other towards <hi>Africk,</hi> but not alwaies at an equal diſtance one from the other. For at the
<pb facs="tcp:62433:10"/>
Northern extremity, along the Shore of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, that diſtance is about ſix ſcore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues; above the places where <hi>Heliopolis</hi> heretofore ſtood, and where now <hi>Cairo</hi> is, about fifty leagues diſtant from the Sea, it diminiſhes ſo for the ſpace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeventy leagues, that the two Mountains are not above ſix or ſeven leagues diſtant one from the other. Above that ſpace they dilate again, and the Countrey grows wider, even to its Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dional extremitie, which makes the upper <hi>Aegypt,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Thebais.</hi> Thus is <hi>Aegypt</hi> naturally divided into three parts, which may be called <hi>Upper,</hi> the <hi>Lower,</hi> and the <hi>Middle.</hi> In the <hi>Middle,</hi> which is much narrower then the others, and which our Author calls <hi>Gize,</hi> as much as to ſay the <hi>paſſage</hi> was the City of <hi>Memphis,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62433:10"/>
near the Weſtern Mountain, on which not far thence there are ſeveral Pyramids, and thoſe of the moſt ſumptuous. In the <hi>upper Aegypt</hi> was heretofore the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City <hi>Thebes,</hi> which had a hundred Gates, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called <hi>Dioſpolis;</hi> and <hi>Syene</hi> ſeated directly under the Tropick of <hi>Cancer;</hi> ſo that the day of the Summer Solſtice the Sun at noon ſhined to the bottoms of Wells, and ſtreight and perpendicular Pillars made not any ſhade; and <hi>Elephantina,</hi> beyond which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently began <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and <hi>Copta,</hi> whence there was a way to the Red Sea, the ſhorteſt and eaſieſt of any along that Coaſt, by which there were brought on Camels abundance of <hi>Indian</hi> Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which were afterwards em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqu'd on the <hi>Nile;</hi> and the little <hi>Cataract,</hi> where <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaies the
<pb facs="tcp:62433:11"/>
Mariners fell down from the top to the bottom with their Boats, in the preſence of the Governour of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to make him ſport; and the Lake of <hi>Maeris,</hi> with two Pyramids in the midſt of it, each ſix hundred foot in height, three hundred under water, and three hundred above; and the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> yet more prodigious then the Pyramids. In the <hi>Lower Aegypt</hi> are the mouths of the <hi>Nile,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the two moſt diſtant one from the other make the <hi>Delta,</hi> which is a Triangular Iſland, the <hi>Baſis</hi> whereof is the ſhore of the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi> Sea, and the two ſides the two arms of the <hi>Nile,</hi> which come to thoſe mouths. <hi>Cairo</hi> is above the <hi>Delta,</hi> towards <hi>Arabia,</hi> near the place where heretofore <hi>Heliopolis</hi> ſtood. The <hi>Arabians</hi> now call it <hi>Maſre,</hi> a name com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and which we
<pb facs="tcp:62433:11"/>
have ſeveral times rendred the <hi>ancient Metropolis of Aegypt,</hi> in the <hi>Mahumetan Hiſtory. Alexandria</hi> is on the Sea-ſide near the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern mouth. The <hi>Nile</hi> flows in one ſingle Chanel through the midſt of the plain, from <hi>Eliphan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> to the point of the <hi>Delta,</hi> which is about fifty leagues from the Sea; there it is divided into two, afterwards into ſeveral branches, before it falls into it.</p>
            <p>Their conjecture, who held <hi>Aegypt</hi> to be a new Land, and come from ſome remote part, was that heretofore the ſpace between the two Mountains from <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantina,</hi> or a little below it, to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> had been a gulph of the Sea, like, and in a manner parallel in its ſituation to that which is called the Red Sea, and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Countries from the <hi>North</hi> towards the <hi>South,</hi> as the Red Sea
<pb facs="tcp:62433:12"/>
enters into them from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North;</hi> and that in proceſſe of time the abundance of ſlime, which the <hi>Nile</hi> brings down when it is overflown, had filled that ſpace, and framed therein the land which is now ſeen there, and which had no reſemblance to thoſe of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> which are adjoyning thereto; whence they imagined it a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and come from far. <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> was of opinion, that that collection of ſlime might have been made in leſs then twenty thouſand years; taking haply his conjecture according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it from <hi>Homer</hi>'s time to his own. For <hi>Homer</hi> affirms, that the Iſland of <hi>Pharos</hi> was in his time at a far greater diſtance from the Continent then it hath been ſince, as <hi>Pliny</hi> hath obſerved; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring conſequently thence, that
<pb facs="tcp:62433:12"/>
               <hi>Aegypt</hi> was augmented and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced nearer the Sea.</p>
            <p>What I think miraculous in this, is, that the Inhabitants of a Countrey which in appearance began not till a long time after the reſt, ſhould count the Years of their Antiquities in a far greater number then other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons their Neighbours, and ſhould make in their Countrey ſumptuous Structures, which yet could not preſerve the memorie of their Authors to a time, when other Nations were but in a manner beginning to entertain thoughts of doing ſomewhat of that kind, though they have laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a long time after the ruine of thoſe which were made much later. And yet all this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks depends on the ſame cauſe, which is the excellency of the ſoil of that Province, and the facility
<pb facs="tcp:62433:13"/>
of cultivating it; in as much as having always been able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a far greater number of men then were requiſite about the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, the Princes, who were poſſeſſed thereof, were obliged to find out other employments for the greateſt part of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and this occaſioned the early invention of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> by thoſe who were inclined to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the wonderful things of nature, and to ſpend the reſt allowed their bodies in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intellectual faculties of their ſouls in thoſe noble labours. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks thus of it, when he ſays that they ſtudyed Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy in <hi>Aegypt</hi> ſooner then any where elſe, becauſe there they ſooneſt permitted the Prieſts to live in a commendable exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from labour; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. As for others,
<pb facs="tcp:62433:13"/>
who could only work with their hands, in regard the mild tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the Air diſpenced with their employing themſelves in many profeſſions neceſſary elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to ſecure mens bodies from its injuries, it was requiſite they ſhould be employed in ſuch works as might declare the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfulneſs and magnificence of their Kings. Whence I conceive <hi>Pliny</hi> juſtly blameable for the character he gives theſe Miracles of the World, when he ſays they are <hi>Regum pecuniae ſtulta oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio;</hi> and that after he had ſaid that thoſe who had written of them before him differed about the Names of the Kings who built them, he ſhould add theſe words, <hi>Juſtiſſimo caſu obliteratis tantae vanitatis authoribus.</hi> For if all the works which contribute nothing to the ſupply of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
<pb facs="tcp:62433:14"/>
of humane life are follies. <hi>Pliny</hi> himſelf is in hazard to be eſteemed to have done many; and this conceit of his is in my judgement much different from that of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who (as <hi>Cicero</hi> relates) affirms, that among the ſeveral ſorts of perſons who met ordinarily at the great general Aſſembly of all <hi>Greece,</hi> thoſe who came not thither upon any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor out of deſign to get any thing, but only to ſee what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, were the honeſter people; <hi>Genus vel maxime ingenuum:</hi> whom he therefore compared to the Philoſophers.</p>
            <p>Theſe great Princes therefore are methinks rather to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned, that their Names were already forgotten above fifteen hundred years ſince, after they had made for the eternization thereof the Works which are to
<pb facs="tcp:62433:14"/>
this day ſeen and admired, rather then they are to be blamed for having done ſuch noble things. And this oblivion alſo no doubt proceeds from the excellency of their Countrey, which having been envyed by all Foreiners who have known it, hath always been one of the firſt preys of the Conquerours, and by that means ſo often changed Maſters, that it is no wonder the memorie of the moſt Ancient ſhould be loſt; whereas the Princes, who once ſettled themſelves therein, were well ſatisfied with that poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thought not of diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Neighbours. True it is, that <hi>Strabo</hi> affirms, that in <hi>Thebais</hi> above <hi>Dioſpolis,</hi> and <hi>Memnon</hi>'s Temple, he ſaw on the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Tombs of forty Kings, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisks, on which there were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings graven, which mentioned
<pb facs="tcp:62433:15"/>
great Conqueſts made by thoſe Kings, as far as <hi>Scythia, Bactriana,</hi> and the <hi>Indies. Herodotus</hi> affirms the ſame of <hi>Seſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtris;</hi> but it may be doubted whether theſe great Conquerours were natural <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> or <hi>Strangers,</hi> who among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries had ſubdued <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> for <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was no <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> though he had his Tomb at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and had been the Founder of that great City.</p>
            <p>However it were yet this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the inclination of the Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi> for great Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures is very ancient, ſince the <hi>Pharao's</hi> who Reigned in the times of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and who probably are comprehended by <hi>Herodotus</hi> under the ſingle name of <hi>Pheron,</hi> had it, as may be ſeen by the complaints of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> againſt them, when they
<pb facs="tcp:62433:15"/>
made them work hard in the making of Brick, and paid them ill. That <hi>Pheron</hi> of <hi>Herodotus</hi> was ſuch a Perſon as the <hi>Pharao's</hi> are repreſented to us; for he was no Conquerour, but an inſolent and impious Prince, and the <hi>Pharao's</hi> were ſuch as the <hi>Arabian</hi> expreſſion at this day affirms it, who ſay, <hi>To play the Pharao;</hi> that is, to demean himſelf inſolently and tyrannically: whence haply comes the <hi>French</hi> word, <hi>Faire le Fanfaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Antiquity of the Sciences in <hi>Aegypt</hi> there is no doubt to be made of it, ſince <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> learn'd Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there in a School, where they ſtudied thirteen years, and which was ſhewed at <hi>Heliopolis</hi> as a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s time, who affirms he ſaw it there; and adds, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> never knew exactly of
<pb facs="tcp:62433:16"/>
how many Days, Hours, and Minutes the Year conſiſted, till they had read thereupon the Books of the Prieſts of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which to that end were tranſlated out of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Tongue into the <hi>Greek;</hi> which argues (by the way) that even at that time there were <hi>Greek</hi> Verſions made of Books writ in other Languages, contrary to the opinion which ſome Learned Men ſeem to have lately taken up.</p>
            <p>That ancient Language of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> was written from the right hand to the left, after the manner of the <hi>Oriental</hi> Tongues, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> hath obſerved: wherefore the <hi>Coptick</hi> writing now uſed from the left to the right ſeems rather to have come from the <hi>Greek,</hi> then the <hi>Greek</hi> from it, whatever <hi>J. Kircher</hi> tells us of it, in his <hi>Prodromus Copticus.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62433:16"/>
As to the ancient Religion of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> though the Book we here Tranſlate in ſeveral places mentions their Idols, <hi>Strabo</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that in his time there was not any Figure in their Temples, at leaſt any repreſenting a Man's body, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: whence it might be ſuſpected that our Author took the Images of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches for Idols, ſince it may be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly obſerved, that he ſeems in ſome places to put the Croſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame rank; which be it ſaid without derogation from the approved Worſhip due to both. The ſame <hi>Strabo,</hi> (and before him <hi>Herodotus)</hi> would make us believe that <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and what they call <hi>Exciſion,</hi> which is the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Women, were ever uſed in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and that the other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who obſerved it, as the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62433:17"/>
the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> the <hi>Syrians,</hi> nay the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves took it from them; which is not without ſome ground; For Circumciſion was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned <hi>Abraham</hi> till after his travelling into <hi>Aegypt. Strabo</hi> obſerves it as a ſingularity, that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> brought up all the children that were born to them, which was not done by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who expoſed ſome, nay ſometimes killed ſome of them, as we have it from <hi>Terence</hi> in his <hi>Heautontimorumenos.</hi> This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and indulgent cuſtom, no doubt proceeded alſo from the goodneſs and fertility of their Countrey, which was ſuch, that the children were no great charge to their Parents, and which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed its Inhabitants with greater mildneſſe of diſpoſition, and tenderneſſe towards ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:62433:17"/>
were ſo nearly related to them, then the <hi>Greeks</hi> had upon the like occaſions.</p>
            <p>The ſame Authors relate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other remarkable things of the ancient Religion of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the manners of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; all which have met with ſeveral changes by the Conqueſts which have been made of that Province at ſeveral times, ſince that at the very firſt, which is come to our knowledge, to wit, that of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> 'tis queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe the Ceremonies of their Superſtitions were very much altered by the perſecution of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes,</hi> which came to that height as to kill <hi>Oxe Apis,</hi> which paſſed for a God at <hi>Memphis,</hi> as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures did elſewhere; though all thoſe which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced by the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, were not adored in
<pb facs="tcp:62433:18"/>
the quality of <hi>Gods,</hi> but many of them only in the quality of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Animals,</hi> whom it was not lawful to injure. And it is very probable, according to <hi>Cicero</hi>'s conjecture, that at firſt they were all accounted only ſuch, in aſmuch as thoſe who then governed the People thought fit for ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to preſerve ſuch Beaſts as much as might be, as being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous for ſomething; and that in proceſſe of time the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Ignorance of thoſe who comprehended not the true cauſe why they were ſpared, came to imagine ſomething Divine in them; which in my judgment proceeded from the demeanour of the Prieſts towards other men, whom they blinded what they could, eſpecially ſeeing the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood belonged to certain Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and was not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb facs="tcp:62433:18"/>
to all, no more then the other principal Functions of the Commonwealth, as Arms, Arts, and Agriculture; for that made every one abſolutely ignorant of thoſe things which belong'd not to him, and whereto he never had any right to aſpire; and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned their being many times exerciſed by ſuch as had not any natural diſpoſition thereto, and conſequently were not much capable thereof.</p>
            <p>This Myſterious Carriage of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts extended not onely to things concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but even to ſuch as were indifferent, which they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated not without much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For <hi>Strabo</hi> affirms, that the 13 Years, during which <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> continued at <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> were not ſimply ſpent by them in learning Aſtronomie,
<pb facs="tcp:62433:19"/>
but in courting the favour and friendſhip of the Prieſts, that they might be thereby induced to teach them ſomething of what they knew in that Science. If they were ſo ſhie in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating to others what they had obſerved in the Heavens, and which any others might have ſeen as well as they; it may well be imagined they much more carefully concealed the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of their Countrie: ſo that it is not to be admired there is ſo little come to our knowledge of what paſſed there before the Conqueſt made by the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Nay, if the <hi>Ethiopions</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there before, and that for a long tract of time, as <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> mentions, it is likely that even then the Sources of the <hi>Nile</hi> were not unknown, nor the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of its Inundation. And who
<pb facs="tcp:62433:19"/>
knows whether in the time of <hi>Herodotus</hi> the Prieſts knew not more of thoſe things then they would communicate to him? For if they had relations of a Voyage of 4 Moneths, that is, above 1200 Leagues, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſcending, partly upon the <hi>Nile,</hi> partly on the ſides of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> thoſe who had made it muſt have paſſed all the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> and found the ſource and origine of the <hi>Nile.</hi> But they ſaid, that in thoſe Countries the <hi>Nile</hi> flowed from Weſt to Eaſt, and not from South to North, as it did in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> which is not conſonant to the reaſon given by <hi>Herodotus</hi> himſelf of the overflux of that River; nor the Modern Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphies, according to which the Sources of the <hi>Nile</hi> are far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Equinoctial Line.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62433:20"/>
This then paſſing for certain, with a length of the courſe of the <hi>Nile</hi> equal to that attributed thereto by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> methinks there might be a reaſon found out of its overflowing in <hi>Aegypt</hi> more probable then thoſe which many have hitherto given thereof. For what makes the overflux mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous is, that it happens, as we have already ſaid during the great heats of Summer, when all other Rivers are at the loweſt or dryed up: which occaſioned a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that it proceeds from a cauſe different from that of others, which manifeſtly depend on the Rains which fall, and the Snow which ordinarily melts in great abundance towards the end of Winter, at which time the <hi>Nile</hi> is at the loweſt. Some therefore have been of opinion, as <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> relates, that the <hi>Nile</hi> overflows
<pb facs="tcp:62433:20"/>
in Summer, becauſe then there come into <hi>Aegypt</hi> continually cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Winds called the <hi>Eteſian</hi> from the Northern Coaſt, which obſtruct its courſe, and ſo croud up its Waters, depriving them of the freedom of falling into the Sea, as they ordinarily do, as the reflux of the <hi>Ocean</hi> daily does the Rivers which fall into it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers attributed the cauſe of it to the <hi>Ocean,</hi> out of which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the <hi>Nile</hi> to take its origine; but they explicated not after what manner this was done. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affirmed, that this overflux proceeded from the Snow, which they pretended was diſſolved in Summer upon the ſides of the <hi>Nile. Herodotus</hi> refutes all theſe conjectures, and then gives his own opinion, which is, that the <hi>Nile</hi> coming from ſome very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the <hi>South,</hi> that is,
<pb facs="tcp:62433:21"/>
from a Countrey from which the Sun is far diſtant in Summer, when it is very near <hi>Aegypt</hi> its courſe, which at its coming out of the ſource is always equally big, comes then quite to <hi>Aegypt</hi> without loſing any thing of its fulneſſe, in regard the Sun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes nothing or very little of it: whereas in Winter it decreaſes much by the way, for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon; which is that the Sun being then directly upon its wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters devours a great part thereof. <hi>Strabo,</hi> who thought not this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Herodotus</hi> more probable then the others, recurs to that which he ſays had been obſerved by <hi>Homer,</hi> when he called <hi>Aegypt</hi> (that is to ſay the <hi>Nile</hi> in <hi>Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> terms) a River falling from Heaven,
<q>
                  <l>—<gap reason="foreign">

               </q>
He would therefore have the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
<pb facs="tcp:62433:21"/>
of the <hi>Nile</hi> proceed from the Summer-rains, which (ſaith he) are frequent in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Relation who have ſailed on the Red Sea as far as the Countrey which produces <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> as alſo of thoſe who have been at the Hunting of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. The Relation of the Monk <hi>Coſmas,</hi> inſerted by the moſt Learned and Ingeniouſly curious perſon Monſieur <hi>Theve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> in the Firſt Part of his <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> ſays methinks the ſame thing. But, beſides that the ſources of the <hi>Nile</hi> are at a far greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance then is ſuppoſed by that reaſon alledged alſo by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in its proper place, there is no great likelihood that the rains ſhould be ſo frequent in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in a Countrey next adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where it never rains, and more Southerly then
<pb facs="tcp:62433:22"/>
it. Whence it comes that at this time the ableſt Philoſophers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to find out ſome other cauſe of ſo conſiderable an effect, and Monſieur <hi>de la Chambre</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others by an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſagacity hath found out one, for it in the Bowels of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whoſe Nitrous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtirred by the heats of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are in his judgement capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of cauſing the Waters of that River to riſe up to ſo great an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflux, as we ſee by experience that it does. This opinion, when we ſhall have comprehended the ſubtile Diſcourſes, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the excellent remarks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that great great perſon confirms it, will doubtleſs be found the moſt likely to be true.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Chapelain,</hi> to whom moſt of the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> do now give an account, not onely of their
<pb facs="tcp:62433:22"/>
works, but alſo of their deſigns, out of the confidence they have of his excellent judgment and ſincere advice, told me not long ſince, that the moſt Learned and moſt Eloquent Monſieur <hi>Voſſius</hi> hath a Treatiſe ready on the ſame Subject, wherein we are like to meet with many things yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us.</p>
            <p>To make it appear then that I have alſo made ſome reflections on this Miracle, I ſhall here ſet down the reaſon I have imagined to my ſelf for it, which does not contradict <hi>Homer,</hi> though it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees not with <hi>Strabo;</hi> for it will haply ſuffice thoſe who may not have the leiſure to examine ſuch as are more ſubtile. I obſerve then in the firſt place, that to my thinking it is affirmed by <hi>Maci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that the riſings of the <hi>Nile</hi> are framed above <hi>Aegypt.</hi> For to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:62433:23"/>
the end of his forty eighth <hi>Chaliph,</hi> he ſays that the <hi>Nile</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very low in the time of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that Prelate was ſent by the <hi>Muſtanſer, Choliph</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to the King of the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> who upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty having cleared the paſſage of the Water, it roſe in <hi>Aegypt</hi> three Cubits in one night, and came to its height. I ſuppoſe next the two propoſitions by me already alledged, That the ſources of the <hi>Nile</hi> are far beyond the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial Line; and, That its courſe thence into <hi>Aegypt</hi> is in length above twelve hundred leagues, that is fourteen of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred: I ſuppoſe further, that at the Sources of the <hi>Nile,</hi> as in many other places, the Waters are higher in Winter then in Summer, according to what is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>F. Maffaeus</hi> in his firſt
<pb facs="tcp:62433:23"/>
Book of the <hi>Hiſtory of the Indies,</hi> where he has this paſſage; <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſit ad oſtium ingentis Fluvii, qui exipſis</hi> Nili <hi>fontibus originem tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hens, Zaires ab incolis dicitur; ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tanta aquarum vi, praeſertim hyeme, ſeſe in Oceanum infert, ut prodatur in octaginta millia paſſuum ab eo vinci mare.</hi> I ſuppoſe moreover, that the Waters of the <hi>Nile,</hi> when they are high, advance within the Chanel wherein they flow at about the rate of four leagues a day, according to what obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have made upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. For thoſe who have ſeen the <hi>Nile</hi> overflown in <hi>Aegypt</hi> have aſſur'd me, that its courſe is about the ſame rate of ſwiftneſſe as that of the <hi>Seine</hi> when it is in the ſame condition at <hi>Paris.</hi> Now the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Seine,</hi> and the Rivers falling into it, according to my computation, when they are
<pb facs="tcp:62433:24"/>
riſen, make about the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of way every day. For at <hi>Montereul</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> where I writ this, we have a ſmall River which is of that number, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which there come Waters, when it is high, from about four leagues diſtance, though its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary current comes but from the Spring of <hi>Ternant,</hi> diſtant from it but a league and a half. When this little River riſes of a ſudden by a ſtorm, as it happens often, and that ſometimes even in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the Waters are up but one day at <hi>Montereul;</hi> which argues that thoſe which come laſt are a day in running the four leagues whence they come. There paſſes by <hi>Cernieres,</hi> which is but half a league from the ſame place, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſmall River, into which there come Waters from a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance double to the other;
<pb facs="tcp:62433:24"/>
whence it comes that they are up two days, whereas they are but one at <hi>Montereul.</hi> In the laſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of the <hi>Seine,</hi> which was great and ſudden enough at the end of Winter in the Year 1665, by reaſon of the abundance of Snow which was diſſolved in a ſhort time, I obſerved, being then at <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Waters began to riſe the 18th. day of <hi>February,</hi> and continued till the end of that Moneth; after which they nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly decreaſed till the 10th. of <hi>March;</hi> which diſcovers that the laſt-arrived were twenty days coming from the places where the Snow was diſſolved. Thoſe places I conceive to be about fourſcore leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> and conſequently thoſe Waters had advanced about four leagues a day.</p>
            <p>All this ſuppoſed, I ſay for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb facs="tcp:62433:25"/>
that the Waters which cauſe the overflowing of the <hi>Nile</hi> this day being the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> were got together in the places where its courſe began about a Year before, whether oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by Rain or Snow melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Wherein there is nothing Miraculous or extraordinary. For at that time it was Summer in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as it is this day; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently at the ſame time it was Winter in thoſe Places, where the current of the <hi>Nile</hi> begins; ſince the Sources of it are at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance beyond the Equinoctial Line, where the Seaſons are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to thoſe which are on this ſide it. The Waters therefore were then about thoſe Sources higher then at any other Seaſon: but having fourteen or fifteen hundred leagues to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ere they got to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> after
<pb facs="tcp:62433:25"/>
the rate of about four leagues a day, they were about a year by the way; and conſequently there could not be an overflux of the <hi>Nile</hi> in that Province ſooner then now. And if it be true that the <hi>Ganges</hi> overflows alſo in Summer, as <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and Modern Relations ſeem to affirm, and that conſequently it is now in the ſame condition in the <hi>Indies</hi> as the <hi>Nile</hi> is in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> the cauſe may haply be the ſame. For its courſe being but half the length of that of the <hi>Nile,</hi> there needs but ſix Moneths for the Waters to get from the Sources to their Mouths, it being ſuppoſed thoſe of the <hi>Nile</hi> take up a whole Year. Now it was Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſix Moneths before at the Sources of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> which are on this ſide the Equinoctial Line; as it was a Year ago at the Sources of the <hi>Nile,</hi> which are beyond it.
<pb facs="tcp:62433:26"/>
The ſame is to be ſaid of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Menam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the long continuance of the overflux of the <hi>Nile,</hi> which is a hundred days according to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> or rather ſix Moneths ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame Author in another paſſage, where he ſays that in his time the water flowed out of the <hi>Nile</hi> into the Lake <hi>Myris</hi> or <hi>Moeris</hi> during the ſpace of ſix Moneths, and returned out of the ſame Lake into the <hi>Nile</hi> at the ſame place whereat it had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into it, during the other ſix Moneths of the Year; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance (I ſay) hath no other cauſe according to this poſition, but that which prolongs the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations of other Rivers. For it proceeds partly from the length of time that the Snow is diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the Waters falling, and partly from the different diſtance
<pb facs="tcp:62433:26"/>
of the place from which they come into the Chanel of the <hi>Nile</hi> after the diſſolving or falling. For thence it comes, that ſome get a long time after others from the place of their Rendezvous, and conſequently they come in like manner into <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee alſo in all other Rivers ſomething like the overflowings of the <hi>Nile.</hi> For many times the <hi>Seine</hi> for example is high and overflows at <hi>Paris,</hi> when no rain has fallen thereabouts, nor any Snow diſſolved; and it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſome days after the Rain is paſt, or the Snow diſſolved, when the weather is fair and clear, that its overflux is in its greateſt force and height.</p>
            <p>Moreover, That the Waters which cauſe the augmentations of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and its Inundations in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> come from the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb facs="tcp:62433:27"/>
the ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me which they bring along with them, and which hath made ſome conjecture, that it is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſeem to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie it. For the Waters which come from running Springs by ordinary Chanels are not muddy. It may alſo methinks be inferred from the ſame ſlime, that thoſe Torrents force their way through cultivated and manured Lands; for the Waters which fall from the Sky upon Deſert and Until<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led places are pure and clear in their deſcent thence. If this be true, with the conjectures we have mentioned before, it muſt follow that the Meridional parts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> were inhabited and cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before <hi>Aegypt</hi> was in the World; and that being granted, if the Nitre of <hi>Aegypt</hi> be of the nature of our Saltpeter, which is framed of old Manure amaſs'd,
<pb facs="tcp:62433:27"/>
and fermented a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it might ſeem to be rather an effect then a cauſe of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of the <hi>Nile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But haply we have ſaid too much of the <hi>Nile</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> in a Preface, which was to ſerve only for an Introduction to what is ſaid thereof by our Author, of whom the Reader might expect we ſhould give ſome account, though we have nothing to ſay of him, but only what may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured by the Reading of his Book; according to which he was (as I conceive) of <hi>Cairo,</hi> that is to ſay, of <hi>Maſre;</hi> for thus is that Famous City called to this day by its Inhabitants, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved: and the name of <hi>Cairo,</hi> under which it is known in <hi>Europe,</hi> came to it from that which the <hi>Mugazzoldinil,</hi> after he had conquered <hi>Aegypt,</hi> cauſed to

            <p>The eſteem which the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have at this day for his work ſufficiently appears in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the beauty of the Copy, out of which we have made this Tranſlation, and which was communicated to us by the late Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Library<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, by the favour of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> who amidſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite cares for what concerns the Glory of his Majeſty, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his Subjects, is ſome times pleaſed to think on our <hi>Arabian</hi> Muſes, and forgets not our labours in the diſtribution of the Favours which he obtains from his Majeſty, for thoſe who
<pb facs="tcp:62433:29"/>
ſeriouſly apply themſelves to the nobleſt kind of Learning. The Manuſcript of the <hi>Onirocrit Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman,</hi> whereof we have lately publiſhed the Tranſlation, was put into our hands by Monſieur <hi>de Montmor,</hi> principal Maſter of Requeſts, a Perſon as Eminent for his great Wit and rare Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as his Quality. I am glad to make this Diſcovery, for their ſatisfaction who were deſirous to know whence I had it, and that it might be an acknowledgement of the kindneſſes I have received from that Perſon upon that and divers other occaſions.</p>
            <p>But to return to our <hi>Aegypt:</hi> Were there nothing butthe Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or rather the Fable, of <hi>Gebirus</hi> and <hi>Charoba,</hi> and the Nymph <hi>Marina,</hi> which is about the middle of this Work, I ſhould not repent me of the Tranſlation
<pb facs="tcp:62433:29"/>
of it; for I little imagined to find in a <hi>Muſſulman.</hi> Author any thing ſo much allyed to the witty Fables of the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Poets, as that Narration is, which made me reflect at the Tranſlation of it on the midſt of the fourth Book of the <hi>Odyſſes,</hi> and the end of the fourth Book of the <hi>Georgicks.</hi> I have made the Title to my Tranſlation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the propoſal of the Author, for it is not in the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Manuſcript.

            <p>The <hi>Pyramids</hi> ſeveral times mentioned in it are expreſſed in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue by two Names, to wit <hi>Birba,</hi> which I have uſed in ſeveral places; and <hi>Haram.</hi> The word <hi>Birba,</hi> and

<pb facs="tcp:62433:30"/>
on the midſt of it; the differences of length and breadth being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where equal between them, as alſo the depth or thickneſſe: ſo that the whole <hi>Pyramid</hi> is only a ſquare blunt point, the four ſides whereof are Stairs, and the upper extremity is the leaſt in length and breadth of all the Platforms whereof it confiſts. Which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues in my judgement, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore there were ſome <hi>Coloſſes</hi> or <hi>Obelisks</hi> placed on them, as it were on their Pedeſtals, according to what <hi>Herodotus</hi> expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms of the two built in the midſt of the Lake <hi>Moeris.</hi> The height of every <hi>Pyramid</hi> is equal to the ſide of its Baſis, according to the ſame <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who aſſigns that of <hi>Cheops</hi> eight hundred foot in length, as many in breadth, and as many in height, ſo that it is as 'twere in the form of a

The Prieſt replied, It is in ſuch a Sign, ſuch a Degree, ſuch a Minute. Then he put the ſame que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to another; and when all had anſwered, and that he knew the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Stars, he addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the King, and ſaid thus to him; It is requiſite that you do ſuch a thing to day, that you ſend an Army to ſuch a place, that you clothe your ſelf after ſuch a manner, that you ſpeak at ſuch a time; and ſo of all he thought fit to be done in all the Kings Affairs, and in all the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom. The King writ down all the <hi>Cater</hi> ſaid, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62433:35"/>
whatever he diſapprov'd. Then he turn'd to the Artiſts, and ſaid thus to them; Grave thou ſuch a Figure on ſuch a Stone; and, Plant thou ſuch a Tree; and to another, Make thou a Geometrical Draught of ſuch a Work: and ſo to all from the firſt to the laſt. Immediately they all went every one to his Shop, and beſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do the works enjoyned them, exactly following the deſign propos'd to them by the <hi>Cater.</hi> They ſet down that day in a Regiſter the Works performed therein; and the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was folded up, and kept in the Kings Treaſury. Their Affairs were diſpatch'd according to this order: then the King (when he had any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair) aſſembled the Prieſts without the City <hi>Memphis,</hi> and the People met together in the Streets of the ſaid Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Then they made their entrance one after another in order, the Drum <note place="margin">Effects of of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts.</note> beating before them to bring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together; and every one made ſome miraculous diſcovery of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and Wiſdom. One had, to their thinking who look'd on him, his Face ſurrounded with a light like that of the Sun, ſo that none could look ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62433:36"/>
upon him. Another ſeem'd clad with a Robe beſet with Precious ſtones of divers colours, green, red or yellow, or wrought with gold. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came mounted on a Lion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd with Serpents like Girdles. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other came in cover'd with a Canopy or Pavilion of light. Another ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſurrounded with Fire, turning about him ſo as that no body durſt come near him. Another was ſeen with dreadful Birds perching about his Head, and ſhaking their wings like black Eagles and Vultures. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other made appear before him in the air dreadful and terrible perſons, and winged Serpents. In fine, every one did what was taught him by the Star he ſerved; yet all was but Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Illuſion without any reality: inſomuch that when they came up to the King they ſpake thus to him; <hi>You imagin'd that it was ſo or ſo, but the truth is that it was ſuch or ſuch a thing.</hi>

whereof are beyond all likelihood. He liv'd before the Deluge, which he by his Science foreſaw; whereupon he commanded the <hi>Doemons</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied <note place="margin">A Caſtle built by Spirit.</note> him to build him a Palace beyond the Equinoctial Line, which the ruines of this Univerſe could not reach. They built the Caſtle ſeated on the deſcent of the mountain of the Moon, which is the Caſtle of Braſs, where are the Brazen Statues, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber LXXXV; out of the Throats whereof iſſues the Water of the <hi>Nile,</hi>

The Spirits having built him that Caſtle, he had the curioſity to ſee it, and make his abode therein. To that end he ſate in a Pavilion made purpoſely with much artifice, and the Spirits carried him on their ſhoulders to the Caſtle; where having conſider'd the excellency of the Structure, and beauty of its Walls, with the Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and the Paintings that were about it, and the Figures of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62433:37"/>
Bodies, and divers other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things; for in the greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of the night people ſaw clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without Torches. There were Tables ſet and ſpread with all ſorts of Meat, yet none perceiv'd to ſet them there; ſo all ſorts of Drinks in veſſels of Marble, Gold, and Silver, which he made uſe of; yet were they not increaſed or diminiſhed. In the middeſt of the Caſtle there was a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern of Water congeal'd into Ice, whereof the motion might be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through that part which was fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen; as one ſees through a Glaſs what is contained in it. Having conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all this, he was aſtoniſhed thereat, and immediately returned into <hi>Egypt;</hi> where he left for his Lieutenant and Succeſſour his Son <hi>Gariac,</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his Subjects to him, and the Government of the Kingdom; and then he return'd to the Caſtle, and continued there till he died. He is thought to be Author of the Books of the <hi>Coptites,</hi> out of which they take their ſtories, and all that is to happen till the end of the World.</p>

This Princeſs appear'd to men in divers forms as ſhe pleaſed her ſelf.

This cuſtom continued conſtantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, till <hi>Nabuchodonozor</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran <hi>Egypt.</hi> This Princeſs cauſed alſo to be made a <hi>Ram</hi> of a hard red Stone, and to be placed on a Pedeſtal of the <note place="margin">Her Ram.</note> ſame.

This Mill-ſtone as it were turned with the <hi>Ram</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and juſt motions.

When therefore any enemy came to aſſault <hi>Egypt</hi> this <hi>Ram</hi> turned as the Mill-ſtone, and ſtopp'd towards that ſide that the Enemy was coming, and at the ſame time that Cock crew.

When therefore the <hi>Ram</hi> ſtopped of any ſide, and that they were aſſured that the King of that Countrey was in the Field, they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gate of that Houſe, and went to look for the Figure of that King, which immediately fell a ſhaking; whence they inferred that he had a deſign to attaque <hi>Egypt.</hi> Then thoſe Guards took the Halberds they had with them, and Swords made by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and kept in that Houſe, and fell a pricking that Figure with thoſe Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds, and to cut it with thoſe Swords, and thereupon the Army of that King which came to ſpoil the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> fell into ſuch diſorder, that the Souldiers killed one another, ſo that not one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and the King was forced to return without doing any thing.

            <p>As to the Prieſts who were in <hi>Egypt</hi> after the Deluge, there were a great number of them.

them till the like time again, and then he gave them Commands and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, yet ſo as that they ſaw him not with their Eyes. After a long time thus paſſed, he ordered to be built a Tower of Silver Gilt, and to be embelliſhed with ſeveral Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments; then he began to ſit on it in a moſt Magnificent and Mageſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal form, and to ſpeak to them. After that he went and ſate before them in the Clouds in a Humane form; then he abſented himſelf from them, ſave only when he diſcovered to them his Figure in the Temple of the Sun when the Sun entred in <hi>Aries,</hi> and ordered them to take for their King <hi>Garim</hi> the Son of <hi>Cophtarim,</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that he would not return any more to them; wherein they obeyed him.</p>

               </note> 'Tis alſo ſaid that he built the Pyramids of <hi>Behanſa,</hi> where the women were in favour of his Daughter, and that he there erected

Among others he ordered four Pyramids to be made on the four ſides of each Gate, and cauſed to be ſet on the Eaſtern Gate a Tower in the form of a Turret or Steeple, on which there was the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a <hi>Black Eagle;</hi> and on the <note place="margin">The City of the Black Eagle.</note> Weſtern Gate another Tower like the former, with the Figure of a <hi>Bull;</hi> on the Maritime Gate the like Tower, with the Figure of a <hi>Lyon;</hi> and on the outer or Southern Gate another ſuch Tower, with the Figure of a Dog. He ſent into theſe Figures Spirits that ſpoke; ſo that when any Stranger came into that City, at what Gate ſoever he entred, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure upon it made a noiſe, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants knew thereby that a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was come into their City, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately they ſeiz'd on him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he were. He planted there alſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62433:43"/>
a Tree which ſhaded the whole City, and bore all ſorts of Fruits. He alſo raiſed in the midſt of the City a high Watch-tower, the heighth whereof was fourſcore Cubits, according to the meaſure of that time; and on the top of it a little Turret, which every day aſſum'd a different colour till the ſeventh day, after which it re-aſſumed its firſt colour, wherewith it filled the whole City. About this Watch-tower he diſpoſed a great quantity of Water, wherein there was bred abundance of Fiſh. All about the City he ſet Taliſmans, which diverted all inconveniencies from the Inhabitants; and he called it the City of the <hi>Jovians,</hi> that is, Enchanters. There was in it for him a great Tower for the exerciſe of the Sciences of Magick, wherein he cauſed Aſſemblies to be made. It was ſeated on a mountain oppoſite to the City.

               </note> were firſt built in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Hiſtorians
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62433:43"/>
relate, that there was a King named <hi>Saurid,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sahaloc,</hi> three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before the Deluge, who dreamt one night that he ſaw the Earth overturned with its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, the Men caſt down on their faces, the Stars falling out of the Heavens, and ſtriking one againſt the other, and making horrid and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cries as they fell. He thereupon awoke much troubled, and related not his Dream to any body, and was ſatisfied in himſelf that ſome great accident would happen in the World. A year after he dreamt again that he ſaw the Fixed Stars come down to the earth in the form of white Birds, which carried men away, and caſt them between two great Mountains, which almoſt joyned together, and covered them; and then the bright ſhining Stars became dark and were eclips'd: he thereupon awaked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely aſtoniſhed, and entered into the Temple of the Sun, and beſet himſelf to bathe his cheeks and to weep. Next morning he ordered all the Princes of the Prieſts and Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of all the Provinces of <hi>Egypt</hi> to meet together, which they did, to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62433:44"/>
number of a hundred and thirty Prieſts and Southſayers, with whom he went aſide and related to them his Dream, which they found very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and of very great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the interpetation they gave of it was that ſome great acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent would happen in the World. Among others the Prieſt <hi>Aclimon</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aclimon.</note> who was the greateſt of all, and reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed always in the Kings Court, ſaid thus to him: <q>Sir, your Dream is admirable, and I my ſelf ſaw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about a Year ſince, which frightned me very much, and which I have not revealed to any one. Tell me what it was, ſaid the King. I dreamt, ſaid the Prieſt, that I was with your Majeſty on the top of the Mountain of Fire, which is in the midſt of <hi>Emſos,</hi> and that I ſaw the Heaven ſunk down below its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Situation, ſo that it was near the Crowns of our Heads, covering and ſurrounding us, like a great Baſin turn'd upſide down; that the Stars were intermingled amongſt Men in diverſe Figures, that the people implored your Majeſties ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and ran to you in multitudes as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62433:44"/>
to their refuge; that you lifted up your hands above your head, and endeavoured to thruſt back the Heaven, and to keep it from coming down ſo low; and that I ſeeing what your Majeſty did, did alſo the ſame. While we were in that poſture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly affrighted, methought we ſaw a certain part of Heaven open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a bright light coming out of it; that afterwards the Sun roſe over us out of the ſame place, and we began to implore his aſſiſtance, whereupon he ſaid thus to us, The Heaven will return to its ordinary ſituation, when I ſhall have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed three hundred courſes. I thereupon awaked extreamly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted.</q> The Prieſt having thus ſpoken, the King commanded them to take the heights of the Stars, and to conſider what accident they por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Whereupon they declared that they promiſed firſt the Deluge, and after that Fire. Then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that Pyramids ſhould be <note place="margin">Pyramids.</note> built, that they might remove and ſecure in them what was of moſt eſteem in their Treaſuries, with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their Kings and their Wealth,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62433:45"/>
and the Aromatick Roots which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them; and that they ſhould write their wiſdom upon them, that the violence of the Water might not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it: wherein they preſently ſet themſelves at work. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> relate in their Annals, that <hi>Saurid</hi> is he who himſelf cauſed the Pyramids to be built; and that inaſmuch as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of his Father he follow'd his ſteps, cauſing the Provinces to be inhabited and cultivated, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning them well, adminiſtring Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to the People, even to his own prejudice and that of his Domeſticks, cauſing Temples to be built, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and Taliſmans to be erected, ſo that the People had a great love for him. In the <hi>Upper-Egypt</hi> he built three Cities, and did ſo many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders therein, that it is not poſſible to relate them. He firſt regulated the Tribute in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and enjoined works on Artiſts according to their power. He alſo was the firſt who ordered Penſions out of hi Treaſuries for maimed and ſick people. He cauſed to be made a <hi>Mirrour</hi> of all ſorts of Minerals, wherein they ſaw all the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sauria's</hi> Mirrour.</note> Climats, where there was abundance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62433:45"/>
of Proviſions or Sterility, and what new accident happen'd in any of the Coaſts of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This Mirrour was upon a high Turret of Braſs in the midſt of ancient <hi>Maſre,</hi> which is <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſos.</hi> He alſo firſt ordered Regiſters to be made, wherein was ſet down every day's receipts and expences, and the augmentation or diminution thereof, and kept them in the Royal Treaſuries; then when a Moneth was paſs'd he cauſed all to be reduced into one total ſum, which he alſo had kept in the Royal Treaſuries, ſealed with the Royal Seal; cauſing moreover to be graved on Stone what was to be graved thereon. He made very liberal gratifications to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Arts, and thoſe who deſerved ſomething ſhould be given them. He alſo ſet up in the midſt of the City the Figure of a Woman ſitting, made of green ſtone, with a little Child in her lap ſucking. All women who were <note place="margin">The Nurſe Idol.</note> troubled with any diſeaſe came to that Idol, and ſet their hands on the breaſts of it, and preſently they were cur'd of their indiſpoſition. When a Woman was in very hard labour, as ſoon as ſhe ſet her hand on the little
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62433:46"/>
Childs head, ſhe was immediately brought to bed with eaſe. If an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſte Woman ſet her hand on the ſame Childs head, all her members ſhook ſo that ſhe was not able to ſpeak. He made alſo ſeveral other works, which were deſtroyed by the Deluge. Yet the <hi>Coptites</hi> affirm, that they were found again after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, and uſed and adored as Idols, that their Figures are repreſented in all the Pyramids of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their diverſe names; that thoſe who taught them were Diſciples of the Prieſt <hi>Aclimon,</hi> who alſo ſhewed them all the other works in <hi>Egypt.</hi> We ſhall ſpeak of them in their proper place with the aſſiſtance of Almighty God. <hi>Saurid</hi> did alſo other prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things in his time, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">The Idol <hi>Becres.</hi>
               </note> he made an Idol named <hi>Becres,</hi> conſiſting of a mixture of divers Medicinal drugs, which had a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous vertue in ſecuring Mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from all ſorts of diſeaſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences. By means hereof they knew who ſhould eſcape and who ſhould die of their ſickneſs, by certain ſigns which appeared in the Idol; ſo that they gave over uſing remedies
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62433:46"/>
to ſome, and endeavoured the curing of others. They waſhed the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Idol, and gave the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thereof to the ſick to drink, who were thereupon immediately eaſed of their pain. 'Twas he alſo built the two great Pyramids ſo famous in all Nations. For a great part of the <note place="margin">The two great Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids.</note> Sages affirm they were built by <hi>Sedad</hi> the Son of <hi>Gad,</hi> and that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in one of the two; but the Ancients of the <hi>Coptites</hi> and their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges deny the <hi>Gadites</hi> ever entred into the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> They deny alſo the ſame thing of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and ſay that <hi>Egypt</hi> was always inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, by reaſon of its Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and their Artifices and Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems. The Learned relate in the Lives and Hiſtories, that the Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids <note place="margin">Pyramids built be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Deluge. <hi>Armelius. Abum.</hi>
               </note> were built three hundred years before the Deluge. So ſpeaks of them <hi>Armelius,</hi> Author of the Book of <hi>Illuſtrious Men. Abumaſar</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer, in his Book of <hi>Thouſans,</hi> ſays that the reaſon of building the Pyramids was the Dream which <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid</hi> the Son of <hi>Sahaloc</hi> ſaw. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it in his Book of <hi>Miraculous Dreams,</hi> where he adds that he ſent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62433:47"/>
for the Prieſts and Southſayers of his time, and the Aſtrologers, and related to them what he had ſeen of the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Moon upon Earth in the form of a Woman; of the overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Earth with its Inhabitants, and of the total Eclipſe of the Sun; and the dream he had after that: and that the Prieſts declared to him the coming of the Deluge, whereof mention is made in the Book of the <hi>Annals,</hi> which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> attribute <note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of two Brothers, <hi>Coptites.</hi>
               </note> to two Brothers <hi>Coptites,</hi> ſaying that thoſe two Brothers interpreted an ancient Book, which had been found in ſome one of their Sepulchres on the breaſt of a man. They ſay theſe two Brothers were the Children of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain man of the Race of the ancient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> to wit, thoſe who eſcaped the Deluge, and were embarqued with the Prophet of God <hi>Noah.</hi> We ſhall with the help of God ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hereafter of the Hiſtory of theſe two Brothers. It was found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Book they Tranſlated, that <hi>Saurid</hi> the Son of <hi>Sahaloc,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> after he had ſeen his dreams and related them to the Prieſts, and that <hi>Aclimon</hi> had alſo related his to him,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62433:47"/>
commanded the Prieſts to ſee what remarkable events the influences of the Stars portended to the World; and that the Prieſts having exactly erected a Celeſtial Figure for the hour of his queſtion, found that it ſignified a great miſchief which was to deſcend from Heaven, and iſſue out of the Earth, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto him; whereupon he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Pyramids and great Structures to be built, to ſerve for refuges to him and his Domeſticks, and Sepulchres for the conſervation of their Bodies; as alſo that they might engrave and mark on their Roofs, their Walls, and their Pillars, all the obſcure and difficult Sciences, whereof the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> made profeſſion, learning them and treaſuring them up as Illuſtrious Inheritances from thoſe who were grown famous in all Nations: and that they ſhould alſo repreſent on them the Figures of the Stars in their Signs, with their effects and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the ſecrets of Nature, and the productions of Arts, and the great Laws, and the beneficial Drugs, and the Taliſmans, and Medicine, and Geometry, and all the other things
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62433:48"/>
that might be advantageous to men, as well for the publick as for private perſons, clearly and intelligibly to thoſe who were acquainted with their Books, their Language, and their Writings. King <hi>Saurid</hi> knew cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that the calamity was to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to all Countries in the World, or come very near it. Then he ſaid to them, <q>When ſhall this great evil happen wherewith we are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Whereto they replyed thus: When the heart of the <hi>Lion</hi> ſhall come to the firſt Minute of <hi>Cancer</hi>'s head, and the Plantes ſhall be in their Houſes, in thoſe places of the Sphere, the Sun and Moon in the firſt minute of <hi>Aries; Pharouis,</hi> who is <hi>Saturn,</hi> in the firſt degree; <hi>Raouis,</hi> which is <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Piſces</hi> at 27 degrees 3 minutes; <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Leo</hi> at 5 degrees and ſome minutes. Then he ſaid to them, See whether after this great evil there will happen any other accident in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </q> They conſider'd and ſaw that the Stars portended an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other great misfortune, which was to deſcend from Heaven, contrary to the former, that is, a Fire that ſhould
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62433:48"/>
conſume the Univerſe. Whereupon he ſaid to them; <q>When is that to happen? They reply'd, we have made our Obſervation, and found that it is to happe, when the heart of the <hi>Lion</hi> ſhall be at the end of the fifteenth degree of <hi>Leo,</hi> and that the Sun ſhall be with him in one minute joyning that of <hi>Saturn; Jupiter</hi> is direct in the <hi>Lion,</hi> and with him <hi>Mars,</hi> changing the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute; and the Moon in <hi>Aquarius</hi> near the <hi>Dragons</hi> Tail, at twelve parts. There will be at that time an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe of the greateſt congruence, <hi>Venus</hi> ſhall be at the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Sun, and <hi>Mercury</hi> the like. Then <hi>Saurid</hi> ſaid unto them, Is there yet any other great accident that you can fore-ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe two remarkable evils?</q> They look'd and found that when the heart of the <hi>Lion</hi> ſhall have compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two thirds of his circle, there would not remain any Animal mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Earth, which ſhould not be deſtroy'd; and that when he ſhould compleat his revolution, the knots of the Sphere would be diſſolved. The King was very much aſtoniſhed at
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62433:49"/>
that, and commanded the great Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to be cut down, and that the great Pavement ſhould be melted: he cauſed Tin to be brought out of the Weſtern parts, then he made them take black ſtones, which he cauſed to be laid for the foundations of the Pyramids about <hi>Syene.</hi> They were brought from the <hi>Nile</hi> upon Engines, and they had certain particular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and marks, and upon them painted Billets, which the Sages had ſet there: ſo that when they had ſmitten the ſtone, it advanc'd of it ſelf the ſpace of a Flight-ſhot. Theſe ſtones were ſet in the foundations of the Pyramids, to wit, of the firſt, <note place="margin">The three Pyramids.</note> which is the Eaſtern, and of the Weſtern, and of the Coloured. They put in the midſt of every piece an Iron Bar like a Pivot ſtanding up, then they ſet on that another piece after they had made a hole through the middle of it, that the Iron Pivot might enter into it, and faſten it to that which was under; after which they melted Lead, and it was poured all about the piece, after they had adjuſted the Writing which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. He cauſed Gates to be made
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62433:49"/>
under ground, at four Cubits depth, according to their meaſure; which Gates had Sallies into vaulted Caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates built of ſtone, and fortify'd with much Artifice, and whereof the Situation was conceal'd, every Vault being fifty Cubits in length. The Gate of the Eaſtern Pyramid was on the South-ſide a hundred Cubits di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the midſt of the Weſtern wall on the Weſtern ſide. They meaſur d alſo from the Weſtern wall, that is, from the midſt of it a hundred Cubits, and they digg'd till they got down to the door of the vaulted Caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, through which they entred into it. As to the Colour'd Pyramid, <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid.</note> made of ſtones of two colours, the Gate of it was on the Maritime or North-ſide, and they meaſur'd alſo from the midſt of the Maritime wall a hundred Cubits, which made five hundred, according to the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> meaſure. He built it perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the ground, to the depth of forty Cubits, then he raiſed it as much, though what is above ground of the Pyramids do not exceed the third part, ſo that this laſt is the higheſt, built after the manner of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62433:50"/>
raiſed Floors and high Rooms of our preſent time. They built them in the time of their good fortune, while all their Worldly concerns came accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their wiſhes. King <hi>Saurid</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compleated the Structure, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd them with Silks of ſeveral co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours from the top to the bottom, and cauſed a great Feaſt to be celebrated for them, whereto all the Inhabitants of the Kingdom came, not ſo much as one being wanting from all the Coaſts of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to make thirty <hi>Gernes</hi> or great Veſſels of colour'd ſtone, which they excellently caſt. He alſo ordered covers to be made of the ſame. Every Veſſel held a hundred Mules load. He cauſed them to be ſet in the loweſt Story of the Eaſtern Pyramid, and had brought thither precious Stones and Jacinths, till the Floor was full thereof. He cauſed the Veſſels to be cover'd with their Covers, and Lead to be melted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then he cauſed pieces of Gold and Silver to be ſcatter'd, as much as might divert their ſight who ſhould look on them. Then he cauſed to be brought thither all he could of his Treaſures,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62433:50"/>
and the moſt precious of his Wealth, Jewels, Plate, Precious Stones, caſt and coloured Pearls, Veſſels of Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, Veſſels of Gold and Silver, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues excellently wrought, Artificial Waters, Taliſmans, precious Iron that would twine about like Cloath, Philoſophical Laws, the Nurſes of Wiſdom, divers ſorts of Medicinal Drugs, exquiſite Tables of Braſs, on which divers Sciences were written; as alſo Poiſons and Mortal drinks, which Kings have ready by them, and wholeſome Preſervatives and Antidotes; and ſeveral other things, which it is impoſſible to deſcribe. But all this could not ſecure them from the evils wherewith God afflicted them for their Infidelity. In the mean time they imagin'd that their Fortreſſes would defend them againſt God; but God came to them on the ſide they were not aware of, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed their great Flocks by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge and other misfortunes: Praiſe be to him, he is the only and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. All is periſhable ſave onely his Majeſty; to him belongs Wiſdom, and to him you will return. After that, ſays the Author, King
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62433:51"/>
               <hi>Saurid</hi> cauſed to be brought into the ſecond Pyramid the Idols of the Stars, and the Tabernacles of the Celeſtial Bodies, and what Statues and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes his Anceſtors had cauſed to be made, by means whereof men had acceſs to him, and their Books, and what Annals and Hiſtories they had cauſed to be made for themſelves of what had paſs'd in their time, and of the predictions of what was to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen after them, to the Kings who ſhould govern <hi>Egypt</hi> to the laſt times, and the ſtate of the fixed Stars, and what was to happen by their repoſe and motions from time to time. Then he cauſed to be put into the third Pyramid the Bodies of the Kings and Prieſts in <hi>Gernes,</hi> or great Veſſels of hard black Stone; and by every Prieſt his Book, and the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of his Art and Life. He alſo cauſed to be ſet along the walls of the Pyramids Idols, which held in their hands all the Arts according to their ranks and meaſures, the deſcription of each Art, and the manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing it, and what was neceſſary for that, and in like manner the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> For the Prieſts were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62433:51"/>
into ſeven Orders; the firſt <note place="margin">Seven Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Prieſts.</note> whereof was that of the <hi>Caters,</hi> who were they that ſerved all the ſeven Planets, every Planet ſeven Years. With the <hi>Cater</hi> was the Univerſal Doctor. The ſecond Order was theirs who ſerv'd ſix Planets, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed after the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. After that they named that which ſerved five of them, and under, the following and inferiour. Then he cauſed alſo to be brought into the third Pyramid the Bodies of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Laws, with thoſe of the Prieſts, and the wealth of the Houſes of the Stars and their Ornaments, which they had had by Offerings, and the goods of the Prieſts. After that he appointed one of them for a Guard to each Pyramid. The Guard <note place="margin">Guards of the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids.</note> therefore of the Eaſtern Pyramid was an Idol of <hi>Jamanick</hi> ſhell, black and white, which had both eyes open, and ſate on a Throne, having near it as it were a Halberd, on which if any one caſt his eye, he heard on that ſide a dreadful noiſe, which made his heart faint, and he who heard that noiſe dyed. There was a Spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſerve that Guard, which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62433:52"/>
Spirit never went from before it. The Guard of the Weſtern Pyramid was an Idol of hard Red ſtone, having in like manner in his hand ſomewhat like a Halberd, and on his head a wreathed Serpent, which flew at thoſe who came near him, clung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their necks and kill'd them. There was appointed to ſerve him an ugly deformed Spirit, which parted not from him. For Guard to the third Pyramid he had plac'd a ſmall Idol of <hi>Baby</hi> ſtone, on a Baſis of the ſame; which Idol drew to it thoſe who look'd on it, and ſtuck to them till it had deſtroy'd them, or made them diſtracted. There was alſo a Spirit appointed to ſerve it, which parted not from it. <hi>Saurid</hi> having finiſh'd the building of the Pyramids, and compaſſed them with the bodies of Spiritual ſubſtances, he offer'd Sacrifices to them, and preſented them with the Offerings choſen for them. The Spirits appointed for the ſervice of each Star knew the Aſcendant of the Stars they ſerved, and they ſerv'd them according to their rank one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another. He diſtributed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the names under which ſhould
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62433:52"/>
be divided the Works that ſhould be preſented to them. The <hi>Coptites</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that King <hi>Saurid</hi>'s Name was written upon the firſt Pyramid, with the time ſpent in the building of it. Some ſay he had it built in ſix mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and that he defied thoſe that came after him to demoliſh it in 600 years; though it be certain it is more eaſie to pull down then to build. He ſaid alſo ſpeaking to them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <q>I have cover'd them with Silk, do you cover them if you can with Linen cloth.</q> But thoſe who have reigned after him at ſeveral times, have ſeen that they were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of him, and that they could not cover them ſo much as with Mat, and with much ado ſhould they have cover'd them with any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>As to the miraculous ſtories related <note place="margin">Stories of the Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids.</note> of the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> the Author of that Book (God ſhew him mercy) ſays, that in the Annals contained in the Books of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, there is ſuch plenty of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hiſtories, that it is impoſſible to relate them all: I ſhall onely (adds he) relate ſome of them, and among
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62433:53"/>
others this; The Commander of the Faithful, the <hi>Mamunus,</hi> God ſhew him mercy, being come into the Land <note place="margin">Story I.</note> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and having ſeen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids, had a deſire to demoliſh them, or at leaſt ſome one of them, to ſe what was within it. Whereupon it was thus ſaid to him; <q>You deſire a thing which it is not poſſible for you to have. If you attempt it and fail, it will be a diſhonour to the Commander of the Faithful</q> Whereto he replied, <q>I cannot for bear but I muſt diſcover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</q> He therefore put them to work at the breach, which was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy begun, and made great expences therein. For they kindled fire on the ſtone, then they caſt Vinegar on it, and afterwards batter'd the place with Engines. The breadth of the wall was 20 Cubits, according to the Geometrical meaſure. Being come to the upper ſtory of the Pyramid, they found behind the breach a green Baſin, wherein there were pieces of Gold weighing each of them an ounce, according to our ordinary Weights; and of thoſe pieces there was juſt 1000. The Demoliſhers
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62433:53"/>
wonder'd at it, and brought the Gold to the <hi>Mamunus,</hi> not knowing what it meant. The <hi>Mamunus</hi> was alſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at it, admiring the excellent Workmanſhip and good Alloy of the Gold. Then he ſaid to them, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute what expence you have made in the breach. They computed, and found that the expence equall'd the value of the Gold which they had found, ſo as that there was not a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more or leſs. The <hi>Mamunus</hi> was yet more aſtoniſh'd at that, and ſaid to thoſe who kept his Accompts; <q>Conſider the foreſight of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the greatneſs of their Science. Their Sages had told them that there would ariſe ſome one that ſhould in ſome place open one of theſe Pyramids: they exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that, and computed what expence he ſhould make who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted that work, and ſet the ſumme at the place; that he who got thither, finding his account, and ſeeing he had not gain'd any thing, ſhould not begin any ſuch work again.</q> They ſay the Baſin was made of a green Emerald, and that the <hi>Mamunus</hi> had it carried to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62433:54"/>
               <hi>Gueraca,</hi> where it was one of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt pieces of his Treaſury.</p>
            <p>Another Hiſtory relates, that after <note place="margin">Story II.</note> the Pyramid was open'd people went in out of curioſity for ſome years, many entering into it, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning thence without any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, others periſhing in it. One day it happened that a company of Young men (above 20 in number) ſwore that they would go into it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided nothing hindered them, and to force their way to the end of it. They therefore took along with them meat and drink for two moneths: they alſo took Plates of Iron and Bars, Wax-candles and Lanterns, Match and Oyl, Hatchets, Hooks, and other ſharp Inſtruments, and enter'd into the Pyramid: moſt of them got down from the firſt Deſcent and the ſecond, and paſs'd along the ground of the Pyramid, where they ſaw Bats as big as black Eagles, which began to beat their Faces with much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But they generouſly endur'd that inconvenience, and advanc'd ſtill till they came to a Narrow paſſage, through which came an impetuous wind, and extra ordinary cold; yet ſo
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62433:54"/>
as they could not perceive whence it came, nor whither it went. They advanc'd to get into the Narrow place, and then their Candles began to go out, which obliged them to put them into their Lanterns. Then they entered, but the place ſeemed to be joyn'd and cloſe before them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one of them ſaid to the reſt, <q>Tie me by the waſt with a cord, and I will venture to advance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally that if any accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to me, you immediately draw me back.</q> At the entrance of the Narrow place there were great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty veſſels made like Coffins, with their lids by them; whence they inferr'd, that thoſe who ſet them there had prepar'd them for their death; and that to get to their Treaſures and Wealth there was a neceſſity of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through that Narrow place. They bound their Companion with cords, that he might venture to get through that paſſage; but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the paſsage clos'd upon him, and they heard the noiſe of the cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his bones: they drew the cords to them, but they could not get him back. Then there came to them a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62433:55"/>
dreadful voice out of that Cave, which ſtartled and blinded them ſo that they fell down, having neither motion nor ſenſe. They came to themſelves awhile after, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to get out, being much at a loſs what to do. At laſt after much trouble they returned, ſave onely ſome of them who fell under the Deſcent. Being come out into the Plain they ſate down together, all aſtoniſhed at what they had ſeen, and reflecting on what had happened to them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Earth cleft before them, and caſt up their dead Companion, who was at firſt immovable, but two hours after began to move, and ſpoke to them in a Language they underſtood not, for it was not the <hi>Arabian.</hi> But ſome time after one of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Upper <hi>Egypt</hi> interpreted it to them, and told them his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was this; <hi>This is the reward of thoſe who endeavour to ſeiſe what belongs to another.</hi> After theſe words their Companion ſeemed dead as before, whereupon they buried him in that place. Some of them died alſo in the Pyramid. Since that, he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in thoſe parts, having heard
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62433:55"/>
of their adventure, they were brought to him, and they related all this to him, which he much wondered at.</p>
            <p>Another Hiſtory relates, that ſome entered into the Pyramid, and came <note place="margin">Story III.</note> to the loweſt part of it, where they turned round about. There appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them a Hollow place, wherein there was a beaten path, in which they began to go. And then they found a Baſin, out of which diſtill'd freſh water, which fell into ſeveral Pits which were under the Baſin, ſo as they knew not whence it came, nor whether it went. After that they found a ſquare Hall, the walls where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were of ſtrange ſtones of ſeveral colours. One of the company took a little ſtone and put into his mouth, and immediately his ears were deafen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Afterwards they came to a place made like a Ciſtern full of coined Gold, like a large ſort of Cakes that are made; for every piece was of the weight of 1000 Drams. They took ſome of them, but could not get out of the place till they had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them into the place whence they had taken them. They afterwards found another place with a great
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62433:56"/>
Bench, ſuch as is ordinarily before houſes for people to ſit on; and on the Bench a Figure of green ſtone, repreſenting a tall ancient Man ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, having a large Garment about him, and little Statues before him, as if they were Children whom he taught: they took ſome of thoſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, but could not get out of the place till they had left them behind them. They paſſed on along the ſame way, and heard a dreadful noiſe and great hurly-burly, which they durſt not approach. Then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advanced further, they found a ſquare place, as if it were for ſome great Aſſembly, where there were many Statues, and among others the Figure of a Cock made of red Gold: that Figure was dreadful, enamelled with Jacinths, whereof there were two great ones in both eyes, which ſhined like two great Torches: they went near it, and immediately it crew terribly, and began to beat its two wings, and thereupon they heard ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral voices which came to them on all ſides. They kept on their way, and found afterwards an Idol of white ſtone, with the Figure of a Woman
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62433:56"/>
ſtanding on her head, and two Lions of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te ſtone lying on each ſide of her, which ſeem'd to roar and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bite. They recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to God and went on, and kept on their way till they ſaw a Light; after which going out at an open place, they perceiv'd they were in a great Sandy Deſert. At the paſſage out of that open place there were two Statues of black ſtone, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Half Pikes in their hands. They were extremely aſtoniſh'd, whereupon they began to return towards the Eaſt, till they came near the Pyramids on the out ſide. This happen'd in the time of <hi>Jezid,</hi> the Son of <hi>Gabdolme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,</hi> the Son of <hi>Gabdol,</hi> Governour of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who having heard of it ſent ſome perſons with thoſe before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of to obſerve the open place of the Pyramid. They ſought it ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days, but could never find it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whereupon they were account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fools. But they ſhew'd him the head of a Ring which one of them had taken in the Aſſembly-place, which they had found in the Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid; which obliged him to believe what they ſaid. That head was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62433:57"/>
at a great ſumme of money.</p>
            <p>It is further related, that other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <note place="margin">Story IV.</note> in the time of the Commander <hi>Achemed,</hi> the Son of <hi>Toulon</hi> (God ſhew him mercy) entered in like manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pyramid, and found there a Cruſe of red Glaſs, which they brought away. As they came out they loſt one of their Men, which oblig'd them to go in again to look for him. They found him ſtark naked laughing continually, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, Trouble not your ſelves to look for me. After which he got away from them, and return'd into the Pyramid. Whence they inferr'd that the Spirits had diſtracted him, whereupon they went out and left him there. Upon which they were accuſed before the Judge, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd them to exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and took away from them the Cruſe, which had in it four pound of glaſs. A certain perſon ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that that Cruſe had not been ſet in that place for nothing. Which occaſioned the filling of it with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then being weighed again, it weighed as much as when it was emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and no more. They afterwards
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62433:57"/>
took off ſome of that water ſeveral times, but the Veſſel came ſtill to the ſame weight. Whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that it was one of the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels whereof the Ancients had made uſe, and had been made to that purpoſe by their Sages, and placed there. For the uſe of Wine was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted among them. This was a ſtrange Miracle.</p>
            <p>They relate further ſeveral Stories <note place="margin">Story V.</note> of this kind, and among others that ſome entered into the Pyramid with a Child to abuſe it; and that having committed that ſin, there came out againſt them a black young Man, with a Cudgel in his hand, who beat them furiouſly, ſo that they fled leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there their Meat and their Cloaths. The ſame thing happen'd to others in the Pyramid of <hi>Achemima.</hi> There entered alſo into the Pyramid of <hi>Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mima</hi> a Man and a Woman to commit Adultery therein; but they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately caſt along on the ground, and dyed in a Phrenſie.</p>
            <p>When the Prieſts (ſays the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) <note place="margin">Predictions made to King <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid.</hi>
               </note> had told King <hi>Saurid</hi> of the great conflagration, which was to happen by Fire, and that that Fire
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62433:58"/>
ſhould come out of the Sign <hi>Leo;</hi> he cauſed to be made in the Pyramids certain windings, which abutted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on narrow Vaults, which drew the Winds into the Pyramids with a dreadful noiſe. He alſo cauſed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels to be made therein, by which the Water of the <hi>Nile</hi> came in at the ſame place, then it retreated of it ſelf, and return'd into the <hi>Nile</hi> by another paſſage, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Ciſterns which are made for the reception of Rain-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He alſo cauſed certain Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels to be made therein, which reach'd to certain places of the Land of the Weſt, and to certain places of the Land of <hi>Upper Egypt.</hi> He fill'd thoſe Subterraneous places with prodigious things, Statues, ſpeaking Idols, and Taliſmans. Some <hi>Coptites</hi> affirm, that after the coming of the Deluge, and the Conflagration had been predicted to him, he ſaid to the Aſtrologers; <q>Shall our Countrey ſuffer ſome part of theſe misfortunes? It ſhall (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd they) be afflicted with a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which ſhall continue ſo many years, that the Dragons and Vipers ſhall be ſo exceedingly multiplied
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62433:58"/>

And whence ſhall this deſolation come? ſaid <hi>Saurid.</hi> From the King of a remote Countrey, ſaid they, who ſhall deſtroy its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and ſo ruine it, that the marks thereof ſhall remain eternally, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carrying away all its Wealth. But after that it ſhall be repeopled by his Son, born of one of his Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women.</q> This King was <hi>Nahucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donozor,</hi> who deſtroy'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <note place="margin">Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nozor.</note> whoſe Son <hi>Balſas</hi> (born of a Captive <hi>Copteſs)</hi> repeopled it, and built there the Caſtle and the Church <hi>Mugalleca,</hi> or <hi>Suſpended.</hi> 
               <q>What ſhall happen after that? ſaid <hi>Saurid</hi> to the Prieſts.

After that, ſaid he again, what ſhall happen? Its <hi>Nile</hi> ſhall fail it, reply'd they, and its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants ſhall forſake it.

from the Eaſtern Coaſt; afterwards by another coming from the Weſtern Coaſt, which ſhall be the laſt.</q> He commanded all this to be writ down, and that it ſhould be graved on the Pyramids and Obelisks. One of the things which confirm this diſcourſe by their conſonancy is, that <hi>Abucabil,</hi> the <hi>Mogapherian,</hi> the Pacifier, related this to <hi>Achamed,</hi> the Son of <hi>Toulon,</hi> (God ſhew him mercy) when he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Egypt.</hi> With the help of God we ſhall ſpeak of him hereafter.</p>

when ſhe would provoke any one to love and make him diſtracted, ſhe laughs on him, and preſently he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches her, and ſhe draws him to her, and beſots him with love, ſo that he immediately grows mad, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders like a Vagabond up and down the Countrey.

The Spirit of the <hi>Birba</hi> of <hi>Buſira</hi> appears in the form of an old white Monk carrying a Book.

The Spirit of the <hi>Birba</hi> of <hi>Samnos</hi> appears in the form of a Monk, who comes out of the Sea, and views himſelf in it as in a Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs.

They ſay no man got

out of the bowels of the Earth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Precious ſtones, Pearls, and other Minerals, as this King did. He was very ſevere to the Prophet of God <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and endeavoured much to do him harm; but God prevented him, and preſerved the Prophet. <hi>Darmaſel</hi> had lived 300 years when God ſent <hi>Noah,</hi> who was then 150 years of age. He lived in his Nation according to what God had revealed to him 1000 years wanting 50; then he lived after the Deluge 200 years. He was the firſt Prophet that came after <hi>Edriſus,</hi> to whom God grant peace. His Law was to profeſs the Unity of God, to pray, to pay the Sacred Tribute, to obſerve Abſtinence, and to fight in the way of God againſt the Children of <hi>Cabel.</hi> After that he called his Nation to God, and made them fear his chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But they began preſently to ill-treat him. Yet was it long ere they diſcovered his enterpriſe to King <hi>Darmaſel,</hi> during which <hi>Noah</hi> was continually in the houſes of their Idols and in their Temples. And when he ſaid unto them, <q>My Friends, ſay there is no other God then the true God, and that I am his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62433:65"/>
Servant and Apoſtle.</q> h Tey put their fingers into their Ears, and their Heads into their Mantles, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing was the diſcourſe to them. Then when he came to ſay, there is no other God then the true God, the Idols fell down with their faces to the ground; and then the People fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and beat him till he fell down. After that King <hi>Darmaſel</hi> heard of his carriage, and ordered him to be brought into his preſence, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by his own people, who held a Ponyard to his Throat, and to whom the King ſpoke thus: <q>Is this he who you ſay ſpeaks reproachfully of the Gods, and would deſtroy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</q> Yea, replyed they. Then he ſaid to <hi>Noah;</hi> 
               <q>O <hi>Noah,</hi> what do they here tell me of thee, that thou oppoſeſt my Religion, and what thy Fathers Children believe? what Magick is this whereby thou haſt made the Idols tumble out of their places? who taught thee this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? Great King, replyed <hi>Noah,</hi> were they Gods as you imagine, my diſcourſes could not hurt them, and they would not have fallen out of their places. For my part, I am
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62433:65"/>
the Servant of God and his Apoſtle. Honour the true God, and imagine nothing equal to him, for he ſees you.</q> Thereupon <hi>Darmaſel</hi> put <hi>Noah</hi> into Priſon till the Feaſt of the Idols came, to the end he ſhould offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to them. He alſo cauſed the Idols to be returned into their places on their Thrones, and made Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them. Then when the time of the Idol-Feaſt drew near, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Herald to aſſemble all the the Peóple, that they might ſee what he did to <hi>Noah.</hi> Then <hi>Noah</hi> implored the aſſiſtance of God againſt him, and he was immediately troubled with a great Head-ach and a Phrenſie, which continu'd a week, after which he died. He was put into a golden Coffin, wherewith a Proceſſion was made in the Temple of the Idols, his Subjects weeping about him, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and railing at <hi>Noah.</hi> Then they carried him (I mean the King) into the Pyramids, and diſpoſed him into a Tomb which had been prepared for him. He had appointed his Son to <note place="margin">Mechavel <hi>Son of</hi> Darmaſel.</note> be King after him. He brought <hi>Noah</hi> out of Priſon, eſteeming him a diſtracted perſon, and forbid under
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62433:66"/>
great penalties, his relapſing into the faults wherewith he was charged. <hi>Noah,</hi> Gods mercy to him, expected till the day of one of their great Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, on which they aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſerve their Idols. He then came to them and ſaid thus, <q>Say there is no other God then the true God, and that I am his Servant and Apoſtle.</q> With thoſe words the Idols fell down of all ſides, and the people fell upon <hi>Noah,</hi> cruelly beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, making ſeveral wounds in his head, and dragging him along the ground with his Face downwards. Then the Heavens and the Earth, the Mountains and the Seas cryed vengeance to God, ſaying, <q>O Lord, do you not ſee the cruel treatment made to your Prophet <hi>Noah?</hi>
               </q> The Almighty and All-good God made them ſenſible that that cruelty was exerciſed on himſelf, that he would puniſh thoſe Rebels, and do right to <hi>Noah.</hi> They afterwards carried <hi>Noah</hi> before the King, who ſpoke thus to him, <q>Have not I already par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned thee, and opened my Fathers Priſons, conditionally thou ſhouldſt not return to thy faults? I am (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.

                  <hi>Noah)</hi> a Servant, who does what he is commanded. Who hath given thee that command? ſaid the King. My God, replyed <hi>Noah.</hi> Who is that God? ſaid the King. The Lord of the Heavens and the Earth, ſaid <hi>Noah,</hi> the Lord of all Creatures. And what hath he commanded thee? ſaid the King. He hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me (replyed <hi>Noah)</hi> to call you to his ſervice, and he commands you and your Subjects to forſake the Worſhip of Idols, and to follow the ordinances of Prayer, payment of the Sacred Tribute, and the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Faſting. And if we do it not, ſaid the King, what will be the iſſue? If he pleaſe (replied <hi>Noah)</hi> he will immediately deſtroy you; and if he pleaſe he will give you time to reflect on your ways till a certain term. Let thy God alone (ſaid the King) and what he deſires of us, and do thou thy ſelf give over importuning us. How can I give over (replied <hi>Noah)</hi> when I am a Servant who does what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, and cannot diſobey his All-good and Almighty Maſter?</q> Then the King (ſays the Author)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62433:67"/>
cauſed <hi>Noah</hi> to be impriſoned, to make an oblation of him to the Idols, as his Father had done before. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, <hi>Saudib</hi> who was a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lord and a Prieſt, rebelled againſt <note place="margin">Saudib.</note> the King, and attempted to deprive him of his Crown. The Wars which the King was engaged in againſt him diverted him from thinking on the buſineſs of the Prophet of God <hi>Noah,</hi> and obliged him to put him out of Priſon, till he had the leiſure to have him brought before him. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards agreed with <hi>Saudib,</hi> by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a portion of the upper part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and return'd to his Royal Palace. The Devil (Gods curſe on him) ſoon began to ſollicit him to put the Prophet of God <hi>Noah</hi> to death, but Almighty God diverted him, ſo that the affaires of <hi>Noah</hi> were in different poſtures. The Son of <hi>Darmaſel</hi> ſent thereupon to all the Kings of the Earth, deſiring them to ſend him all the Prieſts and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that they might diſpute againſt <hi>Noah.</hi> They came to him from all parts, and diſputed againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; but he baffled them all.

               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:62433:67"/>
Prieſt <hi>Philemon,</hi> of whom we have <note place="margin">Philemon.</note> already ſpoken, God ſhew him mercy. He diſputed againſt him, and <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> acknowledged the Unity of God, who directed him ſo that he became faithful, and embarqued with <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ship. After that God revealed his will to <hi>Noah</hi> in theſe terms: <q>
                  <hi>Make the Ark,</hi> and the reſt of the Verſe. <note place="margin">The Ark.</note> How ſhall I make it?</q> ſaid <hi>Noah.</hi> Then <hi>Gabriel</hi> came to him, and ſhew'd him the Model of it, ordering him to give him the Figure of a <hi>Gondola</hi> of glaſs. He was ten years a building of it, and he made it of the <hi>Indian Plane</hi> Tree, a hundred Cubits in length, according to the meaſure of his time, and fifty Cubits in height, and divided it into three Stories. The people of his Countrey in the mean time paſs'd by him, and laughed and ſcoffed at what he did. Some brought to him their little Children, and charged them to beware of him. And ſometimes the Children ſeeing him, endeavoured to hurt and diſturb him. When <hi>Noah</hi> had compleated the Ship, he made the entrance on the ſide, and it continued lying on the ground ſeven Moneths, till they had offered up to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62433:68"/>
their Idols three companies of thoſe who had believed <hi>Noah.</hi> Then was the Decree of their chaſtiſement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and God commanded <hi>Noah</hi> to put into the Ship two pairs of every ſpecies. <q>Whence ſhall I be able to get all that?</q> ſaid <hi>Noah.</hi> Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately God commanded the four Winds to bring together about him all he had ordered to be put into the Ark; which they did. He took in at the firſt door the Wild and Tame Beaſts, the Reptiles and the Birds; at the ſecond (which was that of the middle) he took in Meat and Drink, and the Body of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was in a Shrine. Then he entered himſelf at the higheſt door with his children, and thoſe who had believed in him. Relations agree not about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Faithful who entered into the Ark; moſt affirm they were forty Men, and forty Women. When <hi>Noah</hi> and his Companions were got into the Ship, the news of it came to the King, who began to laugh at it, ſaying, Where is the water on which that Veſſel is to Sail? They knew well enough that the Deluge was to come, but had no notice of the time
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62433:68"/>
of its coming, that the will of God might be fulfilled upon them. Upon that <hi>Mechavel</hi> the Son of <hi>Darmaſel</hi> got on Horſeback, with a party of his People, and went firſt to the Temple of his Idols, where he ſtayed a while, then went towards the place where the Ship was, with an intention to fire it. Being come near it he call'd <hi>Noah</hi> with a loud voice, and <hi>Noah</hi> having anſwered him, <q>Where (ſaid he) is the water which is to bear thee in this Ship? It will be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately with you replied <hi>Noah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you go out of this place. Come down (O <hi>Noah)</hi> ſaid the King, and alſo thoſe who are with thee. O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Man! ſaid <hi>Noah,</hi> turn to God, for behold his Chaſtiſements are ready to fall upon you.</q> Theſe words incenſed the King, ſo that he commanded fire to be caſt into the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mechavel</hi> would fire the Ark.</note> Ship, upon him and upon his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. But immediately there comes a Meſſenger in great haſte, telling him for news that a Woman heating the Oven to bake her Bread, water ruſh'd <note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</note> out of it as out of a great Torrent. <q>Unfortunate Man! replied the King; how could water come out of a hot
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62433:69"/>
Oven? Unfortunate King! replied <hi>Noah;</hi> 'tis one of the ſigns of my Lords wrath, which is deſcending on you and yours, according to what he hath revealed to me to threaten you withall. Another ſign of the ſame thing is, that the Earth is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhake and to ſtagger, that the water is going to overflow it on all ſides, and that it is going to ſpring up under the Horſe's feet on which you are mounted, even in the place where you now are.</q> Immediately the King was obliged to put back his Horſe from the place where he was, ſeeing the water ſpringing up under his Feet by the permiſſion of God. As ſoon as he was got to another place, behold his Meſſengers returning to him, tell him that the water was very much riſen and augmented, which forc'd him to a ſudden departure, to return with all ſpeed to his Caſtle, that he might take his Servants and his Children, and diſpoſe them into the Fortreſſes which he had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the tops of the Mountains, and where he had put in proviſions as much as he imagin'd would be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. But preſently the Earth began
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62433:69"/>
to open, and the Feet of the Horſes to enter into it, ſo that they could not get them out, which obliged them to get off, and to leave them there. In like manner the doors of Heaven were opened and let fall a great Rain, as if water had been poured out of great Earthen Pots, ſo that the waters o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertook them ere they could recover the Mountains, and hindered their get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up to them. They juſtled and thruſt one another, and knew not which ſide to turn by reaſon of the violence of the Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the greatneſs of the evil which was come upon them. The Women carried their Children at their backs, then when the water was come up to their mouths they caſt them under their feet, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſave themſelves. Had God been diſpoſed to have compaſſion on the Unbelievers, he would have been merciful to the Mother and the Child. One of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons was with the King, the Son of <hi>Darmaſel,</hi> when he came to fire the Ship. His Father cried out to him, <q>O my dear Son, Embarque thy ſelf with us.

            <p>I found (ſays the Author of this <note place="margin">Hiſtory of <hi>Noah,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an ancient Book found by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> Book, <hi>Murtadi</hi> the Son of <hi>Gaphiphus,</hi> on whom God have mercy) in a Book (the greateſt part whereof was torn out) the Hiſtory of <hi>Noah,</hi> with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Additions and Augmentations, which I will fully ſet down here, to the end this Book may want no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which may raiſe its value with thoſe who ſhall read it, or hear it read, with the direction and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God. Theſe Augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then relate, that the Patriarch, the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62433:71"/>
Father of <hi>Noah,</hi> (Gods peace be with him) dreamt that he ſaw iſſuing out of his Mouth a fire, which burnt the whole Terreſtrial World. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon awaked much aſtoniſhed. Some days after he dreamt again, that he was upon a Tree in the midſt of a great Sea without Shores, which alſo aſtoniſh'd him very much. After that there being born to him a Son, the Prophet of God <hi>Noah,</hi> the good tidings of it ſpread over the whole Earth; and the Prieſt <hi>Galoumas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it immediately to <hi>Mechavel</hi> the Son of <hi>Darmaſel,</hi> aſſuring him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the Terreſtrial world ſhould periſh in his time, that is, in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> whoſe life was to be very long. The Prieſts knew alſo by their Sciences, that there would happen a Deluge, which ſhould drown the Earth and its Inhabitants; but they always hoped to ſecure themſelves from what ſhould happen with King <hi>Darmaſel.</hi> The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded that there ſhould be ſtrong Caſtles built on the tops of the Mountains, that they might retire thither and be ſafe as they imagined. They built ſeven Caſtles of that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62433:71"/>
kind, according to the number of their Idols, whereof they gave them the names, and graved thereon their Sciences. After that <hi>Noah</hi> being grown up, (God grant him peace and mercy) God ſent him to them for an Apoſtle, and there happen'd to him what God himſelf relates in his Book. <hi>Noah</hi> was of delicate complexion, his Head was ſomewhat long, his Arms very large, as alſo his Leggs, his Thighs very fleſhy, his Beard long and broad: he was large and thick. He was the firſt Prophet that came after <hi>Edriſus,</hi> and he is numbered among the famous Envoys for their conſtancy and reſolution. He liv'd 1250 years. The Philoſophers will not have him live ſo long, as differing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about long lives. His law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the profeſſion of the Unity of God, and the Sacred Combat againſt thoſe who oppoſed the eſtabliſhment of his Religion, commanding the good and forbidding the evil, ordered the following of things permitted, and the avoiding of things forbidden, and the obſervance of purity and cleanlineſs. Almighty God had commanded him to induce his Nation
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62433:72"/>
to the proefeſſion of his Unity, to mind them of the good things they had received of him, and to raiſe in them a fear of his indignation. The Hiſtory relates, that <hi>Noah</hi> was born in the Reign of <hi>Mechavel,</hi> the Son of <hi>Darmaſel,</hi> and that being two hundred years of age <hi>Mechavel</hi> died, and had for Succeſſor his ſon <hi>Darmaſel,</hi> who was much addicted to the worſhip of the Idols, exalting them as much as lay in his power, and commanding the People to ſerve them well. In the mean time <hi>Noah</hi> began to Preach the Religion of Almighty God, going through the Market-places, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, the Temples, the Inns, and calling the people to God. They kept his Preaching ſecret, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered nothing of it to King <hi>Darmaſel,</hi> till ſuch time as his enterprize having been obſerved, Men bewared of him, and the King heard of him. They ſay that <hi>Mechavel</hi> (God curſe him) impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned <hi>Noah</hi> 3 years before he died; and that after his death his ſon <hi>Darmaſel</hi> (who was his Succeſſor) brought <hi>Noah</hi> out of Priſon, and commanded him to forbear corrupting Religion, and exclaming againſt the Gods. There
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62433:72"/>
was among them for their ſeven great Idols a Feaſt which they celebrated every year, during which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to offer Sacrifices, and make Proceſſions about the Idols. The time of that Feaſt being come, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Feaſt of <hi>Jagoth,</hi> the people came together from all parts, and then <hi>Noah</hi> came to that Aſſembly, and having paſs'd through the midſt of the People, and cry'd with a loud voice; O Friends, ſay as I do; There is no other God then the great God. The people put their fingers into their Ears, and their Heads into their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but the Idols fell at <hi>Noah</hi>'s cry; which obliged the men to fall upon him, and to beat him cruelly, giving him ſeveral wounds in the head, then dragging him along the ground, with his face towards the Kings Palace, into which they made him enter, and brought him before him. <q>Have not I done thee a favour (ſaid the King) in taking thee out of Priſon, though thou haſt ſpoken againſt our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rail'd at our Gods, and forſaken the footſteps of thy Fathers and Grand-fathers? Mean time thou comeſt again to exerciſe thy Magick

againſt the Gods, ſo as thou haſt made them to fall from their thrones, torn from their ſtations, and the places of their honour and their glory. What hath forc'd thee to this extremity? If theſe Idols (replied <hi>Noah)</hi> were Gods as you imagine, they would not have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len at my voice. Fear God, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Prince; turn to him, and believe nothing equal to him; for he ſees you. Who is he (ſaid the King) who has made thee ſo confident as to ſpeak to me in theſe terms? I will ſacrifice thy Bloud to the Idols.</q> He thereupon commanded him to be kept in priſon till the day of the Feaſt of <hi>Jagoth,</hi> that he might be ſacrificed to him; and that the Idols might at the ſame time be exalted to their thrones. But he ſaw afterwards a Dream which ſtartled him, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to order <hi>Noah</hi> to be put out of priſon, giving out among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that he was diſtracted.</p>

He ſpent afterwards three Ages in preaching always to the people the Religion of Almighty God, without other effect ſave that they grew the more impious and inſolent. Nay, they kill'd ſome of thoſe who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him, and rifled their honſes; and then God revealed to him, that of his Nation there would be no other Believers ſave onely thoſe who had already embraced the Faith. <hi>Noah</hi> deſpairing of their Converſion began to pray to God againſt them, and to ſay, <hi>O my Lord, ſuffer not upon earth any habitation of the Unbelievers.</hi> Then Almighty God commanded him to build the Ship; then he ſmote them with Sterility, as well to the Fruits of the earth, as the Procreation of

children, making their women unable to bring forth, and in like manner the Females of their Cattel incapable of generation, and withdrawing his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions from their Orchards and Agriculture. They invoked their Idols, but it did beſtead them nothing with God. Then <hi>Noah</hi> began to build the Ship, and ſpent three years in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down <hi>Indian</hi> Plane-trees and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them, in making Nails and Pins, and providing whatever was neceſſary; then he ſet it together in the moneth of <hi>Regebe.</hi> Thoſe of his Nation would needs paſs by him as he was at work, laughing and making ſport at him.

When God would <note place="margin">2156 Years from <hi>Adam</hi> to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</note> reſtore the Earth to a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he ſent a wind upon the water which dry'd it, and put a ſtop to the Springs. The ordinary light return'd to the World, and the Sun and the Moon, and the Night, and the Day. Forty days after God commanded <hi>Noah</hi> to open the Ark. He opened it, and let out the Raven to ſee how low the water was. The Raven went out, and ſtayed to feed on the Carrions of the dead, and returned no more. Whereupon <hi>Noah</hi> made imprecations againſt her, that ſhe might always be a Stranger, and never a domeſtick Bird, and that it ſhould feed on Carrions. Then he let out the Dove after her. She ſoon return'd with her feet dy'd with the ſlime of the Earth, which was grown hot. Wherefore <hi>Noah</hi> prayed God to preſerve her ſwiftneſs
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62433:75"/>
to her, and that ſhe might be a dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Bird, and belov'd of Men. He pray'd him alſo to give her patience to endure the loſs of her young ones, and gave her his benediction; her feet have been red from that very time. He let her go ſeven days after, and ſhe return'd bringing an Olive-leaf in her Beak; and told him for news, that there was not remaining on the ſurface of the Earth any Tree but the Olive-tree. They ſay, the Earth was dry the 27th. day of the 11th. Moneth of the year. After that God revealed to <hi>Noah,</hi> that he ſhould let out the Beaſts and the Reptiles out of the Ark. <hi>Noah</hi> cry'd out ſo violently at it, that he fell into a Feaver.</p>
            <p>They ſay, thoſe who were in the <note place="margin">The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſnee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes out a Swine, the Lion a Cat.</note> Ark were incommodated with the dung of the Creatures, which oblig'd <hi>Noah</hi> to give a cuff o'th'Ear to the Elephant, by vertue of which cuff the Elephant ſneez'd and caſt out a Hog, which took away that ordure. They ſay alſo that the Rats troubling them, <hi>Noah</hi> gave a box o'th'Ear to the Lion, who ſneez'd out a Cat, which devour'd the Rats. Others ſay theſe ſtories were invented for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62433:76"/>
pleaſure ſake, and that they are not of faith, as having no grounds. <hi>Noah</hi> came afterwards out of the Ark with his four Sons, <hi>Sem, Cham, Japhet,</hi> and <hi>Jacheton,</hi> which is he whom God gave him in the Ship. Then God ſaid thus to them; <q>Multiply, fill the Earth, and cultivate it; I give you my benediction, and take my curſe from the Earth, permitting it to bring forth its good things, its fruits and productions</q>. Then he added ſpeaking to them; <q>Eat that which is permitted and good, and ſhun what is impure, as Beaſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd to Idols, or naturally dead, and Swine's Fleſh, and whatever hath been Sacrific'd to any other then God. Kill no man, for God forbids the doing of it, unleſs it be by the way of Juſtice.</q> It is written in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that after they were come out of the Ark and ſettled in the Earth, God ſpake thus to them; <q>Multiply and fill the Earth, let the Beaſts of it fear and reſpect you, and all the Fowls in the Air, and all the Fiſh in the Sea.</q> In the great <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> it is ſpoken of this in theſe terms; Then it was ſaid to him,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62433:76"/>
               <hi>O</hi> Noah, <hi>deſcend out of the Ark in peace on our part,</hi> and the reſt of the Verſe. Then <hi>Noah</hi> ordered them to built eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one a Habitation, whereupon they built fourſcore of them in the City, which is to this day called the City of <hi>Themanine,</hi> that is, <hi>Fourſcore.</hi> They afterwards fell a Sowing and Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Trees. They had ready for that end the Seeds, the Corn, and the Fruit, which had been put up in the Ship; there was onely the Vine, that <note place="margin">The Vine, and the part the Devil hath in it.</note> is the Tree which bears Grapes, which <hi>Noah</hi> wanted and could not find. Whereupon <hi>Gabriel</hi> told him that the Devil had ſtoln it away, as having ſome part in it. <hi>Noah</hi> thereupon ſent for him, and when he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he ſaid to him; <q>O curſed Spirit, why haſt thou done this? Becauſe I have part in it, ſaid the Devil. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it then between you, ſaid <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel.</hi> I am content ſaid <hi>Noah;</hi> I reſign him the fourth part of it. 'Tis not enough for him, ſaid <hi>Gabriel.</hi> Well, ſaid <hi>Noah,</hi> I will take one half, let him take the other. It is not yet enough, ſaid <hi>Gabriel;</hi> but he muſt have two thirds of it, and thou one. When therefore the juice of it ſhall
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62433:77"/>
have boyl'd over the fire, till two thirds thereof be conſum'd, thou ſhalt be allow'd the uſe of the reſt; and in like manner the Grape as well new as dry, and the Viniger. As to the ſurpluſage which may inebriate, it is forbidden thee and thy poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; thou art not to expect any part thereof from the Devil, nor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence any action againſt him for it.</q> Then the Devil (God hinder him from doing harm) ſaid thus to <hi>Noah,</hi> (Gods peace be with him;) <q>I am oblig'd to you for the great kindneſs you have done me, and for which I ſhall not be ungrateful. O <hi>Noah,</hi> beware of Envy, Intemperance, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, and Impatience. For Envy enclin'd me to make God incenſed againſt me, and was the cauſe of my baniſhment out of Paradice. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance made your Father <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſs the Commandment of his Lord, and eat the fruit of the Tree. Avarice made <hi>Cabel</hi> kill his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abel:</hi> And Impatience brought you to make imprecations againſt your Nation, which cauſed God to bring deſtruction on all, and hath given a relaxation of the pains I
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62433:77"/>
took to deceive them.</q> Then <hi>Noah</hi> cauſed the Shrine wherein <hi>Adams</hi> body <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Noah</hi>'s Shrine.</note> was, to be brought into the Cave of Old Age at <hi>Meca,</hi> and left it there. The Hiſtory relates, that when <hi>Noah</hi> took the Scorpion and the Serpent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ship with him, he pray'd his Almighty and All-good Lord, to take away their venom from them, which was granted. When therefore he put them out of it they ſpoke thus to him: <q>O Prophet of God, pray your <note place="margin">The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of the Scorpion and the Serpent.</note> Lord for us, that he would reſtore us our venom, and that we may make our advantage thereof againſt our enemies, and by means thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelves againſt thoſe who would injure us. We promiſe you in requital, and in the name of God we grant, that whoever ſhall every day and every night pronounce theſe words, <hi>God grant peace to</hi> Noah <hi>for ever,</hi> we will not come near him, and will do him no hurt.</q> 
               <hi>Noah</hi> pray'd to his Lord, and he order'd the making of that agreement, and that ſecurity to be taken of them: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had done it God reſtored to them their venom, according to what he had ordain'd by his Providence,

            <p>The firſt of the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Deluge was <hi>Maſar,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Meſraim,</hi> (who is <hi>Banſar)</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gham,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Noah,</hi> to whom God grant peace and mercy. This <hi>Maſar</hi> was ſon to the daughter of the Prieſt <hi>Philemon,</hi> who believed in <hi>Noah.</hi> For they ſay that <hi>Pharaan</hi> (the laſt of the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> before the Delugu) grew proud upon the earth, and treated his people inſolently and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically, taking away their goods, and committing Injuſtices, ſuch as none had done before or after him; and ſhedding Mens bloud by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual murthers. Nay, Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were afraid of him, and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. He it was who writ to <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſel</hi> the ſon of <hi>Mechavel</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and adviſed him to put <hi>Noah</hi> to death. <hi>Darmaſel</hi> had already writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Inhabitants of <hi>Gueraca,</hi> and of all the other Provinces, to know of them whether there were any other Gods beſides the Idols; and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62433:79"/>
had related to them the Hiſtory of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the Religion which he preached, and how he incited them to the worſhip of one onely God, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe whom they adored. Every one of them had rejected this, and had adviſed him to put <hi>Noah</hi> to death. But after God had commanded <hi>Noah</hi> to build the Ark, <hi>Pharaan</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> writ to <hi>Darmaſel,</hi> exhorting him to fire it; which <hi>Darmaſel</hi> thought to do, but at the ſame time the Prince of the Prieſts of <hi>Egypt (Philemon)</hi> gave him other advice; <note place="margin">Philemon.</note> and writ to him that he counſelled him to leave it as it was, in regard that if what that man ſaid was true, that is, what <hi>Noah</hi> ſaid, the King ſhould embarque with thoſe of his houſe, and then put <hi>Noah</hi> to death that he might be no more troubled with him. The Learned of <hi>Egypt</hi> knew well that the Deluge was to come, but knew not how great it was to be, nor how long it was to continue on the ſurface of the earth. The Prieſt <hi>Philemon</hi> dreamt as he ſlept, that he ſaw <hi>Emſos</hi> (which is the City of <hi>Maſre)</hi> overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon its Inhabitants, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols falling with their Noſes to the

ground; and that there deſcended from Heaven men armed with ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Inſtruments of Iron, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they beat the people; and that he ſeemed to approach one of them, and ſpoke to him thus; <q>Why treat you the men after that manner? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (replied he) they are ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and irreſpective towards their God, who hath created them, and gives them ſubſiſtence. Is there no means for them to be ſaved? ſaid <hi>Philemon.</hi> Yes, replied the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: thoſe who would be ſaved are onely to apply themſelves to him who hath built the Ark.</q> 
               <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> awaked thereupon very much aſtoniſhed. He had a wife and two children, a ſon and a daughter, and ſeven of his Diſciples. He therefore ſettled his affairs, with an intention to go to <hi>Noah,</hi> Gods peace be with him. Then afterwards he ſaw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dream; He ſeem'd to be in a green Medow, where there were white Birds which ſmell'd of Musk; and as he ſtood ſtill to take a view of them, and to admire their beauty, one of them began to ſpeak, ſaying to the reſt; <q>Let us go, let us deliver the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62433:80"/>
Believers. Whereupon <hi>Philemon</hi> ſaid to him, Who are thoſe Believers? They are (replied the Bird) the men of the Ark.</q> He thereupon awaked very much aſtoniſhed and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and related that to thoſe of his Houſe and his Diſciples. Then he went and ſpoke to the King in theſe terms; <q>I have ſeen a Dream, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which if it pleaſe Your Majeſty to ſend me to <hi>Darmaſel</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> I ſhall know what that man is who hath built a Ship in a dry Countrey. I will diſcourſe with him, and diſpute againſt him about this new Religion which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and would introduce, and will inform my ſelf of the truth of his pretenſions; and I hope at length to turn him out of the way which he would have others to follow.</q> The King approved the deſign, and ordered him to depart. <hi>Philemon</hi> then left <hi>Egypt,</hi> with his Family and his Diſciples, and travelled till he came to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and diſcourſed with <hi>Noah,</hi> Gods peace be with him, ſo as that he found what he ſaid to be true, and believed in him, and followed his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <q>When God will put a man
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62433:80"/>

               <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> continued with <hi>Noah</hi> ever after, and ceaſed not to ſerve him and his Children, and his Family, and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, till they imbarqued with him in the Ark.</p>
            <p>Mean time <hi>Pharaan</hi> (God curſe him) <note place="margin">Pharaan.</note> continued his divertiſements, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in his errour, unworthily treating the people of <hi>Egpyt,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting them by his Injuſtices and Murthers, which cauſed many Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Spoils in the Countrey, and dearth of proviſions, Men op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing one another, and no body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving vice. The Temples and the <hi>Birbas</hi> were lock'd up, and their doors full of dirt. The Deluge came upon them, and the Rain overwhelm'd them on Sunday the 24th. day of the Moneth, <hi>Pharaan</hi> being then drunk; ſo that he came not to himſelf till the water began to faſten on him. He ſtarted up of a ſudden, and ran away as faſt as he could; but his feet ſunk into the ground, and he fell on his Face, and fell a roaring like a Bull, till the Unbeliever periſh'd, he and all his Nation.

               <hi>Noah</hi> took her and married her to <hi>Meſraim,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> to whom ſhe bore a Son, whom his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Philemon</hi> named <hi>Maſar.</hi> When <hi>Noah</hi> would afterwards divide the Earth amongſt his Children, <hi>Philemon</hi> ſpoke to him in theſe terms; <q>O Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God, ſend along with me this my Son, (meaning <hi>Maſar)</hi> and permit me to bring him into my own Countrey, to ſhew him the Treaſures of it, and to teach him the Sciences and remarkable things thereof.</q> 
               <hi>Noah</hi> ſent him along with him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſome of his own Houſe. He was a delicate young man, and they travelled during the great heat of the Sun, ſo that when they came near the Land of <hi>Egypt, Maſar</hi> made a kind of Arbour of the Boughs of Trees, at the place now called <hi>Gariſa,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Arbour,</hi> and covered <note place="margin">Gariſa.</note> it with the Graſs he found on the ground.

were ſoft with them from the break of day till the afternoon; and that they made what they would of them. <hi>Philemon</hi> taught them alſo to make Taliſmans; for there came out againſt them out of the Sea certain Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which threw down their Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whereupon they made Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans againſt thoſe Creatures, and they never came afterwards.

Then he enquir'd of her who <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and of what Religion. <q>He is the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God; (reply'd ſhe) his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the profeſſion of the Unity of the Almighty, and he is my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.

He had a Kive 30 Cubits about, which being filled full of meat for him he eat up all; then they filled it with wine, and he drank it off. He happened to have the plague in his body, which put him to great pain, increaſing every day; whereupon his Phyſicians adviſed him to ſend ſome of his people about the Countrey to find out for him a ſoil, whereof the Air and Waters were agreeable to his Temperament. Theſe gave him an account of the Countrey of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which obliged him to come thither, after he had drawn up his Forces together, and diſtributed Money and Arms among them. He brought along with him 4000 <hi>Gadites,</hi> every one of whom car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a ſtone of the breadth of the <hi>Nile</hi>

preſented to him all theſe Rarities, which he willingly received: Then ſhe told him that the Queen of <hi>Egypt</hi> was in Love with him, and deſirous to Marry him, and far from refuſing ſo advantageous a Match. This news made him jocund, and put him into a good humour. He return'd her this anſwer; <q>Promiſe the Queen from me for a Marriage-gift what you pleaſe your ſelf. The Queen (reply'd ſhe) needs not any thing of yours, ſince your affairs will hence forth be common; but ſhe deſires of you inſtead of a Marriage-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that you cauſe a City to be built in her Land, on the ſide of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea, that it may be an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mark to her to the end of the World; and that it may be a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of your power; and that you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in the Building of it theſe Stones and theſe Pillars which you have brought with you to dam up the Chanel of the <hi>Nile.</hi>
               </q> He grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Requeſt, and entered into the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> with his Forces, and founded the City on the Weſt-ſide, at the place where now <hi>Alexandria</hi> is; to that end encamping himſelf and his <note place="margin">Alexandria.</note>

Army on the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea-ſide. <hi>Charoba</hi> ſent him ſeveral ſorts of Preſents and Refreſhments. <hi>Alexandria</hi> was then ruin'd, ever ſince the <hi>Gadites</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> for it had been founded by <hi>Sedad,</hi> the Son of <hi>Gad,</hi> who had a deſign to bring thither whatever was moſt precious in all the quarters of the Earth, for he was the Monarch of the World Eaſt and Weſt. But the Deſtroyer of Caſtles prevented him, I mean Death, which none can divert or avoid; yet were there ſome tracks of it as ſome affim. <hi>Gebirus</hi> cauſed to be brought thither the Stones, and the Pillars, and aſſembled the Artiſts and the Engineers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charoba</hi> ſent him alſo a thouſand Handy-craftsmen. He ſpent a long time in Building, ſo that his money was exhauſted, and his people could do no more. For when they had built and made ſome advancement, as ſoon as the evening was come, while they took their reſt in the night, they were aſtoniſh'd in the morning, that they could find no ſign of what they had done. For there came out of the Sea certain people who took away all into the ſalt waters. <hi>Gebirus</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:62433:93"/>
was extreamly troubled and afflicted thereat. <hi>Charoba</hi> ſent him a thouſand Goats or Sheep, which were milk'd for the Kings Kitchin. They were kept by a Shepherd belonging to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birus,</hi> of whom he had received that charge. This Shepherd led them out to graze, accompany'd by a great many other Shepherds, upon the Sea ſide. One day this Shepherd (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put the Beaſts into the cuſtody of the other Shepherds, who obeyed <note place="margin">The Nymph <hi>Marina.</hi>
               </note> him) being a beautiful perſon, and of a good Aſpect and Stature, ſaw a fair young Lady iſſuing out of the Sea, which came towards him, and being come very near him ſaluted him; he return'd the ſalutation, and ſhe began to ſpeak to him with all imaginable courteſie and civility, and ſaid to him; <q>Young man, would you wreſtle with me for ſomething which I ſhould lay againſt you? What would you lay? reply'd the Shepherd. If you give me a fall (ſays the young Lady) I will be yours, and you ſhall diſpoſe of me as you pleaſe; and if I give you a fall, I will have a beaſt out of your Flock. Content, ſaid the Shepherd;</q> and thereupon he went
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62433:94"/>
towards her, and ſhe came towards him. He began to wreſtle with her, but ſhe immediately flung him, and took a beaſt out of the Flock, which ſhe carried away with her into the Sea. She came afterwards every evening, and did the like, ſo that the Shepherd was over head and ears in love with her. The Flock diminiſh'd, and the Shepherd himſelf pin'd away. One day King <hi>Gebirus</hi> paſſing by the Shepherd, found him ſitting near his Flock very penſive, which obliged him to come nearer him, and to ſpeak thus to him: <q>What misfortune hath befell thee? Why do I find thee ſo fallen away? Thy Flock is ſo too, it diminiſhes and grows worſe and worſe every day, and gives leſs Milk then ordinarily it uſed to do.</q> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Shepherd told him the ſtory of the young Lady. He was aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, and ſaid to him; <q>At what time does this Lady come thus to ſee thee? In the evening (reply'd the Shepherd) when the Sun is ready to ſet.</q> Upon that <hi>Gebirus</hi> lighted off his Beaſt, and ſaid to the Shepherd; <q>Take off thy Garment and ſtrip thy ſelf.</q> The Shepherd obey'd, and the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62433:94"/>
King put on the Shepherds garment, cloathed himſelf like him, and ſate in his place. A while after behold the young Lady, who was already come out of the Sea, comes to ſalute him. He returned the ſalute, and ſhe ſaid to him; <q>Wilt thou wreſtle any more on the ſame terms we have done already? With all my heart, ſaid the King.</q> Immediately ſhe came near him, and endeavoured to caſt him down; but <hi>Gebirus</hi> gave her a fall preſently, and violently cruſh'd her. Whereupon ſhe ſaid to him, <q>You are not my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary match. No, ſaid the King. Since I cannot avoid being taken (ſaid ſhe) put me into the hands of my former match; for he has treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me courteouſly, and I have tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his heart many times: mean time he hath captivated me as I have captivated him. In requital I will teach you the way to complete this Building, as you deſire.</q> After therefore he had put her into the hands of the Shepherd, he deſired her to tell him whence came that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened every day to his Building; and if there were any means to make it continue in that condition whereto
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62433:95"/>
they brought it. <q>There are, reply'd ſhe; but know, great Prince, that the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> is a Land of Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that the Sea there is full of Spirits and Demons, which aſſiſt them to carry on their affairs, and that they are thoſe who take away your Buildings. But what means is there to prevent it? ſaid the King. To do that (ſaid ſhe) you ſhall make great Veſſels of Tranſparent glaſs, with Covers thereto, which may <note place="margin">Painters in the bottom of the Sea.</note> keep the waters from entering in; and you ſhall put into them Men well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skill'd in Painting, and with them Meat and Drink for a week, and Cloaths, and Pencils, and whatever is neceſſary for Painting. Then you ſhall ſtop the Veſſels well, after you have faſtened them at the top with ſtrong Cords, and ty'd them to the Ships, and then you ſhall let them go into the Sea like Anchors, and you ſhall put at the top of the cords little Bells, which the Painters ſhall ring; and then I will tell you what it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that you ſhould do.</q> 
               <hi>Gebirus</hi> did all ſhe had ordered him; he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Veſſels to be made, and brought the Painters before her, who
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62433:95"/>
heard all ſhe ſaid to him; then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them great wealth and honours, and they promiſed him to do his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They therefore put theſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to the bottom of the Sea, after they had ſtopped them well above, and faſtened them with cord, and left them there a week: after which the Painters rung the Bells, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were taken out of the water, and they opened the Veſſels, out of which they took along with them the Draughts they had made. The King preſented them afterwards to the young Lady <hi>Marina,</hi> and ſhe ſaid to them; <q>Make now Statues of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Tin, and Stone, and Earth, and Wood, reſembling your Draughts, and ſet them on the Sea-ſide, before the Buildings you ſhall make: for then the Beaſts of the Sea, when they ſhall come out to demoliſh your Buildings as they are wont, ſeeing thoſe Figures, will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they are companies of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons like themſelves, come to fight with them, and they will preſently return to the place whence they came.</q> The Painters and Gravers did ſo, and by that means <hi>Gebirus</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:62433:96"/>
completed his Structure as he deſired. After that he ſpoke thus to the Nymph, <q>Behold all the Money we had hath been expended in the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this City; know you not where there is ſome Treaſure in this Land? for the City is not yet finiſhed, and we have no more Money. There is (reply'd the Nymph) in this ruin'd <note place="margin">The Seven Tombs.</note> City (ſhe meant <hi>Alexandria)</hi> on the one ſide of your Building an empty round place, and about that place there are ſeven Pillars, with a brazen Statue ſtanding on the top of each of them; Sacrifice to every one of thoſe Statues a fat Bull, and cauſe the Pillar under it to be rubb'd with the blood of the Bull, then perfume it with the hair of his Tail, and with ſomewhat you ſhall cauſe to be ſhaved from his Horns and his Hoofs, and ſpeak thus to it: Behold the Offering I make to thee, let me therefore have what is about thee. Having done and ſaid this, meaſure from every Pillar, on that ſide that the Statue upon it ſhall have its face turned, the ſpace of a hundred Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, then cauſe people to dig there. You ſhall do all this when the Moon
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62433:96"/>
is at full, and <hi>Saturn</hi> direct. After you have digg'd fifty Cubits, you will find a great Floor; cauſe it to be rubb'd with the gall of the Bull, then taken away; for thence you will deſcend into a Cave 50 Cubits in length, at the end whereof you will find a Store-houſe made of ſtone, and made faſt with a Lock, the Key whereof ſhall be under the Threſhold of the Door; take it and rub the Door with what ſhall be left of the Bulls gall, and perfume it with the ſhavings of the Horns and Hoofs of the ſame Animal, and the hair of his Tail; for then it ſhall open. You ſhall afterwards expect till the Winds that ſhall be within get out; when they ſhall be calmed, enter; for you will meet with an Idol of Braſs, having about its neck a plate of the ſame metal, on which you will find written whatever is in the Store-houſes, of Silver, precious Stones, Statues, and other Wonders. Take thereof what you pleaſe, but make no ſtay before a dead perſon whom you ſhall find there, and let not what there is upon him of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels and precious Stones give you
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62433:97"/>
occaſion of envy. Do afterwards as much to every Pillar and its Statue, you will find there again as much Wealth in a like Store-houſe; for they are the Tombs of ſeven Kings buried with their Treaſures.</q> 
               <hi>Gebirus</hi> having heard this diſcourſe of the Nymph was extremely ſatisfy'd. He punctually did all ſhe had ſaid to him, and found great wealth, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deſcribed, and abundance of rare and admirable things. By this means he completed the Building of the City, which coming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Charoba,</hi> ſhe was very much diſpleaſed thereat, and fell into a great diſturbance. For her intention was only to weary out the King, and to reduce him to an impoſſibility. They ſay that among other Miracles which <hi>Gebirus</hi> found there, there was a little golden Cabinet, ſeal'd up with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Seal; and that having open'd it, he found in it a Box made of red precious Stones, and full of a green Powder, in the form of a <hi>Collyrium,</hi> (or Eye-Medicine) the mouth of which Box was in like manner ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with a green Emerald, and that upon the Cabinet there was written;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62433:97"/>
               <hi>He who ſhall uſe this Collyry ſhall grow young again, his hair ſhall grow black again, and his ſight ſhall be clear'd, that he ſhall be able to ſee all ſorts of Spirits.</hi> He there found alſo the Figure of an <hi>Ic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>neumon</hi> (or <hi>Egyptian</hi> Rat) made of Gold, which being expoſed to the Air the Sky was overcaſt, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately there came Rain. He there found moreover a Seat of Marble, on which there was the Figure of a Raven, made of a black Stone, which being queſtioned ſpoke, and anſwered to what was asked of it. They ſay that in each of thoſe Store-houſes there were ten Miraculous things, which it would be long to declare one after another; wherefore we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with what we have briefly ſaid thereof. After <hi>Gebirus</hi> (ſaith the Author) had acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Building of the City, he ſent the tidings of it to <hi>Charoba,</hi> and invited her to come and ſee it. It was <note place="margin">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62433:98"/>
the Seat in which you ſhall ſit, and afterwards divide your people into three parties, and ſend them to me that I may give them a Treatment ſuch as they deſerve. When the firſt party ſhall be about a third part of the way, you ſhall ſend away the ſecond, then afterwards the third, to the end they may be near us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in the Countrey for our ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</q> He did ſo, and in the mean time ſhe continued ſending to him precious Houſhold-ſtuff, till ſuch time as ſhe knew that they were upon their way, and that he had ſent to her the third part of his Army. Then ſhe cauſed to be ſet for them Tables, repleniſh'd with Poiſoned Meats and Drinks, and when they were come to the Tables, her Servants Men and Maids made them ſtay and ſit down to eat, ſtanding all about them with Umbrellos or Fans; ſo that they all died from the firſt to the laſt. They afterwards quitted that Poſt, and paſſed to the other, where the ſecond party met them, whom they treated after the ſame manner. Then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the third, and ſerv'd them as they had done the others, ſo that all
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62433:98"/>
died. After that ſhe ſent word to the King, that ſhe had left his Army in her own City, and in her Caſtle and thereabouts, for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Women; and that ſhe would be ſerved by his Attendants, who ſhould be about him ready to obey him. Accordingly ſhe went to his Palace, accompanied by her Nurſe and ſome of her meaner Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were with her, and carried Perfumes in Porcelain Diſhes. He roſe up and went to meet her, and immediately her Nurſe put about him a ſumptuous Robe, but poiſoned, which ſhe had prepared for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and blew a Fume into his face, which in a manner deprived him of his ſenſes; then ſhe ſprinkled him with a water which ſhe had, which looſened all his members, and diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated all his joyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that he fell to the ground in a ſwound. Then ſhe opened his veins, and emptied them of all his bloud, ſaying, The bloud of Kings is an excellent remedy. Her Nurſe came up to him, and ſaid to him; <q>Is the King well to night? Miſchief on your coming hither, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he;) may you be treated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62433:99"/>
Do you ſtand in need of any thing (replied ſhe) before you taſte death. I do, ſaid he; I would intreat thee to cauſe theſe words to be engraved upon one of the pillars of the Caſtle: <hi>I Gebirus the ſon of Gevirus the Mutaphequian, who have cauſed Marble to be poliſhed, and the hard red ſtone and the green to be wrought; who have been poſſeſſed of Gold and Precious ſtones; who have built Palaces, and raiſed Armies; who have cut through Mountains, who have ſtopped Rivers with my arm: with all this my power, and my might, and my proweſs, and my valour, I have been circumvented by the artifices of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, weak, impotent, and of no worth; who hath deprived me of my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and taken my life, and diſcomfited my Armies. Whoever therefore is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to proſper, though there be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity in this world, let him have a care of the wilely ſubtilties of Women. This is the advice I give thoſe who ſhall come after me. I have no more to ſay.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roba</hi> thereupon commanded his head to be cut off, and that it ſhould be ſet upon the gate of the City of <hi>Memphis;</hi> which was put in executtion by her

people. After that ſhe cauſed the Tower of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to be built, and to be graved thereon her own name, and that of <hi>Gebirus,</hi> and what ſhe had done to him, and the time when the City had been built. Her fame came to the ears of Kings, who reſpected and eſteemed her, and made ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and proffers of obedience to her. She did ſince that many miraculous things in <hi>Egypt:</hi> among others ſhe cauſed Caſtles and Bridges to be made upon the Frontiers, and put Garriſons of Souldiers therein, to be a Guard, and to repell Enemies on which ſide ſoever they came to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. They ſay that <hi>Gebirus</hi> made this diſcourſe to her at the point of death; <q>O <hi>Charoba,</hi> triumph not <note place="margin">

her Men and Women-ſervants who were about her: whileſt ſhe was in the height of her mirth and jollity ſhe trod on a Serpent, which ſtung her in the heel, and made her immediately loſe her ſight. <q>Wo is me! cried ſhe. It will prove nothing (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam) replied her Attendants. You are deceived, ſaid ſhe; the day which <hi>Gebirus</hi> threatened me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all is come.</q> Accordingly ſhe died he next morning.</p>

She cauſed the body of <hi>Charoba</hi> to be embalmed in <hi>Camphire,</hi> and brought into the City which ſhe had built on the Weſt ſide.

When the time of the going forth of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> was come, Almighty God ſent <hi>Gabriel,</hi> (Gods peace be with him) who took up by his Order from above the earth the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and the <hi>Black Stone,</hi> and the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> which is the place of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (Gods peace and mercy be with him) and the Shrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi>

(Gods peace be with him) with what was within it, and theſe five Rivers mentioned before. All this was taken up into Heaven. And that is it which the Almighty ſaith, <hi>And it is in our power to carry it away: and when I have taken up theſe things from the earth, the Inhabitants of it were the choice part of Religion and of the World.</hi> And citing his Authors he ſpeaks thus: <q>I have heard <hi>Abula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamus</hi> the <hi>Bahelian,</hi> and <hi>Gabdollus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Baſar</hi> the <hi>Mazenian,</hi> who ſaid; The Apoſtle of God (Gods peace and mercy be with him) one day called his Companions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſaid to them; The All-mighty and All-good God ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you to conquer <hi>Egypt</hi> after me.

ſecond of Milk, the third of Water, and the fourth of Honey.</q> Then the All-mighty and All-good God ſaid; <hi>I have made my particular ſtandard of the Lord of Rivers,</hi> which is the <hi>Nile,</hi> in the book of God, and it is a River flowing out of Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megavius</hi> ask'd <hi>Cabay</hi> and ſaid to him, <q>I ask thee in the Name of the great <note place="margin">Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Nile.</hi>

               <hi>Jezidus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Chebibus</hi> ſpeaks thus of it; <q>When <hi>Moſes</hi> called upon God againſt <hi>Pharao</hi> and his Servants, God hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Nile</hi> to encreaſe as much as it would have done. Then they had recourſe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and deſired him to pray to God for them, which
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62433:103"/>
he did, hoping they would believe in God. This happened during the time they adored the Croſs. The next morning God had augmented the <hi>Nile</hi> for them 16 full Cubits.</q> 
               <hi>Quiſus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Chagegus</hi> affirms, that ſomebody related it to him, that <hi>Gamrou</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gazus,</hi> after he had conquered <hi>Egypt,</hi> having entered into it in the moneth of <hi>Baune,</hi> which is one of the barbarous moneths, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Countrey came to him and ſaid, <q>Lord Commander, our <hi>Nile</hi> which you here ſee governs its courſe according to a Law which it inviolably obſerves. What Law is that? ſays <hi>Gamrou.</hi> When the 12th. of this preſent moneth is come (ſaid they) we take a young Maid, a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, <note place="margin">A young Virgin Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for that end.</note> from her Father and Mother, after we have ſatisfied them both, and made them condeſcend to what we would do according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, we dreſs and adorn her with Jewels and Sumptuous Clothes, then we bring her in the night time, and caſt her into the <hi>Nile,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately it increaſes, and ſpreads, and raiſes its courſe. This cannot be continued (ſaid <hi>Gamrou)</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62433:104"/>
to the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Law; for the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Law deſtroyes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane cuſtoms that have been in vogue before her.</q> So the Moneth <hi>Banne,</hi> and the Moneth <hi>Abibe,</hi> and the Moneth <hi>Meſri,</hi> paſs'd away, and the <hi>Nile</hi> encreaſed not its courſe, neither more nor leſs, ſo that the Inhabitants of <hi>Egypt</hi> were upon thoughts of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Countrey. <hi>Gamrou</hi> ſeeing that, writ of it to the Commander of the Faithful <hi>Omar,</hi> (Gods peace be with him) acquainted him with what the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had ſaid to him, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know his reſolution thereupon. <hi>Omar</hi> made him anſwer in theſe terms: <hi>After that, O</hi> Gamrou, <hi>you have done what you ought to have done upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, for the</hi> Muſſulman <hi>Law aboliſhes the evil cuſtoms that have preceded it. But I have incloſed a Note within the fold of this preſent Letter, when you have read it, take that Note and caſt it into the</hi> Nile, <hi>and God will do what he ſhall think fit. Gamrou</hi> having receiv'd the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, took the Note out of it, on which he found theſe words written: <hi>In the Name of God, Gracious and Merciful; God bleſs</hi> Mahumet <hi>and his Family; From</hi> Gabdol Omar, <hi>the ſon of</hi> Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabus,

               <hi>Commander of the</hi> Faithful, <hi>to the</hi> Nile <hi>of</hi> Egypt. <hi>After that, If thou haſt flow'd hitherto onely by thy own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, flow no more; but if it hath been the Only and Almighty God that hath cauſed thee to flow, we pray the Only Great and All-mighty God to make thee flow again. Gods peace and mercy be with</hi> Mahumet <hi>the Idiot-Prophet, and his Family. Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou</hi> took the Note, and came to the <hi>Nile</hi> one day before they celebrated the Feaſt of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and others being ready to leave the Countrey; for they could not carry on their affairs, nor ſubſiſt therein, but by the annual overflowing of the <hi>Nile:</hi> but the next morning they found that God had cauſed the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to riſe ſixteen Cubits in one night. So God delivered the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> out of that affliction; praiſe and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving be to him for it.</p>

               <hi>Gabdol</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gamrou,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus,</hi> (Gods peace be with them both) ſpeaks thus of the <hi>Nile;</hi> 
               <q>The <hi>Nile</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> is the Lord of Rivers; God obliges all the Rivers from the the Eaſt to the Weſt to wait on it at the time of its overflowing; he turns them all into its Chanel, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62433:105"/>
increaſes its courſe with their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. When God would have the <hi>Nile</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> to overflow, for the convenience of the Inhabitants, the other Rivers lend it their waters, and God cauſes new Springs to riſe out of the Earth. When its courſe is riſen to the height that God would, he orders the waters to return to their Sources.</q> God All-mighty ſpeaks thus of it; <hi>And we have made them to iſſue out of the Gardens and the Fountains, and out of the manured lands, and out of the precious places.</hi> The Gardens (ſaith he) were the two ſides of the <hi>Nile,</hi> from its beginning to its end, upon both the Banks, between <hi>Syene</hi> and <hi>Raſid. Egypt</hi> had then ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Cubits of water, accounting from the loweſt part of the flat Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. They empty'd and filled the Chanels and Rivulets of it every year. What was yet more noble were the Places appointed for Orations, which were a thouſand in number, upon which they called upon God for <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao,</hi> and they pray'd him to grant him a long life, and to make him liberal, and of eaſie acceſs.</p>

Comment upon theſe words of <hi>Pharao, Is not the Kingdom of</hi> Egypt <hi>mine?</hi> and the reſt of the Verſe, peaks thus: There was then no greater King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth then the King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for all the other Kings ſtood in need of <hi>Egypt.</hi> All the Currents were made with the hands of Men, and the Aqueducts, and the Fountains, and the Bridges, all according to Meaſure and Geometrical proportion. They drew them out of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and brought them into all their Houſes, and into all their Caſtles, and made them flow under the places of their Habitations, detaining them when they pleaſed, and diſmiſſing them in like manner. <hi>Mechacol,</hi> the Son of <hi>Tabicus,</hi> ſpeaks of it in theſe terms; I have read a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Books upon the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and have found in one of them, that there are ſeven Climats in the world, which pray to God every year weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crying, and ſay; O Lord, ſend plenty into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and make its <hi>Nile</hi> flow. For when <hi>Egypt</hi> is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd we have Meat and Drink e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.

the ſon of <hi>Gamrou</hi> ſaid; By the true God, I know not any year, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Inhabitants of <hi>Egypt</hi> went out of their Countrey, to ſeek a ſubſiſtence elſewhere. We ſhall never go out of it, ſays one of them, if ſome enemy do not force us thereto. Not ſo (reply'd he) but your <hi>Nile</hi> ſhall be ſwallowed under ground, ſo that there ſhall not be a drop of it left.

               <hi>Jezidus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Chebibus</hi> ſpeaks thus of it; The <hi>Nile</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the time of <hi>Pharao</hi> and the Precedent Kings had People appointed to make its Chanels, to repair its Bridges and Banks, and to clear its Rivulets and Trenches of Oziers, Ordures, Paper-plants, and what ever might obſtruct the courſe of the Water, when there was occaſion, to the number of ſix ſcore thouſand Work-men, always ready to work Winter and Summer, receiving their pay Monethly out of the publick Treaſury, as the Soldiery, as well by Sea as Land, receiv'd theirs out of the Kings Money. The ſon of <hi>Lahigus</hi> ſaith, that he heard it of one of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that the <hi>Nile</hi> one

            <p>An Abbridgement of what is ſaid <note place="margin">Pharao.</note> of <hi>Pharao,</hi> and how God deſtroy'd him by the Decree of his Divine Will. <hi>Gali</hi> the ſon of <hi>Abutalchus</hi> ſpeaks thus of him. <hi>Pharao</hi> King of <hi>Egpyt</hi> was a Dwarf, or little Man, but ſeven ſpans in height. Others ſay he was three Cubits high, and that his Beard was two Cubits long, ſo that when he ſate, he drew one Cubit of it on the ground before him. He twiſted up his Muſtachoes, and put them above his two ears. When the water of the <hi>Nile</hi> was turned into Blood in the time of <hi>Moſes, Pharao</hi> drunk the juice of Orange-leaves, with fine Sugar put into it. Some affirm he was of low Stature, mark'd with white ſpots, and that he trod on his Beard, it was ſo long. <hi>Abubeker</hi> the Truth-teller (Gods peace be with him) ſaid that <hi>Pharao</hi> had loſt all his Teeth.

I am not yet reconciled with you, ſaid he. If you make not the <hi>Nile</hi> flow as it is wont (replied they) we will make another God beſides you. This reply troubled him, but it was not in his power to do what they deſired.</q> His Viſier <hi>Haman</hi> was he who knew his ſecrets, who diſpoſed of all his affairs, who heard his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and eaſed him of his grief.

and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> confeſſing to him that he could not do what they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that that buſineſs of the <hi>Nile</hi> was beyond his ſtrength. <q>I cannot (ſaid he) take any courſe in this caſe, nor find any means to ſatisfie them.

Great King (replied <hi>Haman)</hi> they have not bethought themſelves of asking you a thing, which would have been much more impoſſible then this, and might have given them greater occaſion to proclame your weakneſs in all places. What is that? replied the King. If any one of them (ſaid <hi>Haman)</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought him of requiring you to raiſe up his father or brother after their death, that would have been more difficult to you then the affair of the <hi>Nile.</hi> Speak not of ſuch things, ſays <hi>Pharao;</hi> for Walls have ears.

Pray him that he would cauſe the <hi>Nile</hi> to flow for his Servants, for he is merciful and meek; he is not haſty, and fears not that he hath not done a thing ſoon enough.

Make an end (O <hi>Haman)</hi> as you have begun. I ſhall not fail, ſaid <hi>Haman.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to him the third time, and ſaid the ſame thing they had ſaid to him the two former times.

We were a Moneth at Sea, and made little Progreſs, the Wind being not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable. That Moneth paſt, there came a Wind which pleaſed them,

Finding themſelves ready to periſh, and to ſee their Veſſels ſplit to pieces, they reſolved to get out of that Road, fearing their Ships ſhould fall foul one upon another in the Sea, and ſaying; Let us rather make for any Coaſt whereto the Sea ſhall caſt us, though it were into the moſt remote parts of the world, and let us not ſtay here. They

By this means there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained no water in <hi>Geouna.</hi> That done, he got Labourers to cut down all the Reeds and Tamarisk that was in it, and carry it away, and then the <hi>Nile</hi> began to flow into it, and <hi>Geouna</hi> became pure and clean ground.

He governed them 130 years, that is, to his death, (Gods peace and mercy be with him.) O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affirm that he died at 130 years of age: God knows better then we do how it is.

what can you do more? replied they. I will put into <hi>Alphiom</hi> (ſaid he) a Family of every City in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they may there build a village for themſelves; ſo that there ſhall be in <hi>Alphiom</hi> as many villages as there ſhall be Cities in <hi>Egypt.</hi> When they have quite built their villages, I will bring into every village as much water as ſhall be requiſite, proportionably to the Land I ſhall have aſſigned it, ſo as there ſhall be neither too much nor too little. I will alſo have an Aqueduct come to every village, for the time that water cannot come there but under ground; and I will make it more deep for thoſe who are ſeated high, and leſs deep for ſuch as ſhall be low, according to the times and hours of the day and night. I will do all this for them by meaſure, ſo that every one ſhall have neither more nor leſs than is requiſite. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao</hi> anſwered him thereupon; This is of the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi> It is ſo, ſaid <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>

As to that which is now uſed, it was built by the <hi>Mamunus,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Harounes</hi> the Law-obſerver; Almighty God ſhew mercy to both: For when he entered into the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he found the Chriſtians negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in meaſuring the water, when by the permiſſion of God it encreaſed; which obliged him to ſpeak thus; <q>This is a miracle of God, wherein he hath put a myſtery, ſecret and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to any other beſides himſelf; therefore the care thereof belongs only to a <hi>Chenifian Muſſulman,</hi> who has Religion and Faith.</q> He afterwards advis'd with the Lawyers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who counſelled him to beſtow that charge on the Lawyer <hi>Gabdol,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gabdolſalem</hi> the Schoolmaſter.

and allotted him 7 Crowns of Gold monethly for his Penſion, which has ever ſince been continued to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours.

            <p>I have heard moreover (ſaid the <note place="margin">Alphiom III.</note> Author) a third ſtory upon the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Land of <hi>Alphiom,</hi> from <hi>Mahumet</hi> the Son of <hi>Gali,</hi> the Son of <hi>Gabdol,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sachar</hi> the <hi>Temini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who ſpoke of it in theſe terms, ſincerely citing the Author from whom he had it: <q>I have heard (ſaid he) of a man who was of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and well verſed in the Affairs of his countrey, and its Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and its Antiquities, living in a village named <hi>Phacat,</hi> that he had found it in a book, that <hi>Alphiom</hi> was
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62433:127"/>
heretofore a Land full of Briars and Thorns, where nobody lived; and that about that time the daughter of a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour having misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved her ſelf, and her offence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been notorious all over the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, even in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Iſlands of the Sea, her father reſolved to put her out of all places under his Juriſdiction, and to ſend her to Sea. He put aboard with her her Mother, her Servants, and all her Retinue, and whatever belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, and cauſed them to get out into the Main Sea; having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand ordered that Favourite of his whom he had entruſted with this affair, that when they met with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Winds, he ſhould diſpoſe the Ships to ſail into a countrey out of which they ſhould never return. This Order was put in execution, and the Sails were hoiſed in the midſt of the Sea, in the midſt of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt which blew every way, ſo that it carried away the Ships, and caſt the Princeſs with thoſe that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied her ſtreight into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where ſhe made up the <hi>Nile</hi> till ſhe came to the <hi>Manhi,</hi> at a place where now
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62433:128"/>
                  <hi>Lahon</hi> is. There ſhe went aſhore, and got on horſeback with ſome of her People to take a view of the Countrey, ſeeking a place where ſhe might make her habitation, and ſet up her reſt: for ſhe had been told her Fathers will, and knew it was his deſign ſhe ſhould have periſhed in the Sea. After much riding ſhe came to the place of <hi>Alphiom,</hi> and ſaw it covered with Briars, and Trees, and Paſtures, and Standing Waters, and compaſs'd all about as it were with the Sea; after ſhe had taken a full proſpect of it, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Ship, and ſaid to her Mother that ſhe had found a place where they might ſettle themſelves, and which they might cultivate for their ſubſiſtence; that there was not ſuch another in the world, and that ſhe had made choice of it for her aboad and retirement. Do what you pleaſe, ſaid her Mother to her. She therefore ſent her Retinue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on Mules which they had with them in their Ships; then they took their way, and advanced as far as <hi>Matartares,</hi> which is in the midſt of the City of <hi>Alphiom,</hi> remaining
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62433:128"/>
to this day. The water overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Alphiom</hi> from the <hi>Manhi</hi> when the <hi>Nile</hi> was at the higheſt; and when it was very low, the water eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from <hi>Alphiom.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſaw the water gone back from <hi>Alphiom,</hi> ſhe began to build Cities, to cut down what Trees were requiſite, and to clear the ground of the Reeds, the Paper-plants, and the Tamarisk which grew there. Then ſhe bethought her of a way to lay out the Money ſhe had brought with her, and ſent ſome of her Servants to the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and to the Cities, to get people together; ſo that there came to her a great number of poor people, and neceſſitous Tradeſmen, to whom ſhe diſtributed wherewithall to ſubſiſt, and did them many favours, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying them in digging the Chanel of the <hi>Manhi</hi> as far as <hi>Alphiem.</hi> They wrought it, and began the deſign thereof; but they afterwards found they could not bring it to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereupon they gave it over. This is manifeſtly ſeen at this day by the tracks that are left of it. It is on the Eaſt ſide of the City of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiom.</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:62433:129"/>

               <q>They relate moreover (ſays the Author) a fourth Story concerning <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alphiom</hi> IV.</note> the manner how the Land of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiom</hi> was peopled. <hi>Pharao</hi> (ſay theſe) commanded <hi>Joſeph</hi> to reduce it, and proportionably to diſtribute the waters which flowed thence. <hi>Joſeph</hi> did it, and ſo ſettled all, that it might laſt to the end of times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſurface of the earth.

            <p>As to <hi>Ioſeph</hi>'s Priſon in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Priſon.</note> the Benediction which God gives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prayers made there, this is one of the Stories related thereof.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62433:130"/>
               <hi>Caphor</hi> died afterwards, but <hi>Saphilmelic</hi> the <hi>Caid Guehar,</hi> ſervant of the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazzoldinill,</hi> entered into <hi>Egypt</hi> even while he governed it, and obtained of him the Reverſion of it. They ſay this <hi>Caphor</hi> (God ſhew him mercy) being one day very much troubled with a difficult and intricate buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, went himſelf to the Lawyer and Doctor of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who was then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bubeker</hi> the ſon of <hi>Chedad,</hi> and having ſaluted him ſaid thus to him: <q>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to name me ſome place where Prayers are infallibly heard, and ſhew me in what manner I ſhould pray for an Affair which hath happened to me, and hath already given me much diſquiet. Lord Commander (replied the Doctor) go your ways to <hi>Ioſeph</hi>'s Priſon, and ſay your Prayer over it with two Inclinations: if you ſay it in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, it will be ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

For this kind of Prayer is experienced, ready to be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62433:130"/>
heard and accepted: it is the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Neceſſity. I have known an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Egyptians</hi> make uſe of it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently.</q> 
               <hi>Caphor</hi> departed, and did what the Old man adviſed him, and God did the buſineſs for him within a week. The ancient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as well the Doctors, and they that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the knowledge of the ſayings and actions of the Prophet, as before them, thoſe of his company and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, have ever had recourſe to that noble Priſon, and there they called upon Almighty God for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of their affairs, and their prayers were heard. <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſpoke with God, and his Brother <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> (Gods peace be with them both) even they have made their Prayers there, and obtained Divine Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: for it is the Priſon wherein their Uncle <hi>Joſeph</hi> was detained; ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Son of <hi>Gamran,</hi> the Son of <hi>Iaheb,</hi> the Son of <hi>Levi,</hi> which <hi>Levi</hi> was <hi>Ioſeph</hi>'s Brother.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62433:131"/>
made his Prayer over <hi>Ioſeph</hi>'s Priſon, as a place purpoſely ſet aſide for the imploring of Gods mercy; to which the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> when they are viſited with ſterility and dearth, or perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or are diſquieted by reaſon of any affair, run preſently, and make their prayer there, which is certainly heard. <hi>Iacob</hi> (Gods peace be with him) added thereto the place of his She-Camel, where he made her kneel down that he might get off her back. <note place="margin">The place of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Camel.</note> Since the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Religion hath been obſerved, there is a Moſquey built in that place: it is under the Bank of Sand, upon which is the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

Many of thoſe who accompanied the Prophet entered into it; that is to ſay, the Fourſcore who were in <hi>Egypt</hi> at the time of the Conqueſts, the firſt whereof was <hi>Gamrou</hi> the Son of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> then his Son <hi>Gabdol,</hi> and <hi>Zebirus</hi> the Son of <hi>Gavam,</hi> and <hi>Abuharirus,</hi> and <hi>Abudar,</hi> and <hi>Mecdad,</hi> and the reſt, (Gods be with them all;) nay ſome of them left their Prints upon the Roof of the Priſon.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62433:135"/>
have the curioſity to go thither to ſee them, and to conſider the admirable ſtructure thereof; what therefore ought they to do who are here in the Country where they are, and ſo near them? My Father told me, that he had ſeen <hi>Magedolmelic Macherir</hi> the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Macherir</hi> the blind Man.</note> blind man, who got the <hi>Alcoran</hi> read to him at the gate of the Weſtern Caſtle, Gods mercy on him, in the time of the Prelate <hi>Muſt aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libemrillus,</hi> who had ſeen him; I ſay, at theſe <hi>Pyramids,</hi> attended by an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian</hi> Youth, who led him by the hand, and that the Youth having brought him upon the <hi>Pyramid</hi> which lies Eaſtward, he felt the graving of it with his hand, and what was written upon it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd it, praiſing and giving thanks to God continually for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he had inſpir'd his ſervants withall, and the excellency of their workmanſhip and <hi>Geometry.</hi> My Father ſaluted him, and ſpoke thus to him; O Lord, you put your ſelf to much trouble, and take a great deal of pains to get up and down this Pyramid. O Brother, reply'd he, to travel up and down the Country,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62433:136"/>
and to conſider the tracks of ancient Nations, and paſt ages, is one of thoſe things which are recomended to us, that thoſe who want examples may thereby find ſome for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and that the ſloathful and ſleepy may therein meet with what may awake them out of their ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and oblige them to conſider the Kingdom of the Heavens and the Earth, and the Miracles, and prodigious things which God hath placed therein. Theſe Pyramids are one of the moſt miraculous things of any in <hi>Egypt,</hi> after the <hi>Nile.</hi> For as to the <hi>Nile,</hi> its flowings and eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings depend on a wiſedom known only to him who gives it its courſe, and obliges it to do its duty; who commands it to encreaſe, and it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys; and who cauſes it to fall, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath acquitted it ſelf of what people needed from it. What is there more admirable then theſe prodigies? For my part, I am a poor man, who have loſt my fight, and whoſe curioſity can reach only thoſe miracles and rarities, which may be learnt by the ear. But who comes it, that thoſe who ſee well,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62433:136"/>
who have leaſure, and live near theſe miracles, have not the curioſity to divert themſelves in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof?</q> He thereupon took me by the hand, and recited theſe verſes to me. <hi>Pray unto him who hath liv'd upon the Mount, to dictate unto thee the Hiſtory of himſelf, and cauſe him not to weep, unleſs it be with my tears. I cannot ſee remote countries with my eyes, but it may be I ſhall ſee them by the means of my ears.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he fell a weeping, ſo that he made me weep alſo, and ſaid to me: <q>O Brother know that the ſighs of the poor blind man will never end in this world, and that they will not ceaſe, till he hath caſted death, and that God hath promiſ'd him, that if he patiently endure the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of his blindneſs, and loſs of his ſight, and ſhall have taken it as coming from God, and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted it, he will juſtifie him, and bring him into Paradiſe. For the blind man is dead among the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. The Law of God commands a man to ſalute him; it is an act of faith, to eat with him; it is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, to ſit down with
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62433:137"/>
him; 'tis a merit of reward to diſcourſe with him; 'tis a thing of obligation to give him an almes; he who takes him by the hand in his neceſſity obtains the remiſſion of his ſins. Then he ſaid further to me: Know that what oblig'd me to take the pains to come to this place, was ſomewhat told me by a certain Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar while we were together in the Colledge.</q> 'Twas of his father that he ſpoke to me, and he was of that Country of <hi>Gize.</hi> My father, ſaid he, told me, that while he was a young man, he went and came many times night and day by theſe Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids, his affairs obliging him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and that he and ſome other young men about his age went up on the top of them, and ſometimes into them, without any other deſign then to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert themſelves. One day among others, ſaid this father to his ſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he added, about noon being mounted on a beaſt which I had, as I kept along my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way, paſſing near theſe Pyramids, I ſaw a company of <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome on Horſes, and others on Camels, and ſome people a foot
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62433:137"/>
marching along with them, as it were in a Proceſſion about the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids. Whereupon thought I to to my ſelf, Who are thoſe that make a Proceſſion about the Pyramids now at noon? Is it not for ſome accident newly happen'd in the City? I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made towards them, ſo that I came pretty near them, and look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them very earneſtly. But I found, as I view'd them at a nearer diſtance, that they had neither the ſtature nor meen of ordinary men, and I made the ſame judgement of their Horſes and their Camels. Which oblig'd me to recommend my ſelf to God, after which I ſaluted them, and they return'd my ſalutation, and ſpoke thus to me; <q>Be of good courage, thou ſhalt have no harm. We are a company of <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Doemons.</note> number of the <hi>Doemons,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God and in his Prophet. When the <hi>Doemons</hi> return a mans ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, he may believe himſelf ſafe enough as to them. When therefore thou ſhalt meet with creatures which thou thinkeſt not to be men, ſalute them, for if they
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62433:138"/>
ſalute thee again, they will be faithful, if they do not return thy ſalutation, they will not be faithful; it will therefore concern thee to recommend thy ſelf to God, that he may preſerve thee from them; for by that means it will not be in their power to hurt thee.</q> After that I ſaw among them a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> whom they honoured much, and whom they acknowledg'd as it were for their Protector and Superiour, to whom one of them ſpoke thus. See you the beauty and the excellency, and the workmanſhip of that Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and of that Architecture, the <note place="margin">The Piramids.</note> ſolidity of thoſe buildings, and the goodneſs of their ſituation? This, reply'd he, is an effect of their wiſdom, who inhabited the land before us, who were mightier then we, and fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd themſelves, by more noble marks, then we can do, upon the earth. I had heard what the ancients ſaid of theſe Pyramids, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee and conſider them my ſelf before my death, ſhould we now at the time we live in, attempt the making of ſuch works as theſe, we ſhould not compaſs them, even though
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62433:138"/>
men joyn'd with us to carry on the work. Nay, though we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with the building of but one Pyramid, we ſhould not be able to do it; what pain therefore would it be to make as many as there are here? After that they departed as it were in order to their return, and one of them bid me <hi>Adieu,</hi> and ſpoke thus to me; <q>O man, endeavour to forbear walking abroad at noon; rather ſleep at mid-day, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils do not ſleep at that time.</q> Now this is it that obliged me to come to theſe Pyramids, which are ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Workmanſhip, that the Doemons themſelves cannot make the like. Why ſhall I not feel them at leaſt with my hand? Beſides, here is a Youth who repreſents things ſo well to me, that I comprehend them as if I ſaw them my ſelf: I thank God who guides my Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo well.</p>
            <p>We find in the Book of the Lives of great and illuſtrious perſons, who have flouriſhed in ſeveral times, that <hi>Maſre</hi> (God preſerve it) was anciently called <hi>Babelain,</hi> and that that name <note place="margin">Babelain.</note> had been given it in regard that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:62433:139"/>
being heretofore the ſeat of the Empire of <hi>Gueraca</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> when the Kingdom of <hi>Maſre</hi> came to be great and famous in the world the <hi>Coptites</hi> called it <hi>Babelain,</hi> pretending by that name to raiſe the luſtre of its State, and to exalt the glory and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of its Empire: as if they would ſay, the ancient <hi>Babel</hi> was but one <hi>Babel,</hi> and that <hi>Maſre</hi> was <hi>Babelain,</hi> that is to ſay, two <hi>Babels.</hi> Whence it came, that after the <hi>Romans</hi> got to be Maſters of <hi>Syria,</hi> they ſaid the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> is <hi>Babylon,</hi> and made <note place="margin">Babylon.</note> great account of that Province by reaſon of the conveniences they had thence by Sea and by Land; ſo that that name continued to it. Then upon its being taken by the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Omar,</hi> (Gods peace be with him) by the conduct of <hi>Gamrou</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus,</hi> (Gods mercy on him) an <hi>Arabian</hi> Poet made Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherein he acknowledged the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour God had done them in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and the abundance and variety of good things and wealth which they had acquired by that victory. The ſubject of thoſe Verſes was, that <note place="margin">

Children of <hi>Som,</hi> (Gods mercy on him) came from <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Maſre</hi> with <hi>Gamron</hi> the Son of <hi>Gaſus,</hi> and entered into it with 100 men of his Nation, bringing their equipage on horſes; which men he commanded, having belonging to him 50 Servants and 30 Horſes. <hi>Gamrou</hi> and the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> being afterwards reſolved to beſiege the Caſtle, <hi>Quiſias</hi> choſe a place where he and his men might continue, and cauſed his Tent to be pitched there, according to the relation of <hi>Abugam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou Mahumet</hi> the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and aboad there during the whole Siege of the Caſtle, till God brought it into their power. After that <hi>Quiſias</hi> was with <hi>Gamrou</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> leaving his people and his baggage in that place; and after <hi>Alexandria</hi> had alſo been taken by the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> as <hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou</hi> was returning to <hi>Maſre,</hi> having impoſed on the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute they were to pay, and ſigned the Articles of their Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Quiſias</hi> returned alſo to his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at <hi>Maſre,</hi> and lodg'd there ſtill. The <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> marked Lodgings for themſelves, and <hi>Gamrou</hi> cauſed his own to be marked oppoſite to that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62433:140"/>
heap of Sand where <hi>Quiſias</hi> had taken up his Poſt. Then the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> had a Council about the building of a Moſquey, where they might meet together, and writ concerning it to the Commander of the Faithful, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> (Gods peace be with him) who returned this anſwer; <q>I have received the news of the reſolution which you have taken up all together for the building of a Moſquey, where you may celebrate the Friday, and make your Aſſemblies. It is no doubt athing neceſſary for you, and you follow in that the example of your Prophet, Gods peace and mercy be upon him. For the firſt mark whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſignalize the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the firſt foundation upon which he would ſettle it, was the building of his own Moſquey in the place of his Retreat. Aſſemble therefore hereupon your Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and take counſel of your anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who are Companions of the Apoſtle of God, Gods peace and mercy be with them, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, of God is in the Ancients.

and oppoſe it not. For the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Council brings the mercy of God, who protects that Nation, out of the kindneſs he hath for his Prophet, Gods peace and mercy be with him. Through the grace and mercy of God, they will never agree about a thing wherein there is any errour.

                  <hi>O Abugabdorracha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> I will take up a lodging for you inſtead of this, where you pleaſe to have it. Whereupon <hi>Quiſias</hi> ſpoke thus: I have already told you, O ye <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> who are hear aſſembled, that this habitation plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes me well, and that it is mine, but I beſtow it with all my heart on

               </q> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quitted that place, and lodg'd with thoſe of his Nation, who were the children of <hi>Som,</hi> and took up his Quarters among them.

ancient great Moſquey of that City; <hi>Our Moſquey was only Gardens and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards.

Our Moſquey was founded by four
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62433:142"/>
of the Companions of the Prophet, Gods peace and mercy be with them, <hi>Abudar, Abunaſre, Mahumet</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gerou</hi> the <hi>Zebirian,</hi> and <hi>Manbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he</hi> the ſon of <hi>Derar. Gabidol</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gegafur</hi> ſpeaks thus of it in theſe terms: Our Temple was raiſed by <hi>Guebad,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Samet,</hi> and by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecus,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Malichus,</hi> who were two Captains of the Protectors, Gods mercy on them. <hi>Abudaoud</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Gamrou,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus,</hi> ſent <hi>Rabigas</hi> the ſon of <hi>Sergil,</hi> and the ſon of <hi>Galcamas</hi> the <hi>Carſian,</hi> the <hi>Guedavian,</hi> to determine on which ſide ſhould be the Front of the Moſquey, and that he ſpoke thus to them. <q>Go you and ſtand on the top of the <note place="margin">The front of the <hi>Moſquey.</hi>

I pray God to aſſiſt you in the doing of it.</q> They did what he had commanded them. I have heard, ſays <hi>Lithus,</hi> (Gods mercy on him) that <hi>Gamrou</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus</hi> went up to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62433:142"/>
the Mountains, and exactly obſerved the time, and the ſhade of the Sun ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, till the ſide on which the front of the Temple ſhould be turn'd was agreed upon. <hi>Guemarus</hi> related to me, that he had heard his Father ſay, that <hi>Gamrou</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus</hi> ſaid to his Companions, Turn the front of the Moſquey towards the Eaſt, that it may be right oppoſite to <hi>Meca.</hi> It was turned (ſaid he) very much towards the Eaſt; but after that <hi>Corras</hi> the ſon of <hi>Coris</hi> made it incline a little toward the South. I have heard (ſaith <hi>Maſgab)</hi> the ſon of <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebib,</hi> who ſpoke thus upon theſe words of the All-mighty and All-good God, <hi>We ſhall ſee on which ſide thou wilt turn thy Face towards the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and we ſhall appoint thee a Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which thou ſhalt be pleaſed withall.</hi> This Situation (ſaith <hi>Jezidus)</hi> which the Apoſtle of God (Gods peace and mercy be with him) obſerved in his Prayers, and which All-mighty God commanded him to comply withall, conſiſted in having the face turned towards the Chanel; and it is the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Weſtern parts. I
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62433:143"/>
have heard the ſame <hi>Abuchebib,</hi> added <hi>Maſgab,</hi> read that paſſage after another manner, putting the firſt perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the ſecond, thus; <hi>And we will appoint thee a Situation, which we ſhall be pleaſed withall.</hi> One of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſaith, that <hi>Gabriel</hi> came to the Apoſtle of God (Gods peace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be with him) and ſaid unto him; Diſpoſe the Situation of thy Moſquey ſo as thou maiſt have thy face turned towards the ſquare Temple. Then he made his draughts upon all the Mountains which were between him and the ſquare Temple, and ſo he drew the Plat-form of his Moſquey, having his face turned towards the ſquare Temple, which happen'd to be the Chanel ſide. <hi>Malicus</hi> affirms that the Front of the Moſquey of the Prophet of God (Gods peace and mercy be with him) is Situated op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Chanel. Several Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors relate, that in the Moſquey of <hi>Gamrou,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus,</hi> there was no vaulted Upper-room, nor in that built by <hi>Muſlemas,</hi> nor in that built by <hi>Gabdolgueziz,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Merouan;</hi> and that the firſt who made an Upper-arched room was <hi>Corras,</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:62433:143"/>
the ſon of <hi>Maſquin.</hi> They ſay the ſon of <hi>Serich</hi> ſpeaks thus of it: In the great Moſquey, which <hi>Gamrou</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus</hi> built; there was no Arch, that is, no Arched Upper-room. <hi>Saguidus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Serich</hi> ſpeaks alſo of it in theſe terms; <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaguid</hi> related this to me. The <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirian,</hi> who is the moſt aged of thoſe whom I have met, ſaid to them: I have found this Moſquey where you aſſemble your ſelves, and which was built by <hi>Gamrou,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus,</hi> fifty Cubits in length, and thirty in breadth. <hi>Gamer</hi> the ſon of <hi>Omar,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Chebib,</hi> the Crier, ſpeaks thus of it; <hi>Gamrou</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus</hi> ſpoke to us, and made a Street which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Moſquey on all ſides; then he made two Gates oppoſite to the Houſe of <hi>Gamrou,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus,</hi> and two Gates on the Eaſt ſide, and two Gates on the Weſt ſide, ſo that when the people went out of the little Street of the <hi>Lampe,</hi> they found the Eaſt-corner of the Moſquey oppoſite to the Weſt-corner of the Houſe of <hi>Gamrou,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus;</hi> and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had taken out of <hi>Gamrou</hi>'s Houſe, what was ſince taken out.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62433:144"/>
The length of the Moſquey, from the front to the oppoſite end was equal to the length of <hi>Gamrou</hi>'s Houſe. The Roof on the outſide was very flat. In Summer the people ſate all about in the ſpacious place which was at the entrance. <hi>Abuſalich</hi> ſpeaks thus of it; <hi>Lithus</hi> ſaid to me one day, can you tell what diſtance there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Moſquey built by <hi>Gamrou,</hi> and his Houſe? No, ſaid I. Our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients told me (reply'd he) that there were ſeven Cubits, and that before they took out of <hi>Gamrou</hi>'s Houſe, what was ſince taken, and made part of the Moſquey. This ſhews that the Eaſtern Gate was oppoſite to the great Houſe of <hi>Gamrou.</hi> The ſon of <hi>Lahig</hi> relates it to us as a thing he had learnt of the ſon of <hi>Habir,</hi> that <hi>Abute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> the <hi>Chiſanian,</hi> had ſaid to him, that he had heard <hi>Gamrou</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gaſus</hi> ſpeaking in theſe terms: One of the Companions of the Apoſtle of God (Gods peace and mercy be with him) told me he had heard the Prophet, (Gods peace and mercy be with him) ſpeak thus; <q>The All-mighty and All-good God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you one Prayer beſides the

               <hi>Abunaſre</hi> the <hi>Gopharian</hi> related it, and <hi>Abutemim</hi> ſpeaks of it thus; As we ſate down together, <hi>Abudar</hi> and I, <hi>Abudar</hi> took me by the hand, and we went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Abunaſre,</hi> whom we met at the Gate, which is on the ſide of <hi>Gamrou</hi>'s Houſe, where <hi>Abudar</hi> ſpoke to him thus; O <hi>Abunaſre,</hi> have you heard the Apoſtle of God (Gods peace and mercy be with him) ſpeak in theſe terms? God hath yet enjoined you a Prayer; ſay it in the intervall between the Evening and betimes in the Morning. He repeated this to him three times, and he always an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Yea. <hi>Jachi</hi> the ſon of <hi>Salich,</hi> relates what follows, as having it from <hi>Gadras,</hi> who had it from his Father, and he from <hi>Gamer</hi> the ſon of <hi>Omar. Muſlemas</hi> (ſaid he) cauſed to be made in the great Moſquey, four Chappels at the four corners of it; For he firſt put them there, and they were not there before.

ſon of <hi>Merouam,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Chacam,</hi> cauſed ſomewhat to be done therein, according to the relation of <hi>Gamer,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Omar,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Chebib,</hi> the <hi>Raguinian,</hi> who affirms that <hi>Gab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolgueziz,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Merouan</hi> quite de-Demoliſh'd the great Moſquey, and that he augmented it on the Weſt-ſide, ſo that he left between it and the Houſe of <hi>Sand,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Gerou</hi>'s Son, and the others, but a ſmall Street, which is now called the <hi>Pav'd Street,</hi> and brought into it the ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place, which was on the North-ſide; but on the Eaſt-ſide he had no place to enlarge it.

They ſay there is not in the World any one handſomer and nobler then this, after the Seat of the Prophet of God, Gods peace and mercy be with him. After that, there were enlargements made by <hi>Salich,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gali,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gabdol,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Guebas,</hi> upon the account of the Commander of the Faithful <hi>Abulgue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi>

who added behind the Moſquey four Pillars.

place, that the Moſquey was ſquare. He added thereto alſo a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which is that on the South-ſide.

alone, without Aſſociate. He gives Life and Death, and he can do all things. 'Tis he who hath ſent his Apoſtle with good conduct, and the true Religion; and the reſt of the Verſe.

aſſiſt him to govern well what he hath under his juriſdiction of thy Servants, and of thy Provinces, by making him thy Lieutenant; and cauſe his Subjects to enjoy the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of good conduct in ſafety and aſſurance. He who had the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight of the Structure was <hi>Corras</hi> the ſon of <hi>Serich;</hi> and the time wherein it was finiſhed, is the Moneth <hi>Ramadan,</hi> in the ninety ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year of the Bleſſed Retreat.</q> I have heard <hi>Abugamrou</hi> ſpeak thus: The firſt who made Arched Upper-rooms was <hi>Omar,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gabdol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueziz,</hi> (Gods peace and mercy be with him) in the hundreth year; and the Moſqueys were made in that manner after him, having been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely without any ſuch Room. The firſt of the Prelates who cauſed the Benediction and the glorification of the Name of God to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Criers after him, was the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of <hi>Chaſina,</hi> whoſe Son is now known under the name of the Son of <hi>Gali</hi> the Prelate. Before that, the Prelates only pronounced that Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the People. I have heard him ſpeak in theſe terms: Theſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62433:148"/>
Pillars of Wood which are in the Court, were erected the ſame year that the Chanel was made. Before that the Veils were in the midſt of the Seeling of the great Moſquey. 'Tis related that in the Reign of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi> there were Coffers in the great Moſquey, wherein was put what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of the portions of the Poor and Indigent, of what they gather'd who walked up and down the High-ways, of all the other Collections which were made. Theſe Coffers or Cheſts were opened on the <hi>Friday,</hi> and they call'd with a loud voice ſuch as would accept of thoſe Alms; but it ſeldom happened that any came to receive them. Then they call'd him who had gathered them, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in theſe terms; The Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are come into the Coffers, they ſhall never return to me; I leave them to the All-mighty and All-good God. The <hi>Nilometer</hi> was built of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of theſe Almes; there being not any would receive them in the time of the <hi>Mamunus,</hi> Gods mercy on him. One of the Grandees of <hi>Egypt</hi> (God ſhew him mercy) related to me, that heretofore in the <hi>Lampe-</hi>ſtreet in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62433:149"/>
               <hi>Maſre,</hi> on the Feſtival day, after the great Feaſt of the Moneth <hi>Ramadan,</hi> they ſet Kettles full of Fleſh, and Baskets full of Bread, and that they called with a loud voice ſuch as had need thereof, as they call people to Water on the High-ways; and that it happened ſometimes the greateſt part remained there all Night upon the place, ſo few would take of it. The remainder was carried to the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and they anſwered, we have enough to live upon, thanks be to God. The Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> was then the moſt plentiful of any in the world, the moſt Populous, and the beſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and where there was more convenience of Habitation and Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The <hi>Maſich</hi> relates in his Annals, and others affirm alſo, that the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> when they ſaw the <hi>Nile</hi> at the higheſt, gave Almes, releaſed Slaves, cloath'd Orphans, relieved Widows, and ſuch as were deſtitute of Succour, out of their thankfulneſs to God, for the kindneſs he did them in raiſing the courſe of the <hi>Nile</hi> to its height.</p>
            <p>They relate that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> after he <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pharao</hi>'s Caſtle.</note> grew Proud, and Inſolent, and Impious,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62433:149"/>
commanded a Caſtle to be built on the deſcent of Mount <hi>Mactam;</hi> and that his Viſier <hi>Haman,</hi> according to this order, got workmen together from all parts of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo that there were a hundred and fifty thouſand Architects, with what Trades-men, Handy-craftsmen, and Labourers were requiſite. He cauſed Brick and Mortar to be made, Timber to be felled, and Nails to be made; then they began their Building, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it ſo high, that never any had done the like before; for the Maſons were no longer able to ſtand on their Feet to work. But the All-mighty and All-good God about Sun-ſet ſent <hi>Gabriel</hi> (Gods peace be with him) who ſmote the Caſtle with his Wing, and cleft it into three pieces, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of fell on <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Army, where it kill'd a thouſand Men; another fell into the Sea, and appeared there like a high Mountain; and the third fell into the Weſtern Land. There was not ſo much as one of the <hi>Coptites</hi> who wrought within it ſaved, they all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſh'd. They relate that thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was ſo proud, as to caſt an Arrow at Heaven; God willing to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62433:150"/>
try him, returned his Arrow to him all bloody; Whereupon he cry'd out, I have killed <hi>Moſes</hi>'s God. God is infinitely above what impious men can do; he does what he pleaſes with his Servants. God therefore at that very time ſent <hi>Gabriel,</hi> who did to the Caſtle as we have related.</p>
            <p>One of thoſe who were impious, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caron</hi> the Wealthy, who is <hi>Corah.</hi>
               </note> and proud, and arrogant in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was <hi>Caron</hi> the Cup-bearer; He was an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> Couſin-german to <hi>Moſes,</hi> (Gods peace be with him) for <hi>Caron</hi> was the ſon of <hi>Jaſhar,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Caheb,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> was the ſon of <hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Caheb.</hi> Others ſay <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>Caron</hi>'s Siſters ſon; he was called <hi>Caron</hi> the Bright, by reaſon of the beauty of his Face. He was the moſt diligent of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the reading of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, but he became a Hypocrite, as the <hi>Samerian</hi> was, and ſaid; <q>Since the Prophecy belonged to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Sacrifice, and the Oblation, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law to <hi>Aaron,</hi> what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains there for me?</q> They relate that <hi>Moſes</hi> having brought the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Sea, gave <hi>Caron</hi> a Commiſſion to interpret the Law,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62433:150"/>
and to collect the Offerings, and made him one of the Chiefs. The Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings belonged then to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but he beſtowed them on his Brother, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Caron</hi> was troubled, and envy'd them both, and ſpoke thus to them; <q>Behold now the command is come abſolutly into your hands, and I have nothing to do with the affairs of the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> How long ſhall I ſuffer this? It is God, reply'd <hi>Moſes,</hi> who thus diſpoſes of things. I will not believe it, reply'd <hi>Caron,</hi> if you do not confirm it to me by a Miracle.</q> Then <hi>Moſes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to come all to him, every one with his Rod; then he ty'd all thoſe Rods together, and caſt them into the Tent, where God ordinarily revealed his Will to him. They kept a Guard about the Rods all night, and the next morning they found <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod ſhaking with the Wind, covered all over with green Leaves. That Rod was made of a Branch of Almond-trees. <q>This is no more miraculous (ſaid <hi>Caron)</hi> then what the Magicians daily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</q> He became thence forward more impious then before, more
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62433:151"/>
wicked, more envious, and more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as God affirms in his Book, when he ſaith, Caron <hi>was of the People of</hi> Moſes, <hi>but he was unjuſt towards them.</hi> Injuſtice here ſignifies a perſecution without any cauſe, and a malicious and irrational Diſpute. Others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that <hi>Pharao</hi> appointed <hi>Caron</hi> to govern the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that he treated them injuriouſly and tyrannically. Tyranny (they ſay) proceeds from greatneſs, that is, from the eminence and advantage which any one hath over others. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he had over them was grounded on his great Wealth, and the multitude of his children. He made (ſay they) his Garments larger by a ſpan then theirs; His Keys (ſay they) that is the Keys of his Store-houſes, were carried by ſixty Mules; Evere Store-houſe had its Key, and every Key was but a Finger long; they were of Leather. Some affirm, expounding that paſſage of the Book of the All-mighty and All-good God, where it is ſaid of him, <hi>I have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, but according to the knowledge which is within me;</hi> that he was the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62433:151"/>
beſt skilled of his time in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> On the contrary, others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm he was skilled in Chemiſtry; <hi>Saguid</hi> the ſon of <hi>Muſib</hi> ſays, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had the Science of <hi>Chemiſtry,</hi> and <note place="margin">Chemiſtry.</note> that he taught a third purt of it to <hi>Joſuah,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nun,</hi> a third to <hi>Caleb,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jethnas,</hi> and a third to <hi>Caron,</hi> but that <hi>Caron</hi> ſerved the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two ſo well, that he learnt the whole Science from them both, and that afterwards he took Lead and Copper, and changed it into pure Gold. Others affirm that <hi>Moſes</hi> taught his Siſter Chemiſtry, inaſmuch as his Devotion made him deſpiſe Gold, and that his Siſter taught it <hi>Caron,</hi> who was her Husband. They relate that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, it was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the life of this World, and that he had no need thereof, becauſe it was a periſhable thing, and far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the truth, which is All-mighty God, and that he quitted what was periſhable, which his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion permitted him not to deſire, and ſatisfy'd himſelf with what was neer All-mighty God. They ſay that <hi>Caron</hi> went abroad one day on a white Mule he had, covered with a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62433:152"/>
Foot-cloth of Purple, and a Golden Saddle, accompany'd by four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand young Men, and three hundred beautiful young Maids, clad in Silk, and ſet out with Jewels and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of great value, and divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; ſo that he had marching on his right hand three hundred young men, and on his left three hundred young maids. Others ſay he went abroad on Horſe-back attended by ninety thouſand Servants Men and Maids, who belonged to him, young men and young maids all Marriageable. They relate that he gave very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful words to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> priding himſelf in his great Wealth, <hi>Moſes</hi> taking much at his hands for Kindred ſake, and not willing to be incenſed againſt him, till the Ordinance for the payment of Tiths came down. Then <hi>Moſes</hi> made an Agreement with <hi>Caron,</hi> that of a thouſand Crowns of Gold he ſhould pay one, and of a thouſand Drachmes one. But his Soul grew the more Covetous, by reaſon of the great quantity of Gold and Silver which he had, after he had counted it, and found ſo much. He thereupon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62433:152"/>
the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make Speeches to them, and ſpoke to them in theſe terms; <q>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> has hitherto dealt with you as he pleaſed himſelf, and now he would take away your goods. You are our Lord and Maſter (reply'd they) command us to do what you think good. We muſt (ſaid he) corrupt ſuch a one, naming a woman of a lewd life, and induce her to calu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mniate <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo as that he may be ſuſpected to have had ſome dealings with her, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> may be put out of the good opinion they have of him, and have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion for him, and at laſt quite forſake him.</q> They promiſed that debauch'd woman a 1000. Crowne of gold; others ſay a Baſin full of gold. Then the day of one of their Feſtivals being come, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood up to ſpeak to them; and after he had praiſed God, and given thanks, he ſpoke thus; <q>O ye Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God commands you &amp; me alſo, that if any one among us be a Thief, we ſhould put him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from us; if any one commit Fornication, and be not married, we ſhould puniſh him with the Whip,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62433:153"/>
and if he be married, we ſhould ſtone him. And if you your ſelf have committed thoſe crimes, O <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Caron.</hi> Yes, reply'd <hi>Moſes,</hi> though it were my ſelf.

               <hi>Moſes</hi> having heard theſe words ſent for the woman, and charged her by him who had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Sea, and ſent the Law from Heaven, to declare the truth. Then God of his mercy, touched the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans heart, and ſhe ſpoke thus: <q>By the true God, thoſe who ſay it ſpeak an untruth; but true it is, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> and his people have promiſed me a reward if I teſtify'd that you had ſinned with me, O great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who have ſpoken to God.</q> Then <hi>Moſes</hi> fell down to the ground, and worſhipped God weeping, and made this Prayer to him; <q>O Lord, if I am thy Apoſtle, avenge me, for it is impoſſible for me to endure thoſe who have not thy fear before their eyes. And God revealed his will to him, ſpeaking thus: Command the Earth to do what thou deſireſt,

and by my permiſſion it ſhall obey thee.</q> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> lift up his head, and ſaid to the people; <q>O ye Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God hath ſent me to <hi>Caron</hi> as he ſent me to <hi>Pharao;</hi> let ſuch of you as are of his party ſtand near him.</q> They all withdrew from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> ſave onely two men, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued obſtinate in their wrath, their impoſture, and their malice.

Then <hi>Caron</hi> and his two Companions began to entreat <hi>Moſes</hi> to be merciful to them; but <hi>Moſes</hi> made no account of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for he was too much incenſed. On the contrary he pronounced the third time the ſame words, <q>O Earth take them, and detain them in thy Bowels till the day of Judgment.</q> Then the Earth ſwallow'd them up quite, and cloſed over their Heads. Then ſaid God to <hi>Moſes:</hi> 
               <q>O <hi>Moſes,</hi> thou art very inhumane, my Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures implored thy mercy ſeveral times, and thou haſt not had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion

               <hi>Moſes</hi> hearing of this was angry at it, and prayed to God that the Houſe of <hi>Caron</hi> and all his goods might be ſwallowed into the bottom of the Earth. The All-migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and All-good God teſtifies it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he ſpeaks thus; <hi>And we have made him and his Houſe to deſcend into the Bowels of the Earth;</hi> he means Caron: and <hi>no man can relieve him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and he was not of thoſe who are relieved.</hi>

They are ſeen ſearching into the Earth, and turning up ſo much of it as hath been overflown, and caſting into it all ſorts of Grain, which they hope (with the aſſiſtance of God) will multiply therein.

ride or the Camel, and have Shoes on; he ſhall carry the</hi> Arabian <hi>Bow, and have a Turbant on his Head:</hi> Gods peace and mercy be with him. When <hi>Gamrou</hi> came to <hi>Egypt</hi> to conquer it, he and the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> (Gods peace be with them) the <hi>Romans</hi> perceiving they would certainly be ſubdued, and not doubting of the Victory of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> hid that Statue under ground, that it might not ſerve the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> for an Argument againſt them in the diſpute.

to the <hi>Romans,</hi> a Statue of Stone in the form of an Aſs, with a man upon it, ſet on a ſquare Pedeſtal, ſo that the Statue and the Pedeſtal were all of a piece, of a black bright ſtone; and all who entered into the Church, or came out of it, did ſpit upon the Statue, and railed at it, then turned away from it. I ask'd the King (continued the <hi>Sagadian</hi> as he related this ſtory) as I ſate with him, what figure that was, and he told me that the <hi>Romans</hi> thought it a Statue of the Prince of the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (added he) I felt my ſelf ſmitten with the Zeal of the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which obliged me to ſpeak thus to him; <q>Certainly great King, this people is ill informed of that Statue, and the opinion they have of it far from any likelihood of truth. Why? ſaid the King. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaid I) he whom they imagine it repreſent, never rid but upon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels; on the contrary, 'tis the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> (Gods peace be with him) who rode on an Aſs. The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſent for a company of Prieſts and Monks, and related my diſcours to them, and they doubted not but
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:62433:160"/>
that I had reaſon, and ſpoke the truth, which made them preſently conſider what they ſhould do with that Figure. The reſult was, that ere next day was over, they prepared it a Chappel, where they lodg'd it in the Church, afterwards burning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe before it, and cloathing it with Silk, and making a Proceſſion about it, and doing it great honours with much Devotion. This was a buſineſs (ſaid they) which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from us.

No, by the true God, ſaid the Sultan, on the the contrary, you have done well, and deſerved reward; ſince what you did was out of the good zeal you had for the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Religion, and the ſervice of the Prophet, Gods peace and mercy be with him.
