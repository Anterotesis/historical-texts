         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

my chance (amongst other talke which was generally trauersed
amongst vs) to mooue diuers Questions, as touching the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
qualities required in <hi>Castalions</hi> Courtier: one came in with
that of <hi>Ouid, Semper amabilis esto,</hi> another stood more stricktly
on the necessitie of that affabilitie, which our Latinists entitle
<hi>fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tius,</hi> &amp; we more familiarlie describe by the name of discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
the third came in with his carpet deuises, and tolde what
it was to tickle a Citterne, or haue a sweete stroke on the Lute,
to daunce more delicatlie, and reuell it brauelie. The fourth as
an enemie to their faction, confuted all these as effeminate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and would needes maintaine, that the onely adiuncts of a
Courtier, were schollership and courage, returning picked cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie
to paultry Scriueners and such like, affabilitie to <hi>Aristip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>
and his crue, Citterning and Luting, to the birthright of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
sixe pennie slaue, and to conclude, dauncing &amp; reuelling,
to euerie Taylors holie day humour. But as for those two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of honor before mencioned, they distinguish a Gentleman
from a broking Iacke, and a Courtier from a clubheaded com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.
This discourse thus continued, at length they fell by a
iarring gradation, to the particuler demonstrations of theyr
generall assertions. One woulde haue one thing preferred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some one man was thereby aduaunced, another, another
thing, because some noble man loues it, euery man shotte his
bolte, but this was the vpshot, that England afforded many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrities,
but neuer saw any thing more singuler then worthy
Sir <hi>Phillip Sidney,</hi> of whom it might truely be saide, <hi>Arma vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque

complaints, the wounds wherof the former forepast feminine
sexe hath felt. I but here the <hi>Homer</hi> of Women hath forestal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an obiection, saying, that <hi>Mantuans</hi> house holding of our
Ladie, he was enforced by melancholie into such vehemencie of
speech, and that there be amongst them as amongst men, some
good, some badde, but then let vs heare what was the opinion
of ancient Philosophers, as touching the Femall sexe.</p>
            <p>One of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beeing asked what estate that was, which made
wise men fooles, and fooles wisemen, answered marriage. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
doth counsell vs, rather to gette a little wife then a
great, because alwaies a little euill is better then a great, so
that hee counted all women without exception, euill and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious.
Another of them béeing asked what was the greatest
miracle in the world, saide, a chaste woman. One requiring
<hi>Diogenes</hi> iudgment when it was best time to take a wife, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
for the young man not yet, and the olde man neuer.
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> sayd, that there were thrée euils not to be suffered,
fire, water, and a woman. And the forenamed <hi>Cinick</hi> déemed
them the wisest lyers in the world, which tell folke they will
be married, and yet remaine single, accounting it the lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience
of two extremities to choose the lesse. The selfe
same man affirmeth it to be the only means to escape all euils,
to eschew womens counsaile, and not to square our actions by
their direction. The olde Sages did admonish young men, if
euer they matcht wyth any wife, not to take a rich Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if she be rich, shee wyll not be content to be a wife, but
will be a Maister or Mistresse, in commaunding, chiding,
correcting &amp; controlling. Another Philosopher compared a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
richly apparelled, to a dunghill couered with grasse. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
deemed it the desperatest enterprise that one can take
in hand, to gouerne a womans will.</p>
            <p>What shall I say of him that béeing askt, from what women
a man should keepe himselfe, answered, from the quick &amp; from
the deade, adding moreouer, that one euill ioynes with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when a woman is sicke. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> saide, that it was
<pb facs="tcp:10619:6"/>
the greatest torment, that a man could inuent to his enemies
vexation, to giue him his daughter in marriage, as a domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Furie to disquiet him night and day. <hi>Democritus</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a faire chaste woman a miracle of miracles, a degrée of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
a crowne of tryumph, because shee is so harde to be
founde. Another beeing asked, who was he that coulde not at
any time be without a wife, answered, hee that was alwaies
accurst: and what dooth thys common prouerbe, he that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
late marrieth euill, insinuate vnto vs, but that if a man
meane to marry, he were as good, begin betimes as tarry long,
and béeing about to make a vertue of necessitie, and an arte of
patience, they are to beginne in theyr young and tender age.
Moreouer, amongst the thinges which change the nature and
conditions of men, women and wine are sette in the forefront,
as the chiefe causes of their calamitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his precepts of wedlocke, alleageth a reason
why men faile so often in choosing of a good wife, because saith
hee, the number of them is so small. There be two especiall
troubles in this worlde saith <hi>Seneca,</hi> a wife and ignoraunce.
<hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> compared women to shyps, because to keepe
them wel and in order, there is alwayes somewhat wanting:
and <hi>Plautus</hi> saith, that women decke themselues so gorgiously,
and lace themselues so nicely, because foule deformed things,
seeke to sette out themselues sooner, then those creatures that
are for beauty far more amiable. For my part I meane to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spende
my sentence, and to let an Author of late memorie be
my speaker, who affyrmeth that they carrie Angels in their
faces to entangle men and deuils in their deuices. <hi>Valerius in
Epist. ad Ruf.</hi> hath these words of womens trecherous works,
<hi>Amice ne longo dispendio te suspendam, lege aureolum Theophrasti,
&amp; Medeam Iasonis, &amp; vix pauca inuenies impossibilia mulieri, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice

least I should holde thee too long with too tedious a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce,

Iasons Medea, and thou shalt finde fewe things impossible for a
woman, My sweet friende, GOD Almightie graunt that thou
<pb facs="tcp:10619:7"/>
beest not entrapt by womens trecherie.</hi>
               </hi> Furthermore, in the
same place he saith, <hi>Quis muliebr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> garrulitati aliquid committit,
quae illud solum potest tacere quod nescit: <hi>who will commit any
thing to a womans tatling trust, who conceales nothing but
that shee knowes not.</hi>
               </hi> I omit to tell with what phrases of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
the ancient fathers haue defaced them, wherof one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
saith: <hi>Quid aliud est mulier nisi amicitiae inimica &amp;c. <hi>What is a
woman, but an enemie to friendshippe, an vneuitable paine, a
necessary euil, a naturall temptation, a desired calamitie, a dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
danger, a delectable detriment, the nature of the which is
euill shadowed with the coloure of goodnes. Therefore if to
put her a way be a sinne, to keepe her still must needes be a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </hi>
Another sayth: <hi>Illud aduerte quod extra paradisum vir
factus est &amp;c. <hi>Consider this, that man was made without Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
woman within Paradise, that thereby we may learne, that
euery one winneth not credit by the nobilitie of the place, or
of his stock, but by his vertue. Finally, man made better is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
without Paradise in a place inferior, and contrariwise, she which
was created in a better place, namely Paradise, is founde to be

               </hi> Another hath these words: <hi>Diligit mulier vt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Aut amat, aut odit mulier, nil tertium est, dediscere flere

there is no third thing: it is an vntruth to say, that a woman can

creatures, who also gaue thanks to Nature especiallie
for three things, whereof the first and cheefest was, that shee

to some other mechanicall Arte, that they might not thus be
the staine of Arte. Such kind of Poets were they that <hi>Plato</hi>
excluded from his Common wealth, and <hi>Augustine</hi> banished
<hi>ex ciuitate Dei,</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> derided, and the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>
scorned, who wold not suffer one of <hi>Archilocus</hi> bookes
to remaine in their Countrey, and amisse it were not, if these
which meddle with the Arte they knowe not, were bequethed
to Bridwell, there to learne a new occupation: sor as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siliske
with his hisse, driueth all other Serpents from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> place
of his aboad, so these rude Rithmours with their iarring verse,
allienate all mens mindes from delighting in numbers excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which they haue so defaced, that wee may well exclaime
with the Poet, <hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But least I should be mistaken as an enemie to Poetrie,
or at least not taken as a friend to that studie, I haue thought
good to make them priuie to my mind, by expressing my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
I account of Poetrie, as of a more hidden &amp; diuine kinde
<pb facs="tcp:10619:12"/>
of Philosophy, enwrapped in blinde Fables and darke stories,
wherin the principles of more excellent Arts and morrall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of manners, illustrated with diuers examples of other
Kingdomes and Countries are contained: for amongst the
<hi>Grecians</hi> there were Poets, before there were any Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
who embraced entirely the studie of wisedome, as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
testifieth in his <hi>Tusculanes,</hi> whereas he saith, that of all
sorts of men, Poets are most ancient, who to the intent they
might allure men with a greater longing to learning, haue fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
two things, sweetnes of verse, and variety of inuention,
knowing that delight doth prick men forward to the attaining
of knowledge, and that true things are rather admirde if they
be included in some wittie fiction, like to Pearles that delight
more if they be deeper sette in gold. Wherfore séeing Poetry
is the very same with Philosophy, the fables of Poets must of
necessitie be fraught with wisedome &amp; knowledge, as framed
of those men, which haue spent all their time and studies, in
the one and in the other. For euen as in Uines, the Grapes
that are fayrest and sweetest, are couched vnder the branches
that are broadest and biggest, euen so in Poems, the thinges
that are most profitable, are shrouded vnder the Fables that
are most obscure: neither is there almost any poeticall fyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein there is not some thing comprehended, taken
out either of Histories, or out of the Phisicks or Ethicks, wher
vpon <hi>Erasmus Roterdamus</hi> very wittilie termes Poetry, a
daintie dish seasoned with delights of euery kind of discipline.
Nowe whether ryming be Poetry, I referre to the iudgment
of the learned: yea let the indifferent Reader diuine, what
deepe misterie can be placed vnder plodding méeter. Who is
it, that reading Beuis of Hampton, can forbeare laughing, if
he marke what scambling shyft he makes to ende his verses a
like. I will propound three or foure payre by the way for the
Readers recreation.</p>
            <l>The Porter said, by my snout,</l>
            <l>It was Sir Beuis that I let out.</l>
            <l>or this,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:10619:13"/>He smote his sonne on the breast,</l>
            <l>That he neuer after spoke with Clark nor Priest.</l>
            <l>or this,</l>
            <l>This almes by my crowne,</l>
            <l>Giues she for Beuis of South-hamptoune.</l>
            <l>or this,</l>
            <l>Some lost a nose, some a lip,</l>
            <l>And the King of Scots hath a ship.</l>
            <p>But I let these passe as worne out absurdities, meaning
not at this instant to vrge (as I might) the like instance of
Authors of our time, least in laying foorth their nakednesse, I
might seeme to haue discouered my mallice, imitating <hi>Aiax,</hi>
who obiecting more irefully vnto <hi>Vlysses</hi> flattery, detected him
selfe of follie.</p>
            <p>As these men offend in the impudent publishing of witles
vanitie, so others ouershoote the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues as much another waie,
in sencelesse stoicall austeritie, accounting Poetrie impietie,
and witte follie. It is an old Question, and it hath beene often
propounded, whether it were better to haue moderate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or no affections? The <hi>Stoicks</hi> said none. The <hi>Peripatici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
answered to haue temperate affections, and in this respect
I am a professed <hi>Peripatician,</hi> mixing profit with pleasure, and
precepts of doctrine with delightfull inuention. Yet these men
condemne them of lasciuiousnes, vanitie, and curiositie, who
vnder fayned Stories include many profitable morrall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
describing the outrage of vnbridled youth, hauing the
reine in their owne hands: the fruits of idlenes, the of-spring
of lust, and how auaileable good educations are vnto vertue.
In which their preciser censure, they resemble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the nutte for mislike of the shell, &amp; are like to those which
loath the fruite for the leaues, accounting the one sower, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other is bitter. It may be some dreaming dunce whose
bald affected eloquence making his function odious, better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séeming
a priuie then a pulpit, a misterming Clowne in a
Comedy, then a chosen man in the Ministerie, will cry out
<pb facs="tcp:10619:13"/>
that it bréedes a scabbe to the conscience, to peruse such Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
béeing indeed the display of their duncerie, and bréeding
a mislike of such tedious dolts barbarisme, by the view of their
rethoricall inuention. Such trifling studies say they infect the
minde and corrupt the manners, as though the minde were
only conuersant in such toies, or shold continuallie stay where
the thoughts by chaunce doo stray. The Sunne beames touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the earth, remaine still from whence they came, so a wyse
mans mind, although sometimes by chance it wandereth here
and there, yet it hath recourse in staied yéeres to that it ought.
But graunt the matter to be fabulous, is it therfore friuolous?
Is there not vnder Fables, euen as vnder the shaddowe of
greene and florishing leaues, most pleasant fruite hidden in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,
and a further meaning closely comprised? Did not <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill</hi>

perrished, and this second sort of men which now are, be of a
newe creation, growing into such a multitude by <hi>Deucalion</hi>
and <hi>Pirrhas</hi> meanes. As touching the men of the first worlde,
thus much (saith he) is committed to memorie, that when as
they began to be puft vppe with pride of their prosperitie, they
enterprised all iniquitie priuiledged by impunitie, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding

a disgrace to youth, to embrace the studies of age, counting
their fathers fooles whiles they striue to make them wise, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
that away at a cast at dice, which cost theyr daddes a
yeares toyle, spending that in their Ueluets, which was rakt

their rents raised to the vttermost, is scarce inough to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ones rufling pride, which was wont to be manie poore
mens relife. These young Gallants hauing leudly spent their
patrimonie, fall to begging of poore mens houses ouer theyr
heads, as the last refuge of their ryot, remoouing the auncient
bounds of lands to support their decayed port, rather coueting
to enclose that which was wont to be common, then they wold
want to maintaine their priuate prodigalitie.</p>
            <p>The Temple of <hi>Terminus Deus</hi> amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> who

it vnlawfull for the bounds of landes to be couered, and that
rich men might learne to know their landes from poore mens
grounds. A strange thing it is, that these men cannot learne
to thriue before all be gone, and that they in the midst of their

labour, are nought but pouertie. But as the Brooke <hi>Achelous</hi>

            <p>In times past, ignorance in eache sexe was so odious, that
women as well as men, were well seene in all liberall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:

they gape after Colledge liuing, desiring to enrich themselues

the common cost, a man may easily gesse, how backward they
would be in giuing, who are now so forward in detracting. Can

Which opinion, although Sir <hi>Thomas Eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t</hi> a man of famous

iudgment, hee did acknowledge the diuersitie of mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es,
not to be so incommodious as he there pretendes. But that I
may aunswere what they vrge, first say they, what say you to
brute Beastes, who béeing nourished but with one kinde of
meate, and onely after one manner, are farre more healthfull
and sounde of body then men, that diet themselues with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
dishes: to this I answer, that either of these assertions are
vntrue, for neither doo they vse onely one kind of nourishment,
neither are diseases more distant from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then from vs. The
first is prooued by the choyse of Pastures wherein they graze,
<pb facs="tcp:10619:19"/>
where there is grasse both bitter and sauorie, soure &amp; sweete,
some nourishing colde, some nourishing hote iuyce, Is then
the substance of their meate simple, who feede vppon boughe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and weedes, besides so many sundry kinde of field hearbes, no
lesse diuers in nutriment then in name. To prooue that disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are no lesse incident to beastes then to men, I will sticke to
<hi>Homers</hi> authoritie, who reporteth the pestilence to be begun
by brute beastes. To shew how great the infirmities are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures, the short life of some of them may sufficientlie
serue, except you haue recourse to those recorded Fables of
Crowes and Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ens, who commonly sease vppon all kinde of
carrion, picke vp each sort of new sowne seede, and are at hoste
with euery kind of fruite in the Orchard. Secondly they adde,
that there was neuer Phisition so confidently carelesse of his
Patient, that he woulde prescribe the vse of diuers meates at
once, to him that is distressed with a Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, wherby (say they)
it may be gathered, that one kind of meate is more auaileable
to a speedie disgestion then many, because that Phisitions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
but one kinde of meate to them, whose disgestion is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest.</p>
            <p>This obiection is thus taken away, first there is not the
same proportion to be obserued in diet, in s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cknes, &amp; in health.
Secondly, in as much as they are wont to set before them, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one sort of meate, it is not because it is more easie of disges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion,
but least the sight of much meat should bréede in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> weake
stomacks a lothing of it. Thirdly they obiect, that the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of diuers meates is no lesse noysome, then the drinking
of diuers kinds of Wines is daungerous. Euery one knowes
that he that washeth his braines with diuers kinds of wines,
is the next doore to a drunken man, and he like (say they) to be

to me, because the grosenes of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meate remaining in one place,
expecteth the administration of disgestion, and béeing thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consumed, is suddainly voided, but Wine beeing by nature

               </gap>me, and therefore diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of wines at once, is shunned of them that are wise, least
the matter which is readie to possesse the head on a suddaine in

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itie of meates, no reason can be rendred why we shoulde
dread. But they will perhaps say, that the diuersitie of iuyce,
framed of the diuersitie of meats, agrees not with our bodies,
as though our bodies were not compounded of qualities, as of
hote and cold, dry and moist, but he which féedeth onely on one
kinde of meat, sendeth foorth but the iuyce of one qualitie, the
Spring is hote and moist, the Sommer dry and hote, Autum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>oth moist and colde together, so also the
elements which are our beginninges, what reason is it then
that our bodies should be restrained to one kind of meat. Thus
then we sée that diuersitie is not so inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious, but one kind
of meate may be as daungerous, for gluttony may as well be
committed by one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

surfet by eating a whole sheepe with <hi>Phago,</hi> or an Oxe with
<hi>Milo,</hi> as by the sipping taste of sundry dainties.</p>
            <p>But why stand I so long about meates, as though our life
were nought but a banquet, or why am I so large in disputing
of the diet of our bodies, as though thereby wee shoulde pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
quiet to our soules, what is this but to imitate the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
tender mother, which had rather her childe should be well
fed then well taught. Wherefore to make vse of my Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
as well to my selfe as to others, I will prescribe as neere
as I can, such a rule for Students, that therby squaring their
actions, they shall not be easily attached of any notable absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.</p>
            <p>There be thrée things which are wont to slack young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
endeuour, Negligence, want of Wisedome, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
<pb facs="tcp:10619:20"/>
Negligence, when as we either altogether pretermit, or
more lightly passe ouer, the thing we ought seriously to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Want of wisedome, when we obserue no method in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
Fortune is in the euent of chaunce, either naturally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or when as by pouerty or some infirmitie, or natural dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
we are withdrawne from our studies, and alienated from
our intended enterprise, by the imagination of the rarenesse of
learned men, but as touching these three, for the first, that is
to say, negligent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>loth, he is to be warned: for the second, he is
to be instructed: for the thirde, he is to be helped. Let his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
be temperate, whereunto wisedome, not wearines, must
prescribe an end, for as immoderate fast, excessiue abstinence,
and inordinate watchings, are argued of intemperance, perri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
with their immoderate vse, so that these thinges neuer
after can be performed as they ought in any measure: so the
intemperate studie of reading, incurreth reprehension, and that
which is laudable in his kinde, is blame woorthy by the abuse.
Reading, two waies is lothsome to the mind, and troublesome
to the spirit, both by the qualitie, namely if it be more obscure,
and also by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> quantitie if it be more tedious, in either of which
we ought to vse great moderation, least that which is ordained
to the refreshing of our wittes, be abused to the dulling of our
sences. We reade many things, least by letting them passe, we
should seeme to despise them, same things we reade, leaft we
should seeme to be ignorant in them, other thinges we reade,
not that we may embrace them, but eschew them. Our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ought to be our liues amendment, and the fruites of our
priuate studie, ought to appeare in our publique behauiour.</p>
            <p>Reade that sitting, which may be thy meditation walking,
shunne as well rude manners as rude phrase, and false dealing
as much as false Latine, &amp; choose him to be thy teacher, whome
thou maist more admire when thou séest then when thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
<hi>Quid faciendum sit, a faciente discendum est.</hi> Learne of all
men willingly that which thou knowest not, because humility
may make that common to thee, which nature hath made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to euery one. Thou shalt be wiser then all, if thou wilt
<pb facs="tcp:10619:21"/>
learne of all. Heed what <hi>Chrisippus</hi> saith in his prouerbs, that
which thou knowest not, peraduenture thy Asse can tell the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

If thou be desirous to attaine to the truth of a thing, first learn
determinate conclusions before thou dealest with doubtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies,
he shall neuer enter into the reason of the trueth,
who beginneth to be taught by discussing of doubts. Thinke
not common things vnworthy of thy knowledge of which thou
art ignorant: those thinges are not to be contemned as little,
without the which great things cannot stand. Post not rashlie
from one thing to another, least thou maist séeme to haue séene
many things, and learned fewe. <hi>Nil assequitur qui omnia sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
I am not ignorant, that farre more ardent is the desire of
of knowing vnknowne thinges, then of repeating knowne
things, this we see happen in Stageplayers, in Orators, in al
things, men hast vnto nouelties, and runne to sée new things,
so that whatsoeuer is not vsuall, of the multitude is admired,
yet must Students wisely prefer renowned antiquitie before
newe found toyes, one line of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Maister, before the
large inuectiue <hi>Scolia</hi> of the <hi>Parisian</hi> Kings Professor.</p>
            <p>Many there be that are out of looue with the obscuriti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
wherein they liue, that to win credit to their name, they care
not by what discredit they encrease others shame, and least by
the contention, their vaunted victory might be destitute of all
glorie, they encounter with them on whose shoulders al Artes
doe leane, as on <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>las</hi> the heauens, thinking that men shoulde

               </gap>te knowledge of all excellent Arts,
durst vndertake such a taske, as though any were more readie
to correct <hi>Appelles,</hi> then the rude Cobler, to contend with <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi>
then contemptible <hi>Pan.</hi> But these vpstart reformers of
Arts, respect not so much the indagation of the truth, as the
ayme of their pride, and coueting to haue newe opinions passe
vnder their names, they spende whole yeeres in shaping of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ects. Which their pudled opinions are no sooner published, but
straight way some proude spirited princocks, desirous to differ
from the common sort, gets him a liuerie Coate of their cloth,
<pb facs="tcp:10619:21"/>
and slaues it in their seruile sutes, enlarging the wilful errors
of their arrogancie. Nothing is so great an enemie to a sounde
iudgment, as the pride of a péeuish conceit, which causeth a man
both in life and beliefe, either to snatch vppe or hatch newfan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.
This one thing also deceiueth many, forsooth they wyll
seeme wise before their time, that nowe they both beginne to
counterfet that which they are not, and to be ashamed of that
which they are: and therein they are most distant from wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
wherein they thinke themselues to be thought wyse.
Others there be that thinke so well of themselues, that no
word can so much as scape by chaunce, but they thinke it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a pen-mans paines, and striuing to speake nought but
prouerbs, they make their bald eloquence a common by word,
cockering themselues in their owne conceits, till they be scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as cockscombes. These they be that knowing not howe to
speake, haue not learned to hold their peace, teaching manie
times the thinges they vnderstand not, and perswading what
they knowe not, becomming the Maisters of the ignorant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be the Schollers of the learned. There is no such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
of Arte, as an ignoraunt Artificer, men of meaner
iudgement, measuring oft times the excellencie of the one,
by the ignoraunce of the other. But as hee that censureth
the dignitie of Poetry by <hi>Cherillus</hi> paultry paines, the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
of Rethorick by the rudenesse of a stutting <hi>Hortensius,</hi> the
subtiltie of Logique by the rayling of <hi>Ramus,</hi> might iudge the
one a foole in writing he knewe not what, the other tipsie by
his stammering, the thirde the sonne of <hi>Zantippe</hi> by his scold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
so he that estimats Artes by the insolence of Idiots, who
professe that wherein they are Infants, may déeme the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
nought but the Nurse of follie, and the knowledge of
Artes, nought but the imitation of the Stage. This I speake
to shew what an obloquie, these impudent incipients in Arts,
are vnto Art.</p>
            <p>Amongst all the ornaments of Artes, Rethorick is to be
had in highest reputation, without the which all the rest are
naked, and she onely garnished: yet some there be who woulde
<pb facs="tcp:10619:22"/>
seperate Arts from Eloquence, whose oppugne, because it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres
from common experience. Who doth not know y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in all
tongues taske eloquence is odious if it be affected, and that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is altogether wanting, where it is reiected. A man
may baule till his voice be hoarse, exhort with teares till his
tongue ake, and his eyes be drie, repeate that hee woulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade,
till his stalenes dooth secretlie call for a Cloake bagge,
and yet moue no more then if he had béen all that while mute,
if his speech be not seasoned with eloquence, and adorned with
elocutions assistance. Nothing is more odious to the Auditor,
then the artlesse tongue of a tedious dolt, which dulleth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
or hearing, and slacketh the desire of remembring, and I
know not how it comes to passe, but many are so delighted to
heare themselues, that they are a cumber to the eares of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
pleasing their Auditors in nothing more then in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pause
of a ful point, when as by their humming and hawking respit,
they haue leisure to gesture the mislike of his rudenes. To the
eschewing therefore of the lothing hatred of them that heare
them, I would wish them to learne to speake many things in
few, neither to speake all things, which to theyr purpose they
may speake, least those things be lesse profitably spoken which
they ought to speake: neither would I haue them ouershoots
themselues with an imitation of breuitie, so that striuing to
be very short, they should prooue very long, namelie, when as
they endeuor to speake many things breefelie. Perswade one
point throughlie, rather then teach many things scatteringly,
that which we thinke let vs speake, and that which we speake
let vs thinke, let our speeche accorde with our life. Endeuour
to adde vnto Arte Experience, experience is more profitable
voide of arte, then arte which hath not experience. Of it selfe
arte is vnprofitable without experience, and experience rashe
without arte. In reading, thou must with warie regard learne
as wel to discerne thy losse as thy gaine, thy hurt as good, least
being wonne to haue a fauourable like of Poets wanton li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es,
thou be excited vnto the imitation of their lust. It is very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séemely that nobler wits shoulde be discredited with baser stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb facs="tcp:10619:22"/>
and those who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> high and mightie callings doo expect, shold
be hindered by the inticements of pleasure and vanitie. Young
men are not so much delighted with solide substances, as with
painted shadowes, following rather those thinges which are
goodly to the viewe, then profitable to the vse, neither doo they
loue so much those things that are dooing, as those things that
are sounding, reioycing more to be strowed with flowers then
nourished with frute. How many be there that séeke truth, not
in truth but in vanitie, and find that they sought not according
to trueth, but according to vanitie, and that which is most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
in the words of life, they toile for the merchandise of
death. Hence commeth it to passe, that many make toyes their
onely studie, storing of trifles, when as they neglect most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
treasures, and hauing left the Fountaines of truth, they
folow the Riuers of opinions. I can but pittie their folly, who
are so curious in fables, and excruciate themselues about im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
questions, as about <hi>Homers</hi> Country, parentage,
and sepulcher, whether <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Hesiodus</hi> were older, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Achilles</hi> or <hi>Patroclus</hi> more ancient, in what apparrell
<hi>Anacharsis</hi> the <hi>Scithian</hi> slept, whether <hi>Lucan</hi> is to be reckoned

such vnnecessary questions, according to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
are made as touching the soule, as whence it is, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

whether one soule serueth no more but once and one, what it
shall doo, when as by vs it shall cease to doe any thing, howe it
shall vse his libertie, when as it is escaped out of this dungion,
or whether it be forgetfull of former things? what do al these
<pb facs="tcp:10619:23"/>
things auaile vnto vertue? Wherfore, euen as he that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth
to saile ouer the endlesse Ocean, whiles he cannot passe
any further, is constrained to returne by the way he came, so
these men beginning to sound the infinite depth of these miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in ignorance, are faine to cease in ignorance: let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
refraine from such folly, and not seeke that which is not to
be found, least they find not that which is to be found. <hi>Socrates</hi>
who reduced all Philosophy vnto the manners, sayd, that thys
was the greatest wisedome, to distinguish good &amp; euill thinges.
Unto which discerning distinction, is required deliberatiue
meditation, in so much as in it, consists our liues vertuous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
Neither is it to liue well one daies worke, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
exercise of our whole life, béeing the best effect that euer
knowledge did afford. When as wee duely consider, whether
euery way leadeth, or wisely ponder with our selues to what
end we refer each one of our actions, and exact of our straying
thoughts a more seuere account of their wandering course, we
shal find no victory so great, as the subduing of vice, nothing so
hard as to liue well, no such vnestimable iewell, as an honest
conuersation: let him that is inclined but to one extreame, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
try by himselfe, with what facilitie or difficulty he may
suppresse it in himselfe, and his owne practise will teache him,
that he is led captiue by his owne inclinations, and ouercome
by his wicked cogitations. If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so difficult a thing in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment,

               </gap>, of an altogether euill conuersation. Since
then the onely ende of knowledge, ought to be to learne to liue
well, let vs propound this vse and end vnto our selues, least af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so many yeres paines, we misse of the marke whereat our

let vs with <hi>Themistocles,</hi> set before our eyes one of the

hath so gloriously garnished. I will referre you to his workes,
and more especially to his Schoolemaster, where he hath most
learnedly censured both our Latine and Greeke Authors. As
for lighter studies, seeing they are but the exercise of youth to
keepe them from idlenes, and the preparation of the minde to
more weightie meditations, let vs take heede, least whiles we
seeke to make them the furthering helps of our finall professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they proue not the hindering harmes of our intended vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that we dwell not so long in Poetry, that wee become
Pagans, or that we make not such procéedinges in <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
that we prooue proficients in Atheisme. Let not learning,
which ought to be the Leuell, whereby such as liue ill, ought
to square theyr crooked waies, be the occasion vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

haue beene too tedious to the Reader in enlarging a Theame
of Absurditie, desiring of the learned pardon, and of Women
patience, which may encourage me héereafter, to endeuour in
some other matter of more moment, as well to be answerable
to the expectation of the one, as to make amends to the other.
In the meane time I bidde them both farewell.</p>
