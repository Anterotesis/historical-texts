            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

betweene God and us, and that hath two Parts:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, The Promise on Godspart;</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on our part.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Promise on Gods part, and that is the gift of Christ, whom hee gives as freely, as a man gives his Lands to his heire; now Christ he comes not naked, but he comes accompanied with these three blessings.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, Iustification, and all that followes upon that.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Sanctification, to whom hee gives Christ, them he sanctifies with his Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, all outward things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:6769:3"/>Now there is a Condition required at our hands, and it is exprest by divers words in the Scriptures, sometimes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by the name of repentance, <hi>Repent, for the kingdome of heaven is at hand.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by the name of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, <hi>Beleeve me; and you shall be saved.</hi> And here it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is set downe by <hi>following of Christ.</hi> All these are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, for if you Repent, you Beleeve, and follow Christ, and none can follow Christ, without Faith and Repentance.</p>
            <p>Now the occasion of these words, is this: Our Saviour had told them a little before, <hi>That hee must suffer many things</hi>; he must die, &amp; rise againe; and then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6769:4"/>
tells them the consequent of this, that they must not looke for a temporall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, my Disciples fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, and I goe rough wayes: So that the maine duty that hee gives them here, is to follow him; to this hee addes two Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or two causes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which wee cannot by any meanes follow him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, <hi>Hee must deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> that is, If a man will come to follow me; the flesh will propound to him many things that are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and profitable; it will be as a rough byas to turne him aside, and therefore he must deny himselfe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his owne flesh. And againe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6769:4"/>
he will meete with many afflictions; and for those hee must not looke out of the way, but hee must goe through these crosses, hee must take up his crosse day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Doctrine is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That no man can have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>without selfe-deniall: If any man will will be my disciple, let him deny himselfe.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though before you come to Christ, there is nothing required, but a simple and bare desire. It is no matter for Sanctification; yet when we do come, he must then be our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and wee must follow him, denying our owne lusts; and this cannot be without selfe-deniall; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6769:5"/>
therefore it is that, that those that have failed in this point have not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. <hi>Demas</hi> followed him a great way, but when he came to this selfe deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, then hee left him, and embraced this present world, and this was the reason why <hi>Paul</hi> followed him, because hee was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deny himselfe; What was the reason that <hi>Caleb</hi> followed God so constantly, because hee denied himselfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved whatsoever he saw, to sticke close to God, and his Commandements; and so <hi>Abraham,</hi> hee left his country and friends clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God.</p>
            <p>Indeede if our will and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6769:5"/>
Christs Will were coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, then this might be without selfe-deniall, but being at oddes, we cannot goe together, for wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walke together, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreed, and therefore wee must conforme our selves unto Christ, his Will must not be brought downe to ours, but our will is out often, and therefore it must be wound up to his.</p>
            <p>Now the Question will be what selfe-deniall is.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quest.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>To deny a mans selfe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> is not to make himselfe his end, but God onely, and to renounce himselfe as sorry, hee is opposite to God and his wayes; So that to deny himselfe 'is to

deny the aversement the corruption &amp; illnesse of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is called the <hi>flesh,</hi> the <hi>body of death,</hi> and the <hi>old man,</hi> and the <hi>old leaven,</hi> which are a mans selfe; and this the Apostle meaneth, <hi>Wee preach not our selves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.5.</note> 
               <hi>but Iesus Christ</hi>; that is, I preach not for applause and vaine-glory, to please my selfe by my selfe, here he meanes his flesh, which hee will not satisfie; for when the Apostle had told them of his Vision and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.5.</note> of such a man, said he, I would rejoyce, of my selfe I would not rejoyce. Why should hee not rejoyce of himselfe? Because himselfe was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a bundle of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6769:6"/>
in himselfe was no good but of such a man so renewed hee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>
            <p>But why is flesh called a mans selfe?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quest.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Because it is so spread over all the faculties and powers of a man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> and is predominant as the forme over the matter, for a man loves it as himselfe and fights against all things that oppose it, and nourisheth all that nourisheth it.</p>
            <p>But how is it possible that a man can deny himselfe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quest.</hi>
               </note> for in denyall there must be one to aske, and another to deny, there must be one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, and one denyed; himselfe must be denyed? how can himselfe deny himselfe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:6769:7"/>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note>To this I answer, that there is in every man that is in Christ a double selfe, and the regenerate man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hath three natures. First, a common nature, neither good nor bad in it selfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, a spirituall and renewed condition, Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the flesh and corruption. The meaning then is this; common nature guided by the spirit and renewed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to deny the flesh, that is, the corrupt natures peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when both stand in competition the flesh is to be denyed, if the flesh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires honours riches and preferments beside the rule, then the flesh is to be denyed, but the Spirit is to be heard in all his requests,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6769:7"/>
and this is that, that every man must doe if he will be saved and there is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessity but much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why wee should deny our selves, as in every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God there is much reason if wee could see it, so here is great reason for this.</p>
            <p>First in regard of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> God hath no causes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee may thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the end: but every creature hath an efficient and finall cause: therefore it must not make it selfe its order, it is against the order of nature, and rule of things that the creature which is not of it selfe should make it selfe its end, being mans efficient cause is out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6769:8"/>
therefore his end must needes be out of himselfe, hee should make himselfe God, and God an Idoll: For if a man will set up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that is, will not deny himselfe, he sets himselfe above God, and makes a God of himselfe. We doe not worship God as wee as wee ought without wee deny our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.</note>In regard of our selves, because if wee doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our selves wee destroy our selves, because when we yeeld to our selves wee yeeld to the disease, and when wee yeeld to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, wee destroy our selves; this disease is the flesh, every man is <hi>aeger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter morbum &amp; medicum</hi>;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6769:8"/>
now which is better for a a man to hearken to the Spirit, the Phisitian, or to the flesh the disease. This reason is taken out of the sixt of the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6.6.</note> he that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reape corruption; but hee that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reape life everlasting. He that yeeds to his flesh doth destroy himselfe, for all the wayes of sinne leade downe to the chambers of death, that is, they bring death at the latter end, that is the fruit and wages of it at the last, but he that doth deny himselfe, doth best provide for himselfe, for he hath not onely the generall promise,<note place="margin">Mar. 10.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

therefore deceive not your selves in this, to thinke you may follow your selves, and yet follow Christ.

So the rich man in the Gospell, because hee had set his heart upon his wealth, Christ told him that time that he could not follow him. The light of the body is the eye, if the eye be single the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is light,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.22.</note> but if the eye shall be darke, marke what is said there of a single eye, and what opposition is made; An eye is sayd to be single in respect of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that is, if the eye bee single &amp; look only on God, then all the body is light, that is, all his life is good, God counts his sinnes but infirmities. But if a man have a wicked eye, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6769:14"/>
is if the eye bee double, but it is put in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, because a double eye is a wicked eye, that is, looking partly upon God and partly upon himselfe, then the body is darke; and there is good reason for this: For it is impossible if a man doe not make God his utmost end to be saved, if he make himselfe his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate end, he then makes himselfe joynt God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this man will bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in all his wayes, and therefore is not pleasing to God. The reason why God regards them not is because they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant:<note place="margin">Iam. 1.8.</note> A double minded man is unstable in all his wayes: who will regard
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6769:14"/>
him that is a friend to day and none to morrow? God loves not such whose hearts are not perfect with him; now no man is such that does not deny himselfe perfectly, if there bee any sweet morsell that he keeps under his tongue and will not part with it.</p>

               </note> It is true some things are evidently good, and some things evidently bad, but in things ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it is hard to discerne the flesh, a man may desire such a preferment, and think he does well, but yet this desire may be from the flesh, and therefore there are some rules whereby wee may discerne whether our desires come from the flesh, or no, and how wee may doe them.</p>
            <p>If you finde the desires <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> turbulent, it is a signe they come from the flesh; for the desires of grace are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6769:28"/>
like them that come from pure nature;<note place="margin">Gen, 30.1.</note> as <hi>Rachels</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, give mee children or else I dye: The vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy shewes it came from the flesh.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> When the desires are hasty, it is a signe they come from the flesh, for it is the property of the flesh to runne without his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond, to goe without his rule, the foole rageth and is carelesse, where is a wise man saith <hi>Salomon</hi> that pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his wayes: we cannot goe about that which is good, without considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Psal. 119, 59.</note> I considered my wayes saith <hi>David,</hi> and turned my feete into thy testimonies, If our nature were good, the more hasty it is to any
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6769:28"/>
thing the better it would be, but being our nature is bad it is likely the hastier it is to any thing the worse the things.</p>
            <p>If you finde the thing desired to strengthen the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> flesh; it is from the flesh; if it strengthen the Spirit then it is from the Spirit; if it weakens the Spirit and workes in us any indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to doe any good, as to pray, toward the word and such like, then it doth not come from the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Consider what you doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in like cases, where you have no selfe respect, wee may do many good things, and yet have selfe respect in them: for example <hi>Iehu</hi> was zealous enough for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6769:29"/>
God, so long as he expected a kingdome, that pricked, but when it was gotten he fell to Idolatry. And so those they were ready to fast and pray, but there was selfe respect in it:<note place="margin">Hos. 7.14.</note> They assemble themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the Prophet saith it was for corne and wine: and so they were ready to follow Christ, but it was because they eate of the loaves and were filled,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.26.</note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in sicknesse and trouble are ready to pray and to seeke God, but when the storme is blowne over, what doe they then? by this wee may learne somewhat to judge whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires come from the flesh or no.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:6769:29"/>Hence learne how to judge of your condition,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> whether you are in Christ or not. Christ puts it as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary condition to deny your selves. It is a sure rule if you deny your selves you are in Christ, if not you have no part in him, but here every man (as it is the part of the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) will say he doth not professe himselfe, no body will grant that hee doth please himselfe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the tryall of this, take these rules. If you will know whether you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your selves or not, first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> consider whether you are throughly humbled, vile &amp; little in your owne eyes:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6769:30"/>
such a man is not angry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee hath no more grace but wonders he hath so much. He lets God deale with him as hee lists, if hee will have him to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced willing to be shifted from vessell to vessell, from condition to condition, so hee have God in heaven, what becomes of him hee cares not. He counts Christ his greatest good, and sinne his greatest evill; He cares not what he looseth so hee can get God, such a man will deny himselfe, and no man else; we may see this disposition in <hi>Paul,</hi> if God will not have him preach in <hi>Bithinia,</hi> what desire soever he hath, he will not doe it; if God will have him shut

hee will bee more vile, but take a man of a contrary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition, that hath a proud heart, that will have such a thing or else all is marred, such a man will not deny himselfe; if God come to him aske his credit or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or any thing else, hee will not doe it, hee resists God, and God resists him. But God gives grace to the humble, that is, he shews fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to him,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.5.</note> &amp; whatsoever he asketh he will grant him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if you would know whether you deny your selves, consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you doe it in time of difficultie, when lust and oppertunity meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is no matter what you say in cold blood, A

Now if these things be setled in us we shal come easily to deny our selves; now that you may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to this, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider two things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:6769:38"/>Consider all these crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein you see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> comfort can neyther doe you good nor hurt without God, there is nothing that doth good but the blessing of God, or the cursing of of God, that is, no creature can comfort unlesse God bids it comfort us: for that is the blessing of it when God must say refresh him, comfort him, strengthen him, or else it cannot doe no good.<note place="margin">Ier. 4.24.</note> I am the Lord who shew mercy, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteousnesse, he shewes mercy not the creatures, Therefore wee had neede to deny our selves in any thing that is contrary to him. The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are but instruments,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6769:39"/>
and you know all instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments worke by some effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, which they receive from their efficient cause, they comfort with bor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rowed comfort, as the ayre inlightens with borrowed light, and the water heats with borrowed heate.</p>
            <p>If you get your requests, riches and honours, and pleasures to you, eyther they will be snares to you, or crosses to you, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not promise our selves good from them as they come from Gods promise, but onely from his mercy. So on the other side, when we deny our selves, we can have no hurt by them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse God bids them hurt us: let the Axe be never so
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6769:39"/>
keene, yet it will never doe any thing, except the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter takes it in his hand and sets to the work, so the tongues of men, though they bee as sharpe as a sword, yet <hi>Shimei</hi> cannot curse <hi>David</hi> till God bids him curse him.</p>
            <p>Put case that they will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hurt you or doe you good, yet all things wherein God bids you deny your selves you must, God hee keepes all things, commit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what thou hast to him, put them into his hand. It was the speech of a great and wise man when he fell from the favour of the King, if I had served God, as I have served the King, I had not come to this, that

is, had I committed the Kings favour to Gods kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping I should not have lost it: There is no change here upon earth but there is first a change in heaven: except there bee an eclipse first there, you shall finde none here to helpe you to deny your selves, labour to act these three graces.</p>

the love of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and therefore hee had an eye unto the recompence of reward; <hi>Goe and sell all that thou hast, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven</hi>; Christ bids the young man in the Gospel, if hee had belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he would have done it,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.21.</note> for the Saints they suffered with joy the spoyling of their goods, knowing in themselves how they have a better and more enduring substance:<note place="margin">Heb. 10.34</note> So <hi>Paul</hi> they wondered that hee had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured so much, but he saith therefore wee labour, and are rebuked because wee trust in the living God, which is the Saviour of all men, especially of such as beleeve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:6769:42"/>Let a man stirre up his love, that will make him move him to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, we know what is sayd of love there.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.4.5.</note> Love suffers long, it is bountifull it seeks not her selfe, it will deny her selfe for Christs sake as <hi>Paul</hi> did.

Lastly, when you come to any particular case wherein you come to deny your selves, bring arguments, give not over till you have

brought your selves to some conclusion. For this consider these things.</p>
            <p>First, put case you deny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> your selves in any pleasure, you gaine more pleasure by it, for no man ever loosed by denying himselfe, for he doth gaine peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and joy in the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Secondly, consider if you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> deny your selves you doe wipe away your blot, and it is a great matter to keepe your selves blamelesse with God and spotlesse with the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly if you give way <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to your inordinate desires you shall bee subject to a hundred indigences, and it is a mans happinesse that

he meets as little as he can, but to stand on his owne bottome.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Againe consider if you deny your selves, in such a case, you are freed from the greatest bondage that can be: as <hi>Paul</hi> said, you will not be brought under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of any thing by denying your lusts,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.12</note> you gaine the greatest freedome that can be.</p>

               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.</note> strong affections bring strong afflictions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:6769:43"/>Last of all consider, if you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> yeeld to such a desire it will never make an end, for you doe but adde fewell to the fire; the greater the fire is, the more fewell it requires, and there is no way to extinguish our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, but to put out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sparkes of our lust; therefore in any particular case of lust, never give over till you have brought your selves to this resolution, whether it is best to deny my selfe or not to deny my selfe.</p>

many tribulations entred into the kingdome, so should they, and if there were no other reason wee should rest in this: for in many things wee have no reason but Gods will: As thou hast hid these from the wise and men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and hast revealed to fooles;<note place="margin">Matth. 11.25, 26.</note> even so Father for thy good pleasure was such: and partly hee doth it that there may bee a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse borne to the truth: Now there is a twofold witnesse.</p>
            <p>First, a witnesse in words which may bee done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out crosses.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a witnesse in deedes, when with mans blood there is a witnesse

And againe that those that are appointed, might be tryed, that those that are good might bee knowne: As it is sayd of heresies, there must be heresies even among you,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.19.</note> that they which are approved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you might bee knowne: So it may be said of crosses, there must bee crosses, that the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers might be distinguished from the worldlings, the

Gold from the Copper.</p>
            <p>It must needes bee so if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wee looke upon the nature of the thing: No duty but hath one crosse joyned with it: If wee come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a man which must be done, yet this will bring losse of credit, friends, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and life, as it did <hi>Iohn Baptist:</hi> It cost him his life;<note place="margin">Matth. 14.10.</note> wee must preach and professe Christ, which will bring trouble, ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and persecution, as it did <hi>Paul,</hi> as it did Christ, as it did <hi>Daniel,</hi> wee must keepe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and walke downe right with God, and yet this will breed us much trouble, this will cause us to be loosers, when others
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6769:47"/>
are gainers: it will cause us to loose many advantages, which we might gaine with wicked consciences.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It must needes bee so in regard of the world, the world hates them, the world loves her owne, and they are opposite to them: if they were not opposite to the world, or able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist their forces it might be otherwise, but the Saints are of low estate, and where the hedge is low every beast will leape over. The godly are Antipodes to the world, they are of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition, and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the world; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it fareth with them as it did with Christ; when Christ<note place="margin">Luk. 2.35.</note> is come then the

thoughts of many hearts shall be opened, that is, to oppose; for before Christ came they thought no hurt, and so it is with the Saints that are the Image of Christ, that have the same spirit with Christ, that doe the same things for kind, though not for degree with Christ.</p>
            <p>It must needes bee so in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> regard of the Saints, they neede this to keepe them in order, they neede humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they neede a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of their repentance, they had neede to bee cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised for their sinnes past; as we see in <hi>David,</hi> Also to keepe them from future sinnes, that they might keepe the flesh low; for

God does with his Saints as Shepherds do with their sheepe, the Shepherd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sends his dog onely to barke at his sheepe, if that would doe it, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hee sends his dog to bite them too, onely to keepe them in the right way.

and therefore it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If we looke upon our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, they shew that it is a difficult thing; they are apt to be distempered, and quickly stirred up, and when they are distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not easily quieted, hardly ruled; our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ready to take hold of every twig, to stay us in our wayes; so that our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are moved upon every occasion, to love when wee should not love, and to love and to over-love, and to joy and over-j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In respect of our nature; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> In a man out of Christ there is a common nature and a corrupt nature; and in a man in Christ there are these two things though there bee something else.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Consider it comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and it is difficult, if wee compare Religion with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things; as take other things whereto our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are agreeable, there is a difficultie in them if they be excellent as manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all arts they are hard.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6769:50"/>
is a difficult thing, there is much labour to get much wisedome in these artes, there is much trouble and griefe of the flesh: Now Religion is an art above all, much more harder then all these, and much more difficult.</p>
            <p>The varietie of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> a Christian is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in, shewes that the way is difficult, a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an must bee content to doe every thing, and to suffer any thing, hee must learne to bee in low estate and high estate, to be in riches and poverty, hee must learne to want and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, now to doe all this is difficult; may bee a man cares not for poverty,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6769:51"/>
when hee hath riches, but when riches doe encrease hee sets his minde upon them readily: Its hard for him to resist, the world comming upon him, and though hee can doe this let passe riches too, yet it may be in a matter of praise, he can bee content to have praise, and seeke it where hee should not, and if not so, yet disgrace againe and an ill report that is a hard thing to beare, or againe it may be hee can beare ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, yet hee hath some thing which hee doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire much, and hee cannot leave that, some delight that is connaturall to him, some lust that is deare to him, therefore to keepe a

so, is from the distemper of our nature, we finde them so distastefull, because of the badnesse of our nature even as you say of meate and drinke, if any man aske you what, is not the meate sweete, yes, but to a weake and sicke stomacke they are most unsavory a sicke man cannot endure meate and drinke, and he takes it for the greatest injury you can doe him to set them before him. And dowe not say of light it is most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant? as it is indeede, but if a man have sore eyes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is so unpleasant to him as light: So it is in the wayes of God, they are light they are most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in themselves, but to

those that have sore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences they are the worst of any things. But are there none that finde this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? yes, there are some that are removed out of their sicknesse, those that have a desire to keepe the Law of God finde this pleasure and content as the Apostle speaketh of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wee speake among you that are perfect: So we may say of all the wayes of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.6.</note> though to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, to sicke men, to wounded men, to those that have a sore consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they are not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, yet to the perfect they are pleasant, that is to those that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the highest

pitch of a godly life, but those that are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and upright, for so (perfect) is taken in that place.</p>
            <p>If the wayes of God bee so full of difficulty and crosses,<note place="margin">

               </note> how can a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe them? this is the way to make men affraid of the wayes of God; it is a hard thing for flesh and blood to doe all this, and who shall bee religious, and who shall bee saved, if all this be true.</p>
            <p>For answer to this as Christ sayd to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:6769:54"/>
owne hands should turne when he would; for to doe this to walke in these wayes of God, with man it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible while hee is left to his owne strength, yet it is most possible with God, but how is it possible? for answer to this, foure things there are which makes it easie.</p>
            <p>It is possible if God give <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> you a new nature, yee shall have new affections, and new delights, if wee have a new Law given us, wee shall have new delights in it, and then wee shall doe it with delight and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If you consider that though the toyle of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and it being taken
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:6769:54"/>
alone, and it doth make them of all men most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, as the Apostle saith, if we have our reward here we are of all men most miserable,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.17.</note> yet if you put into the other end of the ballance, that which wee have for reward, that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. accompanies the paines, they are made sweete. As it is with the Merchant man, tell him of the danger he must undergoe, then it is difficult for him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, but he considering the gaine hee shall get by his travaile undertakes it: And so the covetous man greeves to breake his ease, but the gaine sweetens all the toyle, for we say, <hi>Finis dat amabilitatem medijs,</hi> let
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6769:55"/>
a man looke to the end, and it will sweeten the whole labour: So Phisicke though it bee bitter, yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it procureth our health, it is easily taken of us. Though the wayes of God are odious to the flesh, yet if we looke to the crop, the gaines, the victory that followeth, then wee may walke in them with ease.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If the burthen be heavy yet if a man have a new suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient strength given him, hee rasily beares it. If you put a heavy burthen upon a child having but a childes strength it will presse him downe, but give a man strength and he will easily bare it. Set a man to doe a work and if he have no skill
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:6769:55"/>
then it is hard to be done; but if he have skil &amp; the art, then hee doth it with ease, so if God give strength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the burthen, which he layeth on us, then wee doe it with ease: if God give new habits, new gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> abilitate us &amp; make us to beare the burthen.</p>
            <p>For a man to part with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the things, that are pleasant to him according to the the flesh, with the things that he prizeth much, that he thinkes his life, and his safetie consists in, while he thinkes of them, thus it is hard to deny himselfe: but let a man bee enlightned once and they bee shewed him, to be onely as vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things; while hee sees
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6769:56"/>
them as vanitie hee will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise them; and therefore the Scripture calls them <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; no man grieves at the flowers which are within his hand; or for the losse of some counters, or false treasure, or that the shadow perisheth. Now the things of the world are like to these as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.10.</note> 
               <hi>The rich shall vanish away as the flower of the grasse,</hi> that is, though hee be glorious for a time in the sight of all men, and in his owne conceite, yet this beauty presently perisheth, and so a man must reckon of his treasure, but as some counter or counterfeit trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as that place declares. If<note place="margin">Luk. 16.11</note> we have not beene faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:6769:57"/>
must count that as gaine; looke about and consider what is deare to you and resolve to leave it: And know that when the knot is tied between God and you and the band be made, then you are engaged to this; it may be God will not bring you to it, but you must howsoever prepare for it; shall a souldier goe to war and not make account of enemies? hee is no good souldier that resolves not to dye in battell: shall a Pilote goe to Sea and not resolve for a tempest? <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaks of a fortitude which comes from ignorance when they see the thing more difficult, and their strength lesse then they

thought of, they presently desist; and so wee finde it with many Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they considered not before of the danger, they leave off the good way that they began to walke in; many a man goes out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> leaves the flesh, and resolves to take a new course but hee dyes by the way, and never arriveth at heaven, by reason of the difficultie he meeteth with never expected, therefore say with your selves though Sommer be now, yet Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may come, though it be faire to day, yet wee know not but a storme may come before night, prepare therefore for a storme in a faire day.</p>
            <p>

And if this example will not serve the turne, then looke to Iesus Christ, in him there was no want of wisedome, in him there was no want of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and yet hee was thus opposed: therefore you must be so farre from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your selves freed from troubles, and crosses by your discretion, innocency and good parts, that you must bee resolved on the contrary, that the more you have of these, the more you are liable to the crosse, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:6769:60"/>
there is good reason for it, for if the object be greater the more the facultie is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised above it. Now goodnesse and holinesse is the object of the worlds hatred, the more of this goodnesse and holinesse you have, the more the world hates you: And the more you grow in grace, the more opposition you will have. The world loves her owne, therefore in what measure a man is not the worlds, in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the world hates him: and therefore take heed of mistaking the wayes of God; and you have more reason to looke to it now at the receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for if you bee in this

way, many thinke if they sinne and aske God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse they may come to the Sacrament; but that is not enough; you must remember that whosoever takes Christ as a Saviour, must take him as a Lord too: you finde these two words joyned together, the Lord our Saviour; and what God hath joyned let no man seperate; that is, he that will have Christ as a Saviour,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.5.</note> must have him as a Lord too: many will serve Christ as retainers doe; they will attend on their Master on Sabboth dayes, and Holy-dayes, and weare their Liveries, but will not doe any other service all the weeke, so wee would

take Christ for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to have the use and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of him, but wee are not willing to serve him, wee are loath to take him as an husband, for better for worse to subject our wills to his: some come to the feast without their wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garments of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall love.

Take the most learned man though hee found out an art, yet he never finished it, yet Christ hath done this: Therefore looke to him; though there be a cloud of witnesses as a cloud went before the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> yet Christ is the surest guide: But further to explaine this I will shew you two things.</p>
            <p>First, what it is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, whom you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are to follow; first the act, and then whom you are to follow.</p>
            <p>First what it is to follow,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and thus I may briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it to you:<note place="margin">A descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</note> To follow Christ is nothing but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, to doe and suffer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:6769:75"/>
and withall our heart what hee commands, &amp;c. There are foure diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult things put together in this description, which are to be handled severally.</p>
            <p>I say to follow Christ, is nothing but to resolve, that is, when you come to Christ once, you must have a minde to goe which way soever hee will lead you: wee must not reason with flesh and blood, but be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to him, not knowing whether we goe, as a man that goes into a strange county, hee puts himselfe into another mans hands, saying I will follow thee; bee the wayes what they will hee is resolved to goe through rough and plaine,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:6769:75"/>
thicke and thinne, whether his place bee dangerous or safe, hard or easie, such a resolution must they have that follow Christ, there must be no mincing, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted place, I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee but not in this path, but not in this place, as the Apostle speaketh you have obeyed from the heart to the whole forme of doctrine whereunto you have beene delivered;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.17.</note> that is, there is a whole forme of doctrine, every jot of this must be obeyed, Christ hath delivered you to obey it, that is, to this end Christ hath redeemed you from hell and death, that you may obey the whole pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of it; not picke and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:6769:76"/>
chuse, but whatsoever hee doth command wee must resolve to obey, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver way hee lead to follow him, may be hee will lead through poverty and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and disgrace, &amp; hatred of all men, and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore I say wee must resolve to doe and suffer, for indeede suffering is but a higher degree of doing, as the Philosopher well sayd, bare suffering is not laudable, but so farre as a man acts in his suffering, that is, some actions there are that require but simple obedience, but in some acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you must suffer if you will doe them, the good ground brings forth fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te with patience, that is, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:6769:76"/>
duties have crosses joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them, with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bearing they bring forth fruite.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> Runne with patience the race that is set before you;<note place="margin">Rom. 2.7.</note> so we render it continuance, the originall is by patience in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So God sent <hi>Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> to tell <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 9.16.</note> what hee must suffer at <hi>Damascus,</hi> I will shew how many things hee must suffer for my names sake. So it is with every one that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led home to Christ. There are certaine things that hee must doe and suffer, that he must resolve to doe and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Secondly hee must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to doe and suffer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and with all his heart: There is a kinde of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:6769:77"/>
following which proceeds from a naturall inclination, as the leafe the bow, the Iron, the loadstone, they can doe no otherwise: thus must you follow Christ.</p>
            <p>But you will say have we flesh in us which is backward and untoward, and therefore wee cannot follow Christ so willingly. But as wee say a Beare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes to the stake <hi>obtorto collo,</hi> against his will, and this is found in the Saints as it is sayd of <hi>Peter,</hi> when thou art old another shall stretch forth thine hand,<note place="margin">Ioh. 21.18.</note> and ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her shall gird thee, and leade thee whether thou wouldest not. Christ tells him there of his death, and that hee should leade him whether hee would
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6769:77"/>
not, now <hi>Peter</hi> was a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, and wee cannot thinke but that he dyed and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Martyrdome willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> but yet hee should bee led whether he would not, that is, whether his flesh would not: it is true the flesh cannot thus willingly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ: therefore you must if you would follow Christ aright, finde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in you, that you should follow Christ, with propensivenesse and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly: to expresse this I have added these other words, <hi>with all your heart,</hi> wee finde expressed in the old Testament by three phrases, love the Lord with all your minde, with all your heart, and with all
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:6769:78"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> your might, first, with all your minde, that is, your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> understanding; secondly, with all your heart, that is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> your affections; thirdly with all your might, that is, with your executive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Wee are to follow him with all our minde, and I rather use these three, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the word (follow) is applyed to all these, some are sayd to be followers of such whose opinions they follow. As those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ramus:</hi> So some are sayd to follow <hi>Paul,</hi> some <hi>Apollos,</hi> but we must follow Christ: thus wee must follow his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his tenents, keepe close to his word, that is, wee should consider what Christ
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6769:78"/>
sayd, what the Scripture saith, for otherwise it is no faith, for is <hi>fides fundatur in ore Dei</hi>; wee must not take things on trust, wee must not receive such a truth, because such a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter set it downe; but wee must see what warrant it hath in the word of God, otherwise we are not roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the faith, we are to have an estimation of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall fathers, but we are to fix our eyes on Christ. As for example the doctrine of justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this you may learne out of writings, but you must see what footing it hath in the Scriptures, or else when our strong ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries set upon us wee
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:6769:79"/>
shall quickly be convinced: And againe you must doe it that when you preach the Word of God, you may have more authority: when one creature hath to deale with another it hath no authority, but when God hath to deale with the creature, hee doth much prevaile.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We use to say some fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low such a man whom they desire to imitate: for there are some who in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are higher then the rest of whom wee thinke that all that they doe is comely; and this is that second way of following Christ to love him, when wee affect whatsoever wee see him doe, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:6769:79"/>
wee see of him in his servants, that is, we must so imitate them as that our imitation may bee referred to Christ, when wee see the image of Christ in them, we must take heede that wee adhere not to the creature, but say it is a sparke and glympse of Christ; I will follow him: But above all take heede of the contrary, when wee see something of Christ ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in their conversation, that wee doe not despise and contemne him: It is the world that hates the godly. We are to follow him with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> all our might, that is, with al our executive powers; that is, whatsoever wee doe, whatsoever we act, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6769:80"/>
wee take in hand, wee must follow him, when a man followes another mans counsell, he will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that and nothing but that, as courtiers follow the King, when any one aske us a thing wee must pause upon it, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Gods will or not: As it is sayd of <hi>David, I have a man after mine owne heart, &amp;c.</hi> on this manner wee should follow Christ; wee must follow him at all times, for there are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine times, when it is easie to follow Christ; but there are some difficult when you are put to an exigent, when there is some difficultie in following Christ, now you must not picke and chuse,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:6769:80"/>
but you must take him for better and worse, there are some brunts as we may see, shunne not them. If <hi>Daniel</hi> might have spared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in such a brunt as this, he might have spared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in all, but wee see it might not doe it: If <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicai</hi> could have bowed to the Kings favorite which doubtlesse hee could not doe, then he he neede not have procured that displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. <hi>Moses</hi> might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed Pharaohs pleasure, if in some particulars hee might have granted to him, but he might not: we must not doe as many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants doe with their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, run from them when harvest comes in, when la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:6769:81"/>
begins; for if we doe wee may feare Christ will say to us, as such masters say to such servants. If you will stay from mee when I most neede you, I will not keepe you all the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides when I have no neede of you, and therefore take heede of it. If a man out of fearefulnesse in such times shall not follow Christ, he shall receive no reward. A souldiour when the battaile comes flees from his colours, but hee can bee content to take his wages and lye in quietnesse and peace: take heede of forsaking Christ when the battaile comes, that is, when there comes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing dangerous to the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:6769:81"/>
flesh: you must resolve to follow Christ thus. Christ tells you that if you follow him, that he hath no houses, no lodging, no earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, neither must you looke for any, your will and advantage must be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. In the world you shall have trouble: Hee dealeth with man in this case as <hi>Naomi</hi> dealt with <hi>Ruth</hi>;<note place="margin">Ruth 1.</note> wee see how shee dealt with her, shee bids her goe to returne againe, and tells her shee was too old to beare children, &amp;c. and then shee sets upon her againe; <hi>Behold thy sister is gone backe, and wilt thou goe alone</hi>? At length <hi>Ruth</hi> gives her this answer, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death should

part, <hi>I will goe, &amp;c.</hi> and there shee rests: After this manner Christ deales with us, when men come to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, he tells them they must looke for no Riches, as to the young man in the Gospell, goe and sell all that thou hast and then come to mee, you must looke for no ease. <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the birds of the ayre have nests, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to lay his head,</hi> you must looke for many crosses; but if hee meete with such a one that saith, naught but death shall part thee and mee, such an one Christ receiveth, such an one God accepteth. So that it is as it was with the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:6769:82"/>
               <hi>Israelites,</hi> if any one were faint hearted, he should not goe up to battaile, for they would doe no good, and then also they weakned others: So wee say to all men we tell you now what it is to follow Christ, you must go to warre with him, and wee tell you, if you be faint hearted, you must not come under the banner, if you will not follow Christ through the love and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of all men, through poverty and riches, you will doe no good, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others.</p>
            <p>Wee must follow Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> all manner of wayes, now for the meaning of this last it is this, that is, those two-wayes, inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:6769:83"/>
and there is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in both: you must follow Christ inwardly; whom I serve with my Spirit saith <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, I doe not onely doe the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worke, but I serve him with my Spirit, it is a hard thing to doe so, it were nothing, if wee were onely to doe the outward worke, but wee must doe it with our spirits, that is, when your conscience shall tell you within you, such a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you must not omit, such vaine glory you must not seeke, such pleasure you must part with: then so to doe that duty is to follow Christ inwardly; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all the inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your hearts to God,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6769:83"/>
who searcheth the inmost windings of the Spirit, that is difficult, many might goe well away were it not for the inward lust.</p>
            <p>You must doe it outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, you must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse his name, and that you must doe before a wicked and adulterous generation, when there is difficulty, shame and disgrace, then wee must follow Christ: so this was the occasion of these words, If you will venture to follow me, know this, that I must suffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; therefore deny your selves and take up your crosse daily and follow me. Many a man will follow Christ, but he will follow him a far
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:6769:84"/>
off, hee will follow him without his livery, that men should not know whose servant he is, but he that will follow Christ must follow his colours before all men openly: hee that will bee ashamed of me, saith Christ, I will bee ashamed of him before my father which is in heaven; wee are fallen into such times as it is easier to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ inwardly then outwardly, when men are ashamed to make shew of so much as is within them, whereas heretofore times were such as men should make a shew of more then hee had. So wee see what it is to follow Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in these foure things.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:6769:84"/>
First, to doe whatsoever he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> commands. Secondly to do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it with all our hearts, that is, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h all our mindes, with all our soule, &amp; with all our might. Thirdly, to follow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> him at all times. Fourthly, all manner of wayes.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
            </p>
            <p>The second thing is what is to be followed, and that is Christ, that is, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his example, and to follow his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, but this in the generall is to little purpose, therefore I will picke some speciall examples, &amp; some speciall precepts wherein wee are to follow Christ, therefore you shall finde these things in Christ example.</p>
            <p>First, hee was abundant in love which hee shewed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6769:85"/>
many wayes, hee shewed it by giving a life for us, no greater love then to give himselfe for us, when wee were his enemies, when there was no worth nor goodnesse in us, hee shed his blood for us.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> So it was shewed partly in his apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to giving.<note place="margin">Acts 20.35</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates this as a love saying of our Saviour: It is better to give then to receive. And what hee sayd no doubt he preached: againe another fruit of his love was to forgive, no disgrace no contumely so great, but hee easily passed it by: So in the greatest despite of all his crucifying hee easily forgave them that crucified him. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6769:85"/>
thing wherein his greatest love was seene, was his great compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his bowels rowled in him. Hee was compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate both to mens soules and bodies: So on other bodies,<note place="margin">Matth. 9.36.</note> hee tooke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on them as sheepe having no shepherd: So when hee saw the people fainting after they had followed three dayes,<note place="margin">Mark 6.38</note> hee had compassion on their bodies; he wrought a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to helpe them,<note place="margin">Col. 3.12, 13.</note> he fed five thousand with five loaves and two fishes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this is that that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us in Christ, <hi>Put on therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloved bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, &amp;c.</hi> And so I say to you
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:6769:86"/>
labour to abound in love, in love to God, and in love to one another, bee ready to doe any kindnesse, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give any unkindnesse, let your bowels melt over other mens miseries, have a tender compassion for other mens sins especially in ministers labour to have a love to all mankind, for it is love that edifies, knowledge that puffeth up, and it is that which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> moveth us unto in his Epistles; love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea transgressions and any offences wee must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them even as Christ forgave us our sinnes; If there be any infirmities we must passe by them as Christ passed by ours, that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:6769:86"/>
is, your failings towards Christ are ten times more then mens failings towards you, he forgave you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe you forgive them, and this love must be renewed at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hee was one that sought no praise of men, no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> no vaine glory, hee desired not to be some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the eyes of men, which appeares by this, all which he did hee laboured to hide, that which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in him, observing his miracles, charging those in whom he wrought them to be silent: Hee endured the Crosse and despised the shame, that is, when he was mocked he despised
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6769:87"/>
it; so should we despise the shame, marke the word despised the shame, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Crosse, because that was a heavy burden, and he endured the shame. There will still be <hi>Ishmaels</hi> that will mocke the <hi>Isaacks</hi> of God, false nicknames and approbrious speeches will be cast on such as make profession of Religion: But despise the shame, alas shame is but a chip of the Crosse;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> but why did Christ despise it? hee had an eye to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that is, when a man beholds God, and lookes upon heaven having such great things in his eyes, hee cares not what men say, and if you despise you w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6769:87"/>
despise credit as Christ did, as that deede of his shewes more pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inely.<note place="margin">Luk. 23.8.11.</note> 
               <hi>Herod</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to see him, <hi>Pilate</hi> sent him to him, and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected some miracle of him but Christ would doe no miracle, so that <hi>Herod</hi> his men of warre despised him: Now here a man is more put to it, when men expect somthing from him, when hee is ingaged for his credit to doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then to despise this, and omit this opportunity is a great thing. Hee was despised of <hi>Herod,</hi> and of his men of warre, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised obloquies &amp; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of men, and also praise of men; for it was but an empty thing; but
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:6769:88"/>
let the prayse of God bee great in your eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, hee was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obedient to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, if God would have him dye on the Crosse which was a great matter, hee would doe it: So in drinking of the cup hee seemed unwilling some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but yet since his Father had mingled it hee would doe it, this is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when we doe what God would have us doe? wee would have health but God puts us in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; hee afflicts us with sharpe diseases: this is the cup that my Father hath mingled for me, and I will drinke. And another part of his obedience is in this;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:6769:88"/>
when he had sent forth his Disciples, when they brought in poore fellowes he thanked God for it; of which there could bee no other reason rendred but his Fathers will.</p>
