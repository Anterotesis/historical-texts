         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Proceedings at the Seſſions
for London and Middleſex.</head>
            <p>THe Seſſions bginning on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> a young woman
was tried for Murthering her (ſuppoſed) Baſtard-childe.
Being Servant in a Victualing-houſe, a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
living in the ſame houſe, accidentally found
ſomething under the ſtairs wrapt up in a Cloth; which upon
opening, proved to be a young naked Childe; which had lain
ſo long there, (ſix or eight weeks, as it was ſuppoſed) that
'twas putrified. Hereupon the Priſoner was ſuſpected that it
might be hers, and ſearch'd by a Midwife and ſome Matrons,
who were of opinion that ſhe had a Childe, but not ſo lately:
And indeed ſhe confeſs'd, ſhe had a year or two ago, a little
one, but affirmed, that ſhe was then married, and abſolutely
denied that ſhe knew any thing of this Childe. Wherefore
there being no proof that it was h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs, and for that, being a
publick houſe, it was poſſible it might be laid there by another,
ſhe was acquitted.</p>
            <p>An Iriſh man walking by a Watchmakers ſhop, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no body in it, takes up a Watch fairly in his hand firſt, as
if he were going to cheapen it; but ſeeing no body come out
of the houſe to ſpeak to him, loath to loſe ſo convenient an
opportunity, goes his way with it: but a Gentlewoman over
the way took notice of him, and the people purſuing him, he
was overtaken, and the Watch found upon him in his hand.
He now pretended he meant not to ſteal it, but onely ſtept out
to ſpeak with one; but the Caſe was plain enough, and he
found guilty of Felony, and burnt in the hand.</p>
            <p>A young Gentleman, and a Servant to a Poulterer, were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
for breaking into a Gentlemans Chamber (which was
next to his) in <hi>Clements</hi> Lane in the night-time, and taking
thence 500 and 15 pounds. There was another concern'd,
who 'tis thought was the principal Contriver of the Robbery,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56560:3"/>
but he is eſcaped. This laſt was admitted by the Gentleman
now at the Bar, to lie with him in his Chamber, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that the Owner of the next Chamber had a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſum of money there, they reſolv'd to poſſeſs themſelves
thereof: in order to which, knowing that his Beds-head ſtood
juſt oppoſite to theirs, they firſt remove their own Bed, then
take down a large piece of Wainſcot, after that, at convenient
times, when they knew their Neighbour was abroad, fell to
work on the Brick-wall, which they dug through, and pluckt
up the Hanging on his ſide, and forc'd away the Bed, till they
got room enough to enter. Then they break open his Cloſet
and Trunk, take away the Money, very neatly carry off all the
Rubbiſh that had ſaln in on that ſide, return into their own
Chamber, pluck his Beds-head up cloſe to the wall, and ſet their
own in its former poſture; ſo all ſeem'd cleverly performed:
Then they ſhare the Money, 200 <hi>l.</hi> being left, and ſince found
in a drawer in the young mans Chamber; the reſt the other
two take, and ride down into <hi>Kent.</hi> The Owner of the
Chamber, at his return, perceives himſelf robb'd, but could not
imagine which way, finding his door double lockt, and all the
Chamber to appearance ſound; at laſt removing the Bed and
Hanging, diſcovers the Breach. That night the Gentleman
now a Priſoner, coming home-late, was ſeized, and the 200 <hi>l.</hi>
found. Some time after the other Priſoner coming to <hi>London,</hi>
was apprehended; but the third Criminal, with the far greater
part of the Booty, got clear off. They were both found guilty
of Felony and Burglary, but the young Geneleman ſeemed very
penitent and ſorrowful for the Offence which thus unhappily he
was drawn into.</p>
            <p>Something like this was charged upon four Scotch Tailors
in <hi>Bedfordbury,</hi> who lodging next door to a perſons houſe that
loſt one night above 60 <hi>l.</hi> out of an upper Chamber, he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
they muſt come in at the Gutter to do it, and immediately
got a Conſtable and took them all faſt aſleep in their Beds;
and upon ſearch could not, amongſt them all four, find any
greater Eſtate than the ſum of ſix Farthings: Wherefore there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56560:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being only ſuſpition, and that on very ſmall grounds, for that
it was proved there were divers other ways to come into the
Gutter beſides from that houſe where the Priſoners lodged;
therefore they were diſcharged.</p>
            <p>A Maid was arraigned for Firing her Maſters houſe in <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
garden.</hi> There were two of them committed, but onely
one indicted, and the other gave Evidence. One a Sunday-night
a Fire happen'd in this Gentlemans houſe in the Garret, where
there had been no Fire all that day, nor occaſion for any Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
ſo that it was reaſonable to ſuſpect it came by deſigne:
which ſeem'd more to reflect on the Priſoner, becauſe ſhe uſed
to ſit up often, and particularly that night after the reſt of the
Family. But it appearing by ſeveral Teſtimonies, that the
Maid was of very good Reputation, well educated in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, ſo far from a Papiſt, that ſhe had been that
day with her Maſter and Miſtriſs at Church, and no direct proof
againſt her, ſhe was acquitted. The Fire was ſoon eſpi'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and through Gods mercy extinguiſht without any great
damage.</p>
            <p>Another Servant was found Guilty of Murthering her
Baſtard-Child; She pretended to be delivered at the Houſe-of-office,
and that it was Still-born: but it was proved that ſhe
had privately wrapt it up in her Apron, and was carrying it
in an Hand-basket to bury it; but being met by one that would
needs ſee what ſhe got there, was diſcovered; and all this
within an hour after ſhe was Delivered. So luſty ſhe was to
do ſo Villanous a Deed, venturing abroad, and going a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
way from where ſhe dwelt, enough in that reſpect to
have occaſioned her own Death, (conſidering her condition) as
ſhe had been the means of the Death of her innocent Infant.
But though ſhe eſcaped catching Cold, ſhe did not eſcape Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
but is Condemned to Die.</p>
            <p>One Gentleman took a Tryal for Killing another at an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in <hi>Holborn;</hi> it appeared that the Priſoner began the
Quarrel, and upon a very ſcurvy occaſion on a Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> whereupon ſome perſonal reflections
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56560:4"/>
were raiſed on either ſide, ſo long, that being too paſſionate
to confine his Reſentments, he offered to reach his Sword: To
prevent that, the other caught up a Chair, but by Friends
ſeemed pacified. Immediately after, having both their Swords
on, the Priſoner drew, and the other as ſoon, or near as ſoon
as he; and ſome Paſſes and Parryings happened between them,
but were parted. And then the Gentleman deceaſed ſtept up
to the Priſoner, caught him by the Arm, threw him down, fell
upon him, and diſarmed him; but being taken up, returned
his Sword, and ſo the Fray ended, none preſent thinking any
harm done: But then the other Gentleman began to complain
he was Wounded, as indeed he was Mortally, for the ſecond
day after he died. It was concluded by the Gentlemen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that the Wound was received when the Deceaſed ran up
and cloſed with the Priſoner; ſo it was found Manſlanghter,
and the Gentleman took his Clergy: as to further Penalty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtained the Grant of a Pardon.</p>
            <p>As likewiſe had another Gentleman Convicted of the like
Crime committed by <hi>Charing-Croſs;</hi> it appearing that the
Gentleman dead, was a particular Friend of the Priſoners, and
that it was unhappily done in a ſudden heat.</p>
            <p>The ſame Proceedings were in the Caſe of a third Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
abuſed groſsly in the Street by a Footman, whom after
much patience, and retreating ſeveral times, and deſiring him
to go about his buſineſs, it was his misfortune to Kill.</p>
            <p>A Souldier Quartered at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> with ſeveral others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
in the Night ſet upon a perſon on the High-way, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
thither from <hi>London,</hi> led him into a Gravel-pit, took
away 6 or 7 <hi>ſhil.</hi> (all the Money he had about him) and ſeveral
Cloaths which he was carrying home. The man knew the
Priſoner, he having formerly quartered at his houſe; ſo get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
home, ſearches, findes he was out of nis Quarters; ſeizes
him next Morning when he came home: and now he was
Condemned to die for Felony and Robbery.</p>
            <p>One <hi>John Morgan</hi> was Indicted on the Statute, for that being
born a Subject of <hi>England,</hi> and having received Orders from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56560:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet he came into and remained in <hi>England.</hi>
There was very good Evidence that proved he was a Prieſt, and
had ſaid Maſs; but as formerly, ſo now at Bar he freely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
that he was a Prieſt. Some ſay he was heretofore a little
crazed in his Underſtanding, which was probable enough by
his Behaviour: However, the Offence being evident, according
to Law he was found Guilty of Felony and High-Treaſon,
and received Sentence to be Drawn, Hanged and Quartered.</p>
            <p>A Country-fellow pretending to give a Viſit to an honeſt
man whom he had formerly lived with, being by him kindly
entertained, made ſuch ill uſe thereof, as at laſt to ſteal an
Horſe from him, which he ſold to another: And being now
found out, was found Guilty and Condemned. Having of late
made a Trade of Horſe-ſtealing, and taken away ſeveral in
<hi>Buckingham-ſhire, Kent,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as was alleadged againſt
him.</p>
            <p>A wench was Condemn'd for murthering her Baſtard-child.
Being ſuſpected by her Miſtriſs, and examined, ſhe freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
that ſhe had put it into the Houſe of Office, and that it
crying, ſhe puſht it down with a ſtick.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman and two others concerned with him in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting,
above a year ago, to ſteal and force away a young
Lady of eminent Quality, on the Highway; for which ſome of
their Accomplices formerly taken, were condemned to die, but
obtained a Pardon, came now to take a Tryal for the ſame,
being charged with two Indictments, one for Felony, on which
they were acquitted; another for a Riot, to which they pleaded
guilty, and were fined, the Gentleman 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and the other
two 500 <hi>l.</hi> a piece.</p>
            <p>Two Perſons were ſeverally Tryed for Coyning and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting,
and the Melting-Pot and Stamp brought into Court;
One was ingenious at forging <hi>French</hi>-Piſtols ſo neatly, that you
could not diſtinguiſh them from the true ones: and the better
to carry on the work, he and his Aſſociates bought a Boat, and
pretended to carry Brick up and down the <hi>Thames,</hi> and there
did the jobb; however he got off. But another for Counterfeiting
was found Guilty, and to be Hanged, Drawn, and Quartered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56560:5"/>
An ingenious Villain had ſtoln a Mare doubly; firſt in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi>
and ſold her to one at <hi>Totnam-High-croſs;</hi> afterwards he
went thither and ſtole her again; but that was twice too oft in
truth, and once too much for him: for now he was caught
and Condemned to be hang'd.</p>
            <p>Whereas a Doctor of Divinity was two or three Seſſions ago
queſtion'd about a ſilver Salt, loſt out of a Room where he and
another were drinking in a publick houſe without <hi>Temple-bar,</hi>
the other perſon, who then abſconded, was now Convicted and
Burnt in the hand.</p>
            <p>A whole Leaſh of Harlots were Tryed for Stealing a Watch
from a young Gameſter, that was ſo courteous as to invite
them to a Bottle; and they, becauſe they ſaw he ſpent his
Time ſo ill, thought an inſtrument to meaſure it by no wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for him. Now upon the whole matter, it was thought fit
they ſhould be ſent to the Nunnery of <hi>Bridewel,</hi> rather than to
<hi>Tyburn;</hi> and ſo they were Ordered to the Hemp-Office:
Where poſſibly if they amend not their Lives, they may help
provide their own Deſtiny.</p>
            <p>Several leſs remarkable Occurrences, being Confined to a
Sheet, we are forced to omit. But in all there were Fifteen
Condemned to Dye, Ten Men, and Five Women: Whereof
