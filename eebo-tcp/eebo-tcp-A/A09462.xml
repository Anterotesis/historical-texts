            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

so our Sauiour Christ he was
in an other:<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 1.</note> but as these two
differed in their being in the
world: so did they not accord
in their being in the wildernesse. Iohn was with
some men, Christ with none; Iohn was with wild
men, Christ with wild beasts; Iohn was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Christ praying; Iohn was baptizing, Christ
fighting; Iohn was feeding, Christ fasting; Iohn
was encountring with Diuels incarnate, Christ
did encounter with the Prince of those Diuels.
From Iohn preaching in the desert, learne we

diligence in our callings: from Christ tempted
in the desert, see we troubles at our calling:
<note n="a" place="margin">Psa. 34. 19</note> Many are the troubles of the righteous, but the
Lord deliuereth them out of all.</p>
            <p>If it please you to giue these after-lines the
reading, you shall see set downe that monoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
or single combat, which was hand to hand
betwixt Christ and the Diuell. And as for
Christ Iesus, you shall see him fasting, fighting,
conquering. Fasting and an hungry, to shew he
was man: fighting &amp; encountring, to shew he was
Messiah; and conquering and triumphing, to
shew he was God. And as for the diuell, you shall
see him obiecting, answering, flying. Obiecting,
that<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 4. 3.</note> Christ might despaire;<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 4. 6.</note> answering, that he

            <p>In Christs temptations, we see the estate of
the<note n="e" place="margin">1. Pe. 2. 21</note> Church; in Satans assault, we see his malice
to the<note n="f" place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 8</note> Church. Is Christ tempted? thinke it not
strange if we fall into<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 20</note> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations. For the griefe
of the head, is the griefe of the<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26.</note> members: &amp; the
temptations of Christ, shew the temptations of
<note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Christians. It is true of Christ, that<note n="k" place="margin">Act. 14. 21</note> by many
tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he did enter into the kingdom of God:
that<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 2. 10</note> our High Priest was consecrated by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that so he must suffer and enter into his
<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 24. 26.</note> glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29110:3"/>
He is no sooner borne into the world, but he is
<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 2. 14</note> hunted by Herod; baptized at Iordan,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 3. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. 1.</note> but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
sets on him; a Preacher for repentance, but
the<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 7. 1.</note> Scribes proscribe him; to<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 11. 15.</note> worke miracles,

in his members. Thus the life of Christ was
a warfare vpon earth, and the life of Christians
must be a warfare vpon earth. We liue here in a
sea of troubles: the sea is the world, the waues
are calamities, the Church is the ship, the anker
is hope, the sailes are loue, the Saints are passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
the hauen is heauen, and Christ is our Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot.
When the sea can continue without waues,
the shippe without tossings, and passengers not
be sicke vpon the water, then shall the Church
of God be without trials. We begin this voyage
so soone as we are borne, and we must saile on
till our dying day.</p>
            <p>We do reade in Gods word of many kinds of
temptations: <hi>God, Satan, Man,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:29110:4"/>
the <hi>Flesh,</hi> are said to tempt. <hi>God</hi> tempteth man
to trie his obedience, <hi>Satan</hi> tempteth man to
make him disobedient: <hi>men</hi> do tempt men to try
what is in them: and <hi>man</hi> tempteth God, to trie
what is in him. The <hi>world</hi> is a tempter, to keepe
man from God: and the <hi>flesh</hi> is a tempter, to
bring man to the Diuell. So <hi>God</hi> tempted A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 22. 1</note> in the offering of his son: <hi>Satan</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Iob. 1. 18</note> temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Iob in the losse of his goods: a<note n="c" place="margin">1. King. 10. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Queene</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
Salomon in trying his wisedome: <hi>men</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ex. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.</note> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
God by distrust in the desert: the <hi>world</hi>
tempted Demas,<note n="e" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 10.</note> when he forsooke the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
and the <hi>flesh</hi> tempted Dauid,<note n="f" place="margin">2. Sa. 11. 4</note> when he
fell by adulterie. Doth God tempt vs? take heed
of hypocrisie: doth Satan tempt vs? take heed of
his subtiltie: doth man tempt man? take heed of
dissembling: doth man tempt God? take heed of
inquiring: doth the world tempt man? take heed
of apostacie: doth the flesh tempt man? take heed
of carnalitie. But do we so? are we warie of these
tempters? No, we are not, and therefore we fal.
We fal on the right hand, by temptations in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie,
and we fall on the left, by temptations
in aduersitie. Of the one it may be said, it hath
slaine<note n="g" place="margin">1. Sa. 18.</note> thousands: of the other, that it hath
slaine ten thousands.</p>
            <p>When we come and see cities dispeopled, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
defaced, and wals pulled downe, we say, the
<pb facs="tcp:29110:4"/>
souldier hath bene there: and when we see pride
in the rich, discontent in the poore, and sinne in
all, we may iustly say, the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pter hath bin there.</p>
            <p>Now of all other temptations, it pleaseth God
to suffer his Church to be tempted with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is neuer free either from the sword of Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael:
which is<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 21. 9</note> a reuiling tong: or the sword of
Esau, a<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 27. 41.</note> persecuting hand. Neither was there
yet euer Christian man found, who had not his
part in the cup of affliction. We must drinke of
the<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 20. 23.</note> same cuppe our maister did:<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 10. 24.</note> the disciple is
not aboue his maister.</p>

how sin is punished in vs, they may take heed
it be not found in them: that they<note n="c" place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 6</note> seeing our

the like trials.</p>
            <p>Thus a Christian mans diet is more sowre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
sweet: his physicke is more aloes then honie: his
life is more a pilgrimage then a progresse: &amp; his
death is more despised then honoured. This if
men would thinke of before, afflictions would be
as welcom to the soule of man, as<note n="d" place="margin">Ruth. 2. 8</note> afflicted Ruth
was to the field of Boaz. But because we looke
not for them before they come, think not on Gods
doing when they are come, and do desire to be

            <p>GEntle Reader, in the life of that worthie man
Master Perkins, his books for the most part were
printed at Cambridge. The onely reason was,
his desire to be Corrector to his owne bookes. Since
he departed this life, some good men haue brought
me certaine labours of his. I desire not to print them
to make gaine to myselfe, but because I would not
haue his labours to be lost. He was heard of many by
his speech, read of many in his writings, and his works
haue bene translated into many languages. Mislike
not this booke, because it was printed at London, his
auditors can tell it was as he spake it. If you say, it was
hard to write as he spake: know this, that he obserued
his auditors, and so spake, as a diligent Baru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Then was Iesus led]</hi> In the Chapter go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before is set downe the baptisme of our
Sauiour Christ, as also the great honour of
his Baptisme. And it pleased him to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
to shew that he was now installed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the office of a Mediator: and for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
solemnitie of his baptisme, he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
by the voice of God the Father
from heauen, to be the chiefe Doctor, and
the true Prophet of the Church of God: for
chap. 3. 17. it is said: <hi>There came a voice from
heauen, saying, this is my welbeloued Sonne, in
whom I am well pleased.</hi> And also it is said,
that <hi>the Spirit of God in the likenesse of a Doue
descended and light vpon him.</hi> Now so soone
as Christ was installed into his office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
and thus solemnely baptized, and
proclaimed, euen from heauen, to be the
sole Doctor and Prophet of the Church of
God, presently without delay, as is <hi>Marke
1. 12. he was led aside to be tempted of the
Diuell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:29110:10"/>
In that Christ is no sooner baptised,<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> but
he is presently tempted, it sheweth vs, that
all those which haue bene baptised, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vp their names to Christ, must make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to be tempted, and looke for tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For if Satan durst be so bold to set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Iesus Christ the head, who was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man but very God; how much more will
he be bold to set vpon vs, who be but weake
and sinfull men? And therefore so soone as
we haue truly giuen vp our names to God,
and become the faithfull souldiers of Christ,
and refuse to serue sinne and Satan, then will
the diuell incounter vs, and set vpon vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
we must looke for to be tempted, preparing
our selues to this spirituall battell, and <hi>put
vpon vs the whole complete armour of God. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.
6.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>But most men will say, this doctrine is not
true: for they neuer felt any such combat in
themselues, though they haue bin baptized
many yeares.</p>
            <p>I answer; such men whatsoeuer they be,
they haue onely the outward baptisme of
water, and neuer receiued the inward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of the Spirit: and such men do indeed
weare Christs liuerie, but do seruice to the
Diuell his enemie. And therefore let such
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29110:11"/>
persons reforme them selues, turne from
their wicked and sinfull liues, and seeke to
serue the Lord, and then they shall find this
doctrine most true. For the children of Israel
so long as they liued vnder <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
they were not persecuted by <hi>Pharaoh:</hi>
but when they did set their faces towards
the land of Canaan, then presently he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
them with all his malice and might. So
all the while men liue in Egypt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, in sin
and wickednesse, and serue the diuell, he will
let them be at quiet: but if euer we once set
our hearts on that heauenly Canaan, and
giue our selues to the seruice of God, then
he will with open mouth pursue vs, follow
vs with many armies, and cast an hundred
temptations in our way. And as a poore bird
which cometh to the shop, and when she
thinketh to get away, then cometh all her
paine, and the net is spread ouer her: so when
men begin to leaue their euill courses, and to
set themselues to serue the Lord, presently
the Diuell doth spread his net to intangle
them. This must teach vs to watch and pray,
that we enter not into temptation.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note> in that our Sauiour is no sooner
baptized, &amp; ordained to be the great Doctor
of the Church, but he is presently tempted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29110:11"/>
and encountred by Satan: hence we learne,
that all those which be appointed of God to
any speciall office in the Church or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale,
they must make account they
shall be tempted, and looke for Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
one way or other: it was that which
befell the head, and therefore let vs all that
be his members reckon of it. Example of this
we haue in <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 2. 14.</note> who so soone as he was
new called to be the guide and deliuerer of
the children of Israel, he was faine to flie
when he had killed the Egyptian.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 18.</note> And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
was no sooner appointed by God to be
King of Israell, but <hi>Saule</hi> did persecute him.
As soone as our Sauiour Christ had called
the Apostles to that office, he brought them
to the sea, and there by his diuine power rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a storme,<note place="margin">Math. 8. 23.</note> so as they cried out, <hi>Maister,
saue vs, or else we perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this the Lord doth in great wisdome:
for by this meanes he sheweth a man that he
is not able of himselfe to execute the duties
of his particular calling without the speciall
grace of God: and by these temptations and
trials, the Lord stirreth vp a greater loue of
his Maiestie in the hearts of his children, and
with it many other graces, as prayer, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp;c. and maketh these graces the better
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29110:12"/>
to shew themselues.</p>
            <p>Seeing that our Sauiour Christ begins his
propheticall office of teaching the Church
of God with temptations:<note place="margin">Doctr. 3.</note> this should admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the Ministers of the word of God, that
they of all other men are subiect to Satans
temptations, because they be the Lords
Standard-bearers, and his Lieutenants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom Satan and al his souldiers bend
all their forces, as souldiers often do against
the standard-bearer. When as <hi>Iehoshua</hi> the
high Priest stood before the Lord, Satan
stood at his right hand to hinder him, <hi>Zach.
3.</hi> 1. He was a lying spirit in the mouth of
foure hundred false Prophets:<note place="margin">2. King. 22.</note> and this old
red Dragon, <hi>Reu.</hi> 12. with his taile draweth
downe the third part of the stars of heauen:
he desired to winnow <hi>Peter,</hi> and to trie him
by temptations, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. And as the king
of Aram said of <hi>Acab:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. King. 22. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Fight not against small
or great, but against the king of Israel:</hi> so Satan
fighteth not against any so much, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of Israel, the Ministers of the Church.</p>
            <p>So then we may see, that temptations are
necessary for the Ministers of the word, that
they may both know what they be, and also
learne how to comfort others in time o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
temptation. Also to teach vs the true vse
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29110:12"/>
of the word of God, and the force of it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
temptation. For certaine it is, that
temptations teach men many things which
they could neuer learne by bare studie. So
that one sayd well: <hi>Reading, meditation,
prayer, and temptations,</hi> these foure make a
Diuine.</p>
            <p>The second point to be considered, is,
what was the cause which moued our Sauior
Christ to go into the wildernesse: which was
the leading of the Spirit: <hi>Iesus was led aside of
the spirit: Luke.</hi> 4. 1. or as the word signifieth,
he was <hi>caried apart, Mark.</hi> 1. 12. not by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but a voluntary motion. This was not a
locall transportation of the bodie of Christ,
as that of <hi>Eliah,</hi> and of <hi>Philip</hi> from the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch:
but by the inward instinct of the holy
Ghost he was mooued and made willing to
go,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> as the word which <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 1. vseth, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
plainely.</p>
            <p>And by the Spirit here, is not meant the
Diuell or an euill spirit, but the holy Spirit of
God, euen the third person in the Trinitie.
And so we see that Christ may both guide
the Spirit, and be guided by the Spirit: for
Christ as he is man is led and guided by the
Spirit; but as he is God, he doth guide and
send his Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:29110:13"/>
               <hi>Obiection.</hi> Christ sendeth the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note>
therefore cannot be led by it.<note place="margin">Ansvver.</note> 
               <hi>Ans.</hi> As Christ
was man he was guided by Gods spirit, as he
was God he sent the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Hence we may behold the exceeding ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of the manhood or humane nature of
Christ,<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> who as he was man was guided by
the Spirit of God, euen in his mouing from
one place to another. And it is that which
euery one should desire, to be like vnto our
Sauiour Christ in this, viz. to suffer our selues
to be guided &amp; directed by Gods holy spirit
in all our thoughts, words and deeds: for this
is a true note of Gods children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14.
but <hi>as many as are not led by the Spirit of God,
the same are none of his, Rom.</hi> 8. 9. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs all become plyable to the motions
and directions of Gods blessed spirit, so as
we can say as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith: <hi>When thou saydst,
Seeke ye my face:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 27. 8.</note> 
               <hi>my heart answered vnto thee:
O Lord, I will seeke thy face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Doctr 2.</note> from this that Christ was led vnto
temptations by the spirit of God, we learne,
that temptations come not by chance, nor
yet by the diuels will and appointment: for
he could not touch <hi>Iob</hi> or any thing he had,
till he had leaue giuen him by the Lord: and
he could not so much as enter into swine, till
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29110:13"/>
Christ gaue him leaue; but they come by his

               </gap>ust permission, and the speciall prouidence

               </gap>nd appointment of God. For as God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>reed,
that he which had ouercome all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
should be ouercome by Christ: so he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath appointed this combat by temptations
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o all men:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note> the place where it is tried, is the
world as a theater: the persons as souldiers
tried, are Christians: the person tempting, is
Satan our aduersarie: the beholders are men
and Angels: the Iudge or vmpire is the Lord
himselfe, so that the issue shall be good. And
therefore when we be tempted, we must not
thinke it strange: but rather as <hi>Iam. 1. 2. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
it exceeding ioy when we are tempted</hi> for
the triall of our faith and obedience. And also
seeing they come by Gods appointment, it
should moue vs all to endure them patiently,
seeing they cannot be auoyded.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ was led to be tempted:<note place="margin">Doctr. 3.</note> hence
we learne, that no man must wittingly of his
own head, cast himself into places of danger:
for Christ went not into the place of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
til he was led by the spirit of God. And
so indeed, if a man find himselfe moued by
some extraordinary motion and instinct of
the spirit, he may offer himselfe vnto danger.
So <hi>Paul went bound in the spirit to Ierusalem:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20. 22.</note>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:29110:14"/>
that is, he did willingly follow the motion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

And so many of the Martyrs, thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:29110:16"/>
Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Reason.</note> Christ would be tempted in the
wildernesse, where was none to help him nor
to assist him, because the whole praise of the
victory belonged to himselfe alone.</p>
            <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">5. Reason.</note> Christ went into the wildernesse,
that so after he might returne againe with
greater authoritie and reuerence to preach
the Gospell: for we know that when one
hath liued with vs, and departs for a season,
and after returnes againe, we do receiue him
with greater reuerence, and make more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of him.</p>
            <p>From this practise of Christ his going
into the wildernesse,<note place="margin">Against po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish eremits and Monks.</note> the Papists gather that
men may liue monasticall liues, in cloisters,
woods, dens, cels, &amp;c. from the societie and
companie of men: but this their collection
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is but fond, as may appeare by these reasons:
first, Christ did this by the speciall motion
and direction of Gods spirit: they go into
their cels without any warrant from God.
Secondly, he went but once for a certaine
time: they continue alwaies there. Thirdly,
Christ during his abode in the wildernesse
fasted and abstained from all sustenance;
but those amongst the Papists that liue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall
and solitarie liues, enioy all their
pleasure and delights in eating and drinking,

Christ, that is, sought to allure him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>

               </gap>lingly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29110:17"/>
permit and suffer him to tempt him,
because now he stood in our stead: and this
was a part of his sufferance to be thus temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the diuell.</p>
            <p>But how could Christ be tempted,<note place="margin">Question.</note> seeing
he was most holy,<note place="margin">Ansvver.</note> euen as he was man? <hi>Ans.</hi>
For all that he might be tempted, as our first
parents were before they had sinned.</p>
            <p>The Diuel tempts men either by conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into their minds some secret suggestion,
or else moues them by some outward obiect,
that he may put into them some conceipt of
that sin which he would haue them commit:
as vnto <hi>Iudas,</hi> the Diuel cast this vile thought
into his heart, <hi>Iudas</hi> betray thy maister, <hi>Iohn
13.</hi> 27. So here the Diuell suggests vnto the
mind of Christ these motions, to moue him
to vnbeleefe, idolatrie and couetousnesse.
But here is the difference: first, that Christ his
most holy heart withstands all Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
Againe, as these wicked motions
disquiet and trouble mens minds, and bring
molestations vpon them; so it befell our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ, for he was moued with these
temptations, but yet without all sin. Thirdly,
men when they are tempted, though they do
not altogether receiue and approoue of the
temptations, yet they be tainted with them:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29110:18"/>
but yet Christ was neuer so much as any whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
tainted, nor his holy heart did euer approue
of them in any sort, but constantly repelled
them. As if a man cast a match into tinder, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
will catch fire and burne; but cast it into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it will quench it: so temptations coming
into our hearts which be like vnto tinder, we
are easily tainted with them, though we d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
not altogether entertaine them: but the most
holy heart of Christ was as water to quench
them at the first.</p>
            <p>The Diuell tempts men with sundry blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous,
horrible, and vncleane thoughts.
Now that we may discerne them, and keepe
our selues from despaire when we find them
in vs, we must know that in the mind there
be many cogitations which arise of the flesh,
and from our owne corrupt hearts, and these
be sinne. Besides these there be other cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

he was thus tempted.</p>
            <p>The causes wherfore Christ was tempted,<note place="margin">Reasons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Christ vvas tempted.</note>
are these:</p>
            <p>First, because he was to vanquish the diuel
in his owne kind,<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> and at his owne weapon:
and as the first <hi>Adam</hi> was ouercome by his
temptations, so now the second <hi>Adam</hi> Christ
Iesus might vanquish him in the midst of all
his most fierce temptations.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> he was tempted, that by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
he might teach vs how to resist temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
as also to shew what temptations
are, and the power of them. And therefore
that common opinion, that if any be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously
tempted, men thinke they be notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sinners, and hauing forsaken God, he
now hath forsaken them: it is a false and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious
opinion: for here we see, that the
most holy Sonne of God himselfe was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted.</p>
            <p>Againe, seeing Christ the head was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">3. Reason.</note>
no member of Christ must looke to be
free from temptation, but we must euen make
account to be tempted.</p>
            <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">4. Reason.</note> our Sauiour Christ was tempted,
that so feeling the waight and daunger of
temptations, he might be a mercifull high
Priest to helpe vs in our temptations: as the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29110:19"/>
Apostle doth witnesse.<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The next point to be noted, is the cause
and author of his temptation: <hi>He was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the diuell.</hi> This name Diuell, signifieth
a cauililer, a slaunderer, a priuie accuser: for he
accuseth God to man, as he did to <hi>Euah. Gen.
3 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Hath God said indeed ye shall die?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> Nay, but
it is because God loues you not: for when ye
eate of the tree, God knoweth ye shal be like
vnto God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Diuel accuseth man to God,
and is therefore called the Accuser of the
brethren;<note place="margin">Reu. 12. 9. 10</note> one which ceasseth not to put vp
bils of accusation against vs, and to accuse vs
vnto God, as he dealt with <hi>Iob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Diuell accuseth one man to
another, by raising suspitions and bad surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and by backbiting one another. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the holy Ghost calleth Satan an accuser,<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note>
let vs all beware of accusing our brethren, of
slaundering and backbiting: for such men
become like vnto the Diuell. Againe, it must
admonish al men to beware that they do not
by any accusations or slanders, seeke to draw
men from embracing the Gospell: for they
which take this course make themselues Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
incarnate. Of this sort was <hi>Elyma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> the
sorcerer, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 10. whom <hi>Paul</hi> therefore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29110:19"/>
calleth the child of the Diuel. And thus much
of the first part of the preparation.<note place="margin">The second part of Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to temptations.</note> Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the second part, viz. the abode of
Christ in the wildernesse: which is set out by
three circumstances. First, by his fasting forty
daies and forty nights. Secondly by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
there, namely, the wild beasts, <hi>Manke

the Diuell did incounter him within the
space of those fortie dayes, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 2. though
the particulars be not set downe by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists.</p>
            <p>The first point, is Christs fasting in the
wildernesse the space of fortie dayes.</p>
            <p>There be three sorts of fastings:<note place="margin">Three kinds of fasts.</note> First, a
dayly fast, which is nothing else but the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

and we must take heed of the abuse of Gods
creatures by surfetting and drunkennesse.
<hi>Rom</hi> 13. 12.</p>
            <p>The second kind of fasting is a religious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
fast, when we abstaine from meate and drink
for a certaine time, that we may be more fit

for two or three, sometimes for many,
as 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 13. they fasted seuen dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is a miraculous fast, when any
one shall fast many dayes, and that beyond
the course of nature:<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 28.</note> thus <hi>Moses</hi> fasted fortie
daies and fortie nights in the mountaine; and
so fasted <hi>Elias.</hi> Now there is no man able to
fast so long by the course of nature. Indeed
<hi>Paul</hi> did fast three dayes after his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and those which were with <hi>Paule</hi> in
the ship in that dangerous voyage, <hi>Act. 27.
33.</hi> are said to haue fasted foureteene dayes,
which though some thinke is not meant of
abstaining from all sustenance, but that they
did eate very litle; yet the words are plaine,
that they did eate nothing for the space of
foureteene dayes. And though it be true that
Phisitions affirme, that a man may liue seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
dayes without meate, yet he cannot
endure longer, as twentie or thirtie dayes.
Now our Sauiour Christ fasted fortie dayes,
and fortie nights, and for all this his comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion
was not changed, nor the strength of his
bodie weakened; nay he was not hungrie till
the end: though men cannot fast a short time,
but it wil weaken them and make them hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
which doth proue this fast of Christ was
miraculous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:29110:20"/>
Now there be some reasons why Christ
fasted so long and no longer.<note place="margin">Reasons why Christ fasted so long.</note> First, that when
he came to preach the Gospell, he might
come with more authoritie and reuerence: as
when <hi>Moses</hi> had fasted fortie dayes, and
brought the two tables, the people receiued
him with greater reuerence.<note place="margin">1. King. 19. 8</note> So likewise <hi>Elias</hi>
when he was to restore Religion, he fasted
forty dayes and forty nights.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he fasted so long, that he might
answer vnto the time that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>
fasted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he fasted no longer, lest any man
should call into question his humanitie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was true man yea or no, if he had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
threescore or an hundred dayes.</p>
            <p>From this miraculous fast of Christ,<note place="margin">Against po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish fast in Lent.</note> the
Papists fondly gather their superstitious fast
in Lent; being but an apish imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ:
and in truth their fasting is no fast, but a plaine
mocke-fast, seeing they eate as liberally, and
fare as daintily then, as at any other time of
the yeare: whereas Christ abstained from all
vse of meate and drinke.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Christ was moued thereunto by
the instinct of Gods holy spirit; they haue no
word to warrant them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Christ did thus fast but once in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29110:21"/>
all his life: but their fast is continuall, euery
yeare, and therefore these reasons proue that
their collection is friuolous.</p>
            <p>The second speciall point to be marked in
the abode of our Sauior Christ in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
is his conuersing <hi>with the wild beasts,
Marke</hi> 1. 13.</p>
            <p>Some say the cause of his conuersing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the wild beasts,<note place="margin">VVhy Christ vvas vvith vvild beasts.</note> was, that they might
do him that homage which is due to the
Creator: but this opinion hath no warrant
out of the word of God, and litle truth in it:
for though it be true that Iesus Christ is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all homage, yet he came not to this
end into the world, but rather to take on him
the shape of a seruant.</p>
            <p>But the true cause is this: whereas there be
two kinds of wildernesses, one which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited,
and where <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist did baptize
&amp; preach: and another not inhabited, where
liued all kinds of wild beasts, as Lions, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Beares, &amp;c. Christ made choise of that
which was without the societie of men,
wherein were onely the wild beasts to beare
him companie, that so in this great combat
against the Diuell, he might shew he had no aide
nor comfort of any man; but that he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame
by his owne power, and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:29110:21"/>
the honour and praise of the victory belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to Christ Iesus alone.</p>
            <p>And besides, in the person of Christ we
may behold the estate of Gods church here
vpon earth, that she liueth here with wicked
men, which be no better then wild beasts, as
<hi>Esay</hi> 11. 6. doth testifie.</p>
            <p>The third circumstance whereby the abode
of Christ in the wildernesse is described,<note place="margin">3. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note> be
those temptaions which befell him within
the compasse of the forty dayes, for before
the three great conflicts, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 2. there is
mention made of other temptations, which
though they be not specified, yet it is very
likely that the Diuell did set vpon Christ by
sundrie, small, light and weaker temptations,
thereby making an entrance to his fiercer
and stronger temptations. For it is the diuels
maner to go on, and to proceed by degrees
in his temptations. As first he cast into <hi>Cains</hi>
mind an angry thought against his brother
<hi>Abel:</hi> after he preuailed, and <hi>Caine</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
displeasure against his brother, then
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he proceedeth to tempt him to murther, and
there he did not stay till he had brought him
to vtter despaire. So he dealt with <hi>Iudas,</hi> first
he put into <hi>Iudas</hi> mind this thought; <hi>Iudas</hi>
betray thy maister: which though <hi>Iudas</hi> did
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29110:22"/>

him the infirmities of humane nature, so
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29110:22"/>
farre foorth as they be without sinne: and
therefore he was subiect to hunger and
thirst.</p>
            <p>The causes wherefore our Sauiour Christ
was hungrie,<note place="margin">VVhy Christ was hungry.</note> are these: first, that he might
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hew himself to be true man, and that he had

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he infirmities of humane nature: and so we
see he would stop the mouthes of such as
should say, it was a small matter for him to
last so long being the sonne of God. But least
we should doubt of his manhood, he is here
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s we see touched with hunger, a true infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of mans nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he was thus hungrie, that by this
meanes he might cast vnto the diuell an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ect
to worke on, and giue him occasion to
be more fierce in his assaults.</p>

When Christ went vp to Ierusalem to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

the occasion wherby the diuel was especially

            <p>Now then seeing the diuell takes occasion
to tempt Christ, euen from the infirmitie of

               </gap>
brings the fire and bloweth it, but we affoord
him the fewell to set it a work. The diuell ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
the nature of men, their dispositions
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29110:24"/>
inclinations and behauiours, and continually
prieth into their dealings, and like vnto a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Captain, who besieging a citie, marketh
where it is most weake and of least resistance,
and there he bends all his forces, and placeth
his greatest ordinance, Euen so the diuel wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs and our behauiours, to obserue vnto
what sin we be most addicted, and by nature
most inclined, &amp; then he followes our humor
and feeds vs in our owne vaine. As if a man
be impatient of pouertie, he will egge him to
stealing, and to vnlawfull shifts to helpe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
if a man be couetous, he wil help to prick
him forward that way, that he may by hook

his temptations.</p>

The fourth point in the preparation of the
Diuell vnto his temptations,<note place="margin">The fourth point of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> is his coming
vnto Christ. And by this that it is said, <hi>the
Tempter came vnto him,</hi> it appeareth that he
came in some visible forme: as he did come to
<hi>Euah</hi> in the shape of a Serpent: so it is very
likely he came in some bodily shape to our
Sauiour Christ, seeing it is said here, that he
came and spake vnto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God, &amp;c.]</hi> The Diuel
hauing made this solemne preparation, and
hauing made choise of the fittest place and
time, and taken aduantage of the infirmitie
of our Sauiour Christ, now he sets vpon him,
and incounters Christ with his first temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
wherein the cunning Diuel disputeth like
a subtill Sophister, and disputeth very syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistically;
and his syllogisme may be framed
thus: If thou be the Sonne of God, then thou
canst commaund that these stones be made
bread; but thou canst not make these stones
bread, therefore thou art not the son of God.</p>
            <p>The maine scope of the diuels disputation
in this his first temptation, was this, to bring
Christ to distrust of his Fathers prouidence,
to ouerturne the faith of Christ, that is, that
gift in Christ, whereby he as he was man did
beleeue in God his father, and depend vpon
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:29110:26"/>
And in this dealing of the diuel with Christ,
we may behold what is the maine and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
end of all Satans temptations in the
children of God, viz. he labors to bring vs if
it be possible, to this, to make shipwracke of

               <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17.</note>

            <p>And here let vs see the practise of Satan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the faithful children of God; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as he dealt with our Sauior Christ, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade

            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:29110:26"/>
And therefore seeing the Diuel aimeth at
this one thing especially,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to ouerturne our
faith in Gods promises, it should stir vs all vp
to an earnest care to make our calling and
election sure,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 10.</note> euen to haue it sealed vp by
comfortable assurance to our soules: and this
will be a most sweet comfort vnto vs in time
of affliction, if we can find this blessed and
setled perswasion, that we are the sonnes and
daughters of God. And the diuell he careth
not what men professe no though they haue
all the common gifts of Gods spirit, to heare
the word, to vnderstand, to giue assent vnto
it, so that they want this blessed assurance of
Gods speciall loue in Christ.</p>
            <p>Againe, in this first temptation the Diuell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
tempts Christ to practise a worke of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe.
For now Christ wanting bread, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
tempts him in the absence and want of
bread, to make bread of stones, and so by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
meanes to help himselfe. And as the
Diuell dealt here with Christ, seeking to
tempt him to practise a work of vnbeleefe: so
doth he deale with vs, to moue men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in time of distresse to vse bad and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
shifts to helpe themselues. As in time
of pouerty and want, when men see not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means, such as they desire, he will tempt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29110:27"/>
them to shift for themselues, to filch and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from their neighbors, and to get bread by
bad meanes. In time of sicknesse, when men
cannot find help in the lawfull vse of phisick,
then he labours to draw them to seeke to the
diuell for helpe, by sending men to wise men
and women (as they call them) and so by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
meanes to seeke recouery of their health.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God]</hi> What moued
the Diuell to moue this question vnto Christ
rather then any other?<note place="margin">Question.</note> 
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First,<note place="margin">Ansvver.</note> because the
Diuel knew right wel, that if Christ were the
Son of God, then he was that promised Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah
and Sauiour of the world; and if he were
that promised Messiah, then he knew it was
he that should bruise the Serpents head,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.
3.</hi> 15. Now of all things the Diuell could not
abide to heare of that, and therfore he makes
choise of this question before all other, to
proue, or at least to go about to proue, that
Christ was not the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another reason may be this: since the diuel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleased:</hi> here
the Diuell comes and contradicts the voice
of God, nay, goeth about to proue God a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
in that he would make Christ beleeue
that he was not the true Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>Hence we may by this practise of Satan
learne to discerne false teachers.<note place="margin">Vse.</note> There haue
bene many both excellent and learned men,
which haue denied Christ to be the sonne of
God, as <hi>Ebeon, Cerinthus,</hi> and others, onely
affirming that Christ was an excellent man,
and a worthy Prophet. Now seeing they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
Iesus Christ to be the true Son of God,
they shew themselues to be false teachers,
and such as be the diuels scholers, for so saith
the Apostle <hi>Iohn, 1. Iohn</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Again, in that the diuel seekes to perswade <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Christ that he is not the son of God, (though
God by his owne voice from heauen had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
before proclaimed him to be his
Son:) hence we may perceiue the impudent
malice of Satan, who seeketh in all things to
contradict God himself. For if the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
a blessing vpon any man, the diuell he
wil presently pronounce cursing and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If God testifie to a mans soule that he is
the child of God, the Diuell he wil labour to
perswade him that he is not the child of God.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29110:28"/>
If the Lord affirme a wicked man to be out
of Gods fauor, and no child of God; the diuel
will labour on the contrary, to perswade him
that he is in good estate, &amp; shal be saued, and
so fils his heart with extreme presumption, &amp;
maketh him more bold then he ought to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Commaund]</hi> That is, as if Satan should
haue said to Christ, Bid this, or do but speake
the word and it shall be done. And herein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
the maruellous pollicy of Satan, who
in these few words (the better to bring his
purpose to passe) toucheth three especiall
points of Diuinitie: First, that he which is the
son of God, is true God equal to the Father,
which many heretickes haue denied, and the
Pharisies also did not graunt; for to worke a
miracle, it is the proper and peculiar work of
God alone. Secondly, the diuell confesseth,
that God is able to make all things of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and that without all meanes, matter or
helpers, by his almightie power. Thirdly, he
confesseth that God can effect a true miracle,
and that is proper to God alone, neither can
any creature whatsoeuer worke a miracle.</p>
            <p>Now when the diuel acknowledged al this,
one would haue thought he should haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
no harme in these words: but the
truth is, we shall see that in the propounding
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29110:28"/>
of these points, his pollicy was to ouerthrow
the faith of Christ; and he in propounding of
the truth, doth it not for any loue or liking to
it, but that he might more easily deceiue our
Sauiour, to bring him to doubt whether he
was indeed that Sonne of God or not.</p>
            <p>This must admonish vs to take heed that
we do not alwayes giue credit to the diuel, &amp;
listen vnto him though he speake the truth:
for such is Satans pollicie, that when he wold
seeme most to speake the truth, then he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to deceiue vs most; and by speaking the
truth, he seeketh most to ouerthrow our faith
in the truth. But as our sauiour Christ did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
their testimonie, though the diuels spake
the truth;<note place="margin">Mar. 1. 24. 25.</note> and as <hi>Paul</hi> did not suffer the Diuel
to speak in the maid,<note place="margin">Act. 16. 17. 18.</note> though he did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Apostles to be the seruants of the
true God: so we must beware how we listen
to Satan, euen when he speakes the truth; for
he neuer speakes the truth because he loueth
the truth, but that speaking the truth he
might be sooner beleeued, and more easily
deceiue vs, and do vs the greater harme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That these stones]</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> saith <hi>this stone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. 4. 3.</note> in
the singular nomber. To reconcile these two
places, whereas <hi>Mathew</hi> speaks in the plural
number of many <hi>stones,</hi> this we must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29110:29"/>
that he speakes of Satans temptations,
as he first set vpon Christ, and then in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his temptation, he bids Christ to
turne all these stones into bread. <hi>Luke,</hi> he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>this stone,</hi> speaking but of one, must be
vnderstood as the Diuell vrged and inforced
his temptation, the better to perswade Christ
to yeeld vnto it: as if the Diuell should haue
said, It may be thou thinkest it too much to
turne all these stones (being so many) into
bread, do but turne this one stone into bread,
because I would not trouble thee ouermuch,
that so I may beleeue thou art the son of God.</p>
            <p>By this dealing of the diuel with Christ,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> we
may learne, that when the diuell hath once
begun his temptation, then he will be more
instant in vrging of it, he is very loth to haue
the repulse, and therefore will vrge it and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it: but if he can gaine but a litle ground,
at least in some smaller matter, he would be
content; as here to perswade Christ, though
he would not turne many stones into bread,
that he would turne but this one stone into
bread. And therefore we must learne, that as
the diuell is very instant to inforce and vrge
his temptations, so we must be as instant to
resist them, and yeeld no not in the least mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               </gap>
God for the life of man: so it is taken <hi>Heb. 1. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
where Christ is said to beare vp all things by
his mightie word, that is, as the Lord ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
created al things, so doth he vphold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
them by his decree and prouidence.</p>
            <p>Now Gods word and decree concerning
the life of man, may thus be distinguished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
namely, that God hath decreed that some
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29110:32"/>
men should liue by bread, that is, by ordinary
meanes: secondly, some should liue without
ordinary bread, that is, without all ordinary
meanes: thirdly, that some should liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any means at al, either ordinary or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
as <hi>Moses, Eliah,</hi> our Sauiour Christ,
in their fortie dayes fast: fourthly, that some
should liue against meanes, and contrary to
the course of nature, as <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions
den, &amp; the three children in the fiery fornace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which proceedeth out of the mouth of God:</hi>
That is, by euery decree of God, by euery
blessing &amp; decree that God giueth out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the life of man. So then we see the
meaning of the words.</p>
            <p>If any say,<note place="margin">Question.</note> It seemes we must liue onely by
the word of God, &amp; without meate or drink,
euen by the scriptures and the written word.
I answer,<note place="margin">Ansvver.</note> No: but we must liue and preserue
our liues by euery word, that is, euery decree
that God giueth out to preserue the life of
man: so that without the speciall decree and
blessing of God, nothing could preserue and
maintain the life of man: our meat could not
norish vs, our apparel could not warm vs, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now let vs see how this answer of Christ
is applied to the diuels temptation. The diuel

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:29110:33"/>
consider the blessing and decree of God, that
bread should be the meanes to nourish man:
for besides the bread, there is the staffe of
bread, that is, that power and facultie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it nourisheth and maintaineth life,<note place="margin">Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch. 4. 16.</note> which
it hath from the decree and blessing of God
vpon it. And as we see an old weake man,
take away his staffe and he wil soone fall to
the ground: euen so if the Lord take away
the staffe of bread, that is, his secret blessing,
though a man had all the dainties vnder
heauen, his life would faile in the midst of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all; for the weake life of man must needs
fal &amp; decay, if once the Lord take away the
staffe of bread.</p>
            <p>For what reason is there, that bread which
hath no life in it, should nourish our bodies,
giue life &amp; stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to vs: and that that which
hath no heate in it, as our clothes, should
keepe vs warme, were it not for Gods word
and decree, and his blessing vpon them? And
that we may know, that it is not so much
bread that preserueth mans life, as Gods
blessing vpon bread by vertue of his word
and decree, we may see it plainely, in that
the poore mans child which fareth hardly, &amp;

the Prince: now the reason is, because God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
blessing is all in all vpon the poore fare of the
poore mans child, aswell as the Kings.</p>
            <p>2 Againe, seeing it is not so much bread,
as Gods blessing vpon bread, that preserueth
mans life, it should teach vs al sobriety in the
vse of Gods creatures: for neither meate, nor
drinke, nor clothing, can do vs good, vnlesse
the Lord send out his word and decree, and
giue a blessing vnto them, euen to euerie b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

we abuse the good creatures of God, in sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and excesse, how can we looke that
the Lord should blesse them vnto vs? nay we
may rather feare he will curse them for our
abuse and intemperancie, so that they shall
hurt, yea choake vs rather then do vs good.</p>
            <p>3. We must learne from hence, to vse the
creatures of God with inuocation vpon his
name for a blessing vpon them; for seeing it
is not the substance of bread that nourisheth
vs, but the blessing of God vpon the bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who seeth not, that we ought before we vse
the creatures of God, to craue a blessing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
God vpon them?</p>
            <p>4. This should teach vs to be content with
our estate, to moderate our affections, and to
take heed we do not so eagerly desire &amp; see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:29110:34"/>
for abundance: for the blessing of God is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
enough,<note place="margin">Pro. 10. 22.</note> &amp; hath not these cutting cares
with it: &amp; he which hath but a meane estate,
may be as wel blessed of God, as he that hath
the greatest abundance: nay this immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
seeking for abundance, it argueth great
distrust and vnbeleefe in the prouidence of
God.</p>
            <p>5. If mans life stands not in abundance,
and our life is not preserued by bread alone,
though a man had all the bread in the world,
vnlesse God infuse a blessing into it: this tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs, that we may not be so much intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with the things of this life: we must not
so eagerly seeke after meat, drinke, clothing,
lands, liuings, gold, siluer, &amp;c. for in taking
too much care for these things, we see many
mens harts are so caried away, that no grace
can take place in them.</p>
            <p>But you will say,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> meate, drinke, cloathing,
and such things, they be my liuing, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
liue without them.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> I aunswer, that our
liues do not stand in these things alone, but
especially in the blessing of God vpon these
meanes: without which, though we had
all the world at commaund, it could doe
vs no good. Againe, the Lord can not
onely preserue our liues by bread, but euen
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29110:35"/>
without all meanes, yea, if so it please him
against meanes. Now then seeing our liues
stand not in these meanes, but especially in
the blessing of God vpon them, we must first
seeke for the blessing of God, without the
which all these meanes shal become vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
vnto vs and do vs no good: and it is
not wisedome, too greedily to seeke for the
things of the world, seeing our life is not
preserued by them alone. Mans life standeth
not in abundance, saith Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>6 Seeing man liues not by bread alone,
that is, mans life is not maintained by these
outward meanes, but by Gods blessing vpon
them: this must teach vs all to be content
with that estate the Lord sends vs, though it
be poore and meane: and we must learne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
in extreame miseries and afflictions.
And if the Lord should deal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with vs as he
did with his seruant <hi>Iob,</hi> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all from vs,
yet we must be content, and take heed that
we do not suffer our selues to be swallowed
vp of too much griefe. For our life is not
maintained by these outward meanes of
themselues, but by Gods blessing vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
which is all in all: and when all meanes faile,
the Lord can preserue our life euen without
bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and against meanes too, if he please<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:29110:35"/>
Indeed if a man wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the outward meanes
and the inward meanes too, namely, Gods
blessing, then he had some cause to be
grieued: but seeing the Lord can saue our
liues both without all outward meanes, and
against meanes: though we want bread, yet
let vs cast our selues vpon the Lord, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
distrust his mercie; but say with <hi>Iob:
Though the Lord kill me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 13. 15.</note> 
               <hi>yet will I trust in him.</hi>
And let vs know, the Lord can increase the
poore womans cruse of oile,<note place="margin">2. King. 4.</note> and make it last
as well as the rich mans abundance,</p>
            <p>7 This should teach vs all to moderate
our affectiones, and to carrie an euen saile, so
as neither in the estate of wealth and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
we be not puffed vp with pride: nor
yet in pouertie to be ouerwhelmed with
sorrow. For though a man haue abundance,
it followes not that he is therefore blessed;
nor if he be poore and want riches, that he is
therfore cursed, and wants the blessing of
God: but in wealth and pouertie, the blessing
of God is all in all to make men happie.</p>
            <p>8 Lastly, this should teach euery one of
vs to labour all our life long to know the
prouidence of God, and to depend vpon it
in all estates of life, whatsoeuer the Lord
shall send vs: and when we can see this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29110:36"/>
of God, we must then hang vpon it,
as well in aduersitie as prosperitie, in sicknes
and health, in life and death. True it is, men
can acknowledge Gods prouidence in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie:
but we must learne to see the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of God aswell in aduersity, and then
to hang vpon it with both the hands of faith,<note place="margin">Pro. 16. 3.</note>
so as we can roule our selues vpon it, and can
euen wholly depend vpon it, and commit
our selues and all our waies to the Lord. The
children of Israel were fortie yeares learning
this lesson: which shewes it is an excellent
point, and not easily learned. And therefore
seeing it is of so great vse, and so necessarie,
let vs studie to know the prouidence of God,
and shew the true vse of it in our liues and
conuersations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the diuell tooke him into the holy citie,
&amp;c.]</hi> Now followeth the second conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the diuell and Christ, in the 5. 6. 7. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Now though <hi>S. Luke</hi> chap. 4. 9. placeth
this temptation in the last place, yet doth
this breede no great difference betwixt the
Euangelists: for <hi>Luke</hi> in pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of the words
and deeds of Christ, sets them downe as the
Spirit of God directed him, not regarding
precisely the time when they were done, but
sometime setting that first which was done
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29110:36"/>
last: but <hi>Mathew</hi> he sets the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> down in order as
they were performed by our Sauiour Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the diuell tooke him, &amp;c.]</hi> In this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict, we are to consider three points.
First, the diuels preparation to the combat,
vers. 5. Secondly, the temptation it selfe,
vers. 6. Thirdly, the answer of Christ, vers. 7.</p>
            <p>In the diuels preparation: first, the time,
<hi>then:</hi> secondly, the parts of his preparation,
which be two. First, he tooke Christ from the
wildernesse, and caried him to the holy citie.
Secondly, he setteth him there vpon a pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of the temple.</p>
            <p>First, in the circumstance of time, <hi>then:</hi> that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
is, as soone as Satan had taken a repulse and
was foiled of Christ in the wildernesse, he
presently setteth vpon him afresh, and caries
him to the holy citie to tempt him there.</p>
            <p>By this we may perceiue the malice of the
diuell,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> who as soone as he hath ended one
temptation ceasseth not there, but presently
prouideth another. The diuell neuer maketh
truce with man, but either he is busie in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting
of vs, or else he is deuising and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
new temptations; for he is neuer idle.</p>
            <p>Againe, hence we learne, that when we
haue ouercome in one temptation, we must
presently prepare our selues for another: we
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29110:37"/>
must not look to be at ease when we haue
giuen the diuell the foile: for he will set vpon
vs afresh, and tempt vs againe and againe.
Nay, our life is a continuall warfare against
sinne and Satan: &amp; therfore we must euer be
in a readines to encounter with our enemie.</p>
            <p>And if this lesson were well learned, and
as well practised, men would not be so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
in temptations when they befall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
then temptations would be farre more easie
to them, so as a man wold willingly and
chearefully indure them, &amp; vndergo them
though neuer so many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The diuell tooke him to the holy citie:</hi> Here
is the first part of the diuels preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now
by the holy citie is meant Ierusalem, as <hi>Luk.
4.</hi> 9. it is plaine.</p>
            <p>But how did the diuell carie our Sauiour
Christ from the wildernesse to Ierusalem?<note place="margin">How Christ was caried by Satan.</note> He
might do this three waies: first, in vision:
Secondly, by the ordinarie way: Thirdly, cary
him in the aire,</p>
            <p>First, by vision, as it was vsuall in the time
of the prophets.<note place="margin">Ier. 13. 4.</note> So <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was caried in
vision to the riuer Euphrates: but Christ
could not thus in vision be caried from the
wildernesse to Ierusalem; for then it should
haue bene no temptation vnto him in vision
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29110:37"/>
onely to cast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himselfe from the top of the
temple.</p>
            <p>Secondly, our Sauiour Christ might be led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
by the ordinarie way, and so indeed the
words will beare it: but I take it, it is not the
sense and meaning of this place. For if the
diuell led our Sauior from the wildernesse to
Ierusalem, then either with or against his
will; either of his owne accord, or else at the
perswasion of the diuell. But he went not of
his owne accord: for seeing he was led into
the wildernesse, and came to be tempted
there, he now being in the conflict, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not yet ended, he would not of his owne
accord depart thence to Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Secondly,
he would not go at the perswasion of the
diuell: for we neuer reade that he would do
any thing at the diuels perswasion, though
in it selfe lawfull.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Diuell might conuey and carie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the bodie of our Sauiour Christ in the aire,
from the wildernesse to Ierusalem: and this
is the opinion of the best Diuines, that the
diuell had power by Gods permission, to
transport the bodie of Christ in the aire, from
the wildernesse to the holy citie: and this
seemeth to be confirmed by the words
following, where it is said, that the diuell <hi>set
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29110:38"/>
him on a pinnacle of the temple.</hi> Now it is as
likely that he caried Christ from the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thither, as that the diuel had power to
place and set him on the top of the temple.</p>
            <p>Now then if the diuell had permission to
transport the bodie of Christ from the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
to Ierusalem:<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> this makes for that
opinion which is common in the world, that
the diuell can carrie a man or woman from
one countrey to another, if God giue him
leaue: but so as he cannot do it with such
celeritie and expedition as men imagine.
Some foolishly thinke, he can carrie one
many hundred miles in an houre, which is a
thing impossible: for such a violent motion
would stop a mans breath; as we see if a man
fall from the toppe of an high steeple, his
wind is gone ere he come halfe the way to
the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe hence we see, that the diuell may
by Gods permission haue power ouer the
bodies of godly men, and those which haue
greatest graces, and strongest faith in God.
For seeing he had power ouer the bodie of
Christ, to transport it from place to place by
the permission of God, why may he not if
God giue him leaue, haue power of any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
bodie, though he be neuer so true a beleeuer?
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29110:38"/>
If he had power in the head, why not in the
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers? if he had power to annoy <hi>Iob,</hi> to kill
his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; destroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though they were
no doubt the holy seruants of God, why may
not the diuell haue power ouer our bodies,
to carie a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one place to another? If the
Diuell could by Gods permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the
bodie of one that was a daughter of faithfull
<hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 10.</note> and euen 18. yeares afflict her, so
as she was bruised and bowed together by
Satan; then no doubt he can do the lesse, to
remoue mens bodies from place to place.</p>
            <p>And this may serue to admonish those,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
who thinke their faith is so strong, that the
diuel cannot annoy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or any way bewitch
them. But if the diuell haue power by Gods
permission to torment the bodies of the
faithfull, yea to destroy the bodies of <hi>Iobs</hi>
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who no doubt were the true seruants
of God, he may if God giue him leaue,
bewitch the godliest man that liueth. For
we know what the holy Ghost faith: that all
things fall out,<note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 2.</note> and all things come alike to
good and bad; and there is no difference in
outward things oftentimes betweene the
children of God and the wicked.</p>

Ierusalem was a mother Church, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
religion did flow and was dispersed into
many places of the world. Now for these
considerations Ierusalem is called the holy
citie.</p>
            <p>This church at Ierusalem though it hao
many corruptions in it,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> yet our Sauiour
Christ cals it holy: and it was a true Church
of God. Then hence I conclude, that the
Church of God in England, though there be
in it many blemishes &amp; corruptions, yet
may it be, and in truth is the true Church
of God. For the Church of God in England
is proprotionable to the Church at Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for as they had <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets
read and expounded, so haue we: nay, we
haue the Gospell now soundly preached<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which they then had not in so plaine and
plentifull manner as we haue. They had the
Sacraments of the old Testament: so we
haue Baptisme and the Supper of the Lord.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29110:39"/>
Their Church was a mother church to
deriue Religion to many other: and though
our Church cannot be called a Mother
church, yet it may be truly called a nourcing
Church to many neighbour churches round
about vs.</p>
            <p>As Christ and his Apostles did not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
separate themselues, or refuse to ioyne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
with them in the seruice of God, because of
the corruptions in this church at Ierusalem,
but did teach and preach in the Temple: so
none may therefore separate themselues,
and refuse to ioyne with the people of God
in his seruice and worship, because of some
few corruptions that remaine in it. Nay, such
as for these do separate themselues from
Gods people, do cut themselues from Christ
himselfe, seeing they seuer themselues from
the Church of God.</p>
            <p>If any shall say, that the church of Rome
is the true Church of God, as well as the
Church of Ierusalem, seeing the Romish
church hath as many priuiledges as the
Church at Ierusalem; I answer, By exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the particulars it will appeare to the
contrarie.<note place="margin">Rome no true church.</note> As first, the Church of Rome
braggeth, that she hath her succession from
the Apostles: but I answer, succession from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:29110:40"/>
persons, without succession in the Apostles
doctrine, can be no true note of the Church.
Secondly, the Church of Rome hath the
sacrament of Baptisme, yet that proues he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
not the true Church: for in Samaria they had
the Sacrament of circumcision, and so in
other places, and yet it cannot be proued
that they were the true Churches of God.
Besides, I answer, the church of Rome hath
baptisme no otherwise then a theefe hath a
true mans purse: now it cannot be said, that
a theefe is therefore a true man, because he
hath a true mans purse. Lastly, though the
Church of Rome haue the outward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
yet she in doctrine ouerturnes the
inward baptisme: namely, the true imputed
iustification and inherent sanctification of
Christ by the spirit.</p>
            <p>3 The Church of Rome holdeth the
Apostles Creed, but it is onely in word: for
the truth is, their God whome they worship
is an Idoll, and their Christ is a false &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Christ, forged by their owne braine,
as may appeare to all that will search their
doctrine.</p>
            <p>4 She saith, that they hold the word of
God, and the writings of the Apostles: but it
will appeare in their writings, that they hold
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29110:40"/>
it but in shew, not in truth: for in the maine
grounds of religion they ouerturne the
doctrine of the Prophets &amp; Apostles. Againe,
they hold the Scriptures but as a lanthorn
holds the candle, not for it selfe, but for those
that passe by: so the Church of Rome haue
the word of God, not for themselues, but for
the good of Gods children, which euer lye
hid in the middest of Poperie.</p>
            <p>5 She brags that she is the mother-church
of many Churches: I answer; we
must consider that citie, as Rome is, and as
Rome was: the old Rome which was in the
time of <hi>Paul,</hi> was the true Church of God;
but as for that old Rome, it is dead and
buried, and this new Rome is that whore of
Babylon, &amp; no mother-church, but a cruell
step-mother to Religion. By al this we may
see, that the present church of Rome, is no
Church of God, but onely in name and
outward shew.</p>
            <p>And seeing that the Diuell tempts our
Sauiour Christ in the holy citie, we learne
that there is no place so holy; but the Diuell
can broach his temptations in it, as we may
see <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 1. 2. and therfore this condemnes
that dotage and sorcery of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> who teach that their charmed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29110:41"/>
holy water, their coniured bread, and the
signe of the crosse, and such stuffe can driue
away the Diuel from their houses, and from
their persons: and yet we see here, that
neither the holinesse of Christs person, nor
yet of the place, could hinder Satan, but he
did tempt him</p>
            <p>Againe, we see it is to small purpose, to
the ende wee may bee freed from tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to change the place, or to change the
aire; for what place is there so holy, or so
sound and wholesome, where Satan cannot
and will not set his temptation on foote and
assault vs? Indeed to remoue the diseases of
the body, these may be of some force, to
change the ayre, &amp;c. but to cure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and to help the diseases of the soule,
this and such like can do nothing at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And set him on a pinnacle of the temple.]</hi>
Here is the second part of the Diuels prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on,
who hauing caried Christ from the
wildernes to Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, now he placeth him
vpon a pinnacle of the temple, or a litle wing
of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. Some think that it was a sharpe
broach gilded to some especiall vse: but it is
either the battlements which were made by
Gods commaundement, least any should
fall, because their houses had flat roofes, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:29110:41"/>
else some corner of the temple; howsoeuer,
it was a dangerous place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou be the sonne of God, cast thy selfe
downe, &amp;c.]</hi> In this verse is set downe the
second temptation, and in a syllogisme it
may be thus concluded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If thou be the sonne
of God, then cast thy selfe downe: but thou
sayest, and art perswaded that thou art the
sonne of God, therefore thou mayest cast
thy selfe downe.</p>
            <p>Here we must marke the scope of the
Diuell in this second temptation, which is
this, to tempt our sauiour Christ to presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to perswade him to presume of Gods
mercy, and to bring him to a vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his fathers protection, without
vsing lawfull meanes.</p>
            <p>And in this second temptation we may
obserue one especial thing,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> which the Diuel
aimes at in his temptations, namely, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him to a vaine presumption of Gods
mercy. And surely we see the diuel preuails
much in these days by this argument: for we
see how some men crie, God is mercifull,
God is mercifull, and so presume &amp; grow
secure in sinne, and take occasion of Gods
mercie to sooth themselues in their sins.
Others, they say, I am either elected or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29110:42"/>
and if I be elected, I am sure I shal
be saued howsoeuer I liue; if I be reiected
I am sure I shall perish, though I liue neuer
so well: and thus men liue as they list. Others
say, I know the Lord will prouide for me,
and therefore refuse to liue in any calling.
And as for those which make profession of
the Gospell, the Diuell he labours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them, that it is sufficient to professe
religion, though they practise not the duties
of religion: as the fiue foolish virgines,
who held out their blazing lampes, yet
wanted the vessel of oile to maintaine their
lampes.</p>
            <p>This being so,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> it should admonish vs al to
take especiall heed, that we be not ouer com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of Satan in this kind, seeing the Diuell kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
our nature, and seeth that to presume
and thinke well of our selues, it is a thing
very fitting and pleasing our nature: whereas
despaire, it is a troublesome thing, and
brings men often to a greater sight of their
misery: and the truth is, the Diuell preuailes
with a thousand to one more by presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then by despaire: despaire kils thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
securitie ten thousands.</p>
            <p>And it is to be noted, that when the
Diuell had in the former temptation la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29110:42"/>
to bring Christ to despaire of his
Fathers prouidence, now he labours the
cleane contrary, to bring him to presume
of Gods prouidence. And here we may see
the Diuels exceeding cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning, that he fought
to cary our Sauiour Christ from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
to another. And thus doth the Diuell
deale with all men, he seeks to draw men
either to presumption or else to despaire,
and labors to cary them from one extreame
to another, as from couetousnes to prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
and so of the rest. And therefore we
must labour to auoide both the extreames,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
neither to presume too much, nor yet to be
cast downe by despaire, but to keepe the
golden mediocritie, euen as Christ doth in
this place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cast thy selfe downe.]</hi> He would haue
Christ not to shew by his doctrine, but to
worke a miracle, that he may know him to
be the son of God. This shewes the nature of
all wicked men; they care not for the
doctrine of God, but they crie out for mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
as we may see in <hi>Herod,</hi> he desired to see
our Sauiour Christ worke some miracle, but
he contemned his word and doctrine. And
the Iewes who persecuted Christ and his
Gospel, yet when he was vpon the crosse,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29110:43"/>
they would haue him worke a miracle, to
come downe when he was nailed hand and
foote. And all wicked men are of the same
nature, more to regard and desire a miracle,
then to heare the blessed doctrine of Iesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cast thy selfe downe]</hi> The Diuel hauing
proued before the faith of Christ to be most
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant, that he would not so much as doubt
of his fathers prouidence in his greatest
need, now he takes occasion from the graces
and gifts of Christ to bring him to presume,
and to haue a vain confidence of his fathers
protection. And so wil the Diuel deale with
all the members of Christ; if he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
by our weaknesses to bring vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire,
then he wil take occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the graces
and gifts he sees in vs, to make vs presume: as
often he preuailes by this meanes to make
men swell and thinke highly of themselues
for some grace they haue receiued, of
learning, wit, eloquence, &amp;c. to puffe men vp
with satanicall pride and ouerweening o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

themselues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then cast thy selfe downe.]</hi> The Lord gaue
the Diuel permission to place Christ in a
dangerous place: but yet the Diuell coul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
not go any further to hurt Christ there; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

cast him downe he had no power, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
him to cast himselfe downe. Where
we see, the Diuels power is limited, his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is not so great as his malice is to mankind;
but the Lord doth limit Satans power, and
in all things hath care of his owne children,
that Satan can do them no harme. For the
Diuel, though he had set Christ vpon the top
of the temple, could not for his life cast him
downe; where we may see, the Diuell for all
his malice can go no further then God giues
him leaue. And this must comfort vs: for
as God the Father limits Satan in respect
of Christ our head, so doth he in vs his
members.</p>
            <p>Now followes the reason which the Diuel
vseth, the better to perswade Christ to yeeld
vnto his temptation: <hi>For it is written, he shall
giue his Angels charge ouer thee.</hi> When as the
Diuell heard our Sauiour Christ alleage
Scripture; he like an ape imitates Christ, and
begins to alleage Scripture roundly as wel
as he.<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> And therfore we must be wary how we
entertaine doctrines of heretikes, and false
teachers, though they seeme to proue them
by the Scriptures: for the Diuel he hath his
<hi>scriptum est,</hi> it is written, as ready as may be.
But we must learne to proue the spirits, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29110:44"/>
is, the doctrines of men, whether they be of
God or not, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1. lest the Diuel and
wicked men deceiue vs; for we see here how
the Diuel can alleage Scripture, and that
fitly for his purpose. And it is the subtil
practise of the diuel to alleage Scripture,
that so he may perswade men to receiue his
damnable doctrines, and become heretickes
and scismatickes. And to this end he doth
grosly abuse the Scriptures; yea when he
would perswade men to liue in sinne, he
hath his, <hi>Scriptum est,</hi> very ready, and can tel
them, <hi>At what time soeuer a sinner doth repent
him of his sinne, he shall haue mercie:</hi> and truly
by his abusing of Scripture he preuailes
with many.</p>
            <p>The wordes which the diuell alleageth
are taken out of the fourescore and eleuenth
Psalme, the eleuenth verse: <hi>For he shall giue
his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee in all
thy wayes, &amp;c.</hi> Now the Diuell in alleaging
and propounding the words is very precise,
and sheweth himselfe very carefull in repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the words: in so much as he will not
leaue out no not this particle <hi>[For]</hi> which
might well haue bene left out. Yet in the
end he stickes not to leaue out a whole
clause, which is the maine point and ground
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29110:44"/>
of Gods promise: namely, this: <hi>to keepe thee
in all thy wayes.</hi> Where we may see, how
the diuell doth most vil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly abuse the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God: and it is vsuall with him in
his allegations, to put in, or to put out
something, or some way or other to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue
them, or to corrupt the sense and
meaning of the Scriptures, to serue his owne
turne.</p>
            <p>And as this is the diuels manner in his
alleaging and dealing with the Scriptures,
so do the Papists as his scholers. For though
in word they hold the Scriptures, yet it is
vsuall with them to put in, or leaue out, or
by some meanes to corrupt and depraue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the sense and meaning, as might be she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
by example.</p>
            <p>Well, seeing the diuell is so skilfull in the
Scriptures, and can alleage them so readily
and so fitly for his purpose, and withall is so
malicious to mince them and depraue them,
it should make all men to studie the holy
Scriptures, that so we might be acquainted
with them, and be able to disclose and
to descry Satans fallations and subtilties:
and we should wish with <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Lords people could prophecie. But
especially the Ministers of the word, they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29110:45"/>
must labour to be thorowly acquainted with
the booke of God, to obserue euen the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the text, else the diuell will
cast a mist before their eyes, and beguile
them with his subtill fallations: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they must do as <hi>Ezechiel</hi> did, eate vp the
book of God.</p>
            <p>And that we might not perceiue Satans
subtilties and deceit, he labours to keepe
men in ignorance of the word, and by all
meanes to haue the Scriptures hid and
darke: and if it were possible, to root out the
schooles of learning, and that the Bible
might be burned. And as he preuailes in
Poperie, to bring men to this, that all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the Scriptures might hang on

in Poperie ground all vpon <hi>Lumbard</hi> the
maister of the Sentences, and barre the
common people from the Scriptures, lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them vp in an vnknowne tong: so with
Christians he taketh the like course, for he
perswades them, that the Scriptures are hard
to be vnderstood, and very obscure and
troublesome, and therfore he drawes men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> seeing the diuell can alleage the
word of God and say, <hi>It is written,</hi> and that
he can bring in Scripture fit for his purpose;
what a shame is it for Christians, if they do
not labor so to know the Scriptures of God,
that they may alleage them as occasion shall
serue: &amp; that not as some do, to heape place
vpon place without all reason, but to alleage
them fitly and to the purpose?</p>
            <p>Lastly, seeing this is a diuellish and satani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
practise, in alleaging the Scriptures to
depraue and corrupt them, to leaue out and

               <hi>He shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee]</hi>
The true sense of the place is this, that the
Lore had a speciall care of his people; and
when he sent any iudgement vpon the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
he gaue them this comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that in the middest of all their troubles
he himselfe would protect them. And as this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29110:46"/>
promise was made to them, so it is generall
to the whole Church of God, and belongs to
vs. For in all common iudgements and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
the children of God which walke in
his waies, shal be sure to haue protection and
securitie: for the Angels of God, by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
do hold them vp, as it were in
their hands. In which words there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
taken from nurses, who hauing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
committed to their care, do hold them
very charily and tenderly in their hands, and
dare not let them go out of their armes: euen
so the Angels of God by his appointment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
become euen as nurses to his children in all
their lawful wayes,<note place="margin">Vse 3. Psal. 34. 7.</note> and do attend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them,
and are very carefull to protect them from

            <p>It is true indeed, that iudgement begins at
the house of God, and he often afflicts his
dearest children to trie their faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
yet is is most certaine, that in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
calamities the children of God shall haue
protection and security: yea the Angels of

vilely Satan abuseth the word of God, he
alleageth another place of Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our Sauiour Christ answers the Diuell,
that it is true, God hath made sundry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
in his word, of protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his people,
but yet so, as if they refuse to walke in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of God, and to vse such lawfull
meanes as he prescribeth in his word, he is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29110:47"/>
not bound to perfome them, for they be
made vpon that condition,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe it is written,]</hi> Seeing our Sauior
Christ doth alleage another place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
to expound that the Diuel brought
against him, and to shew how he abused
Scripture: hence we gather, that the holy
Scriptures are of themselues sufficient to
interprete themselues,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> for so Christ allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
another text of scripture to expound
that which Satan alleageth, and to confute
his abusing of it.<note place="margin">Nehe. 8. 8.</note> So we find that <hi>Ezra</hi> did
expound the law of God, and giues the sense
of it by the scriptures, and so expounds the
one by the other, <hi>Nehem. 8. 9. (Iunius.)</hi> Now
if the seruants of God could do this in the
old Testament, how much more may we in
the new, wherein many things are most
plainely opened and expounded by Christ
and his Apostles?</p>
            <p>But the Papists cannot by any meanes
yeeld to this doctrin, for they hold, that that
which must interprete the scriptures, must
haue iudiciall power and authoritie to iudge
of the sense of the scriptures; but they hold
the scriptures are but a dumbe letter, and
therefore are not able to iudge of the sense
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d meaning of the scriptures. Yet for all that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:29110:47"/>
we see (by the example of our sauior Christ)
that the scriptures are of sufficient power to
giue the sense of the scriptures, to interprete
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, and to shew what is the true sense
of the scriptures, though they be dumbe.
And as we see, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may aswel shew his
mind to his friend by letters and writing, as
by word of mouth: euen so the Lord God
speakes now to his people by the scriptures,
as well as he did in olde time by his owne
liuely voice from heauen.</p>
            <p>But if the Papists will yet deny the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to haue power to iudge and determine
of the sense of the Scriptures; then would I
know, who hath this power giuen vnto him?
They answer, the church must giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and determine of the sense of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
but that is false, for the Lord hath not
giuen any such power to the Church, to
determine of the sense of the scriptures at
her pleasure, but only he hath giuen to the
ministery of the word, to open and expound
the scriptures by the scriptures the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. As
a Lawyer hath not that power to iudge of the
law of his Prince, and to giue what sense he
listeth, but onely to expound the law, and to
giue the sense of it by the words of the law,
and other circumstances co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the same.</p>

more authoritie to vnwritten verities then
to the written word of God? Nay onely the
scriptures must be the rule of faith, and only
the scriptures iudge and determine of the
sense of themselues.</p>
            <p>2 Neither is the consent of Fathers a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
rule to giue iudgement, and to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of the sense of the scriptures: for we
know that they being men, and many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(hauing not the knowledge of Hebrew and
Greeke, yea and most of all in expounding
the word) are subiect to error, and sometimes
do erre. And by the same reason the Pope is
no meete man to be the iudge of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and to determine what should be the
sense of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, seeing he is subiect to manifold
errors, and many Popes haue erred in the
foundations of Religion.</p>
            <p>Now follow the words of Christs answer,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29110:48"/>
taken out of <hi>Deut. 6. 16. Thou shalt not tempt
the Lord thy God.</hi> First we must search what
this word, <hi>to tempt,</hi> signifies: secondly, the
maner how God is said to be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted: thirdly
the cause and root of this tempting of God.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">VVhat it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to tempt God.</note> To tempt God, is to proue or to
make trial whether God be such a one as the
scriptures report him to be: namely, whether
he be so iust, so mercifull, so mightie as the
word of God describes him to be. So the
Propet <hi>Dauid</hi> expounds it, <hi>Psal. 95. 9. Your
fathers tempted me, and proued me in the desert.</hi>
Where to tempt, is to proue Gods iustice
and mercie, whether he were so iust and
mercifull as the word sets him out to be, and
as he promised to be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the manner, it is not simply
to tempt and to make triall of God, but to
tempt God, is to make needlesse triall of
Gods power &amp;c. when we haue no cause to
try the Lord: and so it is taken here in the
words of Christ, <hi>Thou shalt not tempt,</hi> that is,
thou shalt not take needlesse and vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
experience and triall of Gods power
and goodnesse.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the cause which moueth men to
tempt God, is a distrustfull and vnbeleeuing
heart, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> want of faith. So the Israelites te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29110:49"/>
God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. ver. 18. 22. They tempted
God in their hearts, and required meate for
their lust. And the reason is, vers. 22. because
they did not beleeue in God, and did not
trust in his helpe, because they did not relye
vpon his care and fatherly prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: so that
vnbeleefe was the roote of this their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of God.</p>
            <p>So then to tempt God, is to make needlesse
and vnnecessarie triall and experience of his
mercie, goodnesse, power and iustice, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from a distrusting heart.</p>
            <p>Now God may be tempted fiue maner of
wayes.<note place="margin">Hovv God is tempted.</note> First, when men will take vpon them
to appoint God the time when, the place
where, and the maner how God must helpe
them, and accomplish his promise to them.
Thus the Israelites in the wildernes wanting
water,<note place="margin">Exod. 17. 7.</note> they say: <hi>Is the Lord amongst it vs or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shewing, that through the Lord had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
he would be with them, yet vnlesse he
would at that time giue them water in their
need, they would not giue credit to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
Againe, <hi>Psal. 78. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
still shewing, that vnlesse the Lord would at
their pleasures, &amp; now presently send them
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29110:49"/>
meate, they were readie to distrust his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.</p>
            <p>And therefore it must admonish vs,<note place="margin">Vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> that
we must not in our requests and petitions (as
the Bethulianes did) appoint God the time,<note place="margin">Iudith. 7. 30</note>
place, or meanes how we would be helped
in pouertie, sicknesse, or other waies; but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in prayer, waite vpon the Lords ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and leaue these circumstances to his
good will and pleasure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is tempted, when men will
not beleeue his word, but do demaund signes
and wonders from heauen, as the Scribes and
Pharises did <hi>(Ioh. 2. 18.)</hi> tempt our Sauiour
Christ, not beleeuing his doctrine, vnlesse he
would confirme it by some miracle. And
thus all they tempt God, who refuse to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the doctrine of God, because it is not
confirmed vnto them at their pleasure by
signes and wonders.</p>
            <p>But some may say:<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> What, is it not lawfull
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to demaund and require a signe at Gods
hands?<note place="margin">Answer.</note> Yes we may sometimes: and so we
reade that <hi>Gedeon</hi> did require a signe of God
and sinned not:<note place="margin">Iud. 6. 36. 37.</note> so did <hi>Hezechiah. 2.
King.</hi> 20. 8.</p>
            <p>In two cases men may aske a signe of
the Lord. First, when the Lord giues a man
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29110:50"/>
commaundement to aske a signe, then we
may aske it lawfully: and thus the Lord bid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Achaz</hi> to ask a signe,<note place="margin">Isai. 7. 11. 12.</note> and he sinned in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to do it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a man may aske a signe of God,
when it is necessarie for the confirmation of
a man in some extraordinarie calling: as we
see in <hi>Gedeon</hi> being extraordinarily appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God to be the Captaine and deliuerer
of Gods people; he being not fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of this his vocation, desired a signe of
God, not of infidelitie, but the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
himselfe of Gods calling him to that
busines. And so it was in <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
himselfe of Gods extraordinarie deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
from an extraordinarie di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ease.</p>
            <p>The third way whereby men tempt God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is when men liue in sinne continually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance, and so will trie Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
and thus the Israelites tempted God,
<hi>Num.</hi> 14. 18. And so all those which liue in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inne from day to day without repentance,
do indeed tempt God and abuse his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>And therefore seeing that this is euen to
tempt God,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to liue in sinne without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
it must stirre vs vp all to take heed how
we runne on in sinne: but that we do wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:29110:50"/>
speed repent and breake off the course of
our sins: for so long as we liue in sinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance, we tempt God, and then we
can promise no safetie to our selues, neither
looke for the protection of Gods Angels,
but ly euen naked to all Gods heauie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The fourth manner of tempting God, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
to inioyne men the obseruations of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
lawe, as it appeareth <hi>Ast.</hi> 15. 10. the
Iewes are said to tempt God, in that they
vrged the obseruation of the ceremonies of
<hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by this we may iudge of the present
estate of the Church of Rome, and of their
religion; which stands for the most part in
vaine and superstitious ceremonies; and that
which is worse, of Iudaisme and Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisme.</p>
            <p>The last way how men tempt God, is, not
to vse the lawfull &amp; ordinarie means which
God hath appointed, either concerning
mens soules, or concerning their bodies:
and this is here vnderstood in this place,
when Christ saith: <hi>Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God.</hi> When we shal refuse such law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and ordinarie meanes as the Lord hath
appointed, and vse extraordinarie; euen
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29110:51"/>
as a man hauing a readie way ouer a bridge,
should leaue that, and thrust himselfe into
the water, what were this but to tempt God?
Or when a man hath the ordinarie way to
come downe by the steppes or staires, and
refusing that shold cast himselfe downe from
the top of a steeple? So those men who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
the word of God, and will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to heare, what do they else but euen
tempt God; seeing they refuse the preaching
of the word, which is the ordinarie meanes
to saue mens soules?</p>
            <p>And thus Satan tempted our Sauiour
Christ to tempt God. For hauing now set
him on the toppe of the temple, in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
place, he perswades him to cast himselfe
downe: and he addeth, that he may be bold
to do so, because God hath giuen his Angels
charge to looke vnto him, that he take no
harme. But our Sauiour Christ answers him;
That were to tempt God, seeing he had the
lawfull and ordinary way to go downe by
the staires, and therefore he had no reason to
cast himselfe downe.</p>
            <p>In a word, all those tempt God, which
either refuse the ordinary meanes God hath
appointed, or do wilfully cast themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
daunger, being not called thereunto of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29110:51"/>
God: as <hi>Peter</hi> hauing no calling of God,
went and thrust himselfe into <hi>Caiphas</hi> hall, to
see what became of his maister: &amp; the three
Worthies which ventured through the
hoast of the Philistims to fetch water at the
well of Bethell for <hi>Dauid,</hi> whereas he might
haue had it without danger at home.</p>
            <p>Here some may aske, What we are to
iudge of those which vse to walke on ropes
on high places, and on the toppe of houses:
whether do such men sin or not? <hi>Ans.</hi> These
men do so either with a calling or without a
calling, Such as do it by vertue of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
calling, as Mosons and such as build
churches and houses, and so by reason of
their trades work on high places, cannot be
said to tempt God: nay rather so long as they
walke faithfully in their lawfull callings, they
may assure themselues of Gods blessing and
his protection.</p>
            <p>But as for those who to shew their agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie;
and to make sport, walke on ropes, or
runne vpon the roofe of houses, these men
hauing no calling from God so to do, they
cannot looke for Gods protection; nay, they
in so doing tempt God, casting themselues
vpon daunger. And our Sauiour Christ
might a thousand times better haue done
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29110:52"/>
this which Satan wold haue him here to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
yet would he not put himselfe into needlesse
daunger, lest he should tempt God; much
lesse ought any man else aduenture to do it.</p>
            <p>And in this, that our Sauiour Christ vseth
the ordinarie way, euen the staires, we may
learne, that if any man looke to haue Gods
protection and blessing, he must also make
sure to vse the lawfull and ordinarie meanes
appointed of God, &amp; keepe himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compasse of his calling: yea if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to find comfort in any of Gods gracious
promises, we must be wary to keepe our
selues within the compasse of his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements:
but if we leaue them, then we find
no true comfort, neither haue we any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of protection from God. But so long as
we walke in obedience of Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
and within the compasse of our
callings, we haue this blessed promise from
God, that his Angels shall take the care of
vs, to guard and to defend vs.</p>

               <hi>Againe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse. 8.</note> 
               <hi>the diuell taketh him into an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
high mountaine.]</hi> In the seuen verses
going before, we haue heard of the two first
temptations of our sauior Christ; now follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
the third. In this third temptation we
are to consider againe three especial points
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29110:52"/>
first, the preparation of the Diuel, ver. 8. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it selfe, ver. 9. Thirdly,
Christ his answer, ver. 10.</p>
            <p>And first of all seeing the Diuell doth thus
arme himselfe,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> and comes prepared three
times, in three seuerall temptations, it should
teach vs all on our parts to prepare our selues
continually, and to be ready to resist his
temptations.</p>
            <p>In the Diuels preparation note two parts:
first, he taketh him to an exceeding high
monntaine: secondly, he shewes him all the
kingdomes of the world, and the glorie of
them.</p>
            <p>But how could the Diuel cary our Sauiour
Christ to this high mountaine?<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> I answer,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> he
might do it two wayes: first, by vision: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
by reall transporting of his body from
Ierusalem to this mountaine. Some thinke
that this was onely in visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but I rather thinke
our Sauiour Christ was caried locally and
really; for our Sauiour Christ his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are not imaginary, but true and reall
temptations; and the words import no lesse,
but that he was really and locally transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the citie to the mountaine.</p>
            <p>The reasons why the Diuell caried our
Sauiour Christ to the mountaine, are these:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29110:53"/>
First, because the Diuell in all things desire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to imitate God, and to become as it were
Gods ape. Now we reade, that the Lord cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Moses</hi> to the mount Nebo,<note place="margin">Deut. 34. 1.</note> to shew him
all the land of Canaan; so the Diuell to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
God, and by imitating God, to match
him, and so to disgrace the Lord, carieth our
Sauior Christ to the mountaine, as it is likely,
to imitate Gods dealing with <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Diuell caried our Sauiour
Christ to this high mountaine, as a most fit
and conuenient place to broach this his third
and last temptation now in hand.</p>
            <p>In that the Diuell doth carie our Sauiour
Christ from Ierusalem to this hill locally;
hence we learne, that he may by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
haue like power ouer the deare chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, not once, but twise, nay thrise,
&amp; oftentimes. We see this true in our sauior
Christ the head: therefore if the Lord permit
Satan, and by his permission giue the Diuell
libertie to transport our bodies from place
to place, we must not be discouraged. Seeing
the same thing befell the head, it may also
befall his members, which we are.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second part of the Diuels preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
is this, that <hi>he shewes him all the kingdomes of
the world, &amp;c.</hi> Now concerning this, we may
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:29110:53"/>
not think the Diuell could do this in deed
and truth, to shew Christ all the seuerall
kingdomes of the world, as they be here pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
vpon earth, for that is a thing impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
for there is no hill so high, that a man
might see them all. Nay, if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were as high
as the Sunne, and could see neuer so clearely,
yet he could but see the one halfe of the
earth; and therefore we must know, he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
them in a counterfeit vision.</p>
            <p>Now these visions of the Diuell, they be
either of the outward senses, or else of the
vnderstanding. Of the outward senses, as the
delusions of the Diuel, making men thinke
they see that they do not see indeed. So the
Diuel is said to shew <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in his proper habite: and this was indeed
but a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfet <hi>Samuel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 28.</note> not that true <hi>Samuel,</hi>
who rested in the graue concerning his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and remained in heauen concerning his
soule.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there be false visions and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the vnderstanding; as the Lord
speaketh,<note place="margin">Zach. 13. 4.</note> that he will make the false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ashamed of their lying visions. And
some of these visions come vnto men slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
called dreames. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1. some come
waking, as to such as haue their braine
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29110:54"/>
crased, they oftentimes haue visions, and
thinke themselues to be Kings or Prophets,
as <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> &amp;c. Now concerning this
vision of Christ offered by the Diuell, he did
it not onely to the mind of Christ, but also to
his out ward eye, and visibly.</p>
            <p>By this practise of the Diuell we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his wonderfull skill and power, in that
he can resemble to the outward senses in
such a strange manner, euen as he listeth, so
great and wonderfull matters. And the like is
done by Magicians and Coniurers, who by
the helpe of the diuel, can reueale and shew
things done in a farre countrey, or things
that be lost, in a glasse: or for things long pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
can resemble them to outward sense in
a glasse, or in the aire. So that those are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
who are of mind, that they cannot do
this: for if the diuell could shew Christ all the
kingdomes of the world and the glorie of
them in so short a time, then much more can
he shew some one particular thing to the eye
and sense of man.</p>
            <p>Now let vs marke the diuels drift in this
temptation, &amp; setting before Christs eyes
this goodly and glorious sight: sure it was to
this end, that the diuell might by this meanes
more easily wind himselfe into the heart of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29110:54"/>
Christ: and therefore he sets this thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his eyes, that Christ might be moued by
them, and take some delight in them, and
delighting in them might desire them, and
so Satan might in the end ouercome him
and insnare him.</p>
            <p>And this hath bene the auncient practise
of the diuell, as <hi>Genes.</hi> 3. first, to moue <hi>Evah</hi>
to cast her eye vpon the apple, to marke the
beautie of it, then to like it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to desire and
lust after it, and so in the end to tast of it. And
thus he dealt with Christ: first, he shewes this
glorious sight, and the beautie of all these
things, that if he could, he might haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him to desire them, and so make his
temptation take place.</p>
            <p>Seeing this is Satans auncient subtiltie,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> it
must warne vs to take great heed of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
senses, especially the two senses of
learning, namely, seeing and hearing. The
eyes and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ares be the two windowes of
the Soule: and if the diuell can get in his
head there, he will easily wind in all his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and poison our soules.</p>
            <p>We had need therefore to counterguard
our hearts,<note place="margin">Prou. 4. 23.</note> to keepe them with all diligence,
euen aboue al watch and ward, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
to take heed who, &amp; what enters into
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29110:55"/>
our eyes and eares, and to make sure w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
keep carefull watch at those doores. We mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
pray with <hi>Dauid:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 119. 37.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord set a Watch before
my mouth, and keepe the doore of my lippes:</hi> and
with holy <hi>Iob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 31. 1.</note> make a couenant with our
eyes that they behold no vanitie. This if we
do, death shall not enter in by these doores
and windowes, but we shall preserue our
soules in puritie.</p>
            <p>Now when the diuell shewes our Sauiour
Christ this goodly shew, let vs mark the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
he shewes Christ all the beautie, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and delight of them: not the troubles,
vexations, calamities and daungers of them.
And thus will the diuel deale with vs; if he
would tempt any one to some sinne, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shewes but hides the miserie &amp; daunger,
the curses and calamities that will ensue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that sinne: but he shewes the profit, gaine,
pleasure, delight and commoditie that that
sinne will affoord them: that by this meane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
he may bring them to his bow, and moue
them headlong to rush into the commiting
of sinne. Indeed when he hath got his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and preuailed thus farre to bring a man
into sin, then he will lay it open in most vgly
maner, and lay before a poore sinner the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and punishment due to his sinne, that so
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29110:55"/>
he may make a poore sinner breake the
necke of his soule in despaire.</p>
            <p>Further, marke how the cunning diuell
shewed not these goodly and glorious sights
in the first or second temptation, but reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them for the last, and that in great subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
For the diuell know very well, that if any
would peruaile, then surely the desire of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
of preferment, of profit and pleasure,
would moue the heart of Christ.</p>
            <p>And in this subtiltie he shewes, that this
is a most daungerous temptation which
comes from the right hand, that is, which
proceeds from profit, pleasure, preferment
and honour. And by this temptation he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
more against <hi>Dauid,</hi> then he could
when he was in great conflict, and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Saule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So prosperitie and ease in the Primitiue
Church in the dayes of <hi>Constantine,</hi> did more
preuaile with Christians, then persecution
and tribulation could do for the space of
three hundred yeares before. And those
which could be moued by no other meanes,
yet the hope of honor, profite and pleasure
hath ouercome and preuailed with them.
Thus ease slayeth the foolish: prosperitie is
as a slipperie way: and few hauing rest are
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29110:56"/>
edified, and walk in the feare of the Lord, &amp;
the comfort of the holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke</hi> cap. 4. 5. he addeth the circumstance
of time, that the diuell shewed all this to
Christ in a point or moment of time, in so
short a time as possibly might be, with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous
speed &amp; celeritie. And this the diuell
did being subtill, the more to inflame th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
heart of Christ to desire them: and therefore
he set his wares open, and as it were in a
glimpse gaue him the beholding of the
beauty of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So we see, if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> see some st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and beautifull thing, and haue but a blush or

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
so he would haue dealt with our Sauiour
Christ, he would haue affected his hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with this sudden and glorious spectacle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now followeth the temptation it selfe, in
these words:</hi> And said vnto him, All these
will I giue thee,<note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> if thou wilt fall downe &amp; worship
me.</p>
            <p>In this temptation we must first marke the
scope and drift of the diuell therein. In the
first temptation he laboured to tempt Christ
to distrust and vnbeleefe: in the second, to
puffe him vp with vaine confidence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption:
now in this third, he tempted
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29110:56"/>
Christ to commit idolatrie, euen to worship
the Diuell.</p>
            <p>And truly this hath euer bene the practise
of the Diuell, to seeke to ouerturne religion
and good conscience by these three things,
honour, profite, and pleasures. Among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
and Protestant Ministers he hath
preuailed much by these meanes. When as
for the Ministers of the word, many haue in
hope of profit and preferment, forsaken true
religion &amp; cleane abiured it, and taught the
cleane contrarie, euen that which the papists
hold and teach: so we see that protestant
Merchants for hope of gaine, do carrie ouer
to the Church of Rome all such merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
of waxe, &amp;c. as the Papistes vse to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their superstitions and Idolatrie.</p>
            <p>And among common Professors, many of
them to saue their lands, liuings, and places,
haue chaunged as religion hath changed;
now Papists, now Protestants, like to Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
into any colour. Of this we had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes: few great
men remained Protestants, but yeeded to
the Idolatrie of those times.</p>
            <p>This third temptation hath two parts: first,
a promise: secondly, a condition. And here
the Diuell saith not: I will procure thee
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29110:57"/>
these things at Gods hands; but in his own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
name, <hi>I will giue thee, all these,</hi> to make Chrit
depend vpon him for them, to trust in him,
and to deny his confidence in God, and to
relie vpon the diuell for an inheritance in
this world.</p>
            <p>In which vile practise of the diuell, we may
behold his shamelesse boldnesse, who dares
offer Christ the gift of all these, conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if he would worship him: whereas indeed
they did all most properly belong to Iesus
Christ himselfe, and were his owne; neither
had Satan any title to them, but onely by
vsurpation.</p>
            <p>And as the diuel here with Christ, so
he dealeth with most men of the world, to
tempt them to depend vpon him for the
wealth of the world, and to make the Diuell
their God. For though me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deny this in word,
and say, All they haue, God hath sent it, they
thanke God: yet their wicked practises shew
the contrarie, that they do indeed depend
vpon the diuell for gaine and profite: seeing
most men get their goods by false waight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and measures, by deceit, fraud, cousinage, by
lying, swearing &amp; forswearing. Now while
they get that they haue thus by such vile and
wicked meanes, it plainly shewes that all
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29110:57"/>
they haue, they haue it of the Diuell, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon him for wealth, &amp; so make him
their God, though in word they deny it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so much.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Diuell knew Christ was a
King, and that his kingdome was not of this
world, but spirituall, exercised especially in
mens consciences: now the Diuel he labours
to tempt Christ to become an earthly King,
which if it had taken place in Christ, he knew
then that he could not be that true Messiah,
who should raigne spriritually in mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</p>
            <p>And in like maner deales the Diuell with
the members of Christ: for the church of
God hath a kingdome, and that is spiritual
in the word of God. Now the stewardship is
the dispensation and ministery of the word
preached, and against this the Diuell labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that it may become an earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
not spirituall but carnall, not in the
power of the spirit, but in the carnall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of mans eloquence; and so by all
means to ouerturne the true kingdome of
Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we see here how the Diuell
maketh very large and liberall promises,
though he meant to performe nothing,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:29110:58"/>
neither could he though he would.</p>
            <p>This must teach vs to study that we may
be contrary to the Diuel, and therefore that
we do warily consider what promises we
make, whether the thing we promise be
lawfull, and in our owne power, and that
we do it with sincere harts, voide of deceit,
and with purpose to be as good as our word:
and when we haue promised, accordingly to
performe our promise;<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 4.</note> for that is a marke
of Gods children,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 25.</note> and a fruite of the
spirit and true faith, in doing the duties of
equitie.</p>
            <p>And in that the Diuel shewed all these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, euen the seuerall kingdomes of the
world, it is manifest he knew them all, and
was well acquainted, and had trauelled
through them, as he confesseth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 7. And
in that he could shew the chiefest glory and
beautie of them in such a short time, it is
cleare he was cunning in them, and the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
estates and conditions of them all.</p>
            <p>And we see, that the Diuel in propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all these glorious kingdomes vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
Christ, he did tempt him to ambition, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
he would set his heart on them and so desir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
them. And herein note one of his most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
practises, which is the ouerturning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:29110:58"/>
kingdomes: for the Diuell desireth to do the
greatest harme and most mischiefe that he
can. Now in the ouerthrow of a kingdome,
many go to wracke; and to effect this, he
seekes continually to puffe men vp with
ambition, that they may desire and gape for
preferment and honor. The Lord hath in
mercy placed ouer vs in this kingdome a
gracious Prince and a Christian Queene, &amp;
the Diuell hath long enuied this our pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie,
and sought sundry by-plots and
manifold practises to ouerthrowe our state,
to cut off the head, and to cast her crowne
into the dust. And to this purpose he hath
raised vp many wicked and rebellious sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects:
but the Lord hath in mercie brought
all to nought. And therefore the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of this should moue vs all to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
for this great mercie of God in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
both Prince and people, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to nought all such rebellious wretches,
confounding those ambitious heads, and all
their vile and trecherous plots and deuices:
and we must shew this thankfulnesse in the
duties of repentance and sincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this must teach vs to pray vnto
God continually, for the preseruation of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29110:59"/>
our Prince and kingdome, that he would
euermore confound and bring to nought all
Satans policies, and vile plots and practises
of ambitious heads. And it is our duty, in
token of true ioy and thankfulnesse, to do as
the people did in the dayes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who
shouted so loud, and cried out <hi>God saue king
Salomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Kin 1. 4.</note> that the very earth rang againe: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
so should all true Christians, to expresse the
ioy of our hearts, pray day and night, God
saue Queene Elizabeth.</p>
            <p>And herein is our comfort, that though
the Diuell with all his malice seekes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
both Prince and people, and the whole
kingdome, and hath his wicked instruments
to effect the same: yet the Lord God hath
his Angels which take care of his Church
and people, and stand round about them, to
defend them both by sea and by land, that all
the Diuels in hell cannot hurt them: but the
Angels of God defend his children at home,
and beate back all our enemies from inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All these will I giue thee]</hi> These words are
the very words of the Pope of Rome, who as
Satans vicar, hath indeed the two hornes of
the lambe, but he speakes like the Dragon:
he makes himselfe equall to God, he can (as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:29110:59"/>
he sayth) send to heauen and to hel, set vp
and pul downe Princes, he can do what he
list, he can open and shut at his pleasure, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
sinnes, and I know not what: which she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
he speakes the Diuels language, the
language of Ashdod, not of Canaan.</p>
            <p>Luke. 4. 6. <hi>The Diuell ads a reason further
to perswade Christ: for he saith,</hi> All these
kingdoms are mine, and I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue them to whom
I will.</p>
            <p>Where first the Diuell tels a loud lie, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
to himselfe the right of all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the world: for it is the Lord his
right alone, as we may see <hi>Dan. 4. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> where
the Lord speakes to that proud king <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar</hi>
by the ministerie of <hi>Daniel: I
beare rule ouer the kingdomes, &amp; I alone (sayth
the Lord God) can giue them to whom I please.</hi>
So then the Diuell hath no power to giue
them, neither hath any title to them, that he
can bestow them at his pleasure: no, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to God alone: yet we see Satan will be
an vsurper at large.</p>
            <p>Secondly, marke the Diuels arrogancie
and shamelesse boasting, in that he dares
chalenge all the kingdomes of the earth to
himselfe, as though he were soueraigne
Lord of them, to do with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at his pleasure.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:29110:60"/>
And let vs all learne by this shamelesse lying
and notorious boasting of the diuel, to take
heed that we be not like him in these sinnes,
but study to be contrary to him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must desire and study to speake the
truth at all times, and take heed of boasting
yea rather let vs thinke as humbly and basely
of our selues as possibly we can, which is a
good meanes to humble and cast downe our
proud hearts: and let such know that are
giuen to these sins, to lying and vaine boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this and that which they haue not, it
argues great pride, and shewes they be very
like the Diuell himselfe in this point.</p>

               <hi>If thou wilt fall downe and worship me.]</hi>
Here is the second part of the temptation:
namely, the condition, and the maine drift
of the Diuell in these words, is to bring our
Sauiour Christ to manifest Idolatrie, euen to
worship the Diuell himselfe.</p>
            <p>First, seeing the Diuell durst be so bold to
tempt our sauiour Christ to Idolatrie, and to
worship himself; he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we see that the maine
scope of the Diuel is especially to deface Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the true seruice and worship of
God, and therefore he assaults the Church of
God, and tempts men to bring them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
heresies, schismes, idolatry, that he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:29110:60"/>
might destroy the church of God: and thus
he became a lying spirit in the mouth of
foure hundred false prophets at one time.<note place="margin">1. King. 22.</note>
And when <hi>Iehosuah</hi> the high Priest came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Temple to performe the worship of
God,<note place="margin">Zach. 3. 1.</note> he stood vp to hinder him, when he
was praying for the good of the Church.
And so doth he in these dayes stand vp and
seeke by all meanes to hinder Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in the building vp of Gods Church.
When Christ hath sowne good wheate,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Diuell soweth tares; and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> would
haue gone to preach the Gospell to the
Thessalonians,<note place="margin">1. Thess 2. 18</note> the Diuell hindred him; and
it is his speciall study to stop the ministery of
the Gospell: and therefore it is said that the
Diuell cast many of Gods ministers into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>Reuel.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reu.</hi> 16. 13. 14. there came 3 euill and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
spirits out of the mouth of the beast,
which entred into Kings houses, to turne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
from the entertaining of the Gospell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that Kings be either especiall nurses to
the Gospell, or else if Satan can preuaile
with them, become greatest enemies
to hinder the course of the Gospel. Such
frogges be these Seminarie Priests, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
Friers, and popish Iesuits, which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29110:61"/>
lurke commonly in Kings courts, and in the
places of mighty men.</p>
            <p>Then seeing the Diuell is so painefull to
stop the course of the Gospell, to ouerturne
true religion &amp; the seruice of God: it must
stirre vp all the Ministers of the word of
God, to labour and take paines, that their
diligence in defending and vpholding true
religion, and building the church of God,
may counteruaile Satans diligence in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it behooueth all Christians not
onely to pray for themselues, but seeing the
Diuell labours the ruine of the church, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in preuailing with Princes and great
men, we must pray for the good of Gods
Church and children, and euery member of
it: by name, for Kings &amp; Queens, &amp;c &amp; good
reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is there that we should do so: for in the
good and flourishing estate of the church we
all receiue benefite by it, and fare the better
for it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if Satan durst set vpon the Sonne
of God, and tempt him to idolatrie and to
worship the Diuell, then much more will he
be tempting vs to the like sinne, and set vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
sinfull man to moue him to worship him, and
make him his God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:29110:61"/>
But you will say,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> there is none so mad to
worship the diuell, to make him our God: oh
we defie him.</p>
            <p>True it is,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> men say they defie the Diuell,
and spit at him, but alas if we consider their
dealings, we shall see the Diuell sits in their
hearts, and rules there as God. Do but cast
your eye vpon the three maine Religions
of the world, the religion of the Turke,
of the Iew, and of the Papist; and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
that most men worship the Diuell and
make him their God: because the Turke he
is ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the true God: the Iew worships
God the Father, but not by Iesus Christ,
whom they deny: the Papist worships a
false and counterfeit Christ forged by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and neuer read of in the word of God:
for they make him a Sauior in part, &amp; a Priest
to be creator, or the maker of his Creator.</p>
            <p>That it may appeare, that these three sorts
of people do not worship the true God, but
euen the diuell himselfe, let vs marke these
2 principles. First, that al doctrines set downe
and inuented by man, concerning Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
and worship, being against the word of
God, they be the doctrines of Diuels: so
saith <hi>Paule 1. Tim.</hi> 4. 1. 3. that there shall
come false teachers, which shall teach doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29110:62"/>
of Diuels: and what are these? <hi>Vers.</hi> 3.
he saith: Such as forbid to marrie: and teach
men that some meates be holy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
&amp; some vnholy and not lawfull to be
eaten. The second principle is this, all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God deuised by man, being against
the word of God, is the doctrine of Diuels.
So the Gentiles offering to Idols <hi>Paule</hi> saith
they offered to Diuels:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Cor 10. 22</note> yet none of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that, but rather by the idols offered
to God. So whatsoeuer worship shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented,
being against the word of God, it
is indeed the worship of the Diuell, not of
God.</p>
            <p>Now by these two principles it appeareth,
that the worship of God performed by the
Turkes, and by the Iewes, it is no worship
of God, but the worship of Diuels: seeing
both of them worship the Father out of the
Sonne. And the worship of God in Poperie,
it is no better then the worship of the Diuel,
seeing they worship God out of the true
Christ, and haue forged to themselues a false
counterfeit Christ. And if <hi>Paule</hi> might tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirme of the Gentiles, that they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
not the true God, but offered to diuels:
then mnch more may it be auouched of that
abominable sacrifice of the Masse, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29110:62"/>
it is indeed the worship of the diuell, seeing
it is more vile idolatrie then that of the
Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Now it will be said:<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> Though the Diuell
preuaile thus with them, yet he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
so with Protestants, neither can they be
said to worship the diuell.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> I answer: That in
truth there be thousands of Protestants in
the world who do worship the Diuel: for
all those which do onely in outward shew
professe true religion, but in heart loue the
world, set their hearts vpon pleasures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
and preferments, such professours do in
truth make the diuell their God, and may
be said to worship the Diuell. For to whom
soeuer they giue their hearts, to them they
do giue worship: but while they set their
hearts on these things, they do not loue God
neither do they beleeue in God, and rest
vpon him as their God; and therefore they
make the world their God, and so worship
the Diuell.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, by this practise of the diuell, we
see those men confuted, who thinke that the
diuell cannot make a league with men, as
with witches, coniurers, &amp;c. For we reade
and know such things haue bin done, and
here we haue a manifest proofe of it: for the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29110:63"/>
Diuell offers a league to Christ: there was
nothing wanting but our Sauiour Christ his
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent. And if sinfull ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had bene in Christs
stead, questionlesse there had bene a league<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and for so great gaine he would haue the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
his seruice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then said Iesus vnto him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Auoide Satan,
&amp;c.]</hi> Now followeth the answer of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ. And first in Christs answer
marke, in propounding of it he vseth first a
speech of indignation and of defiance to the
Diuell and his offer: <hi>Auoide Satan:</hi> as though
Christ should haue said: I haue heard thee
blaspheme both me and my Father, &amp; haue
thus long suffered thee, but I will suffer thee
no longer, get thee hence Satan, I will not
vouchsafe to answer to thy temptations any
more.</p>
            <p>Marke here in the answer of Christ, that
he was content to endure the diuels tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and reproches, which concerned his
owne person: but when he is so bold to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
God his Father, he can endure him
no longer. Now when he makes challenge
and claimes title to all the kingdoms of the
world, as though he were Lord of them, and
could bestow them at his pleasure, therin he
blasphemed God his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:29110:63"/>
Then this teacheth vs,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that if we shall heare
vngodly wretches blaspheme the name of
God, we may not endure it, but haue indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
&amp; great dislike of it. And if we heare
black-mouthed <hi>Rabshekahs</hi> blaspheme the
holy name of God, by swearing, cursing, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we must be touched with griefe, to
heare the glorious name of our God disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
and if time and place require, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
our dislike in open reprehension of it.
Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezabel</hi> being both wicked,
heard that <hi>Naboth</hi> had blasphemed God,
they rent their cloathes in token of sorrow.
So when <hi>Hezechiah</hi> heard the blasphemies
of <hi>Rabshekah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Kin. 19. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> he rent his cloths and was
very much grieued for it. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Dauid</hi> heard
the Gentiles say,<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 3.</note> where is now their God?
this blasphemous speech did greatly affect
him, so as his very teares were his drinke.
And the bad speeches of the men of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
did much affect <hi>Lot,</hi> &amp; vexe his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
soule, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
            <p>And as all men must be grieued to heare
wicked men blaspheme the name of God, so
especially those that be gouernours of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and by name, maisters of families: as
<hi>Dauid</hi> saith <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. he would not suffer a
talebearer in his house, much lesse a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:29110:64"/>
And the Magistrate is especially bound
to looke to this, seeing it is the law of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the blasphemer should be stoned to
death: now this law is perpetuall. And if a
man for speaking a word of disgrace against
the person of the Prince wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
shall iustly lose his life: then he that
is a blasphemer, and speakes to the disgrace
of the eternall God, is much more worthie
to die a thousand deaths.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, by this answer of Christ, we
learne how to behaue our selues when any
shall go about to perswade vs to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his Church, to renounce true religion; we
must accompt of them in that respect as the

we must hereby learne how to answer the

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:29110:64"/>
when his temptations be more mild, we may
reply by the word of God, yet when Satan
shall be more violent in his assaults, we must

            <p>
               <hi>It is written]</hi> Seeing our Sauior Christ now
the third time answers the Diuell by the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,

            <p>This confutes the Papists, who make
two Scriptures, one vnwritten and inward,
which is traditions, the consent of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which haue liued in all ages; &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

do make their vnwritten scriptures, as they

here, to be the most powerfull meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

<hi>It is written,</hi> we learne how to behaue

though we cannot answer their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but they set such a colour on them by

               </gap>

               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:29110:65"/>
               <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God only,]</hi>
In these words is contained the answer of
our sauiour Christ to the third temptation of
the Diuell. The words are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of <hi>Deut. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
13.</hi> where they are read thus, <hi>Thou shalt feare
the Lord thy God, and serue him.</hi> Now there
may seeme to be some difference in the
words, as they be alleaged by Christ: for in
that place of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> it is said, Thou
shalt feare the Lord thy God: our sauiour
Christ saith, Thou shalt worship. Againe, our
sauiour Christ addes a word, which is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>Moses</hi> in that place, namely, Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God <hi>onely:</hi> this
word <hi>onely</hi> is not in that text of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we vnderstand two points concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the alleaging of scripture, there will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to be no difference; the first is this, that
Christ and his Apostles in their alleaging of
scripture, do not so much sticke to the very
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>illables, as aime at the sense of the scriptures
which they alleage. The second thing is
this, that our sauiour Christ in alleaging
scripture, seekes to expound scripture, and
to open it in alleaging of it; and so doing, he
may well adde a word, when as the word
he addeth maketh much for the meaning of
the text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:29110:66"/>
And thus Christ in this place chaungeth
the word, not mistaking of it, but rather to
expound <hi>Moses;</hi> for whereas <hi>Moses</hi> saith,
<hi>Thou shalt feare the Lord,</hi> he meaneth that
religious feare whereby we feare God, and
worship him. Now our sauiour Christ he
saith, Thou shalt worship, shewing <hi>Moses</hi>
meant that feare whereby we do with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
and bowing of the body and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God worship him, moued thereunto
by religious feare, either in praying for some
mercy we want, or giuing thankes for some
benefite receiued.</p>
            <p>Againe, Christ in alleaging this text of
Scripture, he addes a word, yet so, as he doth
it without any fault: for though this word
(alone) be not in <hi>Moses</hi> his text expresly set
downe, yet it is included, and in sense it is
vnderstood: for where he saith in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
verse, <hi>Thou shalt feare the Lord,</hi> and
ads no more; in the fourteenth verse he saith,
Thou shalt not walke after any other gods;
so that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may easily perceiue he did in se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se
include it, though not expresse it in words:
and thus we see our sauiour Christ cleared.</p>
            <p>In the text of scripture alleaged by Christ,
note two points: first, what this worship and
feare is: secondly, to whom worship is due.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:29110:66"/>
First, worship taken generally, signifieth
the giuing of honor and reuerence to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Now this honour is either ciuill or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine.
Ciuill honour is that outward reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
we giue to men, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rostrating of the
body, or bowing of the knee; and the end of
this ciuill worship is, that thereby we might
acknowledge another to be our superiour: &amp;
therfore it is giuen of subiects to Princes, or
of inferiours to those that by some meanes
are their superiours. And thus <hi>Iacob</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
that is, gaue ciuil worship to <hi>Esau</hi>
seuen times, <hi>Genes.</hi> 33. 3. This reuerence
<hi>Abraham</hi> gaue to the Hittites, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 7. &amp;
<hi>Lot</hi> to the Angels bowed himselfe to the
ground, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 1. where he gaue them onely
ciuill worship and honour. So then it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
by these examples, that we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
bow and bend the knee and kneele to
Princes, to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ciuill honour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
shewing we do acknowledge them to be
placed aboue vs in authoritie and dignitie in
the world by God.</p>
            <p>The second kind of honour is diuine or
religious worship, when we giue such honor
to another, that thereby we do ascribe diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
&amp; diuine power vnto it, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby that it is some diuine thing aboue
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29110:67"/>
all creatures. And this we do first, when we
ascribe the godhead to it, and make it God:
secondly, when we ascribe Gods attributes
to it, as omnipotencie, prouidence, &amp;c. third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we acknowledge it to be the creator
and maker of all things: fourthly, when we
acknowledge it to be the giuer of those
good things we enioy, and the defender of
vs from euill.</p>
            <p>This diuine worship is either inward in
the heart, or outward in the body. Inward
diuine worship is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man giues his heart
to any thing, by beleeuing in it, by louing of
it, and reioycing in it aboue all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and that because it hath in it the god-head,
or diuine nature, or is God, because it
hath the attributes of God, because it is the
Creator and defender of all things, or else
because it giues vs all good things, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
vs from all euill.</p>
            <p>The outward diuine worship, is when a
man any wayes by prostrating himselfe and
bowing of his body, doth it to manifest his
faith, hope, loue, confidence, feare, or any gift
in his hart, thereby confessing it is his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
defender and preseruer.</p>
            <p>So then here is a manifest difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
outward ciuill worship, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29110:67"/>
worship which is outward: because by
that ciuill worship we do only acknowledge
them to whome we do it, to be our supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
but by this outward diuine worship,
we do acknowledge that to which we do
this worship to be God, Creator and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of vs and all other things.</p>
            <p>Now in this place our sauior Christ mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not that ciuill worship, but he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
outward diuine worship.</p>
            <p>There is another seruice mentioned,
which is feare: when we giue &amp; performe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to another, it is either a seruice ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
or in part: absolute, when we obey the
commandement of another simply without
all exception: when we obey another, not
onely outwardly in body, but inwardly in
soule, will, affections, &amp; with the conscience:
and this is proper to God alone, neither may
this absolute obedience be giuen to any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature,
onely God alone is to haue this abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
worship, so as we must obey him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all exceptions or question, and that in
body, soule, will, affections, and in the very
conscience.</p>
            <p>There is a second seruice, which is only
in part, which we may giue to men, as to
the Magistrate being in authoritie aboue vs,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29110:68"/>
vnder God; for God hath giuen them leaue
to make lawes, and power to giue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;
and they must be obeyed in ciuill
things, yet with condition, <hi>In the Lord,</hi> so
long as their commandements stand &amp; agree
with Gods commandements. Again, they
must be obeyed onely with our bodies: their
lawes cannot reach vnto mens hearts and
consciences, to bind them. And of these two
in this place, we are to vnderstand that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which is absolute, to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of the Lord absolutely and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
without condition or exception euen in
all things whatsoeuer he commaunds vs:
following herein our father <hi>Abraham,</hi> who
to performe obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the Lord, forsooke
his natiue countrey, &amp; was ready to offer his
sonne his onely sonne, his beloued sonne, his
sonne <hi>Izak</hi> the sonne of the promise.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the person to whom this
worship must be giuen. This diuine worship,
whether outward or inward, is due to God
alone, neither may it be giuen to any other
creature, though neuer so excellent. And
this is taught vs plainly by Christ his answer,
and it is agreeable to the first and second
commandements, where we are forbidden
expresly to giue this diuine and religious
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:29110:68"/>
worship either to any creature, or to idols,
but we must haue &amp; acknowledge Iehouah
to be our God alone. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19, 10. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi>
was about to worship the Angell, and to
giue him some part of this diuine worship,
he forbids him, and tels him that he is but his
fellow seruant, and chargeth <hi>Iohn</hi> to worship
God alone.</p>
            <p>So then by this which hath bene said, we
see how fitly our Sauiour Christ answered
the diuell, &amp; alleaged this place of Scripture
to stop his mouth. The diuell had shewed
him all the kingdomes of the world and the
glorie of them all: and tels Christ, if so be he
would but acknowledge him to be the giuer
of them, he would bestow them all vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.
Now our Sauiour Christ answereth, that he
may not giue that honour to him, which
belongeth to God alone and to none
else.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we learne from this answer of Christ,
that it is not lawfull for vs to giue this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
worship either inward or outward to
any creature, though neuer so excellent; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Angels, nor Saints: because it is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and proper to God alone. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal prostrate his bodie before
Saints to pray vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he maketh them no
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29110:69"/>
lesse then Gods, in giuing them that priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which is proper to God: namely, to
search the heart, that they can heare our
praiers, that they be omnipotent, omni-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
that is, present in all places at once,
with all things: which can be affirmed of
none but God alone. And yet this is the
common practise of the Papists, to yeeld this
diuine worship to Saints, and dead men
and women, and to adore and worship
them.</p>
            <p>But the Papists answer: They do not
worship Saints with that worship which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to God, neither do they worship the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as Gods. Why, no more would the Diuell
here haue Christ so to do, neither durst he
presume to tempt Christ to worship him as
God, but to acknowledge him to be the
giuer of all the kingdomes of the earth. And
the Diuell requires no more but outward
worship: and yet our Sauior Christ tels him,
that this outward worship which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
was proper to God alone, &amp; none
may or ought to haue it, saue he alone. Now
the Papists do giue that to Saints, which
Christ denyeth to the Diuell: for they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch,
that Saints can deliuer them from this
disease and that disease. They make them pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:29110:69"/>
not onely of priuate men, but of whole
kingdomes &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, as of Italie <hi>S. Martin,</hi>
of Spaine <hi>S, Iames,</hi> of England <hi>S. George. &amp;c.</hi>
Now to giue a kingdome (which Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to Satan) is a lesse matter then to be
a patron of a kingdome: for one may giue a
kingdome, that cannot defend a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Nay in truth, whatsoeuer they say, they
make the Saints gods: for they pray vnto
them, they make them intercessors for them
vnto God, to procure them fauour in things
concerning the life to come. They call the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> the Queene of heauen, they
make Christ to be her vnderling &amp; a punie:
for they pray her to commaund her sonne,
&amp; to cause him to heare their prayers, which
is to make her euen aboue God himselfe.
And therfore in truth they giue more to
Saints, then the Diuell required of Christ.</p>
            <p>Againe they answer: That which may be
done to earthly Princes,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> may much more be
done to Saints in heauen. Now say they, we
kneele and bow to earthly Princes, and do
reuerence to the chaire of Estate: why then
may we not to Saints?<note place="margin">Answer.</note> But we answer them:
It is true, we do kneele and bow vnto earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Princes, but all this that we do, we do it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:29110:70"/>
not so much to their persons, as to that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
God hath laid vpon them: and we
do it onely to shew our subiection vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But to kneele to Saints is no token of ciuill
honour, as this is which we giue to earthly
Princes, but a part of diuine honour. For by
that, they do acknowledge, that the Saints
can heare their prayers, search the hearts,
that they be omnipotent, and present in
euery place, which honour is due to God
alone.</p>
            <p>Yet though we may not thus adore Saints
as the Papists do,<note place="margin">VVhat ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due to Saints.</note> we do acknowledge a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
honour due vnto them: &amp; this honour
stands in three things: First, by giuing tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to God for them, in that the Lord hath giu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
his Church in former times such worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.
Secondly, by a reuerent estimation
of them, in that we accompt of them as the
friends of God. Thirdly, by honouring
them, though not with diuine worship,
yet by imitating their vertues: and this is
all that honour we owe vnto the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>Now if that the adoring of Saints be flat
vnlawfull and forbidden,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> then it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to appoint and dedicate solemne dayes
vnto them, to fast for them, to worship the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

to worship their reliques: all these be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and yet common among the Papists.
Neither can the Church of Rome iustly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
vs of the like, though we haue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the names of Saints dayes in the church
of England; because we dedicate those dayes
not to the worship of Saints as they do,
but to the seruice and worship of God
alone.</p>
            <p>We must mark how our Sauiour Christ in
alleaging and expounding of <hi>Moses</hi> ioynes
worship and feare together:<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> to shew, that
none can truly worship God but they that
do truly feare God.</p>
            <p>Men commonly think they haue done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
if they come to church on dayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
listen a while to the word, receiue
the Sacraments; they thinke this is all the
worship of God that he requires, though
they want the feare of God in their hearts:
but alas all this is to no purpose, if men want
the feare of God, &amp; practise iniustice in their
particular callings. Reade the first of <hi>Esa.</hi>
vers. 14. The Lord hates all the seruice and
worship which the Iewes offered him: not
simply, because these things were vnlawfull
in themselues,<note place="margin">Mich. 6. 6.</note> for the Lord had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them: but because they ioyned not

to the seruice of God, the feare of God, but
their hands were full of crueltie &amp; iniustice,
and they practised no mercie to men: and
whatsoeuer men professe in the worship of
God, and shew not the feare of God, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in their particular callings and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
with men, all is but hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>Whereas we teach that a man may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
perswaded by faith of his election
and saluation:<note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> the Papists say, we cannot
proue it out of the word of God. Now what
though we cannot find this sentence in so
many words: (I am elected) yet as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ by alleaging Scripture gathered
the sense of it: so may we without blame ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that out of the word which is the same
in sense, which we hold in this point.</p>
            <p>We see it is our dutie not only to worship
God with outward worship of the bodie,<note place="margin">Vse. 4.</note>
but with inward worship in the soule, mind,
will, affections, and in the conscience. <hi>Paul</hi>
he preached the Gospell of God vnto the
the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 4. 5.</note> to bring their very thoughts
into subiection: that is, so to order them, that
they might not thinke any thing but that
which was holy and according to the will
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the diuell left him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> In this verse
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29110:72"/>
is set downe the third and last part of the
conflicts of Christ with the diuell: namely,
the issue and euent of them, which is that
glorious victorie and conquest which our
Sauiour Iesus Christ got against the diuell.
And this is the most principall part of all the
rest. For what comfort could we haue had in
Christs temptations, in the preparation, in
the conflicts &amp; seuerall temptations, vnlesse
Christ had vanquished Satan, and got the
victorie? Nay all the comfort of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
stands in this victorie of our Lord and
Sauiour Iesus Christ: because now Christ
stood in our stead, and was tempted for our
sakes: so that he being our head, and getting
victorie ouer the diuel, the Church &amp; euery
member of the Church in Iesus Christ, got
victorie ouer Satan.</p>
            <p>In the victorie we are to obserue two
things: First, that the Diuell departed from
him: Secondly, the Angels ministred vnto
him.<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> In this departing of the Diuell from
Christ, we may behold the vnspeakable
goodnesse of God to his Church, for that
which befell Christ, befalleth the Church of
God. Now the Diuell hauing tempted Christ
in three seuerall and sore temptations, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
him in all three, and resisted the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29110:73"/>
Diuell in all his temptations: and then the
Diuell leaueth him, and goeth his way.
Wherein we see the endlesse loue of God, in
that he puts an end to the afflictions of his
Church, though they be many and sore, yet
they shall last but a time and haue an end.
So the Lord speaketh of <hi>Salomon:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 7. 14</note> If he sinne
I will chastise him with the rods of men and
with the plagues of the children of men: such
as should not be too extreame, but that he
should be able to beare. So the Prophet
<hi>Habacuck,</hi> he in the first chapter breaketh
out into impatient speeches, for the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Church: but chap. 2. vers. 3. the
Lord bids him <hi>waite,</hi> and tels him, it shall be
amended, and that he will put an end to
their miseries: the Lord hath promised that
he will not suffer his children to be tempted
aboue that they shall be able to beare, but
shall find a blessed issue of their temptations.
The two Prophets which were slaine for
doing their message,<note place="margin">Reu. 11. ver. 11. 12.</note> and for the testimonie
of Iesus, lay vnburied three dayes and an
halfe: but after the Lord puts into them the
spirit of life againe, and they reuiued, and
stood vp before the Lord, and they that saw
them shall be afraid, and see them ascend
vp into heauen. So that we may see, the Lord
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29110:73"/>
in mercie puts an end to all the afflictions of
his children.</p>
            <p>And this we may see by dayly experience,
some of Gods children are visited with
grieuous and fearefull temptations, some
halfe a yeare, some a whole yeare, some, two,
three, foure, ten yeares, yet at length the
Lord giues them a good issue, and puts an
end to their miserie; and in stead of horror of
conscience, sends them comfort; &amp; in stead
of griefe, ioy vnspeakable. And though the
Lord should suffer them to be tempted all
their life long til their dying day, yet then
the Lord would giue them a blessed issue of
all their miseries, and fill their soules with
exceeding comfort.</p>
            <p>Here we see a notable differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene
the first <hi>Adam</hi> and the second <hi>Adam.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> The
first <hi>Adam</hi> was tempted, and yeelded to
Satans temptations, and suffered the Diuell
to enter into his hart: the second <hi>Adam</hi>
Iesus Christ, he was likewise tempted, yet he
yeelded not to the least assault of the Diuell,
neither could he euer enter into his holy
heart, but departeth from him, and is faine
to leaue him.</p>
            <p>In this departure of the Diuell from
Christ, first, marke when he departed:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29110:74"/>
secondly, for how long he departed.</p>
            <p>For the first, <hi>Then the Diuell left him,</hi> that
is, after the three temptations were ended,
and Christ had in great indignation bid him
auoide Satan, for his blasphemous speeches,
then the Diuell departed.</p>
            <p>Here we see the best way to put the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
to flight,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> and to giue him the repulse:
namely, to resist him at the first, &amp; giue him
no ground. But as <hi>S. Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Resist the
diuell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and he will flie from thee:</hi> when as we
depend on Gods word, and the blessed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospell, praying for grace from
God to resist satan; he shal neuer preuaile
against vs, but will depart. And therefore it
is but foolishnesse to thinke or imagine that
he can be put to flight by musick, merry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
sports and pastimes, or such like vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
but the onely meanes to cause him to
depart, is the word and prayer, by them alone
he is resisted.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> They take a bad course, who thinke they
may yeeld to Satans temptations when they
are yong, and purpose in their old age to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him: but if we euer yeeld vnto him, we
do set open the doore of our hearts vnto the
Diuel, we do willingly receiue him, and bid
him welcom, and then he will not easily be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:29110:74"/>
driuen away: nay we shal find it a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
if not impossible, to put him to flight in
our old age. But as men in a dropsie, the
more they drinke, the more they desire: so
the more men yeeld to his temptations, the
more violently will he set vpon them.</p>
            <p>After that our sauiour Christ saith vnto
him, <hi>Auoide Satan,</hi> presently he departeth,
and is obedient to his commaundement.
What? was this any vertue in the Diuel to
obey Christs commandement? No surely, it
was no vertue in the Diuell: for we are to
vnderstand, there be two kinds of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
one is voluntary and chearfull, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by constraint and forced. Voluntary
obedience is that, when any of the creatures
of God do willingly through Gods grace
mouing them, obey the commaundement of
God, as all the good Angels of God, and
<hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, and all the children of
God that be effectually called, iustified, and
sanctified, do willingly and with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
yeeld obedience vnto God in part. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, there is a constrained obedience,
when one is vrged and compelled whether
he will or not to obey another; as one that
is a malefactor, being condemned to die, he
is obedient and yeeldeth himself to death, he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29110:75"/>
submitteth him selfe, because he must nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will nor choose. So the Diuell here o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth
the voice of Christ, and departeth at
his commaundement: but this obedience
in him is no vertue, because he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to do it, and could do none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>And that which here befell the Diuel,
shall befall all wicked &amp; impenitent sinners
if they will not now obey the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ, to repent and beleeue the
Gospell, they shall one day in spite of their
teeth be constrained, will they nil they, to
obey that commandement at the last day of
iudgement, <hi>Depart ye cursed into euerlasting
fire, prepared for the diuell and his angels.</hi> The

of the diuell, we may gather, that Christ was
tempted with no smal and easie temptation,
but that he was tempted in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that could be: for the Diuell made an
end of his temptations before he left him,
and had his will in tempting of him, and
therefore no question, in these three maine
temptations that we haue spoken of, he te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him as much as he could, and shewed his
greatest extremitie and fraud. And this may
appeare, in that the Angels were faine to
come &amp; comfort our Sauiour Christ: so that
he was not tempted with some light and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
temptations, but in most extreame
manner, so as his heart within him was in
perplexitie, anguish and griefe, yet without
all sinne.</p>
            <p>And this may minister comfort to the
children of God;<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> if any man be tempted with
some grieuous temptation, in some won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
and fearefull maner, that he is almost
at the point of despaire, yet let him stay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and let him not thinke that therefore
he is cast away: for here we see, that Iesus
Christ the Son of God was tempted in the
highest degree that might be, and therefore
the dearest seruants of God may be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tempted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:29110:76"/>
We must learne from hence to suspend
our iudgements:<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> and if we see any so fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tempted, &amp; their temptations so extreme
and grieuous, that they say of them selues
that they be cast-awayes, or that while they
yet liue they are already in hel; let vs take
heed we be not too rash in condemning of
them, neither let vs speake or thinke of them
as cast-awayes: for our Sauiour Christ was
tempted in the highest measure that could
be, and why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not these kind of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
befall the dearest children of God?
Therefore that which is written of <hi>Francis
Spira,</hi> that he was a reprobate &amp; a cast-away,
was penned very inconsiderately, though he
affirmed the same of himself; for there did
nothing befall him, which may not befall a
child of God: for we see that our Sauiour
Christ himselfe was tempted in the greatest
measure that might be, and we haue dayly
experience from time to time, that some of
the deare children of God haue bene in like
sort assaulted to despaire for a time, to thinke
themselues reprobates and cast-awayes, yet
it hath pleased the Lord in time to restore
them to the feeling of his loue, and they
haue continued the faithfull seruants of God
till their dying day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:29110:76"/>
And as it is said, <hi>the diuel departed as
soone as he had ended all his temptations:</hi> we
may gather, that these three wherewith he
assaulted our Sauiour Christ, they be the
most principall temptations of the Diuell, &amp;
the very ground of all other his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
and therefore it shall be good for vs to
learne to know them, and the daunger of
them, that we may arme our selues by the
example of Christ against them especially.</p>
            <p>The second circumstance to be marked in
the Diuels departure, is that which S. <hi>Luke</hi>
addeth, though it be not expressed in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
namely, that the Diuell left Christ <hi>but
for a season:</hi> but we neuer reade that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
did tempt our Sauiour Christ after this,
but once vpon the crosse: then indeed the
Diuell and all his Angels set vpon him,
<hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 15. I answer, the Diuell tempts ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by himselfe, or else by wicked men. It is
true indeed, we reade not that the Diuell
did euer tempt Christ after his departure
from him, but once when he was on the
crosse; but he set wicked men a work in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
of him continually. So he tempted
<hi>Euah</hi> but once by himselfe, but no doubt he
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted her after many times by other means</p>
            <p>Secondly, the diuell tempts by his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:29110:77"/>
namely, by wicked and vngodly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
and thus he tempted <hi>Adam,</hi> not by himselfe,
but by <hi>Euah:</hi> so he tempted <hi>Iob,</hi> not onely
by himselfe, in casting the house vpon his
children, but also by his vile instruments the
Sabeans and Caldeans, whom he set a work
to rob and spoile him, and after by his mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
friends.</p>
            <p>So though we reade not that the Diuell
did tempt Christ all his life time after this by
himselfe, yet did he it by his instruments, as
the Scribes and Pharises, the cruell Iewes,
yea by <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate, Annas</hi> and <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi>
and the rest: he neuer ceased tempting
of him after this; and these temptations by
his vile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> instruments were very great and
grieuous vnto his sacred soule.</p>
            <p>Seeing the diuell tooke this course to
tempt Christ, and then to depart for a while,
and after to returne againe: we may see what
is the estate of Gods Church in this world,
namely, that the Church of God vpon earth
is in a continuall intercourse of afflictions:
now afflicted; after, the Lord giues it peace
for a time: and then the Lord sendeth affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
againe: and as winter followeth som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
so doth ioy afflictions.</p>
            <p>This being the estate of the church of God
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29110:77"/>
vpon earth, a continuall intercourse of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
we must then learne what is our own
particular estate while we liue in the church,
namely, a state that is in a continuall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of troubles and afflictions. If we now
inioy peace and rest, we must make account
it cannot alwaies indure, but there must
come a change: and therefore we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
in time of peace to prepare our selues
against the time of affliction and of triall, and
perswade our selues the Sunne will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
shine, but this state will change, and
triall will come. It followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And behold the Angels came and ministred
vnto him.]</hi> Here is now the second part of
the victorie: when as our Sauiour Christ had
foiled the Diuell, and put him to flight, then
the Angels come and minister vnto him, to
comfort him after this tedious combat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold]</hi> This word is a word of wonder,
and it sheweth there is some matter of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that followeth: and what is that? the
wonder is, that that person whom the diuell
despised, and would haue troden vnder his
feete, euen this person is here attended vpon
by the good Angels of God, who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to offer him their seruice, and come to
comfort him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:29110:78"/>
In this ministerie of these Angels consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
first the bond which caused them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
on Christ: secondly, the number, how
many they were: thirdly, the time when they
came to him.</p>
            <p>First the bond which maketh these glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Angels and heauenly spirits to attend
and waite vpon our Sauiour Christ, is this,
that the man Christ, not the manhood of
Christ, but Christ God and man, is Lord of
all creatures, euen of the Angels in heauen.
And the manhood of Christ, though it be
not Lord of Angels, yet it is farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
then any creature whatsoeuer, yea
then the blessed Angels.</p>
            <p>And here we may behold the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God, who hath exalted mans nature
which was most vile by reason of sinne, to be
farre more excellent then any Angell in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
as it is ioyned to the Godhead in the
person of Christ.</p>
            <p>So then the Angels minister to Christ not
as simply man, but as God-man, or God
and man: and so they minister to all the true
members of Christ Iesus, which are truly
coupled and vnited vnto his mysticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
Christ is that ladder of <hi>Iacob,</hi> whereby
the Angels of God do ascend and descend,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:29110:78"/>
to do seruice to all those which are truly ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto Iesus Christ, Gen. 28.</p>
            <p>This ought to make vs all admire the
endlesse and vnspeakeable goodnes of God,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note>
who hath not onely giuen vs to be Lords of
heauen and earth by the meanes of Christ,
but euen the glorious Angels, which are
farre aboue man in excellencie, to be our
seruants, to minister vnto vs, to comfort and
defend vs.</p>
            <p>This should moue vs all to carrie and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
our selues reuerently and holily in all
our actions and speeches,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> seeing the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and blessed Angels of God do waite and
attend vpon vs. Truly this ought to make vs
haue great regard that no vnseemely speech
or action passe from vs, seeing we be in the
presence of these most excellent creatures of
God, the blessed &amp; holy Angels, to behaue
our selues with greater reuerence then we
would before an earthly Prince, and in the
presence of a mightie Monarch.</p>
            <p>2 The number of them.<note place="margin">Luk. 22.</note> It is not said, there
came one Angell, as in the garden: but, the
Angels came vnto him: shewing there were
mo then one. And we find in the word, that
our Sauiour Christ had sometimes one, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
mo to attend vpon him. And so the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29110:79"/>
wicked Angels come sometimes one alone
as here in Christs temptations: sometimes
many, as when Christ was on the crosse,
Colossians 2. 15. And so it is likewise with
the good Angels of God: sometimes they
come one alone, sometimes moe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

to the ground, which holds, that euery

our afflictions were plagues, as to the Egyptians:
curses, as to Cham: destruction, as to Sodome:

            <sp>
               <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
               <p>The conflict of all these, is tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereby a man is prouoked to commit
such wickednesse as is hurtfull to the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his soule. 1. Pet. 2. 11. <hi>Dearely beloued,

                  <hi>Resistance is an action, whereby
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29110:85"/>
the souldier doth withstand temptation,
through grace working inwardly in him. 1.
Iohn</hi> 2. 14. I write vnto you babes, because ye
haue knowne the Father: I haue written to you
fathers, because ye haue knowne him that is from
the beginning: I haue written to you yong men,
because ye are strong, and the word of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in you, and ye haue ouercome the wicked.
1. <hi>Pet. 5. 8. Ephes. 6. 16. Psal.</hi> 91. 13. Thou shalt

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
               <p>To confirme this, these preseruatiues
which follow are very necessary.</p>
               <p>1. When you are tempted to sinne, do not
only abstaine from it, but earnestly loue and
follow after the contrary. Iohn 8. 44.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Neuer yeeld or consent to Satans words,
whether he speake the truth, accuse falsly, or
flatter dissemblingly. Iohn</hi> 8. 44. Ye are of
your father the diuell, and the lusts of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye will do: he hath bin a murderer from the
beginning, and abode not in the truth, because
there is no truth in him: when he speaketh a lie,
then speaketh he of his owne; for he is a lier, and
the father thereof. <hi>Marke</hi> 1. 24. And cried
with a loud voice, and said, What haue I to do
with thee, Iesus the sonne of the most high God?
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29110:85"/>
And Iesus said, Hold thy peace, and come out of
him. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 17. She followed Paul and vs, and
cried, saying: These men are the seruants of the
most high God, which shew vnto vs the way of
saluation, &amp;c. <hi>August. serm.</hi> 241.</p>
               <p>3. One temptation is to be looked for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, and then especially when our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
after he hath set his snares, is at rest:
for the diuel neuer maketh an end of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,

me (I pray you) what is his fall.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fall is, whereby the souldier
through infirmitie fainteth, being subdued
by the power of the enemie. Gal.</hi> 6. 1. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
if a man be fallen by occasion into any fault,
ye which are spirituall, restore such a one with
the spirit of meeknesse, considering thy selfe least
thou also be tempted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lidia.</speaker>
               <p>If I fall, how may I rise?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
               <p>To this appertaineth the spirituall
remedie: now a remedie, is a thing hauing
aptnesse to restore him which is fallen to his
former estate. Gal. 6. 1.</p>
               <p>And here two things must alwayes be
thought on.</p>
               <p>1. If there be a willing mind, euery one is
accepted for that grace which he hath, not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29110:86"/>
                  <hi>for that which he hath not. 2. Corint.</hi> 8. 12,
For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted
according to that a man hath, and not according
to that he hath not.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>In all these things, whosoeuer wil leade
a godly life in Christ, the power of God is to
be made perfect through their infirmitie. 2.
Cor.</hi> 12. 9. And he said vnto me, My grace is
sufficient for thee, for my power is made perfect
through weaknesse: very gladly therefore will I
reioyce rather in mine infirmities, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God may dwell in me. 10. Therefore I take
pleasure in infirmities, in reproches, in necessities,
in persecutions, in anguish for Christs sake, for
when I am weake, then am I strong.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The first is about the Christian mans
effectuall calling: and the temptation is the
enterprise of the Diuell, to blindfold mans
mind and to harden his hart, lest the word of
God should work in him to saluation. Mat. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

much earth, and anon they sprang vp, because
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29110:86"/>
they had no depth of earth. 6. And when the sun
rose vp, they were parched; &amp; for lack of rooting
withered away. 7. And some fell among thornes,
and the thornes sprung vp and choked them. 19.
Whensoeuer a man heareth the word of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

                  <hi>A resistance in those that are called,
is wrought by the spirit of God, that causeth
men to lend their eares to heare, and doth
ingraffe the word in their hearts, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall

               <p>The remedie is double:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:29110:89"/>
                  <hi>First, the operation of the holy Spirit,
stirring vp faith and increasing the same.
Philip.</hi> 1. 6. I am perswaded of this same thing,
that he that hath begunne this good worke in
you, will performe it vntill the day of Iesus
Christ. Luk. 17. 5. And the Apostles said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, Increase our faith.</p>
               <p>The second is, an holy meditation, which
is manifold:</p>
               <p>1 <hi>That it is the commandement of God,
that we should beleeue in Christ. 1. Ioh.</hi> 3. 23.
This is then his commaundement, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in the name of his Sonne Iesus Christ, and
loue one another, as he gaue commaundement.</p>
               <p>2 That the Euangelicall promises are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite,
and do exclude no man, vnlesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
any man do exclude himselfe, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa.
55. 1. <hi>Ho, euery one that thirsteth, come ye
to the waters, and ye that haue no siluer, come,
buy, and eate: come, I say, buy wine and milke
without siluer and without money.</hi> Mat. 11. 28.
<hi>Come vnto me all ye that are wearie and laden,
and I will ease you.</hi> Ioh. 3. 15. <hi>That whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
beleeueth in him should not perish, but haue
eternall life.</hi> Also the Sacraments of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
and the Lords Supper, do to euery one
seuerally apply indefinite promises, and
therefore are very effectuall to enforce par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:29110:90"/>
assurance or plerophorie of forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of sinnes.</p>
               <p>3 That doubtfulnesse and despaire are
most grieuous sinnes.</p>
               <p>4 <hi>That contrarie to hope, men must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hope beleeue with Abraham. Rom. 4.
18.</hi> Which Abraham aboue hope beleeued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hope, that he should be the father of many
nations: according to that which was spoken to
him, So shall thy seed be.</p>
               <p>5 <hi>That the mercie of God, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christs obedience, being both God
and man, are infinite. Esa.</hi> 54. 10. For the
mountaines shall remoue, and the hils shall fall
downe: but my mercie shall not depart from
thee, neither shall my couenant of peace fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
saith the Lord, that hath compassion on
thee. <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 11. For as high as the heauen
is aboue the earth, so great is his mercie toward
them that feare him. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 1. My babes,
these things write I vnto you, that ye sinne not:
and if any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with
the Father, Iesus Christ the iust. 2. And he is
the reconciliation for our sinnes: and not for ours
onely, but also for the sinnes of the whole world.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 137. 7. Let Israel waite on the Lord: for
the Lord is mercie, and with him is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:29110:90"/>
6 <hi>That God measureth the obedience
due vnto him, rather by the affection and
desire to obey, then by the act and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it. Rom.</hi> 8. 5. For they that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the flesh, sauour the things of the flesh, but
they that are after the spirit, the things of the
spirit. 7. Because the wisedome of the flesh, is
enmitie against God: for it is not subiect to the
law of God, neither indeed can be. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 20.
Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that
do it, but the sinne that dwelleth in me. 21. I
find then by the law, that when I would do good,
euill is present with me. 22. For I delight in the
law of God, concerning the inner man. <hi>Mal. 3.
17.</hi> I will spare them, as a man spareth his son,
that reuerenceth him.</p>
               <p>7 <hi>When one sinne is forgiuen, all the
rest are remitted also: for remission being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
once, without any prescription of time,
is giuen for euer. Rom.</hi> 11. 29. For the gifts
and calling of God are without repentance. <hi>Act.
10.</hi> 43. To him also giue all the Prophets wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that through his name, all that beleeue
in him, shall receiue remission of sinnes.</p>
               <p>8 That grace and faith are not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by fals of infirmitie, but thereby are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and made manifest. Rom. 5. 20. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
the law entred thereupon, that the offence</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:29110:91"/>
should abound: neuerthelesse, where sin aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
there grace abounded much more. 2. <hi>Cor.
12.</hi> 7. And lest I should be exalted out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
&amp;c. there was giuen vnto me a pricke in
the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me. 8.
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that
it might depart from me. 9. He said, My grace
is sufficient for thee.</p>
               <p>9 That all the workes of God are by
contrarie meanes. 2. Cor. 12. 9. <hi>My power
is made perfect through weaknesse.</hi>

               <p>By the blessing of God I will not
forget to practise these soueraigne remedies
if Satan at any time seeke to take away my
faith, and to cut off this hand by which I
must apply, or to blindfold this eye, by
which I may behold Christ sitting at Gods
right hand, as <hi>Stephen</hi> did. Let me heare, I

               <p>
                  <hi>The temptation is a prouoking to
sinne, according as the disposition of euery
man, and as occasion shall offer it selfe, 1.
Chron.</hi> 21. 1. And Satan stood vp against Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
and prouoked Dauid to number Israel.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:29110:91"/>
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 2. And when supper was done, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
had now put into the heart of Iudas Iscariot,
Simons sonne, to betray him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lid.</speaker>
               <p>Let me not be ignorant of Satans
enterprises. How will he allure to sinne?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this temptation, the diuell doth
wonderfully diminish and extenuate those
sins which men are about to commit, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by obiecting closely the mercie of God,
and partly by couering or hiding the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is due for the sin. Besides, there
are helpes to further the diuell in this his
temptation: as first, the flesh which lusteth
against the spirit, sometimes by begetting
euill motions and affections, and sometimes
by ouerwhelming and oppressing the good
intents and motions, Gal.</hi> 5. 17. For the flesh
lufteth against the spirit, and the spirit against
the flesh: and these are contrarie one to another,
so that ye cannot do the same things that ye
would. 19. Moreouer, the workes of the flesh
are manifest: which are, adulterie, fornication,
vncleanenesse, wantonnesse. 20. Idolatrie, witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
hatred, debate, emulations, wrath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
seditions, heresies. 21. Enuie, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
drunkennesse, gluttonie, and such like,
whereof I tell you before, as I also haue told you
before, that they which do such things shall not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:29110:92"/>
inherit the kingdome of God. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 14. But
euery man is tempted, when he is drawne away
by his owne concupiscence, and is entised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, the world, which bringeth
men to disobedience, through pleasure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
honour, and euill examples, Ephesians
2.</hi> 3. Among whom we also had our conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in time past, in the lustes of the flesh, in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
the will of the flesh, and of the mind, and
were by nature the children of wrath, as well as
others. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 16. For all that is in the
world, as the lusts of the flesh, and the lust of the
eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the father,
but is of the world.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resistance, is made by the desire
of the spirit, which worketh good motions
and affections in the faithfull, and driueth
foorth the euill. Gal.</hi> 5. 22. But the fruite of
the spirit is loue, ioy, peace, long suffering, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse,
goodnesse, faith, 23. Meekenesse, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancie:
against such there is no law. 24. For
they that are Christs, haue crucified the flesh,
with the affections and the lusts thereof. 26. Let
vs not be desirous of vaine glorie, prouoking one
another, enuying one another.</p>

               <p>The preseruatiues are these.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>To account no sinne light or small.
Gal.</hi> 5. 9. Alitle leauen doth leauen the whole
lumpe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. For the wages of sinne is
death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through
Iesus Christ our Lord.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>To auoide all occasions of sinne. To
these rather agreeth the Prouerb vsed of the
Plague:</hi> longè, tardè, citò: <hi>that is,</hi> aloofe, slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
quickly. 1. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 5. 22. Abstaine from all
appearance of euill. <hi>Iud. v.</hi> 23. And other saue
with feare, pulling them out of the fire, and hate
euen the garment spotted by the flesh.</p>
               <p>3 To accustome thy selfe to subdue the
lesser sinnes, that at the last, thou maist also
ouercome the greater. Rom. 13. 4.</p>
               <p>4. To apply thy selfe to thy appointed
calling, and alway to be busily occupied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
something in the same.</p>
               <p>5 <hi>To oppose the law, the iudgements
of God, the last iudgement, the glorious
presence of God, and such like, against the
rebellion and loosenesse of the flesh. Pro. 28
14.</hi> Blessed is the man that feareth alway: but
he that hardeneth his heart, shall fall into euill.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9. There is no man greater in this
house then I: neither hath he kept any thing
from me, but onely thee, because thou art his

               <p>Against vniust anger, or priuate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of reuenge. Here meditate, 1. iniuries;
they happen vnto vs by the Lords appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for our good. 2. Sam. 16. 10. 2. God of
his great goodnesse forgiueth vs farre more
sinnes, then it is possible for vs to forgiue
men. 3. It is the dutie of Christian loue, to
forgiue others. 4. We must not desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them, whom Christ hath redeemed by
his precious bloud. 5. We our selues are in
daunger of the wrath of God, if we suffer our
wrath to burne against our brother. <hi>Forgiue</hi>
saith he) <hi>and it shall be forgiuen.</hi> 6. We know
not the circumstances of the facts, what the

               <p>Bridles or externall remedies, are these:
1. in this we shall imitate the clemencie of
the Lord, who for a very great season doth
often tolerate the wicked. <hi>Learne of me, for

him. Psal. 33. 18. 19. <hi>The eye of the Lord is

from death, and to preserue them from famine.</hi>
2. Godlinesse is great gaine, if the mind of
man can be therewith content. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6. 3.
we do waite and looke for the resurrection
of the bodie, and eternall life: therefore we
should not take such carking care for this
present mortall life. 4. We are seruants in
our fathers house, therefore looke what is
conuenient for vs, that will he louingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow

by the maner of perswasion; for the holy

differeth much from that which Satan vseth.
Thirdly, by the effects of that testimonie; for
if the perswasion arise from presumption,
it is a dead perswasion: but contrariwise, it is
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:29110:99"/>

a Minister of the Gospell, as he is a Minister,
and a Christian as he is a Christian; and if

for them, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. 6. If you call earnestly
vpon God, euen with teares. 7. If you desire
Christs comming to iudgement, that an end
might be made of these dayes of sin. 8. If you
flie all occasions of sin, and endeuor to come
to newnesse of life. 9. And last of all, if you
perseuere vnto the last gaspe in these things.
For, as one saith, he that wil serue God, must
beleeue that which he cannot see, hope for
that which is deferred, loue God when he
shewes himself an enemie; and thus remaine
to the end.</p>

               <p>Are they so? Then know that God
tameth you, yet so as you must not therewith
be dismaied: for it is certaine, that if you haue
faith but as a graine of mustard-seed, and be
as weake as a yong infant, it is sufficient to
ingraft you into Christ: and therefore you
must not doubt of your owne election, by
reason of your weaknesse. A child holding a
staffe in his hand, holdeth it as well as a man,
though not with so much strength; and you
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:29110:100"/>
laying hold vpon Christ by faith, though
you do it neuer so weakely, it will suffise for
your saluation. Nay, if one haue not yet felt
these effects in his heart, he must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
he is a reprobate, but must rather vse
the word of God and the Sacraments, that
he may haue inward sense of the power of
Christ drawing him vnto him, and an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his redemption by Christs death
and passion.</p>
