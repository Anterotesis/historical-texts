            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore our labours intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perfect <hi>Arts,</hi> should by the assistance of the Author of Truth and Life, consider by what meanes the Life of man may be prolonged.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:608:7"/>
Life being an increasing heape of sinnes and sorrowes lightly esteemed of Christians aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Heaven, should not be dispised, because it affoords longer opportunity of doing good Workes. Moreover <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matus</hi> survived the other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and many Fathers, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially many holy Monkes and Hermites, lived very long, whereby it seemes that this blessing of <hi>long Life</hi> (so often repeated in the Law) was after our Saviours time lesse dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished then other earthly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions. But the happinesse of long <hi>life</hi> is naturally desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, although the meanes to attaine it, through false opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and vaine reports be hard to find, the generall opinion of Physitians concerning <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall</hi>

                  <hi>mosture,</hi> and <hi>Natural heat</hi> being deceiveable, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate praise of <hi>Chymicall</hi> Medicines possessing others with failing hopes.</p>
               <p>That which admits repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, remayning whole and sound in Essence, may be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally preserved, as the Vestall Fire, whereupon Physitians and Phylosophers perceiving that the bodies of living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being nourished, repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and refreshed, grew old afterward, and speedily peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, they sought Death in an irreparable subject, supposing Radicall moysture incapable of solid reparation, from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy there being no just repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but an unlike Addition, sensibly by Age decayed, and at last corrupted, and dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:608:8"/>
This conceit of theirs was ignorant and vaine, for young living creatures being all over and wholly repaired, do by their increasing in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and growing better in quality, shew that if the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and manner of repairing decayed not, the matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing might be eternall.

estate of Age easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; but there is much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and danger in repairing the dry parts, and fuller of pores, as <hi>membranes, tunicles, nerves, arteries, veines, gristles,</hi> most of the bowels, and all the organicall and instrumentall parts. For when those parts that should performe their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to other actually reparable parts, cannot, being decayed in strength, execute their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, a generall ruine follows, and parts naturally restore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, through defective Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of <hi>Reparation,</hi> doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and decay. For the <hi>spirit,</hi> like a light flame, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually feeds on bodies, and the Ayre without conspiring therewith, doth suck and dry the fabrick and instruments of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:608:9"/>
the body, which are thereby decayed, and made unfit to performe the office of repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. And these are the true wayes whereby <hi>natur all Death</hi> approacheth, deserving due consideration: For how can Natures course, if unknowne, bee helped or prevented? Therefore the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>consumption,</hi> or decay of mans body may be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the repairing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing thereof furthered, are most precious, and worth knowing. The <hi>spirits</hi> and <hi>ayre</hi> without are the chiefe causes of <hi>consumption,</hi> and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall progresse of Nourishment is the cause of <hi>restoration.</hi> For the <hi>spirit</hi> within and the <hi>ayre</hi> without doe worke on dead bodies, striving also to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

in living bodies the same effects, though weakened and restrayned by the <hi>vitall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and partly by them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased. For bodies without <hi>life</hi> doe a long while subsist and endure without Reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>creatures</hi> without due nourishment and <hi>reparation</hi> suddenly decayes, and is extinguished like <hi>fire.</hi> Therefore a two-fold search is required, considering mans body as livelesse and unnou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished; and as living, and nourished.

               <p n="1">1. MEn like Owles wondrous sharp-sighted in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:608:25"/>
of their owne opinions, are blinded with the day-light of Experience. The elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall quality of <hi>drynesse,</hi> and how <hi>drynesse</hi> by a natural wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king doth corrupt and consume bodies, is observed, but not the beginning, proceeding, and ending of <hi>drynesse</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Drynesse and Consumption proceed from three Actions, originally caused by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall spirit of bodies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The 1. Action is the refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of moisture into spirit, the 2. the spirits venting; the 3. the drawing or closing together of the bodies thicker parts the spirit being gotten out. The former are Causes onely of Consumption, the last is that drynesse and hardnesse, heere chiefly handled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:608:26"/>The refining of Spirits is cleare and manifest; for the spirit inclosed in every tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible body that may bee toucht, forgets not to alter and change whatsoever is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestable and convertible in the body, and doth multiply it selfe by begetting a new spirit. This is most evident in substances, which by dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse being abated in weight, are hollow, and full of pores, and doe yeeld an inward kind of sound; for the spirit making things lighter rather than hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, by converting into it selfe the heavy moisture of a body, makes it lighter in weight. And this is the first Action, namely of refining &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verting moisture into spirit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The second Action of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:608:26"/>
spirits venting is also evident. For this venting forth of the spirit may be seene in vapours, and smelt in decaying odours and sents, or if breaking out by degrees, as in age, is the same, but insensibly performed. Moreover, the spirit in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact close body, finding no pores whereby to vent, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to get out, drives and thrusts out the thicker parts of the bodies superficies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by making mettalls rust, and fat substances grow moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And this is the second Action of the Spirits ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The third Action obscurer, but certaine, is the contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thicker parts, after the spirits getting forth, for bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do then contract &amp; take up
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:608:27"/>
lesser roome, as dry'd Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kernels fill not their shells, and beames and wooden rafters joyned close at first, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward through drynesse doe chinke, and cleave asunder, and Bowles chap and gape with drynesse. Secondly, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the wrinkles of withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red bodies, some parts by contraction being loosened, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers drawne together, and wrinkled. For wrinkled out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides of bundels of Paper and old Parchments, the skinne of living creatures, and soft cheese having an outward coate wrinkled with age, are smooth within: and so Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Paper, and leaves held before the fire, doe wrinkle, turne, and winde together. For Age by slow contracting and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:608:27"/>
drawing together, doth cause wrinkles; but fire doth hastily contract, and fold together: and substances uncapable of wrinkles do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract, and grow hard. But when bodies, after the spirits are violently ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and moisture consumed, cannot unite &amp; contract, they putrefie into a masse of dust, which being lightly touched falls asunder, and vanishes into ayre, as burnt Paper and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and embalmed carkasses will doe. And this is the third action of Contraction of thick parts after the Spirits venting.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Observe, that when fire and heate drying onely acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, have performed their proper worke of refining and diffusing the spirit and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, then the parts acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:608:28"/>
contract, onely to avoid vacuity and emptinesse, or for other reasons.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Putrefaction and drynesse proceeding from the inward spirit, differ in their ingresse and entrance: for in putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction all the spirit is not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but a part detayn'd, which like a silent fancy works divers changes on the thicker parts not locally contracted, and brings them to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme likenesse.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:608:36"/>
from divers causes, insteed of certayne Rules hard to find, these <hi>notes</hi> following may be added.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Birds are longer-liv'd then Beasts, as th' <hi>Eagle, Vulter, Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, Kite, Raven, Crow, Swan, Goose, Storke, Crane, Ib is, Parret, Ringdove, &amp;c.</hi> though they are lesser, and in one yeare at their ful <hi>growth.</hi> For Birds are long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd, because they are wel clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with warme Feathers to keepe out cold, and doe live in the free open Aire, as Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayners doe, or because when they flye, they are carryed by the Ayre &amp; their Wings, this mixt motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> helthful or because Birds are not pin'd for want of nourishment, or thrust in the belly of their old Bird, by turnes laying her <hi>eggs;</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:608:37"/>
but especially because Birds partaking more of the Hennes substance than of the Cocks, have not such sharpe and hot spirits.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a Position, that living creatures begotten by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantity of the Dammes seed (as Birds are) than of the Sires, and lying longer in their Dammes belly, partaking more of the Dammes seed than the Sires, are therefore longer liv'd. And it is observe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that men being in visage and countenance liker their mother than their father, doe live longest; as those children doe, which sound and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men beget on young Wives.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Living creatures may receive much hurt or good in their first
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:608:37"/>
breeding; for such as lye not too close together in the belly of the Damme, but have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient nourishment, are long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd; as the <hi>egges</hi> of Birds laid by turnes, and the young of Beasts, bringing but one at a yeaning, have roome enough and nourishment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Long bearing in the mothers wombe, and the Dammes <hi>bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> is forthree respects a cause of long life. First, the of-spring hath more of the mothers or Dammes substance: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it becomes a stronger <hi>birth.</hi> Thirdly, it better endures the Ayres power. Lastly, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes, that Nature intended such a Birth for the Center of a large circumference of many yeeres. The short life of Oxen and Sheepe, Calves, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:608:38"/>
Lambs lying sixe moneths in their Dams belly before they are calved &amp; yeaned, proceeds from other causes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Grazing Cattle are short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd, but Beasts feeding on flesh live longer, and Birds which do eate seeds and fruits. For halfe the long-lived Harts foode growes (as they say) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his head; and the Goose feeding not onely on Grasse, finde some foode in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another cause of <hi>long life,</hi> is warme cloathing, and keeping out immoderate heat and cold, whereby the Body is much weakned and decay'd, as Birds cloathed with warm Feathers, are therefore longer liv'd. But Sheepe having thicke Fleeces, are not longliv'd, being subject
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:608:38"/>
to many Diseases, and <hi>feeding</hi> onely on <hi>grasse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Head</hi> is the principall <hi>seate</hi> of all the <hi>Spirits,</hi> beeing great wasters and consumers of the Body, so that the <hi>great</hi> abundance, or <hi>sharp</hi> inflamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> shortens <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Birds having little heads inrespect of their bodies are <hi>long liv'd,</hi> and men having very great heads live not <hi>long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The best kind of motion for <hi>prolonging of Life,</hi> is to be born and carried, as the <hi>Swan</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther swiming water Fowle are, and all Birds <hi>flying</hi> more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with their wings, and fish whose <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>long life</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Slow comming to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both for Growth and ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, signifies <hi>long life</hi> in al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:608:39"/>
for teeth, private haire, and a Beard, are degrees of maturity or ripenesse prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Manhood.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Milde meeke ereatures, as Sheepe and Doves, are not long-liv'd, the gall being like a whetstone, whereon natures faculties are sharpened, and fitted to performe their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Creatures having white flesh, live not so long as those, whose blacker flesh shewes that their Bodies moisture is finner, and more compact.</p>
               <p n="12">12. As a great fire is lasting, and not soone extinguished, and a little water soone evaporates: so quantity and bignesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve corruptible bodies; a twigge withering sooner than the body of a Tree, and all

               <head>The History.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NOurishment should bee of an inferiour nature, and <note place="margin">Artic. 4.</note> simpler in substance than the <hi>body</hi> nourished. Plants are nourished by the Earth and Water, living creatures by Plants; and men by <hi>living creatures,</hi> feeding partly on flesh as man doth on Plants; but neither can subsist by Plants or Sallets onely; but Fruits and parched Corne will sustaine life.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:608:40"/>2. Nourishment too like the nourished <hi>substance,</hi> is not <hi>good.</hi> For Grazing Cattle touch not any flesh, and Beasts feeding on flesh prey not upon their owne kind. <hi>Anthro Pophagi</hi> or <hi>Cannibals,</hi> feede not one mens flesh ordinarily, but by <hi>eating</hi> their enemies flesh as a great dainty, doeat once sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>reuenge.</hi> Also seede Corne in the same field where it Grew, should not be sowne, nor a Graft be set into the stocke, whence it was taken.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nourishment well prepared, and somwhat like the <hi>nourished substance,</hi> makes Plants fruitful and living Creatures Fat. For the stocks nourishment is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more agreeable unto the Grafts nature, then the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:608:40"/>
earths nourishment to a young Tree or Plant. And an Onion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed or a Plants seede sowne or set in the earth, produceth not such a <hi>great Onion,</hi> or faire Plant, as when the seede is put into an <hi>Onion,</hi> or into a Plants root, and so set in the ground.</p>
               <p>The Boughs of Elme, Oke, and Ash, and such Forrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, <hi>grafted</hi> on stocks, and comming to bee trees, have broader leaves tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted trees. Also men feed not so wel on raw flesh as on roast.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Living creatures</hi> receive nourishment at their mouth, Plants at the roote, young creatures in the wombe at the navell. Birds are nourished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while by the white of the <hi>egge,</hi> part thereof being found in their throats after hatching.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:608:41"/>5. Observe, that although all nourishment proceeds and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from the Center to the Circumference, issuing forth from the inward parts to the outward, yet Trees receive not from their inward parts and pith so much nourishment as from their outward parts and Barke, which being stript off, they presently wither, and dye. Also of <hi>living creatures,</hi> the flesh beneath and above the veines is nourished by the blood.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By the inward function of extruding or driving out, and the outward operation of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting nourishment, the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing faculty doth worke.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Vegetables or Plants simply digest their nourishment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out avoyding superfluous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:608:41"/>
Gummes of Trees being rather superfluities of nourishment than excrements, and knobs and knots, sores: but <hi>living creatures</hi> discerning what nourishment is like their substance, doe digest the best, and reject the rest in excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The greatest and fairest fruits hanging on the Tree, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all their nourishment through their stalkes.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Living creatures</hi> seed being sowne and spent, is onely at first capable of nourishment, but seeds of Plants after long keeping will grow: but young <hi>grafts</hi> and <hi>shoots</hi> must be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted while they are fresh and greene, or else they will not grow, but their roots being not covered with earth, will dye.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:608:42"/>10. Living creatures have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds of nourishment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their <hi>age,</hi> for in their mothers or Dammes bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moysture is their food, after Birth milke, then meate and drinke; and being old, they love sollid savory food.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But whether nourishment may not onely by the mouth, but also outwardly bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is chiefly considerable. For if Baths of Milke in hot Feavers and Consumptions were used, and some Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hold that nutritive Glisters might bee purposely made, then such nourishment recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not by the stomacke, but outwardly, may supply dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions weaknesse in <hi>Age.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. Flames suddainly blazing, and weake, doe dry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, and parch the Body: but strong flames dissolve and melt the body, making it moist and solt.</p>

               <p n="9">9. Such spirits as are more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull to abate, and subject hard stubborne humours, than to avoyd thinne and prepared humours, will keepe the body lusty and strong.</p>

so Bees wanting <hi>Honey,</hi> and <hi>Butter-flies</hi> and <hi>Flesh-flyes</hi> do live by sleep.</p>

               <p>Voluntary Extasies, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed profound Meditations, joyned with a quiet minde, doe <hi>thicken</hi> the spirits more than sleepe, <hi>making</hi> them rest from outward operations, as sleepe doth. So much of sleep.</p>
               <p n="79">79. Violent wearisome exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and motions, as Running, Tennis, Fencing, are not

               <p>Some of the affections and passions of the minde doe shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the life of man, and some doe cause <hi>long life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="80">80. By <hi>exceeding great joy</hi> the spirits are made thinne, loose, and weake, but by familiar common Recreations they are not loosened, but <hi>streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened.</hi>

               <p n="93">93.

               <p n="94">94.

               <p n="95">95. <hi>Ficinus</hi> saith, that Old men should comfort their spirits with the actions of their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and youth, being a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation proper to <hi>Age.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:608:96"/>
the remembrance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Education together is pleasant in conversation, and the place of Education is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with delight. So that the Emperour <hi>Vespasian</hi> would not alter his Fathers house, being but a meane building, because the old House did put him in remembrance of his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: and besides, on festivall Dayes hee would drinke in a Silver-tip'd wooden Cup, which was his Grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p n="96">96. Also an alteration of life for the better, is acceptable and delightfull to the Spirits. Therefore Youth and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood having beene spent in pleasures proper and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to those Ages, Old age should enjoy new delights,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:608:97"/>
especially moderate ease. Therefore Noble-men in their Age should live a reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red kind of life, as <hi>Cassiodorus,</hi> having beene in great favour with the <hi>Gothish</hi> Kings of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and accounted the soule and life of their Affaires, at fourescore yeeres of age reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Monastery, living there to 110. yeeres of Age, and there dyed. But such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrement should be before the body bee decayed, and disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for then all changes, though for the better, doe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten death: and a retyred life being undertaken, their minds and thoughts should not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to idlenesse, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in pleasant delightfull studies, or in building and planting,</p>

Lastly, the spirits are recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by labour willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, but consumed by action or labour performed with unwillingnesse.

and lusty, not mentioned by Physitians, hath beene more diligently handled, because the readiest and most compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way to <hi>prolong</hi> Life, is by renewing the Spirits, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king suddainly on the body, as vapours and passions doe worke on the spirits in a direct not indirect manner.</p>

               <head>The History.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe Exclusion or keeping out of the Ayre, doth in two respects <hi>lengthen life:</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:608:98"/>
First, because the outward Ayre animating the spirits, and being healthfull, doth next unto the inward spirits, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure the moysture of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, growing thereby dry, and withered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, by the Exclusion and keeping out of Ayre, the body being shut and closed, and not breathing forth at the pores, the detayned spirits by their working doe sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the hardnesse of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The reason hereof is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the infallible Axiom of the drynesse, the body being dryed by the emission and issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the spirits, but by their detayning melted and softned. Besides, it is a Position that all kind of heate doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:608:99"/>
make thin and moysten, and doth onely accidentally contract and dry.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Dwelling in Caves and Dennes, the Ayre receiving there no Sun-beames, doth lengthen life; for the ayre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not excited by heate, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wast and consume the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And by divers ancient Tombes and Monuments in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and other places, it is cleerely evident, that the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man was greater in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Ages</hi> than now, being of a great stature, and long-liv'd. <hi>Epimenides</hi> Cave is an ancient Fable. And as living in Caves was then usuall, so the <hi>Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> lived in Pillars, impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable by the Sun-beames, and the Ayre being unchangeable. The <hi>Anchorites, Simeon, Stilita,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:608:99"/>
                  <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Saba</hi> living in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, were very long-liv'd. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so moderne Anchorites have lived in walls and Pillars unto agreat <hi>Age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Dwelling on Mountaines is next to living in Caves; for the Sun-beames pierce not, nor penetrate into Caves, and on the tops of Mountaines have no reflexion, and little strength. But on Mountaines having a cleare pure ayre, and drye Vallies below, whence no Clouds or Vapours doe ascend, being like those mountaines encompassing <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> whereon people live to an hundred yeeres of <hi>Age,</hi> it is good dwelling.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Such an Ayre, either in Caves, or on Mountaines, is not naturally praedatory, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:608:100"/>
but our common Ayre being of a wasting qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity through the warme heate of the Sunne, must be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and kept out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Ayre is excluded, or kept out by shutting or filling the pores.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Coldnesse of the Ayre, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of the skinne, washing in cold water, binders applyed to the <hi>skinne,</hi> as Masticke, Myrthe, and Myrtle, doe shut &amp; close the pores of the body.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Baths also made of astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent binding minerall waters, extracted from steele and glasse, doe strongly contract and close the <hi>skinne,</hi> but must be seldome used, especially in Summer.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Concerning filling; painting,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:608:100"/>
oyntments, oyles, and Poman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders doe preserve the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the body, as oyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colours and Varnish doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve wood.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The ancient <hi>Brittaines</hi> pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their bodies with Woad, and were very <hi>long-liv'd,</hi> and so were the <hi>Picts,</hi> from the like painting of their bodies called <hi>Picts,</hi> or living Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
               <p n="12">12.

               </p>
               <p n="15">15. The <hi>Irish</hi> doe weare saffro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Linnen, and shirts, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing long cleane, and leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening life. For <hi>Saffron</hi> being a great binder, oyly, and hot without sharpnesse, is very comfortable to the skinne and flesh. I remember that an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish man,</hi> being to goe to Sea, and having put a bag of <hi>Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron</hi> within his Doublet, next his Breast, to avoyd paying of Custome, was in that Voyage
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:608:101"/>
very healthfull, having been formerly alwayes sea-sicke.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Pure fine Linnen (according to <hi>Hypocrates</hi> advice) should be worne in Winter next unto the skinne: in Summer cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Linnen, and oyled; for the spirits being then very much exhaled and drawne forth, the pores of the skinne should bee closed and filled.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Annointing of the skin at the first rising out of Bed with Oyle-olive, or Oyle of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds mingled with Bay-salt, and Saffron, is good to leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then life. But this annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting must be with Wooll, or a soft spunge lightly done; not dropping on the body, but onely wetting the skinne.</p>
               <p n="18">18. For the body being drawne by a great quantity, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:608:102"/>
in a lesser quantity, should bee therefore lightly annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or instead thereof oyled shirts may be worne.</p>
               <p n="19">19. But the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> formerly using this annointing with Oyle, left off now in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> lived not longer in those <hi>Ages,</hi> being used by all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Fencers, onely after Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, hot Baths being of a contrary operation opening the pores by unctions and oyntments shut together and closed. Therefore Bathing without Annoynting is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthfull, but Annoynting without Bathing is very good. Besides, precious Oyntments were then used for delicacy and delight, not for health, or to lengthen life, as <hi>Virgil</hi> sayd:
<q>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:608:102"/>
                     <l>Nec Cassia liquidi corrumpitur usus Olivi:</l>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Nor doth the use of Oyle decay,</l>
                        <l>By using precious <hi>Cassia.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Annoynting is healthfull to <hi>keepe</hi> out cold in Winter, and <hi>good</hi> to <hi>keepe in</hi> the spirits in the Summer from loosening, and defend them from the praedatory devouring power of the ayre.</p>
               <p n="21">21. In annoynting with <hi>good Oyle,</hi> being good to <hi>prolong</hi> Life, foure Cautions arising from foure discommodities are observable.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The first discommodity is, that suppressing of sweat may breed diseases out of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious Humours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not prevented by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and Glisters. For
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:608:103"/>
swearing, though healthfull, doth weaken nature, and <hi>shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> life; but <hi>moderate Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> work on the <hi>humours,</hi> not the spirits, as sweat doth.</p>
               <p n="23">23. The second discommodity is, that by heating and enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the body, the enclosed spirits venting not forth by breathing, may become hot. This inconvenience is preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a coole dyet, and by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten taking such coolers, as in the operation of blood shal be mentioned.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Thirdly, annoynting may make the Head heavy; for all outward filling, striking back the vapours, doth drive them backe towards the Head: but <hi>Purgatives</hi> and <hi>Glisters,</hi> and closing the mouth of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle with restrictive binders,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:608:103"/>
and combing and rubbing the head with Lye, to cause the exhalations, and using exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises to vent humours by the pores of the skin, doe all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this inconvenience.</p>
               <p n="25">25. The fourth discommodity being of a subtiler nature, is the increasing of the detayned spirits by shutting the pores; for new spirits being without any venting of the old conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually generated and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, would feed on, and waste the body; but this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is erronious, for the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being confined, are dull, (and venting by motion as Flame) are not so active and generative to increase in heate like a hot flame, but slow in motion: besides, this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience may be remedied by
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:608:104"/>
coolers, steeped in oyle of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Myrtle, but <hi>Cassia,</hi> and heaters must bee shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p n="26">26. The linings of apparell for exhausting and drawing the Body, should not be of a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery but oyly substance; and therefore Bayes and woollen linings are better than Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen. And sweete powders sooner loose their sent among Linnen, than among Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; Linnen beeing soft and cleane, but not so healthfull as Woollen.</p>
               <p n="27">27. The wild <hi>Irish</hi> beginning to grow sicke, doe presently take the sheets of their Beds, and afterwards wrappe themselves in the woollen Blankets.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Carded Wooll worne next the <hi>skin</hi> in Britches and Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:608:104"/>
is very good.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Accustomed Ayre wasts not the Body so much as change of Ayre: Therefore poore men living in Cottages, and never changing their Dwellings, are commonly long-liv'd. But in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, the Spirits beeing fresh and lively change of Ayre is good, foure yeerely remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings beeing sufficient, that so neither Travayle, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall residence in one place may proove wearisome. So much of excluding or keeping out, and avoyding the praeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory devouring power of the Ayre.</p>

               <head>The History.</head>
               <p>THe two Operations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing have (as Actives to Passives) Relation to the former, which endeavoured to keepe the spirits and ayre from wasting the body, as these shew how to make the blood, moysture, and body lesse subject to depraedation and wasting: but Blood wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the moysture and limbes, three powerfull rules concerning the operation on
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:608:105"/>
the Blood shall bee first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. First, <hi>Blood</hi> being cold is lesse dissipable, and subject to scattering abroad. There are two coolers more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the following <hi>Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> than Julips or Potions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In Youth Glisters not <hi>purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> or <hi>cleansing,</hi> but onely <hi>refrigerative, cooling,</hi> and <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> made of the juyce of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce, Purslane, Liverwort, Sevegreene, or House-leeke, Fleawort-seed, with a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate opening decoction, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a little Camphire: but in <hi>Age,</hi> instead of House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeke and Purslane, the juyce of Borage and Endive may be used, and these Glisters must be an Houre or more retained.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Secondly, in Summer a Bath
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:608:106"/>
may be made of sweete luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme water, and new whey, and Roses, insteade of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Mercury, Milke, and such like mollifiers and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Annoynt the Body with Oyle and thickning substances before Bathing, for receiving the refrigerating quality of the coolers, and repelling the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the pores of the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not shut too close, lest out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cold strongly closing &amp; shutting the Body, doe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cooling, and rather stirre up heate.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Bladders also apply'd with Decoctions and cooling juy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the inferiour Region of the Body, beneath the Ribs downward, are a kind of Bathing, whereby the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:608:106"/>
being excluded, the Refrigerating quality, or Coolenesse is onely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The third Rule doth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualifie the substance of the Blood, making it firmer and lesse subject to Dissipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and scattering abroad, or to the working heate of the spirits.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To effect this Operation, powder of Gold, or Leafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Gold, or powder of Pearle, precious Stones and Corrals, are good; being therefore much esteemed by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians, Grecians,</hi> and also Modernes. Therefore to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fantasticall Opinions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation being made into the substance of the Blood, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and heate having no power
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:608:107"/>
to worke thereon, putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and drying would bee thereby prevented, and Life <hi>Prolonged;</hi> yet divers Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are observable: First let them bee exactly pulveriz'd, and made into powder; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, let their malignant quality, hurtfull to the veines, be taken away: thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware lest their long abode in the body, being taken with meate, or otherwise received, doe breed dangerous obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Bowels: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to avoyd Repletion, or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the veines, let them be seldome used.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Therefore take them fasting, in White-wine mingled with a little oyle of Almonds, and afterward use some exercise.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In this operation use Pearles,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:608:107"/>
Corrall, and Gold; for all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mettals, having some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant quality, are not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly pulveriz'd, or made into powder, and the powder of cleere <hi>grasse greene stones</hi> is bad, being a Corrosive.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But <hi>drugges</hi> of wood may be more safely and effectually used in <hi>Infusions</hi> and <hi>Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> being good to make the <hi>Blood</hi> firme, and not dangerous for <hi>breeding</hi> of Obstructions; and their <hi>Infusions</hi> being taken in Dyet, or Drinke, having no <hi>dregs,</hi> doe easily pierce into the veines.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Drugges</hi> of Wood are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Oke, and Vine; but hot woods having in them any Rozzen, or Gumme, are not good: but dry Rosemary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalkes, being a shrub as long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livd
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:608:108"/>
as many Trees, and such a quantity of Ivy-stalkes as will not make the Potion unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory may be used.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Drugs of wood</hi> may be also boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Broths, infused into Ale, or Wine before they be setled or refined: But <hi>Guiacum,</hi> and such <hi>Drugges</hi> must bee put in before the Broaths are boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that the substance of the firmer parts of the Wood being dissolved, may remaine in the Broath: but whether Ash bee good in Potions is uncertaine. So much of the Operation on the Blood.</p>

               <head>The History.</head>
               <p n="1">1. TWo kinds of Bodies (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning living creatures) are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consumed: hard bodies, as Mettals and Stones; fat, as Oyle and Waxe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore the moysture of the Body must bee hardened, and made fatty or dewy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moysture is hardened by firme foode, by cold thicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the skinne and flesh, and by exercise compacting the juyce, that it may not bee soft and frothy.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:608:109"/>4. Beefe, Porke, Venison, Goat, Kid, Swanne, Goose, and Woode-pigeons, especially beeing powdred, also dryed Salt-fish, olde Cheese, and the like, are firme sollid meates.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Oaten bread, or Miscelline bread made of Pease, Rye, and Barley, is more sollid than wheaten bread, and the course Wheaten bread, or browne bread that is full of Brane, is sollider than White bread made of purer flower.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Orcades</hi> feeding on fish, and beeing generally fish-ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are <hi>long liv'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Monkes and Hermites li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sparingly on drye foode, commonly attayned to a <hi>great age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:608:109"/>8. Pure water beeing mingled with Wine or Drinke, hardens the bodies moisture, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Spirit of the water is dull and piercing, <hi>Nitre</hi> may be there with mingled. And so much for the firmnesse of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment.</p>
               <p n="9">9. People living abroad in the open ayre, the cold <hi>thickning</hi> their <hi>skinne</hi> and <hi>flesh,</hi> no <hi>longer liv'd</hi> than Dwellers in houses; and in cold Countries, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants attaine unto a greater <hi>Age,</hi> than in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Many thicke cloathes on the bed, or backe, doe loosen and soften the body.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Washing the body in colde Baths, doth <hi>lengthen life,</hi> but hot Baths are very bad. Baths of binding Minerall
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:608:110"/>
waters were formerly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p n="12">12. By an easie jdle Life without exercise, the flesh is made dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipable and soft, being by stout exercises used without exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive sweating and wearinesse, compacted &amp; hardned. Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is also a good exercise, &amp; generally all exercises abroad, are better than within the house.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Frications by a kind of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise fetching out, not hardning nourishment shall be hereafter handled in its proper and due place.</p>
               <p n="14">14. To make hard moysture, oily, and dewy, is a perfecter worke than hardning, being attended with no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereas hardners of moysture, staying the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:608:110"/>
and hindering the Reparation, and Renewing of Nourishment, do thereby fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and hinder <hi>long Life.</hi> But oilie and juycy Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by bedewing the Body, is lesse dissipable, and more reparable.</p>
               <p n="15">15. This Dewy fat moysture of the Body is no tallowy fatnesse, but a Radicall Dew diffused and spread through the body.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Oily fat meates are not converted agayne into fat, perfect Substances returning not agayne into one and the same Substance, but Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment doth after matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Digestion breede an oy lines in the bodies moisture.</p>
               <p n="17">17. For oyle and fat alone, and also in mixture and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:608:111"/>
are hardly dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and wasted. For water is sooner consumed and Dryed than oyle alone, sticking lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in paper or a Napkin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be Dried.</p>
               <p n="18">18. To breede this oylinesse in the body, roasted or baked meate, is better than boyled or stewed, or dressed in any kinde with Water, more oyle beeing Distilled and extracted out of drye substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than moist.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And generally all sweete things doe moysten the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with this oylinesse, as Sugar, Honey, sweete Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Pine-Apples, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacke-nuts, Dates, Raysons, and figs; but all sower, salt, sharpe meates doe breede no dewy oylinesse.</p>
               <p n="20">
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:608:111"/>20. Also Seeds, Nuts, and roots, the <hi>Maniches</hi> using no other dyet, are good with meat &amp; in Sawces, for all kinde of bread beeing the confirmer of meats is made of Seedes or rootes.</p>
               <p n="21">21. But Drinke, being the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, carrying downe meate, doth especially moisten and soften the body. Therefore Drinkes not sharpe or sower, but ripe and cleere are best, as Wine (beeing as the old wise sayd in <hi>Plautus</hi>) toothles with age; also stale Beere and Ale beeing not sharpe but ripe and pleasant.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>Metheglin</hi> strong and olde is a good Drinke, but bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incorporated with Sugar insteede of Honey which is sharpe, as the Water is
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:608:112"/>
by Chymists thence extracted would bee better, espeoially after a yeare or sixe moneths age, the rawnesse of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beeing then gone, and the Sugar growne subtil and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
               <p n="23">23. But olde Wine and stale Drinke beeing subtill and full of oylinesse, are also Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and sharpe, and not so Good; therefore Porke or Venison well boyled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid into Vessels of Wine, Ale, or Beere, the spirits of the wine and of other lyquors feeding thereon will lose their sharpnes.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Also Beere or Ale, bread of Wheate, Barley, and Pease, with Potato roots, Bur rootes, and other sweete rootes, to the quantity of a third part, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:608:112"/>
to prolong <hi>Life,</hi> than drink made onely of Graine.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Flowers also being not sharp or biting, are good sawces and sallets for meate, as Ivy-flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers with Vinegar taste plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly, and Marigold leaves, and Betony flowers in broaths.

               <head>The Comment.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ALL bodies desire to <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similate</hi> and <hi>convert Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> into their owne <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Flame, Spirit, &amp; Ayre,</hi> being thinne and <hi>Spirituall,</hi> doe couragiously performe this worke, but thicke and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:608:127"/>
grosse substances very weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this desire of assimilating being by a stronger desire of rest and ease restrayned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For this Desire of assimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, restrained in the Body, is ineffectuall, untill it bee by heate and <hi>Spirit,</hi> freed, excited and actuated; and therefore livelesse bodies doe not assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate, and living Creatures assimilate, Disgest, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert into their owne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. More heate is required to make hard Bodies assimilate and Disgest, therefore the bodies parts growne hard with <hi>Age</hi> must bee softned, and heate then weake encreased, for helping Disgestion. But of preventing the bodies hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, some Rules were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:608:127"/>
and others shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heereafter for softning the parts.</p>
               <p>For increasing heate take this Rule or Axiom.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The act of Assimilation inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and provoked by heate, a very accurate subtile motion, and most powerfull when bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily motion, the disturber thereof, ceases. For a substance of one kind wil not separate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to parts of divers kinds being moved; as Curd will not rise, nor the Whey sinke downe, the Milke being gently stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Also running water, nor any water or liquor, will not put refie being continually mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and shaked. Therefore by this Reason this conclusion is inferr'd.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Assimilation is performed
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:608:128"/>
and perfected chiefly in sleepe and rest, especially towards Morning after good digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore sleeping warme, using oyntments towards mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or provoking of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heate by an oyled shirt, and sleeping afterward again, are all very good. So much of the last act of Assimilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or converting food into the substance of the body.</p>

               <head>The History.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AS <hi>Medea</hi> in the Fable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make <hi>Pelias</hi> young, by boyling the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his dissected body in a Kettle with medicinable <hi>Drugges:</hi> so heere in renewing of <hi>Age,</hi> the inward parts must bee distinguished, and divided with judgement, and by more particular wayes than the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy softned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But this dissection must be in some respect performed, not with any Razour, but with
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:608:129"/>
judgement; for the bowells and inward parts being diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, their softning is not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the same meanes, but they must be particularly softned, and by other wayes than those which belong unto the whole Body, which shall be first declared.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Soften the body with Baths and oyntments, and the like, according to these following observations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Baths and Oyles soften live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse bodies, attracting and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in liquors, but not living bodies, working outward.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore common mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, softning Baths doe rather draw than soften, and loosen rather than harden the body.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The best Baths and Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to soften the body, must
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:608:129"/>
have these three properties.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Their substance must be like unto the Bodies substance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an outward nourishing power.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Secondly, that they bee compounded with some pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>drugs,</hi> infusing the power of other nourishing <hi>drugs</hi> into the body.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thirdly, they must have (though in a lesser quantity) some binding <hi>Ingredients,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not sharpe, or sower, but oyly, and comfortable, that the other <hi>Ingredients,</hi> by the exhaling of the body, bee not hinderd in <hi>working,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Body tender, but may have by the binding of the <hi>skinne,</hi> and shutting the pores, a <hi>stronger operation.</hi>

               <p n="16">16. But besides these bloody Baths and Oyntments, there are other Baths more hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, cleanly, and effectuall.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Baths may be made of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing substances like unto mans body, as Beefe-sewet, Hogs grease, Deeres sewet, Oysters, Milke, Butter, whites of <hi>egges,</hi> wheat-flower, sweet wine, Sugar, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theglin.</p>

               <p n="20">20. For the powerfull <hi>working</hi> of this Bath, foure Rules are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable.</p>
               <p n="21">21. First, before <hi>bathing,</hi> rub and annoint the Body with Oyle, and Salves, that the Baths moistning heate and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue may penetrate into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and not the liquors wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part: Then sit two Houres in the Bath; after <hi>Bathing</hi> wrap the Body in a seare-cloth made of <hi>Masticke, Myrrh, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> and <hi>Saffron,</hi> for stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perspiration or <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> of the pores, untill the softning of the <hi>body,</hi> having

layne thus in seare-cloth twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foure houres, <hi>bee growne</hi> solid and hard. Lastly, with an oyntment of Oyle, Salt, and Saffron, the seare-cloth <hi>being</hi> taken off, annoint the <hi>body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. And some dayes the Bath must be renewed with plasters and oyntments in the aforesaid manner, and this way of soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning must continue a moneth.</p>
               <p n="23">23. In <hi>bathing</hi> a good dyet must <hi>be kept,</hi> and warmth, and warm drinks used.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Fomentations or nourishing of naturall heate by the warmth of living <hi>bodies</hi> is good. <hi>Ficinus</hi> saith, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was cherished by the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-warmth of a young mayd, who <hi>being Annoynted</hi> after the <hi>Persian</hi> manner with

               </p>
               <p n="3">3.
