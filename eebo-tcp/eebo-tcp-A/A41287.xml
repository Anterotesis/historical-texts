            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

SPEECH
OF
THE HONOVRABLE
NATHANAEL FIENNES,
In the House of COMMONS the
9. of February. 1640,</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TWo things have fallen into debate this
day.</p>
            <p>The first, concerning the <hi>Londoners</hi>
Petition, whether it should be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or no.</p>
            <p>The other concerning the Governement of the
Church, by Arch-bishops, Bishops, &amp;c. whether it
should be countenanced or no?</p>
            <p>For the first, I doe not understand by any thing,
that I have yet heard, why the <hi>Londoners</hi> Petition
should not be committed, or countenanced.</p>
            <p>The exceptions that are taken against it, are from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96528:3"/>
the irregularities of the deliverie of it, and from the
Subject matter contained in it.</p>
            <p>For the first, it is alledged that the long taile of
this blazing starre, is ominous, and that such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Petitioners, and such a number that brought
the Petition to the House, was irregular; hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I answere, that the fault was either in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Petitioners, or in their carriages, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors:
if a multitud find themselvs agreived, why
it should be a fault in them to expresse their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
more then in one, or a few, I cannot see, nay,
to mee it seemes rather a reason that their Petitions
should bee committed, and taken into serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
for thereby they may receive satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though all be not granted that they desire. But
if wee shall throw their Petition behinde the doore,
and refuse to consider it, that it may seeme an act of
will in us. And whether an act of will in us, may
not produce an act of will in the people, I leave it to
your consideration. Sure I am, acts of will, are more
dangerous there then here, because usually they
are more tumultuous. All lawes are made, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
for the quiet and peace of a Kingdome; and a
law may bee of such indifferent nature manie times,
that it is a good reason to alter it, onely, because a
great number desires it, if there were nothing else
in it, and therefore I doe not see that the number
of Petitioners is any good reason, why it should not
be committed, but rather the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Now for their carriage, there came indeede, three
or foure hundred of the 15000, some of the better
sort of them, and there might be good reason for it.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96528:3"/>
I have heard that there was brought a Petition to
some privie Counsellours, with a thousand hands
to it, and being brought onelie with six men, they
were answered, that they six might write those
thousand hands; if there were a thousand that joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Petition, why did they not come too?
And wee heard it objected but the other daie, in this
House against the Ministers Petition, that there
were indeed seven or eight hundred names to it,
but two hands onelie. Therefore it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause, that a considerable number should come,
with a Petition signed by so manie, but for any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
in their carriage, I saw none; for upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
in one word from this House, they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
retired to their dwellings. As for the subject
matter of the Petition, three exceptions are taken
against it.</p>
            <p>First, that divers things are contemptible in it,
as that about <hi>Ovide Amore,</hi> set forth in English,
and other such things.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, that in manie things their discourse
was altogether irrationall, for that they argue from
personal faults of Bishops against the office it selfe of
Bishops, and in other things argue from effects that
proceed from it by accident, as if they did flie out
of it.</p>
            <p>And in the last place, that their praier and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
is bold and presumptuous, desiring so boldly
an abolition of standing lawes. To the first I answer,
that some things may seeme contemptible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which are not so in their causes, nor in their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96528:4"/>
effects, as the suffering of such lascivious Pamphlets
to be printed, and published, when other profitable
writings are suppressed, doth discover a principle,
that loosenesse and prophanesse, (which will helpe
to bring in superstition) is more sutable to their
hierachy then the contrarie, which makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive
at such things, as are apt to produce loosenesse
and lewdnesse, and this is no contemptible effect,
nor doth it proceed from a contemptible cause.</p>
            <p>In the next place, for that which seemes irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
in the way of their discoverie, divers things
may seeme to bee personall faults, which indeede
are derived unto the persons from the office, or from
the circumstances thereof, I meane their revenues,
and dignities, on the one side, and the Ceremonies
on the other side. For most of the things complained
of, as silencing, and thrusting out of godly and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Preachers, bringing in Innovations in doctrine,
and worship, and the like; although they may seeme
personall and accidental faults, yet if wee follow
them to their last resort, wee shall finde, that their
worldly wealth and dignities stirre them up to doe
this, that their sole and arbitrarie power over the
Clergie, and in matter Ecclesiasticall, enable them
to effect it, and the Ceremonies both new and old,
serve as instruments, and meanes, whereby they
effect it.</p>
            <p>In the last place, that their prayer in the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Petition, is bold, or presumptuous, I do
not see there is anie reason so to esteeme of it: for
if they had taken upon them to have altered any
thing upon their owne authority, or had imperiously
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96528:4"/>
required the <hi>Parliament</hi> to doe it, then it might
deserve such a stile, but when they come as humble
suppliants, by way of Petition, desiring the altering
of lawes, that haue beene found burdensome unto
them, And that of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> where, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
onely old lawes may bee repealed, and new lawes
may bee made, they come in the right manner, to
their right and proper place, and therefore have
done nothing, boldly, or presumptuously, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
and regularly, and therefore ought not to
receive any checke or discouragement, in the way
that they have taken.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, concerning the Government of the
Church, by Arch-Bishops, Bishops, &amp;c. which also
hath beene spoken unto, whereas it is desired that
the evils, and inconveniences should bee shewed,
which arise not from the persons, but from the
office it selfe of Bishops, I shall apply my discourse
particularly to that point. But first, I shall crave
leave to say a word or two, in answere to what hath
beene alledged for the credit of the Government
by Bishops. First, that it is as ancient as Christian
Religion, and that it hath continued ever since the
time of Christ and his Apostles; as for this, I doe
not pretend to have so much knowledge in antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as to confute this out of the fathers and ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
histories, (although there are that undertake
that) onely one sentence I have often heard cited
out of Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> that in the primitive times,
<hi>Omnia communi Clericorum Concilio regebantur:</hi> and
truely so farre as the Acts of the Apostles, and the
new Tastament goeth, which was the ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96528:5"/>
and most primitive time of Christianity; I
could never finde there any distinction betweene a
Bishop and a Presbyter, but that they were one and
the very same thing. In the next place, that which is
alledged for the credit of episcopacy, is, that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
and martyrs were many of them Bishops,
and practized many of those things now complained
of, and that in other reformed Churches where Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
are not, they are desired. For the martyrs
and reformers of the Church that were Bishops. I
doe not understand that, that was any part of their
reformation, nor of their martyrdome; I have read
that whereas <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper</hi> had some difference
betweene them in their life time about these things,
when they came both to their martyrdome, hee that
had formerly been the patron of this Hierarchie and
Ceremonies, told his Brother, that therein his foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse
had contended with his wisedome. As for
that which is said, that other reformed Churches
where they have not Bishops, yet they are desired,
I will not deny but some among them may desire
Bishoprickes, I meane the Dignities and Revenues
of bishops, but that they desire bishops, as thinking it
the fittest, and best Government of the Church, I
cannot beleeve, for if they would have Bishops,
why doe they not make themselves Bishops? I know
not what hindreth, why they might not have Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
when they would. In the last place, for that
which is alledged in relation to the Government of
this Kingdome that Bishops are so necessarie, as that
the King cannot well let them goe with the safetie
of Monarchy, &amp; that if Bishops be taken away, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96528:5"/>
or something must come in the roome therof.
And if Kings should be subject thereunto and should
happen to bee excommunicated thereby, that after
they would bee little esteemed, or obeyed as Kings,
for this if it shall be cleared, as it is affirmed, that
the removall of the Government by Bishops, or of
any thing therein do any thing strike at Monarchie,
I shall never give my vote, nor consent thereunto as
long as I live. But to cleare that this is not so, I offer
to your consideration, that by the law of this land,
not onely all Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, but also
all superiority, &amp; preheminence over the ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
state, is annexed to the imperiall Crown of this
Realme, and may bee granted by Commission un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great seale, to such persons as his Majestie
shall thinke meete: now, if the King should grant
it unto a certaine number of Commissioners, equall
in authoritie, as hee may doe, this were an abolition
of Episcopacie, and yet not diminution of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;
but the truth is, Episcopacie is a kinde of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie
under a Monarchie, and is therein altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unlike the civill Government under his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie:
for the King being a common head over the
ecclesiasticall state and the civill, we shall finde that
in the exercise of civill jurisdiction, in all Courts
under his Majestie, it is <hi>Aristocraticall,</hi> and placed
in manie, and not in one, as appeareth in this high
Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the inferiour Courts of
Westminster-Hall, &amp; in the Sizes, and Sessions in the
countrie, which are held by manie Commissioners,
and not onely by one, or his deputies, and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
as it is in the exercise of ecclesiasticall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goverment.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96528:6"/>
As to the point of excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that it did dissolve naturall and civill bonds
of dutie, as it doth not, it might indeed bee as terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Princes, as it is represented. But I reason
thus, either princes are subject to excommunication,
or they are not: if they bee not, then they need as
little to fear a Presbyterie, or an Assembly, as a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
in that respect; if they bee, they have as much
to feare from Bishops, at leastwise from Bishops in
their Convocations, as from Presbyters in their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
and so much the more, because they have
formerly felt the thunderbolts of those of that
stampe, but never from this latter sort. And now
Sir, I proceed to represent unto you the evills, and
inconveniences that doe proceed from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Ceremonies of the Church, and truely in
my opinion the chiefe and principall cause of all
the evills which wee have suffered, since the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in this Church and State, hath proceeded
from that division which so unhappily hath sprung
up amongst us, about Church Government, and the
ceremonies of the Church, and from which part in
that division, I beleeve, it will appeare in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
I know well there is a great division, &amp; that
upon greater matters, betweene us and the Papists,
and I am not ignorant that there have been great
and sore breaches, made upon our civil liberties, and
the right of our proprieties.</p>
            <p>But yet still I returne to my former position, that
the chiefe and most active cause hath proceeded
from the Government and Ceremonies of the
Church, and that those other causes have either fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96528:6"/>
into it, and so acted by it, or issued out of it, and
so acted from it. As for poperie, I conceive that to
have beene a cause that hath fallen into this, and
acted by it, for at the reformation, it received such
a deadly wound by so many sharpe lawes enacted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, that had it not beene enlivened by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
amongst us, it could never have had influence
upon our Church and State to have troubled them,
as this day we feele: but finding that in this division
amongst us, one partie had neede of some of their
principalls, to maintain their Hierarchie, together
with their worldly pompe and ceremonies, which
are appurtenances thereunto, from hence they
first conceived a ground of hope, and afterwards
found meanes of successe, towards the introducing
againe of their superstition and idolatrie into this
Realme: and they wrought so diligently upon this
foundation, that they have advanced their building
very farre, and how neere they were to set up the
Roofe, I leave it to your consideration. As for the
evills which wee have suffered in our civill liberty,
and the right of our proprieties, I conceive they
have proceeded out of this, and so acted from it, for
if there had beene no breaches of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> there
would have beene no need to have had recourse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those broken cisternes that can hold no water;
but there being a stoppage of Parlamentary sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
that was an occasion of letting in upon us, such
an inundation of monopolies, and other illegall
taxes, and impositions, accompanied with many
other heavy and sore breaches of our liberties. Now
there needed not to have beene any breaches of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96528:7"/>
               <hi>Parliaments,</hi> had there not been something disliked
in them, and what was that? it could not be any of
these civill matters that bred the first difference, for
they have proceeded out of it, therefore I conceive
it was this. The Prelates with their adherents (the
Papists also concurring with them for their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest)
did alwaies looke upon <hi>Parliaments</hi> with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
eye, as no friend to their offices and functions,
at leastwise to their benefices and dignities, and
therefore (some of them having alwayes had the
grace to be too neere to the Princes eares) they
have alwaies endeavoured to breed a disaffection in
Kings from <hi>Parliaments,</hi> as the presse and pulpit doe
aboundantly witnesse, and ballads too, made by
some of them, upon the breaches of <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
But wee have a fresh and bleeding instance of this, in
the confirmation in his Majesties name, which they
procured to be prefixed before their new booke of
Cannons, wherein they have endeavoured to make
this impression upon his Majesties royall mind, that
the authors and fomentors of the jealousies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the new rites and ceremonies lately intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into the Church, which wee call innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
did strike at his royall Person, as if hee were
perverted in his religion, and did worship God in a
superstitious way, and intended to bring in some
innovation in matter of Religion. Now Sir, who are
the authors of those jealousies? did they not come as
complaints in the petitions from the bodies of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Countries the last <hi>Parliament,</hi> and from more
this present <hi>Parliament,</hi> and who were the fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of those jealousies? did not the generall sence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96528:7"/>
of the last <hi>Parliament</hi> concurre in it, that they were
innovations, and that they were suspitious, as intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory
to superstition? nay, I appeale to all those
that heare me, which are drawne from all parts of
the Kingdome, whether this bee not the generall
sence of the greatest and most considerable part of
the whole Kingdome? I beseech you then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what kinde offices these men have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the King and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> betweene the
King and the Kingdome, I speak of the greatest and
most considerable part, as giving denomination to
the whole. And now Sir, as we have cast our eye
backeward, if wee will looke forwards, how doe
the clouds thicken upon us, and what distractions,
yea what dangers doe they threaten us withall?
proceeding still from the same roote of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and ceremonies: and truely as things now
stand: I see but two wayes, the one of destruction,
the other of satisfaction, destruction I meane of the
opposite party to the Bishops and the Ceremonies,
and reducing of all to Cannonicall obedience, by
faire meanes or by foule; this way hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
tried, and what effect it hath brought forth in
our neighbour Kingdome, wee well know, and it is
like to produce no very good effect in this Kingdom,
it mens scruples and reasons in that behalfe, shall be
only answered with prisons, and pillories, and hard
censures, that I may speake most softly of them. I
hold therefore, that the other way of satisfaction
is the safest, the easiest, and the onely way. And that
is to take into consideration, the severall heads of
the evills, which are causes of these complaints, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96528:8"/>
to find out, and apply the proper remedies thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
For the furtherance whereof, I shall make bold
with your patience (which I am very unwilling to
tire, but must tire my own conscience, if I should not
discharge it upon this occasion) to represent a brief
model of the several heads and springs, from whence
the evils which are causes of these complaints, doe
naturally or occasionally arise. The evills complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of, doe either arise from persons, or from things,
those faults that are personal, are besides the point
that I intend to speak to, there is one onely remedy
for them, that is, by punishment and removal of such
persons, and the putting of better in their room. As
for those evils which proceed from things, they also
are remedied by a removal of such things as are evil,
and the putting of better in their room; the evils and
inconveniences of this kind do principally flow, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the Clergies offices and functions, or from
their benefices and dignities; those that arise
from their offices and functions, doe arise naturally
either from the lawes and constitutions, whereby,
and according unto which, they exercise their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and functions, or from the Government it selfe,
wherein they exercise those functions. The faults
that I note in the ecclesiasticall lawes, are that they
hold too much of the civill law, and too much of
the ceremoniall law: of the civill law, in respect of
all those titles concerning wills, and legacies,
tithes, marriages, adulteries, which all belonging
to the civil jurisdiction, and are no more of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
consideration, then rapes, thefts, fellonies, or
treasons may bee. Sir it is good that every bird
should have his owne feather, and I remember
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96528:8"/>
when one came to our <hi>Saviour Christ, to desire him
that hee would cause his Brother to divide the inheritance
with him, hee asked him, who made him a judge of such
things:</hi> and may not we aske who made them, that
take themselves to bee successours of Christ and his
Apostles, Judges of such things? Many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
arise from hence, first, that the mindes of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
men, are inured unto civill dominion, and to
meddle with civill matters. Secondly, the manner
of their proceedings, is turned from a spirituall way
into the fashion of processes in temporall Courts.
And lastly, which is worst of all, by this meanes the
spirituall sword comes to be unsheathed about such
things as doe not at all fall under the stroake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Many are excommunicated for pigges, apples,
and nuts, and such like things; but the other fault
which I noted in the ecclesiasticall lawes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
pincheth us more, which is, that they
hold too much of the ceremoniall law. And heere
Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> give me leave to lament the condition
of this our Church of <hi>England,</hi> beyond that of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reformed Churches. A certain number of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
in the judgment of some men unlawful and
to bee rejected of all Churches, in the judgement of
all other reformed Churches to be rejected by them,
and in the judgement of our owne Churches but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
ceremonies, and yet what difference, yea,
what distractions have these indifferent ceremonies
raised amongst us? What hath deprived us of so
many faithfull, able, and godly ministers, since the
Reformation, as able and as fit in all other
respects to discharge that function, as any age
ever produced in the Christian World since the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96528:9"/>
time of the Apostles, I say what hath deprived us
of them, but these indifferent ceremonies? what
hath deprived us of so many thousand Christians
which desired (and in all other respects deserved)
to hold communion with us, I say what hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
us of them, and scattered them into I know
not what places and corners of the world, but these
indifferent ceremonies? What hath caused so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hard censures, and harder executions, but these
indifferent ceremonies? What hath occasioned
those calamities, and dangers, which we feele, and
which wee feare, but those indifferent ceremonies?
I shal say no more of them, but I pray God that now
at length it may please his Majestie with this his
great Counsel of <hi>Parliament,</hi> to take a view of them,
and if there be a necessitie to retaine them, let them
bee retained; but if not, then let us remove them,
before they ruine us. As to the evills and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
that arise out of the Government it selfe,
I should have noted something amisse, as well in the
<hi>legislative</hi> part, as in the <hi>executive</hi> part, but in the
former I am prevented, by what hath beene alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
voted concerning the power of making Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons:
which votes if they bee brought to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they will set us right in great part, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
for surely, before the power was neither in
the hands of such as were representative of that
which is truely the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor yet in
the hands of those that were truely representative
of the Clergie of <hi>England,</hi> if they were the whole
Church, as indeed they are not. As to the <hi>executive</hi>
part, which consisteth in the exercise of ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96528:9"/>
Jurisdiction, therein I note also two disorders,
Confusion, and Corruption, Confusion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
sword, with the Temporall; lay-men strike
with the Spirituall sword, and Spirituall men with
the Temporall sword; nay, out of the same mouth,
and at the same time proceedeth an excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a fine, or commitment, ot both: I will
not say positively, that it is unlawfull for Clergie
men to exercise civill Jurisdiction, because I know
it is a question, but yet such a question as hath beene
determined by divers Canons of generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
and by some that were made in Synods of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> that it is unlawfull, and that
upon grounds which are not contemptible.</p>
            <p>As first, that it is contrary to the precept and
practise of Christ and his Apostles. And secondly,
that it is not possible for one man to discharge two
functions, whereof either is sufficient to imploy the
whole man, especially that of the ministery so
great, that they ought not to entangle themselves
with the affaires of this world. A third ground not
so well observed generally, as in one part thereof,
is this, that Ministers of the Gospell, being sent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
to gaine the soules of men, they are to
gaine as great interest as possible may bee, in their
minds and affections: now wee know that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all men is such, that they are apt to thinke
hardly of those that are any authors of their paine
and punishment, although it bee in a way of justice,
&amp; therefore as it is well knowne, that Clergy men
are not to be present <hi>in judicio sanguinis,</hi> so the same
reason extends it selfe to the administration of all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96528:10"/>
civill jurisdiction, and therefore wee may observe
that our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> as he alwayes rejected all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
judicature, so on the other side, he went up
and downe healing mens bodies, and otherwise do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good to their outward estate, that his doctrine
might have a freer, and fairer passage into their
soules. For the corruption that I spoke of in the
exercise of Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, I do not mean
any personall corruption, but a deviation, or aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the prescript of the divine rule, and
though it bee not easie to finde what that is in all
particulars, yet it is not hard to say, what it is not,
and that I doubt may prove our case in divers
things. Ecclesiastical jurisdiction we know, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
either to the Clergy onely, and consisteth in
the Ordination, Admission, Suspension, and Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them, or else it extendeth to the whole
Church, and consisteth in excommunication and
absolution. As to the Ordination, Admission, Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension,
and Deprivation of Ministers, we see how
it is wholly at the pleasure of one man, and that of
one man proceeding in a manner arbitrarily, and
that of one man whose interest is concern'd in it,
that the doore should be shut against able and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
preaching Ministers, and a wide doore set open
to such as are unable, and unfit for that function:
many and great and dangerous evills arise from
hence. As first, that there is a constant farre and
fewd betweene the Ecclesiasticall State and the
Civill, betweene Prelates, and Parliaments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Cannon law, and the Common law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Clergy, and the Common-wealth, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96528:10"/>
from the disproportion, and dissimilitude
which is between the Civill and Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,
however it may seeme to some to agree
well enough, but the truth is, if wee consider his
Majesty as the Common-head over the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
State, as well as the Civill, wee shall finde that
in the exercise of all Civil jurisdiction, in all Courts
under his Majesty, the power is not in any one, or
his Deputies and Commissaries, as it is in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Government, in the severall Diocesses
throughout this Kingdome: if wee looke first upon
the highest and greatest Court, the high Court of
<hi>Parliament,</hi> we know that is a Counsell and a great
Counsel too. In like manner in the inferiour Courts
of Westminster-Hall, there are many Judges in the
point of law, and more in matter of fact, wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man is judged by twelve of equall condition
unto him, I meane the juries, which are Judges of
the fact, both in causes Civill and Criminall: and if
wee looke into the country, wee shall finde the Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Sizes, and other Courts held not by any
one, but by divers Commissioners. And in short,
in the Civil Government, every man from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to the least, hath some share in the Government
according to the Proportion of his Interest in the
Common-wealth, but in the Government of the
Church, all is in the hands of one man, in the several
Diocesses, or of his Chancellours, or Commissaries,
and hee exacts Canonicall obedience, to his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall
commands, with a totall exclusion of those
that notwithstanding have as much share in the
Church, and consequently as much Interest in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96528:11"/>
government of it, as they have in that of the Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monwealth.
(Sir) untill the Ecclesiastical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be framed something of another twist, and be
more assimilated unto that of the Common-wealth,
I feare the Ecclesiastical government will bee no
good neighbour unto the Civil, but will be still a
casting in of its leaven into it, to reduce that also to
a sole, absolute, and arbitrary way of proceeding:
And herein (Sir) I do not beleeve, that I utter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,
but what we have already found, and felt.</p>
            <p>A Second, and that a great evill, and of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
consequence, in this sole and arbitrary power
of Bishops over their Clergy is this, that they have
by that meanes a power, to place, and displace the
whole Clergie of their Diocesse at their pleasure:
and this is such a power, as for my part, I had rather
they had the like power over the Estate, and persons
of all within their Diocesse; for if I hold the one,
but at the will and pleasure of one man, (I meane
the Ministery, under which I must live) I can have
but little, or at least no certaine joy nor comfort in
the other. But this is not all, for if they have such
a power to mould the Clergie of their Diocesses, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their pleasure, we know what an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
they may have by them upon the people, and
that in a short time they may bring them to such
blindnesse, and so mould them also to their owne
wills, as that they may bring in what Religion they
please: nay, having put out our eyes, as the <hi>Philistins</hi>
did <hi>Sampsons,</hi> they may afterwardes make us grind,
and reduce us unto what slavery they please, either
unto themselves, as formerly they have done, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96528:11"/>
others, as some of them lately have beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enough to doe. Now whether it be safe to
walke upon Stilts on the top of the pinacles of the
Temple, upon so high <hi>precipices,</hi> as are the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, and conscience, (which may have
also a dangerous Influence upon our civil liberries)
I leave it to your consideration: for my part, I should
not thinke it safe, that such a power should be in any
one man, though you suppose him to be a very good
man.</p>
            <p>A third evil, and that of dangerous consequence,
is that the dore is shut against able and painefull
Preaching Ministers, and a wide doore set ope un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those that are unable, and unfit for that function,
and the Bishops interest is concerned in it, that it
should be so. Interest of honour, Interest of profit,
and Interest of power, Interest of credit; for they
see that those painefull Preachers carry away all
the credit from them, and they neither can nor will
doe the like themselves: they cannot by reason they
are so intangled with the affaires of this world, and
civill Jurisdiction; they will not, their great Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and honours make them so stately, that they
think it is not Episcopall to Preach often; and on
the other side, they are so far, and live so much at
their ease, that through idlenesse they cannot bring
their minds unto it, and so first ariseth envy against
those that doe take paines, and thence after spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
persecution. In the next place, their Interest
is concerned in matter of profit: for they suppose,
that if the credit of their <hi>Diana</hi> fall to the ground,
their gaine will after cease, and that the people wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96528:12"/>
thinke much that some men should take all the
paines, and other goe away with all the Profit.</p>
            <p>Lastly, their Interest is concerned in it, in
point of power, for they find that neither such
Preaching Ministers, nor their auditours, are so pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to yeeld blind Canonicall obedience, as others
are: and so it concernes them in point of power to
stop their mouthes. And now it must needes follow
by the rule of contraries, that it must be for their
profit, honour, and power, to set open a doore to
idle and unfit Ministers. But there are two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
which I will note wherein it concernes them
in their profits, to set the doore very wide open,
where there is no suspition of refractorinesse. First
we know Bishops have many times Livings in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendum
and pluralities: but there is hardly any,
but they have Impropriations, whereof they are to
see the cure discharged, and therefore it is for their
profit, that there may be good store of cheape Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
which cannot be very fit and able men: and
with such ordinarily, they furnish the cures of such
places, whereof they have the Impropriations. (Sir)
In the next place we know, that orders are not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but in a manner sold, for not onely the Bishop,
and his Register, but also his Vsher, his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,
his Butler, and Porter, and almost all his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
Servants must have their fees, before the poore
Clarke with his Box full of Orders, can passe the
Porters Lodge. I heare much of the legall Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which consisteth in the buying and selling of
Benefices, but whether this doth not approach nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to the Evangelicall Simony, which consisteth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96528:12"/>
in the buying and selling of the guifts of the holy
Ghost; I offer it to your consideration. Now (Sir)
for Excommunication and Absolution, all seemes
to be out of point, for Excommunication is neither
in right hands, nor exercised upon right grounds and
matters, nor in a right forme and maner, nor to
right ends, and then it is no marvaile, if it have
not right effects. (Sir) we know our Saviour hath
lodged it in the Church (for so runs the precept)
<hi>dic ecclesiae:</hi> now (Sir) that one man should be a
Church, soundes strangely in my eares. In the
next place (I beseech you Sir) consider about what
their Spirituall Sword is exercised, about things
no way lying under the stroke thereof? A man
shall be Excommunicated for a Pig, or for an Apple,
and such like things? I heard once a Gentleman of
the civill Law, answere hereunto in this House, that
the Excommunication was not for the thing, but
for the contempt, and the lesse the thing was, that
was commanded, the greater was the contempt: If
this were so, sure the greater is the cruelty, to lay
command upon so small a matter, that draweth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it so deepe a censure, as to cast a man downe into
Hell. Suppose a Magistrate should command some
triviall matter, some ceremony or other, under
paine of Treason, and should proceed against the
Infringers of his command as Traytors, it were
much to be doubted whether the command did not
partake more of cruelty, then the disobedience of
contempt; for when authority shall so far loose it
selfe, as to lay so great a weight upon so small a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it rendereth it selfe contemptible, and then it is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96528:13"/>
no marvell (I had almost said) it is no fault, if it bee
contemned, having made it selfe contemptible.
Then Sir, for the forme of proceeding, it is no whit spirituall,
there is no fasting and prayer, no seeking
to reclaime the sinner, but rather it is after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of a summary Processe in a civill Court, nay
Sir, it is accompanied sometimes with an intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that no man shall buy, or sell, with the person
excommunicated, nor set him a worke, nor doe any
civill or naturall offices unto him. As wee had a
complaint brought in this <hi>Parliament,</hi> of a Son that
was excommunicated onely for repeating a Sermon
to his father, being an excommunicate person.
Now Sir, for the ends for which this censure is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted,
they are ordinarily to fetch in fees, or at
the best to bring men under Canonicall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which is the Ordinaries will and pleasure, and
I have sometimes seen a Minister pronounce an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
which hee held in one hand, and
presently after the absolution, which hee held in
the other, so the end of the excommunication was
the absolution, and the end of that was fees: (Sir)
for the honour of God, for the honour of our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
Church, and for the honour of the Christian
Religion, let the high and great censure of the
Church no longer lackey after fees, let not Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
any longer be cast to Sathan, in the name of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> for the non-payment of a groat. And now
Sir we may imagine what effects are lik to follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such premises, the great and dreadfull censure of
excommunication is thereby made contemptible,
and were it not for the civill restrains, and penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96528:13"/>
that follow upon it, no man would purchase an
absolution, though he might have it for a half pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
And I have heard of some that have thanked
the Ordinaries for abating, or remitting the fees of
the Courts: but I never heard of any that thanked
them, for reclayming their soules to repentance,
by their excommunications; (Sir) for absolution it
is relative to excommunication, and so labours of
the same diseases: onely one thing I shall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
note concerning absolution, (Sir) it is called
commutation of penance, but indeed it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the ordinance, making it void and of
none effect, and surely God never set his Ministers
to sell indulgences in his Church. The oath that is
to precede absolution, <hi>de parendo juri Ecclesiae et stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
&amp;c.</hi> hath already been sufficiently spoken unto,
in the debate about the Canons, and therefore
there will bee no neede of speaking more to that.
Now Sir, I am come to my last head, wherein I shall
bee very briefe, and that is concerning the evills
that arise out of the benefices and dignities of the
Clergy, the common cause being from the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the distribution of them, much resembling
a disease very ordinary at this time amongst chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which they call the rickets, wherein the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
goeth all to the upper parts, which are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
great and monstrous, and the lower parts pine
away: and so it is in the Clergy, some are so
poore that they cannot attend their ministerie,
but are faine to keepe Schooles, nay, Ale-houses,
some of them; and some others are so stately, they
will not attend their ministery: and so betweene
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96528:14"/>
them the flocke starves, but our evills have more
especially proceeded, from the excessive worldly
wealth, and dignities of one part of the Clergy, I
meane, such as either are in possession, or in hopes of
Bishoprickes for these great places of profit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
first have beene the baites of ambition, and
then they became the apples of contention, and last
of all the seeds of superstition, the one being a step
and degree unto the other, and all of them leading
in the end to the corruption, that I may not say sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of our Religion. Sir they are first the baits
of ambition, and I know not by what secret cause,
but experience sheweth us, that when Clergy men
have once tasted the sweete of wordly wealth and
honours, they are more eager, and ambitious after
them then any other sort of men, hereupon other
godly Ministers, that live more according to the
simplicity of the Gospel, and the example of <hi>Christ</hi>
aud his Apostles, cannot but beare witnesse against
their worldly pompe and dignities, and so the fires
of contention breaketh forth. And truely (Sir)
the state of the Clergy is very like to fire, which
whil'st it keepes in the chimney, it is of excellent
use to warme those that approach unto it, but if it
once breake out into the house, and get upon the
house top, it sets all on fire. So whilest the Clergy
keepe themselves within the pulpit, they are of
great use to stir up the zeale and devotion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but if they once flye out into the house, if
they begin to meddle with Civill places and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
and especially if they once get up to the
Counsell-table, it is seldome seene, but that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96528:14"/>
length they set all on fire, and what is it that maketh
the fire to breake out of the chimney, but too much
fuell: if there be but a moderate proportion of fuel,
the fire keepes it selfe within it's bounds, but if you
heape fagot upon fagot, a whole cart-load toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then it breaketh out: (so Sir) if there bee a
competent maintenance for the ministerie, they wil
keepe themselves within their bounds, but if living
bee heaped upon living, and temporalities added
to spiritualities, the flame will soone breake out,
and set the house on fire. (Sir) I doe not envy the
wealth or greatnes of the Clergy, but I am very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
if those were lesse, they would be better, and
doe more service to <hi>Christ</hi> and his Church, and I am
very cleare in mine owne heart, that the livings of
the Clergie being more equally distributed, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God would bee so farre from receiving any
prejudice, that it would bee much advanced, and
withall a good proportion of revenue might return
againe unto the Crowne, from whence it was first
derived. (Sir) Bishopricks, Deanaries, and Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
are like to great wasters in a wood, they make
no proofe themselves, they cumber the ground
whereon they stand, and with their great armes and
boughes stretched forth on every side, partly by
their shade, and partly by their sowre droppings
they hinder all the young wood under them
from growing and thriving. To speake plaine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
these Bishops, Deanes, and Chapiters, doe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
good themselves by preaching, or otherwise, and
if they were felled, a great deale of good timber
might be cut out of them, for the uses of the Church
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96528:15"/>
and Kingdome at this time. A fresh stoole of three
or foure able Ministers might spring up in their
stead, to very good purpose in those great townes,
which are ordinarily the seates of those Episcopal,
and Collegiate Churches, and the private congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of divers parochiall Churches might thrive
and grow better, which now have the Sun of Gods
word, I meane the cleare and spirituall preaching
thereof kept from them, and live in the dangerous
shade of ignorance, by reason that all the meanes
is taken from them, and appropriated unto Bishops,
or to Deanries, &amp; Chapters, and other such like Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate
Churches. Besides such as doe begin to grow
and start up through the voluntary pains of some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, or by such preaching as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have procured by their voluntary contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
should not still bee dropped on as they are,
from the armes and appendances of those great was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and kept downe continually by their bitter
persecutions. That which remaines now, is to shew
how these great revenues and dignities, become the
seeds of superstition, and that is thus. The Clergy
in the maintenance of their greatnesse, which they
are neither willing to forgoe, nor yet well able to
maintaine upon the principles of the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
finding that the popish principles, whereon
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> built his greatnesse, to suite well
unto their ends, that maketh them to side with that
party, and that must needs bring in superstition:
and as ambition allureth on the one side, so the
principles they goe by, draw them on farther, and
farther, and happily at length farther then they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96528:15"/>
themselvs at first intended. Whether a reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Rome, were imagined or no by some, I leave
it to every one to judge within himselfe: but sure I
am, if an accommodation could have been made in
some fashion or other, with the Church of Rome,
the Clergy might againe be capable of forraine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
and <hi>Cardinalls</hi> capps, and this is no small
temptation. Now Sir, I am at an end: onely I shall
draw out three conclusions, which I conceive may
clearely be collected out of what I have sayd: First
that civill jurisdiction in the persons of <hi>Clergy</hi> men,
together with their great revenues, and high places
of dignity, is one great cause of the evills which
wee suffer in matter of religion. Secondly, that the
sole and arbitrary power of Bishops in the ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and depriving of Ministers, and in excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
and absolution, is another great cause of
the evills we suffer in matter of Religion. Thirdly,
the strict urging of Subscription, and Conformity
to the Ceremonies, and Canons of the Church, is
another great cause of Evill, which we suffer in
matter of Religion.</p>
            <p>And now my humble motion is, that we should take
a piece only of this subject into our consideration,
but the whole matter, and that not only that part of
the Ministers remonstrance, which hath been read,
should be referred unto the Committee which you
are about to name, but <hi>Londons</hi> petition also, and
all other petitions of the like nature, so soone as
they shall be reade in the house, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
may collect out of them all, such heads as are
fit for the consideration of this house, and surely
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96528:16"/>
that is fit to be considered, that happily will not be
thought fit to be altered: consideration is one thing,
and alteration another: where there is a mixture
of bad and good together, the whole must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that wee may know how to sever the good from
the bad, and so retaine the one, and reject the other,
which is all that I desire. And if any thing have
fallen from me more inconsiderate (as in so long a
discourse many things may have done) I humbly
crave the pardon of the house, protesting that I have
spoken nothing but with a mind, which is ready
to sacrifice the body it dwelleth in, to the
peace and safety of his Majesties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and the safety and honour of
his Majestie in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them.</p>
