            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SEVERAL PROPOSALLS, Tendred to the conſideration of the Honorable <hi>Committee for Regulating of Courts of Juſtice,</hi> for a through Reformation thereof, and the generall ſatisfaction of all the <hi>Nation,</hi> ſave only ſome 20 or few more of the head <hi>Officers;</hi> who being taken away, and theſe <hi>Propoſalls</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will ſave the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> many hundred thouſand pounds in few yeeres.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>THAT the Grand and Head Officers of the ſeverall Courts of</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>as the</hi> Six-Clearks, Prothonotharies, <hi>and the like; having in the Reigne of the late Kings, and times of Monopolies and Patentees, obteyned divers</hi> Patents <hi>of ſeverall impertinent</hi> Offices <hi>and vaſt</hi> Fees, <hi>have and doe take the ſame, and force the</hi> People <hi>to pay them accordingly: By meanes whereof they have and doe raiſe great ſummes of money out of the</hi> Peoples <hi>Purſes and purchaſe great Eſtates therewith; And yet will not ſuffer the true Laborers, that diſcharge all the Offices, and take all the Paines to have ſo much as will reaſonably maintaine them, their Wives and Families.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. THAT all the head Officers and Maſters of Offices, may be required to bring in all their Fees and Demands, to the end it may appeare to the <hi>Committee</hi> what vaſt ſummes they raiſe for doing no manner of ſervice for the ſame, but meerely keep books of Receipts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of what they receive, and ſubſcribe their names to what they neither peruſe nor underſtand.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all Deputies, Under-clearks and other inferior Officers, that doe performe all the ſervice, and diſpatch all the Peoples buſineſſes, may be alſo required to bring in Particulars of what they receive for their Fees and Paines; and what they will be contented to take for diſpatching the buſineſſe of the Commonwealth in each Office: And alſo to bring in the names of ſuch Offices as are burthenſome and unneceſſarie; to the end the ſame may be taken away, and alſo to Propoſe a way for ſupplie thereof, leſſe burthenſome to the Commonwealth, with more ſpeedie diſpatch of Buſineſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this being done, all theſe head or chiefe Officers may be taken away, and ſome honeſt able Men choſen out of the ſeverall Offices, to make En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Regiſtries, to ſupplie their roomes, and to have a certain raſonable Stipend for the ſame; and the reſt of the inferior Officers and Clearks, that take all the paines, to have ſome reaſonable allowance for the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> one part out of three of the Fees now taken by the head Officers, or but halfe thereof at moſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That all the needeleſſe and chargeable Entries, tedious Proceedings (which the head Officers have contrived in the ſeverall Courts, for their own vaſt advantage) may be aboliſhed: And that the inferior Officers and Clearks, may bring in Particulars to the <hi>Committee</hi> for the due regulation thereof, and ſhortning of Proceedings, whereby Cauſes may be ſpeedier heard, at cheaper rates then formerly.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That all Fines paid to Curſitors, in <hi>England,</hi> upon any Original ſued forth, and all Fines paid upon levying of Fines and Recoveries, in <hi>Wales,</hi> and all Dammage-Cleere may be quite aboliſhed; being grievous Monopolies and Oppreſſions, which depended only on kingly Government, and ought now, to die with the Government.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That hereafter no Judges, Lord Keepers or Lords Commiſſioners, or Maſters of the Rolls, may receive any Fees under any notion whatſoever but only a Stipend ſutable to their Places and Truſts; it being a diſhonour for Perſons of their Degree to take Fees: And that they may not practiſe whileſt in Commiſſion for Judges, nor ſell any Places or Offices, as formerly they have done, for vaſt ſummes; and ſuffer the ſame to be executed by men that were never bred up in ſuch Places and Imployments.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the grievous oppreſſion of Goalers and Keepers of Priſons, and their under Officers may be eaſed, and that they may not rob both Creditor &amp; Debtor, as formerly; but may hereafter have certain Stipends and allowances ſuteable to their truſt and places, and that there may be fewer Priſons then are now uſed.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the like courſe may be taken with Sheriffs, Bayliffs, Ketchpoles, and others their Agents; by whoſe extortion and indirect practiſe the People are grievouſly oppreſſed and damnified.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That all areſts by thoſe vexatious Writts of <hi>Latitats,</hi> Bills of <hi>Middleſex, Quo Minus, Capias</hi> and the like, and that indirect proceedings to the <hi>Outlarie</hi> unknown to the Partie Outlawed may be aboliſhed: And that before any mans Perſon ſhall be areſted or reſtreyned he may have legall ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by way of Originall or other Writ, directed to the Sheriffe for that purpoſe, to be done perſonally, or elſe at his dwelling houſe with his Family, or other place of his uſuall and conſtant abode: And that there be fourteen dayes warning from the time of his perſonall ſummons and the day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at leaſt; and a moneth betweene the time of ſummons left at his houſe, &amp;c. and the day of his appearance; and if upon due returne made of ſuch Summons the Partie doe not appeare, either in Perſon, or by Attorney on Record, whereby the Plaintiffe may be enabled to proceede; the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe to bee at liberty, to proceede with Proceſſe againſt his perſon or goods; or elſe, by way of outlarie, to force his appearance, and obedience to the Law. But I refer my-ſelfe to Mr. <hi>Leach</hi> his Propoſalls; who if required to attend the <hi>Committee</hi> can inform them at large of theſe and many more abuſes.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That all Juſtices of Peace may have a certaine annuall ſtipend out of the publique Treaſury, for their ſervice; And neither they, nor their Clarkes, Servants, or Agents, to take any other fees, gratuities, or rewards, ſave only the uſuall allowed fees, taken by the Clarkes for their warrants, and for binding men, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That all mens eſtates may bee made lyable to pay their juſt debts; &amp; no fradulent intayles, or other feined eſtates in truſt, may avoid the reall Creditor. And that no man may bee impriſoned, that hath not wherewithall to ſatisfie his Creditor.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That (for avoyding the defrauding of Creditors, and divers ſuits and inconveniences, that come by intayles) theſe intayles may bee taken away; And that all mens eſtates may be reduced to a more certainty &amp; plainneſſe. And that (according to many true and former Propoſalls) there may be a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Regiſter, in every County, to Regiſter all Deeds, Contracts, Agreements, Bargaines, &amp;c. And Commiſſioners appointed to receive their acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which will avoyd many hundred ſuits, &amp; other inconveniences to the Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That for the avoyding of many litigious ſuits, for ſmall matters; which may be eaſily tryed at a cheaper rate, in the Towne Court, County Court, &amp;c. in the proper County where the Action lyes. Hereafter no action, or ſuit, may bee commenced in any of the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for any cauſe whatſoever, under twenty pounds in value, unleſſe the partie defendant live in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Middleſex;</hi> or doth reſide or remaine there at the time of the Action brought; whereby hee may receive due ſummons before arreſt, according to the former Propoſall.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That the Marſhalls Court, being a vexatious, troubleſome, chargeable, and unneceſſary Court, may be quite aboliſhed and taken away. And that ſo much of the Exchequer, and Chequer of Pleas as had relation, and dependance on Kingly Government; and ſhall bee now found inconvenient, or burthenſome to the Common-Wealth may bee alſo aboliſhed.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That the fees, and number of Lawyers may bee aſcertayned; and they not ſuffered to ſwarme, as they doe, before they have either experience or practiſe: The great ones now devouring the little ones; ſo that one cannot ſubſiſt by the other. And for the better regulation of the Law, and avoyding thoſe many grievous inconveniences, which dayly experience doth teach, by permitting Lawyers that are members of the Houſe, to have ſome of them, great Offices, which by their power they uphold; and others to practiſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and in the Circuits, when they ſhould attend their duty, in diſcharge of their truſt in Parliament. That hereafter no member of Parliament ſhall enjoy any Offices belonging to the Law; or practiſe in any Court, or Circuit, whileſt they continue members of Parliament: which if granted, will advantage the Common-Wealth many thouſand pounds in the yeare.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That the number of Attorneys may be aſcertained, together with their fees: and not to ſuffer every broken man, or litigious perſon to bee Attorney; that are neither of ability to doe the buſineſſe, or to anſwer for what they doe: it being often in the power of an Attorney to ruine many, if they bee ſo wickedly bent. And that no Malignant, or ill-affected Lawyers, or Attorneys, or other Officers, may bee ſuffered to practiſe or officiate.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That the ſame courſe may bee taken with Solicitors; and none to bee permitted to ſolicite; unleſſe hee bee approved by the Judges of the ſame Court and ſworne, as Attornies bee; and their names enrolled; and their fees, and number aſcertained. And that no Offices or Places what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, bee bought, or ſold, as hitherto hath beene practiſed, to the great prejudice of the Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>If theſe Propoſalls bee entertained with the ſame affection and zeale as they have beene penned, and the Author encouraged; hee intends to preſent divers more; which may prove very good, for information of the Committee: and if by them thought fit to bee granted, will prove, in all likelyhood, of vaſt uſe and benefit to the Common-Wealth.</p>
