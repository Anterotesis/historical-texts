            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Good Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not long ſince I accidentally met with a Printed Paper, Entitled, <hi>A Letter to a Member of Parliament, ſhewing that a Reſtraint on the Preſs is inconſiſtent with the Proteſtant Religion, and dangerous to the Liberties of the Nation.</hi> This Title at the firſt view did ſtartle and make me wonder; for I could not imagine how the Contents of this Letter could poſſibly juſtifie ſuch an Inſcription.</p>
            <p>But whether this Letter were really ſent, or only pretended, and by whom, I cannot tell; for the Writer of it thought it an act of Prudence to conceal his <hi>Name,</hi> as well as his <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But if he be not one of the worſt ſort of Hereticks, I mean a <hi>Socinian,</hi> it is his great misfortune, and no ſmall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108129:3"/>
fault, that he hath given his Reader juſt cauſe to think him ſo. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Author treats our Common People with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Civilities, he pleads for the full liberty of every Man's Conſcience; and tells us, that every Man hath as much right to Communicate his Thoughts to his Neighbour, as to think them himſelf; he tells us, that every Man is to judg for himſelf, even in the controverted Points of Religion, as well as the ableſt Divines of our Church. Nor can we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that a <hi>Socinian</hi> ſhould thus flatter the Vulgar; for they, who deſign to inſtil their <hi>Opinions</hi> into the <hi>Heads</hi> of Men, are concerned in Policy by fair words and courtſhip firſt to inſinuate <hi>themſelves</hi> into their <hi>Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This Author treats the Church of <hi>England</hi> with inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and ſcurrilous Language; he loads its Governours with ſeveral Calumnies, which are no way deſerved; he calleth them, <hi>Impoſers upon the Conſciences of Men, Tyrants, Lords of the Peoples Faith;</hi> but 'tis not my buſineſs to wipe off his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Reproaches, but to anſwer his groundleſs Arguments. But however, 'tis not ſtrange that a <hi>Socinian</hi> ſhould thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter the Clergy of our Church, to render us odious to the People, becauſe they know that our Divines are the moſt able Men to <hi>defend</hi> thoſe great <hi>Articles</hi> of our Creed, which they <hi>oppoſe;</hi> and to <hi>confute</hi> thoſe deteſtable <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which they <hi>promote,</hi> but will never be able to <hi>maintain,</hi> ſo long as the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhall continue as well ſtored with learned Men, as now it is. But in the mean time, they make it their buſineſs to diſparage and vilifie our Divines, in hopes that our People, diſeſteeming our <hi>Perſons,</hi> may ſhew the leſs regard to what we plead in defence of Truth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Author ſheweth himſelf yet more manifeſtly to be a <hi>Socinian,</hi> becauſe according to the known Practice of that ſort of Men, he highly magnifies <hi>Humane Reaſon,</hi> exalting it far above its proper <hi>Sphere,</hi> advancing it to that ſublime and ſacred Office, which, as now it is, it can never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For in that Preliminary Diſcourſe, which he premiſeth as an Introduction to the main Body and Subſtance of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he tells us, that God hath given Man,</hi> His Reaſon, which is his only light, not only to diſcover that there is a Religion, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108129:3"/>
to diſtinguiſh the True from the many falſe Ones. <hi>He tell us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> p. <hi>15.</hi> That God hath given Men no other Guide, but their Reaſon, to bring them to happineſs; <hi>and yet again,</hi> p <hi>17. he ſaith,</hi> That the Peoples common Notions are the Teſts and Standards of all Truths.</p>
            <p>Now, my own Reaſon, ſuch as it is, tells me, that all theſe Aſſertions are as falſe, as bold and daring; for, what greater Encomiums could have been given to Humane <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> were we ſtill in the ſtate of <hi>Innocence?</hi> though in that ſtate the Reaſon of Man might ſhine, like the <hi>Sun</hi> in its full glory, not a Cloud interpoſing; yet by, and ſince, the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Common Reaſon of Mankind is become like the <hi>Moon</hi> lying under, though not a Total, yet a very great Eclipſe. <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wiſeſt of Men, hath left our Reaſon no better Title than this; <hi>the Candle of the Lord.</hi> 'Tis not <note place="margin">Prov. xx. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

            <p>True it is, that this little light of Nature, being well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, is enough to diſcover to us ſome Truths, which are a ſufficient ground for <hi>natural</hi> Religion; the Reaſon of Man, exerciſing it ſelf in contemplating the Works of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Providence, is enough to convince him, that there is a God, and that this God ought to be worſhipped; but there are ſome other Truths, abſolutely neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which the moſt improved Reaſon of Man, without ſome other help, could never have diſcovered. In all Caſes, the Reaſon of Man is, <hi>lumen ſine quo non,</hi> a light, without which we can diſcern <hi>no</hi> Truth at all; but yet 'tis not a light, by which we can diſcern <hi>every</hi> Truth, which doth concern us. Our Lord hath truly ſaid; <hi>The light of the Body is the Eye,</hi> and <note place="margin">Matth. vi. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>yet this Eye, be it never ſo clear and ſtrong, without the help of ſome other Light beſide it's own, can ſee very little or nothing; ſo here, the light of the Soul is its Reaſon, and yet this Reaſon, without ſome other aſſiſtances, in matters of Religion can diſcern but very little.</p>
            <p>There were amongſt the Heathens many ſober, vertuous, and induſtrious Moraliſts, Men of raiſed Intellectuals, Men of excellent Parts both Natural and Acquired; and yet as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108129:4"/>

And as for the great Doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> Men of Reaſon look'd upon it, as <note place="margin">

            <p>But whence might this groſs Ignorance of theirs ariſe? How came it to paſs, that Men ſo acute and lucky in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and finding out many ſecret Myſteries both of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> ſhould be ſo dull and unhappy, as not to apprehend the Myſteries of <hi>Religion?</hi> Doubtleſs the Reaſon muſt needs be this; their own Underſtandings, though exerciſed to their utmoſt Ability, could not inform them better for want of ſome other and clearer Light. And what was their Caſe, would have been ours, had not God enlightened and bleſſed the Chriſtian Church with <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But withal, this great Bleſſing of Divine Revelation doth not <hi>exclude,</hi> but <hi>require</hi> the very utmoſt Exerciſe of human Reaſon; for we muſt employ, not only our Eyes or Tongues, but our Underſtandings in reading the Word of God; it muſt be our great Endeavour by the uſe of all proper means, to find out the true Meaning of what we read; and when upon good Grounds we are ſatisfied that the right Senſe of ſuch or ſuch a Text is this or that; though the Matter therein delivered be above the reach of our Reaſon, yet the ſame Reaſon will oblige us to believe it as an undoubted Truth, becauſe that God, who cannot lie, hath ſo revealed it. And this, I think, is all, which humane Reaſon hath to do in Matters of Faith and Worſhip, unleſs it be to oblige us to the Practice of what we know and believe.</p>

               <note place="margin">Joh. viii. 12.</note> To conclude this Subject, our Lord ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I am the light of the world,</hi> the ſame thing he ſaid to his Apoſtles too, <hi>ye are the light of the world,</hi> ſo they were not only by their <note place="margin">Matt. v. 14.</note>Holy <hi>Example,</hi> but by their Holy <hi>Doctrine</hi> too.

            <p>Now, if this be true, if Chriſt himſelf, if the Apoſtles of Chriſt, if the Goſpel of Chriſt be ſo many Lights differing in Number, had not this Author ſtrangely forgot himſelf and his Bible, when he told the World in his printed Paper, that the Reaſon of Man is the Light, nay, the <hi>only</hi> Light, which God hath given him to diſtinguiſh the true Religion from the falſe ones; and again, that God hath given to Men <hi>no</hi> other Guide, but their <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to bring them to Happineſs; and yet a third time, that the <hi>People's common Notions</hi> are the <hi>Teſts</hi> and <hi>Standards</hi> of all Truths. If theſe three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions be true, or any one of them, I do confeſs, that the ſmall Light of my own Reaſon hath not yet enabled me to diſcern any difference betwixt the cleareſt Truths, and the groſſeſt Errors. And verily the expoſing ſuch notorious Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoods to the view of the World by the help of the Preſs, is a very ſtrong Argument, why its Liberty ſhould be reſtrained.

By way of Conceſſion; we do eaſily grant that the Invention of Printing hath proved very beneficial to the Chriſtian Church: 'Tis this, which hath diffuſed the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of uſeful Arts and Sciences, and all ſorts of humane Learning: 'Tis this, which hath furniſhed our Libraries with vaſt Numbers of excellent Books: 'Tis this, which hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed our Churches and our Families with great Store of Bibles; and we eaſily grant, what this Author aſſerts, that to this Art of Printing we owe, under God, the happy and quick Progreſs of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>But 2. By way of denial, we cannot grant that the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Preſs is a good Argument, that its Liberty ſhould be unlimited. For notwithſtanding theſe great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which both <hi>Religon</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> have reaped from this curious Art of Printing, may not it, as well as many other things, very uſeful in their own Nature, be ſo abuſed and perverted, as to become Inſtrumental to the great <hi>Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of Mankind? 'Tis an old Rule, <hi>corruptio optimi peſſima;</hi> the better things are when well uſed, the worſe they grow, when corrupted. The Sword is an excellent Inſtrument, when it <hi>defends</hi> the guiltleſs, but it proves an unhappy Tool, when it <hi>murders</hi> the Innocent. Phyſick, duly adminiſtred by a Learned Phyſician, may <hi>preſerve</hi> a Life; but being miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied by an ignorant Mountebank, it tends to <hi>deſtroy</hi> it.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that the Art of Printing hath done a great deal of <hi>good,</hi> and we are to bleſs God for it; but withal, it is as certain, that it hath done, and ſtill may do a great deal of <hi>Miſchief,</hi> and we are to lament it. When the Preſs tends to promote <hi>Religion</hi> and Virtue, 'tis well employed, and ought to be <hi>encouraged;</hi> but when the Preſs tends to promote <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> it ought to be <hi>diſcountenanced</hi> and reſtrained. 'Tis evident that the Preſs hath been uſed to publiſh a great Numbers of ſuch Papers, as tend to <hi>debauch</hi> the <hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>corrupt</hi> the <hi>Judgments</hi> of Men; ſuch are our <hi>obſcene Poems,</hi> our <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>wanton Stage-plays,</hi> where Vice is not only <hi>repreſented</hi> but ſo <hi>promoted,</hi> that we may juſtly fear, that as <hi>all</hi> their Spectators loſe their <hi>Time;</hi> ſo <hi>many</hi> of them may loſe their <hi>Innocence</hi> too. For ſince the Hearts of Men are ſo prone to evil, and become ſo like to <hi>tinder,</hi> apt to take
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108129:5"/>
Fire from every little Spark, 'tis hard to <hi>ſee</hi> thoſe Vices, which are pleaſing to Fleſh and Blood, repreſented upon a publick Stage, and yet not be <hi>infected</hi> by them.</p>
            <p>And as theſe are very like to debauch their <hi>Spectator's Morals,</hi> ſo are there many other printed Papers as like to corrupt their <hi>Reader's Judgments.</hi> Such are thoſe many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes printed in Defence of <hi>Popery;</hi> and which is worſe, ſuch are thoſe Books printed in the Defence of <hi>Arianiſm, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm,</hi> and other <hi>Hereſies</hi> juſtly condemned by the Catholick Church in the firſt and pureſt Ages of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>'Tis reported that our modern <hi>Socinians</hi> have already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted a conſiderable Number of Men, not only by their <hi>perſonal Inſinuations,</hi> but by their <hi>printed Papers;</hi> and 'tis very probable, that they may yet make many more Proſelytes to their dangerous Opinion, if the Preſs be ſtill permitted to publiſh whatever they think fit to write. For their Books contain Arguments ſo plauſible, ſo ſeemingly ſtrong, that they may paſs for clear Evidences and Demonſtrations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the unlearned Multitude, who are in no capacity to diſcover the Fallacies that lie in them. Now, ſince the Preſs may as well do <hi>harm</hi> as <hi>good,</hi> 'tis very reaſonable that it ſhould be well regulated to <hi>promote</hi> that <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> that <hi>harm;</hi> 'tis very fit that no new Books ſhould be <hi>publiſhed,</hi> till they have been firſt <hi>ſuperviſed</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
            <p>But to whom ought the Care of this be committed? Doubtleſs to Men of <hi>Integrity, Learning</hi> and <hi>Judgment;</hi> to Men, who are able, at firſt view, to diſtinguiſh <hi>Vice</hi> from <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> from <hi>Error;</hi> and with ſuch Men is the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſtored; Men of ſuch Parts and Piety, that we cannot without breach of Charity, ſo much as once ſuſpect, that they would, to gratifie any Party, ſtifle any Book, which might tend to the <hi>advantage</hi> of the Chriſtian <hi>Church,</hi> or the common <hi>benefit</hi> of <hi>Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this, our Author thought fit to tell his Friend, the Parliament-Man, that of all other Perſons, the <hi>Clergy-men</hi> of our Church, are the moſt unfit to be truſted with the Regulation of the Preſs; and for that, he gives this Reaſon; namely, becauſe they would allow no Books to be publiſhed, ſave only ſuch as tend to eſtabliſh their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108129:6"/>
that is, in plain Engliſh, they would permit no Books to be printed, which tend to ſubvert the fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian Faith; and for that, Who can juſtly blame them?</p>
            <p>That the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are Sound and Orthodox, hath been proved over and over by ſuch Scripture Arguments, as Prieſts and Jeſuits, <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> or any other Heretick, never yet could, nor ever can overthrow; and if any Books, which contradict them, be offered to the Preſs, 'tis fit they ſhould be <hi>ſtifled</hi> in the <hi>Birth;</hi> and if they chance to be <hi>brought forth</hi> by ſtealth, 'tis fit they ſhould immediately be caſt into the <hi>Flames,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quickeſt way to <hi>cleanſe</hi> them from that <hi>Droſs</hi> that is in them.</p>
            <p>But however, to prevent as much as may be, the further increaſe of dangerous Books, which by good Words, fair Speeches, and ſeeming Arguments may do much Miſchief amongſt the illiterate Vulgar; 'tis very neceſſary, that all Writings offered to the Preſs about Matters of Religion, ſhould carefully be <hi>examined</hi> by Conſcientious and Judicious Divines; and that no general Liberty ſhould be allowed to Men of all <hi>Sects</hi> to <hi>write,</hi> and to <hi>Printers</hi> to <hi>publiſh</hi> whatever they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>There are amongſt us in this unhappy Age, Hereticks of <note place="margin">Tit. i. 11.</note>ſeveral denominations, of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Their mouths muſt be ſtopped;</hi> and for that he gives a very juſt Reaſon, when he tells us, <hi>They ſubvert whole houſes, teaching things which they ought not.</hi> Now, if there ought to be a Muzzle clapped upon the <hi>Hereticks mouth,</hi> there is far greater Reaſon that there ſhould be a reſtraint upon his <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Preſs.</hi> For 'tis impoſſible that any Heretick ſhould do ſo much Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief with his <hi>Tongue,</hi> as he may by his <hi>Writings;</hi> words only <hi>ſpoke</hi> and heard are <hi>tranſient;</hi> but words written and <hi>printed</hi> are <hi>permanent;</hi> an <hi>heretical Tongue</hi> can do no harm but by a <hi>perſonal Conference,</hi> but an <hi>heretical Pen</hi> may do much Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to Men at a <hi>diſtance;</hi> the wrong that may be done by <hi>heretical Diſcourſe</hi> alone, can reach but the <hi>preſent</hi> Age; but <hi>heretical Books</hi> may injure and poyſon the Souls of Men in <hi>after</hi> Ages. And ſince there are too many ſuch Books pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed amongſt us, it is the great Concern, and ſhould be the great Care of our Governours, to ſee that there be no
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108129:6"/>
more, leſt if their Number increaſe without controul, they may by degrees, conſidering the ignorance, inſtability, and credulity of Men, ſubvert the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God, and endanger the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi> But,</p>

            <head>SECT. III.</head>
            <p n="2">2. THIS Author argueth for an unlimited Liberty of the Preſs, not only for its own great <hi>Uſefulneſs,</hi> but from the Conſideration of ſeveral grand <hi>Inconveniences,</hi> which, as he ſaith, would follow, ſhould the Preſs chance to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained; and the firſt which he names, is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> The reſtraint of the Preſs tends to make Men blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit to the Religion they chance to be educated in, and to take it up without any trial. <hi>To this I anſwer thus;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Argument may hold in <hi>Popiſh</hi> Kingdoms, where the People for <hi>want</hi> of <hi>means,</hi> cannot; and, for <hi>fear</hi> of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors, <hi>dare</hi> not examine the Principles and Practices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. But the ſame Argument pleaded in, and againſt the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is of no Force; for it proceeds upon a falſe Ground, and hath a Fallacy in it; for here is, <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa;</hi> the reſtraint of the Preſs is here aſſigned as the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> or at leaſt the great <hi>Occaſion,</hi> that Men take up their Religion upon Truſt, though indeed it be not ſo.</p>
            <p>The matter of this Charge is true, and as it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, ſo it is much to be lamented, that great Numbers of Men, even amongſt us, do indeed take up their Religion barely on Truſt. Proteſtants they are, but why are they ſuch? only becauſe it was the <hi>Religion</hi> of their <hi>Parents,</hi> that wherein they were trained up from their Childhood; 'tis the Religion eſtabliſhed by our Laws, generally profeſſed in our Nation, and preached in our Churches. Theſe, I fear, are the only Motives, upon which the far greateſt Part of Men do, by a blind and implicite Faith, take up their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>There is a vaſt multitude of Men, who are conſtrained thus to take up their Religion upon truſt, by an <hi>invincible</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:108129:7"/>
               <hi>Neceſſity;</hi> Men, who were never bleſt with a liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, never taught to read; Men ſo dull and ſtupid, that they cannot <hi>apprehend,</hi> much leſs remember the Strength of an Argument; and ſurely Perſons under ſuch ill Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, are in no Capacity to <hi>judge</hi> for <hi>themſelves,</hi> but muſt <hi>rely</hi> upon the Judgment of their <hi>Teachers,</hi> and upon their Credit and Authority, take up ſome Religion or other, or elſe they can take up none at all; and this is the great unhappineſs of many Thouſands, I fear, even in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides theſe, there is another ſort of Men bred up in the Principles of Learning; Men of compleat Knowledge and good Ability to judge betwixt Vice and Vertue, Truth and Falſhood; and how frequently, how earneſtly, do we <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. v. 21. 1 Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> iv. 1.</note>exhort ſuch Men from our Pulpits, <hi>to prove all things, to try the Spirits;</hi> but, alas! 'tis much to be feared, that we loſe our Labour, that Men will not ſpare any time, nor take any pains to examin their Religion, but rather take it up at a venture juſt as they find it.</p>
            <p>Now, if a Man takes up his Religion upon truſt, when he <hi>need not</hi> do ſo, he runs himſelf both into <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>danger;</hi> a ſin it certainly is, becauſe a <hi>breach</hi> of thoſe fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>named <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;</hi> and a great danger it is, becauſe inſtead of a <hi>Juno,</hi> he may embrace a <hi>Cloud;</hi> inſtead of a <hi>true</hi> Religon, he may <hi>cloſe</hi> with a <hi>falſe</hi> one.</p>
            <p>But where lieth the Fault? Upon whom, or what, muſt this ſin be charged? Sure I am, that in this caſe a reſtraint upon the Preſs is innocent, and cannot be juſtly blamed; For, were not Men obliged to examin the Matters of their Religion long <hi>before</hi> the Art of <hi>Printing</hi> was invented? And was not the neglect of this Duty a ſin in former Ages, when there was not ſo much as one Preſs in all the World? And if ſo, How could the trial of Religions depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Preſs in thoſe early days, when as yet it had no being?</p>
            <p>And becauſe the true Chriſtian <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>ſame</hi> in all the Ages of the Church ſince the Apoſtles days, we muſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our <hi>own</hi> Religion by the ſame Rules, by which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Saints meaſured <hi>theirs,</hi> and what were they? Not the voluminous <hi>Writings</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> which the Preſs hath now
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108129:7"/>
brought forth, but the ſacred <hi>Oracles</hi> of God. This is the Courſe, to which the Prophet directs us; <hi>To the law, and to the Teſtimony.</hi> This Courſe did the <hi>Bereans</hi> take, when to examine the Doctrines even of the Apoſtles themſelves, <hi>They ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo;</hi> and for their doing ſo they are highly commended.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Scripture is the <hi>lapis Lydius,</hi> the <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> the Canon, the only Authentick Rule of <hi>Manners, Faith,</hi> and religious <hi>Worſhip;</hi> a Rule ſo <hi>plain</hi> and eaſie in all neceſſary points, that in order to the trial of our Religion we have no abſolute need of any Book but Gods, though other good Books do well towards the better underſtanding of ſome paſſages in this.</p>
            <p>'Tis the great Privilege of our Church that we have this Rule of Scripture in ſuch great Quantities, that every Man, who can and will, may, at an eaſie rate, have it in his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, and thereby examine his Religion, when he pleaſeth. Nor can we juſtly blame the reſtraint of the Preſs, ſo long as it is permitted to Print our <hi>Bibles,</hi> and prohibited to publiſh no <hi>Man's</hi> Book, but ſuch only, as are contrary to <hi>Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, were the Preſs in <hi>England</hi> reſtrained, as it is in <hi>Popiſh</hi> Kingdoms, from printing the Bible in our Vulgar Tongue, this Authors Argument would have had much ſtrength in it; but ſince it is otherwiſe; ſince we have the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> thoſe <hi>Teſts</hi> and <hi>Standards</hi> of our Religion, preached in our <hi>Publick Churches,</hi> and eaſily to be had and read, as oft as we pleaſe, in our <hi>private Families,</hi> this Author's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Reſtraint of the Preſs is invalid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluding; for it doth not prove that, for which he pleads it. But to proceed.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="4" type="section">
            <head>SECT. IV.</head>
            <p n="2">II. THE Second Allegation, which this Author urgeth, as a grand inconvenience, againſt the Reſtraint of the Preſs, is this; <hi>Such a Reſtraint,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>deprives Men of the moſt proper and beſt means to diſcover truth.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thus;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:108129:8"/>
There is a very cloſe Connexion betwixt this Argument and the former; a Connexion as between an Antecedent and a Conſequent; or between the Premiſes and the Concluſion. In the former Argument he mentions the examination of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions; and in this, as the end and conſequence of that, the diſcovery of Truth; for to what purpoſe ſhould any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be impartially examined, were it not to diſcover, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or falſe. And for this reaſon, the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which I have given to the former Argument, might ſerve well enough for this; for ſince the reſtraint of the Preſs doth not, as I have there proved, prevent the due <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> it cannot prevent the <hi>diſcovery</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that ſo it doth, our Author is very poſitive; yea, and he tells us by what means it doth ſo, namely, <hi>By hindering Men from ſeeing and examining the different Opinions, and the Arguments alledged for them.</hi> But let this Author tell us, how this can be true; can a Reſtraint of the Preſs for <hi>time to come</hi> hinder any Man from ſeeing and examining the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Opinions of Men, and their Arguments for them! Are there not already great numbers of printed Books, expoſed to common Sale, wherein the different Opinions of Men about matters of Religion are throughly diſcuſſed! May not every Man, that will and can, ſufficiently inform himſelf by Books already extant what Arguments have been pleaded by all Sects of Chriſtians in the defence of their reſpective Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions? And ſince the Preſs hath already brought forth ſuch a <hi>numerous iſſue</hi> of this kind, methinks every <hi>future</hi> birth of the ſame ſort would be but a <hi>Superfetation.</hi> I am perſuaded, that ſhould all the Preſſes in the Chriſtian world be abſolutely forbidden to print any more New Books of Controverſy, and Polemick Divinity, it would be no injury to the Catholick Church, nor to any one Member of it; for, <hi>nihil dici poteſt, quod non dictum eſt priùs; Prints</hi> indeed may be <hi>new,</hi> but <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi> either <hi>for</hi> old Truths, or <hi>againſt</hi> old Errors, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſo.</p>
            <p>But when all is done, Religious Truths cannot be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Humane Arguments any further than thoſe Arguments are grounded upon the <hi>infallible word</hi> of God. 'Tis a Rule in Mathematicks: <hi>Rectum eſt index ſui &amp; Obliqui.</hi> He, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108129:8"/>
would diſcover the <hi>Rectitude</hi> or <hi>Obliquity</hi> of a Line, muſt bring it to, and compare it with ſuch a Rule, as is already found to be exactly ſtreight. So in our preſent Caſe, he, who would diſcover the <hi>truth</hi> or falſhood of any Opinion in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, muſt apply them to, and judg them by that <hi>infallible Rule,</hi> which St. <hi>James</hi> very deſervedly Styles, <hi>The</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. i. 18.</note>
               <hi>word of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Rule, in all Points neceſſary to Salvation, is ſo <hi>plain</hi> and eaſie, that every Man, who hath not loſt the uſe of common Reaſon, may thereby judg for himſelf. There are indeed in the word of God, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Some things</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. iii. 1</note>
               <hi>hard to be underſtood;</hi> but in what Texts do theſe difficulties lie? St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwers, <hi>Non quoad ea, quae ſunt neceſſaria ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luti,</hi>

            <p>Now, if a Man may diſcover the truth of all thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which are neceſſary to Salvation, by Scripture Rules; if his Faith be grounded on them, and his Practice be ſuitable to them; what hazard would that Man run, ſhould he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee the different Opinions of Men about them, nor weigh their Arguments againſt them? Suppoſe a Man being well informed by the expreſs word of God, do ſtedfaſtly believe the Reſurrection of the dead; what were this Man the worſe, ſhould he never ſee nor examine the reaſonings of Pagans and Sadducees againſt this great Article of our Creed. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108129:9"/>
a Man be convinced, as well he may be, by ſuch Texts of Scripture, as cannot, with any tolerable Senſe, be otherwiſe interpeted, that our Bleſſed Saviour is truly God, and truly Man; What need ſuch a Perſon to ſee the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and weigh the Arguments of <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> againſt this fundamental Point of our Chriſtian Faith?</p>
            <p>To him, whoſe Belief is already grounded upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Word of God being rightly underſtood, the ſight of different Opinions, and the Arguments for them ſignifieth nothing; ſuch a Man doth not need the confutation of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Cavils to confirm that Faith of his, which is already bottomed upon a Rock, which is immoveable. And as the ſight of different Opinions, and the examination of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pleaded for them, is not <hi>needful</hi> to <hi>confirm</hi> a <hi>ſtrong</hi> and well grounded Faith; ſo it is <hi>dangerous,</hi> and tends to <hi>impair,</hi> and ſhake a <hi>weak</hi> one. For, well meaning Chriſtians, bred up in the true Religion, being of too eaſie Belief, of ſlender Judgments, and not well acquainted with the Word of God, may probably be perverted by heretical Books, as being unable to diſcern the Fallacies contained in them, and to cite ſuch Texts as might confute them.</p>
            <p>But here it may be demanded, Who muſt judge, whether ſuch or ſuch an Opinion be juſtified or condemned by ſuch or ſuch a Text? I anſwer, where Texts are plain and obvious, every diſcreet and intelligent Perſon may judge for himſelf; but when Texts are ſomewhat abſtruſe and difficult, when knotty Queſtions and Controverſies are raiſed about them, then the Judge muſt be no ſingle Perſon; no, nor any ſmall Party of Men, who are byaſſed, prejudiced, and wedded to their own Opinion, but the Judge muſt be the Catholick Church; I mean, its Repreſentative in the four firſt general Councils, which conſiſted of Men not over-aw'd by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor tempted by Intereſt; but Men as Religious, as they were Learned, as well Verſed in Holy Writ, as able Interpreters of Scripture, as any ſort of Men, born ſince thoſe early days.

Now, Since we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are bleſt with the free uſe of our Bibles; and favoured with the judgment of the beſt Expoſitors about the ſenſe of thoſe Texts, which tend moſt to determine thoſe Diſputes, which have aroſe betwixt Proteſtants and Papiſts, betwixt Trinitarians and Anti-Trinitarians, we can have no need, of any ſearch for Truth, to conſult the printed Papers of this Age, many of which do tend to <hi>promote Error</hi> much rather than <hi>diſcover Truth.</hi> And verily when the Licenſer of Books doth reject and ſuppreſs Heretical Papers, he doth good ſervice both to God and Men; and if ſuch Papers chance to <hi>Steal</hi> the Preſs, they ought to be treated like <hi>other Thieves,</hi> who, to prevent their doing any future miſchiefs, are <hi>Apprehended, Condemned,</hi> and <hi>Executed.</hi> And ſo I quit this Argument, and proceed to the next.</p>

               <hi>3. THIS Authors third Allegation againſt the reſtraint of the Preſs runs thus,</hi> The Reſtraint of the Preſs hinders Truth from having any great influence on the minds of Men, which is owing chiefly to examination; becauſe that which doth not convince the Underſtanding, will have but little, or no effect upon the Will. <hi>I anſwer thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What this Author doth here aſſert in relation to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Underſtanding upon the Will and Affections is true in general; nor can it be juſtly denied that a ſtrict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Religion is the proper means to convince the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of its Truth.</p>
            <p>But although the ſubject matter of this Allegation be true in the general; yet here it is miſapplied and very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Caſe now in hand. For this Argument, as the former did, doth proceed upon a falſe Hypotheſis; for it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that if the Preſs ſhould chance to be reſtrained for time to come, Men would be deprived of all ſufficient means for the due examination of their Religion.</p>
            <p>'Tis St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Command, <hi>Prove all things.</hi> 'Tis St. <hi>John</hi>'s Command, <hi>Try the Spirits, whether they are of God.</hi> Theſe Commands muſt needs ſuppoſe, that in thoſe days there was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108129:10"/>
a certain Rule, by which Religions might be tried<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſame Rule, in its full force and vertue, is ſtanding ſtill. Tell me then, are our <hi>Bibles</hi> out of Print, or taken from us? Have we no <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> no <hi>Syſtems</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> left amongſt us? Nay, are there not <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Controverſies</hi> expoſed to Sale in our Cities, greater Towns, and both our Univerſities? Nay more, are there not <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Socinian Catechiſms</hi> to be had in <hi>England?</hi> Do not theſe Books already Extant, contain the ſtrongeſt Arguments, which the moſt learned Men of all Parties were able to urge in favour of their reſpective Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? And may not Men by weighing theſe Reaſons, which are already made publick, give a judgment which Religion is <hi>true,</hi> and which is <hi>falſe,</hi> as well as by any <hi>new</hi> Papers yet to be printed?</p>
            <p>But although there be a great variety of Books, which may help to guide us in our ſearching after Truth; yet I muſt ſtill mind my Reader that the Scripture is the only <hi>Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate</hi> and <hi>Authentick</hi> Rule, whereby the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>falſhood</hi> of any Religion muſt be determined. And certain it is, that thoſe <hi>Convictions</hi> of Man's <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> which ariſe from the <hi>Immediate</hi> word of God, are like to have a more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>influence</hi> upon the <hi>Will</hi> and Affections, than any other Convictions ariſing from any ſuch <hi>Arguments,</hi> as are no more than the Dictates and Collections of <hi>humane Reaſon,</hi> which is fallible, and may deceive us, whereas the word of God, well underſtood, cannot do ſo. And this, I think, is a ſufficient anſwer to this Authors third Allegation.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I cannot paſs by this without obſerving that this Author hath hitherto much harped upon the ſame thing, and hath hitherto bottomed all his Arguments upon the ſame Ground, and a very ſlippery one too; he hath propoſed his Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108129:10"/>
as <hi>diſtinct</hi> in their <hi>Number,</hi> but in their <hi>Proof,</hi> there is little or <hi>no difference</hi> to be found.</p>
            <p>For he tells; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Reſtraint of the Preſs tends to make Men blindly ſubmit to the Religion they chance to be educated in. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it deprives Men of the moſt proper and beſt means to diſcover Truth. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it hinders Truth from having any great influence upon the minds of Men. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That it tends to make Men hold the Truth, if they chance to light on any, guiltily.</p>
            <p>Theſe indeed are very conſiderable Objections againſt the Reſtraint of the Preſs, were they true; But how doth our Author prove them ſo to be? To prove them all, he hath yet made uſe but of one <hi>medium,</hi> and that a falſe one too; for 'tis nothing elſe but a groundleſs ſuppoſition that Men would want due means for the examination of their Religion, were the Preſs any whit reſtrained. I ſay, any whit; for we do not plead for a total Reſtraint, but for a juſt and due Regulation. And were the Preſs ſo regulated, yet would it not be attended with any of theſe ill Conſequences, with which this Author is pleaſed to charge it; for ſince Men have ſufficient means for the trial of their Religion, if they do it not, their fin and folly muſt be imputed, not to the <hi>Reſtraint</hi> of the Preſs, but to their own <hi>Ignorance</hi> or Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; for, as ſome cannot, ſo others will not.

            <p>But then methinks, before we do this, we ſhould, not only <hi>think,</hi> as this Author ſaith, but <hi>ſecure</hi> our ſelves and others too, that the Religion which we advance in the World, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Religion of God; we muſt be ſure that we plant not <hi>Weeds</hi> inſtead of <hi>Flowers,</hi> that we ſow not <hi>Tares</hi> inſtead of <hi>Wheat.</hi> For to promote a Religion, which may poſſibly be falſe, were a deſperate Venture indeed, and he that doth it, hazards the Honour of God, and the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>I find that our bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles taught no Doctrine, but what they were ſure of; <hi>We ſpeak that we</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. iii. 11. 1 Joh. iii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note>
               <hi>know,</hi> ſaith our Lord; and thus St. <hi>John, We know that we are of the Truth.</hi> Certainly, whoſoever undertakes, and is obliged to inſtruct another in matters of Religion, had need be very well informed himſelf.</p>
            <p>For if our Directions ſhould chance to prove wrong, What Excuſe could we make? Suppoſe we inſtil into the minds of Men <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> inſtead of <hi>Truth,</hi> What were this but to <hi>ruin</hi> the Souls of Men, though we might think to <hi>ſave</hi> them? It's true, our good Intention and Ignorance may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe ſuch an ill Act, <hi>à tanto,</hi> but though ſuch a miſtake may ſomewhat extenuate the Fault, yet can it no way leſſen the fatal Conſequence that doth attend it. Suppoſe a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who really intends to <hi>cure</hi> his Patient, by a miſtake of his Remedy, ſhould chance to <hi>kill</hi> him, the poor Patient, who dieth only by a miſtake, ſuffers as great an injury, as if his Phyſician had poyſoned him knowingly, and with deſign. 'Tis indeed an Act of Charity to inſtruct the Ignorant, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108129:11"/>
               <hi>lead</hi> the <hi>Blind;</hi> but withal, the Man who undertakes it, muſt have <hi>Eyes</hi> in his own Head, leſt if the <hi>blind lead the blind,</hi> they both fall into, and periſh in the Ditch. Certain it is, we are much engaged very ſtrictly to ſift the Grounds of that Religion, which we are to propagate in the World, and teach our Neighbours, leſt otherwiſe, through our <hi>own miſtake,</hi> and <hi>his confidence,</hi> we become guilty of <hi>cruel Charity,</hi> and prove inſtrumental to <hi>damn</hi> that Perſon whom we ſhould endeavour, as far as we can, to <hi>ſave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it is a dangerous thing for private Perſons to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote any falſe Religion, though they themſelves being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, do think it true; ſo to permit other Men to publiſh heretical Doctrins cannot be the Duty of thoſe Perſons, who have Authority, and ſhould have Zeal, to prevent it. To reſtrain this unchriſtian Liberty of the Tongue, Pen, and Preſs, is not, as this Author doth boldly aſſert, <hi>To invade the natural Rights of mankind, nor to deſtroy the common Tyes of humanity.</hi> For if it be a Man's natural Right to perſuade his Neighbour, either by his <hi>Tongue</hi> or his <hi>Pen,</hi> to entertain an Opinion really heretical, whether he thinks it ſo or not; 'tis alſo his natural Right to <hi>draw</hi> him into <hi>Sin;</hi> for if he prevail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that will be <hi>finis operis,</hi> though not <hi>operantis;</hi> it will be the <hi>iſſue</hi> of the <hi>Act,</hi> though it were not the <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>Agent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot doubt but that St. <hi>Paul</hi> very well underſtood what natural Right every Man hath to uſe his Tongue, and in what caſes he ought to do it, and thereby to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Thoughts to his Neighbours; but ſuppoſe a Man's Thoughts be wild, and his Opinions heretical, muſt he be left at Liberty to impart ſuch Thoughts, and vent ſuch Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, even as he pleaſeth? See what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Hereticks, <hi>Their mouths muſt be ſtopped; i. e.</hi> they muſt <note place="margin">Tit. i. 11.</note>not be permitted by perſonal Conferences to communicate their ill Opinions to <hi>inform,</hi> or, which is all one, to <hi>corrupt</hi> the Judgments of other Men; ſo thought St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Now, he who pleads for an univerſal Liberty, as the natural Right of all Mankind, to communicate to other Men, whatever they <hi>think</hi> to be a Truth, whether it be ſo or not; muſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure St. <hi>Paul</hi> as a Man, either ignorant, or elſe an invader
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108129:12"/>
of Men's natural Right, ſince he ſo poſitively declares that ſome Men's Mouths muſt be ſtopped.</p>
            <p>And in order to this, the ſame Apoſtle gave Biſhop <hi>Titus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tit. iii. 10.</note>this Direction, <hi>A man that is an heretick, after the firſt and ſecond admonition, reject; i. e.</hi> excommunicate him, caſt him out of the Church; and certainly, if the <hi>Perſon</hi> of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Heretick muſt be rejected, his <hi>Books</hi> may not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; <note place="margin">2 Tim. ii. 17.</note>for, as to his Perſon, his <hi>Breath</hi> is infectious. <hi>His words eat like a Canker;</hi> and as to his <hi>Writings,</hi> there is in his Ink more <hi>Poyſons</hi> than one.</p>
            <p>Now, ſince there are ſo many heretical Pens at work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, there is great need now, if ever, that ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Argus</hi> ſhould attend and watch the Preſs, leſt more venemous Doctrins ſhould ſteal from thence to infect and kill the Souls of Men.

               <hi>6. THis Author's ſixth Allegation againſt the Reſtraint of the Preſs is this;</hi> There is no medium between Men's judging for themſelves, and giving up their Judgments to others. <hi>We grant it, but what then? His Inference is this,</hi> If the firſt be their Duty, the Preſs ought not to be reſtrained; <hi>But why not? His Reaſon is again the ſame,</hi> becauſe it debars Men from ſeeing thoſe Allegations, by which they are to inform their Judgments: <hi>That's his Argument, to which I anſwer thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt Man and Man, betwixt ſuch as can judge for themſelves, and ſuch as cannot, where the Scripture is expreſs, the Words plain, and the Senſe eaſie; every Man who hath a competent uſe of Reaſon, and can read his Bible, may judge for himſelf. But when ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations are given of any Texts, when Doubts are raiſed, when Arguments are produced to defend both Parts of a Contradiction; there is a vaſt number of Men, who are no more able to judge which is <hi>true,</hi> and which is <hi>falſe,</hi> than a <hi>blind</hi> Man is to diſtinguiſh betwixt a <hi>good</hi> Colour and a <hi>bad</hi> one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:108129:12"/>
'Tis the great unhappineſs of ſuch Perſons, that in matters of Controverſy they cannot rely upon their own weak Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but muſt either ſuſpend their Judgments, or elſe give it up to the Conduct of ſome other Perſon, and who is ſo fit to be truſted with it, as their own Miniſters? provided they be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as every Miniſter ſhould be, Men of Piety and Parts, able to ſatisfie Doubts, remove Scruples, and convince Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers.</p>
            <p>But if Men give up their Reaſon to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> this Author, who vilifieth our Clergy as much as poſſible he can, gives our People an intimation, that by ſo doing, they make us, <hi>the Lords of their Faith;</hi> But how doth that follow? ſuppoſe two Perſons are engaged in a doubtful Controverſie about an Eſtate claimed by both, theſe Perſons being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unable to determine the Caſe, appeal to the King's Judges, but do they thereby make thoſe Judges the Lords of that Eſtate which is contended for? ſurely no, the Judge doth no more than according to Evidence and Law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to which Perſon that Eſtate doth juſtly belong.</p>
            <p>So it is in our preſent Caſe, ſeveral Parties of Men lay Claim to Truth as theirs, and produce Evidences for it: Now, a Man unable to ſatisfie himſelf which ſide Truth is to be found, conſults his Miniſter, who, by Evidence of Scripture, which in this caſe is the only Law, aſſures his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the Truth lieth here or there.</p>
            <p>And indeed that the Miniſter is the moſt proper Judge in Controverſies relating to Religion, we cannot doubt, if we dare believe the <hi>Prophet,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>The Prieſt's lips ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mal. ii. 7.</note>
               <hi>knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth, for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> This Text doth not conſtitute us, nor do we pretend to be Lords of our People's Faith; but as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Helpers to the Truth.</hi> We do not require any weak Believer's aſſent to any one Article of Faith, whereunto God requires it not, though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſo: And how unjuſtly then, without Modeſty or Truth, doth this Man ſtigmatize us, as <hi>Lords of our People's Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſide thoſe weak Chriſtians, who in controverted Points cannot judge for themſelves, there are ſome other of clearer Heads, and more improved Underſtandings that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108129:13"/>
can; and for their ſakes this Author ſaith, that the Preſs ought not to be reſtrained, and his Reaſon is this; <hi>Becauſe the Reſtraint of the Preſs debars them from ſeeing thoſe Allegations by which they are to confirm their Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Argument, in effect, hath already been offered once and again, and hath as often been replied to; but for the greater ſatisfaction of my Reader, I ſhall again conſider and enlarge my Anſwer to it, and this it is: Not knowing and intelligent Chriſtian, who is well able to judge for himſelf, can want any new Allegations from the Preſs to confirm his Judgments in any diſputed Points of Faith or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, becauſe we have already ſufficient Rules to judge by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For,</p>

            <p>The grand Controverſie, now on foot amongſt us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Perſonality</hi> and <hi>Deity</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that Chriſt, in the moſt ſtrict and proper Senſe of that Notion, is <hi>truly</hi> God; that the Holy Ghoſt is a <hi>Perſon,</hi> and a <hi>Divine Perſon,</hi> we affirm; but our <hi>Socinians,</hi> who are the <hi>ſpawn</hi> of old <hi>Arius,</hi> make bold to deny.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe Councils conſiſting of ſome Hundreds of Biſhops, having the Glory of God in their Hearts, the Settlement of the Church in their Eyes, and the Bible in their Hands, did after a mature deliberation, pronounce the Opinions of theſe Men to be contrary to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the obſtinate defenders of them to be <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And certainly the determinations of theſe General Councils, which were made up of Perſons <hi>exemplary</hi> for their <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>eminent</hi> for their <hi>Learning,</hi> who reſolved on nothing without mature Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Deliberation, are of as great Authority, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford as much Satisfaction in Matters of Religion, as any thing of <hi>Man</hi> can <hi>be</hi> or <hi>do.</hi> For the Truths of God, once taught the World by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, being unchangeable for ever; and our Bibles, which are the only Rule to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Religions by, continuing one and the ſame for ever; that, which was an Error in thoſe early days, muſt needs be an Error ſtill; and that, which was a Truth then, muſt needs be a Truth now. And if we cannot think of any more proper means for the right underſtanding of Scripture, and the diſcovery of Truth and Error, than the deliberate and unanimous Judgment of ſo many hundred pious, learned, and unbiaſſed Men aſſembled together; then certainly the determinations of thoſe antient Councils are very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Evidences <hi>for Truth,</hi> and <hi>againſt Error.</hi> And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe they conſiſted of ſuch Perſons, who, beſides their eminent Piety and Learning, had the great Advantage of living nearer the Apoſtles age, and thereby were the better able to inform themſelves and us, what was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly believed and done in the very infancy of the Chriſtian Church.</p>

            <p>That <hi>Ignatius, Clemens, Origen, Athanaſius, Cyril, Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene, Baſil, Chryſoſtom, Hierom, Auſtin,</hi> and many others both in the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, were indeed Perſons of great Piety and excellent Parts, our <hi>Socinians,</hi> without breach of Modeſty, cannot deny.

            <p>True it is, if we take theſe Fathers ſingly, Man by Man, where we find any of them <hi>alone</hi> in their Opinions, as <hi>Origen</hi> in reference to the <hi>Puniſhments</hi> of Hell; and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in reference to <hi>Infants</hi> that die unbaptiſed; we are not in this caſe much more obliged to accept their Judgment, than the Judgment of ſome ſingle Perſon yet alive.

            <p>In ſhort, the ſubſtance of my Anſwer to this Argument is this; ſince we have the written Word of God to be our Rule, and ſince this Word, in ſome material Caſes, according to the different <hi>Fancies</hi> and <hi>Intereſts</hi> of Men, hath different Interpretations given concerning its true Senſe and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 'tis our ſafeſt way, for our better Satisfaction, to betake our ſelves to the moſt able, faithful and unbiaſſed Judges; and they are the moſt <hi>antient Councils,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> whoſe Judgments are declared in our ſeveral Creeds, in other publick Confeſſions of Faith, and Orthodox Catechiſms ſet forth or approved by the Church of God.</p>
            <p>And ſince we are very well ſtored with theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Helps, I do once more conclude that no Man, whether learned or unlearned, can need any <hi>new</hi> Arguments from the Preſs to confirm his Judgment in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

            <p>And I think that it will be no breach of Charity, if I tell my Reader that I am verily perſuaded, that the great Reaſon, why this Author pleads ſo many Arguments, though no good ones, for the unlimited liberty of the Preſs, is this; namely, that our <hi>Socinians</hi> may without controul publiſh their Books full of <hi>ſubtile,</hi> but <hi>fallacious</hi> Arguments to Surprize and Captivate the Judgments of illiterate and undiſcerning Men.

               <hi>9. THE Ninth Allegation, which this Author urgeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Reſtraint of the Preſs, is this;</hi> Our Divines condemn the Popiſh Clergy for not ſuffering their Laity to read Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Authors; <hi>We do ſo, and very juſtly too, but what then? The Inference, which he intends, muſt be this;</hi> Our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Clergy muſt be Condemned for not ſuffering our Laity to Read Socinian Books, and for watching the Preſs to prevent it.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer thus; this Inference is, a <hi>Non Sequitur,</hi> it is wild and extravagant; for there is a great difference in the Caſe: the prohibition of Books may be an Act either to be <hi>blamed</hi> or <hi>commended</hi> according as the Books prohibited are either <hi>really good</hi> or <hi>really bad;</hi> to forbid Men the uſe of ſuch Books, as tend to the <hi>benefit</hi> of Mankind, the advantage of True Religion, and the Salvation of Souls, is an Act <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious</hi> and Tyrannical. And this is the known Practice of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which forbids <hi>Lay-men</hi> to Read the <hi>Bible,</hi> and the Writings of ſuch <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Authors as teach nothing but what the Scriptures teach, and for this do we very juſtly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them.</p>
            <p>But on the other Hand, to forbid injudicious Men the uſe of ſuch Books, as tend to promote <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract their Readers Judgment, and rather to <hi>ſhake</hi> their Faith than to <hi>confirm</hi> it, is an Act <hi>laudable,</hi> Charitable, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Age we live in, for thoſe Predictions of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; <hi>falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe;</hi> and again, <hi>falſe</hi>

That we may ſee how little ſervice this Paſſage doth our Author, let us view it again. <hi>They who have a good Cauſe,</hi> but who are they? We cannot doubt, but this good Man meant the <hi>Church of England,</hi> of which he himſelf was a very worthy Miniſter; but what ſaith he of this Church of Ours? <hi>It will not fright Men from conſidering,</hi> &amp;c. but what Men? This eminent Divine was the <hi>Lecturer</hi> of <hi>Gray</hi>'s <hi>Inn,</hi> where his <hi>Auditory</hi> did chiefly conſiſt of ſuch Perſons, as had been bleſt with a <hi>learned Education,</hi> and might Charitably be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be well skilled in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as well as in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that this judicious Divine of ours did mean, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> would rather encourage than forbid Perſons ſo qualified to read and Examine the Books of our Adverſaries as well as our own; to me ſeems evident from that reaſon which he ſubjoyns as the only end of an impartial Examination, namely this, <hi>That they may ſee the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Truth and Error, Reaſon and Sophiſtry, with their own Eyes;</hi> This Expreſſion doth plainly import the Perſons fit to Read Books of <hi>Controverſie</hi> in matters of Religion are only ſuch as have <hi>Eyes of their own, i. e.</hi> clear Heads, enlightned Underſtandings, able to diſcern Truth from Falſhood.</p>
            <p>And verily could the Books of our <hi>Socinians</hi> be confined within the <hi>Libraries</hi> of <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>judicious Men,</hi> whether of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> or of the <hi>Laity:</hi> could they be ſurely kept from <hi>purblind Eyes</hi> and <hi>weak Judgments;</hi> that unlimited liberty of the Preſs, which this Author doth ſo earneſtly contend for, were the more allowable.

            </p>
            <p>Here are two Suppoſitions, both which are either imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to us, or falſe in themſelves; if the Church of <hi>England</hi> be not the Perſons here charged, the Charge is impertinent; but if they be, it is falſe. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Church of <hi>England</hi> doth tie none of her Members to that Interpretation of Scripture, which ſuch or ſuch a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſer of hers ſhall approve.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known that we have many Interpretations of the Scripture, which never were under the Inſpection of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Licenſer; the Expoſitions of the Fathers, Schoolmen, and many other Divines are brought us from beyond the Seas, and the free choice and uſe of them is allowed us by our Church. And if ſuch Books chance to be Reprinted here in <hi>England,</hi> the care of the Edition is committed, not to the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſer</hi> of Books to judg of their <hi>matters,</hi> but to the <hi>Compoſer</hi> and <hi>Corrector</hi> of the Preſs to ſee to their <hi>Forms,</hi> Character, and exact truth of Printing.</p>
            <p>Now, if this be ſo, as indeed it is; if we are allowed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult various Interpreters of our Bibles, if we may take our Choice of ſuch or ſuch Expoſitors, and uſe what Editions we pleaſe; why ſhould this undeſerved imputation be caſt upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as if ſhe tied all her Sons to ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the Holy Scripture, as her own Licenſers ſhall Authoriſe?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:108129:18"/>
2. The Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not give her Licenſers a <hi>Deſpotick, Arbitrary,</hi> and <hi>Abſolute</hi> Power to reject every Book, every Interpretation of Scripture, which doth not pleaſe them.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that our Licenſers do not act by any immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and <hi>independent</hi> Power of their <hi>own;</hi> but as <hi>Delegates</hi> and Subſtitutes by an Authority derived from their Superiors, and if any of them ſhall either <hi>allow</hi> any Book, which tends to <hi>miſchief;</hi> or <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> any Book, which tends to <hi>common good,</hi> they do abuſe their Power, exceed their Commiſſion, and muſt anſwer for it.</p>
            <p>But is the miſcarriage of ſome few Licenſers an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they ſhould all be laid aſide? Some Kings have proved cruel Tyrants. Some Judges have been corrupted, and muſt we therefore have neither King nor Judg? Sure I am that in this Age of ours we do ſufficiently need a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and able Judg of Books: and the Teſt and Cenſure of ſuch a Judg no Man need fear more than our <hi>Socinian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> for they, being no great <hi>Friends</hi> to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> are very odd <hi>Interpreters</hi> of it, not through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> but <hi>deſign;</hi> I will not ſay, through <hi>Rancor</hi> and Malice; but I will ſay, through <hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>Prejudice.</hi> For, becauſe the beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and ſeveral Expreſſions in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> being rightly underſtood, and in the ſenſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, do totally overthrow their dangerous Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis; they fix upon thoſe Texts ſuch Interpretations as are <hi>childiſh, abſurd,</hi> and even <hi>ridiculous;</hi> ſuch, as none of the <hi>Fathers, Schoolmen;</hi> or <hi>Criticks,</hi> ſo far as I can find, did even think of. And what an ill Cauſe do theſe Men manage, who endeavour with handfuls of <hi>dirt</hi> to <hi>ſtop</hi> the <hi>Mouths</hi> of thoſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> who, being permitted to ſpeak their own ſenſe, do ſo loudly proclaim their united Teſtimonies againſt them?</p>
            <p>And methinks this one Conſideration, were there no more, is enough to juſtifie our Church in appointing ſome fit Perſons to be the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>Books,</hi> and the <hi>Interpretations</hi> of Scripture offered to the Preſs; and the rather, becauſe if any Licenſer ſhould out of any by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>reſpect, or for any ſiniſter end, <hi>Stifle</hi> any Papers, which <hi>deſerve</hi> to ſee the light; the injured Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors may appeal from the <hi>Licenſer</hi> to the <hi>Vice-Chancellors</hi> in

either of our Univerſities, or to the <hi>Lord Biſhop of</hi> London, or to his <hi>Grace the Lord Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury; ſo that the fate of Books doth not ultimately depend upon the pleaſure or ſole Judgment of a Licenſer.</p>
            <p>Now, Thoſe two forenamed Suppoſitions, upon which this Author bottoms this Tenth Allegation, proving falſe, the Superſtructure, which he builds upon them, falls to the Ground, and there I leave it.</p>

            <p n="11">11. THE next Allegation againſt the Reſtraint of the Preſs this Author thruſts into the Mouths of other Men, and makes them ſay what perhaps he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth not think: namely this. <hi>'Tis no ſmall preſumption that the Clergy themſelves are Conſcious of the falſeneſs of their Religion.</hi> How! the <hi>Clergy,</hi> what! the <hi>whole</hi> Clergy? Are <hi>ten thouſand</hi> of us at once preſumed to be <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> Juglers, and groſs Diſſemblers with God and Man? We, who teach Men that a falſe Religion leads towards Hell, do we know our own to be falſe, and yet embrace it ſtill? The Martyrs of <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days died for the <hi>ſame Religion,</hi> which we now profeſs, and were they alſo Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that this Religion is falſe, and yet in the <hi>defence</hi> of it ſhed their blood?</p>
            <p>Certainly this Preſumption is <hi>not ſmall,</hi> but very ſtrange; 'tis a great breach as well of <hi>Charity</hi> as of <hi>Truth;</hi> for, if the Scriptures be true, and who dares ſuſpect them? We are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly convinced that our Religion cannot be falſe; and why then ſhould any Man preſume that we have indeed other thoughts concerning it? The Reaſon here given is this; <hi>Becauſe the Clergy dare not ſuffer their Religion to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a fair Trial,</hi> but do what they can to <hi>Stifle</hi> all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that can be urged againſt it. But, Sir, Pray tell us, can any <hi>ſound</hi> Reaſon be ever urged againſt a Religion, ſuch as ours is, Inſtituted by Chriſt, Taught by his Apoſtles, Embraced by the Primitive Church, and Sealed by the Blood of thouſands of Martyrs.</p>

But 'tis not ſtrange to hear Men ſpeak againſt the very beſt of <hi>things</hi> or <hi>Perſons;</hi> for our Lord told his Apoſtles, <note place="margin">Matth v. 11.</note>
               <hi>Men ſhall revile you, and ſay all manner of evil againſt you.</hi> Thus were their <hi>Perſons</hi> treated; yea, and their <hi>Doctrine too.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. xiii 45<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſ. cxxxix. 20.</note>
               <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>ſpake againſt thoſe things, which were ſpoken by</hi> Paul. Nay, the Pſalmiſt tells his God, <hi>They ſpeak againſt thee;</hi> and what wonder then if they ſpeak againſt his <hi>Religion</hi> too? But what do they ſpeak? That, which this Author ſtyles <hi>Reaſon,</hi> is but <hi>Pretence</hi> and Sophiſtry; and were ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, though never ſo <hi>plauſible,</hi> yet being <hi>fallacious,</hi> buried in perpetual Oblivion, and ſtifled for ever, what harm were in it? What one ſingle Soul would be the worſe?</p>
            <p>But our Author replieth, that when there is a Conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men of two different Opinions, they have not fair Play, if their reſpective Reaſons be not heard equally on both ſides; we grant it, what <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Well, the main Parties, now contending, are the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and our <hi>Socinians,</hi> and have not theſe Men very often been heard already? their Opinion, and their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it, being much the ſame with thoſe of the Old <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> have been frequently debated, all their Witneſſes have been heard, all their Evidences have been maturely Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Baffled, and Overthrown, and Condemned by ſeveral <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> by many pious and learned <hi>Fathers,</hi> by a great number of worthy <hi>Divines,</hi> by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> by <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> by <hi>Lutherans,</hi> by all ſorts of Chriſtians; but themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now, when a Cauſe Condemned by ſeveral able and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judges, at ſeveral times, and in ſeveral places, is, by a Bill of <hi>Revival,</hi> renewed and brought upon the Stage again with the ſelf-<hi>ſame Witneſſes,</hi> and the ſelf-<hi>ſame Evidence;</hi> if the Proper Judges, to free themſelves and others from a great deal of needleſs trouble, ſhould <hi>reject</hi> and caſt it out of the Court without any further Hearing, I think there would be no foul play in doing ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:108129:19"/>
But we have not treated our modern <hi>Socinians</hi> thus; For did any of them ever deſire a perſonal Conference with any of our Learned Divines, and was rejected? Did any of them ever provoke the profeſſours of Divinity in either of our Univerſities, to a publick Diſputation, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed? Are not their Writings and ours to be ſeen, and had in many Shops in <hi>London, Oxford, Cambridge,</hi> and other great Towns and Cities? Have they not received our printed Anſwers to their printed Objections? If they have, Why ſhould this Author complain for want of fair Play? Why ſhould he unworthily tell the World, that we dare not ſuffer our Religion to undergo a fair Trial, for fear it ſhould prove Falſe?</p>
            <p>No, we do not doubt the <hi>Truth</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> nor the <hi>Ability</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> to defend it; but our Lord tells, <hi>Falſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matt. xxiv. 1 2 Pet. ii. 2.</note>
               <hi>Prophets ſhall deceive many;</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>They ſhall bring in damnable Doctrines;</hi> and yet he tells us, <hi>Many ſhall follow their pernicious ways.</hi> Theſe Texts do make us jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that many weak, eaſie, and credulous Men may be corrupted by the <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> and <hi>Fallacies</hi> of <hi>Socinian</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, for that Reaſon ſhould not be publiſhed.</p>
            <p>But, may our Author reply, and in effect he doth ſo, What danger can there be in <hi>publiſhing</hi> ſuch Arguments, ſince, if they be <hi>falſe,</hi> we have great ſtore of Divines able to <hi>confute</hi> them? We have ſo, and bleſs God for it; But what then? Muſt we permit the Souls of Men to be <hi>poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> becauſe we abound with <hi>Sovereign Antidotes?</hi> Muſt we permit the <hi>Church</hi> our <hi>Mother,</hi> or her <hi>Sons</hi> who are our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> to receive <hi>Wounds</hi> in their <hi>Heads,</hi> becauſe we have <hi>Balſam</hi> enough to <hi>Cure</hi> them? We would take a better courſe than ſo, and follow the old Rule, <hi>venienti occurrite morbo,</hi> prevent the <hi>Poyſon,</hi> and then we need not uſe any <hi>Antidotes;</hi> prevent the <hi>Wound,</hi> and then there is no need of <hi>Plaiſters;</hi> ſo here, if we can, by a due Regulation of the Preſs, prevent the ſpreading of <hi>erroneous Doctrines,</hi> there will be no need of <hi>Confutations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if Men of reſtleſs Spirits be ſtill permitted to diſturb the Peace of our Church, and ſtagger the Faith of weak Believers, by publiſhing Arguments, which only ſeem to be plauſible, againſt the Fundamental Articles of our Creed,

But to juſtifie this ſtrange Paradox, this Author ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns this Reaſon; <hi>two ſuch Perſons, the one after a due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, profeſſing a true Religion; the other a falſe one, are equally in the way to Heaven, becauſe in following their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they both have done what God requires.</hi> That's his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but there's a fallacy in it; for, doth not God require, and doth not Reaſon oblige us, in order to our Salvation, to obey one Command as well as another? One Command is this, <hi>prove all things;</hi> another immediately follows, <hi>hold faſt that which is good.</hi> Now, if one Man obey the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe Commands <hi>only,</hi> and another obey them <hi>both,</hi> they do not equally do what God requires, nor conſequently are they equally in the way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>And this is the Caſe of two Perſons, who, after an equal Examination, hold two different Religions, the one a True, and the other a Falſe one; the Obedience of the one is only, <hi>ſecundùm quid,</hi> he obeyeth but this ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>prove all things;</hi> but the other obeyeth this and that too, <hi>hold faſt that which is good,</hi> which a <hi>Falſe</hi> Religion can never be. And if ſo, How can two ſuch Perſons be in an equal Capacity of Salvation, except a <hi>wrong</hi> way do as directly lead to Heaven as the <hi>right</hi> one?</p>
            <p>There is another Aſſertion in the ſame Paragraph, which I cannot paſs over without ſome Reflections upon it, and 'tis this; <hi>The perverſe holding of Religion; i. e.</hi> taking it up on truſt, <hi>whether it be true or falſe, is Hereſie.</hi> This definition of Hereſie is to me a new one, and repugnant to many old ones, which I have met with.</p>

               </gap>, one that chuſeth ſome Opinion beſides, or againſt the Truth.</p>
            <p>Theſe Definitions of Ancient Divines inform us what their Thoughts were concerning <hi>Hereſie;</hi> namely, that it was nothing elſe but an Opinion held againſt ſome Truth. But this late Author is of another mind, for he tells us, <hi>That the taking up a Religion on truſt, though the true one, is Hereſie, and according as Men are more or leſs partial in examining, they are more or leſs heretical.</hi> But if this be ſo, then muſt the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> depend on the bare act of Examination, which cannot be, becauſe Truth will remain Truth, whether it be examined or not; the ſtricteſt Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination doth not <hi>conſtitute</hi> Truth, but only makes it <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed he, who takes up a true Religion barely upon truſt, may be to blame; but his Fault is not <hi>Hereſie,</hi> but <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence</hi> and Diſobedience; 'tis not, as <hi>Hereſie</hi> is, an <hi>Errour</hi> in point of <hi>Judgment,</hi> but a <hi>Sin</hi> in point of <hi>Practice;</hi> 'tis not the <hi>Violation</hi> of a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but the <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of a <hi>Command.</hi> So that whatever Title we may give ſuch a Man, we cannot juſtly brand him with the Name of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick.</p>

               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:108129:21"/>
But yet our Author, from theſe foregoing Premiſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers this as an <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> or granted Concluſion; <hi>ſo that 'tis not, what a Man profeſſeth; but, how, that juſtifieth or condemns him before God;</hi> No. Is the <hi>what</hi> excluded? And is the, <hi>how,</hi> all? Suppoſe a Man profeſs the Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> with the greateſt <hi>Devotion</hi> that can be, would not the <hi>what</hi> condemn him, or would the <hi>how</hi> excuſe him? Suppoſe a <hi>Jew</hi> with the higheſt <hi>Reverence</hi> ſhould have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up a <hi>Swine</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Lamb,</hi> would not the <hi>what,</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> of his Sacrifice, notwithſtanding its exacteſt <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> have rendred it abominable? The Truth is, God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders both the <hi>what</hi> and the <hi>how,</hi> the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and its <hi>circumſtances</hi> too; and if ſo, Why doth this Man tell us, 'tis not the <hi>what,</hi> but the <hi>how?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now being wearied with purſuing this Author through ſo many impertinent Allegations againſt the Reſtraint of the Preſs, I ſhall take my leave of him when I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded two Arguments againſt that unlimited Liberty of the Preſs, for which he is ſo zealous an Advocate, and and that, I fear, upon an ill Deſign; and my firſt Argument is this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Since this unlimited Liberty of the Preſs would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be, as this Author himſelf doth not deny, an in-let to Schiſms, Hereſies, and a great variety of Opinions and Practices in Matters of Religion; the allowance of it can never conſiſt with that Command of God, contend earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Jude 3.</note>for the Faith once delivered to the Saints.</p>
            <p>This Text ſuppoſeth that the true Faith, or which is all one, the true Religion, is but one; and that for that one, we are to <hi>Contend,</hi> and that <hi>Earneſtly</hi> too: Now, to allow an unlimited Liberty to the Preſs, which will open a wide Gap to introduce falſe Religions, is ſo far from a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>for</hi> the one true Faith, that it is indeed a contending <hi>againſt</hi> it; and therefore ſuch an allowance is a direct breach of this Command.</p>
            <p n="2">

2. Since this unlimited Liberty of the Preſs would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prove an in-let to Schiſms, Hereſies, and falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, the allowance of it would be contradictory to the Judgment and Practice of the univerſal Church in all Ages.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Church of Chriſt in all Ages had not the uſe of a Preſs, but if the late Art of Printing, without any due Reſtraint ſhould prove a means to introduce an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Hereſies; the allowance of ſuch a Liberty, and thoſe numerous Errours, with which it would be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, would be diametrically oppoſite to the Judgment and Practice of the Catholick Church from one Generation to another.</p>
            <p>Now, the Queſtion which relates to the Caſe in hand, is this; How did the <hi>Primitive</hi> Saints deal with thoſe Men, who differed in Opinion from the received Doctrine of the Catholick Church? They followed St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Rule, 2 Tim. 2. 25. <hi>In meekneſs inſtruct thoſe that oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> they did ſo, they uſed all gentle and rational means to reduce them; but when this would not do, What courſe took they then? Did they indulge them? Did they give them an univerſal Liberty of Conſcience? Surely no; and to prove this, three Things ſhall be ſhewed. Firſt, That an <hi>unlimited Toleration</hi> of all Opinions and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Matters of Religion, is contrary to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Practice of <hi>particular</hi> Learned Men in the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church.</hi>

            <p>In ſuch a juncture of time as this, it was very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily done of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to get the conſent of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league <hi>Licinius</hi> to a General Toleration of all Religions, that ſo the Chriſtian might be Comprehended in it; and ſuch a <hi>preſent Toleration</hi> did he procure in order to a <hi>future Eſtabliſhment</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
            <p>And that this was indeed his preſent Deſign is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what he afterwards did; for, when he became the ſole Emperor, and was well ſettled in the Throne, he made it his great buſineſs to ſuppreſs all falſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Eſtabliſh that of Chriſt; <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us, that there was ſent out by him a Law. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="5">5. 'Tis certain that an unlimited Toleration of all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and Practices in Matters of Religion is directly contrary to the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> to the Will of God revealed in his written Word.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> was never permitted to teach and do, what they pleaſed, about the things of God; they were not allowed to ſerve their Maker, as they <hi>Liſted;</hi> they were obliged to Sacrifice <hi>when, where,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> they were Commanded.

            <p>And as there is no ſuch thing to be found in the <hi>Law</hi> or the <hi>Prophets;</hi> ſo there is very little or nothing to be met with in the whole <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that gives any Countenance to ſuch a Practice; the main place, which ſeems to look that way, is in the Parable of the <hi>Tares;</hi> of which 'tis ſaid, <hi>Let them grow until the Harveſt,</hi> what means our <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 30.</note>

And ſince St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who well knew the Mind of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did, upon juſt occaſion, make uſe of his <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Rod</hi> to puniſh, not only <hi>Immoralities</hi> in Life, but <hi>Errors</hi> in Judgment too; we may thence infer, that an <hi>unlimited</hi> Toleration of all Opinions in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion hath no manner of Countenance from the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> we read, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> made uſe of this <hi>Rod,</hi> to ſtrike <hi>Elymas</hi> blind; and why he <note place="margin">Act. viii. 10.</note>did ſo, that Expreſſion intimates, <hi>Wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</hi> It was for his <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing</hi> the Goſpel, and that in all probability aroſe from the <hi>Error</hi> of his Judgment. But the Caſe is yet more plain in the Example of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have delivered them to</hi>

               <hi>the Truth.</hi> It was for their <hi>ill Opinion</hi> about one Article of our <hi>Creed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Inſtances are enough to ſhew that a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Opinions and Practices in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was never thought to be lawful, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch an unlimited Liberty of the Preſs, as tends to bring in, and ſpread Errors and Hereſies, ought not to be allowed.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall take my leave of my Reader, when I have admoniſhed him, that in all this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I plead for the Regulation of the Preſs, as to ſuch Books only, as concern Morality, Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip, of which, our Learned Eccleſiaſtical Governours are the moſt proper Judges. But as to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and State Affairs, they fall under the Cognizance of the Civil Magiſtrate, whoſe Province it is, and whoſe

Care it ſhould be, to prevent the publiſhing of all ſuch Pamphlets as tend to promote popular Tumults, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Treaſon, and Rebellion. And had this been carefully done ſome Years ago, it might have happily prevented thoſe dreadful Confuſions, under which our Church and State now do, and ſtill are too like to groan.</p>
