            <title>A pill to purge melancholy: or merry newes from Newgate: wherein is set forth, the pleasant jests, witty conceits, and excellent couzenages, of Captain James Hind, and his associates. How Hind, putting on a bears skin, attempted to rob a committeeman at Oxford of 200 l. and how he had like to have been worried by a mastiff dog; and what means he used to free himself from the fury of the mastiff, and afterwards got the money. How Hind cheated an excize-man of his mare, which was esteemed one of the best in England; and being afterwards apprehended for her at Newark, how neatly he made his escape, and got the mare again. How Hind disguising himself in womens apparel, gul'd an old lawyer in the temple of 14 l. shewing him such a trick in the law, that he never knew before. How Hind having knowledge that the old lawyer had 100 l. more in his trunk which stood in his chamber, devised a way to get that also; and how he was serv'd by a gentleman of the temple, who new christen'd him. With a variety of other delightfull passages, never heretofore published by any pen.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117351:3"/>
knowing him to be a ſtranger, they all ſaluted him; amongſt the reſt, one of them who was called Captain <hi>Smugſon,</hi> was ſo ſweet upon him, that he could not be rid of him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Hind</hi> deſired him to hold him excus'd, for he was no ſuch kind of perſon as he took him for; <hi>Smugſon</hi> thinking he meant, he was no Whore, but an honeſt Gentlewoman, replyed, <hi>What a poz do you here then?</hi> Come for a Wench as well as your ſelf you blind Owl, replyed <hi>Hind;</hi> and with that puld off his bag; &amp; the other knew him to be his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; the reſt laughing heartily at the miſtake. After they had carouſed a while, and ſpent their time in merry diſcourſe, one of the <hi>Ladies</hi> deſired <hi>Hind</hi> to walk forth, and take up a <hi>Cully</hi> (for that is the phraſe they give them) and bring him thither, and they would make excellent ſport with him, telling him, if he went but to the Temple he ſhould be ſure to ſpeed; he delighting in waggery as well as the beſt of them, condiſcended; and forth he marches in the aforeſaid habit: And walking between the two Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gates, was encountred by an old ruſty <hi>Lawyer,</hi> one that lov'd his money ſo well, that he could not afford himſelf a good meals meat, yet would give a Crown or an Angel to a handſome Whore; This lump of Corruption, meeting with our piece of Mortality, caſt ſuch a laſcivious look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that <hi>Hind</hi> preſently ſuppos'd him a man fit for his purpoſe, and therupon he turn'd back, and lookt after him, Grub ſeeing him look ſo after him, thought him to be a Wench that was right for his purpoſe, and thereupon he came back again, ſaying; <hi>Lady, I am confident I have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly acquainted with you;</hi> and Sir, replyed <hi>Hind, I think I have been in your company, but I cannot call to mind where;</hi> if it pleaſe you (ſaith the Lawyer) let us drink half a pint to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the Devil Tavern, and perhaps we ſhall call one another to mind; to which <hi>Hind</hi> conſented; and ſo <hi>they went hand in hand to the Devil</hi> (as all Lawyers and Thieves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117351:4"/>
will, <hi>without repentance</hi>) When they came there, the <hi>Lawyer</hi> cal'd for a whole half pint, in the drinking of which he did ſo beſlaber <hi>Hind,</hi> and lick him under the ſnot-gall, that he wiſh'd himſelf rid of him; but at laſt they concluded, and agreed, That the <hi>Lawyer</hi> ſhould give <hi>Hind</hi> 10 s. to do the feat; but they could not agree upon the place; <hi>Hind</hi> would have had him to have gone with him to his lodging (as he cal'd it) where his companions were, to have made ſport with him there; but the <hi>Lawyer</hi> thinking that further charges would ariſe from thence, would not conſent to it, but perſwaded him to go with him to his chamber in the Temple, into which he might privatly enter, and ſo depart undiſcovered. <hi>Hind</hi> ſeeing he ſhould be diſappointed of the mirth he intended to have had with him, vow'd to himſelf he would have his money, and ſo he conſented to go with him thither: as ſoon as he was enter'd, he welcom'd him with an old <hi>Letchers</hi> kiſs, and deſired him to ſit upon the bed by him, which he did, and then the <hi>Lawyer</hi> began to put his hand under his petticoat; but <hi>Hind</hi> deſired him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear a while, ſwearing he ſhould not touch him before he had his money; Why think'ſt thou Love I'le be worſe then my word (quoth the <hi>Lawyer</hi>) and with that puts his hand in his pocket, and puls out a good quantity of ſilver, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 14 l. pieces of gold, and gave <hi>Hind</hi> his 10 s. which he had agreed for: <hi>Hind</hi> putting that into his pocket, pul'd out his piſtol immediatly, and ſetting it to his breaſt, ſware if he ſpake loud, or cryed out, he would piſtoll him: ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Gag out of his pocket (for good work-men never go without their Tools) he gagd him, and bound him, and eaſing his pockets of his gold, in that manner left him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his company, and giving them a relation of his adventure; at which the Wenches laugh'd heartily, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all old letcherous Curmudgions were ſo ſerved; for, ſaid they, they have by their covetouſneſs ſpoyl'd our

               <p>HIND having left the old Letcher, in manner as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related, could not be ſatisfied till he was reſolved what became of him after he had left him; and therefore he requeſted one Col. <hi>Scarface</hi> (a companion of his) to go to the Temple, and enquiring for his chamber, to pretend ſome buſineſs with him, and ſo (in all probability) he might hear how he came to be releaſt out of that purgatory which he had left him in; at whoſe requeſt <hi>Scarface</hi> went very early, &amp; when he came to his chamber door, he found it open, and the old Lawyer in the ſame poſture that <hi>Hind</hi> had left him in; who preſently ungagging him, ſeemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to pity him, demanding what Villain had dealt ſo inhumanely with him, who very faintly anſwered him (for he was almoſt ſpent with lying ſo long in that condition) <hi>That the laſt night there came a fellow and knoekt at his chamber door, and he opening it to ſee who it was, he violently laid hands on him, &amp; drawing out a piſtol, threatned to ſhoot him if he made any noiſe, or ſtir'd; ſo ſearching of his pockets, he took what money he found there, and ſo left him in that manner as he found him;</hi> ſaying moreover, <hi>that if he had not come ſo opportunely to have releaſt him, he thought he ſhould have periſht. Scarface</hi> deſiring to ſift him further, ſaid; but Sir, <hi>Did he take nothing from you but your money? No, I thank God</hi> (replyed the Lawyer) <hi>nor all that neither, for I had</hi> 100 l. <hi>in my Trunk, which by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:117351:5"/>
                  <hi>eſcaped his clutches. Scarface</hi> ſaid it was a miraculous preſervation, and that he might rejoyce Fortune dealt ſo favourably with him: ſo breaking off that diſcourſe (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as he ſuppoſed got ſufficient intelligence from him) he began to tell him what buſineſs he came about, and laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his caſe ſo handſomly, that the Lawyer promiſed him he would warrant him the better of his Adverſary, and that he would follow it for him with all diligence: ſo (deſiring him to be careful) he gave him his Fee, and departed. And coming to <hi>Hind,</hi> he told him what had hapned, and what diſcourſe had paſſed between them, blaming him for loſing ſuch a fortune: <hi>Soft</hi> (quoth <hi>Hind) it is not loſt, forbearance is no quittance; ere many dayes paſs, I'le have that too.</hi> So after <hi>Scarface</hi> and he had ſteeld their Noſes with 3 or 4 quarts of Sack, he went to a handſome Whore of his acquaintance, and beſtowing of a quart of Wine or two upon her, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſcourſe with her, telling her, <hi>If ſhe would be ruled by him, he would help her to a buſineſs that ſhe ſhould get</hi> 10 l. <hi>by.</hi> She (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing, poor Whore, to get money) promiſed him her aſſiſtance: Then <hi>Hind</hi> told her, that ſhe ſhould go with him to the Temple, and that there was an old fellow there that he was confident would take her up, and carry her to his chamber, and that then ſhe ſhould take an opportunity to let him in, and then the buſineſs ſhould immediatly be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with ſecurity. Having paſſed away the time in this and the like diſcourſe, <hi>Hind</hi> paid the reckoning, and ſo they departed toward the Temple; and by the way as they went he gave her further inſtructions what they ſhould do. When they came to the Temple gate, <hi>Hind</hi> and his <hi>Landa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides</hi> went ſculking up and down thereabouts waiting for their prey; and having been an hour or two in expectation of him, and ſeeing him not come, he began to be impatient, and walking towards his chamber, it hapned that one of the Gentlemen of the Houſe having been early at the ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117351:5"/>
had gotten his load, and riſing to empty it, hapned to throw it out juſt upon his head, which made him almoſt mad; but he might be ſtark mad if he would, for he knew not how to help himſelf in that place: but being in the heat of his fury, he hapned to caſt his eyes up to the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers chamber window, and eſpyed a light in it, which made him confident he was about ſome earneſt buſineſs, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he would hardly come out that night: whereupon he went over to the Lyon-Tavern, and calling for a pint of Sack, ſent one of the Drawers for him, bidding him to tell him, <hi>That there was a Countrey Gentleman at their houſe that muſt needs ſpeak with him;</hi> giving his Ningle charge to keep her ſtation, and he was confident he would not paſs her, for he would leave the beſt friends company he had for a Whore: The Drawer having delivered <hi>Hinds</hi> meſſage to him, he laid by his Writings, and bad him certifie the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman he would wait upon him immediatly. As ſoon as the Drawer was departed, the Lawyer ſetting his candle in the Chimney-corner, look'd his Chamber door, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him down ſtairs; but coming to the Temple gate, eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hinds Landabrides,</hi> and not being able to paſs ſo fair an Object, ſtood gazing upon Her; and obſerving Her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtation, ſuppoſed ſhe wanted a companion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon He made bold thus to ſalute Her; <hi>Lady, 'tis pity ſo excellent a Creature as your ſelf ſhould wait thus unattended, wil't pleaſe you to accept of my ſervice.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117351:6"/>
the Lawyer bid the Drawer ſhew them a room above ſtaires, and kindle them a couple of Faggots. <hi>Hind</hi> being in a room near the Bar, ſeeing them enter together, thought his buſineſs half done; and the Wench eſpying of <hi>Hind</hi> gave him a wink, and went up with her froſty lover; the fire being kindled, and wine brought up, as ſoon as the Drawer had voided the room, the Lawyer began afreſh to court his Miſtreſs, and to kiſs and hug her cloſe to him, proffering to fell her <hi>Conundrum,</hi> &amp; call which ſhe patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered; but whiles He was buſied that way, ſhe was not unmindful of <hi>Hinds</hi> inſtructions; but diving into His pocket, got His key out, which was that ſhe lookt for; which when ſhe had gotten, ſhe deſired Him to excuſe Her a while, for ſhe muſt go down and ſpeak with the Maid, He ſuſpecting nothing, could not deny Her requeſt; ſo down ſhe went to <hi>Hind,</hi> and delivered Him the Key; He having what He lookt for, was not long in paying his reckoning, but went immediatly about his buſineſs; and coming to his chamber, unlockt the door; and breaking open His Trunk, ſecured his money for him; and locking his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door again, returned to the Tavern. The Wench having given <hi>Hind</hi> the Key, returned again to the Lawyer, who began again to uſe her as formerly, but ſhe deſired him to forbear ſuch behaviour; but if he would come to ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with her, ſhe would go with him to a more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate place, where they might with the more ſecurity do the feat: Thus ſhe held him in play till <hi>Hind</hi> returned, who immediatly ſent up a Drawer to her, to tell her, <hi>That there was a Gentleman would ſpeak with her;</hi> at which the old Lawyer ſeemed to be diſcontented; but ſhe promiſed him, <hi>that let it be who it would, ſhe would but know his buſineſs, and return to him immediatly:</hi> With which he was ſomewhat pacified. When ſhe came to <hi>Hind,</hi> He told her <hi>he had effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi>

                  <hi>his buſineſs;</hi> and giving her the key, wiſh'd her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it into his pocket again, and ſo take her leave of him: ſo up ſhe went again to her ſweet <hi>Swatterlin,</hi> who praiſed her for being conſtant to her vvord, and asked her who it was ſent for her? beſtowing many laſcivions kiſſes upon her; whiles in the interim ſhe conveyed the key again into his pocket; which done, ſhe told him, <hi>that it was her brother had ſent for her, and that ſhe muſt needs go along with him:</hi> Whereat the Lawyer began to fret; but upon her promiſe to meet him again to morrow, he conſented; and ſo ſhe went to <hi>Hind,</hi> who made no ſtaying there, but went to a more convenient place to give the Wench what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her, leaving the <hi>Lawyer</hi> in a ſad condition, <hi>having loſt both Wench and Money.</hi>
