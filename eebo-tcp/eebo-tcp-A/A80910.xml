            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DECLARATION of his Highneſs, Setting apart <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 23. of this preſent <hi>May</hi> for a publique day of Thankſgiving, for the Peace concluded between this Commonwealth, and that of the United Provinces, and for the late ſeaſonable Rain.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat this hath been a Nation of bleſſings in the midſt whereof ſo many wonders have been brought forth by the out-ſtretched arm of the Almighty, even to aſtoniſhment, and wonder, Who can deny? Ask we the Nations of this matter and they will teſtify, and indeed the diſpenſations of the Lord have been as if he had ſaid, <hi>England</hi> thou art my firſt-born, my delight amongſt the Nations, under the whole Heavens the Lord hath not dealt ſo with any of the people round about us.</p>
            <p>The Lord having added another Link to this golden Chain of his loving kindneſs by giving us a Peace with Our Neighbours the United Provinces, (whereby he hath not only ſtopped a great iſſue of blood, but We truſt alſo given us hearts to unite Our bloud and ſtrength for the mutual defence of each other) cals for great return of Thanks for the ſame.</p>
            <p>It is therefore thought fit to ſet apart <hi>Tueſday,</hi> being the 23. of this preſent <hi>May,</hi> as a day for Praiſe, and for the Thankful Acknowledgement of this bleſſing of Peace, which we hope hath in the womb of it many other bleſſings.</p>
            <p>And let us not forget our other Mercies, was not the Earth lately ſo unuſually parcht up, that it threatned Famin, and did cauſe the Beaſt of the field to mourn for want of food, and water to ſuſtain it? And hath not the Lord ſo watered the Earth that he hath turned thoſe fears into the expectation of the greateſt plenty that ever was ſeen by any now living in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Conſider we alſo the way whereby the Lord imparted this mercy to us, did any amongſt us, foreknow it was coming, was it not by ſtirring up our hearts to ſeek the ſame by prayer, and that immediately before the Lord vouchſafed us this mercy? And doth not this beſpeak? 1. That the manner of conveying this mercy is the beſt part of the mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Lord has not caſt us off, that his Spirit yet ſtrives with us, that he hath a people of his love amongſt us, and loves the Nation ſo far as to provoke it to be in love with calling upon the Name of the Lord for better things than Corn and Wine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he knows beſt how and when to anſwer the expectation of the Husbandman, and when to hear, even the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the brute Beaſt, who will yet much more hear the deſires of them that fear him, and that in the fitteſt ſeaſon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Heavens having thus declared the glory of God, and the Earth anſwering thereunto in its fruitfulneſs, Why ſhould not we be melted and ſoftned, humbling our ſelves under theſe marvellous kindneſſes, and abounding unto all fruitfulneſs in every good word and work of love; And if every place hath been made partaker of his ſhowres, Why ſhould not we (laying aſide our differences) be inlarged alſo each to other?</p>
            <p n="5">5. That ſeeing the Lord hath been thus univerſal in this Mercy, why ſhould we not univerſally turn from the National Evils and vain Practices which yet are too ſuperſtitiouſly and cuſtomarily exerciſed amongſt us, which we need not repeat here, becauſe they are too well known, and We truſt will be remembred by thoſe godly Miniſters who ſhall be called to preach unto the People upon this occaſion? Conclude we with the words of <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 107. <hi>v.</hi>
