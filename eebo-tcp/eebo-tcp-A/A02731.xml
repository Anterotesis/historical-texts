            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which when it seemed good vnto God, that I with some others should doo, by abyding imprisonment a certayne time: Then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

offered our selues to suffer whatsoeuer our vexers should lay vpon vs, and espyinge nothing like to be done vnto vs, but to bee holden with lingering imprisonement, and that without libertie of communicating vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others the instruction of the same cause, which we professed: wee thought good ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vndergoe some exile (as it were) for redeeming at least some libertie of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God with safetie of conscience. Which when we did, and diuers of our Brethren, which were willing to come vnto vs were restrayned: and we were persuaded, that to returne vnto them thither, whereas by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment we should againe be holden from them, would litle anayle: I haue iudged that we haue bene debters to them to bestow vpon them some thing which might helpe to increase their spirituall courage and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte. In which behalfe, when the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me and diuers others rested vppon some, who in the ende did but slenderlie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, and satisfie thesame: Then I, which for my vnworthines and poore gifte, hadde thought neuer to haue set foorth any thinge publikely, yet was prouoked to indeuour my selfe, in some parte, as farre as the Lorde should make me able, to satisfie that want, which I thought to be great. And I went about a piece of work touching Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement. But partlie by sicknes, &amp; partly by weying the cost of the print, and findinge it to be aboue my reache of abilitie: I was hindered, and haue let staye that worke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Lorde further inable mee.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:12802:2"/>In the meane tyme I thought good to write some other little treatse, and I chose this 122.

And I was determined to haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what brieflie vpon the whole Psalme. But in the firste entraunce meetinge with those pointes, which I thought good they should be discussed somewhat largelie for edifyinge sake: Agayne, sicknes and other causes cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me short: I was constreined to ende at this time skarce finishing the firste verse. Neyther was it my desire to seeme to speak much vppon a little Texte, (yea I confesse that I haue passed the boundes of Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler like handeling the Text) but the thinges which offered them selues to be spoken of, seemed to my iudgement to require so much measure. Herein my desire vnto the lord is, that my poore labour may be accepted of him, and may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to his people.</p>

But our Cleargie firste, which should with great affliction haue laboured about the Lords worke, to haue seene that firste finished, before they hadde instauled them selues into their owne rowmes: they contrariewise layde holde on the great liuings, catch who catche might the riche Bishoprikes and fatte Benefices.</p>

            <p>Wee also haue done as that other generation of the Iewes which arose vp after Iosua, which regarded their owne ease more then the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and his glorie, which stoode vpon the rootinge out of those wicked ones, whose sinne was ripe &amp; their daie was come: those Cananites Perezites, and Iebuzits suffered they to dwell still amonge them.

Euen so haue we tenne times more made couenant with that cursed broode of Antichrists birdes, not only entring into neare familiaritie with the men, but also borowing manie of their ceremonies, intertaining their forme of seruice for the most part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned but from Latin to English: and yet which is worse, holding our neckes vnder their gyrdles, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our selues willing slaues to their

Ecclesiasticall sworde. And because this practise could sonest be atchiued, and this vngracious work could most spedelie be iumbled vp: then was it counted Pollicie, to wipe mens noses with, and to giue them amocke. But be not deceiued, God is non mocked, who redemed you from aduersitie to this ende, that you should deale wisely and faithfullie in all his house. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it did stand you vpon to haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better aduisement in the reforming of religion, and matters about Gods worshippe, knowinge that aboue all thinges it is a matter most curious. And you shoulde with feare and much trembling, setting apart your owne effaires for a season, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did here and that with a solemne vow making, that you would first seeke the building of Gods kingdome: you should thus, I say, haue bene conuersant in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, knowing that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all things wold haue prospered with you. You shoulde also haue known y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the lord in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship might not admit ani strang deuise vnder pretense of pleasing some, nor might
<pb facs="tcp:12802:10"/>
admit anie mingling of his wisedome with mennes wisedome, anie tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of vanities with a smoothe and fayned promise to take them away in time to come. Why did the Lorde shewe such a terrible and fearefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample vpon the two sonnes of <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> &amp; <hi>Abihu,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leui.</hi> 10.1.</note> as to skortche them with fire from heauen? Because they tooke fire for their censeres, from the hearth, whiche they should haue taken from the Altar. And they were but yong schollers in those ceremonies, &amp; the obseruations were manie, and it was at the firste beginninge of their trayning to practise: yet the Lordes ielousie burned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fire. And why? Had the Lord so great regarde, for a coale of fire? was it not to leaue a fearfull monument for all men to beholde, that they might take heed least in matters pertaining to the worshippe of God, they alter and chaunge euen the least thinge? If any man want skill, let him withdrawe himselfe. For it is written: Take heed to thy foote when thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trest into the house of God,<note place="margin">

howe they haue drawne their liues so farre wrong, that skilfull workemen, yea nowe euery bungler can not but wonder to see suche worke. For they haue framed their timber, some toe longe, and some toe short, in such sort, that the buildinge hangeth all on the one side, tottering and reeling with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie wind, and waiteth but for a blast from the Lorde to cause it to fall, and to slaie all those, which haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to such a false building.

            <p>And whereas some saye, what? It is a house, though it be a downegate thinge, though it want roufe, though some walles, though it want this and that. Manie such songes the babes in the cradle heare, to rocke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a sleape. But by their own words I will iudge them.

And yet these chief builders of whom I haue spoken, manie of them, yea most of them haue confessed and doo confesse vntill this daye, that manie thinges are amisse in the Church, and yet we must be content and beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

wanting and missing to the finishing of the Lordes house, and can they sitt still and eate and drinke, and not buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle them selues to their busines? Or may the Lordes worke aboue other things suffer delaye, and waite oure good leysure? Or are they the Lords remembrauncers, which can giue him rest, and them selues also,<note place="margin">

This is counted but a small want. O deepe securitie! This wee must beare: and we are content so to doo, as longe as the Lorde hath made anie promise to beare with wickednes.

In deede, there was a time careleslie slipped at the beginninge, when the yron was whote, but the workemen were lasie, and neglected to frame and fashion the work, before the yron was colde.

Iewes in Babilon, though to speake of it wil be thought of some, straying from my matter, yet I must regarde edifying more then anie other order.

            <p>Thus haue we hearde concerninge the care, which Dauid had for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging home the Arke.

Yet for all his fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
<pb facs="tcp:12802:25"/>
and exceeding great care, it pleased God to humble him, by that great iudgement, whiche fell vppon <hi>Vzzah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.</note> that hee might bee sifted, and tried to the vttermost, and the Lorde spared not Dauid, in that litle thinge which was committed awrye, in that the Arke was caried on a carte, and drawne by Oxen, which ought to haue bene borne vppon the <hi>Leuites</hi> shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.<note place="margin">

But what haue our reformers

of diuers whiche haue gone before, euen in the right path, though not with steadie foote, but haue slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, halted, and falne in the waye by committing some thinge whiche haue displeased the Lorde, as sometime in the chiefe Citie in Englande, there were manie whiche withdrewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from this spirituall bondage mentioned. But some onelie making conscience at the Cappe &amp; Surplesse, and therein stoode all their religion. Some entring that waye, despised all other, but pitied them not in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles of compassion, that they might be brought vnto the trueth, but were proude in their owne conceyte. Moste of them also ignoraunt howe they should come to the ende, or yet to the middest of the waye, which they hadd entred, neyther being humble in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out the same, but thinking ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they knew all things. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wer tried and weighed, manie were found too light, and their miscarying of the Lords Arke, and the iudgement which fell vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some of

            <p>And of late an other attempt haue bene giuen that waie by one, of whom I must needs saie, that the Lord vsed him as a meanes to bringe the trueth to light, in manie points concerning the true gouernement of the Churche: who, I wish for the glorie of God, if it had ben his good pleasure, that he had stoode in integrity, without swaruing and leaninge to Antichristian pride, and bitternes.

the Lord, they must not meddle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling (saye they) although there be no callinge suffered and allowed of in a Realme or Dominion, but that which they confesse to bee vtterlie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. So must the flocke of Christe tarie and be starued, whilest we wayte for that, which they can not direct vs where to haue, or howe it should be. It must be, saye they, by diuers true Ministers calling and allowing him: and so he must be ordeyned. But howe manie of the Ministers in the Realme of England dare be seene in this doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?

But the lawfull calling and sending of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, whiche is the onelie meane to make them haue frutefull wombes to begette faythfull children, and fruteful brestes to nource the same: also dewe

gouuernement, which is the onelie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing of Christe his kingdome, &amp; the cutting short of sinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: Also oure Christian libertie to worshippe God with free conscience, according to his worde: and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ioyning in the true felowship and communion of Saintes: And to conclude, the meanes of our saluation must be kept from vs, vntill a ciuile law send them vnto vs, although there be neuer so long delay: as though they were not sent from heauen, and offred to all that will receyue them. We can defie the Papistes doctrine, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king part of our saluation, to hange vppon oure owne desertes: but wee canne not taste the bitternes of the roote of this doctrine, that the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of gods kingdome, for the meane and furtherance of our saluation must depend vpon ciuile power, and Christ Iesus with all things pertayning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, are made vnderlings therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and caused to daunce attendaunce vpon it. Those which walke after this doctrine and teache men so, doo break

not one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least, but one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test commaundements, teaching men so: and therefore shall be counted least in the kingdome of God, if they doe not repent.</p>
            <p>And agayne, concerning this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whiche must needes bee done by diuers Ministers which will not doo it: But admit they would, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence haue they their calling, sendinge, and authoritie, such as pertaineth to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister? Hadde they it not from those which sitt in the chayre of Antichrist? Yea, howe manie are in all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which haue bene so rightlie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned, but that their ordination haue come from the popishe Prelacie, with in three or foure generations at the most? Nowe if a man take a griffe of a sowre frute, and plant it, &amp; then take a griffe of that newe planted, &amp; plant that: and take of that agayne &amp; plant it the thirde time, and so continewe vnto the hundreth time: will it loose the sowrenes, and gather sweetnesse? No more can an vnlawefull callinge bring foorth a lawfull, though it des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende
<pb facs="tcp:12802:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from one to another an hundred or a thousande times. Therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they can approue the lawfulnesse of their calling to the ministerie vnder some other title then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which thei now haue by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Clergie: it will fall out, that there shal hardlie be found a Minister duelie called in all the worlde, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that there is small hope that euer ther shalbe anie. But whatsoeuer bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then they laye vpon vs, I laie no more vpon them, but that they hauinge the approuing and consent of their flocke, doo the works of a Minister, namely, that they feede their flocke wherof the holy ghost haue made them ouerseers, if they make not them selues vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, and that they keepe backe from them, nothing that is profitable.<note place="margin">

            <p>And moreouer, whereas they tie the Ordination of euerie Minister, as it were, vnto the girdle of other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that of necessitie it must at all times depende and staie vppon them: that is to laie a greater bondage vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churches, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are able to beare.
<pb facs="tcp:12802:37"/>
For admitt there be onelie one church in a nation, and they want a pastour: must they seeke ouer Sea and lande, to gett a minister ordained by other ministers? But what if there shoulde be but only one apparent to vs in the world: shall that church for euer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued, after they haue once wanted a minister, for default of authoritie to call and ordaine an other? By this reason, euery church should not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in it selfe, nor haue in it selfe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and power to continue by that measure of lines which the Lord haue measured out vnto it. And is it not a dishonour to Christ Iesus the head of euery congregation, which is his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: to say that his body together with the heade, is not able to be sustained and preserued in it selfe?</p>
            <p>Moreouer I demaund what calling the dispersed disciples of the churche of Ierusalem had, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they did preache and teach the Gospell as they went? Were they all ordained ministers, by whose meanes it is said that manie did beleue,<note place="margin">

               </gap>egette, and bring forth as new borne children to God through the Gospell of his sonne: did they want authoritie to feede them and giue them sucke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so brought forth? Which if they might doo, then came they very neere to the work of the pastour, which hath his name of feeding. And was not only charitie a calling to these men, who meeting with such as they found worthie, ouerslipped not that occasion of doing so great good? If the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan be commended for doing the part of a neyghbour vnto him which fell among theeues and was wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 10.36</note> because he hadd compassion on him, tooke him vp, and washed his woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and in all thinges prouided for the safetie of his life: Why should they be reproued as passing the bounds of their calling, who meeting with sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les wounded by the sworde of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian robbers, or anie waie bound by Satan with the chaines of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce: shall helpe to loose them, and mollifie their woundes with the oile

            <p>In all this I denie not but that ther is vse of other Ministers, when they may be had, for mutuall help in trying and examining, &amp; alowinge those who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they finde meete, that by their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the other churches may so much the more be confirmed.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I passed the bounds of the texte somewhat in this discourse, I confesse. But I craue pardon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> and the euidence of things whiche are not seene. For hereby Dauid des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised all the glorious thinges with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible shewe, whiche belonged to his Royall kingdome, and did bidde them giue place, in comparison of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable treasure of Gods fauour, and all the good whiche flowe from thence, whiche he sawe not but by the eyes of fayth, and possessed onely by the title of that euidence, whiche is concerninge thinges not seene but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, yet herein hee ioyed fullie. The multitude saye:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal</hi> 4.6.</note> Who will cause vs to see good? They knowe what they see here, but they knowe not what they shall haue.

for their owne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things of this world But those thinges which out of Gods countenance turned towardes them, they do conceyue, they knowe for their owne, and they declare that they seeke an induring citie.</p>
            <p>So then euen as Dauid by faith had ouerquelled the Lion and the Beare, and by fayth had enterprised to fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> and had preuayled: so by fayth hee obteyned the bringinge home of the Arke. And though he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the firste to be disappointed, &amp; walked on his waye weeping, sowing deare seede (as did <hi>Abraham</hi> when he so long went without an heyre,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 126.6.</note> and at last was commaunded (as it were) to burie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hope which hee had of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in his onlie heyre, by appointing him vnto the death): Yet as <hi>Abraham</hi> did,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18.</note> so hee beleeued in hope against hope. Therefore in the Lords appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted day, hee returneth with mirth and gladnesse, bringing his sheaues with him, when as by fayth hee had gotten accesse vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace wherin he stoode,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2.</note> and reioiced vnder the hope of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:12802:39"/>
of God, wherein hee sawe a liuelie image in his holie Arke, with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted pledge of loue and fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him. Thus hee fayleth not of that wherewith hee strengthened his soule in the time of weaknes &amp; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, sayinge: Why art thou caste down, O my soule, and why art thou so disquieted within me!<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 42.11.</note> wayt on god for I shall yet see the time to giue him thankes for the helpe of his presence. He is my present helpe, and my God. Thus he wayted with patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which taught him experience, which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence brought forth the increase of his hope,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4.</note> and his hope made him not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: seeing hee was not disappointed of that he hoped for, but sawe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter saluation of the Lorde in the daye of his reioycing, to the further sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his hope, to wayte for greater things also at the Lordes hande. So we see that which I haue spoken, that by faith he entred into the Lords rest, when as the Lorde vouchsafed to haue his resting place and holy habitation with him, and by fayth he reioysed in
<pb facs="tcp:12802:40"/>
this, esteeming it aboue all other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of ioye, because he looked to those inuisibe ioyes, whiche hereby were promised and sealed vnto him.</p>
            <p>And nowe to applie this vnto our selues. This also is a glasse which we haue not dressed our selues by: for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie manie can saye, Waite, and tarie. But whither doo we thinke, that they meane, vntill the Lorde helpe and further their paynefull indeuour, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is neuer a whit, or vntill they haue filled their insatiable and bottomlesse Coffers with vncontrouled traphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? For, where is the disquiet and casting downe of the Soule? Where are the afflictions whiche the Lorde shoulde remember, as he did Dauids? Which shoulde whett the edge of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that patience might haue her perfect worke,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iames</hi> 1.4.</note> that they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire wanting nothing. But aboue all thinges, where is faith, without the which it is impossible to please God? And without the whiche God will not shewe his glorie before anie people, to their saluation, but to their confusion?
<pb facs="tcp:12802:40"/>
for want of which, our Sauior Christ wrought not those miracles in some places, whiche otherwise hee woulde haue done? Where is this faith, I saye, when those which are the chiefe and principall leaders of the people, which shoulde beare the Arke vppon their shoulders: they saye, and haue taught the people to say, It is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it should come home: and why? For not only the chiefe of the Clergie, but also the chief which haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reynes of the ciuile regiment, are against the establishing of church gouernement.

            <p>This also was a godly reioysing, as it is a godlie and commendable thing in all Kinges &amp; Princes, to haue care to see that matter so well ordered and disposed in the time of their life, as

For <hi>Dauid</hi> tooke this for an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble salutation at his seruaunts hands, when they saide:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 1.47</note> God make the name of <hi>Salomon</hi> more famous then thy name, and exalt his Throne aboue thy throne. This I say, was one ioye of <hi>Dauids,</hi> yet not comparable to the other: as appeared in that his care to beholde this thinge was not so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he was neere to haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slipped too longe, the laying of his hande to the furtheraunce thereof, in
<pb facs="tcp:12802:46"/>
respect of <hi>Adoniahs</hi> ouer hastie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and he had neede of stirringe vp by the sute of <hi>Bethsaba,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement of <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet. Whereas in the other busines of brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging home the Lords Arke, he neded no spurres to pricke him on forward. Flesh &amp; bloode kindled not that zeale in him, but the Lorde hadd inflamed his harte with the Spirit of loue and fire. And this burninge affection of loue bare he from time to time, vnto the Lords holy Tabernacle, for his trew worshipps sake, and his glorie therein appearing. And as it was his life to dwell in the Courts of the Lord by often frequenting them: so was it euen death and great distresse for him to be a straunger from the same, as appeareth by his pitifull complaints in the daies of his banishments, as when he sayeth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 42.2</note> As the Hart braieth for the Riuers of water: so panteth my soule after thee O God. My soule thirsteth for God, euen for the liuinge God. When shall I come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the presence of God?
<pb facs="tcp:12802:46"/>
His teares were his meate daye and night, and hee powred out his verie harte when hee remembred the deare times past, when he had gone with the multitude, and led them into the house of God with the voyce of singing and prayse, as a multitude that keepeth a feast. But we alas declare what poore and feeble ioye we would conceyue, if the Lorde would restore the glorie of his sonnes kingdome in open sight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our face, and purge his Court and Sanctuarie, &amp; plant vs therein, when as wee being berefte of this benefite, haue so small thirst, so little panting &amp; braying, and so little sadnes of soule, and shedding of teares, for this maner presence of the Lorde.</p>
            <p>Yea wee heare the voyces of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and the thoughtes of more lie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before the Lorde, whereof some saye, and some thinke, that they haue no great neede of Christ his Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall gouuernement, seeing they can gouerne them selues, and liue in the feare of the Lord wel ynough, as they imagine with them selues. Therefore
<pb facs="tcp:12802:47"/>
they sett their harts at rest. But haue they more staye of them selues, and towardnes vnto Godlines the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Dauid</hi> had? Or doo they thinke, that he was cleane absent from God, that he could not praie and prayse his name? Yet doo hee saie: When shall I come to appeare before the presence of God? And skarce could he comfort his own soule, whiche was then in heauines, though he hoped for a day of returne. Thus he accounted, that he shoulde stande before the presence of God, when he should be present in the place, which the Lorde did chuse to putt his name theare, and shoulde enioye the sight of those things, which the Lorde appointed for the tokens of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence amonge them. And therein was his great delight, according as he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.</note> saying: O Lord of hostes, how amiable ar thy tabernacles? My soule longeth, yea and fainteth for the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the Lorde. For mine hart and my fleshe reioyse in the liuing God. Blessed are they that dwell in thine house: they will euer prayse thee.
<pb facs="tcp:12802:47"/>
And although hee behaued him selfe carefullie before God, when hee was absent from the Lords tabernacle: yet he acknowledged his strength not to be so great, but that there was dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to be feared by the want of those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which the Lord had appointed as meanes to holde them in his true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe. For this cause he complaineth vnto <hi>Saul</hi> his persecutor, not so much for persecutinge him, as for chasinge him from the place where the Lorde vouchsafed to dwell. For he saith: If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord haue stirred thee vp against me,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 26.19.</note> let him smel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sauour of a sacrifice: but if the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men haue done it, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be they before the Lord: For they haue cast me out this day fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abyding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Goe serue other gods.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12802:48"/>For this cause were his prayers and teares. As appeareth by the worde which came from the Lorde by the mouth of the Prophete. Thus sayeth the Lorde God of Dauid thy Father, I haue hearde thy prayer, and seene thy teares. I haue healed thee, and the thirde day thou shalt g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e vp vnto the house of the Lorde.</p>
            <p>This zeale also &amp; loue to the Lords house appeared in the ancient fathers which returned from the captiuitie of Babilon, who as they coulde not bee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted in their exile, but sate down, &amp; wept by the riuers of Babel, when they remembred Sion. So in the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full time of their returne, yea in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day of laying the foundation of the Temple, which they aboue all things had desired, in the middest of the ioiful shouting and singing of the residue of the people, their hartes yet melted within them, &amp; they wept with a loude crying, in so muche that the noyse of the shoutinge could not bee discerned from the noyse of the weeping,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezra.</hi> 3.12.</note> and all was for this, because they had seene
<pb facs="tcp:12802:48"/>
the former Temple. And the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable to that. What shall wee saye, Did these olde men dote? were they fonde vppon an outward shewe of faire building? No: but as their chiefe delight was in the house of god, so the increase of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thereof, was their ioye, &amp; the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of the glorie therof, was their sorowe and griefe of minde. Thus ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous were they ouer Gods glorie, that in the outward shewes and shadowes they were impatient of any want. But amongst vs, there is small weepinge, though the buylders in their building haue left out the chiefe corner stone, which should be the garnishing of all the worke. They haue left out the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of Christ, without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which, that their Churche can bee his house, though they face and brace neuer so much, how should they thinke it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible? For they muste knowe, that Christe dwelleth not, where he ruleth not. He maye not bee an idle Idoll. His Churche and Kingdome in this worlde, is outwarde and visible, and
<pb facs="tcp:12802:49"/>
except he gouerne visiblie, euen by his outwarde ordinances: It is vayne for vs to say, He ruleth in our hartes: and in the church that we are ioyned vnto we submitt our selues to the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Antichrist. Wee shall soone ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe Christ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our hartes, if we haue no more care of his glorie then so, but can abide to see his Sanctuarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned and polluted by that Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe straunger of Rome, whiche not onelie set his foote in there euery day, but also erecteth there his owne altar of incense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For prayers and thankes giuing must bee measured out and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed after his fashion.</p>
            <p>If euer we had seene the beautie of the first building, I meane in the time of the primitiue Churche, wee might wel nowe, if we had not stonie hartes, weepe and lament with loude crying, in seeinge this buyldinge before oure eyes. Not so much for that it is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the other in glorie: but for that it hath neither glorie nor beautie at all, being fashioned not after anie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne shewed of God, but after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
<pb facs="tcp:12802:49"/>
and counsel of man. In which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie if our notable anguishe and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous grones were hearde in the eares of the Lorde, and in vs there were no want to call and stirre vp one another, and ioyne handes, for the helpe of the furtherance of the worke in bringing home the Arke of God: there were then greater hope of the daye wherein we might &amp; ought to reioyce, as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid here did.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, we note in Dauid, that his ioye was so great in the Lorde, that he conteyned not him selfe, but so leaped and daunced, that he seemed in the eyes of the wicked, as a foole, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vncouereth his shame, and become vile. For after that maner did <hi>Michal</hi> his wife reprochefullie taunte him,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.</note> as one whiche had so vily vncouered him self, that he should be a mocking stocke vnto the Maidens of Israel. But hee answered, that it was before the lord, who had performed vnto him so great mercie: for whose cause he woulde bee yet more vile and lowe in his owne sight. And saide moreouer, that of the
<pb facs="tcp:12802:50"/>
same Maidens whereof hee had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he should bee had in honour. Whereby we see, how litle he weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to become base and lowe in the sight of the worlde, so hee might sett foorth the glorie of the Lorde his God.</p>
            <p>At this day amongest vs, one of the greatest lettes &amp; hinderaunces of the Lordes worke finishing, is, for that it can not be done without the abasinge of the loftines of manie men whiche are exalted without the Lorde. As for the titles of Gracious and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lords, our Sauior Christ taught his Apostles that they might not bee amongest them. Therefore if these men so exalted, would loue and care for the Lords honour more then their owne, and would willinglie giue ouer their monstrous liuings, and all their worldlie pompe, though they thinke it were a great shame for them, and that they shoulde seeme vile before men, (whiche they ought willinglie to vndergoe,<note place="margin">

For of all the people in Englande whiche wayte for a more full appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of Gods glorie in his house, they shoulde be had in honour. Where as nowe contrariewise they receyue honour onelie of a fewe flattering ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge men, within their owne houses, whiche liue by bringinge dishes to their Table, and almost to all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the people of the lande, their name is in reproche, and they are become a Byworde and a common talke.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour Christ thought it no shame to abase him selfe to washe his Disciples feete: by that example,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.5.</note> and manie more teaching those which will followe him, that they must not thinke much to be baze and vile, and dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the sight of men, if they will looke for true honour in the sight of GOD. The Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> sayde vnto <hi>Zacharias,</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:12802:51"/>But what greatnes he had in the fight of the worlde, it appeareth, when as his clothing was of Camels heare, &amp; his meate was Locustes and wilde honie.

            <p>Our Sauior Christ who thought it no robberie, to be equal with God, he yet in his nature of man, became vile, and tooke vpon him the shape of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt: Hee turned his face to the stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: He humbled him selfe, euen to the death of the crosse.

For they shoulde stand as the faithfull witnesses in heauen, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes being registred in the booke of life.

            <p>Lastlie as touching Dauids affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ioye, and his delight which he hadd to see the glorie of God shine forthe: as it was declared by signes, yea the whole disposing of himselfe, to be great at that present time: so did
<pb facs="tcp:12802:53"/>
the continual practise of his life after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, giue token that it was intiere and vnfeined. For he continued his care and studie to be an instrument to aduaunce Gods glorie.</p>
            <p>Of our sone whote &amp; sone colde zeale: and of our gladnes, which bewraied it selfe to be more for the shining hope of our worldlie welfare, then for the hope of the increase of Gods kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the speedy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thereof: And of our loue, whiche haue giuen place to iniquitie soone getting the vpper hande: And of all our forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and goodnes, which appeared in the day, when the Lorde opened one dore for vs to come out of prison, and an other dore to haue entred his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, if we would haue but strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our selues a litle to haue remoued a fewe blockes in the waie: Of this our goodnes and forwardnes, howe that it proued but as a morning mist, which vanished before any heat of the Sunne brast forth: I haue spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Litle was that we had, therfore
<pb facs="tcp:12802:53"/>
was taken from vs euen that litle. Great was the true and sincere ioye, faith, zeale &amp; loue which Dauid hadd: therefore was giuen vnto him more. For he continued faithefull to him which hadd called him through grace, and for the remembrance of his great goodnes, he still in hart desired to add more labour vnto the Lords worke. For the Arke being brought home, &amp; placed in a tent, he desired to builde an house for the same. And if it hadd seemed good in the eyes of the Lord, to haue vsed his hande therin, as he did accept of his hart and goodwill: he woulde haue chose rather to haue bene destitute himselfe of a princelie pallace, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Arke of god should haue bene without a royall house, for the more manifestinge of the glorie thereof. And when he receyued an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, that he should not build an house vnto him, but his sonne shoulde builde it: yet as muche as he might, he did with all his power, and became a cheefe builder one waye,
<pb facs="tcp:12802:54"/>
when as an other waye hee could not, namelie, in preparinge those thinges which should furnishe the worke, and set it forwarde with speede, when it shoulde be begonne. For he said: My sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> is yonge and tender, and we must buylde an house for the Lorde,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 22.</note> magnificall, excellent, and of great fame and dignitie thoroughout all Countries. I will therefore nowe prepare for him. And hee prepared an hundred thousande Talentes of golde, and a thousande thousande Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes of Siluer: And of Brasse and of Iron, passinge weight: And also Tymber and Stones, and he had sett Masons to hewe and polish the stones in readinesse. And yet for all this, his hunger for Gods glorie, was not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but hee complayned that hee was able to doo no more. For hee sayde to his Sonne <hi>Salomon</hi>: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my pouertie I haue prepared these thinges.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There was then no necessitie of an house: For the Arke was kept in the
<pb facs="tcp:12802:54"/>
Tabernacle, whiche figured the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and that was after Gods institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the necessitie of hauinge the Temple came not vntill the Lords commaundement appointed a time therevnto. Neyther was there any ruine of thinges pertaining to Gods house at that time. Yet you see howe <hi>Dauid</hi> behaued himselfe, not constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any necessitie of the time, but inflamed by his true affection, which hungred for the further glorie of those things, which represented Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>There be witnesses in England, which know, howe that exceding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie mouthes of the teachers, and of those which speak as they are taught, haue confessed concerning their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: Some, that it is ruinous: Yet will they make the stones whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine out of the duste, not with a worke, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did with buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: but with a word or two, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is the churche of God yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12802:55"/>Some saye, It is naked, and yet a Churche: And thoughe it bee both hungrie and naked, they giue it such a beggars almes, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle Iames speake of: Goe warme thee, and fill thy bellie.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iames</hi> 2.16.</note> For they saye, God helpe it, wee shall praye for it. In the meane time nothinge is ministred to susteyne it with, touchinge that they complayne to bee wantinge vnto it, therefore what helpeth it?</p>
            <p>Some saye, It is as a man that wante a legge, and yet a church. But the Scripture saye, That that which is halting, is neare to bee turned out of the waye.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</note> Some saye, It want but an arme, &amp;c. But all this while they espie not wherein the greatest defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie lieth, namelie, In that it hath a little pretie bodie, and a great sorte of monstrous great heades. I meane those of whome wee maye well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne with the Prophete, and saye: O Christe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esai.</hi> 26.13.</note> Other Lordes besides thee haue ruled ouer vs.</p>
            <p>But because I knowe herein my ment
<pb facs="tcp:12802:55"/>
will be sifted: I saye for my selfe, that I iudge them not, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them. The worde of the Lorde iudgeth all them and mee.</p>
            <p>But concerninge the Churche of Englande, as they inticle it: It is a notable dishonour vnto Christ Iesus, to make all the Parishes in England generallie his Churche, hee will giue no thankes for that liberalitie. Yet I am perswaded (the Lorde I take to witnesse) that in the Realme of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande there bee diuers Churches. And I hope also that there bee manie more true worshippers, or such at the least as the Lorde doeth accept, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che abhorre and deteste to bowe the knee to the Antichristian scepter, more I saye, then seeme to appeare, as was in Israel in the dayes of the Prophete <hi>Eliah.</hi> But that the booke whiche is for Gods worshippe and seruice, and yet beareth not the name of God, that euer it caused Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to bee so framed, as that the Lord shoulde knowe it for his owne, I vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie
<pb facs="tcp:12802:56"/>
denie.</p>
            <p>But to returne to my purpose. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the case so standeth that the ruines and decayes of the Churches be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by a generall confession almoste of all: Yea seeing it is also confessed, that shee is sicke vnto death, and lie panting for breath: let vs not thinke, that sweete and smoothe wordes will heale her deadlie hurte, as to saye: yet it is a famous Churche, and other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions haue thought well &amp; reuerentlie of the Churche of Englande. &amp;c. But let all with whome is yet the feare of the liuinge GOD, and anie desire of his glorie, laye the hande to the worke, no more but euen thus, by es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing euill, and dooing good, that although they goe forwarde in fewe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, according to their pouertie for a tyme, yet by their example, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisementes, they maye winne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vnto righteousenesse, by callinge, and stirringe vppe after this maner: Come, lette vs goe vp to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Lorde,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esai.</hi> 2.3.</note> to the house of the
<pb facs="tcp:12802:56"/>
GOD of Iacob, and he shall teache vs his wayes, and wee will walke in his pathes.</p>
            <p>Let them also saye eche to other, that because we sought not the Lorde in dewe order, therefore heare we this complainte to our rebuke and shame: There was neuer more wickednes then is nowe.</p>
            <p>Thus if we do, labouring not more faintlie, because iniquitie hath gotten the vpper hande, but more valiaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to redeeme the times, because the dayes be euill, wee shall bee fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in the sight of the Lorde, accordinge to our abilitie, to haue polished &amp; made readie liuinge stones for the Lordes buyldinge, that although wee can see the worke goe but slowlie forwarde in our dayes, yet in the next generation it may rise more speedily to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of GOD. And let none vtter these wordes of vnfaythfulnes, Alas what can I doo, or what can twoo or three of vs doo, or howe are wee like to goe forwarde?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12802:57"/>So I maye saye, what can a graine of Mustarde seede doo? It is small to beholde. But beinge caste into the grounde in dewe time, and watered, wee see what it dooeth, and howe it spreadeth. So wee maye saye, what can wee doo, if wee sitte still? But if wee labour in the Lordes businesse, so as wee giue our selues ouer to bee sowne in the earth for his truethes sake, vndoubtedlie, out of oure dead bones or ashes there will springe vp manie more witnesses, vntill the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cause florishe gloriouslie.</p>
            <p>But to proceede.</p>
            <q>I reioyced when they sayde vnto mee. &amp;c.</q>
            <p>It is written in the Chronicles, that Dauid gathered all Israel togither,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Chro</hi> 15.</note> to goe vp to Ierusalem. And in that the people were so hartilie willinge, sayinge, That they woulde goe vp to the house of the Lorde, and their feete shoulde stande in the gates of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<pb facs="tcp:12802:57"/>
wee maye note this, that the Lorde nowe being with Dauid, after hee hadde feared before his face, and carefullie sought him in dewe order, hee addeth blessinge vnto blessing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to make his ioye full. For hee doeth not onelie make him to see the Arke come home in peace, but also giue him the hartes of all the people, as one man reioysinge with him, and praysing the Lorde, then the whiche nothing coulde refreshe and solace his minde more cherefullie ouer his grief paste.</p>
            <p>Thus doth the Lord make things to succeed with them (yea oftentimes more then they looke for) which seeke him in feare and tremblinge, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte to worke accordinge to his will.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when his harte had conceyued that enterprise of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the walles of Ierusalem, hee not onely obteyned leaue of the King to goe thither, whiche thing he hoped not for without feare: but also the
<pb facs="tcp:12802:58"/>
Lorde made him obtayne that whiche was least looked for, euen helpe and furniture of Timber towardes the worke. Moreouer, the Lorde gaue him the hartes of the people, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge their pouertie and few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yet were incouraged to worke with vnwonted forwardnesse.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Moses,</hi> though hee had a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde companie to guyde, yet when hee went about the Tabernacle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge, with all thinges apperteyning therevnto, accordinge to the Lordes commaundement, hee founde the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hartes so willinge and readie to offer, and their handes so full of giftes, that hee cryed, Ho, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to ceasse from offringe anie more.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 36.6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, let there be no vnchear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wordes amongest vs, to weaken our handes before we begin to worke. As some saye, Howe is it possible? Where shall wee haue fitte men for Elders? Where shall wee haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Ministers ynough? And where
<pb facs="tcp:12802:58"/>
shall we haue this and that?</p>
            <p>It is the propertie of a slouthfull seruaunt, to tell before hee goe out, howe hee is not like to speede. Let vs in the middest of all streightnes and impossibilities, take in hande our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise in the Lord with humblenes, wisedome, &amp; single hartednes: and we shal see successe not only in those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which we can foresee &amp; hope for: but also manie things vnlooked for of vs, shalbe prospered into our bosome.</p>
            <p>Nowe whereas the people speak so willingly, saying: We will go vp into the house of the lord: it declareth their forwardnes vnto a good enterprise. But the King had called them &amp; stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them vp therevnto. So peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it may seeme that the people are not to go vp into the Lordes house: es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie to go about such an heauenlie busines, as thei now did, without their Kings &amp; Princes going before them. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arke, though it bare a spiritu all representatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy things, yet it was a material thing, &amp; the bringing
<pb facs="tcp:12802:59"/>
of it home required outwarde furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and preparation accordinglie. But what the Priestes and people might haue done as touching it, if the King should haue bene to slacke: when I shall vnderstande it to bee doubted of: aunswere shall be made as GOD shall giue leaue.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, it is not amisse to speake some thinge of a question whiche flyeth much abroade, whiche haue bene taken vp rather of desire to intangle, then of anie loue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, as shoulde seeme by the disorderlie framinge and propoundinge thereof. The question is this:
<hi>Whither the Prince or the people ought first to beginne reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I aunswere with propoundinge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther questions. Can they tell whether Prince or people ought firste to turne to the Lorde? Whether Prince or people ought firste to do their duetie?
<pb facs="tcp:12802:59"/>
Or, whither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, the hand, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foot ought first to do that, which seuerallie appertaineth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of ech of those me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers to do? For Kings &amp; Princes ought to reform without delay or wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for other, so farr as the bounds of their calling reach: and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people they ought to reforme without al delaye or tarying for other, so farr as the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of their calling reach also. But howe farre the bounds of eche doo extende, therein lieth the chief point.</p>
            <p>In the name of God, let <hi>Caesar</hi> haue whatsoeuer vnto him belongeth, euen all ciuile power and Dominion or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned of God. And woe vnto him, saye I, whiche shall holde this, and teache men so, that there is no vse of the Magistrates sworde among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. For that is to remoue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doole of the great and large fielde which the Lorde haue measured out vnto them. And that is also to depriue Christians of that benefite of peace whiche the Lord haue ordayned that wee should enioye by their meanes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12802:60"/>For it is written: Exhort, that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2.</note> and Supplications be made for Kinges, and all that be in authoritie, that vnder them we may lead a godlie and peaceable life.</p>
            <p>Therefore I am thus perswaded, that as the Kinges of <hi>Iuda</hi> did refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me by their ciuile power, those things which outwardly were sett vp for abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations: namely, as they did break downe the altars, cutt downe the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, burne the images with fire, slaye the Preistes of <hi>Baal,</hi> and suche like thinges: So also it appertaineth to the Magistrates now, to break downe the idolatrous altars, plucke downe their buildinges, burne their images with fire, &amp; to slaye those, which haue reuolted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christianitie to open ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie. And herein wee prayse the Lorde, who strengthned our Princes handes, to worke so farre, as was wrought therin. And if our sinnes had not displeased the Lorde, we shoulde haue sene more.<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 13.18.</note> For I would to God the Arrow had not bene shott against

the ground only three times, but three hundred times three times, that a full conquest for euer might haue bin got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ouer those Antichristian <hi>Aramits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now concerning those abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which remaine, which part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I haue spoken of: As the offices, rowmes, and liuinges of the Lordlie ouerrulers of many churches, together with Deanes, &amp; Deanaries, Prebe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and Prebenshippes, Cathedralles w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Chaunters therin, and their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiden musick, Bishops Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celors, Archdeacons, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missaries, Proctors Officials, Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners &amp; Questmen, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che all do robbe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie &amp; libertie, and strippe her naked: These I say, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their Courtes &amp; Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawes, as also freehold Parsonages &amp; Uicariges, which hinder the free elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; deposing of the Minister: Also blind &amp; du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me ministers, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of stinted seruice to be read, being the staffe of strength of vpholding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: All these wormewoode dregges of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs cupp, &amp; whatsoeuer more, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth only to the office of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ciuile

to betraye the libertie &amp; authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which Christ haue left with vs to keepe, but to stand faste in the libertie wherein hee hath made vs free.

And this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of punishinge the transgressours by the Ecclesiasticall sworde, maye not be taken out of the Churches han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, neither can the Churche giue it ouer without denyinge Christe, who haue left this his power vnder their charge:<note place="margin">

            <p>Moreouer, it standeth with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the Lordes Congregation, to vse prayers and thankes giuing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, as the present occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>

for a newe graunt from men to doo our dueties in the true worshippe of God, when as we haue alreadie suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient graunt from heauen: we shall die in our sinnes, and our bloude shall be vpon our owne heades.</p>
            <p>Nowe, if the Ministers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples duetie and charge extende vnto this which I haue mentioned: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that nothing is wanting vnto true Churche gouuernement, but so much as the people, and especially the Ministers which shoulde guide them, are wanting vnto their duetie enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them by the Lorde.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in the Lorde, I doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire some of those Ministers in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande, whiche thinke hardlie of our doinges, and yet perswade them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues that they hartilie desire the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring of the Walles of Ierusalem: That they would set downe by proofe of the worde of God, that whiche is wanting to true &amp; full church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, besides that whiche is their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to doo, togither with their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,

whom they ought to stirre vp to their duetie likewise. If there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thinge at all: I will promise and vowe faythfullie to tarie and wayte w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them also. If there be nothing, why do they make so long suing at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; suffer so manie poore soules at home to be depriued of their heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie well fare, and to suffer sinne so too ouerspreade by their default, which by their keepinge the Lordes watche, might be cutt shorter? For what sewe they for vnto the Prince and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Euen for a lawe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pell them to doo that which the Lord haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to doo.
