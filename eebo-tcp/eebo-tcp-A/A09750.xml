         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

pastime, if you will; mirth, if you will;
gladnes, if you will; ioy, if you will:
but in Gods dictionarie it hath no
such name. In the holy Scripture, it is
otherwise called. It is called, Adams
goodly apple, which beeing eaten,
depriued him of Paradise; Esaus red
broth, which being supt vp, bereaued
him of his birthright; Ionathans
sweete honie-combe, which beeing
but tasted, was like to cost him his life;
the whore of Babylons golden cup,
which filled her full of all abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;

God forbid that I should delight

the world and all worldly delight, is

would handle a hedgehogge. The
safest way to handle a hedgehogge is
to take him by the heele. So must we
deale with this delight. As Iacob took
Esau that rough hedgehogge by the

Yea sure: doubt you not. It is possi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble

               </gap> with vs, when
we entertaine him, as Marie did, with
the salt teares of repentance &amp; griefe:
and as Lot did, with the sweete bread
of sinceritie, and truth. For the salt
teares of our repentance, are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drinke, which Christ will drinke
with vs. And the sweete bread of our
sinceritie, is the onely bread, which
Christ will eate with vs. But what
meate hath he to his bread? I haue a
meate (saies he) which you know not
of. My meate is to doe the will of him
that sent me. In the volume of thy
book it is written of me, that I should
doe thy will, O my God, it is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,

doe it. And as it is meate to him, to
doe it himselfe: so is it meate to him,
to see vas doe it. Then doth he suppe
with vs. And this is the first seruice.
But what hath he for a second course?

<hi>heart</hi> of man hath lost all rest; nay it
hath lost it selfe, before it be cast vpon

finde no rest for the sole of her foote,
all the while she was flickering ouer
the flond, till she returned to the arke,
with an oliue branch in her mouht: so
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19814:25"/>
the <hi>heart:</hi> of a christian, which is the
turtle doue of Christ, can find no rest
all the while it is houering ouer the
waters of this world, till it haue siluer
wings as a doue, and with the oliue
branch of faith, flie to the true Noah,
which signifieth rest, till Iesus Christ
put forth his holy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out of the arke,
and taking this heart into his hand,
receiue it to himselfe. Euen as one
good <hi>heart</hi> saies for all, I will not
climbe vp into my bedd, nor suffer
mine eies to sleepe, nor mine eielidds
to slumber, nor the temples of my
head to take their rest, vntill I find a
tabernacle for the Lord, an habitation
for the mightie God of<note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 132. 4.</note> Iacob. Vntill
I find, that my heart is not in mine
owne hand, but in Gods hand: vntill
I find, that God dwelleth in me, and
I in him: vntill I find, that my soule is
a tabernacle for the Lord, and my
<hi>heart</hi> is an habitation for the mighty
God of Iacob, I cannot rest, saies he.
But when I find this once: when I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19814:26"/>
come to Noah in the arke: when I
delight my selfe in the Lord; then I
will climbe vp into my bedd, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
mine eies to sleepe, and mine eie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liddes
to slumber, and the temples of
my head to take their rest. But whats
the reason of all this? I am somewhat
bold to aske, because I would be glad
to know: whats the reason I say, that
the bull, can neuer be quiet, till he
come to the staule; that the bucket,
can neuer be quiet, till it come to the
water; that the needle, can neuer be
quiet, till it come to the north poole;
that Ionas, can neuer be quiet, till he
come to the sea shore; that Nicaula,
can neuer be quiet, till she come to
Salomon; that Noahs doue, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be quiet, till it come to the arke;
that mans <hi>heart,</hi> can neuer be quiet,
till it come to God? The reason of it is
this. When God created heauen and
earth, he rested not in the heauen, or
in any heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly thing, not in the earth,
or in any earthly thing, but onely in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19814:26"/>
man, which is both. A heauenly thing
for his soule, and an earthly thing for
his bodie. As soone as he had made
man, he kept a sabboth, and rested.
Euen so the <hi>heart</hi> of man, resteth not
in the earth, or in any earthly thing,
not in the heauen, or in any heauenly
thing, but onely in God, which is
lord of both. Lord of heauen and
earth: Lord of soule and bodie. As
soone as it commeth to God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
in him, it keepeth holy-day,
and resteth. Gods heart neuer resteth,
till it come to man: mans heart neuer
resteth till it come to God. For as god
saies to man, My sonne giue me thy

after all his labour and paines. Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
hauing had a long time, tryall
of all transitorie pleasures, at length
frankly confessed, that they were so
farr from being a contentation to his
<hi>heart,</hi> that they were a very great vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
to his spirit. Nay Alexander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though he had conquered the whole

               </note>: yea in
the ende, he grew to be very male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
and found himselfe greatly
greiued, because there were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
many more worldes for him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19814:29"/>
to conquer. By which example of
Salomon and Alexander, (though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
a heathen,) it doth plainly
appeare, that if it had pleased God, to
haue created as many worlds, as there
are creatures in this one world, (which
he might haue done with the least
word of his mouth,) yet this infinite
number of worldes, which should
haue beene created, could not haue
filled the verie least <hi>heart,</hi> of any one
man, without the creatour himselfe.
This Orontius an excellent Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matitian
sheweth, who describing the
whole world in the forme of an <hi>heart,</hi>
leaueth many voide spaces in his heart
which he cannot fil vp with the world.
For as a circle, can neuer fill a triangle,
but alwaies there will be three empty
corners in the triangle vnfilled, if there
be nothing els to fill it, but the circle:
so the round world, which is a circle,
can neuer fill the heart of man, which
is a triangle, made according to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of the Trinity, but alwaies there
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19814:30"/>
will be some emptie corners, in the
triangle of the <hi>heart</hi> vnfilled, if there
be nothing els to fill it, but the circle
of the world. Onely the glorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,

as all the hearts of all the men, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

all the affections of all the angels, and

say that, which shall be yet much
more maruelous, if this one <hi>heart</hi>
were so great, that it could at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
actually containe in it, more
corporall and spirituall things, then
are in all the deepes beneath, in the
vallies, in the mountaines, and in all
the heauens aboue: yet as true as
God is in heauen, this so large, and so
huge a <hi>heart,</hi> could not be able to hold
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19814:30"/>
the very least part, of the perfection
of God; but if one droppe of his dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

Armenia, a noble ladie, beeing bidden
to king Cyrus wedding, went thither
with her husband. At night, when
they were returned home, her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
asked her, how shee liked the
bridegroo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, whither shee thought
him to be a faire and beautiful prince,
or no? Truth, saies shee, I know not.
For all the while I was forth, I cast
mine eyes vpon none other, but vpon
thy selfe. So basely did this noble la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
esteeme of king Cyrus beautie,
who was the Monarch of the world,
in respect of that entire good will and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19814:31"/>
affection, shee bare to her husband,
which was so great, that her eyes
could neuer be from him. And so
must we, set God alwaies before our
eyes, and not once looke aside, or be
enamoured with any gaud of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
glorie, but despise euery blaze of
beautie whatsoeuer, that may draw vs
from beholding our heauenly hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and <hi>delighting</hi> onely in him,
which is fairer then the children of
men. S. Paul beeing rapt vp to the
third heauen, knowes not, whither it
were with the bodie, or without the
bodie. And because we should marke
it well once, he sets it downe twise.
That he was rapt vp to the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
he is sure; that he heard words
which no man can vtter, he is sure;
that he was exceedingly delighted in
the Lord, he is sure. But whither his
bodie were with him or no, he knows
not. So much did he forget and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
euen his owne bodie, which is
so neere, and so deare a thing, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19814:32"/>
parison of that incomparable <hi>delight,</hi>
which then he tooke in the Lord. S.
Peter, seeing but a glimps of Christs
glorie, vpon mount Tabor, stood so
astonished and amazed with it, that
he was in a sort beside himselfe, when
he was at that time beside Christ.
Master, saies he, it is good for vs to be
here. As if he should haue said, Nowe
farewell Galilie, and all my goods:
farewell fellow Disciples, and all my
friends: farewell wife, &amp; all the world:
so I may inioy this heauenly sight, and
be continually thus <hi>delighted</hi> in the
Lord. Holy Ignatius, going to his
martyrdome, was so strangely rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this delight, that he burst out
into these wordes, Nay, come fires;
come beasts: come breaking of all my
bones: come racking of my whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
come all the torments of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
togither vpon me: come what can

so that I may inioy Iesus
Christ, and may be continually <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted</hi>
in the Lord. And so must thou
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19814:32"/>
(deare brother) insult ouer all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and exsult only in thy creatour.
Thou must contemne all beautie, as
Armenia did: yea thine owne bodie,
as Paul did: yea all the world as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
did: yea thy very life, as Ignatius
did: and be content to doe any thing,
though it were to be torne and pulled
in a thousand peeces: or for a time, if
it were possible, to suffer al the paines
which the fiends and furies of hell can
inflict vpon thee, so as in the end, thou
maiest <hi>delight,</hi> either the Lord in thy
selfe, or <hi>thy selfe in the Lord.</hi> Then,
then <hi>He shall giue thee:</hi> and not, He
shall giue thee onely, but <hi>The desires,</hi>
also: and not The desires onely, but
<hi>Of thy heart,</hi> also. <hi>Then he shall giue
thee the desires of thy heart.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
I say, <hi>He shall giue thee:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
I say, <hi>The desires:</hi> and againe I
say, <hi>Of thy heart. Then he shall giue thee
the desires of thy heart.</hi> Then, though
thou haue a long time plaied the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift,
and wasted all thy goods in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19814:33"/>
world: yet, if with the lost childe, thou
returne home againe, to thy fathers
house, he shall graunt thee thy <hi>hearts</hi>
desire, and receiue thee with minstrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and dauncing, and all manner of
festiuall ioy, and that plentie of bread,
which nourisheth euery hired seruant
in his house, shall much more feede
thee, which art his louing child, vnto
euerlasting life. Then, though all the
leekes and onyons of Egypt, which is
the world, haue failed thee: yet, if with
Israel, thou depend onely vpon God,
he shall distill the dewe of his grace,
into thy <hi>heart,</hi> and lay aside a chosen
raine for thee, and cause thee to
drinke of the sweete christall streams
of his pleasure, and giue thee to eate
of that hidden and heauenly Manna,
which no man knoweth, but he that
receiueth it. Then, though all the
clothes and couerings in the world,
cannot keepe thee warme; yet, if with
Dauid, thou be a man according to
Gods owne heart, he shall send thee
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19814:33"/>
that mysticall Abishag, which shall
comfort thy <hi>heart,</hi> and make thee hot
and feruent in spirit, which shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
thy strength and make thee yong
againe, and lustie as an Eagle. Then,
though thou haue a long time lost thy
labour, in seruing Laban, which is the
world: yet, if with Iacob thou returne
home againe to thy fathers house, god
shall meete thee by the way, and, as
the Prophet Osey speaketh, he shall
allure thee as thy paramour, and lead
thee into the wildernesse, and there
speake according to thine own <hi>heart,</hi>
friendly, and louingly vnto thee. And,
euen as louers, are oftentimes dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for the nonce, to take a fall of one
another, the stronger of the weaker:
so God shall wrestle a fall with thee,
as he did with Iacob, and yeeld so
much in loue to thee, as that he shall
suffer thee to giue him the fall, and to
preuaile against him. Iesus: what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
loue is this? why are we not
euen nowe, in the name of God, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19814:34"/>
with the loue of God: and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rauished with delight in the Lord?
At least wise I maruell, what a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife
many base minded world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
meane, that they had rather feed
vpon the huskes of hogges, then the
bread of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? that they had rather eate,
the ony ons of Egipt, then the manna
of heauen? that they had rather lie
acold, frozen and shiuering in sinne,
then be reuiued and cherished by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishag?
that they had rather take vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
paine, to serue Laban,
then take vnspeakeable pleasure, to
serue God? Fy vpon it: what a vile
folly is this? what a starke madnes is
this? what is this els, but to be euen bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
tormented, whereas they might
be most spiritually delighted? what is
this els, but to goe out of one hell, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another hell, where as they might
goe out of one heauen into another
heauen? For, why do you (beloued)
why doe you tell me so much, of I
know not what: of a worme, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19814:34"/>
dieth? of a fire, that neuer is quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
of a lake, that burneth with brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone?
of weeping, and gnashing of
teeth? Thus I tell you (good christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
and I tell you truly, and God in
heauen heares what I say, though you
heare me not; I tell you as loud as euer
I can; that, to serue sinne so slauishly:
to please the deuill so wretchedly: to
delight in the word so brutishly, as
many men doe: this is worse then all
wormes: worse then all fires: worse
then all lakes: worse then all weeping:
worse then hell it selfe. Whereas, on
the other side, to serue God, to please
God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to delight in God, to reioyce &amp;
solace thy soule in the Lord, which
hath alwaies giuen thee, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
giue thee, the desires of thy
heart; this is better then all treasures:
better then all crownes: better then all
kingdomes: better then all immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie:
better then heauen it selfe. This,
this it is, which shall bring thee, out of
one paradise, into another paradise.</p>
