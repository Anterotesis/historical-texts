            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Milius Macedonicus (Right
honorable) thinking to gratifie
Alexander the great with some
curious peece of workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ship,
waded so far in the depth of his
art, as strayning curtesie with
cunning, he skipt beyonde his
skill, not being able to make it
perfect. Who being blamed of Pausanias, for striuing
further then his sleeue would stretch, answeared: that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
arte and skill were wanting to beautifie the
work, yet heart &amp; wil did polish that part, which lacke
of cunning had lefte vnperfect, ouershadowing the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
of disabilitie, with the vaile of sincere affection.
Whose aunsweare, as one guiltie of the like crime, I
clayme for a sufficient excuse of my follie, that durst en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise
to striue beyond my strength, knowing my selfe
vnable, both by nature and art, to bring such a weighty
matter to a wise end. For if the fouler is to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned
of follie, that takes in hande to talke of hunting; or the
merchant counted as madde, which medleth with the
rules of Astronomie: then may I well be dubbed a dolt,
which dare take in hand to discipher the substaunce of
loue, that am but a lout; or to shew the force of fancie,
which am but a foole. But as there is not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cooling carde to a rash wit then want, so there is not
a more speedie spurre to a willing minde, then the force
of duetie: which droue me into a double doubt: eyther
<pb facs="tcp:20420:3"/>
to be counted as bold as blind Bayard, in presuming too
farre; or to incurre the preiudice of ingratitude, in being
too slacke; to bee thought vaineglorious in writing
without wit; or a thanklesse person forgetting my debt:
so hauing free choyse of them both, I thought it but a
light matter to bee counted ouer venturous, if I might
doe any thing which should shew some part of my due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
vnto your honour: neyther did I euer care to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
bolde, if that blemishe might eyther pleasure your
Lordship, or els make manifest my good will, whiche
alwaies did wishe to be with the formost of your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers.
But as wishes are of no value, so his will is as
vaine, that couetes to pay his debt with a counterfeite
coyne: wherein I both finde the fault, and commit the
offence. For being greatly indebted to your honour by
duetie, for the first payment I offer a peece of work nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worth the wetting nor wearing, the receiuing nor
reading, more meete for the Apothecaries pots, then a
noble mans hand; fitter for the pedler to rent, then Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
to reade. Yet if the worke be weighed with my
simple wit, it is downe measure; and if my good will
might serue for a weight, although the stuffe bee light,
yet there are few woulde be heauier in the ballance. So
that hoping of your honours wonted curtesie, that you
will marke the mynd, and not the matter; the will, and
not the worke; I commit your honour to the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>

            <p>AFter that, Gentlemen, I had neither wel furnished nor finished
this imperfect peece of woorke, but brought it to a bare ende,
whether it were for imitation or art, I haue almost forgot, but for
one it was, I chanced to reade diuers Epistles of sundrie men writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to the readers, wherin I found the best learned of them also far
drenched in doubt of their disabilitie, &amp; almost fortified for feare
that want of skill shoulde be a blemish to their woorke, as (thinking
a flat confession should haue a plaine pardon) they cal their bookes
vanities, shadowes imperfect paterns, more meete for the Pedler
then the Printer, toyes, trifles, trash, trinkets. Some comparing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to cheeses, neither worth the tasting, nor eating, so their books, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worth the reading nor hearing: and yet the worst of them all
so perfectly polished with the pumice stone of eloquence, as in them
nature and art doe striue for supremacie. If then those learned
men doe count their works but counterfeit, that were carued with
such curious cunning, and tearmed them trash which were Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
ware: what shall I call mine, which is of such simple stuffe, as
it is neither worth the cheaping nor chaunging? Surely I wil leaue
the name to the readers gentle iudgement, because I cannot finde
one bad enough, that euery one may tearme it as their fancy lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them. For there is no chaffer so charie, but some will cheape;
no ware so bad, but some wil buy; no booke so yll but some will both
reade it and praise it; &amp; none againe so curious, but some wil carpe
at it. Wel, so many heades, so many wittes. If Gentlemen will take
my booke as a toy to passe away the time, and weigh mere of my
meaning then of the matter, and more of my wil, then eyther of my
wit, or the worke; if I say, they shall shew me this curtesie, it shal be
both a spurre to prick me forward to attempt further, and a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

the pollitique wisdome of the wise Rular. Out of whose

whome fortune did not onely endue with wealth, but also beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with as great wisdome, as any of his predecessors: so that
it was in doubt, whether he wanne more fauour for his wit, or
feare for his ryches: whether hee were better lyked for his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or loued for his courtesie: but sure whether it were, he had
gayned the hearres of all the people. And yet for all these gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
giftes of Nature, he was more bound vnto Fortune, which
had bestowed vpon him one onely daughter, called <hi>Mamillia,</hi> of
such exquisit perfection and singular beautie, as the lineaments
of her body, so perfectly portrayed out by nature, did shew this
gorgeous Goddesse to be framed by the common consent of all
the Graces: or els to purchase Nature some great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by caruing a peece of so curious perfection. For her body
was not onely beautified with the outward blaze of beautie: but
her minde was also endued with the beames of inward bountie,
as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men were rauished as much with the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of her wisdom,

as driuen into admiration with the fourme of her feature. But
what neede I to disciphet her excellent perfection, sith nature
had so cunningly paynted out the portraiture, both of her mind
and body, in such comly coulours, as it may suffice for me to say,
she was the flower of all <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This gallant Gyrle by her vertuous qualities had made
such a stealth in the heart of one <hi>Florion,</hi> a young Gentleman,
which serued as she did in the Dukes court at <hi>Venice,</hi> that hee
reposed his onely pleasure in her presence, and againe her onely
contentation consisted in his company, that they were two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
and one soule, their will and wish was alike, the consent of
the one was a constraint to the other, the desire of <hi>Mamillia,</hi>
was the delight of <hi>Florion:</hi> yea the concord of their nature was
such, as no soppes of suspition, no mistes of distrust, no floddes
of ficklenes could once foyle their fayth, their friendship was so
firmely founded on the rocke of vertue: for this straight league

Whereby we may well note the broad blasphemy of those
which thinke, because the Towe cannot touch the fire, but it

but it must flame, nor the Uine branch embrace the tender twig,
but it must consume it: that loue and lyking cannot be without

               </gap>iousnes: that deepe desire cannot be without flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affection: but this suspition proceedeth of an eull disposition.
This currish misconstruing commeth of a corrupt conscience,
they seeke others, where they haue beene hidde them selues: for
we may see by experience and manifest examples, that there
haue beene euen lewd Louers, which haue contented their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
desire, onely with the courteous countenaunce of their
Mistresse, who although they were caught in the snare of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and altogether vowed vnto vanitie, yet they could so well
bridle their affections, that the onely sight of their Ladye was
sufficient to feed their fancy. If then the wanton woer, whose
stay is but a rotten staffe, can so valiantly resist the Alarmes of
lust; may not a faythfull friende frie in friendship, and freese
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20420:5"/>
in such filthy affection, be feruent in goodnesse, and cold in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire?
yes <hi>Amian</hi> and <hi>Ignatia: Auficlius</hi> and <hi>Canchia: Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
and his <hi>Florinda,</hi> are sufficient proofes and presidences of
this chast league of loyall amitie, that we may well thinke, and

and <hi>Mamillia</hi> was altogether founded vpon vertue, and the

litle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancy in such kites of <hi>Cressids</hi> kind, whose minds were
as foule within, as their faces faire without: he had been burnt
in the hand, for touching fire without aduisement: he had late e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
tasted of that baite, to bee taken in the trappe: he had bin
too sore canuased in the Nettes, to strike at euery stale: and hee
had trusted too much the shape of the body, to be so soone allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ewe of Beawtie: yea hee had beene so deepelye
drenched in the waues of womens wyles, that euery sodayne
sight was a sea of suspition, as he made a vowe in the waye of
martage to abandon the company of women for euer, and to a
solemne oath, since he had wonne againe the fieldes of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
neuer by the leawdnes of loue to enter into bondage. Yet
he would not altogether, (although hee had cause with <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
to proclaime himselfe open enemie to womankinde) seeme
so absurd a Sophister, to inferre a general conclusion of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
proposition, nor be counted so iniurious, to condemne al
of lightnesse, for ones leawdnes; nor to shewe himselfe such a
moodelesse <hi>Aminius,</hi> to say all were Criples, because he found
one halting: No, no, he knew all hearbes were not as bitter as
<hi>Coloquintida;</hi> that all water was not infectious, though some
were pestilent; that as there is a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gable <hi>Polipe,</hi> so there is a

a fleeting <hi>Phania;</hi> and as vertuous a <hi>Mamillia,</hi> as a vicious
<hi>Luminia:</hi> so that as he detested y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one for her folly, he imbraced
the other for her vertue: insomuch that hauing himself escaped
the seas of trouble and care, yet he thought his minde not fully
quiet, vntill he might cause his friend <hi>Mamillia,</hi> to cast her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb facs="tcp:20420:6"/>
in the port of Tranquilitie. For after that he had made a
<hi>Metamorphosis</hi> of himselfe from a Courtier of <hi>Venice,</hi> to a
Countriman in <hi>Sienna:</hi> from the waues of wickednes, to the
calme seas of Securitie: from the castle of Care, to the pallace
of pleasure: from the heath of Heauines, to the hauen of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
yea, as he thought, from hel to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet he could not haue a
quiet conscience, til he might see her of the same sect, &amp; as dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to hate it, as he did loth it: so that he wrot her a letter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he counsayled her to follow his example, which shee hauing
receiued, and read, the force of his friendshippe, on the one side
so perswaded her, &amp; the rule of reason on the other side, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned
her, that she concluded to abandon the Dukes Courte
for euer, and so eschewe the bayte wherein was hidde such a
deadly hooke, to abstaine from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pleasure, which in time would
turne to poyson, to giue a final farewell to that condition of life,
which at length woulde breede her confusion. And therefore
hauing obtayned leaue of the Dutches, came home in haste to
her fathers house in <hi>Padua,</hi> where she had not remayned long,
beefore diuers young Gentlemen drawen by the passing prayse
of her perfection, which was bruted abroade through al the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
repayred thither all in general, hoping to get the goale, &amp;
euery one particularly perswading himself to haue as much as
any, wherwith to deserue her loue: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was no Feather,
no fangle, Gem nor Iewell, Ouch nor Ring left behinde, which
might make them seemely in her sight: yea some were so curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
no doubt, as many Italian Gentlemen are, which woulde
euen correct nature, where they thought shee was faultie in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
For their narrow shoulders must haue a quilted Dublet
of a large sise: their thinne belly must haue a coat of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
cut: their crooked legges, a fide sloppe; their smal shankes,
a bombast hose, and their dissembling mind, two faces in a hood:
to wax with the Moone, and ebbe with the sea: to beare both fire
and water, to laugh and weepe all with one winde.</p>
            <p>NOwe amongst all this courtly crew, which resorted to the
house of <hi>Gonsaga,</hi> there was a Gentleman, called <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:20420:6"/>
a youth of wonderfull witte, and no lesse wealth, whome
both nature and experience had taught the old prouerbe, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as his <hi>Pater noster,</hi> he that cannot dissemble, cannot lyue:
which sentence is so surely setled in the mindes of men, as it
may very wel be called in question, whether it belong vnto them
as an inseperable accident, or els is engrafted by nature, and so
fast bred by the bone, as it will neuer out: for they will haue the
cloath to be good, though the lyning be rotten ragges; and a
fine die, though a course thread: their wordes must be as smooth
as oyle, though their heartes be as rough as a rocke, and a smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
countenaunce in a frowning minde. This <hi>Pharicles,</hi> I
say, fayre enough: but not faythful enough, a disease in men, I
will not say incurable, crauing altogether to croppe the buddes
of her outward beawtie, and not the fruites of her inward boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
forced rather by the lust of the body, then enticed by the loue
of her vertue; thought by the glose of his painted shew, to win
the substance of her perfect minde, vnder his side cloathes to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his clawes, with the cloake of curtesie to conceale his curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ositie.
For as the birdes cannot be enticed to the trappe, but by
a stale of the same kind, so he knew well enough, that she, whose
minde was surely defenced with the rampire of honestie, must
of necessitie haue the onset giuen by ciuilitie. He therefore fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a sheepes skin for his woolues backe, and putting on a
smooth hide ouer his Panthers panch, vsed first a great grauitie
in his apparell, and no lesse demurenes in his countenaunce and
gesture, with such a ciuil gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his affection, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
rather to court vnto <hi>Diana,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vow his seruice vnto <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
This Gentleman being thus set in order, wanted nothing
but opportunitie to reueale his minde to his new Mistresse, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that if time would minister place and occasion, he would
so reclaime her with his faigned eloquence, as she should sease
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his lure, &amp; so cunningly cloake her with his counterfeit cal,
as she should come to his fist: for he thought himselfe not to haue
on al his armour, vnlesse he had teares at command, sighes, sobs,
prayers, protestations, vowes, pilgrimages, and a thousand false
othes to bind euery promise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20420:7"/>
While thus he made his traine, <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> as his custome
was, once a yeere inuited all the youth of <hi>Padua</hi> to a banquet,
where, after they had taken repast, there was no talke but of the
beawtie of <hi>Mamillia,</hi> vntill euerye man tooke his Mistresse to
tread the measures.</p>
            <p>But shee knowing idlenesse to bee the nource of Loue,
and thinking him halfe madde, who fearing fire, woulde
put towe into the flame; or that doubting of drowning, would
swimme in the Sea; conueied her selfe closely from that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
company alone into a garden, intending by solitarinesse to
auoyd al inconuenience, as her presence among the lustie brutes
might haue procured. <hi>Pharicles,</hi> who now thought tyme and
place conuenient to discouer his minde, sat quite beside the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle:
for perceiuiug the absence of his Mistresse, his heart was
in his hose, and he stoode, as if he had with <hi>Medusas</hi> head beene
turned to a stone. Thus nypped on the pate with this newe
mischaunce, he determined to returne home in hast to bewayle
his happe: but as nothing violent is permanent, so his sodaine
sore had a new salue. For as hee passed through the court, he
espied <hi>Mamillia,</hi> reading alone in the garden, whose sodaine
sight so reuiued his daunted mind, as that he paced vnto her, and
after he had curteously giuen her the <hi>Salue,</hi> interrupted her on
tis manner.</p>
            <p>Mistresse <hi>Mamillia,</hi> although my rashnes merit blame, in
presuming so farre to trouble your studye, yet the cause of my
boldnes deserueth pardon, sith it commeth of goodwill and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
For where the offence proceedeth of loue, there the
pardon ensueth of course: But if you thinke the faulte so
great, as remission cannot so easilye be graunted, I am heere
willing, that the heart which committed the cryme, shall suffer
the punishment due, and yeelde to bee your slaue for euer,
to kneele at your Shryne as a true seruaunt in parte of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mamillia</hi> hearinge the Gentlemanne in suche tearmes,
although somewhat abashed, payde him his debte in the same
coyne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:20420:7"/>
Maister <hi>Pharicles,</hi> although your sodaine ariuall did not
greatly hinder my study, I thinke it did not greatly profit your
selfe: so that your absence might haue more pleasured you, and
better contented me. And where you say the offence proceedeth
of good will and affection, I am not so madde to thinke, that
the hearb <hi>Sisimbrium</hi> wil sprout and sprigg to a great branch
in a momente: that the colde yron will burne at the sight
of the fire: but hee that will iuggle must playe his feates
vnder the boorde, or els his halting will be spied. And where in
recompence of your fault, you proffer your seruice, I will haue
no Gentlemen my seruaunts, vnlesse for their Liuery, I should
giue them a chaungeable suite: and therefore if your market be
ended, and your deuotion done, you haue as good leaue to goe,
as to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharicles</hi> perceiuing the frumpe, as one that was maister of
his occupation, serued her againe of the same sauce.</p>
            <p>Gentlewoman, in that my ariual did not greatly hinder your
Muses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I thinke my fault so much the lesse: although procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of your curtesie, rather then of my good happe: but if I
had knowne my absence might haue pleasured you, my presence
should not haue troubled your patience: and though the hearbe
<hi>Sisimbrium</hi> growes not to a great braunch in a moment, yet
the tallest blade of <hi>Spattania</hi> hath his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and if the Iron burneth not at the sight of the fire, yet the harde
stone <hi>Calcir,</hi> which can be bruised with no mettall, melteth with
the heate of the Sunne, and is resolued into licour. As for my
iuggling, if it may be spyed, it argueth the more good will, and
lesse deceite: so that if I halte, I am a starke lame Lazar, and
not a counterfeit Criple. For my Liuery, if I may be your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt,
I passe not what couler it be, so it commeth of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and not of my desert. Thus, as I haue nowe begunne
my market with buying my bondage, and selling my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
finding the ware I looked for, but the choyce so cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
that no price will bee sette, hoping the champion will in

my leaue.</p>

Yea but the Mariners sound at the first, for feare of a rocke: the

I haue heard them say, she that marries for beauty, for

shall finde him but a solemne Saint. Why? all <hi>Padua</hi> speakes
of his honestie, yea but perchance he makes a vertue of his need,
<pb facs="tcp:20420:9"/>
and so layes this baulmed hooke of fayned honesty, as a luring
bayte to trappe some simple Dame. Why? can he be faithlesse
to one, that haue beene faithfull to all? The cloth is neuer tryed
till it come to the wearing: and the linnen neuer shrinkes, till
it comes to the wetting: so want of liberty to vse his will, may
make a restraint of his nature: and though hee vse faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie
to make his marriage, yet she perhaps that shall try him,
shall either finde he neuer had them, or quite forgot them. For
the nature of men as I haue heard say, is like the Amber stone,
which will burne outwardly, and freese inwardly: and like the
Barke of the Myrtle tree, which growes in the mountaynes in
<hi>Armenia,</hi> that is, as hot as fire in the tast, and as colde as water

barke: the <hi>Onix</hi> is hottest when it lookes white, the Sirens
meane most mischiefe, when they sing: the Tyger then hideth

Therefore keepe the memory of <hi>Pharicles</hi> as needful, and

loue; and loue when thou hast tried him loyall: vntill then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

            <p>When <hi>Mamillia</hi> had vttered these worde, she went out of the
garden priuily into her closet, and there to auoyde the inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
which might haue ensued of those foolish cogitations, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an old Gentlewoman, which was her nurse named Madam
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20420:9"/>
               <hi>Castilla,</hi> to beare her company: a Gentlewoman, whose life and
yeeres were so correspondent, as for her honestie shee might
haue tryed the daunger of <hi>Dianas</hi> caue: So they two together
passe the time in honest and mery talke, vntill all the guestes of
<hi>Gonzaga</hi> had taken their leaue, and departed.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Pharicles,</hi> who all this while had a flea in his eare, &amp; his
combe cut with the taunting quippes of his Mistresse, as his
fire was the more, his flame was the greater, and not being able
so well to rule his lust, as she to bridle her loue, vsed himself for
a secretarie, with whome to participate his passions, knowing
that it were a poynt of meere folly to trust a friend in loue, sith
<hi>Ouid</hi> in his booke <hi>de Arte amand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and perceiuing very wel, that in such matters two might

tearmes with himselfe.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Pharicles, Pharicles,</hi> now thou findest it true, which earst
thou countest for a fable, that so long the Flie dalies in the flame
that at length she is burnt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the birdes <hi>Halciones</hi> ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter so long
in the waues, that at last they are drowned; that so longe the
pitcher goeth to the brooke, as in tyme it comes broken home:
so thou which warming thy fancy at euery flame, and ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thy selfe at euery waue, art at last burnt with beawtie,
and drowning in desire, as it standes in hazard, that either thou
returne home broken, or halfe crased. Nowe thou seest
venturing, if it bee token of witte, yet is it no signe of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and that timiditie in loue is a vertue. Nowe hast
thou founde <hi>Phocas</hi> precept to bee fruitefull, that a Louer
shoulde proceede in his suite, as the Crabbe, whose pace is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
backwarde, that though loue bee like the Adamant, which
hath vertue to draw: yet thou shouldest be sprinckled with goats
blood, which resisteth his operation: that though the face of
some fayre dame hath power to incense thy minde, yet thou
shouldest take the hearb <hi>Lupinar</hi> to coole desire. But <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles,</hi>
if thou beest taken, it is no meruaile, if thou beest hurt, it
is no pittie: for the Minow that is euer nibbling, and neuer by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
will at length be hanged on the hooke. Thou which didst
<pb facs="tcp:20420:10"/>
accuse so currishly all women of lightnes in loue, shalt perhaps
now condemne thy selfe of leawdnes in lyfe: and thou which in
thy choyce wert counted captious, shalt try thy selfe not to be
so curious. What Gentlewoman in all <hi>Padua</hi> was there ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so fayre or honest, whose beautie or vertue thou didst not
deeme light, esteeming them eyther vnmeete for thee, or thy
selfe vnfitte for them: so that eyther thou couldest sooth her with
a trumpe, or els lay a loading carde on her backe, should wey a
scoffe? and nowe thou art like to be serued of the same sauce:
which, if it happen, those whome you vsed for a sporte, will
eyther thinke thou didst not know thy descant, or els crosse thee
for a foole. Why, <hi>Pharicles?</hi> wilt thou be a preacher? who
is so guiltie as he that accuseth himselfe? if thou hast commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the crime, yet let an other finde the faulte. It is a fowle
birde defiles the own neast, construe al thinges to the best, turne
the stearne the best waye: yea, and if thou haste troden thy
shooe awry, it is but a poynt of youth, leaue such foolish exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of thy crased conscience. <hi>Mamillia,</hi> yea <hi>Mamillia, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi>
is the marke thou must shoote at: her beautie is the goale
thou must seeke to get: her fayre face, her golden lockes her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
cheekes: to conclude, her christall corps shadowed ouer with
a heauenly glasse: surpassing beautie is the Syren, whose songe
hath enchanted thee, and the <hi>Circes</hi> cuppe, which hath so sotted
thy senses, as either thou must with <hi>Vlysses</hi> haue a speedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie,
or els remayne transformed. She hath the power to bynd
and loose: her comelinesse is the comfortable collise to cure thy
care, her perfection is the lenitiue plaister, must mitigate thy
payne: her beauty is like the hearbe <hi>Phanaces,</hi> whiche reuiueth
the dead carcasse. Ah <hi>Pharicles</hi> is the foundation of thy faith fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon her feature? consider with thy selfe, beauty is but a blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
whose flower is nipped with euery frost, it is like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grasse
in <hi>India,</hi> which is withered before it springeth: what is more
fayre? yet what more fading? What more delighthfull, yet
nothing more deadlye? what more pleasaunte? and what more
perillous? Beautie may wel be compared to the Bathes in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licut,</hi>
whose streames flow as cleere as the floods of <hi>Padus,</hi> and
whose operation is as pestilent as the riuer <hi>Orme.</hi> What <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:20420:10"/>
wilt thou become a precise <hi>Pythagoras</hi> in renouncing
of loue, or a teastie <hi>Tianeus</hi> in dispraysing of beauty? What
more cleere then the Cristall? and what more precious? What
more comely then cloth of Arras? so what more coastly? what
creature so beautifull as a woman, and what more estimable? is
not the Diamond of greatest dignity, that is most glistering?
and the pearle thought most precious, that is most perfect in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour?
<hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, he cannot be counted happy, although hee
had al the vertues, if he want beauty: yea <hi>Appollonius</hi> an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heretike,
and professed enemie against the sacred lawes of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is driuen both by the lawes of nature and nurture, to confesse
that vertue is so much the more acceptable, by howe muche the
more it is placed in a beautifull body. Therefore <hi>Pharicles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
as perceiuing thine owne folly, and make amends to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as guilty of blasphemy: for by dispraise thou shalte reape re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
and by praise in hazard to atchieue thy purpose. <hi>Cineas</hi>
the Philosopher was of this opinion, that when the Gods fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
beauty, they went beyond their skill, in that the maker was
subiect to the thing made: for none so wise, but beauty hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched:
none so sober but beauty hath besotted: none so valiant,
but beauty hath byn victor: yea euen the Gods themselues haue
geuen beauty the superiority as a thing of more force then they
were able to resist.</p>
            <p>Well <hi>Pharicles,</hi> sith beauty is the price for which thou mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to venture, vse no delay, for feare of danger: let no fonde rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
perswade thy setled minde, let not the preceptes of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
subuert the will of nature, youth must haue his course, hee
that will not loue when he is young, shal not be loued when he
is olde. Spare no cost, nor be not afrayde of words: for they are
as winde, they which are most coy at the first, are most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant at
the last. What a cold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fect had the Lord <hi>Mendozza,</hi> at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Sauoyes</hi> hand? <hi>Prictor</hi> at his <hi>Coluida,</hi> &amp; <hi>Horatius</hi> at
his <hi>Curiatia?</hi> So though <hi>Mamillia</hi> were something short in her
answeres, it signifieth the greater affection, though she made it
strange at the first, she wil not be strait at the last: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greatest offer
<pb facs="tcp:20420:11"/>
hath but a small denyall. Well, to conclude, I am fully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in my selfe, eyther to winne the spurres, or loose the horse:
to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blossome, or lose y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruite: to enioy the beautie of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millia,</hi>
or els to ieopard a ioynt. And therefore whatsoeuer lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
willes, I will consent vnto Nature: for the best clarkes
are not euer the wisest men: whatsoeuer the lawes of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
perswade me, I will at this time giue the raynes of libertie
to my amorous passions: for he that makes curiositie in loue, wil
so long straine curtesie, that either he wil be counted a solemne
sutor, or a witlesse wooer: therefore whatsoeuer the chaunce be,
I wil cast at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharicles</hi> hauing thus made an end, stood in a mase with him
selfe, not that it did proceede from any sincere affection, enforced
by her vertue: but that his mind was set vpon lust, enflamed by
her bewtie.</p>
            <p>Which disease I doubt nowadayes reignes in many <hi>Italian</hi>
gentlemen. Whether it be that <hi>Mercurie</hi> is Lord of their birth,
or some other peeuish planet predominant in the calculation of
their natiuitie, I know not: but this I am sure, that theyr rype
wittes are so soone ouershadowed with vice, and their senses so
blinded with self loue, that they make their choyce so farre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
skill, as they proue them selues but euill chapmen: for if she
be faire, they thinke her faithfull: if her bodye be endued with
bewtie, they iudge she cannot but be vertuous. They are so bli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the visor of <hi>Venus</hi> and conceite of <hi>Cupid,</hi> as they
think all birdes with white fethers to be simple Doues: euery
seemely <hi>Sappho,</hi> to be a ciuill <hi>Salona:</hi> euery <hi>Lais,</hi> to bee a loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<hi>Lucrece:</hi> euery chatting mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be a chast matrone. These
are such as chose for lust, and not for loue; as marry the bodye,
and not the mind: so that as soone as the beautie fo their Mistres
be vaded, their loue is also quight extinguished. But againe to
the purpose.</p>
            <p>As thus, I say, <hi>Pharicles</hi> had well eased his minde with this
last meditation, because his loue was but a lose kind of likinge,
and the fire of his fancie such a flender flame, as the least misly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
showre of shrewd fortune would quite quench it: therfore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20420:11"/>
he had neither care of his choyce, nor feare of his chaunge: but
onely fed his fancy with the hope of hauing <hi>Mamillia:</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
vpon this poynt, till eyther occasion or place should serue to
offer his seruice.</p>
            <p>In the meane time <hi>Gonzaga</hi> perceiuing his daughter to be
mariageable, knowing by skill and experience, that the grasse
being ready for the sieth, would wither if it were not cut; and
the apples beeing rype, for want of plucking woulde rotte on
the tree; that his daughter beeing at the age of twentie yeeres,
would either fall into the greene sicknes for want of a husband,
or els if she scaped that disease, incurre a farther inconuenience:
so that lyke a wise father he thought to foresee such daungers.
And deuisinge with himselfe where hee might haue a meete
match for his Daughter, thought none so fit as <hi>Pharicles,</hi>
who I say by his crafty cloaking, had wonne the hearts of al the
Gentlemen of <hi>Padua.</hi> Therefore first intending to knowe
whether his Daughter could fancy the Gentleman, before hee
should breake the matter vnto him, &amp; yet if he doubting he should
moue the question, she might conceiue some hope of libertie, and
so strayne vpon her owne choyce, went vnto Madam <hi>Castilla</hi>
her nourse, desiring her to moue the motion to his daughter,
as concerning <hi>Pharicles,</hi> &amp; that the next day she should tell him
his aunswere. Madam <hi>Castilla</hi> easily graunted: and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> went vnto the chamber of <hi>Mamillia,</hi> where
she found her solemnly sitting in secrete meditation, vpon the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of a Letter, which not half an houre before was sent vnto

<pb facs="tcp:20420:12"/>
that my perswasions preuailed: and likewise iudging you to bee
wise, in that you both auoyd daunger, and prouide for a storme:
for it is a great vertue, saieth the Poet, to abstaine from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
The courtly life, saith <hi>Agrippa,</hi> is a glistering miserie:
for what more pleasaunt outwardly, and what more perilous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly?
what more delightful to the body? what more deadly to
the minde? there is the substance of vice, with the vaile of vertue,
there is bondage in the shape of licencious libertie, and care clad
in a masking coat. Happy, yea thrise happy art thou <hi>Mamillia,</hi>
whose wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e hath not bin inueigled by wit, nor whose wil hath
not bin enforced by wilfulnes: for in obeying the one, thou hast
scaped danger, &amp; in resisting of the other, thou hast won same.
Yea, but the gold, saith some, is tried in the fire, and the ore is
put into the furnace. It is more honour to keepe the forte being
assayled, then not besieged: so the credit of a Gentlewoman is
more, to be honest in the court, then in the countrey, and it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaseth
more fame to kneele with a chast minde at the shrine of
<hi>Venus,</hi> then at the altar of <hi>Vesta. Mamillia,</hi> so many heades, so

of <hi>Cupid:</hi> yea the vtter enimy to virginity: so that in as much as
virginity is to be esteemed, so much the Dukes court is to be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed.
But I heare thou art at home with thy father in <hi>Padua,</hi>
&amp; that there is great resort of Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to craue thee in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
take counsel, <hi>Mamillia,</hi> at him which hath bought it. If thou
hast taken care to keepe thy virginity inuiolable, as thy greatest
treasure: so take both heede and time in bestowing the same as a
most precious Iewel. Respect not his beauty, without vertue:
for it is like a ring in a swynes snoute: esteeme not his wealth
without wit, nor his riches without reason; for then thou shalt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
choose a fayre Inne with a foule hostesse; or wed thy self to a

woodden picture with a golden coate. Regarde not his byrth,
without bountie: for it wil euer procure statelinesse. Beware of

            <p>
               <hi>Florion, Mamillia,</hi> writeth to you of marriage, which if it
commeth of his owne coniecture, and no report, he proueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a subtill sophister, meaning vnder the colour of an vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
rumour, to perswade you to a most stayed and stedfast state
of life, as one knowing very well, that as nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
then virginitie: so nothing is more honourable than
matrimonie. And I my selfe, <hi>Mamillia,</hi> which once a wife, and
now a widdow, doe speake by experience, that though virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is pleasant, yet marriage is more delightfull. For in the first
creation of the world, God made not <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eua</hi> single vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
but ioyned couples: so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> virginitie is profitable to one, but
marriage is profitable to many. Whether is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vine more regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that beareth grapes, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ash that hath nothing but leaues?
The Deere that encreaseth the park, or the barren Doe? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the hoppe tree more esteemed, that rots on the grounde,
than that which clasping the pole, creepeth vp, &amp; bringeth foorth
fruite? What, <hi>Mamillia,</hi> as virginity is fayre and beautifull: so
what by course of kind is more vnseemely, then an old wrinckled
maide? what is more pleasaunt to the sight, then a Smaragde,
yet what lesse profitable, if it be not vsed? What more delightful
to the eyes, then the colour of good wine; yet what of lesse value
if it cannot be tasted? There is nothing more faire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix,</hi>
yet nothing lesse necessary, because she is single. Yea, euen
the law of nature, <hi>Mamillia,</hi> wisheth society, and detesteth soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarinesse.
Whether euen in thine owne iudgement, <hi>Mamillia,</hi>
if thou hadst a goodly orcharde, wouldest thou wish nothing but
blossomes to grow continually; or the blossomes to fade, and the
trees to be fraught with pleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fruit? Whether doest thou think
the ruddy Rose, which withereth in the hand of a man, deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
both sight and smelling, more happie than that which fadeth
on the stalke without profit? Whether hath the wine better luck
which is drunken, than that which standing still, is turned to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger?
<pb facs="tcp:20420:14"/>
And yet, <hi>Mamillia,</hi> I graunt too muche: for a womans
beauty decayes not with marriage, but rather commeth then to
the flower and perfection. But as I doe perswade thee to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
so would I wish thee to change for the better, or els keepe
thy chance still: I meane, I would haue him that shoulde match
with thee, to bee suche a one, in whose society thou shouldest not
count mariage a bondage, but a freedom; not a knot of restraint,
but a band of liberty, one whom thou shouldest like for his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and loue for his vertue; I would haue him to want no wealth,
and yet to be wise, and with his wisedome to haue all kynde of
ciuility.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Mamillia,</hi> as I haue spoken in general, so I wil touch
the particular. I meane to shew thereof one, which I woulde
wish to be thy husband, and thee to be his wife. <hi>Pharicles</hi> it is,
to be flat with thee, whose beauty &amp; honesty hath amased all <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
whose order of lyuing may be, and hath been a perfect plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
and methode of ciuil dealing, and honest behauiour: thee,
<hi>Mamillia,</hi> I wish to be his mate for his curtesie: and him to be
thy match but in constancie. The Gemme which is gallaunt in
colour, and perfect in vertue, is the more pretious; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hearbe,
which hath a faire bark, and a sweete sappe, is the more to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed;
the Panther with his paynted skin and his sweet breath
is the more delighted: so <hi>Pharicles</hi> faire in face, and faithfull in
his heart; pleasant in his countenance, and perfect in his mind;
is so much the more to be imbraced. If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ore, <hi>Mamillia,</hi> which
is drosse outwardly, and gold inwardly, be of great price: what
then is the pure mettal? if the rough stone with a secret vertue, is
of value: what is it then, being polished? If a smooth &amp; learned
style in an ill print, importes some credit: what doth that which
commeth out of a perfect presse? so <hi>Mamillia,</hi> if a man which is
deformed in body, and reformed in minde, may deserue great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
what deserues he, which is both bountifull, and beautiful?
If a crooked carkasse, and an honest nature merite commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
what doth he then, which is both faire &amp; faithful? If a disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
body, with honest conditions, wins fauour: what the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth
a comely cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, with a curteous mynd? Al these perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20420:14"/>
by nature, <hi>Mamillia,</hi> are incident to <hi>Pharicles:</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be appeached of want, nor condemned of lacke, neyther his
person nor mind in any wise misliked.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Mamillia,</hi> conster of my wordes, as you please, &amp; like
where you loue, so that I may neither repent my talke, nor you
curse my counsell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mamillia,</hi> Gentlemen, was driuen into such a maze with this
sodaine motion of Madam <hi>Castilla,</hi> that she stood, as though her
heart had bin on her halfepe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny, fearing the fetch of her old nurse,
doubting what a fleeue she shoulde shape for the coate, least shee
should be ouertaken in misliking so lightly: or (though not very
chary of her choyse) in choosing so quickly: therefore she framed
her answere betweene both on this maner.</p>
            <p>MAdam, if I stand in a mase which haue the harme, thinke it
not strange, sith you maruel, which are not toucht. For I
may more muse of the rumour which know it contrary: than
you, which doe but call it in question. But if <hi>Florion</hi> haue heard
a lye, and you beleeue it: it is not my fault, but your lightnesse of
credit: and therefore construe of it how you can: for I am at a
good poynt. Old women wil quickly conceiue, &amp; soone beleeue:
for age is as credulous, as suspitious; the dried oake wil sooner
fire, than the greene Ashe; &amp; olde ragges wil sooner burne, than
new linnen; the green apple is hard to pearce, when the old fruit
wil quickly bruse: so age though they be slow in hearing, yet they
are swifter in beleeuing then youth, that the least sparke of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiousnesse,
wil fire their whole brayne. And therefore he that
knoweth their fault, &amp; wil not beare with it, is much too blame.
Whereas you draw your perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for my credite, of your talk
from your gray haires, it sheweth surely but a greene wit, not
so ful of grauity, as either your age or yeeres requires: For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
your reasons would haue tended to ciuility, &amp; not to sensuality,
to vertue, &amp; not to vanity. Your paines you tooke with me in my
swadling cloathes, your care in my youth to nurse me in vertue,
and your ioy in my ripe yeeres to see mee addicted to the same,
shewes by the end that your care was but slender, &amp; your ioy fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
The Cowe which giueth good store of mylke, &amp; spilleth it
<pb facs="tcp:20420:15"/>
with her foote, is as much to be blamed for the losse, as to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for the giftt. The water which for a time beareth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
&amp; at last with the waues ouerwhelmeth the same, doth more
harme in drowning the Barke, then good in bearing it. The hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which trayneth the hounde being young, truely to cal vpon
the sente, is much too blame to beate him from it being olde: so
you Madam, are more to be blamed for perswading me to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie,
than you were before to be commended, for exhorting
me to virginity: for in my tender age my infancie was not able
to receiue your counsell, and then you tolde me howe greatly I
ought to esteeme virginity: and nowe in my rype yeeres, when
I can conceiue your meaning, you wish me vtterly to forsake it:
either then sure you were in a wrong opinion, or els nowe in an
errour, but howsoeuer it was, my mind is setled. Uirginity you
say is delightful, yet matrimony more pleasant: Virginity you
put in the positiue, but matrimonie in the superlatiue. Well, I
pray God you make not marriage so farre to exceed in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
that at last it growe to an extremitie. But as your age is
much giuen to the shaking palsey: so I thinke your argumentes
haue a spice of the same disease: for their foundation is but fickle,
&amp; therfore the lesse worth to be taken at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hardest. The tal Cedar
that beareth only bare blossoms, is of more value then the apple
tree that is laden with fruite: the keeper (for all your saying)
makes more account of a barren Doe, than of a bearing hynde.
<hi>Diana</hi> shal obtaine more same for her chastity in the hunting of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
woods, than <hi>Venus</hi> for her lasciuious honestye in playing with
<hi>Mars</hi> in her bed. Uirginity shalbe esteemed as a rare &amp; precious
iewel, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marriage shalbe counted but a custome. The baytree
growing single by it self, flourisheth greene; whereas being clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with the yuie, it withereth: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gold of it self hath a galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hue,
but being touched, it changeth colour: the Saphyre stone clasped
in mettal, looseth his vertue: so a virgin being once married, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
straight, changeth colour, and looseth her chiefest trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
And though you say by course of kind that nothing is more
vnseemely then an olde wrinckled mayde: yet experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs, that nothing is more vnlikely than an olde withered
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20420:15"/>
wife. The Rose dying on the stalke, seemeth in better state then
that which fadeth, being pluckt: the grasse looketh better being
vncut, then that which withereth with the sieth: for the one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
by course of nature; and the other by kinde of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Phenix being seldome seene, the more desired; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
the Gemme is, the more esteemed. The stones of <hi>Arabia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they be straunge, are of greatest price: so virginitie, by so
much the more is to be regarded, by how much it is more rare
then mariage: for the one commeth by speciall grace, and the
other by common course. Uirginitie among the Romanes was
had in such admiration and estimation, that if by chaunce the
Uestal virgins walked abroad, the Senators would giue them
the vpper hand, and all the officers shew them due reuerence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cybil</hi> the mother of the Gods, was a virgin: and <hi>Minerua</hi> was
famous for three thinges; strength, wisdome, and virginitie.</p>
            <p>The wise woman which gaue Oracles at <hi>Delphos,</hi> was a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
being alwayes called <hi>Pythia.</hi> Uirginitie alters the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of wilde beastes: for the Lyons neuer hurt a pure Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin:
and <hi>Pliny</hi> reporteth that the Unicorne will sleepe on a
virgins lappe. Therefore Madame, your argumentes rather
importe rule, than reason; and seemes to come from a greene
witte, not from a gray head: but though the fowle haue fayre
feathers, he may haue rancke flesh; the fish may haue glistering
skales without, and yet be rotten within: so your outwarde
shew of grauitie, may inwardly be addicted to vanitie, and old
folke are twise children: and perhappes though your face bee
wrinckeled, your minde is youthfull; though your yeeres
and calling argue chastitie, yet you had as leefe haue hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande,
as wishe mee marryed: and I promise you for my
parte,
I had rather you shoulde eate of the meate, then I
taste of the sauce: if it be not a knot of bondage, but a band of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
I would haue you once againe try that freedome. But
sure eyther you know more then all, or els say more then you
know: for not onely the common people, but also the most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
hath thought maryage to be such a restraint of libertie, as it
feeleth no sparke of freedome: for both the body is giuen as a
<pb facs="tcp:20420:16"/>
slaue vnto the will of an other man, and the minde is subiecte to
sorow and bound in the caue of care: so that euen the name of a
wife importes a thousand troubles. If you call this libertie, I
know not what bondage is. Who so is addicted to maryage,
findeth it easie but in one respect, and that is, if she chaunce on a
good husband, which indeede you brauely set out in his colours.
But so did <hi>Aristotle</hi> his happy man; <hi>Tully,</hi> his Orator, <hi>Plato</hi>
his common Wealth, and in our countreye heere, one of
my kinsmen sets out the liuely Image of a Courtier. But as
these spoke of such, but could neuer finde them: so you haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
such a husband, as can neuer be heard of. Yet, Madame,
you go further: for the others spoke in generall, and you for the
better confirmation of your reason, inferre a particular, and that
is <hi>Pharicles,</hi> whom indeed I confesse to haue in outward shew,
as good qualities as any in all Italy. But the hearbe, though it
haue a fayre hue, and a sweete sappe, yet being tasted, it may be
infectious. The Panther with his paynted skinne and sweete
breath, hath a tyrannous heart: so <hi>Pharicles</hi> may bee as foule
within, as faire without; and if he be not, he digresseth from his
kind: for these Gentlewomen which haue trusted to the beautie
of the face, haue beene deceiued with the deformitie of the mind.
<hi>Theseus, Demophoon, Aeneas, Iason,</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> were
both famous for their feature and fortitude, and renoumed for
their inuincible valure, and yet they wanne not so much fame for
their prowes in warre, as shame for their inconstancy in loue:
he that chooseth an apple by the skinne, and a man by his face,
may be deceiued in the one, and ouershot in the other. Therefore
Madame, sith both mariage is troublesome, and the choyce so
doubtfull, I meane not to proue the care, nor try the chance, but
remaine a virgin still. Yet thus much to your question, if my
minde should change to try such happe, I would welcome <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles,</hi>
as well as any other.</p>
            <p>Madame <hi>Castilla</hi> hearing this ouerthwartnes of <hi>Mamillia,</hi>
was driuen into a great mase, to see the Gentlewoman so hoat
with her: in so much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> as old women are soone angry, she tooke
pepper in the nose at the sharpe reply, and therefore framed her
as quicke an answere.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:20420:16"/>
               <hi>MAmillia,</hi> quoth she, if the Phisitions rubbe the soare, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
must needes sturre; touch a galled horse, and he will
winch: so your hotte answere shewes my question toucht you in
the quicke; and that though you make so straunge with mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
yet if your choyce were in your owne handes, you woulde
giue a finall farewell to virginitie. But the Fox will eate no
grapes: and you will not marry, because you may, or perhappes
do loue, where your friendes wil not like, and your wish should
be contrary to their will. <hi>Sirichia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Smald</hi> king
of the Danes, could not be perswaded by her father to forsake
her virginitie, but the third day after his death, she was betroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
but to a meane Squire: <hi>Manlia</hi> Daughter of <hi>Mauritius</hi>
was so scrupulous of her virginitie, that she altogether aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
the company of wiues and widdowes, and yet at length
she tooke an husband, and was so kinde harted, that she woulde
not sticke to sell large peniworths of her honestie. <hi>Mamillia,</hi>
I will not make comparisons, because they be odious, nor infer
any conclusions, for feare of farther daunger. But take this by
the way, that he which couers a small sparke in the ashes, will
procure a great flame. And with this she departed, as halfe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
leauing <hi>Mamillia</hi> very sorowfull that she had displeased
her old nource, and very carefull for the yssue of her new loue:
yet, as much as she could dissembling the matter, she past away
the day in mery company.</p>
            <p>But all this while <hi>Pharicles</hi> had a flea in his eare, and a
thorne in his foote, which procured him little rest. For as the
wounded Deare stayes in no place: so the passionat louer staies
but without stedfastnes, neuer hauing a quiet minde: for if hee
sayle, Loue is his Pylot: if he walke, Loue is his companion:
if he sleepe, Loue is his pillow: so that alwayes he hath the spur
in his side, to procure his disquiet, hauing no salue for his soare,
vnlesse he reap remedy at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hands of his aduersary, which <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi>
tryed true. For there passed no houre after his departure
from <hi>Mamillia,</hi> in which a thousand cares did not clogge his
combred minde: for the thought of her sharpe answere was hard
to disgest in his crased stomacke: then that her father and he was
<pb facs="tcp:20420:17"/>
of no great acquaintaunce, which was a cause of his long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
Howe if fortune so fauoured, that he gayned her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will?
yet hee lost his owne freedome, and that was but a signe
of an yll chapmanne: Howe oftentimes they, which sued to
marrye in haste, did finde sufficient time to repent them at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?</p>
            <p>And surely Gentlemen, if <hi>Pharicles</hi> had rested on this point,
in my iudgement he had hit the marke: for there is no such hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunce
to a man, as a wife: if respecting warre, <hi>Darius</hi> and
<hi>Methridates</hi> are witnesses: of learning and Philosophy, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
comes in as plaintife: so in my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if men would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
marry, they should neuer be marred: and if they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue a wife, they should alwayes want strife: for she is that
burden that Christ onely refused to take from mens shoulders:
yea some haue called a wife, a heauy Crosse, as a mery iesting
Gentleman of <hi>Venice</hi> did: who hearing the preacher command
euery man to take vp his Crosse, and follow him hastily, tooke
his wife on his shoulders, &amp; said he was ready with the formost:
but least in talking of crosses, I be crost for a foole in going
beyonde my commission, againe to <hi>Pharicles:</hi> who though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes
hee read these, or suche like examples, yet his hot loue
warmed his affection: so whatsoeuer he mused in his minde, it
would not abate his deuotion, but still sought sundry meanes to
breake to his Saynt: and yet the farder he went, the more hee
was from his purpose, that he had past the Caue of care, ready to
enter into the dungeon of despayre, if fortune had not fauoured
his chaunce. For flinging out of his studie, to auoyde this
melancholy, hee went to take ayre in the fieldes, where, by good
happe, hee espyed his Mystresse walking with her nurce to a
graynge place, amyldes distance from <hi>Padua,</hi> to beare certaine
Gentlewomen company, which resorted thither to visit a sicke
patient, at which place was also <hi>Signior Gonsaga,</hi> with other
Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>Pharicles</hi> was dryuen into an extasie, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
pleasure he conceiued by the sodayne sight of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse,
it is no metuaile, sith her absence was the hazarde of his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20420:17"/>
life, and her presence his onely pleasure: and I think, if I may
enter into a womans thought, without offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, <hi>Mamillia</hi> would
not haue wished a fitter companyon to shorten her iourney: yet
she passed on without any semblance of his sight: whereas feare
and necessitie had a deadly combate in the minde of <hi>Pharicles,</hi>
he doubted if he should be ouer bold, he might spill his pottage.
But the law of necessitie, saith <hi>Plato,</hi> is so hard, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Gods the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
selues are not able to resist it. For as the water, by nature cold,
is made hotte by the force of the fire: and the straight tree pressed
downe, growes alwayes crooked: so nature is subiect to neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
that kind cannot haue his course. The litle Mouse, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
fearefull, in daunger is desperate: the Boore in safetie is
timorous, in perril without feare: the Coward in peace dreadeth
the sight of the weapon, whereas being vrged by necessitie, hee
passeth the pikes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ormaus</hi> the Sonne of kinge <hi>Cirus,</hi> by nature was borne
dumbe, yet when the Citie <hi>Suzes</hi> was taken, seeing a souldier
ready to kill his owne Father, cryed out, villayne, saue the
crowne: so that necessitie in him supplyed a want of nature.
And if there bee any thing, which is more forcible then neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
it is the lawe of Loue, which so incensed <hi>Pharicles,</hi> that
casting all feare aside, hee offred him selfe to his Mistres, with
this courteous parle.</p>
            <p>GEntlewoman, if I boldly offer my selfe, as a Copartner
of your voyage, which am a companyon farre vnfitte for
such a company, pardon my fault, sith it commeth of force, and
condemne not my nature of want of nurture; but let your bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
beare the blame, as the spurre of my rash enterprise: For the
Adamant drawes by vertue, though Iron striue by nature: wher
force is: there the fault is forgiuen. But if in any wise my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
might pleasure you, or rather not offend you, I would prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it, if I knew it would be but halfe so well accepted, as harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offred: but perhaps it wil not be worth the wearing, beecause
proffered chaffer stinckes.</p>
            <p>Madame <hi>Castilla</hi> hearing the curtesie of the Gentlemanne,
and perceiuing what Sainte hee serued, to encourage him the

seruice is not more heartily offered, then willingly accepted: &amp;
therefore, if you be content with your happe, wee are very well
pleased with the chaunce.</p>
            <p>And with that she fel in talke with the rest of the company,
to the ende <hi>Pharicles</hi> might vse some speaches to <hi>Mamillia:</hi>
who now seeing the coast cleere, and time and place fitte for the
purpose, gaue her the onset in this manner.</p>
            <p>MIstres <hi>Mamillia,</hi> it hath byn a saying more common then
true, that loue makes al men Orators, yet I my selfe finde
it contrary by experience, insomuch that I thinke the perfect lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
wants not onely Eloquence, but hath a restraint of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The water pot being filled to the brim, yeeldes no licour,
though hauing a hundred holes. The wine vessel beyng ful, lets
passe no wine, though neuer so wel vented. The colour ioyned
hard to the sight, hindreth the sense. The flower put into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nose-thril,
stoppeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> smelling. The louer in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> presence of his Lady,
at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> first is eyther driuen into an extasie for ioy, or els into a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
trau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for feare: so that, when he should plead his cause, his
wits are either bewitched, or els not at home: &amp; if it happen his
tongue be not tied, in many words lies mistrust; and in paynted
speech, deceit is most ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> couered, &amp; specially, where either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
or long continuance hath bred no credit. Therfore I
Mistres <hi>Mamillia,</hi> whose acquaintance with you is smal, &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
lesse, dare vse no circumstance, for feare of mistrust, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I tel in what respect to bring a sufficient triall, or proofe of my
goodwil: but only that I wish the end of my loue to be suche, as
my faith and loyalty, is at this present, whiche I hope tract of
time shal try without spot.</p>
            <p>In the meane time requesting you to thinke that the force of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20420:18"/>
loue hath constrayned me to yeeld as a slaue, readye at beauties
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand to hazard my life for your pleasure: I must needs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the gifts of Nature so abundantly bestowed vpon you, haue so
bewitched my senses, that for my last refuge, I am forced to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
vnto your curtesie, as a soueraigne medicine for my incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
disease: incurable I may tearme it, vnles y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> drops of your
fauour quench the flame, or els death with his deadly dart decide
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause. But I hope it is vnpossible, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> such a crystal breast should
lodge an hart of Adama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> such a sugred face should haue a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
minde: that your diuine beauty should bee ouergrowne with
hellish cruelty, to torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who for your loue sustaynes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
miseries. Miserie I may wel cal it: for as there is nothing
more pleasant then beauty: so nothing is more yrksome tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
&amp; yet my restraunt of liberty is so much the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by how much the more it is desired. For although y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> flye wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
fries in the flame, yet she is blameles: although the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
loues her mortall enemy, yet is she not faultie, sith the one
comes of affection, and the other by course of nature.</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>Mamillia,</hi> thy beauty hath bought my freedom, &amp; thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly
face hath made me captiue, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as he which is hurt of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

minister y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> medicine, which procures the disease. The burning fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
is driuen out with a hot potion, and the shaking palsey with
a colde drinke. Loue onely is remedied by loue, and fancy muste
be cured by mutuall affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore <hi>Mamillia,</hi> I speake with
teares out wardly, &amp; with drops of blood inwardly, that vnles y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
misling showres of your mercie, mittigate the fire of my fancy, &amp;
giue a soueraigne plaister for my secret sore, I am like to passe
my life in greater miserie, then if I had tasted the infernall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
for <hi>Sophocles</hi> being demanded, what harme hee woulde
wish to his enemy, answered, that he might loue where he was
not liked, &amp; that such misfortune might haue long lasting. But
perhaps you wil say, <hi>Mamillia,</hi> that the beasts which gase at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
Panther, are guilty of their own death; that the Mouse taken in
the trap, deserueth her chaunce; that a louer, which hath freewill,
deserueth no pitie, if he make not his choyce right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20420:19"/>
Ah <hi>Mamillia,</hi> can the strawresist the vertue of the pure Iet? can
flaxe resist the force of the fire? can a Louer withstand the brunt
of bewtie? or freese, if he stand by the flame, or peruert the lawes
of nature? weigh al things in the balance of equitie, and then I
doubt not but to haue a iust iudgement. But this I assure my
selfe, if you knew the strength of my loue, or the force of my loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie,
though my person and byrth be farre vnfit for such a mate,
yet you would deeme my loue to deserue no lesse: for <hi>Leander</hi>
to his <hi>Hero,</hi> or <hi>Piramus</hi> to his <hi>Thesbe</hi> was neuer more fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
then <hi>Pharicles</hi> will try himself to <hi>Mamillia:</hi> that although
small acquaintance breedes mistrust, and mistrust hinders loue:
yet tract of time shall inferre such a tryall, as trust shal kindle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>And therefore I hope that your noble heart wil not put a doubt
till occasion be offered, nor cal his credit in question, whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you haue found nor heard to be halting. What though the
Serpentine powder is quickly kindled, and quickly out? yet
the Salamander stone, once set on fire, can neuer be quenched:
As the sappy Myrtle tree wil quickly rotte: so the hard Oake
will neuer be eaten with wormes: Though the free stone is
apt for euery impression: yet the Emerauld will sooner breake,
then receiue any new forme: Though the Polipe chaungeth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
euery houre: yet the Saphyre will cracke before it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to disloyaltie. As all things are not made of one mould:
so all men are not of one minde: for as there hath beene a troath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<hi>Iason,</hi> so hath there beene a trustie <hi>Troylus,</hi> and as there
hath beene a dissembling <hi>Damocles,</hi> so was there a loyall <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi>
And sure <hi>Mamillia,</hi> I call the Gods to witnesses, I speake
without fayning, that sith thy bewtie, either by fate or fortune, is
shrined in my heart, my loyaltie shall be such, as the be troathed
fayth of <hi>Erasto</hi> to his <hi>Persida,</hi> shal not compare with the loue
of <hi>Pharicles</hi> to <hi>Mamillia.</hi> Sith therefore my loue is such,
repaye but halfe so much in parte of recompence, and it will
be suffycient to release my sorrowe. But alas, who can lay
their loue where is no desert, and where want breedes a flat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:20420:19"/>
Ah <hi>Mamillia,</hi> Nature by her secreete iudgement hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all creatures with some perfect qualities, wher want breedes
mislyking. The Moule depriued of sight, hath a woonderfull
hearing: the Hare being very fearefull, is most swift: the fish ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no eares, hath most cleere eyes; so I, of meane wealth, and
lesse witte, haue giuen me by nature such a loyal hart, as I hope
the perfection of the one will supply the want of the other, and
if the choyce had beene in my handes, it shoulde haue beene as it
is: therefore sith in you onely consistes my safetie, and that your
bewtie hath gayned the chiefest place in my heart: Whereof I
hope when time shal be fauourable to my desire, to make suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
tryal, I humbly beseech you to take pitie vppon him, whose
life &amp; death consistes in your answer: and to let it be such, as you
may haue a faithfull seruant for euer.</p>
            <p>ALthough these wordes of <hi>Pharicles,</hi> Gentlemen, did not
greatlye displease <hi>Mamillia,</hi> beecause it is verye harde to
anger a woman with praising her, and especially, if she think as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
of her selfe as others speake, yet she would haue hid fire in
the straw, and haue daunced in a net, striuing as much as shee
could, with a discontented countenaunce to couer a contented
mind, and to seeme as cruel as a Tygre, though as meeke as a
Lambe, least either by outward shewe or words hee might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture
some hope of good happe, she gaue him this cold confect
for his hotte stomacke.</p>
            <p>SYr, quoth she, although the common prouerb saieth, that the
Citie which comes to parle, and the woman that lendes an
attentiue eare, the one is soone sacked, and the other is easilye
gayned: yet I would wish you not to conceiue any hope, or spend
any trauaell: for your hope shal be voyd, and your labour lost.</p>
            <p>For although I was so foolish to lend you mine eare, I am wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
enough in letting of my heart: for as you found me prodigall
in the one, you shall finde me as niggardly in the other. But
as fables are good enough to passe away the time, so your talke
will seeme to shorten the way, and so I take it. For it is yll hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
before a Cryple, and a burnt childe will feare the fire. And
though I neede not doubt, because I was neuer burnt, yet is it
<pb facs="tcp:20420:20"/>
good to beware by an other mans harme: the Mouse that seeth
her fellow taken in the trappe, and ventureth her self, deserueth
no pittie, if she be caught: the Foxe seeing his marrow almost
kilde with the dogges, is a foole, if he take not squat: it is hard
taking of fowle, when the net is descried: and yll catching of
fish, when the hooke is bare: it is hard, <hi>Pharicles,</hi> to make her
beleeue, that will giue no credit, &amp; to deceiue her that spyeth the
fetch: when the string is broken, it is hard to hit the white: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a mans credit is called in question, it is hard to perswade one.</p>
            <p>Blame me not, <hi>Pharicles,</hi> if I vrge you so strictly, nor thinke
nothing, if I suspect you narrowly: a woman may knit a knot
with her tongue, she cannot vntie with all her teeth: and when
the signet is set on, it is too late to breake the bargayne: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I had rather mistrust too soone, then mislike too late, I had
rather feare my choyce, then rue my chaunce: I had rather stop
at the brimme, then at the bottome. A womans heart is like the
stone in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that will quickly receiue a forme, but neuer
chaunge without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>racking: therefore, if I receiue any, it shal be
such a one, as I shall not repent me: I put an if in it, because I
doe not meane to chaunge virginitie with mariage, for it would
be too hard a bargaine: for we see those women, which haue bin
counted most wise, haue beene most chaste, and so fearefull to
match, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they durst not once cal it in question. <hi>Faza,</hi> the princesse
of <hi>Gaule,</hi> when she knew her father had promysed her in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
wept so long, til she became blind. <hi>Parthenia</hi> after she was
maryed, and had tryed by childebirth the difference betweene
virginitie and mariage, she would neuer after companye with
her husband, saying, that a lasting vertue was to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a fading vanitie: sith therfore the most wise haue feared and
eschewed, thinke me not cruell, if I be wise for my self, nor iudg
me not scrupulous, though I put a doubt before I haue cause; or
be in dread to buy repentance at an vnreasonable rate, for if I
were minded to marry, I shoulde hardly find one fish among so
many Scorpions, or one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eral among so many broken glasses.
The woolfe hath as smooth a skin as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> simple sheepe: the sower
Elder hath a fayrer bark the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sweet gineper: where the water
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20420:20"/>
is calmest, there it is deepest; and where the sea is most quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
it is most daungerous; where is the greatest colour of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie,
there oftentimes is the most want: for an empty vessell
hath a lowder sound then a full barrell, and a dissembling minde
hath more eloquence then a faythfull hart: for trueth is euer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
I will not apply the comparison, <hi>Pharicles,</hi> to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
but in generall: yet if the propositions be vniuersal, they
may inferre in the conclusion a perticular person. The Poets
and paynters representing the loue of menne, bring in <hi>Cupid</hi>
with a payre of winges; disciphering the loue of women, a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuse
vnder the feete of <hi>Venus:</hi> she wing that as the loue of men
is moueable, and vnconstant as a byrde: so the fancy of women
is as firme &amp; fixed, as a stedfast Tortuse. And with great reason:
for neyther the Romishe recordes, nor Grecian hystories haue
made any, or at the least so oft mention of the disloyaltie of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
but onely how their simplicitie hath beene beguyled by the
flatterie of faigned louers, of whome the most renomned may
beare sufficient witnes: (as <hi>Theseus, Iason, Hercules, Aeneas</hi>
and <hi>Demophon</hi>) that the loue of men hath euer beene incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant:
yet they so reioysed at their infamous deedes, that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
canonized them, not only for saints, but placed them among
the Gods, so that others of base estate, taking example by
them, doe vaunt of their disloyaltie, as of some glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and as <hi>Herostratus</hi> fiered the temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, so they falsifie their faith, to be famous. Yet it is a world
to see how the deepest dissembler of them all, can haue teares ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>commaund
to deceaue a simple mayde? What sighs? what sobs?
what prayers? what protestations? their talke burnes as hotte
as the mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> when as their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as cold as a clock:
it is not the loue of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> maid, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lust of their mind, not her boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but her bewtle; so that euery face sets them on fire; euery la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
be she louely, must be their mistres. But no maruel, for if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
are chollericke, hot in their loue, and dry in their fayth, soone set
on fire, and soone quenched: their loue is euen as lasting as the
flame in the straw: which is as litle permanent, as it is violent, or
like the Apples in <hi>Arabia,</hi> which begin to rot, ere they be halfe
rype.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20420:21"/>
Well <hi>Pharicles,</hi> although I cast all these doubtes, and others
haue tryed them true, yet I am forced by fancy to take some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morce
of thy tormentes. <hi>Medea</hi> knew the best, and did followe
the worst in choosing <hi>Iason:</hi> but I hope not to finde thee so wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering.</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>Pharicles,</hi> I haue beene brought vp in the court, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
my bewtie be small and witlesse, yet I haue beene desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of many, and could neuer fancy any: thou hast wonne the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
that many haue besieged, and hast obtained that which others
haue sought to gaine: it is not the shape of thy bewtie, but the
hope of thy loyaltie, which enticeth me, not thy fayre face, but thy
faythful heart; not thy comely countenaunce, but thy curteous
manners; not thy wordes, but thy vertues: for she that buyldes
her loue vpon bewty, meanes to fancy but for a while: for where
the subiect is fading, the cause cannot be lasting. Would God,
<hi>Pharicles,</hi> I might finde thee but such a one, as I will try my
selfe to bee: for whereas thou dost protest such loyaltie; and put
case it be as true as it may be: yet it shall be but counterfeite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
mine: be thou but <hi>Theagines,</hi> and I will try my selfe
to be more constant then <hi>Cariclia:</hi> no torments, no trauayle, no,
onelye the losse of life shall dimmishe my loue: in liewe thereof
remayne thou but constant, and in pledge of my protested good
wyll, haue heere my hearte and hande to be thine in duste and
ashes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MAmillia</hi> hauing thus ended her talk, I leaue you to iudge,
gentlemen, into what a quandarie <hi>Pharicles</hi> was brought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
seeing the answere of his Mistresse to be so correspondent with
his demaund, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fortune was so fauourable to his desire, as she
seemed to will, that he did wish. For if the condemned man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyseth,
when he heareth his pardon pronounced, or the prisoner
his freedome, no doubt <hi>Pharicles</hi> ioy could be no lesse, sith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
was his death, and consent, the conserue to heal his wound:
the greater care, the greater ioy: the more doubt, the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
so his vnlookt for hap brought such an inspeakable conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as forced through the extremity of his passions, and ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the constrant of his affection, he burst forth into this talk.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:20420:21"/>
               <hi>MAmillia,</hi> if where the water standeth most still, there it is
deepest, and when the winde is lowest, then the greatest te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
is imminent: so where the minde with ouermuch ioy, or too
much payne is surcharged, there the tongue is both tyed, and the
countenaunce restrayned: so that as the heart is not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it, the tongue is not able to expresse it, as the water potte,
which being full, voydeth no licquour. <hi>Publius Metellius</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Sonne had subdued the <hi>Equiars,</hi> died forioy. <hi>Cassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
conceaued such a pleasure in seeing his father winne a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
in <hi>Olympus,</hi> that he kild himselfe with inward laughter.
If I infer the similitude, perhaps it wil breede doubt: for deedes
in loue are to be required, and not words. Therefore, for feare I
incurre the suspition of flattery, I will leaue you to coniecture
of that, which I thinke.</p>
            <p>But this by the way, assure your selfe, Mistresse <hi>Mamillia,</hi>
that your bewtie hath so blinded me, as I shall neuer see any,
which so well shal content my minde: and your bountie hath
bounde me neuer to lyke any other. Thus enueigled with the
one, and fettered with the other, I remayne your true seruaunt
for euer.</p>
            <p>WHile they were in these tearmes, Madam <hi>Castilla</hi> thought
<hi>Pharicles</hi> had giuen the forte a suffycient battery, for this
tyme: therefore ioyning to them with the rest of the company,
she enterrupted them on this maner.</p>
            <p>MIstresse <hi>Mamillia,</hi> I beleeue you will go with a cleane
soule to visit the sicke patient: for if you haue beene al this
while at shrift, you might both haue confessed a great many of
faultes, and receiued full absolution. But I pray God your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly
Father be as holy for the soule, as wholsome for the body: &amp;
if he be, surely you haue heard good counsell: if not: it is Saint
<hi>Erauncis</hi> fault, he wantes his hoode.</p>
            <p>Madame, quoth <hi>Mamillia,</hi> if you thinke so well of my goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlye
Father and his shrift, I pray you let him haue you in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
as long: for you are eldest, and therefore had neede of a
longer examination and larger absolution, if hee be holye for
the soule, he hath enough to take care of his own: as for myne,
<pb facs="tcp:20420:22"/>
I will take charge of my selfe: if wholsome for the body, the
more fitte for your purpose, sith old women are full of diseases,
and had neede haue a Phisition tyed by their girdle: as for saint
<hi>Frauncis</hi> fault, as you tearme it, if that be a hinderaunce of his
comming, I am sure to pleasure you, he will take the paynes to
fetch it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharicles</hi> hearing the tauntes of the Gentlewomen, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he was come to the Gentlemans place: because he was
not well acquainted, though against his will, though best for
that time to take his leaue: and therefore offred them the fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
with this priuy quip.</p>
            <p>Madame, if my keeping the Gentlewoman so long at shrift,
hath beene in any respect offensiue to you, I am very sory: but
if I may stand you as long in steede of a gostly Father, and so
pleasure you, I am at commaund: mary my commission is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for worde nor deede, and therefore I doubt your confession
will be too large for mee to deale with all. But sith I haue
brought you thus farre: and am altogether vnaequainted with
the Gentleman, I will take my leaue to depart home, although
against my will.</p>
            <p>Nay surely, quoth Madame <hi>Castilla,</hi> your hast shall make
waste, and your small acquaintaunce shalbe no hinderance: for
at this time you shall be my guest, and with that they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place, where after they had saluted the company, and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the sicke person, Madam <hi>Castilla</hi> requested the gentleman
to welcome the stranger for her sake, who both had taken paines
to beare them company, and through his pleasaunt conceites
procured the way to seeme shorter. <hi>Signior Gonzaga</hi> taking
occasion to shew his good will to <hi>Pharicles,</hi> aunswered: that
sith the maister of the house was not well, he would say the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
was welcome in his befalfe: and so taking him by the
hand, welcomed him very friendly. Which curtesie of <hi>Gonza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi>
was no lesse pleasure vnto <hi>Pharicles,</hi> then contentation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Mamillia,</hi> to see him whom they most doubted, to shew such
a friendly countenaunce, that they both hoped to haue a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:20420:22"/>
Now this sicke Gentleman, called <hi>Gostino,</hi> had one onely
daughter, named <hi>Publia,</hi> about the age of sixteen yeeres, whose
bewty and bringing vp, shewed that she was in no respect seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
vnto <hi>Mamillia:</hi> but rather more perfect in the giftes of nature.
This young Gentlewoman being by the mothers side cosinue
Germaine to <hi>Mamillia,</hi> after her duetie done to the company,
requested them to take such a simple dinner, as her father in so
short a time could prouide: giuing them also to vnderstand by her
behauiour, that the influence of the heauens had denyed her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
but that nurture had forced her self to augment the grace
of nature, and that comlines of body, and curtesie of the minde
hadde a continuall warre, which shoulde haue the superyori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>This gorgeous Goddesse furnished with these singular qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
in euery respect, so set on fire <hi>Pharicles</hi> fancy, that as if he
had drunke of the fountaines in <hi>Ardenia,</hi> his hot loue was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to as cold a lyking.</p>
            <p>Now his heart was set vpon <hi>Publia,</hi> which of late was vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Mamillia,</hi> in such a sorte, that his stomacke lost the woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
appetite to feede the eyes with the bewtie of his new God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse,
as that he seemed to haue eaten of the hearbe <hi>Spattania,</hi>
which shutteth vp the stomacke for a long season. And <hi>Publia</hi>
on the contrary side, noting the feature of <hi>Pharicles,</hi> the comly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his person, and the rarenes of his qualities, was so scort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with the bewtie of this new guest, as finding occasion to
conuey her selfe into her closet, vnder the colour of some serious
businesse, she powred forth her plaintes in this order.</p>
            <p>O vnhappy fortune, O lucklesse destinie, hath <hi>Publia</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a banquet to entrappe her selfe with a more daincy delicat?
hath she layde the net, and is taken in the snare? hath shee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed
him that hath caught her captiue: well, now I see, that
as the Bee that flyeth from flower to flower, hauing free choyce
to chuse at libertie, is at last taken by the winges, and so fette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
in like manner my fancy taking the viewe of euery face,
hath a restraint of her freedome, and is brought in bondage with
the bewty of this straunger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20420:23"/>
Alas, what shall I doe? Shal I loue so lightly? shal Fancie
giue me the foyle at the first dash? shal myne eyes be the cause of
my miserie? would God they had lost their sight in the cradle,
shal my heart be so tender, to yeelde at the first call? would God
nature had framed it of Adamant, to resist the force of such foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
cogitations.</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>Publia,</hi> consider thy state: what hath he more to be beelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
then other? thy suters haue had to beliked. What, foole? dost
thou aske a question of Loue, or a reason of Fancy? striue not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the streame: if thou resist Loue, thou art ouermatched.</p>
            <p>For euen the Gods are tributaries vnto <hi>Venus,</hi> as confessinge
the superiorities of beauties kingdomes, then be not thou asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
being but a simple maide. <hi>Venus</hi> loued a black smith with
a poult foote: and thou a Gentleman of singular perfection: yet
as there is a difference betweene thee and <hi>Venus</hi> in bewtie: so
is there a greater distaunce betweene <hi>Vulcan</hi> and him in defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.
Then <hi>Publia,</hi> yeelde when thou must needes consente:
run when thou art called by command: for sure, if euer thou wile
bestowe thy freedome, he is worthy to haue thee captiue: if thou
meanest to marrie, thou canst not haue a meeter match: yea but
how if his heart be placed, and his minde settled? then were I a
great deale better to wayle at the first, then weepe at the last; to
be content with a litle pricke, then with a deepe wound. The
Scorpion, if he touch neuer so lightly, enuenometh the whole
body: the least sparke of wilde fier sets on fire a whole house:
the Coeatrice killeth euen with her sight: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sting of loue woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
deadly: the flame of Fancy fireth the whole bodye: and the
eyes of a Louer are counted incurable: yet the Elephant being
euuenomed with the Uiper, eateth him vp, and is healed, there is
nothing better for burning, then heat of fire, &amp; nothing so soone
killeth a Basilisk, as the sight of a man. Then <hi>Publia,</hi> sith <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi>
hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wound, let him salue the sore: let the fire of
affection driue out the flame of Fancy; and sith thou art hurte
by the eie, be healed by the sight: hope for the best: for thou hast as
much to be loued, as he to be liked: &amp; therfore remain patient, til
thou knowest more. With y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she went out of her closet: but before
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20420:23"/>
her returne the strangers had dined, and were al descanting of
the Gentlemans disease.</p>
            <p>So many heads, so many wits: for some saide it was a feuer,
and proceeded of cold: some, the consumption of the milte, whose
originall was thought some burstines, and ensued of flegme:
some one thing, and some an other: but all I thinke mist the
marke. <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> who heard all their opinions, sayd, that if the
Gentleman were not wel stricken in age, whatsoeuer the disease
was, he would say the first cause was loue: and my reason is this,
quoth he: the oft chaunge of colours, his sodaine traunces, his
sighes in his dreame, the dead stopping of his pulses, and then
their beating a fresh, al these are signes of an vnquiet minde, of
an impatient affection, and to be flat, of loue it selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Signior Gonzaga,</hi> quoth the sicke Gentleman, eyther you
are expert in phisick, or els you speake by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but whether
you doe, you misse the cushion: for my disease doth not proceede
of loue: nor if I were wel, should it: for I haue felt the first dishe
of so variable a tast, that I wil neuer eate of the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: I meane,
I felt the presence of my wife so sweet, and her absence by death
so sowre, as I meane, neuer to try the like hap. But nowe, sith
you are all at leysure, and I very gladde to heare any thing that
might mittigate the paine, or shorten the time, I woulde craue
this boone of you all in general, that one of you woulde satisfie
my minde in this, to tel me what thing it is the common people
call loue.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen of their curtesie could doe no lesse but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discend
to their hostes request: yet euery one alleadging of disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
so that they were forced to cast lots, who shoulde discusse
this hard question: &amp; amongst al, the chance fel vpon <hi>Pharicles,</hi>
which although it was some small griefe vnto him, because hee
doubted of his habilitye: yet hee thought Fortune fauoured
him in this poynt, that he might shew his cunning before <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where I cannot but muse, Gentlemen, to see that such moyst
licour shold turne to hard flint: that the most wholsome Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
in twise shifting, should be deadly poyson: that the Reedes
<pb facs="tcp:20420:24"/>
in <hi>Candie,</hi> will of their owne nature beecome bitter gall: that
the loue of men should turne to hard harted: that fancy should be
quenched at the second sight: that the affection of <hi>Pharicles,</hi>
should turne to frantik folly, in mislyking without cause, and
choosing without tryall: but it is not so common, as true, that
men be fickle in their fayth, brittle in their braine, and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme
in their loue: neither hot nor cold, euen like the Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
that keepeth the baight in his mouth, to cast out at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
yet where doe we see any writing of loue, or of any such
matter: but they must haue one fling at women? dispraysing
their nature, disciphering their nurture, painting out their pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke
practises and subtil shiftes, declaring their mutabilitie,
comparing them to the <hi>Polipe</hi> stone, that chaungeth colours e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
houre; to the Weathercock, that wauereth with the wind;
to the Marigolde, whose forme is neuer permanent, but chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
with the Sunne: and yet they themselues a great deale
worse: as <hi>Pharicles,</hi> one of the same sect presently shal proue:
who fryed at euery fire, and chaunged his looke at euery leeke,
as one that builded vppon bewtie, and not bountie; that did lust,
but not loue; with which fickle feuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentlemen of our time
are greatly troubled: for he that cannot looke &amp; laugh, and tel a
tale with <hi>nulla fide,</hi> they wil straight note him in ther tables for
a dunce, or put him in their bookes for a foole: and yet they wil
needes fry in frost, &amp; freese in fire: they see, &amp; yet are blind: they
heare without eares, they spend the day in sighing, and the night
in sobbes; they haue heapes of care, streames of teares, waues
of woe: yea, to be short, they like without loue, and fancy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
affection, that their choyce must needes chaunge, because it
is without reason.</p>
            <p>But againe to <hi>Pharicles,</hi> who seeing necessitie on the one
side, and his credit on the other, to be two spurres in his side, and
that the Gentlemen were attentiue, began on this manner.</p>
            <p>THe Poets and Paynters fayned not fortune blinde, without
good cause, and great reason: for as her gifts are vncertaine:
so the lotte is doubtfull, and the chaunce vnlooke for, most often
happeneth: she imparteth wealth to the foole, and pouertie to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20420:24"/>
the wise: she powreth water into the Sea, when it ouerfloweth,
and giueth riches to him that is cloyed with aboundance: doe
we not see, that were is most neede, there she giueth least? and
the most noble men haue the woorst lucke? <hi>Policrate</hi> is a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of her mutabilitie, by his miserable end: and <hi>Abdolomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
a patterne of her frailtie, by his good happe: and I heere
may serue for a proofe of her small skill, that hath layed a great
burden on me, which am leest able to beare it. But on the small
braunch hangeth oft the most fruit; and on the woorst wit som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
chaunceth the greatest charge: for neither my experience
by nurture, nor my wit by nature, hath wherof to compare with
the worst of the company, and yet fortune by lot hath layde the
most on me, so that he that woorst may, must hold the candle.</p>
            <p>But sith a man must needes go when the diuel driues, although
I know my faulte, and you shall finde it, yet the hope of your
curtesie, voyde of curiositie, somewhat encourageth my slender
skill to presume the farther, although beetweene your learned
eares and my rude tongue there will be great discord. I will
not doe as <hi>Hiarbitas</hi> and <hi>Hermonides,</hi> who striuing to excell
in musicke, for euer lost their voyces, least if I force my selfe in
eloquence to seeme a courtier, I proue at length a flat carter.
<hi>Astorides</hi> seeing <hi>Roscius</hi> gestures, durst neuer after come on
the stage: <hi>Hiparchion</hi> hearing <hi>Rufinus</hi> blowe vpon his pipe,
would neuer after play on his flute. Two thinges daunte the
minde of a young man; eyther the skill or person of the hearer.
<hi>Demosthenes</hi> the famous Orator of <hi>Athens</hi> was so astonished
at the maiestie of king <hi>Philyp,</hi> that he lost his speech: <hi>Carnitus</hi>
seing <hi>Anniball</hi> comming into the schooles, became dumb: then
it is no meruaile, gentlemen, if I be afrayed to incur the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
proueth. A fooles bolt is soone shot; or to doubt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my green wit
should giue a rash reason, or enter too far in mine own conceite,
which was so hurtful to <hi>Marsias,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with his pipe would imitate
<hi>Apollos</hi> harp. Notwithstanding as the prick of the spurre for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the horse that feareth the euill way, so in this my doubt the
reuerence I beare to <hi>Gostino</hi> and the rest of the company bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
al feare, assuring my selfe you will lay the fault vpon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb facs="tcp:20420:25"/>
who made the lotte so vnequall, and let my vniust chaunce
serue for a sufficient excuse: and if I happe to stretch too farre,
I wil blowe the retrayte with repentance which neuer commeth
without pardon.</p>
            <p>When I coniecture with my selfe, Gentlemen, the great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
and industry that the auncient Philosophers, and learned
men haue taken in searching out the secrets of nature, insomuch
that some of them haue put out their owne eyes, to attayne to
the greater perfection, thinking that they were obstacles &amp; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances
of their profound contemplations, as did <hi>Democles.</hi>
Others being extreemely delighted with supernaturall cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
aud enamoured of the Mathematical artes, with gazing
vp into the skie, haue fallen backward, and broken their neckes,
as did <hi>Gallus:</hi> some searching out the essence of the first mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
waded so farre in the depth of Astronomy, seeking out the
causes of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, that they drowned
themselues, as <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Others coueting to know the sense of
secret maters scanning the quidities of Logike, haue lost their
wittes, as <hi>Crinitus,</hi> and many other moe. I cannot but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
that among al these secretaries of nature, there haue neuer
byn found any which haue enterprised to search out the essence
and perfect nature of loue. Sure I thinke they might answeare
with <hi>Hermes,</hi> who being dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded what God was, said he could
neuer giue answeare, because the farther he went, the more was
behinde, yet in my iudgement the true loue is no other thing,
but a desire of that which is good; and this good is the influence
of the celestiall bountie: so that by the definition it is to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the intellectuall part of the mynd, and not in the sensuall:
but your question <hi>Signior Gostino</hi> is of that which the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
people cal loue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ouid,</hi> who thought himselfe a maister of that art, and writ
precepts of the same, thought it more obscure then the Letters
of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or the riddles of <hi>Sphinx,</hi> to tel the perfect definition
of loue: so that being demanded what it was, answered, that hee
knew not what it should be, from whence it sprong, whether it
went, nor to what end it tended: but sure, quoth he, it is the losse

stayed minde of <hi>Publia,</hi> to swarue from the vowed virginitie:
so that thinking my selfe as chaste, as any in <hi>Padua,</hi> I proue the

without compulsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the first assault, the first shot, the first Alarm,
yea the first worde hath scaled the walles, wonne the Fort, and
caught me captiue. Alas, what will they say, that praysed me for
my vertue? will they not as fast disprayse me for my vice? will
not my father fret, my kinsfolke cry out, my friendes be sory, my
enemies laugh me to scorne? yea, will not al the world wonder,
to see me of late giuen to chastitie, and now shake handes with
virginitie? to yeeld my deerest Iewel and chiefest treasure vnto
the straunger? The choyce of a friend requireth the eating of
a bushell of salt; then the choosing of a husband, tenne; for by
how much the bande is straighter, by so much the choice should

Ah, nothing, <hi>Publia:</hi> his store procureth thy want, his perfection

sodainely, it would breede some suspition in <hi>Gostinos</hi> heade,

            <p>Where, by the way, Gentlemen, we see <hi>Pharicles</hi> a perfect
patterne of Louers in these our dayes, that beare two faces vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one hoode; and haue as many Ladyes as they haue wittes,
and that is not a fewe: for euery newe face must haue a newe
fancye; and if hee see a thousand, they must all be viewed with
a figh, as though hee were enamoured; if she be younger, her
tender age pleaseth him; if she be of middle age, the rypenesse
of her yeeres, contenteth him: another enchaunteth him with
her voyce, and one with her gestures: so that his couetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire
woulde haue all, and yet amidst this store he is pyned, and
dissembling doubt maketh a restraint of his choyce, yet he must
needes be a Carpet Knight: for they thinke it as harde to lyue
without loue, as without meat. But when they beginne to like,
it is a worlde to see howe they learne to lye: fancy they cannot,
without flattery; nor talk without tales, they be dead at the first
dash, &amp; plunged in <hi>Plutos</hi> pitte, when they haue a merier heart
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore maide. They say, a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the weaker vessel, but
sure in my iudgement, it is in the strength of her body, and not
in the force of her minde: For the rypest witte, the readyest heat;
the moste subtill skonce is fayne to sette his braynes on the last,
and his witte on the tenters to deceiue a simple mayde: first he
assayes with flattery, then with sophistry, inferryng his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons,
he is caught in the beames of her bewtie, as the Bee
in the cobwebbe; hee is parched with the hue of her face, as the
Flye in the candle; hee is drawne by the qualities of her mind,
and the sweetenesse of her voyce, as with a Syrens songue,
and when perhappes she hath nothing to be praysed nor to bee
lyked in her, yet the comlynesse of her bodye, and the rarenesse
of her condicions, hath so enchaunted, as if shee heale not his
wound, he shal as it were with <hi>Circes</hi> cup be turned to a hog or
a horse.</p>
            <p>And this they vse not to one, but to many, counting him a

foole that cannot flatter; and a dol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Pharicles</hi> an Archeaptaine of their crue presently wil prooue,
who knewe the best, and followed the woorst; and could speake
hotlye, but follow it as coldly.</p>
            <p>For after that hee had giuen the raynes of libertie to his
frantike affections, and hadde fostered the sparke to growe to
a great flame, the medicine then came too late, when the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease
was incurable: the more he did striue, the woorse he was:
euen as the Harte, which feeling the arrowe in his side, the
more he forceth him selfe, the farther it entreth; or the byrde
being taken in the nette, by struggling becomes faster: so hee
seeking to eschewe his first maladie, fell into a deeper sicknesse,
perceiuing as the wounde by time is more grieuous then when
the blowe was freshe, so loue encreaseth by delay, and delayes
breede daungers: fearing agayne his hastie venturing might
procure a slacke speedinge, determyned to take counsell at
his pyllowe, and as his minde shoulde giue him, to prosecute
his purpose: and in this doubte hee remayned the space of a
weeke.</p>
            <p>In which tyme <hi>Publia</hi> seeing <hi>Pharicles</hi> made no great haste
in his returne, thought her newe Louer would proue an olde
scoffer, condemning her selfe of follye, that shee should bee so
soone enticed by flatterie, seeking to roote out that by reason,
which was inserted by sensualitie, knowing, no fitter reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

for although you thinke my simple witte hath no such caparitie
to conceiue your vaine iesting, yet all women are not of one
mettall, but as I knowe it, and beare with it: so they wil spy it,
and both blabbe it, and blame it: yea perhappes crosse you out
of their creede: for he that hath beene scratched with the briers,
will take heede of a thorne, and he that sees his felow hurt, will
beware of the like harme; hee that hath beene deceiued with a

take example one by an other: so that it shall bee heard for one
to halt before a cryple: they thinke euery one that writes an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous

A pricke with a penne proued not <hi>Clanuel</hi> a true Louer,

to a blacke wal, that receiueth euery impression, which not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

then they must fill vp the page with slaundering of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who scarsly know what a woman is: but if I were able either by

as I list, which would be as vnseemely, as an Asse to treade

intituled <hi>Alphus:</hi> or els if the Authour were aliue, I woulde not
doubt to perswade him in recompence of his errour, to frame a

exclaim against that sexe, yet it was in his choller, and he infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a generall by a particular, which is absurd. He had an euyll

some one sparke fireth a whole whose? are the bodyes of

poyson? shal we condemne al women of inconstancy, because <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena</hi>
was fickle? or all to be naught, because some one is a shrewe?
if the premises wil infer such a conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I refer me to their grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test
enemy. But for feare of a farther digression, againe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we
left at dinner, who after they had taken a suffycient repast, fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to their former discourse, till <hi>Gonzaga</hi> returning home,
broke off their talke with his presence, entertaining <hi>Pharicles</hi>
very friendly, assuring him he was as welcome as he could wish
him selfe to be, which curtesie was not so heartily offred, as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
reciued. So that it seemed if the one were content, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was as well pleased. Yet <hi>Gonzaga</hi> being as wily as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi>
was wittie, desirous to smell the vane of the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
trayned his hooke with this bayte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharicles,</hi> quoth he, the old Fox that cannot spy the fetch of the
young one, was neuer crafty himself: the Goose that cannot see
<pb facs="tcp:20420:34"/>
the Gosling winke, may seeme to haue a defect of nature: he that
cannot see fire in straw, is surely stone blind: and hee that cannot
spy the flame of fancy, is but a foole. There is none wil so soone
spy one halting, as a cripple: it is hard to couer smoke, but more
hard to conceale loue. I my self both haue tryed it, and nowe I
likewise finde the proofe of it in you, who as closely as you keepe
your cloke, yet I spy the lining, for loue kept in secret is like the
spark couered with ashes, which at length bursteth into a great
flame. But if it be as I thinke, I am glad of it. As I haue taken
care <hi>Pharicles,</hi> to haue my daughter keep her virginity inuiolat
without spot of suspitiousnes, so would I be as willing to yeelde
the fruits of her chastity into the hands of some gentleman, whom
she might both like for loue, &amp; think wel offor his birth &amp; honesty,
rather wishing with <hi>Themistocles</hi> to marrye my daughter to a
man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to money: desiring likewise his choice to be for her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and not for her goodes, least if the knotte should be knit for
wealth, it might be disseuered for pouerty. <hi>Licurgus</hi> would haue
no dowries to be giuen with maides, least some should be liked for
riches, and others loathed for want. The maides of <hi>Essenea</hi> went
neuer bare faced, vntill they were maryed, least bewty should bee
of more force then honesty, esteeming her which was honest, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to haue want of nature, nor lack of nurture: So that <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
I hope if you choose, it shal not be for wealth, which is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
nor for bewty, which is momentary (although I thank God
she can neither blame nature nor fortune) but onelye for vertue
which is permanent: for where the cause is durable, there the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
must néedes be lasting, Loue ought to be like the stone <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicke,</hi>
which is hardly inflamed, but once set on fire, is neuer
quenched: like the Emerauld, which being imprinted, neuer chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
fourme without breaking. Surely, <hi>Pharicles,</hi> I speake
these wordes to you as a friende, and to <hi>Mamillia,</hi> as a father,
wishing well to you for good lyking, and to her by course of
kinde: being willing to marry my daughter, but neyther to buy
her an husband, nor to set her to sale, vnlesse the price bee loue, I
mean that I woulde not make the match by entreatie, nor seeme
to consente lyghtlye, least haste shoulde make waste.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>Pharicles,</hi> although I speake largely, thinke not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20420:34"/>
my consent is any profer. For others of great byrth; and no small
wealth (I will make no comparisons) haue both made great
suite, and offered large feofmentes to haue my good wyll: yet
sith <hi>Mamillia</hi> did not loue, I did not lyke: and what shee doeth
nowe, I am not priuye to it: but if shee doe, my minde perhappes
may bee chaunged: for you knowe olde men are verye suspitious,
and I my selfe doubte by the dreade of others, wee are colde of
complexion, and therefore fearefull by nature, and will quicklye
spye a padde in the strawe, and a snake in the grasse, I perhappes
thinke the Moone is ecclipsed, when she is but chaunging; &amp; gesse
loue is lust, when it is loyaltie, falshood to bee fayth, and trueth to
be treason, iudging vpon meat with a sicke stomacke, and casting
wine with a furred tongue; construing al thinges by contraries,
through the imbecilitie of our witte: sith euery thing is the worse
for wearing: so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he which wil court an old mans daughter, may
be curteous, &amp; yet thought curyous; his liberality may be thought
prodigalitie; his cleanlynesse, pride and vnthriftinesse, that, walke
as warilye as you can, the olde doter will suspect him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharicles,</hi> I speake against mine owne age, and confesse the
frayltie of my nature, that if you chaunce to finde the lyke faulte
in me, that you impute it not to peeuishnesse, but to course of
kinde: For you, <hi>Pharicles,</hi> professe loue to my daughter, and I
thinke it is but dissimulation: you faigne faith, and I doubt of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
you seeme to offend in excesse, and I feare you faint in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
I feare more then you can forge, and all little ynough in my
iudgement. For you, young gentlemen, nowadayes lyke without
loue, and lust without lyking: you fancy euery face, and ech sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
moneth you must haue a new mistresse, wooing as you think,
with great witte, and at length proues without wisdome, so that
as the seede is subtiltie, and the fruite folly, the haruest can reape
but little honesty. <hi>Pharicles,</hi> I inferre no particulars, I told you
my faulte, and therefore blame me not, if I cannot digresse from
nature, but speake what I thinke: for if your conscience be cleare,
it doeth not touch you; if it bee not, I am glad I haue spoken so
much, that eyther you may amende, or els make an ende: for if
my sight fayle me not, one you must doe.</p>

intending to be as wily, as he was wise, gaue false fire to his

            <p>Sir, quoth he, as it is hard to hide the smoake, so were he a foole
that would goe about to couer it, and if fancy must needes be spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who would seeke to cloake it? nature cannot be restrained, nor
loue kept in secret: for the one will come to his course, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seeme light amidst the darknes. I knowing this, (although
you mistake me) neuer thought to loue where I might not come
lawfully, nor to like, where eyther the person or place should haue
neede of a vale for Sunne burning: as for my selfe, I neede none:
therefore, sir, if I halt, it is outright, that more maye perceiue it
then a cryple. But I hope, iudge what you will, you shal find me
stand to my tackling, and to take my course so well by my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
that I shall proue a cunning Pylot, and to shew my selfe so
chary in my choyse, what wares I chuse, that I shall bee a good
Chapman, and the better I trust, in that I haue your counsel. The
Lyons whelp taketh euer the fattest sheepe, when the old sire is
by: the fawne neuer makes so good choyse of his feede, as the old
Bucke; age speaketh by experience, and liketh by tryall, youth
leaneth vpon wit, which is voyd of wisdom. Where the old Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
seaseth, there is euer the best pray: therefore he that will not
be ruled by age, shalbe decided by youth, and hee that will not
heare the admonition of a friend, shal perhaps feele the correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of a foe. This causeth me to thank your counsel, although I was
determined before, for I neuer meant to loue without lasting nor
fancy for a time, least I my self might be the first should repent it,
but was fully resolued to lay my foundation vppon such a rock, as
neither the earthquakes of dissention, nor the tempestes of trouble
may once be able to moue. Now I know wel ynough, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee that

stayneth, as cloath of lighte colour; and nothing to be lesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
then the glasse of bewtie, which beginneth to decay in the
budde, to wither in the blossome, and if it commeth to be fruite, is
rotten before it be halfe ripe. The loue of bewtie, saith <hi>Anacreon</hi>
is the forgetting of reason, the enemy to wit, and to be counted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
a short frensie: for he that loueth onely for bewty, wil eyther
loath when age approcheth, or else soone be glutted with plentie:
wheras fancy fixed vpon vertue, encreaseth euer by continuance.
He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> putteth the Adder in his bosome, delighted with her golden

happy in his chance, by wedding <hi>Egnatia Maximilla:</hi> so that he
which maketh choyce of bewty without vertue commits as much
folly as <hi>Critius</hi> did, in choosing a golden boxe filled with rotten

if I iest, it is without ioy; and so tract of tyme shall try it. You ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

you maye doe so: for I call the Gods to witnesses that the wordes

            <p>
               <hi>GOnzaga</hi> hearing the solemne protestation of the gentleman,

the hyest degree of happines, are driuen to the greatest extremity
of euill, alate placed in paradise, and now plunged in perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
for he no sooner entred his study, but espying the cruell letter
of his mercilesse mistresse <hi>Publia,</hi> frying in fury, burning in rage
and turning his woonted loue to a present hate, euen as the dog
which byteth the stone; or the Bore that in chase teareth the trees;
so he in reuenge of his choller, thought to read ouer this Letter
more for spight then for pleasure; more for lothing then for loue.
But as the birde, when shee is moste carelesse is caught of the
fowler, so <hi>Pharicles</hi> reading in iest, found good earnest; and was
so caught in the hay and taken with the toyles, that his fancy was
fettered with a new charme, and his minde so amazed with this
new musing, that he bestowed all the night in examining particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
euery line of her letter. And though the first part was sharp
and rigorous, yet he found the last to be mixed with mettal of more
mild matter, reading it ouer a thousande tymes, blaming his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and condemning his choler in being so rash to refuse meate
at the first taste, to reiect the Orenge, because the pill was sower;
to disalow the loue of <hi>Publia,</hi> because she made chary of her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie,
his new plighted troath was almost wauering, and waying
at the first assault his feigned fancy, almost eclipsed through fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
folly, insomuch that the hope of his newe luste, had almoste
quenched the shew of his newe loue; the freendlye conclusion of
<hi>Publia,</hi> had well nigh raced out his fayth to <hi>Mamillia;</hi> the desire
of his fond affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so blinded his vnderstanding, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he passed not to

no rules of reason, no feare of lawes, no prickes of conscience, no
respect of honesty, no regard of God or man, could prohibit him
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his pestiferous purpose: for if lawes had bin of force, he knew
his deede was contrary to al lawes, in violating his sacred oath: if
conscience, he knew it terrible: if honesty, he knew wit most wicked:
if God or man, he knew it abhominable in the sight of both.</p>

But too true it is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the force of loue, nay rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fury of lust, doth
neither care for kith nor kin, friend nor foe, God nor the diuell, as

their loue is neuer guided by reason, but by rage: nor their fancy

where their meere substance is as cold as <hi>Caucasus:</hi> their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

they are saints: but being sold, they are serpents: they wil beare a
