            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Lord having given me so great room in so many of your hearts, I am the more encouraged to put these few words of Advice into your hands: Upon your request they were preached in your Ears, and it is for your benefit that they are now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to your Eyes.</p>
            <q>Vox audita perit, litera scripta manet.</q>
            <p>That which you only hear, you may quickly forget, and so the words with the sound perish in the Air; when <hi>written,</hi> especially <hi>printed</hi> words abide, and may bring to your remembrance the things which you have heard long ago: But if you would have these
<pb facs="tcp:49592:3"/>
words in these sheets abide indeed with you, better than if they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon a rock, and written with a Pen of Iron, and point of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, you must get them transcribed and reprinted, I mean upon your hearts. Your hearts as yet in a great measure, are a <hi>rasa tabula,</hi> like a fair table, or white sheet of Paper in which little is written; Do not furrow the Table with Conscience-wounding sins; do not blot and besmear the Paper with the defilements of Lust: But get the Law of God engraven upon the Table of your hearts, and the Counsels of the most High given you out of his Word written upon the white sheet within you. It is true, the youngest of you are defiled with Original sin, and are grown more foul with Actual transgressions, which none of you can in whole excuse your selves from, however for the present
<pb facs="tcp:49592:3"/>
you may be free from the more gross pollutions of the World, and not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to that degree and height of wickedness, which the audacious sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this vicious Age have attained unto: But if you would get the Word written in your hearts, it will both make you clean, and keep you clean, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 9. <hi>Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Word.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Thy Word have I hid in my hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, that I may not sin against thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Youths, my love is great unto your Souls, and my desires are earnest after your salvation; it rejoyceth my heart to see so many of your faces in my Auditory here, it will more rejoyce me, if I may see all those faces in Heaven at last; and truly I hope that many of you will be my Crown and Glory in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ; therefore it is that I preach,
<pb facs="tcp:49592:4"/>
therefore I have written these <hi>Words of Advice</hi> unto you, the chief heads of which are, 1. That you would <hi>seek First the Kingdom of God,</hi> where alone your chief happiness doth lye, as the End. 2. That you would <hi>seek the Righteousness of God,</hi> which is in his Son, that it might be imputed unto you for your Justification, and that it might be imparted unto you for your Renovation and Sanctification, as the necessary Means to attain this End, without which there is no possibility of admittance for you into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. 3. That (having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Grace in the truth of it) you would <hi>labour to grow in Grace,</hi> and to be strong therein, that you might be enabled both to do and suffer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God calleth you unto. 4. That you would <hi>get acquainted with the Word of God,</hi> and endeavour that it may abide and dwell in you richly, as the
<pb facs="tcp:49592:4"/>
choicest of all Treasures. 5. That you would <hi>labour to overcome the Wicked one, and all his temptations,</hi> whereby he would draw you unto sin, especially those sins which in Youth you are most inclinable unto.</p>
            <p>Beloved young men, you live in the dregs of times, in a wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched generation; take heed of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a multitude to do evil; save your selves from their <hi>sins,</hi> as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire God should save you from their <hi>punishments.</hi> Come out from amongst them, if you cannot in regard of your <hi>place,</hi> be sure to do it in regard of your <hi>course</hi> and <hi>practice;</hi> refrain too familiar converse with the wicked and profane; let your Companions be such as fear the Lord; walk in the way of Good Men; take that course as the most do that seem to be most serious, and to have their faces towards Heaven. I have endeavoured to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb facs="tcp:49592:5"/>
and remove the chief prejudices which are raised to discourage and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert from this way: You may safely and confidently venture into it, and walk in it, and you will finde (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the oppositions and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be therein) the end of it to be peace and happiness. The Lord grant that this Book may be a Means to keep you from sin, and help you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the way to Heaven, which is the desire and prayer of</p>

The subject of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, is many excellent Promises, Precepts, Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Cautions, Exhortations, backed with Motives and Arguments very needfull for the promotion of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Heart and Life. 1. Our Saviour gives several promises of blessedness both here and hereafter, to quicken his Disciples in their endeavours after some choice Graces and qualifications of minde, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

He declares the immutability and purity of the Moral Law, vindicating it from the corrupt and false glosses of the Pharisees, and explaining it in its spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reach and meaning. 4.

He exhorts them to lay up for themselves Treasures in Heaven, and not to be solicitous about the Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Life; which Exhortation he backeth with six Arguments. The first is drawn from the safety of Heavenly Treasures, being removed beyond the reach of <hi>rust, and moth, and thies:</hi> The second, from the uncertainty of earthly Treasures, which are in danger of being <hi>corrupted and stoln,</hi> v. 19. 20: The third from the inconsistency of the true love of God with the over-eager love of things here below, <hi>Ye cannot love God and Mammon,</hi> v. 24. The fourth from the assurance they might have that the Lord would, without their carking care, provide as much of these things as he saw needfull for them; and that by their experience 1. Of Gods goodness to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in things of a far greater moment, namely, in giving them <hi>life</hi> which was more than <hi>meat,</hi> and in giving them <hi>bodies</hi> which was more than <hi>raiment,</hi> v. 15. 2.

Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</hi> The Kingdom of Gods Power be sure is not here spoken of, some understand hereby the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Grace: But I rather think, that in this place the Kingdom of God is to be taken for the Kingdom of his Glory, where the chief and perfect happiness of men doth lye, which our Saviour would
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49592:7"/>
have them to seek, and not be sollicitous about earthly things which are so empty and transitory: And I the rather conceive that it is to be taken for the Kingdom of Glory, because the Kingdom of Grace which is the way to Glory, is included in the next word, namely, the <hi>righteousness</hi> of God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace,</hi> &amp;c. There is a twofold righteousness of God, 1. That righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which is imputed to us, whereby we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, called the <hi>righteousness of God by Faith,</hi> Phil. 3. 9. 2. That righteousness which is wrought in us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in regeneration, when we are <hi>renewed after the image of God in righteousness and true holiness,</hi> Eph. 4. 24. and in the work of Sanctification is more and more increased and augmented, whereby we grow in our spiritual stature, untill we come to a perfect man, to be perfectly righteous, even as Christ Is righteous. The Object then which we are to seek is the Kingdom of God, the Crown of glory, which God hath layd up for his people, the Happiness of Heaven as the End; and the righteousness of God, reconciliation to him, through the imputation of his Sons rightcousness; and conformity to him through the working inherent righteousness in us by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Spirit, as the way to this Kingdom, and necessary means to attain this end.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The second thing is to shew what it is to <hi>seek</hi> the Kingdom and Righteousness of God: and here two things are implyed, 1. <hi>A diligent Enquiry after these things.</hi> 2. <hi>A diligent endeavour in the use of means to obtain them.</hi>

1. A diligent enquiry after these things, and that both after the things and after the means; such as seek after this kingdom and righteousness, they first inform themselves in the nature, worth and need which they have of these things, and then diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inquire how they may get a part and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>terest in them: First, they enquire who will shew us the chief good? We see that the Creatures cannot yield us satisfaction, we cannot finde any perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat happiness upon the Earth, where shall we finde it? And being informed by the Word and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances that God is the chief good, that his favour is better than life, and that in his righteousness there is the beginning of true happiness, and in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there is perfection of happiness; that in his presence there is fulness and eternity of joy and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness, and that whilest they remain under the guilt and power of sin, they are under the Curse; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they obtain his righteousness, and a title to his Kingdom, they are in a lost estate, their condition for the present is miserable, and they are exposed every moment to be thrown into the dark and deep dungeon of Hell, where they shall be most horribly and eternally tormented; they further (being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of sin, and awakened with the fear of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) earnestly enquire how they may be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the estate of sin and misery, and be brought into a state of salvation; as the Jaylour, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 30. <hi>Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</hi> And being told that Christ only can save them from sin and wrath to come; they enquire how they may get an interest in Christ, and share in his righteousness; and being told of the Happiness in the <hi>Zion</hi> which is above, they enquire how they may get a title to the Kingdom of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49592:8"/>
Heaven, and ask the way to <hi>Zion</hi> with their faces thitherward, as the Church, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 5. Such as seek the Kingdom of God to purpose, they set their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> their hearts are set upon it, they are resolved to get it whatever it cost them; they ask the way not with their faces Hell-ward, as some do, but with their faces Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward, being resolv'd to submit to any terms; to make use of any means so they may obtain it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Seeking after Gods Kingdom and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, doth imply a diligent endeavour in the use of means (having found out what means are requisite) that they may obtain these things. Having found the Field where the Treasure is hid, there they dig that they may possess themselves of the treasure: Having found the Cabinet where the Jewel doth lye, they labour to open the Cabinet that they may get the Jewel: Having found the Shop, the Market where the Oyl is sold, they come to the place and buy: Being informed of a Scepter of grace held forth, they come and lay hold on it: Being informed of a Door of mercy, they come and knock, there they will lye, there they will crye, there they will dye, if they perish, they will perish in the use of means: Pray, hear, read, meditate, they will use any means, which God hath prescribed in his Word, though never so harsh and displeasing to flesh, and cross to their carnal interest: Though the use of power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full means may be hazzardous, though they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger Liberty, Estate, Life, they will not flirich and start aside out of Gods way to his Kingdom what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever enemies and opposition they meet withall therein; they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Master, from whose mouth the Word did first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: <hi>Seek, first the Kingdom and righteousnesse of God.</hi> There is a generation of old ones who are going off the stage of the world, and you are come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in their room; ere long they will lie down in the dust, and you not long since did spring out of it; they are almost come to their Journeys end, and you are setting forth on the way; they are even ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Port, and you are now putting forth to Sea. It is of the greatest concernment in the world to take and follow good advice at the first, before you are engaged too farr. Here therefore I shall put you in minde, that there are two wayes or passages in which all the children of men are travelling; the one is the way of sin, the other is the path of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: The way of sin is broad, an open, beaten road; you may easily know it by the multitude of Travellers, it is the course of the world. Your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents when they bring you into the world, set you down in this way; and many, yea most of them go before you in it: It appeareth to you the smoothest and fairest way; it may seem a delightfull way to you at the first, strewed with roses; such company, such enticements you may have in this way, as may render it most desireable, if you take Sense and Flesh for your guides and counsellers. But let me warn you before-hand that you walk not in this way, you will quickly finde the pleasur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49592:12"/>
and happiness you looked and hoped for it a sinfull course. It is a dangerous way; there ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of man to cure: It is the way which leadeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 14. It is the high road to Hell thither it will bring you: And if there be some sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual sweetness in the beginning of the way, think what bitterness there will be at the end thereof: Think how terrible Death will be unto you, after a life of sin: but think how dreadfull the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Hell will be when you are let thorow the gate of death, into that place of extream and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full torment.</p>
               <p>There is another way, namely the path of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, the way of Holiness, which is narrow and hath a strait gate; which you must go thorow, if you would get into it, namely the gate of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It is a way that is difficult to finde, tedious and irksome at first; it is a weeping and sorrowfull way at the entrance, few there be that finde it; most are discouraged by the narrowness and difficulty of it, from putting their feet into it: But it is the way of Life, it is the way to the Kingdom, it is the way of Peace, it is the way of God, it is the way to Heaven. The difficulty is chiefly at the first; the sorrows are mostly in the pangs of the New Birth, in conflicting for passage thorow the strait gate; weepin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If you walk steadily, you will finde it to be a way of such pleasure and delight, as you never did finde or can finde in the way of sin: And if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49592:12"/>
there should be clouds and rain, and stormy windes of trouble and temptation in the Journey, yet the latter end will be Peace; be sure there will be rest and happiness in the Kingdom into which death will convey your Souls after they are seperated from your Bodies; there you will finde <hi>fullness of joy, and pleasure for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that you have here Life and Death set before you; Heaven and Hell; eternal Happiness and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Misery: the latter at the end of the way of sin, and the former at the end of the way of Holiness. And which will you choose? if you will run with the wicked in the same excess of riot, if you will follow the multitude to do evil, if you will walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the course of the world, fulfilling the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of your flesh, and make provision for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of its lusts; you will be found at last in the number of the children of wrath, and the wrath of God will certainly come upon all such Children of disobedience: If you will live after the flesh, you shall die, you shall not escape the stroke of eternal death, you cannot avoid the damnation of Hell. But if you will turn your feet into the narrow path, and walk in the way of Obedience, which is the beginning of wisdom, if you will seek first the Kingdom of God, and his righteousness; you have a promise that God will provide for you whatever is needfull for you of temporal things, and in the end he will give you the Eternal Inheritance. Let me press upon you, <hi>dear young Men,</hi> the advice of the Text, to <hi>seek first the Kingdom and righteousness of God,</hi> seek the Kingdom of God as the <hi>end,</hi> and seek the Righteousness of God as the <hi>way and means.</hi>

Get a title to the Inheritance which is incorruptible and undefiled, and sadeth not away, which Jesus Christ hath purchased and prepared. Some young men addict themselves to the pleasures of the flesh, they are very jovial and frolick in their youth, walking in the wayes of their heart, and in the sight of their eyes, and very desirous of carnal delights, and sensual satisfactions; here are delights

and pleasures before you of a higher and purer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, more reall and substantial, more durable and lasting. The way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And if you would get a title to this Kingdom of God, and at length possession of it, you must,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Study the vanity and emptiness of all things here below; hearken to Reason, which will tell you so, because these things are unsuitable, unpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, uncertain, of a fading and perishing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Believe the report of the Word concerning the World and all things therein: <hi>Vanity of vanities saith the Preacher, all is vanity,</hi> Eccl. 1. 1. read that book throughout. Take the experience of others, who have tryed the world, and after the fullest and most desireable enjoyment of these things, have come off with dissatisfaction. Think how dangerous it will be for you to try: Let the Rocks which others have split themselves upon, be a warning to you to steer your course another way. Never look for, never seek happiness in the World; believe me, it is not there to be found. And therefore do not lay up your treasure on Earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Look into the Word, where <hi>life and immortality is brought to light;</hi> where the glory and happiness of Heaven, and the things which God hath there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them that love him, are in some measure revealed. Look into the Gospel, which like a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective-glass will give you some view of the glory which is above; there you may perceive that Heaven
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49592:14"/>
is a place of rest, of peace, of light, of joy, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and eternal happiness.</p>
                  <p>By the Word you may understand what happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is prepared for the Body, how gloriously that will shine, even like the Sun, and be made like Christs most beautifull and glorious body at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: There you may understand what glory will be put upon the Soul, what shining garments of Holiness it will be cloathed withall, and what Joyes of the Master it will be filled with.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Compare Earth and Heaven together in the ballance, and see which doth outweigh; whether the exceeding and eternal weight of glory be not more ponderous, than all the glory and happiness which the world can give, which indeed is not so much as the dust of the ballance to compare with it. And having made diligent enquiry and seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered and compared both these, then make your choice; the time of your Youth is the choosing time; renoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

gold; early grace hath a sweet fragrancy, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious lustre in it: The beauty of it doth then most shine, and the power of it doth then most appear, when young ones do deny themselves, and take up the Cross, and bear the yoak in their youth; when young ones do deafen their ears against all entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto pleasing sins, and break thorow the temptatious they meet withall, and with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of heart stick close unto God. This doth shew the power of grace, and tendeth much to Gods glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The time of young ones is longest which they have to glorifie God; when they seek and serve God betimes, they may not only escape many pollutions in the World wherewith other youths are defiled, to the dishonour of God, and the wounding of their own Consciences; but they may bring much glory to God in their generations. God hath work enough to employ them in (all tending to his glory and their good) thorowout the whole day of their lives, though they should begin in the Morning so soon as they can see, and work a whole and long Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers day, untill the night and darkness of old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepid years. I might instance in some of the works they are to be employed in; they have a pardon to sue out, evidences to clear, corruptions to mortifie, graces to get and improve, a treasure to lay up, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to resist, relations to fill; so many duties to perform to God, to Man: They may finde more work than time; Eternity-work is begun in this life. Now look, as a Master who driveth a great trade, is best pleased with those servants who rise most early, and are most diligent in his business; so God who hath so much work for his people, is best
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49592:17"/>
pleased with young persons, who seek him early and diligently.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>The time of Youth is most seasonable for all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You must get your <hi>heart broken for sin,</hi> if ever you would enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; you must mourn for sin here, or weep for sin for ever; you must sowe in tears, if you would reap in joy. The time of youth is most seasonable for this; your sorrow is like to be loss heavy, and more kindly: The heart hath a natural hardness, but if it hath
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49592:17"/>
got a contracted hardness, it will with more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be broken, if ever it be broken: Custom in sin will take away sense of sin; and if you continue in the practice of sin, you will feel a senselesness and stupidity grow upon your spirit; and Conscience more tender and timorous at first, by degrees will grow feared as with a hot Iron, and be past feeling. Bring your hearts therefore now under the hammer of the Word, that they may be broken; the longer you deferre, the harder you will finde it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You must get your <hi>hearts broken from sin;</hi> you must turn from your evil wayes, otherwise ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity will be your ruine. The longer you continue in sin, the harder it will be to leave sin; custom will be a second nature to you; the changing whereof will be like changing the skin of the <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> and taking away the spots of the Leopard. When sin is rooted and riveted in you, if so be you should turn from it, it will be with unexpressible tearings, and divulsions of spirit. It is a hard thing to irradicate old habits, which at first in the tender years may be done with more ease: Therefore, <hi>Dear young ones,</hi> labour to get sin rooted out of your hearts betimes. Get sin mortified before it hath got too much life and strength; oppose sin before it hath got too much head and power, which you may do with more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and success.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You must open your hearts and <hi>give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto Christ,</hi> if you ever expect to have the gate of Heaven opened unto you, and to be entertained by Christ in his Kingdom. Such as shut the door of their hearts against Christ when they are young, will finde (if Christ doth not withdraw, and leave
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49592:18"/>
knocking) that the door will be faster bolted and barred within against him; the longer you hold it out, the more will Sathan strengthen the Fort against Christ, and more easily beat off whatever assaults are made upon you by the Word and Spirit. Christ will come in most willingly to them that open to him presently; and the match will quickly be made up, if in youth you hearken to the motion. Let me beseech you, therefore, <hi>my dearly beloved young ones,</hi> to open the door to Christ without any further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; by me he standeth now and knocketh for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; what answer shall I return, that you have harboured lusts there, where his lodging should be, and would not part with them? that you put me off till a further day, untill you had a little longer tasted the sweets of sin: O take heed of such carriage of heart towards Christ, <hi>Qui non est hodie, cras minus aptus erit,</hi> if you be not willing to open to Christ now, you will be more unwilling to morrow: do it then presently; may I be instrumental to joyn the Lord Jesus Christ and you together in marriage; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into your hearts, and accept of him, to love, honour, and obey him, and do it heartily and resolvedly, and he is yours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You must get your <hi>hearts furnished with grace,</hi> if ever you hope to share in the glory of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Grace is glory in the seed, and glory is grace in the flower; grace is glory in the root, glory is grace in the fruit; grace is glory in the first-fruits, glory is grace in the harvest: You must get the seed sown, the root planted, or no flower, no fruit, no harvest is to be expected; you must get the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Gods grace within you, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 21. if ever you would be admitted into the Kingdom of his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49592:18"/>
glory. And the time of youth is the most seasonable time for the getting of grace; no time like the Spring for setting of this Plant of grace in the heart; in the youth the heart is more plyable, and like the yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wax more ready to receive the impressions of the Spirit.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Your danger is in respect of the uncertainty of Gods working by the Means, though he should continue them unto you; the winde blowes where and when it listeth. In youth you may feel the sweet breath of the Spirit moving upon your hearts; if you do not hoist up sail when you have a fair wind, possibly you may never have such a winde again as long as you live, God may swear in his wrath that his Spirit shall no longer strive with you, God calleth upon you when you are young, if you refuse, you may hereafter call, and cry, and seek, and knock, and not be heard or answered, and the door be shut up against you for ever. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. to the 31. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Zacb.</hi> 7. 11, 12, 13. We read of <hi>Esau's</hi> weeping for the blessing to no purpose; and the foolish Virgins going to buy Oyl when it was too late; and our Saviour telling <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that their day was spent, and the things which belonged to their peace were hid from their eyes. There are many that neglect the things of Gods Kingdom when they are young, that have their day of grace set upon them, before their lives be half spent; God doth leave off calling, and the Spirit doth leave off working, and they are given up to a judiciall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

Better miscarry in any business than in this business; better miss of an Estate, than miss of Gods Kingdom; better be a poor begger than remain a guilty sinner; better the body be cloathed with rags, than the soul be without the white robes of Christs Righteousness; better the body were starved, than to have the soul damned; the greatest poverty and misery in this life which can befall you, is not to be compared with the eternal misery of Hell, which in the neglect of the duty of the Text you cannot escape.

You are in a Sea as it were, where there are waves of trouble beating upon you, a tide of inward corruptions working against you, and a boisterous winde of temptation to carry you back; you had need to row hard, if you will get to the Haven.

Young men, labour for strength of <hi>Faith:</hi> some of you have strong bodies, others have strong memories, others have strong fancies; labour all of you to get a strong faith. Faith is an excellent grace, it is more precious than gold, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. labour to get faith, and a strong faith. <hi>Abraham</hi> was strong in faith, and hereby he brought glory to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. shew your selves to be children of faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> by getting such a faith as he had for kinde, and such a faith as he had for measure; this will be for Gods glory and for your honour. Let your faith have a strong bottom, a firm and sure footing; build it not upon the sand, or earth, much less upon the waters, but build it upon the Rock, upon the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Rock of Ages; build it upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Jesus Christ being the chief corner-stone; build it upon the Word of God in the Scriptures, and build it upon Christ who is held forth in the Word. Let your faith have a strong bottom, and let your faith put forth it self in strong actings; let your assent be

strong unto divine Truths; and let your recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance be strong upon Christ and the Promises of the Gospel. Get a strong eye of Faith to discern those spiritual objects which cannot be seen with the eye of sense, to look upward to God, and the glory which is about his Throne, to look downward to Hell, and the torments which the damned do there endure for sin, to look forward to the coming of Christ, and the general Judgement of the World at his appearance; and get a strong hand of faith to lay fast hold on Christ, to apply his righteousness for the remission of sin, and to receive his Spirit for the cleansing you from filthiness, and perfecting holiness which is begun in you. Let your trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be strong in God through his Son: Young men are apt to be too credulous, too ready to believe and put confidence in men, when the Scripture telleth us, that all men are Lyars, if not actually so, yet they may be so, and the most are so; young ones before they have tryed the world are apt to trust in men, old ones that are more experienced, are more cautious; but you cannot put too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God; he cannot lye, he never deceived any, he never will fail them that put their trust in him. Some trust in Chariots, and some in Horses, but let your trust be in the Lord; some trust in Princes and great persons, others in Hosts and strong Forces, most in arms of flesh, which are weak, and cannot give that help as is expected; but let your confidence be in the Name of the Lord, who is a shield and buckler, and present help to his people in the time of trouble; whose Name is a strong.

Be strong in Faith, according to the strength of this grace, all your other graces will receive strength, Faith being the Nurse of them all.</p>

37, 38. God commandeth you to love him, it is your duty; God alloweth you to love him, it is your priviledge; God doth chiefly require your love; <hi>My Son, give me thy heart.</hi> If you give any thing, every thing you have besides, and keep back your heart, it will not be accepted: And God doth best deserve your love; he is the most suitable object for your love; other objects will debase your love, God will ennoble and dignifie your love: you cannot bestow your love better; none so amiable as God, especially as he represents himself in his Son: If you look for greatness, he is the most great and glorious Majesty of Heaven and Earth: If you look for power, he is Omnipotent, hath done, and can do whatever he pleaseth: If wisdom hath a beauty in it in your esteem, his understanding and wisdom is infinite: If truth, faithfulness, mercy, goodness be amiable in your eyes, he is truth it self, and cannot lye; he is full of mercy and kindness, he hath most tender bowels, he hath riches and treasures of grace and goodness: If love be an attractive of love, his love is beyond comparison, beyond conception; there is a heighth in his love which cannot be reached; a depth in his love which cannot be fathomed; a breadth and length in his love, which cannot be comprehended; his love is first, without any beginning; his love is free, without our deserving; his love is constant, without any changing; his love is eternal, without any ending: He is most lovely, this should draw forth your love much; he is most loving, this should draw forth your love more; he is love it self, 1 J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

should this be to your love! whither are your hearts wandring? O gather in all your scattcred affections, and fix them upon this most beautiful object! place your love upon God now, before it be too far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to something else, from whence it may be very difficult to withdraw; love him with all your heart; love him truly, and love him strongly; love him sincerely, and love him servently; love him supream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and love him constantly; let the fire of your love ascend to him, as to its sphere; let the stream of your love run to him, and lose it self in the Ocean of his goodness, where alone it can finde suitableness and satisfaction; here you may bathe your selves without fear of drowning; here you may expatiate without fear of exceeding; here you can never transgress the bounds of love; love him strongly whom you can never love too strongly. Be strong in love <hi>one to another;</hi> you may love one another, and you ought to love one another; love is the summ of the Law, the first Table is fulfilled in love to God; the second Table is fulfilled in love to your neighbour. See how the Apostle expresseth it, <hi>Kom.</hi> 13. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Owe na man any thing, but to love one another; for be that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: And if there be any other Commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, Thou shalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy self. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> There is a common love which you should bear to all, even to the wicked and your enemies, which should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with-hold you from offering any injury unto them, or rendring evil for evil; but also should put

The Book of the Holy Scriptures is the most excellent Book that ever was written: It is the Book of God. If an Angel should write a book, I believe you would get and study such a book, were you capable of understanding it; much more should you study the Scripture, which is of Divine Inspiration. This is Gods Book, and his only written Book: there are not many Books of God to burden your memory; you may read it over many times in your Life; it is translated into your Mother-tongue, that you may read it; and it is written for the most part in a plain easie style, that you may understand it: and it is full of most excellent matter:</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Word of God is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. In the Word you have the highest Doctrines, concerning God, his one Nature in thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e Persons; concerning Christ, his two Natures in one Person; concerning the Church, the mystical union of Christ the head, and all Believers his members; concerning mans Redemption by Christs death; concerning the way of mans salvation by the Covenant of Grace, and the like. Look into all the writings of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers and the wisest Heath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

What are all the Arts and Sciences in the World? what are the most subtle speculations, the most accurate and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional discourses concerning the secrets and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Nature, in which the most knowing have been puzzled, and fallen short of a full understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in comparison with the Doctrine of the Word, and the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, which are revealed in the Scriptures?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>History</hi> of the Word is most excellent: In the Word you have the History of the Creation; the history of the Old World; the history of the Flood; the history of the burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49592:32"/>
with Fire and Brimstone from Heaven, the history of Gods calling <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patriarchs, the history of Gods bringing the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with many signs and wonders, through the Red Sea and Wilderness, into the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; the history of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Paedagogy, and Gods various dealings with his Church before Christ came; but especially you have the history of Christ; his birth, his life, his works, his death, his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, his ascension, his session, and intercession at the right hand of God; the history of the first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Gentile Church by the Apostles, their preaching and success, and the like: Look into all the Historians which have written, and where shall you finde such an history as is in the Scriptures? Surely there is no history like to the history of the Bible for antiquity, for certainty; no history in which you have such concernment as in this history; you may read of the memorable acts of some great Princes and famous Captains, which may yield some pleasure to your fancy, but you are never the better or the worse for what hath been done by these men so many years ago; but you are concerned in the history of the Church, in the history of Christ the Saviour of the World, your salvation and happiness doth depend upon his birth, and death, and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and appearance in Heaven to intercede for you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Prophesie</hi> of the Word is most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; not to say any thing of Prophesies already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled concerning the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Old Testament, concerning the First appearance of Jesus Christ foretold long before: In the Word you have Prophesie concerning the calling of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49592:33"/>
destruction of Antichrist, the bringing in the fulness of the Gentiles; which yet we are in expectation of. Especially you have prophecy of the end of the World, of the conclusion of Time, and of what God will do with the children of men when Time, and all the by-us-visible-place shall be no more. You have prophecy of the second most glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Jesus Christ to Judgement, of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which shall be inflicted upon all the ungodly in Hell; of the Reward which shall be given unto the righteous in Heaven: This is a great and most sure, and most excellent Prophecy. Some men have taken upon them to foretell future things, and have been foully mistaken; and what they have foretold have been but of small moment in comparison: This Prophecy of the Word is most sure, because the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of God, who knoweth all future things, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is omniscient, and all things depend upon his decree. And these things he hath foretold are of the greatest weight of any other things which he hath made known before-hand to us, that we might prepare for that which is asar off.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Word are most excellent. It would be too large to discourse of the Precepts in the Moral Law, and the sweet commands of the Gospel, where you have such admirable rules for the government of the thoughts, heart, affections, speech, behaviour, and whole conversation, as are not to be found in the Books of the most exact Moralist that ever wrote.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Promises</hi> of the Word are most excellent. Promises of all temporal things needfull; Promises of spiritual favours; promises of eternal happiness; promises suitable to all our wants; promises precious,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49592:33"/>
of things of the greatest value; Promises free, without condition of merit; Promises sure, of a God who is most powerful and most faithful. The matter then of this Word of God is most excellent; therefore young ones be perswaded to study this Word; let this Word of God abide in you.</p>

And that you may do so, I would advise you to take a right method herein, that you would begin with the Principles of Religion. One that would have a good understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Tongues, must first learn the Grammar: One that would attain knowledge in the Art and Sciences, must begin first with the Principles, the Rudiments and Elements of them: And so one that would attain a good understanding in the Word of God, must begin with the Principles of Religion, which are collected together in the most easie way to understand in Catechisms, where you have the great fundamental truths of Religion, which are necessary to be known, believed and practised in order unto salvation, set down by way of question and answer. And because some Catechisms are very deficient in giving clear light, and some are very full: I shall above all commend to you the Catechism of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Divines, where all the heads of Religion are proved out of the Scripture, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49592:34"/>
and foundation of all: and I would have you first to learn the shorter Catechism exactly, with the proofs; then proceed to the larger Catechism and consession of faith; and as you go along, labour to understand the meaning of every thing you learn; and not only to get a notional understanding, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a spiritual discerning, and to mingle these great truths with faith, to receive and believe what you finde proved by the Scripture to be the Word of God, and therefore most firmly to assent to them. For this end you must look up to the Lord, and make your prayer to him, that he would give you his Spirit to teach and lead you into all truth. Besides learning Catechisms, you must keep a constant course of reading some portion of Scripture every day, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to carry about with you something of the Word in your minds, which you may entertain your thoughts withall, when you get them off from other business.</p>

If you make shipwrack of faith and a good conscience, you will make shipwrack of your souls upon the rocks of perdition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and be drowned in the Ocean of Gods wrath: Therefore you must earnestly contend for the Faith, that is the Doctrine of Faith, the Truths of the Word once delivered unto the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 4.

Let not the Truth hang loose in your minds, lest it be snatched away from you, but get the Truth girt; get it fastned and fixed; get it rooted and riveted, that you may not be wavering like a wave of the Sea tossed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a mind established in the Truths of the Word.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

3. That you cannot avoid sorrow, if you should continue in the way of sin, pride crossed, the world failing, afflictions unexpected coming upon you, which are born with chearfulness by the children of God, may be heart-breaking to you; one time or other you will have sorrows in a sinfull course; and is it not better to have godly sorrow which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth repentance unto salvation, than the sorrow of the world and lust which worketh death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That if you can obtain a kindly sorrow for sin, which is a sweet melting of the heart with the sense of Gods love, you will find more pleasure to your inward man than ever you did in all the delights of sin.</p>

That you are not required in this way to throw away all your comforts in your creature-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, but only to deny your selves the excess and inordinacy, which where it is taken, breeds more bitterness in the disappointment, than ever it yielded sweetness unto any: You may take a subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate comfort in friends, and habitation, and food, and the like, and herein more reall comfort through the sweetning of these things with Gods blessing and love, than ever you could finde in these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

               <p>Sin in its own nature is so black and odious, that if your eyes were but opened to see what dishonour it reflecteth upon the pure and holy God, and how it defileth your own Souls once made after the image of God; you could not choose but loath and abhorr it, and with hatred you would flye from it as from a Pestilential disease, or venemous Serpent, and no arguments would perswade you to commit it, or give it any room or harbour in your hearts; therefore the wicked one doth use the greatest art and cunning to paint and colour over sin with fair
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49592:43"/>
glosses, that the monstrous nature and deadly poyson of it might be hid from your eyes and knowledge.</p>
               <p>And as God hath his methods in the conversion of young ones, and useth many arguments by his Ministers and Spirit, to perswade them unto the practice of Religion: So Satan hath his methods and arguments to draw away young ones from God unto the commission of sin, and continuance therein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first work of God upon young Converts, is Illumination of the Understanding, he opens their eyes to see their sin and misery, the way of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ, the beauty and excellency of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so on the contrary, Sathan the wicked one, called <hi>the God of this World,</hi> doth endeavour to blind the eyes of young ones, to keep them in the dark, that the light of the glorious Gospel might not shine upon them, to discover either their sin or their Saviour; and he endeavoureth to stir up in them a hatred of the light, that so they might sin without reproof, or controul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second work of God upon young Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, is Contrition, he awakens their Consciences, filleth them with fears and terrours through appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of his anger, and the dreadfull wrath that hangs over them, and they know not how soon may fall down upon them, and sink them into the lowest Hell for their sin, that hereby they being terrified, may apply themselves without any delay unto the Lord Jesus Christ, the only Saviour of mankind: So on the contrary, the wicked one doth labour to still and calm, and quiet the Consciences of young ones under the guilt of their sins; to lull them fast asleep, and keep them from all disturbances, from an
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49592:43"/>
unquiet Conscience, which if awakened, would plead the cause of God against sin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third work of God upon young Converts, is a powerfull bending and enclining the Will to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Jesus Christ as their Saviour and Advocate, and to resign up it self in full complyance with his will in every thing: So the wicked one doth endeavour to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="4">4. A fourth work of God upon young Converts, is upon their heart and affections, whereby he draweth them and engageth them for himself: So on the contrary, the wicked one is very busie in tampering with the affections of young ones; and as God doth use arguments in effecting a gracious change upon young Converts, so the wicked one doth use arguments to perswade them unto the practice of siń; which arguments are his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. He laboureth to hide from them the sting and bitterness of sin, the sorrow and vexation which it will certainly produce in the conclusion; he covereth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49592:44"/>
the hook out of their sight, laboureth to divert their thoughts from all serious considerations of the gall and wormwood that is in the bottom of the cup.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He represents the delights of sin as most sweet and satisfying; as present and at hand, and easie to be had without difficulty and labour; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as secret too, which no mortal eye can take notice of.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He joyneth in with the lusts of their hearts, with which he hath a secret correspondence, and proposeth such objects unto them as are most suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and desireable. It is by the pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of sin that most young men are bewitched and perswaded to the commission of it. It was by the pleasantness of the forbidden fruit that this Old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent enticed our first Parents to eat thereof, and hereby it is that he doth entice their posterity.</p>
                     <p>Dear young men, labour to overcome this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wicked one, by the delight and pleasure of sin, by taking into your most serious thoughts these few Considerations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Consider, that all the pleasures of sin are low, mean, empty, thin, unsatisfying pleasures; they are sensual and br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>te, but they cannot satisfie your rational souls, they may satiate and glut the senses, but they cannot content the heart: The Devil and lust may promise full satisfaction and contentment, if you will commit such and such sins, but they alwaies fall short in the performance. I would ask these three questions of the most luxurious persons. 1. Whether
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49592:45"/>
ever they found so much pleasure in any sin as they expected and desired? 2. Whether the choicest of their pleasures have not in a short time brought a weariness and trouble upon their spirits? 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this weariness and trouble hath not been more irksome and grievous to them, than their sensual pleasures have been pleasing and delightful? yea let me add a fourth: If amongst the choicest and chiefest of their delights in which thev finde most sweetness, they had but one delight without change and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, whether that delight would not quickly lose its nature, and prove a torment to them? If they were bound alwaies to eat, or continually to drink. or without intermission to be alwaies in the act of adultery, would not this be more bitter than sweet? These pleasures are unsatisfying; the soul can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with nothing beneath the enjoyment of God, by whom, and for whom it was made.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Consider the shortness of these pleasures: The Apostle calleth them pleasures of sin for a season, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25. And as he saith of some meats, that they perish in the using, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 22. so some pleasures they perish in the enjoying; the enjoyment of them doth put a period unto them; and those that are most durable, they quickly flit away as a cloud or vapour, which if not blown away by the wind, they vanish of their own accord: If the stormy wind of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction do not puff out the candle of wicked mens joy, yet the daies of old age are drawing on, in which they shall say, They have no pleasure in them, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 1. Death be sure will sweep them all away; there will be no sinful pleasures in the other world.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Consider the sting of the pleasures of sin, which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49592:45"/>
is not in the mouth, but in the tail: Grief and wounds, and piercing sorrows, will be the issue of sin: Sin hath a far differing aspect in the temptation before it is committed, and in the reflection after it is committed, especially when they begin to be plagued for it: In the temptation sin lookerh fair and beautiful, and with a pleasant countenance; but in the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>flection it is black, grizly and terrible: Hence it is that wicked men who can delight themselves so much in the fore-thoughts of sin when they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed unto it, yet cannot endure to look back on sin with fore-thoughts of the account they must give unto God for it. Sin, though never so pleasant, will in a short time produce more bitterness a thousand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, than ever it did yield sweetness. Besides, the lashes and stings of conscience which sensualists some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have in their secret retirements; how are they (if any thing awakened) at their latter end even ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly consum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

O the tearings that they will feel of the never-dying Worm, when they are clapt in the dark dungeon of Hell, where they will be under the immediate impression of the wrath of the sin-revenging God! If sensualists did but believe, and seriously consider the pains which they must endure in body and soul for ever for their sinful pleasures, it would quench their desires after them. If the Drunkard did see <hi>Dives;</hi> instead of his bowls and goblets of rich wine, begging for a drop of water to cool his tongue, surely they would sooner drink poison, than drink unto excess: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="2">2. That the Holiness of God is his most glorious Attribute, and therefore sin which is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site hereunto can have no real glory in it, therefore sin is the only abominable thing which he hateth, therefore he lightly esteemeth, he looketh upon afar off, he scorneth and despiseth, he loatheth and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth all the workers of iniquity.</p>

                     <p>But what necessity is there of sin, to get the good things of this life? Duty is necessary to all, but sin is never necessary to any. There is one thing neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, to get an interest in Christ, and lay up the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in Heaven; but it is not necessary to commit any sin to get provisions for the body and family; yea, it is dangerous and destructive: Sin, whatever ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity is pretended, will bring ruine and damnation upon such as live in the practice of it: Better starve the body, than damn the soul; better the body should drop presently into the pit of the grave through want, than that the soul should drop into the pit of Hell through sin: A man had better be without meat or drink, without house or friend; yea, he had better lose his life a thousand times, if it were possible, than to live in the practice of any known sin, though all these might be preserved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; because the gain of all these, yea of the whole world, cannot countervail the loss of the soul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 26.

                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:49592:48"/>
But dear young men, be not overcome by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the smalness of sin, considering,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That no sin is little or small in its own nature; Though some sins have more venome in them than others, yet all are of a poisonous nature: Some sins are greater, but all are great; all are the breaches of the Law of the great, the infinite Majesty of Heaven and Earth; and that which hath an infinite object cannot be small. <hi>Est eadem ratio rotundi in nummulo exiguo, quae est in magno,</hi> there is the same reason of roundness in a small piece of money, as in the greatest: and there is the same reason of sin in small sins, that there is in the most heinous, because it is committed against the same Law of the same God. See <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10, 11. <hi>Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>soever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a transgressor of the Law.</hi> Though you should refrain some sins, yet if you venture to commit others, though they be less sins, and allow your selves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, you break the Law of the same God, and are under the guilt and power of sin, and as equally liable to the punishment of sin, as those which live in the practice of those which are most notorious: And let me tell you, that it is as hard to get a pardon for those sins which you call small ones, as for the greatest; God can as easily pardon the one as the other; the smallest sins require the infinite mercy of God, and the infinite merits of Christ for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; therefore no sin is in it self small.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Consider, is the thing but small which you are tempted unto? this in some respect aggravateth the offence, if you yield to the temptation: A man that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49592:49"/>
will forfeit the favour of his Prince, or friend, for a small thing, it argueth a great slighting of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: So the least wilful sin argueth a great slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the favour of God, which hereby is forfeited. <hi>Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not encrease thy wealth by their price,</hi> saith the Psalmist, when he apprehended that God took little regard to his people, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. 12. So may I say on the contrary, when you will offend God for a small thing, you do, as it were, sell your God for nought, and what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will you get hereby? It was the saying of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 26. <hi>What shall it profit a man if be gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? And what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi> Much more may I say; What shall it profit a man, if he should gain the whole world, and lose his God? and what can a man give in exchange for God, who is the chief good, and in whom doth consist our chiefest happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? But if you will lose or exchange your God for nought, for a trifle, by little sins, this, as it argueth great folly; so it is a great aggravation of sin.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3.</hi> Consider that the least sin which you allow your selves in the practice of, is sufficient to damn your souls. A small leak in a ship unstopped, will quickly let in water enough to drown the ship, though not so soon as the greatest breach. A prick with a pin in the heart, will as surely kill a man, as a wound with a sword: So the least sin unrepented of, will as surely shipwrack and destroy the soul, as the greatest and most heinous osfences. The Law curseth and condemneth every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them, <hi>Gal. 3.</hi> 10. And such as lie under the curse cannot inherit the blessing. Let not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49592:49"/>
any think then to get to Heaven, who allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the practice of the least sins; who make no conscience of petty oaths, officious lyes, idling away their precious time, and the like, which are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed small and trivial things by the men of the world.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Consider, though the wicked one seemeth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and shamefac't in his first temptations in asking but little things, yet he will not rest there, but by degrees will proceed further, and hereby bring you unto the commission of greater. As the habits of grace, so the habits of sin are strengthened by degrees; though the beginning be but small, yet within a little while sin will greatly encrease. Rivers at first arise from small springs, which in running gather wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and encrease into a great stream: So actual sins (I speak not of original sin, which is a deep and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable fountain, from whence actual sin doth arise, and by which it is fed) I say, actual sins in their first beginning are but small, which if a man alloweth himself in the practice of, they will swell and encrease, and carry him with a strong stream towards the Ocean of Gods wrath; if you make no conscience of small sins, you will easily be tempted to those which are great and more notorious. First, Satan will propose sin to your thoughts, it is no great thing to think; and if you can dally with sin in your thoughts, then he will by delightful pleasing thoughts of sin lay siege to your will; it is no great matter to desire, if you do not act; then if the fort of the will be taken, all the under-forts of the affections will quic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>y yield; and when you have entertained sin in your hearts, you will be tempted to proceed further, to vent it at your lips; it is no great thing to speak, and then, as you
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49592:50"/>
have opportunity, he will tempt you to practice; go a little further, the sin is sweet, try but once, put but one step into this way, and retire again as soon as you will; and when once you have committed the act, it may be with smitings and reluctance of conscience, then he will entice again; it cannot be much worse, try once again, and by degrees the reluctance wears off; and though you commit sin at first with more regret, yet afterwards you will do it with more ease and delight; yea, with greediness and resolution, with hardness and obstinacy; and one great sin will make way for the commission of more; so that in time you will not forbear the greatest sins. <hi>Nemo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentè fit turpissimus,</hi> no man arriveth to the highest degree of wickedness upon a sudden, but is step by step drilled on by the Devil, and his own hearts lusts from little sins to the greatest. By degrees Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence is more lessened, the will more enclined, the conscience more seared, the habits of sin more strengthened, the Devil more encouraged, and so way is made for any sin. Lesser Commandments (saith one) are a hedge about the greatest; if by small sins you break down this hedge, you will quickly make breaches upon the greater too: Smaller sins many times will engage you to commit greater, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and defend them; the least link in a chain will draw the greatest after it. If you would be kept from great sins, you must take heed of the first beginnings, <hi>obsta principiis, &amp;c.</hi> A small wound in the body, if it be not looked after, may fester and gangrene, and endanger the life: So small sins, if not stopt and healed, will breed a gangrene in the spirit, and bring certain death and destruction. If you do not resist the beginnings of sin, it will be hard to make head
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49592:50"/>
against it afterwards, when it hath got more strength: It will be as hard to leave off a custom of sin, which will be a second nature, as for the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> to change his skin, or the Leopard his spots. <hi>Non obtinebis ut desinant, si in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Dear Youths, take heed then of small sins, resist the first motions and temptations to sin, crush sin in the first rising of it, delight not in the thoughts of it: Keep your hearts, guard your senses if you would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this temptation of the wicked one.</p>

Cards may well be termed the Devils Books, and Dice the Devils Game; look not into those books, though they have no sense in them, yet they will strangely bewitch you to spend hours and nights together in turning them over: Throw not away your time with the Dye, you can never recover what you lose, I mean your precious time; not to say any thing of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger you will be in of spending all you have, as some who have been worth many thousand pounds at night, have not been worth a thousand pence by the morning.

Be not enticed to this sin by Friends; be not perswaded to it by custome; if you will do as the most do, you must go where the most goe, and that is to Hell. Think, if you lay upon your death bed, whether this sin of Gaming would not trouble you; and whether those will not have more peace, that our of Conscience have forborn to touch a Card or Dye all their life-time.</p>

Be not proud of gifts of mind, much less of strength and beauty of body, and least of all, of hair, which is but an excrement, or of clothes, which are a badge of mans Apostacy. Remember that pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall: That God looketh upon the proud afar off, when he hath a respect to the lowly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. 6. That God resisteth the proud, when he giveth grace to the humble, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 6.</p>

15. Young men, take heed <hi>of Gensoriousness,</hi> of rash judging of others. Take the caution of our Saviour against this sin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Judge not that ye be not judged, for with what judgement ye judge ye shall be judged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers, eye, and considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</hi> If you censure others, you will be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured again; be sure ye will be judged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by God; you are apt to spy little faults, motes in others, be acquainted with the beam in your own eye, with your own greater faults, and you will not then be so forward to judge. Take one more Scripture, which cautioneth you against this sin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 11, 12. <hi>Speak not evil one of another; he that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the Law, and judgeth the Law.</hi> He doth in effect say, that the Law which condemneth this sin, is not so fit a Law. <hi>But if thou judge the Law, thou art not a doer of the Law, but a Judge. There is one Law-giver, who is able to save and to destroy? Who art thou that judgest another?</hi>

               <p n="16">16. Young men, take heed of <hi>Procrastinating, your Repentance.</hi> Do not put off this great work until to morrow; remember what hazards you run; how uncertain life is; how unlikely that ever you should repent, if you do not improve your youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful season for it. Set about the work presently, break off your sins by repentance presently, and make
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49592:59"/>
your peace with God without further delay, left you be cut off from the Land of the living before you are aware, and hereafter there will be no room for repentance.</p>

                  </gap>, and never tasted the bitter cup of Affliction; and therefore may be apt to be secure, and secretly hope that this state will last, that your Mountain is so strong, that you shall never be moved, that you shall never come into Adversity. Alas! you are little acquainted with the World; Man is born to trouble as the sparks flye upwards; crosses, and cares, and losses, and sickness, and pain, and many miseries are the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of this Life; and you must look sooner or later, in one measure or other, to have your share: be not secure, but prepare, lest being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided, the miseries of this life be more irksome and unsupportable.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Young men, take heed <hi>of carnal Confidence.</hi> You may be apt now to put your trust in Arms of flesh, to repose much confidence in Friends or Means, and some external props; but you will finde them all like broken reeds, or a foot out of joynt; and where you have the greatest hope and trust, you are like to meet with the greatest disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: Cease then from Man, whose breath is in his nostrils; trust not in uncertain riches; stay not upon any Creature, but put your trust in the Lord, who is omnipotent and faithfull; in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49592:60"/>
him you may be secure as to the greatest evil, and you may have confidence of all needfull sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Young men, take heed <hi>of Rashness.</hi> Be not rash in your Promises, lest you repent, or be found unfaithfull: Be not rash in your Undertakings, in your engagement in any business; especially take heed of rashness in changing your condition. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Proverb, <hi>That Youth rideth post to be married, and lodgeth in the Inne of Repentance.</hi> In all the weighty affairs of your life, Pray to God earnestly for his guidance; consult with wise and faithfull friends; and seriously deliberate things in your own mindes. Observe the rule of the Word, and let your design be the glory of God.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And lastly, young men, take heed <hi>of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steadfastness.</hi> Be not inconstant in your resolutions as to civil affairs and undertakings; but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take heed of inconstancy and unstedfastness in the wayes of God. Take heed of a wavering, unsettled minde, of backslidings and revoltings from God, let not your Zeal degenerate into Lukewarmness, and your present Forwardness end in Apostacy. But watch, stand fast in the Faith, quit your selves like men, be strong, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 13. and with full purpose of heart stick close unto the Lord, <hi>Au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 11. 23.</p>
               <p>Labour to keep your selves from these sins of Youth which the wicked one would draw you unto, that so you may be victorious, and if you overcome, you shall eat of the tree of Life which

is in the Paradise of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7. You shall not be hurt of the second death, v. 11. You shall eat of the hidden Manna, and have the white stone, wherein the new Name is written, which none-can read but they that receive it, v. 17. You shall have the Morning Star, v. 28. You shall be cloathed in White Raiment, and Christ will confess your Name before his Father, and before the Angels, <hi>ohap.</hi> 3. 5. You shall be Pillars in the Temple of God, and go no more out, and have the Name of God written upon you, v. 12. You shall sit with Christ on his throne, as he overcame, and is set down with his Father on his throne, v. 21.</p>
