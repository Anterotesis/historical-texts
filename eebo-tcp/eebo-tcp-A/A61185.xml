            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True ACCOUNT OF THE Horrid Conspiracy Against the Late KING, His Present MAJESTY, And the <hi>GOVERNMENT.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE KING has thought fit to lay open, and to declare to the World, An Exact Account of the late Accursed Conspiracy, which was actually form'd, and carried on in <hi>England,</hi> and set on foot in <hi>Scotland,</hi> against His own, and his only and dearest Brothers Life, and against the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Flourishing Government of His Majesties Kingdoms; as far forth, as hitherto the Particulars of it have come to His Knowledge, by the Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Confessions, or undeniable Convictions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Principal Conspirators.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:44330:5"/>
By thus faithfully representing the plain Matter of Fact, though perhaps all the Groundless Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions, and Malicious Insinuations of Factious Men, will not be wholly put to silence; it being their old, and constant Artifice, to support, and incourage their Party, by Impudent Slanders and Falshoods, against the clearest Light, and most evident Proof: Yet however His Majesty will have the Satisfaction hereby to confirm the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and good Affections of all His loving Subjects at Home, and to establish Abroad the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Honour of His Royal Justice.</p>
            <p>And moreover (which His Majesty most of all regards) this Publick, and Lasting Testimony will be given of His sincere Thankfulness to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, for that Miraculous Deliverance from a Danger, which came so near His Sacred Person, and was so far spread in the Ruine, it threaten'd to all His People.</p>
            <p>It is well known, what mischievous Arts of late Years have been used, and what Treasonable Courses taken, to withdraw these Nations from their bounden Duty and Allegiance, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose His Majesties most Just, and Merciful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to Calumny and Contempt: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Design having been apparently carried on by all sorts of Male-contents; whom either their Crimes, or Wants, their furious Zeal, or unbounded Ambition, inclined to wish for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of the Peace, and Prosperity, which His Majesties Dominions have so long injoy'd, to the Envy of all His Neighbours.</p>
            <p>To this wicked purpose, many the very same fatal Methods and specious Pretences, which, in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44330:5"/>
the Days of his Majesties Glorious Father, had involved these Kingdoms in Confusion and Blood, were once again revived, and by many the very same Persons; Men of crafty, restless, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Spirits; impenitent after the most Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pardons; whom long Experience had made skilful in seducing weak, and unstable Minds, by counterfeiting the plausible Names of things in themselves most excellent, but most dangerous when abused; such as Liberty, Property, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and Religion.</p>
            <p>By these wretched Instruments, was this most gentle, and benign Government again reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Tyranny, and Arbitrary Power: The Church of <hi>England</hi> was once more Traduced, as Popishly affected: The most able Officers, and faithfullest Servants of the Crown again Reviled, under the odious Title of Evil Councellours.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Sedition and Schism were every where promoted; unreasonable Fears sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested; vain Suspicions of future Dangers aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to destroy the present Tranquility; des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Speeches, infamous Libels, Traiterous Books swarm'd in all places; and under colour of the only True Protestant, the worst of all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Principles were put in practise; all the old Republican, and Antimonarchical Doctrines, whose Effects had formerly prov'd so dismal, were now again as confidently own'd, and asserted, as ever they had been during the hottest Rage of the late unhappy Troubles.</p>
            <p>From these Preparations to a new Rebellion, the Party began by degrees to proceed to Action. Distinctions of Sides were made: Names, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44330:6"/>
Tokens of Separation were given: Illegal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles were maintained, in defiance of the Laws of God, and Man: Tumultuous Feasts, and Factious Clubs were set up in City, and Country: Close, and Seditious Meetings haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Frequent Cabals appointed, and by Men of high degree with the lowest: Great Stores of Arms provided by private Persons: Insolent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses made through divers Countries; thereby to glory in their Numbers, and to carry far and near the Terrour of their Power, and even to Muster their Party ready for some sudden Blow, or general Insurrection.</p>
            <p>All these, and many more such Personal Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and Publick Assaults on the Government, his Majesty long endured with the same Mildness, and Clemency, wherewith he had already for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given the highest Crimes against himself; His Royal Goodness still patiently expecting, and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that in time the most obstinate of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided Subjects would see their Errour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn at length to a sense of the Duty, they owe him by all the strongest Bands of Nature and Laws, Religion and Gratitude, that can possibly oblige Subjects towards a Soveraign.</p>
            <p>But when his Majesty was abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that all those dark Consultations, and open Tumults of unruly Men, were but so many infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Signs, and Forerunners of Rebellion, or some extraordinary Commotions; Then at last, in a tender respect to his Peoples Safety, more than to his own, was his Majesty constrain'd to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Authority, to try what good Effect the Vigour of his Laws would have on those Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44330:6"/>
with whom all his repeated Mercy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence had so little prevail'd.</p>
            <p>Yet such was then his Majesties hard Fortune, so firmly combined were the Disaffected, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by their Prevalent Interest in packing the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> that whilst his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty carefully endeavour'd to distribute Impartial Justice to all his Subjects, he could not obtain the same Right Himself; his Enemies still becoming more numerous, and united in those very places, where their desperate Enterprises against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, were likely to be most sudden and pernicious.</p>
            <p>Amongst divers other infamous Examples of this Nature, was that of <hi>Colledge</hi> the Joyner. For though the Criminal was so mean a Man, and no other ways considerable, but for his audacious Forwardness in affronting the Government; yet his Majesty, with all his Royal Authority, could hardly prevail to have him brought to a Fair and Legal Tryal. Nor had his Majesty been able at last to procure so much Justice to be done, had not the Process been removed into another County, where (the Rulers of the Faction being less po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful,) that new and damnable Opinion and Practice of the Lawfulness of Equivocating and even of Perjury for the <hi>Good Old cause,</hi> had not prevailed over the old and honest English Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Truth and Honour.</p>
            <p>However though in the end his Majesties Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice got the better at that time, yet it was defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a greater, and more important Instance, that of the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> who had been long and reasonably suspected, and in the issue
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44330:7"/>
was manifestly discovered to be the chief Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and supreme Manager of all these Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Contrivances against his Majesties Crowns and Life.</p>
            <p>The said Earl his Majesty had formerly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, inrich'd, enobled, and advanc'd to one of the highest Stations in the Kingdom; by a long Succession of manifold Bounties, endeavouring to render his Abilities, and Experience in Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, serviceable to his King, and beneficial to his Country.</p>
            <p>Yet so treacherous and undermining was his Genius; so unmeasurable his Ambition; so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of quiet, and moderate Courses; so much fitter he was to be the Instrument of a Tyrant, than the Servant of a Just and Good Prince; that after many hainous Infidelities and Offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him, and forgiven by his Majesty, he was at length necessitated to discharge him his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; yet so as to leave him one of the most considerable Peers in the Kingdom for Title and Estate.</p>
            <p>But his aspiring and revengeful Spirit could not brook so gentle a disgrace. Wherefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deservedly been dismiss'd the Court, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently attempted to set the Country directly against it. Immediately he profess'd himself the most zealous true Protestant, and the greatest Patriot; Thereby slily insinuating his designs into the Heads of all Sects and Divisions in Church and State: To them betraying some, vilifying others; maliciously interpreting all his Majesties Counsels; Making those very Consultations, and resolutions of State, whereof he had been the chief Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44330:7"/>
when he was in Power, to be the principal objections against the Government, when he was displaced.</p>
            <p>Thus he and his party went boldly on to disturb the publick quiet, and to affront his Majesties Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the highest Insolence: In Words and Writings defaming it, as Arbitrary and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, whilst in Deeds he insulted over it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it to be weak, and resolving to make it despicable. And all this with a secure confidence not only of Indempnity, but Success; Knowing himself to be under the protection of Juries of his own appointment, or approbation: And therefore presuming he was far out of the reach of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties just Indignation.</p>
            <p>And so for a time it unhappily proved. For being legally indicted of Crimes of the highest Nature; though the Evidence against him was cleer, and positive; some of the Witnesses being the very same Men, whose Testimony had been approved of, in the prosecution of <hi>Oats</hi>'s Plot; And the very Original draught of a treasonable Association having been actually found in his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody; yet he could not be brought to a Lawful Trial by his Peers, the Indictment being stifled by a shameful <hi>Ignoramus;</hi> and that accompanied with so much Insolence, that the very Ministers of his Majesties Justice were in much more danger than the Criminal, and hardly escap'd the rude Assaults of his Confederates and Party.</p>
            <p>However, from so great a Violation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right, and of the Royal Dignity, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty gain'd this very considerable Advantage, That thenceforth he plainly perceived the main Strength
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44330:8"/>
of all his Enemies Arrogance lay in their Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Power to pack the City-Juries. For what Treason might not the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> securely Project, or <hi>Ferguson</hi> Write, or an Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation Act against the Government, whilst <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough,</hi> and a setled Club, was at hand with their Corrupt Pannels, to Indempnifie, and if need were, to second and applaud their most Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous Practices?</p>
            <p>Wherefore his Majesty foreseeing how destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, in time, the Effects of so great and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Mischief would be, resolved at length, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many Intolerable Provocations, to strike at that which he had now found to be the very Root of the Faction.</p>
            <p>This his Majesty, and all wise and good Men perceiv'd, could be no other ways done, than first by reducing the Elections of the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> to their Antient Order and Rules, that of late were become only a Business of Clamour and Violence: And then to make Inquiry into the Validity of the City-Charter it self; which an ill Party of Men had abused to the Danger, and would have done it to the Destruction of the Government, had they been suffer'd to go on never so little farther uncontroul'd.</p>
            <p>In both these most just and necessary Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, the Righteous<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44330:8"/>
of Justice once more put in a way of being cleared from Partiality and Corruption. And then a due Judgment was obtain'd, by an equal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Law, against the Charter it self, and its Franchises declared forfeited to his Majesty.</p>
            <p>But though this happy Event of his Majesties Controversie with the disaffected part of the City of <hi>London,</hi> was in all Humane probability, the only effectual Course to provide for the future Peace, and Stability of the Government; yet it had like to have proved a present Occasion of its utter Ruine.</p>
            <p>For when so many guilty Persons found, that the great Point of the Sheriffs was resetled on its Antient Bottom, and the City-Charter it self in hazard of being speedily vacated; so that now there would be no farther evasion for them, by any pretence of Law, to escape unpunish'd: Then they concluded it was high time to bring their Devilish Purposes to a quicker issue, and once for all to strike boldly at the Heart of the KING and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Particularly the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to himself of the blackness of his Crimes, and of the Iniquity of the Verdict, by which he had for that time escaped; and finding he was now within the compass of the Justice he had so lately frustrated and contemn'd, thenceforth gave over all his quieter and more plausible Arts of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whereby he proudly bragg'd he should, in time, as his Expression was, <hi>Leisurely walk his Majesty out of his Dominions;</hi> and on a sudden betook himself to more precipitate Enterprises: Alarming his Companions with a prospect of their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44330:9"/>
common danger; thence inflaming some to Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, others to Assassinations; supposing now there was no way left for him, or them, to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their former Misdemeanors and Treasons, but by attempting and succeeding in greater Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.</p>
            <p>This was found by evident Proof to have been the principal rise and occasion of ripening the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Conspiracy in the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> Nor could there possibly have happen'd a stronger Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of his Majesties Counsels in attempting to rectifie the City-Juries and Elections; since it is apparent his principal Enemies laid so much stress on the unjust Power they had therein usurp'd, that, being once fairly driven from that Strength, they immediately resolv'd, nothing less than a bare-fac'd and avow'd Rebellion could repair the Loss their Party sustain'd by so great a Blow.</p>
            <p>As for his Majesties Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it is notorious there has been long shelter'd in it a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Faction of furious Zealots, that under the old Professions of the Cause of Christ, and a purer way of Gospel-Worship, has grown up by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to a Violation at last, not only of all the Rules and Institutions of true Religion, but of common Humanity. For does not the whole Christian World at this day behold with Horrour, that the most Villanous Tenets of the fiercest Scottish Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters, and even of their Remonstrators, have been out-done by their Successors and Disciples in the Field-Meetings, and Armed Conventicles? Have they not thence proceeded to all the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Rage of Rapine and Violence? In so much that some of them have lived and died glorying
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44330:9"/>
in the most barbarous Murders, and basest Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; refusing obstinately with their last Breath, so much as to pray for his Majesty, or to say, <hi>God save the King;</hi> though by an unexampled Mercy, they had their Pardons assur'd to them at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place and moment of their Execution, upon that single Condition.</p>
            <p>And besides the remains of those Bloody En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts, whose Principles are not yet entirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd, though their force has been twice van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd in open Field, by Gods Providence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spering his Majesties Arms; It is certain also the Peace of that Kingdom has of late been much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd by other great Numbers of Factious and Seditious Spirits, who, though at first they would not venture to incourage publickly the others declared Treasons, yet stuck not secretly to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and foment their Cause, and as the event in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly proves, would soon have Own'd and Headed their Fury, had it prosper'd.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the wise care of former Sessions of Parliament there, having sufficiently provided by a due severity of Good Laws, against the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Consequences of continuing the Field-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for the farther securing the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Antient Rights of the Crown and the Royal Family in that Kingdom, it was judg'd adviseable, by the Wisdom of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties great Council, the last Session of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to appoint and Authorise a Solemn Test to be taken by all Persons in place of publick Trust, or Power.</p>
            <p>In that Session the Test was soon pass'd into an Act of State, without any considerable opposition:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44330:10"/>
Though there were not wanting some turbulent Men in the Assembly, who took that occasion of shewing, how ill they were affected to the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sh'd Government of their Country; Which they could have no other inducement to be, but either a desire of Commotions, by reason of the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate State of their own ill-spent Fortunes, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy at the better Condition of Honester Men, or some inveterate Contagion of Treason, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved down to them from the last unhappy Age of Confusions.</p>
            <p>Of that unquiet and seditious Party, the chief and declared Head was the late Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who during the very sitting of the Parliament, had, by many indirect ways, attempted to hinder his Majesties Service; the said Earl, and the then President of the Session, and their Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces taking their opportunity, in wording the Test, to add thereto all the very same Clauses, that have since given any Colour of scruple to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But when all his crafts for obstructing the Bill were defeated by the far greater Number of well disposed Members, the Loyal Voters for it being at least Ten to one of the disaffected; then no sooner was the Parliament adjourn'd, but the said Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> first at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> next in traversing several Shires, did make it his Chief Business to insinuate every where, into the minds of the Clergy and Laity, the most malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prejudices imaginable against the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Test.</p>
            <p>And afterwards on his return to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> he often presumptuously declared, he would either not take it at all, or take it only with a reserve of his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44330:10"/>
own explanation; which he put in Writing and dispers'd: the contrivance of it being such, as dissolves all the Obligations of the Oath, and makes his own present Fancy and private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the only Standard, whereby he meant to be guided in all the publick Duties of his Loyalty and Allegiance.</p>
            <p>At length his Majesties High Commissioner the <hi>Duke,</hi> and the Privy Council of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, having been well inform'd of the said Earls seditious Carriage in City and Country, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully confirm'd in their Judgments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of his Trayterous Purposes, in that falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and equivocating Paraphrase on the Test, which he own'd in their presence, perverting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the sound sense, and eluding the force of his Majesties Laws, in order to set the Subjects loose from their Obedience, and to perpetuate Schism in the Church, and Faction in the State: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these Grounds, he was most deservedly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by his Majesties Advocate, before the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Justice-Court, according to the known Laws of his Country; and after a full and equal Tryal, he was found guilty of Treason, by the Learned Judges, and a Jury not only of his Peers, but also many of them his own nearest Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Soon after Judgment given, albeit the King was far from any thought of taking away his Life, and that no farther prejudice was design'd against him, but the forfeiture of some Jurisdictions and Superiorities, which he and his Predecessors had surreptitiously acquired, and most tyrannically exercis'd; besides the disposal of part of his Estate
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44330:11"/>
to pay his just Creditors, and some few moderate Donatives to those, whom he and his Father had formerly ruin'd for their Fidelity to his Majesty, the Surplusage being intended entirely to return, and descend to his Family; yet the said Earl abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the great Freedom indulg'd him in Prison, (which he enjoy'd as largely after his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as before) fled from his Majesties Mercy, the knowledge of his own Guilt not suffering him to venture on that Clemency, whereof he had before participated so plentifully, when he was under the like Sentence of Condemnation.</p>
            <p>The King however, notwithstanding this new Provocation, still retain'd the same benign thoughts of favouring his Wife and Children. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was known that the said Earl had more Debt on his Estate than the full value of it amounted to, (which really was his Case) his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was graciously pleas'd, in one Royal Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gess, to give thrice more of the Inheritance to his Posterity, than their Father could lawfully have done, had it never been forfeited.</p>
            <p>But how ill he deserved, or requited so many Acts of Grace and Bounty, will appear by the sequel of his Behaviour after his Escape. For in stead of doing what his Complices and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants gave out he intended, that he would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cast himself at his Majesties Feet, and implore his Pardon, which he, of all Men living, had no reason to think desperate, he is no where to be found, but associating with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties implacable Enemies in the Head of new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of Treason, employs his Liberty abroad in maintaining Traiterous Correspondences at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44330:11"/>
Home, with restless Malice exciting the wicked Conspirators of both Kingdoms to a fatal Union against the Life, Government and Family of his Liege Soveraign and Benefactor.</p>
            <p>And all this is to be proved upon him by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments as clear as the Sun, by the Credit of his own Authentick Letters, and by the plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of his principal Messengers and Agents in the whole Villany.</p>
            <p>By this brief Recollection of the troubled State of Affairs, and the Tumultuous Temper of ill Mens Minds, in his Majesties Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the time when this treasonable Conspiracy was in agitation, the impartial World may perceive, from what destructive seeds of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, private Passions and Animosities, under the disguise of Religion and the publick Interest, so Monstrous a Birth was produced.</p>
            <p>In the wonderful Discovery of which detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confederacy, and in the happy Prevention of its dire Effects, as all who have heard of it, must acknowledge that a signal care of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has appear'd, for his Majesties and these Nations Preservation: So his Majesty gives the Sacred Word and Protestation of a King, that nothing has been done, on his part, but what was agreeable to that Royal Benignity and Natural Candor of his whole Life, whereof all the World, even his Enemies, have had such undoubted Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p>The Evidence was, most of it, deliver'd in his Majesties own presence. The Examinations were taken by Men of unquestionable Reputation and Honour. The whole Proceeding has been
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44330:12"/>
managed with all imaginable Integrity. There has been no straining or extorting of Accusations to blemish the Fame of the Innocent.: No Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Rewards proposed: No Pardon assured before-hand, for discovering or aggravating the Crimes of the Guilty.</p>
            <p>Some Witnesses, who offer'd themselves, of whom there might have been any colourable Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, his Majesty wholly rejected: Lest it should once again happen, that the blasted Credit, or needy Condition, or profligate Lives of the Persons deposing should derogate from the strength of their Depositions, and administer any the least doubt of Subornation.</p>
            <p>Those Witnesses his Majesty admitted had been generally Men strongly prepossess'd in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, Zeal and Interest for that Party: Men whose former avow'd Hatred of the Government was reason sufficient to gain them an absolute trust with any, who studied to overthrow it. They were not of desperate Fortunes; Nor despicable Men. For the most part they separately and singly brought in their Discoveries. Divers of them had little or no Conversation or Familiarity one with another. There was no shadow, or possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a combination between them all to discover; yet such is the prevalence of Self-convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and so great the Power of Truth, that all their several Discoveries did perfectly agree with themselves and with each other in all material parts and circumstances.</p>
            <p>It was therefore in the Summer of the Year 1683, a time when all his Majesties Dominions injoyed a settled Peace, and profound security,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44330:12"/>
whilst the greatest part of the Neighbouring World was involved in Wars and Combustions, that his Majesty and his Council were suddenly awaken'd with the surprizing Knowledge of this dreadful Conspiracy, which had been laying ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deep and broad for many Months before.</p>
            <p>The Man whom God chose to make the first Discoverer, was <hi>Josiah Keeling,</hi> Citizen and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>London.</hi> A Person of good Credit in the common Business of his Calling: but otherwise a most perverse Fanatick; so fiercely addicted to their Cause, that he had been one of the busiest Sticklers in all the late Publick Oppositions against the Government. Particularly, he was the very Man who undertook, and perform'd the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent Assault upon Authority, that perhaps the Party ever attempted in full Peace; which was the Arresting the Lord Mayor, in open Day, in the midst of the City of <hi>London,</hi> for refusing to admit the pretended Sheriffs, who had been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by those Meetings of the Factious in and about the City, that the Law has since condemn'd as Unlawful and Riotous.</p>
            <p>However, by so eminent and bold a piece of Service, together with his former approved Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Violence for the discontented Interest, was <hi>Keeling</hi> judg'd by the chief Conspirators fitly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifi'd to be admitted into their most private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations. And accordingly thereafter they trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, as one of their surest Confidents. In so much that he was invited to make one of the Forty Miscreants, whose proper part it was to Assassinate his Majesties and his Royal Highnesses Persons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:44330:13"/>
Of which Number after he had freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to be, and had met and acted jointly with the rest for some time, to prepare the cursed Work for a speedy Execution; it pleased the Divine Goodness so to touch his Soul with the Horrour of so amazing a Crime, that he could not rest Day nor Night, till after much conflict in his Mind, he had fully determin'd to discharge his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Hellish Secret.</p>
            <p>Wherefore having first Communicated some part of his burden to one Mr. <hi>Peckam</hi> his private Friend, who had often before warn'd him in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the dangerous course he was in, by so deeply ingaging in all the former Seditious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, he was by him directed to address himself to the Lord <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> one of his Majesties Privy Council, who remitted him to Sir <hi>Leolyn Jenkins,</hi> Principal Secretary of State, before whom he gave his first Information upon Oath, and in due form of Law, on the Twelfth of <hi>June</hi> in that Year.</p>
            <p>But the intended Assassination, upon the first disclosing of it, appear'd to be so prodigious a Barbarity, that his Majesty for some time gave but very little Ear, and slow Credit to this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as little suspecting as deserving such usage from the worst of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>Which generous Caution that his Majesty took, not to be impos'd on by New Rumours of Plots, and his Gracious Tenderness not to believe so ill of his very Enemies, but upon certain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, was one of the chief Occasions, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the principal Agitators and Managers of the whole business, took the Alarm, and got time to scatter and withdraw beyond the Seas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44330:13"/>
However, by Gods Providence continually watching over his Majesties and these Nations safety, so many of the Traytors soon after fell into the Hands of Justice, who did either volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily acknowledge their being Partakers of the Treason, or were Convicted of it by Evident Proof; that henceforth who ever shall pretend not to believe the Truth of the whole, they must either be such as were Parties in the Design, or so monstrously unreasonable, as to believe there never can be a Real Plot against any Prince or State, but what does actually succeed and take effect.</p>
            <p>Thus much is certain of this Conspiracy, and it is so remarkable and extraordinary, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the like cannot be affirm'd of any other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in all History, that there was scarce a Man Attainted, or Executed for it, who did not, more or less, add some new Light to the several parts of the dark Contrivance; either by a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it, or by their very manner of denying it; and by the weakness of the Subterfuges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they endeavour'd to palliate their Crimes.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole Matter, though his Majesty doubts not but the Treasonable Infection was, in some degree or other, spread into most Quarters of these Kingdoms, amongst the Ringleaders of the Republican Clubs, and lawless Conventicles in Town and Country; there being no reason for any Man to think otherwise, since it was the usual boast of their principal Factors, That more than Twenty Thousand Persons were made privy to the very beginnings of it, before the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Flight: Yet his Majesty utterly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44330:14"/>
abhorring that bare Suspicions, though never so probably grounded, should prevail to conclude any Man Guilty, has resolved no Reflection shall be made on the Fame of any, but only such, whose part in it was made out by positive Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>And in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> besides the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who during his time, was the Prime Engineer in contriving and directing all the several Motions and Parts of the whole Conspiracy; next under him, the Persons who are already Judicially found to have been deeply concern'd as Actors, some in the Insurrection part, others in the Assassination, divers of them in both together, are these,</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whom the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Party had long Corrupted, and Alienated from his Duty and Gratitude to the King and his Royal Highness, by suggesting and increasing in him groundless Fears, and poys'ning his Mind with unjust and forbidden Hopes.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wark,</hi> who for some Years had been ingaged in the most furious Designs of the Faction; of late especially, after he found that the Wickedness of his private Life could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be so well hidden, or go unpunish'd in a quiet State as in publick Disturbances.</p>
            <p>The late Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> whose dark and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirit and insatiable Ambition had carry'd him on to be one of the Principal Authors of all the late Distractions in Publick Councils and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Heats against the Government: Till after many such ill Practices, unworthy the Son of such a Father, God left him at last to fall into this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44330:14"/>
Precipice; and permitted him to punish himself for it more severely than the King could ever have found in his Heart to do, had he but given his Majesty time to make use of the excellent Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Nature.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Escrick,</hi> who had always been a busie Promoter of Fanatical and Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Projects for Alterations in Church and State; and was therefore for a time the second Favourite of the Disaffected, whilst he was Imprison'd with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> Nor did they ever make any Objections against the Honesty of his private Life, till he came to the honestest part of it.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> a Person carried away beyond his Duty and Allegiance into this Traiterous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, by a vain Air of Popularity, and a wild Suspicion of losing a great Estate by an imaginary return of Popery; whereby he was the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily seduced by the wicked Teachers of that most Unchristian Doctrine, which has been the cause of so many Rebellions, and was so conformable to his Presbyterian Education, That <hi>it is lawful to Resist and Rise against Soveraign Princes for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Algernoon Sidney,</hi> who from his Youth had profest himself an Enemy to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Country, and had acted accordingly. As he lived, so he died, a Stubborn Assertor of the <hi>Good Old Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Hambden</hi> the Younger, who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd, and continued the Hereditary Malignity of his House against the Royal Family; his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father having been the most Active Instrument to widen the Breach between the late Blessed KING,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44330:15"/>

            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> a Debauch'd Atheistical Bravo; one of those, who with an Hypocrisie pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to this Age, would have pass'd for the most forward Reformers of Church and State; whilst they themselves both in their Practise and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were the greatest Corrupters of Virtue, and all Good Manners.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Walcot,</hi> an Old Officer in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Army; who after Pardon and Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity receiv'd, and a plentiful Estate secured to him by his Majesties most Happy Return, yet was actually ingaged in all the Plots against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ever since: Particularly in that of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> some Years ago, to surprize the Castle of <hi>Dublin.</hi> He was Introduced by the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> under the Character of a Stout and Able Officer, into a strict Familiarity with the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bnry;</hi> from whom he never after parted till his Death; accompanying him in his Flight into <hi>Holland,</hi> and returning thence with his Corps; he and <hi>Ferguson</hi> having this peculiar Mark of his Kindness, to be named Legatees in his Last Will and Testament, as his special Friends.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>John Romzey,</hi> who had gotten Credit abroad in <hi>Portugal,</hi> by his Courage and Skill in Military Affairs.

These were all Men of Crafty Heads, and Nimble Tongues; restless Spreaders of false News, bold Talkers in Seditious Clubs; where, according to the corrupt fashion of those Times, the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate Persons of all Conditions were wont openly to Arraign the Monarchy, and vilifie the Church, under the fair shows of amending both, and a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Concernment for the Publick Good.</p>

            <p>Sir <hi>John Cockran,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Baillie,</hi> Men egregiously disaffected to the Government, and therefore of considerable Interest with its most desperate Enemies in both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>These, together with <hi>Monroe,</hi> were the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons desired by the English Managers, to come up to <hi>London,</hi> and Treat of a Joint Conspiracy with their Brethren here, under the disguise of Planting <hi>Carolina.</hi> At the same time Lieutenant

Colonel <hi>Walcot</hi> was call'd out of <hi>Ireland</hi> for the same end, but under colour of being the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Governour of that Plantation. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they were first invited hither by the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and after his Death again sent for by a Particular Messenger. Accordingly they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally came up and Negotiated here some time, in order to a firm Conjunction between the Traytors of both Nations for a general Rising. Nor was the Treaty wholly broke off, or adjusted, at the very time when the Discovery broke forth.</p>
            <p>To these are to be added, <hi>James Steuart,</hi> Son to Sir <hi>James Steuart</hi> sometimes Provost of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> He was fitted for such a design by his hot and fiery Temper, and by his Education, and his Fathers Example; who together with most of his Relations, were violent Covenanters.

            <p>The Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> descended from Progenitors of such Principles as have been ever against the <hi>Crown,</hi> when they have fancied their Kings not Zealous for the Reformation.

            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44330:17"/>
Sir <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> of <hi>Polwart,</hi> who kept Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> many Years, and had been formerly Imprison'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> for Traiterous Expressions.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Pringle</hi> Laird of <hi>Corwoodlee,</hi> a noted Fanatick, and of Antimonarchical Principles from his Infancy.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Denham</hi> of <hi>East-Sheels,</hi> just such another, but less cautious, and more headstrong.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Montgomery</hi> of <hi>Lenshaw,</hi> a Covenanter to the highest degree of Bigottry.</p>
            <p>Commissary <hi>Monroe,</hi> who had well serv'd his Majesty in the Wars, as an active, brave Man: But upon some Injuries he pretended to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the Duke of <hi>Lauderdail,</hi> he grew en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd to such a degree, as led him into these Courses; which now make him so uneasie to himself, that he has often begg'd of his Keeper to kill him, for such an ungrateful Wretch should not live.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hugh Scot</hi> Laird of <hi>Gallowsheels, James Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> Laird of <hi>Philiphaugh,</hi> both zealous Sticklers for the Field-Conventicle-Meetings.</p>
            <p>Besides these, the Principal Scottish Agents, there were divers other inferior Emissaries of that Nation, who went to and fro to carry on the Traiterous Intercourse between <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and with the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> Such as <hi>William Carstares,</hi> a Scotch Conventicle-Preacher to a Numerous Meeting at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> where <hi>Rumbald</hi> was his frequent Hearer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Spence,</hi> who had been Comptroler, and was now Employed as Secretary to the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> taken in <hi>London</hi> under the Name of <hi>Butler.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:44330:18"/>
               <hi>John Nisbet,</hi> born in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> bred up at the University of <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> where he was the Leader of those Seditious Students, who rais'd a Tumult upon occasion of Burning the Pope in that City.</p>
            <p>But of all the Conspirators, whether English, or Scotch, the Man, to whom next the late Earls of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and <hi>Argyle,</hi> belong'd the chief place and precedence in the whole Diabolical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, was <hi>Robert Ferguson</hi> a Scotch-Man; he had been divers Years a fierce Independent-Preacher in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and had long Brandish'd his Poys'nous Tongue and Virulent Pen against the Government: He is manifestly convicted to have had a Hand in the most Scandalous Libels of those Times; And was always particularly cherished, magnified and maintained by the Party, for his peculiar Talent in aspersing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and reviling his Majesties Person. So that upon all Accounts, of his restless Spirit, fluent Tongue, subtil Brain, and hellish Malice, he was perfectly qualifi'd to be the great Incendiary, and common Agitator of the whole Conspiracy; and after <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Death, it cannot be denied, but he was the Life, and Soul of all, especially for the carrying on of the Assassination.</p>
            <p>These Persons appear hitherto to have been the principal Contrivers or Instruments of the whole Treason, in the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divers others there are, concerning whom more than conjectural Proofs may be given, of their being engaged in it: But his Majesty is willing to spare particular Names, as far as may stand with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44330:18"/>
the Necessary, and Just Vindication of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>It may suffice, that of these his Majesty has here allowed to be mention'd, the World is abundantly satisfied, that the several Shares they undertook in this Conspiracy, were very agreeable to their former well known perverse Principles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Disaffections to the Government.</p>
            <p>It is therefore certain that in the Year 1682, before, and especially after <hi>Midsummer-Day,</hi> when the great Business of Electing the City Sheriffs came of course to be Agitated; the whole Factious Interest in and about the Town, prepared to employ the Main of their Power and Craft in preventing the Swearing of the True Sheriffs, on the <hi>Michaelmas-Day</hi> ensuing.</p>
            <p>All which time nothing was omitted by the Disloyal Citizens, and great Numbers of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers unduly mingled with them in all their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, to elude or terrifie the Honest Zeal of the Loyal, and to deceive and gain over the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Members of the City; Whether by direct or indirect ways, it matter'd not: For just about that time the New and Devilish Invention came to be most in Vogue, by which they made the receiving all Oaths, and taking the very Blessed Sacrament of the Lords Supper, to be only an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument for the promoting their pretended Godly Designs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in that space of time, all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prophane, and seemingly holy Cheats and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varications were practis'd: All sorts of Arms ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before known to be procured in such Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by private Persons; such as Blunderbusses,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44330:19"/>
Steel Armor cover'd with Silk, and the like, were carefully sought after, and bought up: The most improbable false Rumors fill'd every Street; That now all true Protestants were to be Massacred in an instant; That such Sheriffs were Nominated, as had consented to be the Executioners; That Popery was speedily to be Introduced barefac'd, and in Triumph; That all faithful Adherents to the Government were but Papists in Mascarade: Popery being still made the Word of Alarm to excite and exasperate the Populace: Though it is manifest, the Authors of all those Clamours against Popery, never intended its Suppression: For that would not have consisted with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, which was, by the Popular Dread of it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occasions to shake the Crown, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truth is, to such a heighth of Arrogance were things grown on their side, that whoever shall indifferently reflect on the dangerous Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, slanderous Reports and Writings, and other violent Emotions of the whole Party, that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the City, they will have just cause to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the course of their Proceedings was not so much a Civil Struggle against their Fellow-Citizens for Victory in the Peaceable Choice of Two subordinate Officers of Justice, as a Decisive Contention for a Mastery over the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Yet however cunningly the Train was laid, it took no effect but on themselves. The Noise and Rage of all their Mutinous Routs in Taverns and Coffee-Houses vanish'd into Air. Sir <hi>John Moor</hi> the Lord Mayor, together with the greater number
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44330:19"/>
of wiser, richer, and better Citizens, understood rightly, and stuck unmoveably to the Kingdoms, and their own true Interest. Mr. <hi>North</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> were quietly admitted, and sworn Sheriffs at the appointed time, with the usual Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Immediately after this, the very same Night the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> privately withdrew from his own House, redoubling his old Exclamations of Popery, Tyranny, Superstition, Idolatry, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, Murders, Irish Witnesses; of whose Subornation no Man in the three Kingdoms could have given a more exact account than himself.</p>
            <p>Whilst he thus lay secret in the City, <hi>Romzey, Walcot, Ferguson, Goodenough,</hi> and others his Complices, daily frequenting him, they applied themselves with all diligence to expedite the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Work before projected: His Vain-glory, and the Conceit of his own Dexterity, and his former constant success in making Confusions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining him to fancy, what his Flatterers suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the whole City and Kingdom were at his beck, and upon the holding up of his Finger, would presently rise in Arms to extirpate the two Brothers, Slavery and Popery, as they were lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wont, in their private Debauches, to style the King and his Royal Highness.</p>
            <p>The said Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set on foot a Treaty with the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who, after his escape out of <hi>Edenburgh-</hi>Castle, came privily to <hi>London,</hi> held divers Meetings with the Confederates, and offer'd, that for 30000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling he would make a sturdy Commotion in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But the Sum of Money demanded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44330:20"/>
so considerable, and many other Scruples start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and unforeseen Difficulties rising, which could not so presently be removed, as <hi>Argyle</hi>'s pressing danger required, he first quitted the Field, and retired into <hi>Holland,</hi> with intention there at a greater distance, and more security, to renew and prosecute the same Proposal.</p>
            <p>About that time also both ways of destroying these Kingdoms were brought under their Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the general way of an Insurrection, and the more compendious way, as they call'd it, of Assassinating the King and Duke in their return that <hi>October</hi> from <hi>Newmarket.</hi> The Insurrection was instantly promoted on all Hands, in Town and Country. But the Assassination having then not been soon enough thought on, went no farther than Discourse, to be afterwards resumed, and more deliberately provided for against the next Opportunity.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the long expected <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-Day</hi> being thus calmly pass'd, and the New Sheriffs having taken a peaceable Possession of that Power, whose influence on the whole Nation, the said Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> well understood, no Man better: Then he began on a sudden to have a quicker and sharper sense of the urgent State of their common Affairs, especially of his own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Peril, and to accuse the rest of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates of backwardness, if not of Treachery in the Public Cause: First communicating his Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions and Jealousies to the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> who had been so lately the Companion of his restraint, and Gaol-Delivery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:44330:20"/>
The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was retir'd some Days before into <hi>Essex,</hi> waiting the result of that great Day in the City, whence he receiv'd frequent intimations from his Friends of the Faction, in a Style obscure, but by him well understood and concerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; That now the business which had been Transacting so long amongst his Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, was coming to good Issue, and call'd for his speedy presence.</p>
            <p>That occasioned his return on the same <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas-Day,</hi> and presently after, <hi>Walcot</hi> came to him from the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> with a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage expressing his earnest desire to speak with him, in his Concealment at one <hi>Watson</hi>'s in <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> giving him a Visit, the substance of the said Earl's first discourse with him, was, That finding the Due Elections, as he call'd them, of the City frustrated, and the Pseudo-Sheriffs establish'd, he could no longer think any honest Man safe; and had therefore hid himself there, having first made what Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were needful for a sudden Rising: That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thousands were ready in the City to Master the Gates, and attack <hi>Whitehal:</hi> That they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were to be assisted from the Countries adjacent with 1000 or 1200 Horse under good Officers. Only he complained of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s, and the other great Mens backwardness, who had promised, by Rising in other remote Counties at the same time, to give a Diversion to the standing Forces.</p>
            <p>The Sum of this the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> the next day Communicated to the said Duke; who also on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44330:21"/>
his part complain'd of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of late on a separate Bottom, and that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Fears had blinded his usual Prudence; and therefore he required a speedy Meeting with him, to re-establish a better Understanding and Union of Counsels between them all for the future.</p>
            <p>This discourse being reported back to the said Earl, he replied, <hi>His People were impatient of longer delays, having advanc'd so far, that there was no retreat; the Design being imparted to so many, that it was impossible but it would quickly take Air.</hi> Upon this he proceeded to declare his vehement suspicion of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth; That his Dilatoriness proceeded from some private Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between him and his Majesty: That it was to be fear'd the said Duke acted with a prospect very different from theirs; only minding the advancement of himself: whereas his own Resolutions were, that since it was now manifest their Liberties were no more to be secur'd but under a Commonwealth, he alone with his Interest would attempt the Deliverance of his Country: If the rest of the Lords would concur with him, they might share in the Glory; else he hoped he should be able to effect the Work without them, by the help of an honest brisk Party in the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Answer the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that before their People could be ready in the Country, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s unseasonable Anxiety for his own Safety might put him on at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting some rash Action in <hi>London,</hi> which would be easily quell'd by the form'd and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd Guards, and so the whole Design might be stifled in a moment; he did therefore the more earnestly press the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> to make another essay to procure an Interview.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:44330:21"/>
The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> did so, and got from the said Earl a promise of meeting the Confederate Lords the next Day in the Evening; which yet, when the time came, he put off with an excuse by Colonel <hi>Romzey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, some Days after they did meet; their Differences were in some measure piec'd up, and they began to act jointly again towards a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Insurrection.</p>
            <p>To this purpose several Days were proposed. One about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> but it was delay'd a little longer, till the concurrence of the the several Counties could be signified up: Then that of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being <hi>Novemb.</hi> 17. was named, but rejected, because all his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Guards were commonly in Arms to watch and suppress the wonted Tumults of the Rabble on that Day.</p>
            <p>At last the Nineteenth of <hi>November</hi> was fixt on; which happening that Year to be on a <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> whilst some excepted against it for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Ferguson</hi> with his usual impious Virulency, reply'd, <hi>That the Sanctity of the Day was suitable to the Sanctity of the Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Day being thus determin'd, they all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fell to prepare as their several parts were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted: Especially the great Managers held As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies to receive Accounts, how the Counties were dispos'd, and to consult upon surprizing the Guards; for which end the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to view the posture of their Quarters, and reported back to their Principals, <hi>That the seizing them was a thing very feasible;</hi> which very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44330:22"/>
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> afterwards confess'd in so many words to his Majesty, when he rendred himself.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was very uneasie, and weary of lurking in Holes, where every sound and breath of Air began to frighten him. Wherefore with repeated and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Messages he press'd the other Lords to keep to their Day; expostulating with them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their former slowness, whereby they had lost so many advantageous Opportunities. The case being now so much alter'd, that he, who once presum'd his driving out the King would prove but a leisurely walk to him; when the danger drew near himself, was become so apprehensive, and rash, as not to afford his own wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels leisure enough to come to any tolerable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.</p>
            <p>At length one Day, when their great Council about <hi>London</hi> was assembled at <hi>Shepard</hi>'s House in <hi>Abchurch-Lane,</hi> the said Earl sent Colonel <hi>Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zey</hi> to quicken their Debates, and once for all to learn the result of their final Determinations. But they having just before received several Advices out of the West, that their Friends there, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ready on so short a warning, presently sent him back such word; concluding it could not be helpt, but he and they must be content to respite the time of Execution to a longer day.</p>
            <p>This positive Answer broke all his Measures, and made him instantly resolve to leave <hi>England.</hi> Wherefore first he removed his lodging into <hi>Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;</hi> Then, the very Night that place was Burnt,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44330:22"/>
being also the Night of the same 19th Day of <hi>November</hi> on which he had expected to set the whole Nation in a Flame, he privately sculk'd down the River; Attended only by the two chief Complices and Witnesses of his Treasons, <hi>Walcot</hi> and <hi>Ferguson;</hi> the latter of them having been forc'd for some time before to abscond too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of a Warrant out against him, for Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some one, or other of his many Treasonable Pamphlets.</p>
            <p>That was the last considerable Effort made by the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> against the King and Kingdom. After this, nothing more was heard of him, but that being got into <hi>Holland</hi> in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick fright, he lived obscurely and soon after died in <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> having few or no other Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the last part of his Life, but several mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable English and Scotch Fugitives, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been the Instruments of his Trayterous Practises, and were forc'd to fly the stroke of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, on that Account: So that he could not but know, that all those about him in his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Death, had Just reason to hate, and curse him, as their principal Seducer and cause of their Ruine.</p>
            <p>Nor can such an end of such a Life be justly reflected on, without a special Adoration of the secret Counsels of the Divine Providence. That he, who a little before was generally esteem'd the Head, and Protector of all the Factious in the Kingdom, whom he vouchsafed to distinguish and Honour by the Title of Worthy Men, and the Terror and Scourges of all the Good, and the Loyal, whom he mark'd out, and design'd for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44330:23"/>
Destruction and Slaughter, under the Name of Men worthy: He who, in his own conceit, had so much the absolute disposal of the Hearts and Hands of all the Disaffected, as to be able to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Establish'd Government, when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and had really once gone very far to effect it, had not his own Presumption Defeated his Malice; That this very Man, having seen all his hopes, and contrivances dash'd in Pieces at home, should have nothing left to do, but to take shelter, in that Commonwealth, which in his former Greatness, he had so mortally provok'd; there to lead a Life of Disgrace and Misery, and to Dye neglected in a Country of which he had formerly express'd so great a Hatred: And yet still retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much Venemous Rancour against his most Gracious Master, as to profess with his last Breath, that he had deservedly receiv'd his Deaths Wound, meaning the bruise in his Side and now his Death in that Country, where he had done his own so much Mischief; When he was one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners sent thither, in the Year 1660, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite his Majesty home freely and without Terms.</p>
            <p>After this, though the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was gone, yet the impressions of Mischief he had left behind on the minds of the Confederates, would not so easily vanish. They soon reflected on his last advise, that so, many having been made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to the Design, they should certainly find more safety in pushing it on boldly, than in too late a Retreat. Upon this immediately they recover'd their Spirits and Resolution, which his hasty flight had somewhat Damp'd; thenceforth they renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Consultations with greater vigour than
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44330:23"/>
before: The Principal Managers having their frequent Meetings, as also the inferior Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments theirs; whilst some of each Number gave secret intimations to the other of what was passing in their separate Assemblies.</p>
            <p>Of the great Council of Six, the Consults that have been hitherto plainly testifi'd and sworn to, were those at Mr. <hi>Hambdens,</hi> at the Lord <hi>Russels,</hi> and at Mr. <hi>Shepherds.</hi> The Subordinate Cabals were kept in divers places in and about the City; As in the <hi>December</hi> of that Year, at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Romzey</hi>'s House in the <hi>Soho</hi> Square; in the next <hi>February</hi> at <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber in the Temple, about which time it was agreed that <hi>Ferguson</hi> should be sent for, as he was, and came over ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Then their Meetings were more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon the Kings being at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and after: Usually at <hi>West</hi>'s Lodgings, for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of its situation; Or in common Taverns; As at the <hi>Miter</hi> within <hi>Aldgate;</hi> The <hi>Horse-Shooe</hi> on <hi>Tower-Hill;</hi> The <hi>Fortune</hi> at <hi>Wapping;</hi> The <hi>Syracusa-</hi>House; The <hi>Kings-head</hi> in <hi>Atheist-Alley;</hi> the <hi>Salutation</hi> and the <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Lumbard-Street</hi> on <hi>June</hi> the Twelfth, the very Day of the Discovery, they met at the <hi>Sun-Tavern</hi> behind the <hi>Exchange;</hi> on <hi>June</hi> 14 they met at <hi>Bailly</hi> of <hi>Jerviswood</hi>'s Chamber, and again in <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew-Lane,</hi> and at the <hi>Green-Dragon</hi> on <hi>Snow-hill;</hi> and so continued to do some where or other, till they totally dispers'd from <hi>Walcot</hi>'s Lodging in <hi>Goodman</hi>'s <hi>Fields.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Meetings being so generally in places of Publick Entertainment; Therefore to prevent the Observation of Drawers and Servants, they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44330:24"/>
often discours'd of their whole Bloody Business, in a Canting Language of their own making.</p>
            <p>The King was sometimes call'd the <hi>Church-Warden</hi> of <hi>Whitehall:</hi> The King and Duke the <hi>Black-Bird</hi> and the <hi>Gold-Finch;</hi> the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant.</hi> Provisions of Arms, as <hi>Blunderbusses, Muskets, Pistols,</hi> were talk'd of, under the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd Names of <hi>Swan-Quills, Goose-Quills, Crow-Quills.</hi> The Insurrection was styled the <hi>General Point,</hi> the Assassination the <hi>Lopping Point,</hi> and striking at the Head. And because several of the Conspirators were Lawyers, it was sometimes agreed, that their wicked intentions against the King and the Duke, should be veil'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the terms of Disseising him in Possession, and barring him in Remainder: At other times the Killing of both pass'd for executing a Bargain and Sale, as being a short manner of conveyance; and the Rising in Arms, as the longer, and more tedious way, for executing a Lease and Release. The Villains thus wantonly abusing the Innocent Terms of the excellent Profession of the common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> to cover their horrid Designs against his Majesties Person and Crown, whose Preservation and Prosperity is the great end, and sense of all those Laws.</p>
            <p>But for the most part, when they were free and amongst themselves, they discours'd of the whole contrivance in plain Language, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reserve: their common Healths being such as these; <hi>To the Man who first draws his Sword against Popery and Slavery, in defence of the Protestant Religion. Confusion to the two Brothers, Popery and Slavery;</hi> explaining the same to be meant of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44330:24"/>
the Royal Brothers of <hi>Whitehal.</hi> And when some of them, who were less harden'd in Cruelty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd some kind of consternation and dread of the Consequences of so dire a Stroak, and desir'd the Infamy of it might be thrown on the Papists; others, particularly <hi>Ferguson,</hi> declared, <hi>They thought the Action too good to have the Papists carry away the Honour of it;</hi> and often applauded it as a <hi>Glorious Work; That it would be an Admonition to all Princes to take heed how they Oppressed their Subjects; That he hoped to see the Fact rewarded by a Parliament, and the Actors in it have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Statues erected to them, and the Title of Preservers of their Country.</hi> So also when <hi>Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp, Walcot</hi> and some few others readily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd themselves willing to joyn in the Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but shrunk a little at first at the horrour of the Assassination, <hi>R. Rumbald</hi> and <hi>R. Goodenough</hi> with monstrous impiety maintain'd the Kings and the Dukes Murder as the more pious Design of the two, and recommended it as keeping one of the Ten Commandments, and the best way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent shedding Christian Blood.</p>
            <p>In these their private Cabals, the Matters they promiscuously treated of, were either a general Insurrection, or the Assassination of the Kings and his Royal Highnesses Persons. Of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassination divers ways were consulted, till they fix'd on that of the <hi>Rye.</hi> The Insurrection was proposed to be made at the same time in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> The adjusting that part of it, which related to <hi>Scotland,</hi> was chiefly under the care of the Council of Six, and manag'd by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of both Nations sitting in <hi>London:</hi> All
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44330:25"/>
which Particulars are so circumstantially set forth, so often repeated, and demonstrably confirm'd in the ensuing Evidences, that it will be sufficient here only to direct the Readers Observation, by giving a brief Summary of the whole.</p>
            <p>Towards an Insurrection throughout <hi>England,</hi> they laid the greatest stress on the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> not doubting but if that were once secur'd to them, the rest of the Nation must of course fall in; taking incouragement and example in this, as in many other things, from the cursed Methods of the Unnatural Rebellion in the late Kings time.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> therefore was carefully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by them into Twenty parts; and to that purpose one of the largest Maps of the City and Liberties was hung up in <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber, the most usual place of their Rendezvouzes; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the several Partitions and Allotments of the whole, being committed to <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> who by reason of his universal acquaintance, as having been so often Under-Sheriff, was judg'd the fittest Man of the whole Party for that Work.</p>
            <p>The City being thus divided, it was agreed, that every Division should be assign'd to some one principal Man of greatest Trust, Courage and Conduct; each of those Twenty was to chuse Nine or Ten, or more, in whom they could confide. These were to have the inspection of the several Under-walks, and from time to time to make returns of their Numbers and Strength; and when the List was finish'd, it was to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the supreme Managers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:44330:25"/>
By this means they made no question but they should have a select Body of at least Eight or Ten Thousand approved and well appointed Men to make the first Onset; <hi>Goodenough</hi> alone having assur'd them, that out of seven Divisions only, there were 3000 Resolute Men prepar'd to be ready at an hours warning.</p>
            <p>For the increasing their Numbers, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in new Converts, this one general Rule was carefully prescribed, That the bottom of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign should in the beginning be warily conceal'd from all Persons with whom they treated. First their Inclinations were to be try'd by gradual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations, and plausible Discourses at a distance, till they had gain'd a full assurance of their Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. They were to be ask'd, <hi>What they would, or could do, in case of a Foreign Invasion?</hi> When it was answer'd, <hi>They would readily assist against any Common Enemy:</hi> Then it was next to be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Whether they would contribute the assistance of their Persons, or Purses, or both?</hi> That being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so determined, it was to be farther inquired, <hi>What Furniture of Arms, Horses, and Money they had in readiness? What Friends they could engage?</hi> And if these Questions were resolved according to their Minds, then the whole Mystery of the Villany was to be frankly disclosed. They were to be told in down-right terms, That there was already an Oppression and Force upon all they had; That there was an actual Invasion on the English Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, Properties and Consciences: That the only Obligation the Subject has to the King, is a Mutual Covenant; That this Covenant was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly broken on the Kings part; That therefore
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44330:26"/>
the People were free from all Oaths, or other tyes of Fealty and Allegiance, and had the Natural Liberty restored to them of asserting their own Rights, and as justly at least against a Domestick, as against Foreign Invaders.</p>
            <p>The way being thus made to sound and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Dispositions of ill Men for any Violent Enterprize; the next thing that came under De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation was Mony. For that, several of the particular Conspirators declared, they had consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Sums of their own, or deposited with them, which were ready, and might be call'd for on Occasion; That great Subscriptions had been made of divers Thousands of Pounds, which when the time of Action drew neer, were to be distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongst the Chief of the Twenty Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; That this would be enough to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for a sudden Push: But if the business succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Half a Years Rent of the <hi>Chimney-Mony</hi> would be due, besides what the <hi>Excise-Office</hi> and the <hi>Custom-House</hi> might afford: That all the Mony and Plate in <hi>Lumbard-street,</hi> and what was in the possession of the Bankers, Goldsmiths, and other Wealthy Men in <hi>London,</hi> or the Suburbs, was either to be seiz'd on as a just Forfeiture, or Borrowed under the Name of the Old, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated Cheat of the Publick Faith. Particularly <hi>Ferguson,</hi> whose constant Custom it was, in all their Consults, to out-do all the rest by some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Circumstance of Cruelty of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, added on this Head, That little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to be expected from the Old Rich Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; that therefore Five or Six of them were to be kill'd at first, and their Estates given to the Mobile, to terrifie the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44330:26"/>
The next necessary Provision they debated on was Arms. And it is notoriously known, the whole Party had for a long time before, been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering great abundance of all Sorts: All proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with the same prospect, and in the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for their Parts in the Conspiracy, as the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> had done for his, though they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd not all to be so manifestly detected. For a good while before any Conspiracy was suspected by his Majesty, or his Ministers, the said Lord was found to have by him, hid under other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Furniture in a dark Garret, above Fourscore Compleat Arms in his Private City-House, where no open Robbery or Assault could be fear'd; and by consequence, there could not be the least shadow of pretence that they were laid in there for his own lawful use or defence.</p>
            <p>But besides these Stores, which they had every one made for themselves; it was resolv'd at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry first to attempt the Publick Magazines in and about the City; Particularly that in the <hi>Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Ground,</hi> where a considerable Number of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Arms were commonly kept without a Guard, for the frequent exercises of the Citizens.</p>
            <p>Many thoughts also were spent how to engage the Seamen to their Side. To this end several Riotous Meetings were made at <hi>Wapping,</hi> the greatest Men amongst them not disdaining there to Feast and Cajole the Rabble; often styling that Scum of People they there met with, their honest <hi>Wapping</hi> Friends. Besides this, some Sea Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were tamper'd with, and a Golden Ball was proposed to be hurl'd upon <hi>Black-Heath;</hi> none questioning but the Seamen, assembled at that sport,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44330:27"/>
would declare for them as one Man; upon a groundless fancy, that they were of themselves highly discontented, and ready to Mutiny for want of Pay.</p>
            <p>Though it must be said, and his Majesty does hereby publickly own, that their Practises with the Seamen met with the least success of any. Nor is it imaginable, the brave Race of English Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners should ever prove false to his Majesty, who has cherish'd, incourag'd, and promoted that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession more than all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have done since the Conquest; his Majesty well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that the Safety, Riches and Honour of this Kingdom depend most on its Maritime Greatness.</p>
            <p>However, the Conspirators not in the least doubting but they should have sufficient Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to make a stand, and give time to others to come in, and declare; their Rendezvouses were appointed in the chief Piazza's, and most of the convenient Posts of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster;</hi> whence they might at once Attack the <hi>Bridge,</hi> the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes,</hi> the Guards, the <hi>Savoy, Whitehal</hi> and the <hi>Tower;</hi> and they had ready in Town about 100 of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s old Officers to Head and Govern the mixt Multitude as soon as they should appear in Arms.</p>
            <p>At the same time a Party of 500 Horse was to come out of the Country to scour the Streets; and immediately Barricadoes were to be made: the Horses of Hackney-Coaches, and other Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were to be seiz'd on: the Horse-Guards not actually mounted to be surpriz'd in their several
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44330:27"/>
Stables: the Churches to be broken open, and used as St. <hi>Pauls</hi> was in the late times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferguson</hi> had also often assur'd them, he could promise for three hundred Scots to be ready at a day; affirming, that such a Number, most of them <hi>Bothwel-Bridge</hi> Men, resided about Town, as Journey-men in divers Trades, and were to be commanded by Ten or Twelve Gentlemen of that Nation: Adding, that some hundreds more went about the Country with Packs, taking that way to get and carry Intelligence, as well as for a Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood.</p>
            <p>Upon supposition of this Strength, <hi>Whitehal</hi> was to be assaulted at once by one Party from the <hi>Strand,</hi> by another on the back-side from <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and on the River by Water-Men in Boats with Hand-Granadoes. And in confidence that his Majesty and the whole Court would speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either be taken or fly, there were distinct Parties assign'd to way-lay them on the Road either to <hi>Windsor</hi> or <hi>Portsmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their principal Aim being to surprize the <hi>Tower,</hi> as a place most able to annoy them, and where there lay great Magazines and Stores of Ammunition to furnish them, they had many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of Stratagems proposed on that subject.</p>
            <p>One was to be perform'd by Night, by firing a parcel of Fagots to burn down the Gates, whilst a strong Party without was to be ready to make a brisk Attack in the first Confusion of the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>Another to be Executed about Two in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, thus; One party privately Arm'd was to go see the Armory, another the Lions: The
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44330:28"/>
first to return into the Sutler's House by the Gate: At the same time, some were to come in Coaches on pretence of visiting the Lords then Prisoners: Those in the Sutler's House were to Issue out, and kill a Horse, or overthrow a Coach just in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. Then both parties to joyn, and seize on the Guards; and by a sign given, upon the Coaches over-turning, Two or Three Hundred Men, lodg'd in Houses thereby, were to come in and Second the rest.</p>
            <p>Another was, that some of the Conspirators, as Constables, and Officers of Justice, should bring in others as Offendors, and that several should enter feined Actions one against the other in St. <hi>Catharines-Court,</hi> then held in the <hi>Tower:</hi> On the Court Day others were to come in as Plantiffs, Defendents, and Witnesses, who joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with those that seem'd to come out of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, all these might be seconded by a like party prepar'd from without; the over-turning a Coach being likewise made use of in this Case. Which soever of these ways should happen to be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: The Lord <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> Master-General of the Ordnance was immediately to be dispatch'd, as one whose Bravery and Courage they fear'd would prompt him to Blow up the Great Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of Powder there, and so Bury them with himself in the Ruine, if he found he could not otherways resist them.</p>
            <p>Besides securing to themselves by these means the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> which was their greatest Care; they had also under Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the Raising Commotions at the same time in divers others parts of <hi>England:</hi> Especially in those
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44330:28"/>
Counties of the <hi>West</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Progresses had most inclined to their Factious Interest.</p>
            <p>In every County some one Great Man was to put himself at the Head of the Rebellion, and divers of them had their proper Stations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>Particularly of <hi>Newcastle</hi> they made themselves sure; and laid great stress upon it, by reason of its vicinity to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the influence its Coal-Pits have on the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Cheshire</hi> they depended on a numerous assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; that being the County, in which the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had formerly advised the Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction should begin, and a Free Parliament be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd for, at the time of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s going thither in one of his Mock-Triumphs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Portsmouth</hi> was to be attempted by some going into the Town on pretence of seeing the place; at the same time another Party coming in on the Market-day, disguis'd like Country-Men, and both together were to fall on the Guards.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Taunton</hi> they expected great Numbers, remembring the old Disloyalty of the Inhabitants, which they had evidenc'd by a most remarkable insolence; having presumed for some Years after his Majesties most happy Restoration, to keep so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly a Day of Thanksgiving to God for raising the Siege which his Father had laid against the Parliaments Rebellious Forces in that Town.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Bristol</hi> they had secured a good Party, which they doubted not might easily Master the City; as manifestly appears by the full Confession of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi> Citizen of <hi>Bristol,</hi> which he freely made
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44330:29"/>
upon his very first Examination, and afterwards confirm'd at his Execution, when he could not have the least hope of Pardon to be obtain'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p>At the same time when they were making these Preparations for an Insurrection, the other design of Assassinating his Majesty and his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness kept equal pace with it.</p>
            <p>It is manifest that some of these very Men had often before devised the Kings and his Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Murder divers ways. For besides what <hi>Hone</hi> confess'd of the Proposal to shoot them from <hi>Bow-Steeple;</hi> and another Project of destroying them the next Lord Mayor's Day before, which was laid aside upon notice that his Majesty and his Brother intended not to be there; and besides <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Rumbald</hi>'s Invention of blowing up the Play-House, when they should both be present; the said <hi>Rumbald</hi> inform'd his Confederates, that he and some of his Friends had resolv'd to cut off the King and the Duke in their Journey to, or from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> above ten Years before; and had layn sometime in ambush to that purpose, but without effect, because, as God would have it, his Majesty and his Royal Brother then unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly went the other way through the Forest; which, as the Wretch himself could not but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, they have seldom or never done before or since.</p>
            <p>And now also, upon this occasion, divers ways of performing the Assassination were debated. One was to make the attempt on them in St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park,</hi> as they were passing privately, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times almost alone to St. <hi>James</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:44330:29"/>
Another, when they should be going down the River for their Divertisement, either to sink the Barge by over-running it with an Hoy, or by bord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on a sudden, and Shooting out some Planks with Blunderbusses.</p>
            <p>Another, to plant Men in the Pit at the <hi>Play-House,</hi> who should be ready to Shoot at them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, with Pocket Blunderbusses, two of which <hi>Rumzey</hi> sent his to Majesty.</p>
            <p>Another, to do it in their return thence to <hi>Whitehal,</hi> under <hi>Bedford-Wall</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> where one part of the Assassines might walk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suspected in the Piazza, a Second within the Rails, a Third in the Church-Porch; and all Issue forth in an Instant, to compass the Coaches, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the Business, or do the Trick, as they styl'd it.</p>
            <p>It was also proposed to be undertaken between <hi>Windsor</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> or in their going to <hi>Winchester,</hi> or if the Royal Brothers should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be present at the Bull-Feast in <hi>Red-Lyon-Fields.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all these other propositions, as subject to far more Casualties and Hazards, soon gave place to that of the <hi>Rye</hi> in <hi>Hartfordshire:</hi> A House then inhabited by the foresaid <hi>Richard Rumbald;</hi> who proposed that to be the Seat of the Action, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himself to Command the Party, that was to do the Work. Him therefore, as their most da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Captain, and by reason of a Blemish in one of his Eyes, they were afterwards wont, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Discourse, to call <hi>Hannibal:</hi> Often Drinking Healths to <hi>Hannibal and his Boys;</hi> meaning <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> and his Hellish Crew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:44330:30"/>
The commodiousness of the <hi>Rye</hi> for any such desperate Enterprize soon incourag'd them to fix it there: Its lonely and retir'd Situation, and the Inclosures about it being such as would afford all advantages imaginable to the Assailants, and give as great Inconveniences to the Persons attacked.</p>
            <p>The place being agreed on, it was first questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, whether the stroke should be struck, upon his Majesties going to, or coming from <hi>Newmarket:</hi> But it was thought more expedient to defer it till his Majesties return.</p>
            <p>That point being over, they had several Meetings, to consult of all the Circumstances of the Parricide.</p>
            <p>The Number of the Men to be personally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged were Forty at Least, to that end two or three Lists of Names were drawn up, out of which the choice was to be made, and the Roll was neer completed.</p>
            <p>The Arms to be used were Blunderbusses, Muskets, Pistols, Carabines. To get them down thither without suspicion, many ways were thought on. One, to put them up in Chests, and bring them by Land in Carts. Another, to hide them in a Boat, under Coals, or Oysters, or such common Lading, and so to convey them up the River of <hi>Ware.</hi> Another, that every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd should go down privily Arm'd, and so all Travelling in small Parties, scatter'd, and at their leisure, they might easily meet unperceived about the <hi>Rye;</hi> at the time prefixt.</p>
            <p>When the Fatal Hour should approach, the attempt was agreed to be made in this manner. Some one or two were to be sent forth on the Road
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44330:30"/>
towards <hi>Newmarket,</hi> to discover in which Coach the King came, and what Company attended him; which they well knew was commonly no more than some six of the Guards; and those also were supposed to have their Horses weak, and almost tired by that time they came thither, so near <hi>Hodsdon,</hi> one of the usual Stages where his Majesty was wont to change Coaches and Guards.</p>
            <p>Upon warning thus given of the Kings being near at hand, all were to be in readiness within the House and Yards to issue forth in a moment; some on Horseback, some on Foot.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon the Coaches coming within the Gates and Hedges about the House, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators were to divide into several Parties: Some before in the habit of Labourers were to overthrow a Cart in the narrowest passage, so to prevent all possibility of escape: Others were to fight the Guards, <hi>Walcot</hi> chusing that part upon a Puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio of Honour: Others were to shoot at the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Postilion and Horses: Others to aim only at his Majesties Coach, which party was to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the particular direction of <hi>Rumbald</hi> himself; the Villain declaring before-hand, That upon that occasion he would make use of a very good Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuss, which was in <hi>West</hi>'s possession, most blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously adding, that <hi>Ferguson</hi> should first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate it.</p>
            <p>It is indeed a thing prodigious to tell, and were it not for the undeniable proofs of it, very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be believ'd, that not only one or two such Furies should rise up in a whole Age, but that so great a Number of Men should, in the same time and place, be found so void of all Humanity, as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44330:31"/>
not only to imagine and contrive so horrid a Fact, but to discourse of it in so many Meetings, so sportfully and merrily as they did, as if the cruellest Tragedy which wicked Men or the Devil ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, had been only a matter of common pastime and loose raillery. Thus when at one of their Consults <hi>West</hi> invited <hi>Rumzey</hi> to be Godfather to his Child, he answered, <hi>He would, if he might be allow'd to call him</hi> Brutus. And when it was once proposed to Kill the King and the Duke at the <hi>Play-House,</hi> by blowing up the whole Audience with them, <hi>Ferguson</hi> approved the way, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently said, <hi>That then they would Die in their own Calling.</hi> And when some objected against it, <hi>That by this means the Innocent would perish with the Nocent;</hi> another justified it, saying, <hi>What did the Jack-Daws do amongst the Rooks?</hi> And when some proposed that to give a better colour to what they did, the King and Duke should not be killed, but only seiz'd and brought to Tryal, after that the People had got the better; It was answer'd by <hi>Ferguson, That it was never thought Injustice to shoot, or set Traps for Wolves and Tygers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The execrable Deed being thus suppos'd by them to be feasible without much Opposition, they then farther consider'd the several ways of their escaping afterwards. Sometimes they thought of retreating towards <hi>Cambridgeshire,</hi> and scattering there; sometimes of retiring into the <hi>Rye-House,</hi> which being guarded with a Moat, and Brick-Walls, they doubted not to defend it against the frighted Country People for some Hours till Night, when they might shift for themselves, and disperse. Another way that <hi>Rumbald</hi> himself
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44330:31"/>
proposed, was to lead them out of the great Road through the Meadows, which were to be gallop'd all along; so that they might with ease come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Hackney-Marsh,</hi> before the News of what was done could possibly get thither. It was concluded at the same time, that divers Lords, and principal Men of their Party, should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to an Entertainment that very day in the City, that they might be upon the place to Head the Faction at the first arrival of the News.</p>
            <p>But whilst they were thus wholly intent on this barbarous Work, and proceeded securely in its Contrivance, without any the least doubt of a prosperous success; Behold! on a sudden God miraculously disappointed all their Hopes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, by the terrible Conflagration, unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaking out at <hi>Newmarket.</hi> In which extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary event, there was one most remarkable passage, that is not so generally taken notice of, as for the Glory of God, and the Confusion of his Majesties Enemies it ought to be.</p>
            <p>For after that the approaching fury of the Flames had driven the King out of his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, his Majesty at first removed into another Quarter of the Town, remote from the Fire, and as yet free from any annoyance of Smoke and Ashes. There his Majesty finding he might be tolerably well accommodated, had resolved to stay, and continue his Recreations as before, till the Day first named for his Journey back to <hi>London.</hi> But his Majesty had no sooner made that resolution, when the Wind, as conducted by an invisible Power from above, presently chang'd about, and blew the Smoke and Cinders directly on his new Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44330:32"/>
making them in a moment as untenable as the other. Upon this, his Majesty being put to a new shift, and not finding the like Conveniency else-where, immediately declared he would speedily return to <hi>Whitehal;</hi> as he did: which happening to be several days before the Assassines expected him, or their preparations for the <hi>Rye</hi> were in readiness, it may justly give occasion to all the World to acknowledge what one of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conspirators could not but do, <hi>That it was a Providential Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now upon the first notice in Town of the Fire at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and that by consequence the King would be necessitated to come home sooner than was imagin'd, the principal Assassines were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd by <hi>Ferguson</hi> to a Meeting that very Night.</p>
            <p>They at first receiv'd the News with various Apprehensions and Motions of Mind, looking on one another with much Astonishment and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Amongst the rest, <hi>Walcot</hi> acknowledg'd, <hi>He thought it an Expression of Gods disapproving the Undertaking:</hi> whilst <hi>Ferguson,</hi> without any sign of the least relenting, said, <hi>That he perceiv'd God had reserv'd his Majesty for his own Judgment.</hi> However that Evening they generally agreed, That since Arms, Horses and Men could not be provided in so short a space, because the King was daily expected, and the day of his coming uncertain, therefore all farther thoughts of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness should be laid aside for that time.</p>
            <p>Yet the next Morning, the Company being again assembled, upon Reports spread abroad that his Majesty purpos'd to retire to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and stay there some days, <hi>Ferguson</hi> vehemently insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44330:32"/>
               <hi>That the Design should instantly be reassum'd; That what could be, should be done in so narrow a time.</hi> And particularly <hi>Armstrong</hi> offer'd himself to go down in person to the <hi>Rye</hi> in order to it, if a Sum of Money could be presently rais'd, and a competent number of Men got together.</p>
            <p>But the noise of the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Journey soon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, put an end to those Deliberations; though it was a constant expectation and whisper among the Party, that something extraordinary would be done on the very day of his Majesties coming home.</p>
            <p>In these uncertainties they remain'd till the King came; and some days after <hi>R. Rumbald</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Rye,</hi> increas'd their rage for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, by telling them, <hi>That he saw his Majesty and his Royal Highness pass by his House but very slenderly guarded, only with five or six Persons, and those tired, and ill appointed; so that he doubted not but with the like number of stout and well-arm'd Men, he might easily have taken them both off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this, presently after at their next Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings it was agreed, That to prepare against any such disappointment for the future, a sufficient Number of Arms should be bought, and kept in readiness for any other opportunity, if such could be found during any of his Majesties Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that Summer; or at farthest in his next going to <hi>Newmarket.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpose <hi>West</hi> told them he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a very good Gun-smith, and took upon himself to provide the Arms; <hi>Ferguson</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to pay the Money for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:44330:33"/>
Accordingly <hi>West</hi> bought Thirty Case of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols, Thirty Carabines, and Ten Blunderbusses of one <hi>Daft</hi> a Gun-smith in <hi>Shooe-Lane;</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guson</hi> paid him for them about three weeks before the Discovery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>West</hi>'s pretence of buying so great a quantity of Arms, was to send them into <hi>America,</hi> where he had a Plantation; and to disguise the business the better, he caus'd them to be sanguin'd, in shew to preserve them from Rust in so long a Voyage, and had them made up in Sea-Chests, as ready to be Transported.</p>
            <p>So they continu'd till after the noise of <hi>Keeling</hi>'s having betray'd all. Then <hi>West</hi> to avoid suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion sent them to a Sea-Captain, setting Sail for the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> but without any Bill of Lading or Consignment, as is usual; in whose Custody the Arms were seiz'd, and delivered into his Majesties Stores, to be there kept for a better use.</p>
            <p>In these their several Consults many casual Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses interven'd, relating indifferently either to the Insurrection or Assassination: As, What Commissions were at first requisite to be given out, and in what style they were to run. What Declaration was to be immediately publish'd to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the Fact. What Project of Government to be pitch'd on, and setled afterwards.</p>
            <p>It was agreed that the Commissions for this Nation should be issued forth in the Name of the Confederate Lords and Commons of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For preparing a Declaration, divers of their Number were order'd to bring in their Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons apart, out of all which Collection, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44330:33"/>
Remonstrance was to be gather'd by some of their ablest Heads.</p>
            <p>The main drift of the whole was to amuse the Peoples Fancies for a Time with new Chimera's of Freedom from Taxes, and Advantages for Trade, and Moderation of Law Expenses, and a Toleration of all Sects; then to calumniate the Royal Family for divers Generations past; to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse his Majesty as a Tyrant and Oppressor, and to accuse all his Faithful Subjects, as servile Instruments of Arbitrary Power, and Betrayers of their Country: Whilst they and their Party were to be magnified, as the only Asserters and Restorers of Liberties, Properties, and the True Protestant Religion. Their design in all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same that has been constantly put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise by all promoters of Sedition and Treason in all Ages; Who have always thought they have done more than Half their business, if they can but once appropriate to themselves all the Good and pleasing Words of things plausible and popular; and fasten on the Government the Names and Titles of things vulgarly odious, or contemptible.</p>
            <p>Touching the new Form of Government to be set up in stead of the old, they were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so unanimous, that being also natural to all Schisms and Factions, that tho they may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times agree in what they would ruine, yet they never did, nor can long consent in what they shall settle.</p>
            <p>Some were still for retaining a shew of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, though with such Restrictions as would make the Prince little better than a Duke of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:44330:34"/>
Others were positively for a Common-Wealth, and the entire subversion of the present constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, openly declaring, it was their purpose not only to change Names, but Things.</p>
            <p>Nay upon this point, some of them doubted not frequently to profess in plain Terms, <hi>That if their great Darling, the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>should be squeamish,</hi> as they worded it, <hi>in approving and Confirming what had been done in Heat of Blood, then he himself should fare no better than the rest, when their Swords were in their Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A sufficient Admonition to all Men of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Estate, how hazardous their condition is, and how mean their Servitude, whilst they are heading popular Tumults; tho for a little time perhaps they may seem to others, and fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to have an absolute sway over them.</p>
            <p>But their particular Head of Discourse in which the Conspirators chiefly delighted, and were wont in their Meetings most amply to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their inventions, was concerning their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of several kinds of vengeance to be Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on those Eminent Persons of all Professions, whom they thought most capable and willing to oppose their Bloody Enterprize.</p>
            <p>In that part indeed their Passion transported them beyond all bounds of common Prudence, even to the highest Degree of ridiculous Vanity, and extravagant Ostentation of their full assurance to succeed in the dire Attempt.</p>
            <p>Having first Gloried in the Imagination of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruing their Hands in Royal Blood, they scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled not to profess they would continue the Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sination on all the principal Officers of the Crown,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44330:34"/>
and Ministers of Justice; and spightfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all Circumstances imaginable which they thought might aggravate the Terrour or Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Punishment.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John More,</hi> the Lord Mayor of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Year, and Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi> the Lord Mayor, and Mr. <hi>North</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs of that present Year, were concluded fit to be Murder'd, and their Skins stuff'd and hung up in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> for a dreadful Warning to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Alderman <hi>Cornish</hi> or <hi>Gould</hi> was to be declared Lord Mayor; <hi>Papillion</hi> and <hi>Dubois</hi> Sheriffs: If they refused, they were to undergo as bad a fate. Some others also were doom'd to the like destiny, who might think they deserved well of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their Moderation. But they resolved that Neuters should be treated as ill as their most avow'd Enemies.</p>
            <p>Most of the Judges were to be kill'd for their pretended Illegal and Arbitrary Judgments, and their Skins in the same manner hung up in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of the principal Abhorrers, Addressers, and reputed Pensioners in the late Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (under which Titles in their Modern Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious Language they had been us'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the most steddy Adherents to the Crown, and True Sons of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> were to be brought to Tryal, and Death: The Skins too of those they styled Pensio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were to be hung up in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44330:35"/>
The Church-men they hated, and despised in general, as Men whose Interest could never be divided from the Crown, and of course would fall with it.</p>
            <p>The Marquiss of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Rochester,</hi> Sir <hi>Leolyn Jenkins,</hi> the Lord Keeper, and divers others who had been his Majesties most faithful Councellors in the time of extream hazard, were nam'd as Men whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction was certain, and who could not possibly escape the first rage of the Massacre. Particularly it was determin'd the Lord Keeper should be sent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and hang'd on the same Gallows on which the Infamous <hi>College</hi> had been Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
            <p>In this furious manner they proceeded to lay about them in their common Discourses with all the Infernal Malice that is so agreeable to their Principles, and inseparable from them; there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver having yet been found, in all Records of Time, any pretended Conscientious Zeal, but it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways most certainly attended with a fierce Spirit of implacable Cruelty.</p>
            <p>During all this time, as it cannot be imagin'd that either of the Cabals was altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with what the other was doing; so it is manifest, some of their great Men understood the dark Hints that were sometimes given them, of <hi>Striking at the Head,</hi> and <hi>Shortning the Work by removing two Persons:</hi> And also that these Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Instruments proceeded on assurance, That <hi>when they came to Action, they should be Headed by Men of much higher Quality and Condition than as yet openly appear'd amongst them.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:44330:35"/>
Wherefore of the Debates and Resolutions of their great Council, thus much has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy testified upon Oath: That shortly after that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> fled, it was thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, for the furtherance of the Design pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in his time, that a small Select Number of the most eminent Heads of the Party, in and about <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> should be united into a close Cabal, or secret Council; who might have their frequent Assemblies, and be ready, on all occasions, to guide and direct the motions of the Lower Agents.</p>
            <p>The Persons, who undertook this Universal care and inspection, were the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Colonel <hi>Alger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Sydney,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Hambden</hi> Junior. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, <hi>Romzey, Armstrong, Ferguson, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard</hi> and some others, were admitted, as occasion serv'd, on some particular Debates.</p>
            <p>Their first Meeting was in <hi>January</hi> of that Year at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s House: Where some general Heads were propounded of things to be resolv'd on, in their more mature thoughts. As, Where the Insurrection should first be made, in City or Country, or in both at once: What Counties were most disposed for Action: What places would be most proper for their Rendezvouses: What Arms were necessary, how to be provided, where to be laid in: What Mony needful at first to be rais'd, and where to be deposited, so as to Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster no Ground of Jealousie: And by what means the discontented Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> might be brought into the Confederacy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:44330:36"/>
This last was look'd on as the principal Point, and deserving their first Direction. Wherefore at their next Meeting about ten days after, at the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s House, they began with conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a way of Setling an Intelligence with the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> beyond the Seas, and with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this a Messenger was Ordered to be sent into <hi>Scotland:</hi> It was committed to Colonel <hi>Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> to choose the Person, and to furnish him with Instructions.</p>
            <p>The Man chosen by Mr. <hi>Sydney,</hi> at the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Nelthrop,</hi> for his known merits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Cause, was <hi>Aaron Smith.</hi> The Sum given him to defray his Expenses, was Three, or Fourscore Guinea's. The substance of his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage was to invite up Sir <hi>John Cockran,</hi> the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells</hi> of <hi>Cessnock</hi> and some others, to treat in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Information stops. For then the managers seem'd to agree amongst themselves to have no more constant Assemblies, till the return of the Messenger. Tho since it appears, the said Lord was thereafter excluded from their Consultations, for having been too la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish with his Tongue, in reporting abroad what had been there transacted.</p>
            <p>However it has been proved by unquestionable Evidence, that presently after this, <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> did set forth towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> arrived there the Spring of that Year; and by some indiscretion had like to have spoil'd the whole business: Which to recover, and to remove all suspicions, <hi>Cockran</hi> was forc'd to present himself before the Council of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:44330:36"/>
Afterwards he and his Companions came to Town, and the Negotiation was warmly set on Foot: In the mean time <hi>Cockran</hi> and the rest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten attended at <hi>Windsor</hi> to make their Court, one day kissing the King's and the Duke's Hands, the next consulting with the English Cabal; all in shew to sollicit the Interest of <hi>Carolina,</hi> whilst they really intended a Business of far greater Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which was, in their own Language, <hi>To see what could be done for the delivery of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time the late Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> for his part had deputed some of his Confidents hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to attend the issue of those Debates, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present his Proposals, and to transmit to him the Results of their Counsels; the whole corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence between them being veil'd under a style of Merchandize.</p>
            <p>The Treaty being thus begun, some general Things were easily agreed on by all sides. The Scots were to rise first; the English to have notice of it with all possible speed, then to second them here: The Rebellion in both Kingdoms to be before Harvest: Arms and Ammunition to be transported out of <hi>Holland: Argyle</hi> to go with them and Head the Rising.</p>
            <p>These things being quickly pass'd over, some other Matters endured a longer contest; and one unseasonable Dispute had like to have broken all. The English Commissioners requir'd, <hi>They should presently declare for a Commonwealth and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Monarchy;</hi> which the Scots refused, protesting <hi>The generality of their People would never hearken to that at first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:44330:37"/>
But the great Point on which the Conclusion of the whole depended, was the Sum of Money to be rais'd, and intrusted with the Scots to lay out: The Sum at first demanded was Thirty Thousand Pounds; that sunk afterwards to Ten Thousand; But for the raising of this, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish made several delays and scruples, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to trust their Scotch Brethren with any thing but Money.</p>
            <p>Upon this Contrast the Treaty was often on and off; the Scots talking high, objecting to the English, <hi>That they were only good at Fire-side Plotting; whereas for their part they were resolv'd to rise, though they had nothing but their Claws to fight with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length they came to an Agreement, <hi>That the Ten Thousand Pounds should be rais'd, and put into the Hands of</hi> Shepard, <hi>who was to return the Bills for it by</hi> Ferguson <hi>or</hi> Baillie <hi>to</hi> Amsterdam.</p>
            <p>After this manner was the whole Conspiracy going on, when the Discovery overtook it. For now the happy Twelfth of <hi>June</hi> was come. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah Keeling</hi> had sworn to his first Deposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins:</hi> But finding that his Majesty and his Ministers were exceeding diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his single intelligence in a business of so vast a Moment, he consider'd which way he might best strengthen his Evidence. To that end he prevail'd with <hi>Goodenough,</hi> who had an entire confidence in him, that his Brother <hi>John Keeling</hi> might be admitted into the next Meetings of the Conspirators, he himself promising to be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his Secrecy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:44330:37"/>
This was done, and thereupon both the Brothers gave in their joint Testimony upon Oath on the 14 of <hi>June,</hi> touching the progress of the Treason. So they continued to do for a day or two more, till <hi>John Keeling</hi> let fall some Expressions to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which they whisper'd about among their Fanatick Acquaintance, <hi>That,</hi> as they call'd it, <hi>something was working which might do mischief to honest People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That being rumour'd about, came quickly to the Knowledge of some of the Conspirators. Upon this they immediately assembled, and <hi>Rumbald</hi> declar'd his Fears of <hi>Keeling</hi>'s Treachery, and that were he sure of it, he would instantly get him knock'd on the Head. But <hi>Keeling</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in amongst them somewhat cleer'd himself, and allay'd their Jealousie, by many asseverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his fidelity to the common Cause.</p>
            <p>Soon after they met again, when it was sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, that <hi>Keeling</hi> had been seen about <hi>Whitehal</hi> and on the Road to <hi>Windsor</hi> where his Majesty then resided: But <hi>Keeling</hi> still frequenting their Company, renew'd the Protestations of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; pretended his going to <hi>Whitehal</hi> was upon other business; complain'd he was in great want of Mony; upon which one Hundred Pounds, the Sum he told them he stood in need of, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently rais'd and lent him that Evening, lest his Want should be a Temptation to him.</p>
            <p>But their distrust increasing every Hour, it was mention'd to <hi>Keeling,</hi> that the best way for him to render himself unsuspected, would be to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw out of Town for some short time, <hi>Rumbald</hi> offering him his House to retire to. <hi>Keeling</hi> still
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44330:38"/>
endeavour'd by many imprecations to quiet their Suspicions of him; but persisted that he could not go into the Country, by reason of urgent bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of his Calling and Family.</p>
            <p>So for that time he got safe out of their Hands, which they afterwards extreamly regretted; some of them owning that it was their purpose, if they could have got him abroad, to have kill'd and privately Buried him.</p>
            <p>But shortly after this, they heard that War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants were out against divers of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agreed to meet on <hi>Monday June</hi> 18th, at <hi>Walcot</hi>'s Lodgings in <hi>Goodman's-Fields,</hi> to consult once for all what should be done for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon safety.</p>
            <p>Accordingly at that time there met <hi>Walcot, Norton, Wade, Romzey,</hi> the two <hi>Goodenoughs, Nelthrop, West, Ferguson.</hi> Their Opinions were very different what course was to be taken. <hi>West</hi> once proposed, that all should stand their ground, and by a bold Denial and their Personal Credit, out-face and baffle <hi>Keelings</hi> single Word. But the consciousness of their own Guilt would not let them harken to that advice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wade</hi> and some others offer'd, as <hi>Armstrong</hi> had done to some of them just before, That things should still be put to a Push, that if a Thousand Men could be got together and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in the Head of them, something might still be done: At the worst it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to Dye like Men, than to be hang'd like Dogs. But that was also rejected as a wild and desperate course. <hi>Romzey</hi> and the rest alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Peoples Hearts were down, and accusing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44330:38"/>
their great Men for want of Spirit and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
            <p>Then they determin'd upon flying; and had some thoughts of hiring a Vessel immediately to transport them into <hi>Holland:</hi> But finding, on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that the Boat could not be clear'd at the <hi>Custom-House</hi> till next Morning, nor at <hi>Gravesend</hi> till the Afternoon, they concluded that would be too late; and therefore every Man was left to shift for himself.</p>
            <p>So they separated in much Terrour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. Only <hi>Walcot,</hi> according to the constant sacrilegious way of the whole Party, to intitle the Almighty to their greatest Impieties, said at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God would yet deliver the Nation, though he did not approve of the present Instruments.</hi> And <hi>Ferguson,</hi> to keep up the same Character of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morseless Villany to the last, took his leave of them in these very words, <hi>That he perceived they were Strangers to this kind of Exercise, but he had been used to fly, and would never be out of a Plot as long as he liv'd; and that he hoped yet to meet some of them at</hi> Dunbar <hi>before</hi> Michaelmas.</p>
            <p>Now a day or two before this their final sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the King and his Council began to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the truth of <hi>Keeling</hi>'s Evidence, by a full knowledge of the Witnesses Character, and by the firmness and consistency of his Testimony; besides many other concurring Circumstances. VVherefore his Majesty order'd VVarrants should be issued out against the Persons accus'd, whereof some absconded, others were taken. Of these last, divers confirm'd what <hi>Keeling</hi> had sworn, and named others as Partakers in the Treason.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44330:39"/>
Whereupon more and more appearing every day to have been engaged, Proclamations were Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> for their speedy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension. By this means, through the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, so many of them were either seiz'd, or deliver'd themselves up, as have irrefragably confirm'd every part of the foregoing Account. What became of the several Conspirators, will appear by the following List.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>James Steuart,</hi> Brother to the Laird of <hi>Cultness,</hi> had fled out of <hi>Scotland</hi> a short time after the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> upon occasion of dangerous Papers taken in his keeping.

               <p>Commissary <hi>Monroe</hi> and the two <hi>Campbells</hi> of <hi>Cessnock</hi> were taken.</p>

               <p>By the positive Confession of these three Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, together with that of Major <hi>Holms,</hi> who were the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s chief Agents in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, was the first greatest light given of the said Earls part in the Conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Of these, <hi>Alexander Gourdon</hi> Laird of <hi>Earlston</hi> was a Zealous Field-Conventicler, and had been a <hi>Bothwel-Bridge-</hi>Rebel: Where upon the rout of their Army, his Father was kill'd, and he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Prisoner. Having afterwards got his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he became Sollicitor for the Faction, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> under pretence of collecting Contributions for maintaining such of them as were denounc'd Fugitives; for which purpose he had a formal Commission sign'd and seal'd in the Name of the General Assembly of their Party at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before any Discovery, he was taken at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle</hi> under a feigned Name, endeavouring to get a passage beyond the Seas. About him were seiz'd divers Original Papers, which as soon as he was made Prisoner, he try'd to make privately away, but the Kings Officers observing his design, secur'd them.</p>
               <p>Amongst these Papers, there was one very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Letter Written to him under another Counterfeit Name of <hi>Pringle.</hi> The composer of it was <hi>John Nisbet,</hi> one of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Agents in <hi>London.</hi> It was dated <hi>March</hi> the 20th of that Year, when the Conspiracy was in the heigth. It gives a perfect account of their Condition at
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44330:41"/>
that time during the Transactions between the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish and Scottish Traytors: Whilst they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hoped the Treaty would take effect; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fear'd it would break off without coming to any Resolution.</p>
               <p>Amongst many other mysterious intimations of Treason, <hi>Nisbet</hi> tells him, <hi>That Trading being very low here, and many breaking daily, desperate Diseases must have desperate Cures: That while they had some Stock left, it would be better to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out, than to keep Shop till all be gone; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this they should not be able to act, but must let all go: That he had been shew'd a Model of Affairs, in such order as he saw; venture they must, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they would: That now they knew what Goods had been most prejudicial to the Trade: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the future, resolv'd to insist only on Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; this being the best way to still some Criticks of the Trade: That they would first endeavour to dispatch the Old Stuff: That some Stock was to be got, to set the broken Merchants up again: That if all holds that is intended, it is almost time to set forward, if they had but their Factors and Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries home, who are gone forth to try how Countries will like their Goods: That they will return within a Week: Then matters will</hi> in instanti <hi>off or on, Break, or go through: That if any strange thing should fall out in the mean time, he would post it to him: That things were full as High as he had Written.</hi>

               <p>These are some amongst divers others of the Covert Significations of the Conspiracy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in <hi>Nisbet</hi>'s Letter; which being taken about <hi>Gourdon,</hi> and sent with him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> after

divers Examinations before the Council there, he plainly detected what was the true sense hidden under the Mystical Style of every Expression in the whole Letter.</p>
               <p>Particularly, That by <hi>the Merchants here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing low, and often breaking,</hi> was meant the Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Dissenters by Excommunications, or other legal ways: That therefore they had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon a desperate Cure, which was rising in Arms: That <hi>the Model of Affairs which would make them venture,</hi> was the Method then going on in order to a Rising: That <hi>by only insisting on Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,</hi> was intended the Conspirators agreeing what they should pull down, which was the whole Government, but not determining positively at first what they should set up: That <hi>by Criticks in the Trade,</hi> were design'd the old Scotch Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who had so often rebell'd: That <hi>Excluding the old Rotten Stuff,</hi> was the Destruction of the entire Frame of the antient Constitution Civil and Ecclesiastical: That <hi>the Broken Merchants to be set up,</hi> were the baffled Scotch-Whigs to be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited again with new assistance: That <hi>their being here at a point to set forward,</hi> was the English Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators being ready for a Rendezvous: That <hi>the Factors and Emissaries,</hi> were People sent forth through <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to try Mens Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations towards a general Insurrection: That by saying, <hi>That upon those Factors return, Matters would be soon on or off,</hi> was intended, that when their Agents were come back to give an account of their success, accordingly the Design would be either deferr'd longer, or they should instantly rise: That <hi>the strange thing</hi> mention'd, was a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44330:42"/>
speedy Insurrection: That <hi>by things being full as high as he had written,</hi> was imply'd the Rebellion was almost ripe, and ready to break forth.</p>
               <p>This is the substance of the Interpretation of the <hi>Letter of Trade</hi> that <hi>Gourdon</hi> of <hi>Earlston</hi> gave in upon Oath at several Examinations. He more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over confess'd, That upon receipt of this Letter he presently came into <hi>England,</hi> where he had frequent Conferences with <hi>Nisbet</hi> touching the Contents of every Clause in it, who always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it in this sense: That by him and divers others he was made fully acquainted with the Treaty then going on in <hi>London,</hi> and with the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Correspondence with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons treating for a speedy Rebellion in both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Another Scotch-Man whose clear and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Testimony has put this Confederacy between the English and Scotch Traytors out of all Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, is <hi>William Carstares,</hi> who had been a Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Fierce Preacher to the Sectaries of both Kingdoms: And was formerly Prisoner in <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh-Castle,</hi> being accus'd for Publishing a Treasonable Pamphlet call'd the Grievances of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time he was much employ'd in many Messages relating to this Conspiracy: Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with Major <hi>Holms</hi> in dispersing the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Libellous Books, and carrying to and fro his Letters in which <hi>Carstares</hi> pass'd under the Name of <hi>Read.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was apprehended at <hi>Tenterden</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> seeking an opportunity of flying beyond Sea. He was taken under the Name of <hi>William Swan,</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:44330:43"/>
then declar'd his true Name was <hi>Moor,</hi> but at last own'd it was <hi>Carstares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Carstares</hi> being brought before the King, and refusing to confess any more than some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hints; alledging, <hi>That it was no place for him to answer in a Criminal Matter;</hi> upon that he was sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where being Examined before the Lords of the Secret Committee, <hi>September</hi> 8th 1684, he confess'd and afterwards renew'd and confirm'd the same Confession <hi>November</hi> 18th, and <hi>December</hi> 22th of the same Year.</p>
               <p>His Deposition having been already made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, it will be enough only to note some special Heads of what he deposed. He confess'd, <q>That <hi>James Steuart,</hi> Brother to the Laird of <hi>Cultness,</hi> wrote to him out of <hi>Holland</hi> in <hi>November</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1682, the Letter importing, that if a considerable Sum of Money could be procur'd from <hi>England,</hi> something of Importance might be done in <hi>Scotland:</hi> That this Letter he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to <hi>Shepard,</hi> and he to Colonel <hi>Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Danvers</hi> being present: That <hi>Shepard</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd answer, Mr. <hi>Sydney</hi> was averse from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> suspecting him to be too much inclin'd to the Royal Family, and the present Government: That the said <hi>Carstares</hi> still urg'd one might be sent to the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle:</hi> That not being able to obtain this, for the foresaid reason, he himself went into <hi>Holland,</hi> was introduced to the Earl, and there discours'd with him particularly about remitting the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to him from <hi>England,</hi> and raising 1000 Horse and Dragoons, and surprizing <hi>Edenburgh-Castle.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:44330:43"/>
                  <q>That the Earls answer was, The Castles would fall to them of course, after that the Work was done abroad: That without a Thousand Horse and Dragoons rais'd in <hi>England</hi> to be ready to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them, nothing could be done: That if such a Number could be rais'd, he would come into <hi>Scotland</hi> with them; whereby he guess'd he might get that Country without trouble, having such a standing Body for their Friends to Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous to.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the said Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> recommended the Deponent to Major <hi>Holms:</hi> That <hi>James Steuart</hi> contriv'd a way of Correspondence by Cyphers and false Names, and sent them over to <hi>Holms,</hi> and the Deponent for their use; and still desir'd him to press for the 30000 <hi>l.</hi> and did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any less Sum, the said Earl saying he had particularly calculated the Expence for Arms and Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though <hi>Steuart</hi> added, If something less could be had, the Earl would content himself.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That when the Deponent was ready to ship for <hi>England, Steuart</hi> writ him word there was hope of the Mony: That the Day after he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here he acquainted Sir <hi>John Cockran</hi> with the said Earls demands of the Sum of Mony, and the Horse and Dragoons: That Sir <hi>John Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> carried him to the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> to whom the Deponent propos'd the Affair; but being a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had no answer from him at that time: That afterwards having met the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> at <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard</hi>'s House, where <hi>Shepard</hi> told him the said Lord was come to speak with him about the Mony, the Deponent reiterated to the Lord
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44330:44"/>
                     <hi>Russel</hi> the former proposition for 30000 <hi>l.</hi> and the 1000 Horse and Dragoons; the said Lord answering, They could not get such a Sum rais'd at the time; but if they had 10000 <hi>l.</hi> to begin with, that would draw People in, and when they were once in, they would soon be brought to more; but as for the Horse and Dragoons, he could say nothing at present, for that behoved to be concerted on the Borders.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Deponent made the same proposal to <hi>Ferguson,</hi> who was much concerned and Zealous in promoting it; and told him, he was doing what he could to get it effected; always blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Colonel <hi>Sydney,</hi> for driving on designs of his own.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the said Deponent met twice, or thrice with <hi>Melvil, Cockran, Jerviswood, Monroe,</hi> the two <hi>Cambells</hi> of <hi>Cessnock, Mongomery</hi> of <hi>Langshaw</hi> and <hi>Veatch,</hi> where they discours'd of Mony to be sent to <hi>Argyle:</hi> That <hi>Monroe, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> and the <hi>Cessnocks</hi> were against medling with the English Conspirators, as Men that would talk, but would not do: That therefore it were better for the Scots to attempt something by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: That <hi>Veatch, Jerviswood,</hi> and this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent were for accepting the Mony.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That at one of their Meetings it was agreed, one <hi>Martin,</hi> late Clerk of the Justice Court, should be sent into <hi>Scotland</hi> to hinder the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from rising, till they saw how Matters went in <hi>England:</hi> That the said <hi>Martin</hi> did go at the Charge of the Gentlemen there met, and was <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

                     </hi> who sent back word, It would not be so
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44330:44"/>
easie a matter to get the Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> to concur; yet that afterwards <hi>Polwart</hi> writ to <hi>Monroe, That the Country was readier than they imagined.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the said Deponent had the Key of the Cypher agreed on in his keeping, when a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came from <hi>Argyle</hi> to Major <hi>Holmes,</hi> intimating that the said Earl would joyn with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> follow his Measures, and obey his Directions: That for the Decyphering of this, he gave the Key to <hi>Veatch,</hi> who was to deliver the Letter to <hi>Ferguson,</hi> and he to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To all this <hi>Carstares</hi> added in his Deposition of <hi>Sept.</hi> 18. 1684. <hi>That he himself had communicated the Design on foot to three famous English Conventicle-Preachers,</hi> Griffith, Mede, <hi>and Dr.</hi> Owen, <hi>who,</hi> he affirm'd, <hi>did all concur in promoting it, and were desirous it should take effect;</hi> which part of <hi>Carstares</hi>'s Oath is the more remarkable, because the King solemnly affirms, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> in his Confession to his Majesty and his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, did particularly name those very three Men, as conscious of the Plot, and withal declar'd in these very words, <hi>That all the considerable Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist Ministers knew of the Conspiracy.</hi> An instance that alone, if there were not many more such, were a sufficient Instruction to all Separatists, of what tender Consciences the Men are, whom they chuse for the principal Guides of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences: Since after all this, <hi>Mede</hi> deposed before his Majesty, <hi>That he never heard of any Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance intended against the Government; but that on the contrary he himself had once advised</hi> Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44330:45"/>
                  <hi>upon discourse of some Libel of his then newly made publick, That it was not their part to do such things.</hi> Nay, their great Oracle Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examin'd upon Oath before the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Jones,</hi> and being ask'd, <hi>Whether he had not heard of a horrid Plot against the Life of the King?</hi> did, not long before his Death, take God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and subscrib'd to it with his dying Hand, <hi>That indeed he had heard of such a Plot by the means of the Kings Proclamation, but no otherwise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which still farther undeniably confirms the Scotch part of the Conspiracy with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, was the Confession of <hi>William Spence</hi> a Scotch-Man, and of Major <hi>Holmes</hi> an English-Man, the former being a Menial Servant to the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle,</hi> the other his long Dependent and Friend; a Man active in the times of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways disaffected to his Majesties Government.</p>
               <p>Major <hi>Holmes</hi> being taken in <hi>London</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Discovery with several of the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Original Letters about him, and being examin'd, confess'd <hi>He knew of the Earl of</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle'<hi>s proposing to some principal Men in</hi> England, <hi>That for</hi> 30000 <hi>Pounds he might be furnish'd for his Expedition into</hi> Scotland: <hi>That the English at last condescended to send him</hi> 10000 <hi>Pounds: That though he had not personally converst with the Great Men who were to raise the Money, yet he had often heard the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>the Lord</hi> Gray, <hi>the Lord</hi> Russel <hi>named: That he himself was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Earl of</hi> Argyle <hi>to convey Letters to and from his Countess and others his Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: That he could not Decypher those taken about him, but that</hi> William Spence <hi>could: That this</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:44330:45"/>
Spence <hi>went under the Name of</hi> Butler, <hi>and was just then come over in the Packet-Boat from</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>to dispose of the Libel call'd</hi> The Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Case.</p>
               <p>This Deposition was given by Major <hi>Holmes</hi> on <hi>June</hi> 29. 1683. the very day that <hi>Spence</hi> being arrived from <hi>Holland,</hi> was apprehended under the Name of <hi>Butler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides this Evidence of <hi>Holmes</hi> concerning <hi>Spence,</hi> it appears plainly by the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s own words in several passages of his Letters, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>Holmes</hi>'s possession, especially in that part of the long Letter of the 21 of <hi>June,</hi> which was not written in Cypher, <hi>That the said</hi> Spence, alias <hi>B.</hi> as he afterwards own'd himself for the Man, <hi>knew his the said Earls Address, and how to write to him;</hi> adding, <hi>That he could instruct</hi> Holmes <hi>in this Cypher, else he had lost six hours Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore upon this assurance that <hi>Spence</hi> could Decypher the Letters, he was examined before the King; but not confessing any thing material, and seeming resolv'd not to do it, he was sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he was brought to discover the whole Intrigue; acknowledg'd <hi>That he himself was the</hi> B. <hi>or</hi> Butler <hi>mention'd in the Letters: That those superscrib'd to</hi> West <hi>and</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Thomson <hi>were directed to Major</hi> Holmes <hi>under those false Names: That he the said</hi> Spence <hi>could open the Letters, and explain the way of reading them;</hi> which he did, and then justified upon Oath the Explanation he had made to be according to their true sense.</p>
               <p>It happen'd also at the same time, whilst <hi>Spence</hi> was under close Examination, that Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44330:46"/>
                  <hi>Crechie,</hi> a Scotch Gentleman skill'd in the Art of Cyphers, did, without any the least Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with <hi>Spence,</hi> Decypher some of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of the said Earls Letters; and when both <hi>Spence</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Gray</hi>'s Copies were found to agree exactly, there could not possibly have been given a more certain Demonstration of the Truth of <hi>Spence</hi>'s way of Decyphering, which he confess'd he was taught by <hi>Argyle</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>In this manner were these Letters proved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick, and the right meaning of them unfolded. And it is evident by the plain Tenour of them, that some of them were written by the said Earl just about the time that the Conspiracy was near ripening, and when he was inform'd of Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pounds only order'd to be sent him: Others were written after he had heard that the Plot was discover'd.</p>
               <p>In every one of those Papers it is easie to trace out manifest Footsteps of the whole Conspiracy. But particularly that of <hi>June</hi> 21st <hi>New Style,</hi> which is <hi>June</hi> 11th of the English, written the very day before <hi>Keeling</hi> made the first discovery, contains not only a vehement expostulation of the said Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s touching the delay of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>England,</hi> and the smallness of the Sum design'd; but a plain Narration how the Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was to be concerted in both Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>The Body of the Letter was written in Cypher, the Preface and Postscript in plain Hand; in both there is reference made to <hi>Butler</hi>'s, that is <hi>Spence</hi>'s, being able to expound it; and from the very same <hi>Spence</hi> was taken the Exposition of it upon Oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:44330:46"/>
Therein the said Earl tells his Correspondent in <hi>England, That he knew not the Grounds their Friends had gone upon to offer so little Money, nor did he understand what Assistance they would give: That till he knew both, and heard what</hi> Carstares, <hi>or any other they should send over, had to say; he purpos'd neither to refuse his service, nor object against any thing resolv'd here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>However that the said <hi>Earl</hi> had truly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in his Proposition formerly made the very least Sum he thought could do the business effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; which was not half of what had been requisite in another Juncture of Affairs: That what Money he propos'd to be raiz'd, was so much within the power of the Persons concern'd, that if a little less could do the business, he had thought it would not be stood upon: That the said <hi>Earl</hi> reckon'd the Assistance of the Horse absolutely necessary for the first Brush: That as to the precise Number nam'd, he would not be peremptory, but he believ'd there would need that effectual Number: That 1000 might be as easily rais'd as 5 or 600; and it were hard if it stuck at the Odds.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That they should consider, whether all ought to be hazarded upon so small a difference as to the Mony: That though 'tis true, what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded is more by half than is requisite for the first Weeks Work, yet soon after, all or more will be necessary; and then Arms cannot be sent like Mony by Bills.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That there are above 1200 Horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and 2000 Foot at least in <hi>Scotland;</hi> all well appointed and tolerably well commanded:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44330:47"/>
That it were hard to expect Country-People on Foot without Horse should beat them triple their Number: That if Multitudes could be got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they would still need more Arms and more Provisions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That if some considerable thing be not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly done at the first appearing, it may fright a little, but will do no good.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the standing Forces will take up some station; probably at <hi>Stirling:</hi> That they will have for aid not only the Militia of Twenty Thousand Foot, and 2000 Horse, but all the Heritors, to the Number it may be of 50000 Men: That though many should be unwilling to fight for the standing Forces, yet most will once join, and many will be as concern'd for them, as any can be against them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That though the said Earl's party should have at first all the success imaginable, yet it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible but some will keep together, and have assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from all the three Kingdoms; then it will not be time to call for more Arms, far less for more Mony to buy them; and they should then prove like the Foolish Virgins.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That it is next to be consider'd how the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented English Lords could employ so much Mony, and so many Horse, better for their own Interest, though the Protestant Cause were not concern'd; this being a little Sum, and small Fonds to raise so many Men, and by Gods Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to repress the whole Power of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Horse to be sent from <hi>England</hi> need stay but a little while to do a job, unless future events should make <hi>Scotland</hi> the Seat of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44330:47"/>
War; which would be yet more to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That by the best Husbanding the total of the Mony proposed, it cannot purchase Arms and absolute Necessaries for one time, for an Army of the Number they were to deal with: That nothing out of the whole is design'd to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd on many things useful, and some necessary, as Tents, Waggons, Cloaths, Shooes, Horse, Horseshooes, &amp;c. All which are not only once to be had, but daily recruited, much less was any of it apportion'd to provide for Meat or Drink, Intelligence, or other incident Charges.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That some honest well-meaning good People may undertake for little, because they can do little, and know little what is to be done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the said Earl had made the reckoning as low as if he had been to pay it all out of his own Purse: That he was resolv'd never to touch the Mony; only to have it issued out according to Order: That he freely submits to any knowing Souldier for the Lists, and to any skilful Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant for the prices he had calculated.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That it will be a great incouragement for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Estates and consideration to venture, when they shall know there is a project and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the whole Affair, and Necessaries provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for such an attempt.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>That before it be given over, he wishes he might have such a conference as he had mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44330:48"/>
in another Letter a week before: wherein he had offer'd either to come over privately in Person, or to meet any to be sent from hence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That he expected not all the Horse from the discontented Lords, but some considerable part might be rais'd by particular Friends.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That he had yet more to add, to inforce all he had said, but it could not be express'd at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: That something more was to be done to prevent the Designs of the Enemies, which he dares not now mention, lest it should put them on their Guard: That he has a considerable Direction in his Head, but all is in Gods Hands.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is a faithful and impartial Abstract of the Mystical Letter; than which, how could there have been express'd by words a more compleat Deduction of the said <hi>Earl</hi>'s part in the design'd Insurrection?</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Cyphers, this follows in words at large, <hi>The Total Sum is</hi> 128 <hi>Guilders, and</hi> 8 <hi>Stivers, that will be paid you by Mr.</hi> B.</p>
               <p>Which last Clause was the Rule whereby Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> found out, and <hi>Spence</hi> discover'd the Decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phering of the whole Letter; and it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done by each of them apart, by making eight Columns, and placing 128 words in each Column descending, as upon view of the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Printed Copies will appear to any Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Contradiction.</p>
               <p>In short, this Letter of the late <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s was known by many of the Privy Council there to be his Hand; and his own Lady upon Oath deposed, <hi>She knew it to be his, though she did not know the Contents of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:44330:48"/>
And such is the Account that is to be given of the said Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Loyalty, which he had desir'd might be the only Standard in what sense he would take the <hi>Test.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto he had been by Inheritance Lord High Admiral and Justice General of <hi>Argyle, Tarbat,</hi> and the Isles, and great Master of the Houshold. He was by his Majesty put into Places of great Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Trust; he was made extraordinary Lord of the Session, one of his Majesties Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. And after his Fathers Condemnation for the highest Crimes, and his own Forfeiture of his Honour and Estate for Treasonable Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a Letter of his, he was restor'd to all his Father possess'd, except the Title of Marquiss. But notwithstanding all these, and many more Obligations of the like nature which he had to his Majesty, his fondness of esteem with the Factious People, his aversion to Monarchy, and hatred of the Royal Family, particularly of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> led him to this height of Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>This, and divers other Letters of the like trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous importance, all written with <hi>Argyle</hi>'s own Hand, being at one and the same time taken about Major <hi>Holmes,</hi> the Person chiefly intrusted by the said Earl to receive and convey all his Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> it cannot be doubted but very many more Papers of the same dangerous Tenor had been this way interchang'd between him and the English and Scotch Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, during the whole progress of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. Especially considering, that in some of these, the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> refers to some Expressions and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44330:49"/>
Propositions which he says he had made in others; and there are no such Expressions to be met with in all these Letters that are taken: Besides that with the Letters themselves there were also seiz'd about <hi>Holmes</hi> several Alphabets, and a Key of Words; whereas of one of the Alphabets there has been as yet no use found in Decyphering; and though in the Key there are Eighty new-coyn'd Words, yet not above Six of them are made use of in all the parcel of the said <hi>Earl</hi>'s Letters hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto intercepted.</p>
               <p>However by the Light these Letters gave, so well agreeing with several other Intelligences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from many Hands, his Majesties Council of <hi>Scotland</hi> were abundantly convinc'd that the the Bloody Design had reach'd thither also; and therefore immediately order'd the bottom of the Business to be search'd into by a Secret Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee. Whereupon Warrants were issued out there to apprehend <hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> Brother-in-Law to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Sir <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> Laird of <hi>Polwart, Pringle</hi> Laird of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woodlie, James Murray</hi> Laird of <hi>Philiphaugh,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Scot</hi> Laird of <hi>Gallowshiels;</hi> all of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Persons named by <hi>Carstares</hi> and others as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with <hi>Argyle</hi> in this Treason, as they had been formerly most active with him, in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to disturb the Loyal Proceedings of the Parliament for enacting the <hi>Test.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of these the Laird of <hi>Polwart</hi> and <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> having been the most busie, and so conscious of their greater guilt, conceal'd themselves, and have hitherto escaped; the other three were taken, and brought to <hi>Edenburg,</hi> where they freely confess'd
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44330:49"/>
upon Oath: As did also Commissary <hi>Monroe,</hi> who had been sent thither Prisoner out of <hi>England.</hi> All which Depositions and Confessions they again repeated and confirm'd in the same solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the Tryal of Mr. <hi>William Baillie</hi> of <hi>Jervis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> without either craving, or receiving any security for himself, did ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously confess,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That about the time, when Sir <hi>John Cockran,</hi> and Commissary <hi>Monroe</hi> got their Commission from the <hi>Carolina</hi> Company for <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> desir'd him to speak to <hi>Monroe,</hi> that he might be added to the Commission: Telling him that he was resolved to go to <hi>London</hi> however upon his own charges: For that his, and their going about the <hi>Carolina</hi> business was only a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and a Blind; but the true design was to push forward the People of <hi>England,</hi> who did nothing but talk, to go more effectually about their business.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That thereupon the said <hi>Baillie</hi> did settle a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with the Deponent, whereby the one was to give an account what past between the Country party in <hi>England,</hi> and the Scotch Men there; the other to write back what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the said <hi>Baillie</hi> told him, the only way to secure the Protestant Religion, was for the King to suffer the Parliament to sit, and pass the Bill of Exclusion: Which the King might be induc'd to do, if the Parliament would take sharp and brisk Measures with him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:44330:50"/>
                  <q>That after the said <hi>Baillie</hi> went to <hi>London,</hi> he did give the Deponent account by Letters, how things were in great disorder there; but he hoped effectual courses were taking to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That Mr. <hi>Robert Martin</hi> did come to Mr. <hi>Pringles</hi> of <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1683, and brought the Deponent a Letter from the said <hi>Baillie</hi> then at <hi>London.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That <hi>Martin</hi> told the Deponent, things in <hi>England</hi> were in great disorder, and like to come to a height, but the Country Party were considering of Methods for securing the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Scotch-Men at <hi>London</hi> had ask'd 30000 Pounds, but that <hi>Argyle</hi> was to have 10000 <hi>l.</hi> which Sum was to be sent by <hi>Baillie</hi> into <hi>Holland</hi> to buy Arms, and then <hi>Argyle</hi> was to Land with those Arms in the <hi>West-Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> deposed farther, That <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaugh</hi> and he went to <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> House, where they met with <hi>Polwart</hi> and <hi>Gallowshiels.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That there it was discours'd among them, that in case the English should rise in Arms, it was necessary so many as could be got on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, should be in readiness to deal with Strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Seize on Horses, and thereafter joyn with those that were in Arms on the Borders of <hi>England:</hi> That then it would be convenient to surprize <hi>Berwick, Stirling,</hi> and some other strong places: That some Persons should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to inquire what Arms were in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: That it was resolv'd every one should
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44330:50"/>
speak to, and prepare such particular Persons as they could trust, not at first in plain terms, but indirectly, and upon supposition of a Rising in <hi>England:</hi> That there was a Word and Sign to be used among them, the sign was by loosing a Button on the Breast, the word was <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That it was agreed among them all, that the best time for <hi>Argyle</hi> to Land, was when there should be a Stir in <hi>England.

               </p>
               <p>In the like manner Commissary <hi>Alexander Monroe</hi> depos'd upon Oath,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> did propose to him, that Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> might be made one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for the Affair of <hi>Carolina.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That he did go along with Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and heard him by the way regretting the hazard, their Laws, Liberties, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion were in.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> spoke to the Deponent more than once at <hi>London</hi> for getting Money from the English to be sent to <hi>Argyle,</hi> to bring home Arms for the said <hi>Argyle</hi>'s use to raise an Insurrection in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That in <hi>Baillie</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>London, William Veitch</hi> a Forefault, that is, a declared Traytor, being present, Sir <hi>John Cockran</hi> did expresly speak of Money to be sent to <hi>Argyle</hi> for the foresaid purpose.</q>

               <p>

                  <q>That on another occasion he heard some of them say, there would be 20000 Men in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ready to assist the Rebellion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That Mr. <hi>Robert Martin</hi> was sent down from that Meeting in <hi>Baillie</hi>'s Chamber to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to try what the Scots would do for their own Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: That it was agreed the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> should rise, when there was a rising in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Commission was granted to <hi>Martin</hi> by all the Persons present, who were the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cockran,</hi> the <hi>Cessnocks</hi> Elder and Younger, Mr. <hi>William Carstares,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Veitch, Jerviswood,</hi> and the Deponent, who did all contribute Money towards his Journey.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That <hi>Martin</hi> at his return from <hi>Scotland</hi> meeting with the Deponent, told him, Matters were in such a Condition there, as a little would kindle the Fire in order to a Rebellion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then also <hi>James Murray</hi> Laird of <hi>Philiphaugh</hi> confess'd, and deposed upon Oath,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That in <hi>May</hi> 1683. upon a Letter from Mr. <hi>Pringle</hi> of <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> to invite him to his House, he came, where he found Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> lately come from <hi>London.</hi>

                  <q>That upon discourse <hi>Martin</hi> told them the City was much irritated through some Attempts upon their Privileges; but that all honest Men were of good heart, and very brisk.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> then told the Deponent he expected the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> having sent for him, because <hi>Martin</hi> had a Letter directed to him from <hi>Jerviswood: Torwoodlie</hi> adding, That there were great Matters in Agitation at <hi>London,</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:44330:51"/>
that <hi>Martin</hi> was come down with a Commission to their Friends here; but he was to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his Instructions only to <hi>Polwart</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who were to pitch on such Persons as they thought fit to intrust with the Affair: That he had great confidence in the Deponent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had sent to acquaint him, that things were now come to a Crisis: That he had reason to think <hi>England</hi> would shortly be in Arms: That it was no Project of an inconsiderable Party, but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign through the Kingdom: That many of the finest Men, and of greatest Interest and Credit were engaged in it there, and had agreed for the advancing Money to furnish Arms here: That <hi>Polwart</hi> would be at <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> that Night, and it would be necessary the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> and the Deponent should confer with him fully on the Business.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That about this time the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> came, who retired a little to discourse with <hi>Martin.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That then <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> told the Deponent, that although <hi>Martin</hi> would not Commune with them upon his Commission directly, yet it would be fit they conferr'd, and without taking notice of his Commission, discours'd of things as their own private Notions, abstracted from any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of a present Design.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That accordingly after Dinner they four re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to a Chamber, and after some general talk of the Discontents of both Kingdoms, these Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions following were discours'd of, <hi>Martin</hi> starting all, or most of them.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:44330:52"/>
                  <hi>If the Country Party in</hi> England <hi>should have thoughts of going into Arms, what could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here in such a case?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Would it not be expedient to have a setled Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence between that Party there, and here?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Might it not be so adjusted, that both Kingdoms should draw out in one day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Might not as many be expected in these Shires, and about</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>as would surprize the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and some to joyn with the English on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and seize on</hi> Berwick, <hi>others to attempt</hi> Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Castle?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> Argyle <hi>should at the same time Land in the</hi> West, <hi>and raise that Country, would not these Measures contribute much to the Advancement and Interest of the Party?

And then might it not be expected there would be as many in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as would be able to deal with the Forces here, at least divert them from troubling</hi> England?</p>
               <p>These Queries being propos'd, it was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <q>That as to setling a Correspondence, it was very convenient for those of a Common Interest, but none could be found here fit to manage it that would undertake it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That as to <hi>trysting,</hi> that is to say, rising at the same time, that could not be done without divulging the Design to all Ranks of People, which none would consent to, except those already in despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Circumstances, and they would not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have much Influence.</q>

                  <q>That <hi>Argyle</hi>'s coming was not much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on, by reason of the uncertainty of Sea-Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: That he might himself be suspected of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Designs; that despair might blind his usual prudence, and prompt him to indigested Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods; so it was expected few of the Gentry, but such as were under very hard Circumstances, would embarque with him.

                  <q>That then <hi>Martin</hi> told the Company, if any had a mind for a suit of Armour, he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide as many as pleas'd, of a new Fashion, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light, and of an easie rate, from one who had made a great many lately for honest Men in <hi>London.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That then all the Company except <hi>Martin,</hi> went to <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> House, where they met him and <hi>Polwart.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That after Supper, having given and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mutual assurance that they were free to commune with <hi>Gallowshiels,</hi> and he with them, touching matters of great Secrecy and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they sate close together, <hi>Polwart</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the discourse:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:44330:53"/>
                  <q>And signifying to them, he was credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that the Country Party in <hi>England</hi> would draw into the Fields shortly, and as he heard, before <hi>Lammas:</hi> That <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> seem'd visibly surpriz'd at it, saying he loved better to be walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his own Parks than to be medling in such matters: However assuring them, if there came any troublesome work, he would joyn with them firmly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> also disapproved of doing any thing during the Kings Life; because that might strengthen the Dukes Interest: That therefore he suspected it was a project of the Common-Wealths-Men, with whom he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved few Scotch Gentlemen would joyn; and that he was almost persuaded the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> would not concur in any Rising during the Kings Life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That to all this <hi>Polwart</hi> answer'd, he heard the English had once agreed on that Principle, but it seem'd they found they must either do their business now, or lay aside all hopes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hereafter. For if the Charter of <hi>London</hi> were let fall, they should not only lose all safe Opportunity of digesting Matters, but also a great part of their Strength: Adding that he heard all things were concerted mutually between <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Friends, and the Heads of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth Party; and though <hi>Monmouth</hi> was shy on that account, yet he hoped he would engage, or he would be deserted by that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That then <hi>Polwart</hi> mentioned the former Queries, as overtures agreed on between other
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44330:53"/>
Friends in <hi>London,</hi> and the Principal Men of that Party there.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> and the Deponent repeated their former answers, <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forwardly with them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That <hi>Polwart</hi> replied, he was fully of their Opinion, if things were entire, but refer'd it to be consider'd, whether it were not better to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with some of these Methods, though not so justifiable as could be wish'd, rather than disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the business totally.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That there was another argument urg'd against rising with the English, because it was talk'd there had been a Day appointed in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s time, which did not hold; so they were not to be relied on.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That then it was proposed to be deliberated what Methods were most proper in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Opinion for <hi>Scotland</hi> to follow, in case of of <hi>Englands</hi> Rising first.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That it was said, All that could be expected or desired from <hi>Scotland</hi> was, that upon certain News of <hi>Englands</hi> being in the Field, those of the Southern Shires should presently rise, and as soon as so many could convene, as would be able to deal with stragling Parties, March to joyn the English on the Borders, that then it would be seasonable for <hi>Argyle</hi> to Land in the West; and these Parties on the Borders might divert the Forces, till he had time to put himself into a posture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That it was left to <hi>Polwart</hi> to Commune with others to this purpose.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:44330:54"/>
                  <q>That all the Company seem'd to agree, they should move nothing in the Affair, till they had a certain account what <hi>England</hi> propos'd, and who were to be their Heads; that if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd any thing against the Kings Person, or for overturning Monarchy, they should not be clear to joyn.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That it was recommended to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to be inquiring indirectly about the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their Neighbours, and what Arms were amongst them; that so, if they should resolve to joyn with the English, they might know where to seek Men and Arms sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That here it was said by one, (by <hi>Polwart</hi> as the Deponent thinks) That if the Earl of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Torwoodlie, Gallowshiels,</hi> and he took Horse, most part of <hi>Tiviot-Dale</hi> and <hi>Selkirk-Shire</hi> would soon come to them, especially when they heard that <hi>England</hi> was risen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That they all agreed to meet there again at <hi>Midsummer-</hi>Fair, when the account from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might be expected; but in case it came to any of their hands sooner, each promis'd to advertise the rest.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Deponent farther added, he was told in private by <hi>Polwart</hi> or <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That <hi>Polwart</hi> kept Correspondence with their Friends at <hi>London,</hi> naming the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cockran, Jerviswood,</hi> and Commissary <hi>Monroe.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Money to be advanc'd by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Partie to <hi>Scotland,</hi> was ready when <hi>Martin</hi> left <hi>London.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:44330:54"/>
                  <q>That it was expected within few days after, it would be dispatch'd with some Confident to <hi>Holland;</hi> that it was 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and was to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by that Confident at <hi>Argyle</hi>'s sight, for buying of Arms, and providing Shipping to transport them with <hi>Argyle.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That as soon as the Scots at <hi>London</hi> got Notice of their Confidents arrival in <hi>Holland,</hi> and that all other things were concluded with the English, which might be about the middle of <hi>June,</hi> then they would come down into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and give them a particular Account of all Resolutions taken.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Deponent was told all Letters were written by both Parties, as about the <hi>Carolina</hi> Business, or concerning some Houshold-Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: That there was a Sign and a Word agreed on, that they might know with whom to use freedom; the Word was <hi>Harmony,</hi> and the Sign was the <hi>Opening of Buttons on the Breast-Coat, and shutting them presently.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Deponent never saw it used, except when he visited <hi>Parkhay</hi> in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> about the end of <hi>June;</hi> who asking whether he had the Word and Sign of the <hi>Carolina-</hi>Men, and the Deponent having given them, said, <hi>He was afraid the</hi> Carolina <hi>Business did not go well, for there had been some of the Managers expected there eight days past, but none were come: Nor could he learn any of their Friends had heard from them for several Posts.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The said <hi>James Murray</hi> of <hi>Philiphaugh</hi> deposed farther, <q>That at their Meeting at <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> it was resolv'd they should keep their Cess or Tax
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44330:55"/>
unpaid till their next Meeting at <hi>Midsummer,</hi> and should deal with all those they had influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do the like, and that upon the Supposition mention'd in his former Oath.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next, <hi>Hugh Scot</hi> Laird of <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd and deposed, <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Tarras <hi>and</hi> Philiphaugh <hi>did come to his House in</hi> May 1683. <hi>That</hi> Polwart <hi>came likewise thither, where there were Discourses and Proposals, That if the English did rise in Arms, their Friends in the</hi> South-Shires <hi>should rise with them: That they should seize the Horses belonging to the Kings Troops where they grazed, and attempt the Town of</hi> Berwick, <hi>and the Castle of</hi> Stirling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it was likewise there discour'd of the late Earl of</hi> Argyle'<hi>s coming to invade</hi> Scotland; <hi>but because of the uncertainty of Sea-Voyages, there was not much stress laid upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it was also proposed, such of the</hi> South-Country <hi>whom they trusted should be acquainted with it: That Endeavours should be used to learn what Arms were in the Country: That the Earl of</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Philiphaugh, Torwoodlie, Polwart, <hi>and some others should draw to Horse with the first, when the rising should be in a readiness; and that it might be expected the South parts of</hi> Tiviot-Dale <hi>and</hi> Selkirk-Shire <hi>would joyn with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The said <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> had also deposed before the Lords of the Secret Committee, <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Tarras <hi>and</hi> Philiphaugh <hi>being in his House in</hi> May, <hi>discours'd of an intended Rising in</hi> England <hi>and in</hi> London <hi>in particular, and of Proposals made to the</hi> Scots <hi>to rise with them: That</hi> Polwart <hi>was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44330:55"/>
there present, and told them he was sure the English intended so; That they discours'd it was fit to seize</hi> Berwick <hi>and</hi> Stirling: <hi>It was also talk'd of bringing the Duke of</hi> York <hi>to his Tryal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The said <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> deposed farther before the Lords of the Committee, <hi>That in the Month of</hi> May 1683. <hi>the Earl of</hi> Tarras, Hume <hi>of</hi> Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart <hi>the Elder, and the Laird of</hi> Philiphaugh <hi>came to the Deponents House, where they spake of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Protestant Religion, and of a Party in</hi> England <hi>who would secure or seize the King or Duke: That if any should rise in Arms to defend or rescue them, there was another Party who would rise against them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it was proposed some Country-men should be spoken to, to try their Resolutions: That it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise proposed to seize the Officers of State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it was there said, Sir</hi> John Cockran <hi>was to come to the West from</hi> England <hi>to advance the Design: That the Earl of</hi> Argyle <hi>was to Land in the West</hi> Highlands <hi>to raise that Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That of these Matters all that were present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd, as of an Affair they were agitating, and wherein themselves were particularly concern'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These several plain and full Proofs, together with the Depositions of <hi>Carstares</hi> before mentioned, being also strengthen'd by the Confessions of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Shepard</hi> and <hi>Zechary Bourn,</hi> and all exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Trial of <hi>William Baillie</hi> of <hi>Jerviswood,</hi> were not only over-abundantly sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Person accused of his particular share in the Guilt; but they also remain as so many stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and indubitable testimonies of the truth of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44330:56"/>
the whole Conspiracy between the English, and Scotch Rebels.</p>
               <p>After all this, how is it possible that the most audacious of the Factious Party of both Nations, notwithstanding their being so expert in driving on the Trade of Lying and traducing their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, should ever have any tolerable colour of probability to invalidate or discredit the undoubted Evidence of so many Witnesses, most of them Men of high Quality, great Estates, potent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests; all of them Zealous and indefatigable as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors of the Rebellious Cause; and this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given in by them at first voluntarily, and often again reiterated, and adher'd to, against <hi>Baillie</hi> their Chief Companion in Iniquity, their near Kinsman and Friend?</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Baillie</hi> of <hi>Jerviswood</hi> himself, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who pass'd upon his Assize did with one Voice find the Crimes of Art and part in the Conspiracy, and of concealing and not revealing the same, clearly proved against him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was adjudg'd to suffer the Punishment of a Traytor: His Life and Death being such as might be expected from the Nephew and Son-in-Law of the Old Arch Traytor <hi>Warriston,</hi> in whose Family he was bred up, and tutor'd under his Discipline, according to his Principles.</p>
               <p>Such were the chief Steps the Scotch Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators had made in their part of the Treasonable Design, as far as through the Divine Favour it has been hitherto traced out by the Extraordinary Diligence, Wisdom and Integrity of his Majesties present Ministers in that Kingdom. For the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders clearer comprehending the whole progress of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44330:56"/>
the Villany, the King thought best to have it thus represented in one view, and put all together in an uninterrupted course of Narration: Though by this Method divers things have been already spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, which in the natural course of time hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd after the several material passages, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main yet unmention'd, relating to the English part of the Conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to return to the Year 1683, and to what happen'd in <hi>England</hi> that Summer, short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the first Discovery.; His Majesty having now received irresistible Proof of the certainty of the Wicked and unnatural Design, that the World might have the like conviction, resolv'd speedily to bring some of the most Notorious Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to a fair and open Tryal.</p>
               <p>The first Person who was put upon justifying himself, was Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Thomas Walcot,</hi> on the Twelfth of <hi>July</hi> of that Year. Against him divers Witnesses were produced, who, in their Depositions, first gave some distinct account of the Plot in General, and then of the particular share the Prisoner at the Bar had in it.</p>
               <p>As to what concern'd <hi>Walcot</hi> himself, Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> first deposed, That the said <hi>Walcot</hi> came out of <hi>Holland</hi> with <hi>Ferguson</hi> after <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Death: That he came to <hi>West</hi>'s Chamber where he was present when a List was brought of the Assassines, and agreed to joyn with them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Command a Party to charge the Guards: That he undertook to go and view <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi>'s House, and bought a Horse for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: That he was present at the dividing of <hi>London</hi> into twenty parts in order to an Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44330:57"/>
and at the Consult for buying of Arms after the disappointment at the <hi>Rye:</hi> That he was at the Meeting for carrying on the Conspiracy on <hi>Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> before the Discovery: That after it they met at Captain <hi>Tracies, Walcot</hi>'s own Lodgings, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being present.</p>
               <p>Next <hi>Josiah Keeling</hi> swore that <hi>Walcot</hi> was at the Trayterous Assembly at the Salutation-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, when the Deponent was called <hi>Gulick,</hi> and a Health drunk to the English <hi>Gulick; West</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Gulick</hi> in Dutch was <hi>Keeling</hi> in English; adding, <hi>He hoped to see</hi> Keeling <hi>at the Head of as good an Army at</hi> Wapping, <hi>as it was reported one</hi> Gulick <hi>was then at</hi> Cologne.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Zechary Bourn</hi> witnessed, That <hi>Walcot</hi> used to come to <hi>Ferguson</hi> when he lodg'd at his House: That <hi>Walcot</hi> and several others met at the Dragon on <hi>Snow-Hill,</hi> and often in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in order to raise Men, and divide the City into twenty parts for securing the King and the Duke: That almost every time they met, at least three times, the Prisoner at the Bar was there: That he was at the Meeting at <hi>Tracies,</hi> where they debated of <hi>standing to it with Swords in their Hands, and of killing</hi> Keeling <hi>for having made the Discovery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert West</hi>'s Testimony concerning him went somewhat farther back. He deposed, That he became acquainted with <hi>Walcot</hi> the Summer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he told the Deponent the <hi>Carolina</hi> Business was only a Pretence; That he ask'd the Deponent upon the Election of the Sheriffs, <hi>Will the People do nothing to secure themselves?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon acquainting him with an Insurrection then
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44330:57"/>
design'd within three weeks or a month: That <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was in the Design, and had engaged him also: That he had an Expectation of being Colonel of Horse; asking the said <hi>West, Whether he would have any Command under him?</hi> That up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his refusal, he desired him to lend him a Suit of Silk Armour: That the said <hi>Walcot</hi> told him of several Designs to Attack the King and the Duke: That in the Business of the <hi>Rye,</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to Command the Party that was to set upon the Guards: That after the Disappointment, he met with the other Conspirators, where they discours'd of it, and complain'd they had not Arms in readiness: That he sometimes made one in the Trayterous Discourses at the Deponents, and at the Young-Devil-Tavern: That he was present at the Meeting at <hi>Tracies</hi> relating to their escape; the Prisoner at the Bar himself then say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God would still deliver the Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Letter to Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> was also produced, which he was proved to have own'd before the Council to be his Hand. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it being, That he was come to Town to lay himself at his Majesties Feet: That this was the first Crime he had been Guilty of since the Kings Return, and too soon by much now: That he was ready to discover to his Majesty all that he knew in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which might be something more than the first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer could acquaint him with, especially as to <hi>Ireland:</hi> That his intimacy with a Scotch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, through whose Hands much of the business pass'd, occasioned his knowing very much; and that it was laid very broad, or he was mis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44330:58"/>
concluding with a proposal that he would follow the Traytors who were fled, and give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what Measures they should take; with other the like expressions.</p>
               <p>There was likewise a Paper given in Evidence that was taken about him in <hi>Newgate;</hi> wherein he desir'd <hi>Romzey</hi> and <hi>West</hi> to spare him, saying, <hi>They had ground enough to serve the King upon other Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to his private Confession to the King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his first Examination, that was not produc'd against him, though in that he had told divers new Particulars of the Conspiracy, and named the Men of Quality who had undertaken to raise the several Shires.</p>
               <p>Against all this <hi>Walcot</hi>'s defence only consisted in his own denial of having had any Hand in the Assassination; saying, <q>He knew well enough, if he should have undertaken to charge the Guards whilst others kill'd the King, he was equally Guilty with those that kill'd him; but that he was sick of the Gout during the Meetings whilst the King was at <hi>Newmarket:</hi> Moreover, that those Witnesses were sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dipped themselves, and swore against him to save their own Lives: That <hi>Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Rumbald</hi> he never knew: That the last Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his Lodgings was appointed by <hi>Romzey,</hi> he himself knowing nothing of it: That he came accidentally to the other Meetings only to hear News. He confessed he heard there was a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign amongst divers great Lords and Gentlemen for asserting Liberties and Properties; but that he was not at their Consultations. The Sum
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44330:58"/>
was, that he had heard a great deal of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, but had no hand in it, and therefore his fault could be only Misprision of Treason. And as to his Letter, he alledged he had only heard what he promised to discover from <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guson.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To the most material parts of this Defence, it was answer'd by his Majesties Learned Council at Law, That there is nothing more just than to make use of some Traytors to Convict others, else Treason might be hatch'd most securely: That because the Witnesses had been concern'd in the Plot, therefore they were to be believed; for who should know it but those that were concern'd? That better VVitnesses could not have been had, except the thing had succeeded: That the very being at Treasonable Consults, and keeping them private, is not only Misprision, but High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And as to his having the Gout, <hi>West</hi> told him, he remember'd it very well by a good token, that <hi>Walcot</hi> himself said, <hi>He was afraid when the time came, he should not be able to draw on his Boot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the whole Evidence against <hi>Walcot</hi> being clear and positive Testimony, and what he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for himself being only his own single Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Negation, without any support of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, the Jury immediately brought him in guilty of High Treason. According to which Sentence he was Executed on the 20th of the said Month. At the time of his Execution he again acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd what he had told the King, and writ to the Secretary of State, <q>That the Business was laid very deep; he said, An Act of Indulgence
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44330:59"/>
would do well, because the King had a great many Men to take Judgment of: He persisted, he was to have had no hand in his Majesties Death, though he confess'd it was proposed when he was present: He declared he did not know that this Conspiracy was older than the <hi>August</hi> or <hi>September</hi> before: but so old he own'd it was.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next Offender that came under the Stroak of Justice, was <hi>William Hone</hi> a Joyner, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the Bar, would presently have confess'd himself guilty of great part of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation. But refusing to confess all, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to plead, and the next day was brought on his Tryal. Then again he desir'd he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract his Plea, and offer'd to plead Guilty. But since he would not own the whole Indictment, for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the World the Evidence against him was produc'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Josiah Keeling</hi> swore, That the Prisoner at the Bar was at the Dolphin-Tavern, when several sorts of Arms were agreed on to be provided under the borrow'd Names of <hi>Swan-Quills, Goose-Quills, Crow-Quills:</hi> That after that Meeting, <hi>Hone</hi> told the Deponent, He was to be one of them who were to go down to the <hi>Rye</hi> to Assassinate the King. That he since also told him, It would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be well till the <hi>Black-Bird</hi> and the <hi>Gold-Finch</hi> were knock'd on the Head; explaining those terms to be meant of the King and the Duke. To which Witness <hi>Hone</hi> reply'd in open Court, <hi>That as to the</hi> Black-Bird <hi>he own'd it, but not as to the</hi> Gold-Finch.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>West</hi> deposed, That <hi>Goodenough</hi> having told him he would try <hi>Hone,</hi> whether he would
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44330:59"/>
attempt on the Duke without the King, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent ask'd <hi>Hone,</hi> Whether he had seen <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough?</hi> He answer'd, He had, and that he had spoken to him about a job for the Duke. That at another time also <hi>Hone</hi> ask'd the Deponent, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, shall we do nothing?</hi> Adding, <hi>That if the Duke of</hi> Monmouth <hi>would be true, and appear, he would bring</hi> 50 <hi>or</hi> 60 <hi>Men from the other side of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to help to do the Business.</hi> And that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent demanding what Business? He answer'd, <hi>A brisk Push at the two Brothers.</hi> That being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther question'd, What Brothers? He said, <hi>The Captain and Lieutenant;</hi> which were the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Names they sometimes used for the King and the Duke.</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler</hi> deposed, He had known <hi>Hone</hi> many years, and always knew him guilty of plotting, contriving, and ready for such Enterprises as this: particularly that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed taking off the King and the Duke with Cross-Bows from <hi>Bow-Steeple,</hi> whilst they were standing in a House directly over against it on the Lord Mayors Day: That <hi>Hone</hi> confess'd this very thing when examined before his Majesty: That he had also acquainted divers Persons, that he was to make one to kill the King and the Duke.</p>
               <p>Then Captain <hi>Richardson</hi> swore, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner confess'd to Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler,</hi> in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, that <hi>Goodenough</hi> came to him and told him, he wanted Labourers; That <hi>Hone</hi> asking him for what? <hi>Goodenough</hi> said it was to kill the King, and the Duke: That he did agree to be one of the Number: That <hi>Hone</hi> did say another
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44330:60"/>
time, he was for killing the King, and saving the Duke; but that <hi>Goodenough</hi> was for both: That he told them of the business of the <hi>Rye,</hi> calling it the place where the King was to have been Murder'd.</p>
               <p>To all this <hi>Hone</hi> made no other answer, but that he was drawn in by <hi>Goodenough;</hi> and as for killing the King from <hi>Bow-steeple,</hi> he was told of it by another. So the Jury found him Guilty without going out of the Court.</p>
               <p>At his Execution, he own'd himself Guilty of the Crime, for which he stood condemn'd. Only alledging again, that he was drawn in. He confess'd also, he did say he was for killing the King, and saving the Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On which last expression the Factious party immediately laid hold. And they have since most impudently made use of it, in their Libels both at home and abroad, to take the aspersion of this Conspiracy, off from themselves, insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating that this saying of <hi>Hones</hi> (a Notorious Fanatick) must needs prove him to have been a conceal'd Papist. Whereas it is apparent, he said it upon a quite different account: Since it was a common opinion among them, that if they could but do the Kings business, their work against the Duke would be much easier: A Lesson first taught them by their great Master the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> For when in one of their Trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Cabals, among other Considerations of time and place, for killing the Royal Brothers, that between <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> and <hi>Windsor</hi> was proposed and some excepted against it, because his Majesty and his Royal Highness seldom went that way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44330:60"/>
the said Earl advised them not to stand upon that, and not to omit the opportunity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the King away for any such Objection; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this wicked reason for his advice, <hi>That if the King were once dispatched, they should easily be able to deal with the Duke of</hi> York; grounding his Judgment on a most false Supposition, that the People were generally averse from his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>The next Criminal arraign'd was <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> who was brought to his Tryal <hi>July</hi> the 13<hi>th</hi> of that year.</p>
               <p>Against him Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> deposed, <q>That in the end of <hi>October,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 1683. there met at Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi>'s House in <hi>Abchurch-Lane,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong</hi> and <hi>Ferguson:</hi> That the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> desired him to go to them thither, to know what resolution was taken about the Rising of <hi>Taunton:</hi> That he did go, Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up where they were, and he deliver'd his Message: That the Answer was, <hi>Mr.</hi> Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard <hi>had fail'd them; and there could be no more done in the matter at that time:</hi> That there was at the same time a discourse by all the Company about seeing what posture the Guards were in, that they might know how to surprize them; That some of them undertook to go and see: That my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> in particular did speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Rising, and gave his consent to it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> swore, <q>That in <hi>October</hi> last, <hi>Ferguson</hi> requested of him, in the Duke
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44330:61"/>
of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Name, the conveniency of his House, for some Persons of Quality to meet in; That the same Day in the Evening the Duke of of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> the Lord <hi>Russel, Armstrong</hi> and <hi>Ferguson</hi> came: That they desir'd to be private, and none of his Servants to come up: That their discourse was, How to surprize the Guards: That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Armstrong</hi> went one Night to the <hi>Mues</hi> to view them: That the next time they came, <hi>Armstrong</hi> said, <hi>The Guards were remiss, and the thing was feasible:</hi> That they had two Meetings of this kind at his House; That in one of them something was read by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guson</hi> in the nature of a Declaration, setting forth the Grievances of the Nation in order to a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: That he could not say positively the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was there when it was read; but the said Lord was there, when they talk'd of seizing the Guards.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Escrick</hi> gave his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, consisting of two parts, a general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of what he knew of the whole Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and his particular Evidence touching the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s being engaged in it.</p>
               <p>In the general part, his Testimony was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what has been already cited out of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to his Majesty; only in some passages he was more particular as to Persons, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Walcot,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> as appears by the Printed Tryal.</p>
               <p>But what peculiarly related to the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was to this effect; That after the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44330:61"/>
Flight, the chief Persons concern'd in the Conspiracy in his time, began to consider they had gone so far it would be unsafe for them to make a retreat; and that so great an Affair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of so many Particulars, which were to be manag'd with so much fineness, it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to have some General Council: That therefore they resolv'd to erect a Cabal among themselves, which was made up of six Persons, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Algernoon Sydney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> Junior, and the Deponent: That this was about the middle of the <hi>January</hi> before: That then they met at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s House, where it was presently agreed, their proper Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was to take care of the whole: That the chief things they debated were, Whether the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection should begin first in <hi>London</hi> or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> insisting, it should be first in the Country; then what Countries and Towns were fittest, and most ready for Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then, what Arms were to be got, and how to be disposed; then that it was necessary to have a common Bank of 25 or 30000 <hi>l.</hi> to answer the occasions of such an Undertaking; but that the greatest point was to order it so, as to draw <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into a consent with them; because it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite all diversion should be given to the Kings Forces.</p>
               <p>That about Ten Days after every one of the same persons met again at the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s House: That they then came to a resolution, of sending some Persons to the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle an Understanding with him, and that a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44330:62"/>
should be dispatch'd into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to invite some Scoth-Men hither, who best understood the Estate of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to give an account of it: That the Persons agreed on to be sent for were Sir <hi>John Cockran,</hi> the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> and one of the Name of <hi>Cambel:</hi> That to this purpose it was order'd, a Person should be thought on that was to be sent: That Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi> was intrusted to take care of that business: That the said Colonel told the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, he had sent <hi>Aaron Smith:</hi> That then they agreed not to meet again till the return of the Messenger; who was gone about a Month before they heard any thing of him; though the Letter he carried, could have done no great hurt, had it been taken, because it was Written in a kind of a Cant, under the disguise of a Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Carolina:</hi> That all this Debate at the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s went without contradiction, all there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent giving their consent: That as for raising Money, every one was put to think of such a way, that Money might be collected without Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string Jealousie: That after this the Deponent met no more with them; but when he return'd out of the Country, he was inform'd <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was come back, and that Sir <hi>John Cockran</hi> was also come to Town.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Attherbury</hi> the Kings Messenger depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that the foresaid <hi>Cambel</hi> and his Son were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>London,</hi> making their escape out of a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in a Woodmongers House, four Days after they had been in Town; during which space, they confess'd they had chang'd their Lodgings three Times, and that they and Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> of <hi>Jerviswood</hi> came to Town together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:44330:62"/>
Against this Evidence the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (besides some Objections in point of Law, wherein he was over-ruled by the Opinion of all the Judges there present) was to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the two times they met, was upon no form'd Design, only to talk of News, and of things in general: That the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a voluble Tongue, they delighted to hear him discourse: That he knew of no such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Six chosen, for who should chuse them? That the Witnesses against him swore to save their own Lives, and therefore could not be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible: That <hi>Romzey</hi> was notoriously known to have been highly obliged by the King and the Duke; and it was strange he should be capable of such a Design as to Murder the King; that no Body then could wonder, if to save his own Life, he should endeavour to take away ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: That the time by the 13th of the King was elapsed, since the Prosecution was not made in the six Months: That a Design of Levying War is no Treason, except it appear by some Overt Act: That there was but one Meeting at <hi>Shepard</hi>'s House, nor was he ever there but once: That then he came late, staid not above a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, tasting Sherry with <hi>Shepard;</hi> and that there ought to be two VVitnesses to one and the same thing at the same time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then he produced VVitnesses to prove that the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> before he was taken, declar'd <hi>He believ'd the Lord</hi> Russel <hi>innocent, and knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:44330:63"/>
The rest of his Justification consisted of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of several Persons concerning the Virtue and Sobriety of his former Life.</p>
               <p>As to what concern'd the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>He believed the Lord</hi> Russel <hi>not to be guilty;</hi> it was answer'd by the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> himself, <q>That he confess'd he had said so, being then himself not a cused, so that he intended to out-face the thing both for himself and the Party; but now his Duty to God, the King and his Country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd it, he must say the Truth; and that though the Council of Six were not chosen by any Community, yet they did erect themselves by mutual Agreement one with another into that Society.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The rest was answer'd by the Kings Learned Council at Law, <q>That he was not Try'd upon the 13th of the King, but upon the 25th of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third: That to Raise a Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy within the Kingdom is what is call'd Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying War by that Statute: That to design to seize on the King, or to depose him, or to raise the Subjects against him, hath been setled by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Resolutions of the Judges to be within that Statute, and Evidences of a Design to kill the King: That in Cases of Treason, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary there should be two VVitnesses to the same individual Fact, at the same time; but if there be two VVitnesses of things tending to the same Fact, though at several times, and upon several occasions, it is sufficient: That if there be one Witness of one Act of Treason, another of a second, another of a third, they will be enough to Convict a Man of High Treason:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44330:63"/>
That so it was determin'd by the Opinion of all the Judges in <hi>England,</hi> and by the Lords in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Case.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was farther urged, <q>That the VVitnesses against the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> were not profligate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, nor Men who wanted Faith and Credit before that time; but such against whom there had been no legal Exceptions made by himself: That there was no Contradiction, no Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence or Contrivance at all between them; and that it cannot be imagined such Men should Damn their own Souls to take away the Life of a Gentleman, against whom they had no Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Romzey</hi>'s being much obliged to the King and the Duke, <q>That it was apparent by many Instances, that no such, though the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Obligations, had hinder'd ill Men from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring against his Majesty. For was not the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> were not divers others of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators in like manner obliged, and advanced in Estate and Honour by the King?</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to their coming only to <hi>Shepard</hi>'s to taste VVine, it was said, <q>That could not have been the end of their Meeting: VVhy did they then come so privately? VVhy then did they order none of the Servants to come up? It was plain the Design they met on, requir'd only such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be present as had an Affection for the Cause.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was also urg'd, <q>That it is not a good Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against a Mans being Evidence in High Treason, that he himself was engaged in it; but that such Men are the most proper Persons to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44330:64"/>
be Evidence, none but they being able to detect such Counsels.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for the several Divines, and Men of Honour and Quality produced to testifie the Virtue and Sobriety of the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Conversation; it was answer'd, <q>That an Affectation of Popularity has often proved a Snare strong enough to tempt many Men, who have otherwise been of great Temperance and Virtue. Nor indeed can there be any more dangerous Enemies to a State or Kingdom, than such as come sober to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour its Destruction.</q> VVhich old and true Observation was signally exemplified in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Case of the Lord <hi>Russel:</hi> For <hi>West</hi> depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <q>That the Underacters in the Treason most depended on the said Lord, for this very reason, because they look'd on him as a Man of great Sobriety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole Process he was found guilty of High Treason. But in stead of Drawing, Hanging and Quartering, the usual and legal Penalty of that Crime, the Execution was by his Majesties Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency chang'd into that of Beheading. Though it is well known, this very Prerogative of the <hi>Kings</hi> having it in his Power to alter the Punishment of High Treason, had been vehemently disputed by the Party, and particularly by the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> himself in the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Case.</p>
               <p>The said Lord <hi>Russel</hi> at the time of his Death, which was the 21st of that Month, deliver'd a Paper to the Sheriffs, and left other Copies of it with his Friends, whereby it was immediately dispers'd amongst the People; the general drift of it being to make odious Insinuations against the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44330:64"/>
Government, invidious Reflections on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of his Majesties Justice, and undue Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of his own Fault.</p>
               <p>As to the whole Matter of it, Time, the best Discoverer, and Light of Truth, has since shewn it to be full of Enormous Falshoods: And for the manner of its Composure, it was such, as rather became the Subtilty, Artifice and Equivocation of some crafty hypocritical Confessor, or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Casuist, than the Noble plainness and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of a Gentleman; especially of One who in this very Paper so much boasts of the Sincerity and Candour of his whole Life, and of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual hatred of Tricks and Evasions.</p>
               <p>Among divers other notorious Shifts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varications contain'd in it, this is observable, That in this Paper he declares solemnly he never was at <hi>Shepard</hi>'s in that Company but once, as in his Tryal he had affirm'd absolutely he never was there but once: whereas, besides what <hi>Shepard</hi> posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively swore, <q>That he was more than once there, and in that very Company;</q> the said Lord <hi>Russel</hi> himself also, when he was Examin'd in the <hi>Tower</hi> by his Majesties Command <hi>June</hi> 28th, confess'd <q>He had been at <hi>Shepard</hi>'s House frequently;</q> which Confession after it was written down, read and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by himself, he in great Agitation of Mind desir'd he might alter it. And the Alteration he made was to put in <hi>divers times</hi> in stead of <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently.</hi> The Truth of which appears by the Original thus subscribed, and corrected by the the Lord <hi>Russel;</hi> and by the known Integrity of Sir <hi>Leolyn Jenkins,</hi> Sir <hi>John Ernly,</hi> and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Atturney-General and Sollicitor-General,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44330:65"/>
who receiv'd the Examination, and have attested the Alteration.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Russel</hi> likewise in the Printed Speech affirms, <hi>His intention of going to</hi> Shepards <hi>was to taste Sherry;</hi> and in his Tryal he said, <hi>He staid not above a quarter of an Hour there tasting of Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Though presently after in the very same Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, forgetting what he had said, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <hi>He was desir'd to go thither by the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>upon a business of greater consequence than the tasting of Sherry:</hi> Which was, <hi>That the Duke of</hi> Monmouth <hi>call'd upon him to tell him, that the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>and some other hot Men would undo them all, if great care were not taken; and therefore intreated him to go with him to</hi> She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards. To this he adds, <hi>That when he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there were things spoken by some with much more heat than Judgment;</hi> Things of the same Nature, no doubt, with those he confess'd to have heard before in the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which made the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> himself cry out, <hi>Did you ever hear so Horrid a thing?</hi> However all these Treasonable Discourses about making some <hi>Stirs</hi> as he stiles them, the said Lord would fain have had pass only for Misprision of Treason. Though it is remarkable that in all those his last Words, there is no more sign of his asking Forgiveness of God or the King, for his confess'd Misprision, than for the High Treason. Moreover in the same printed Paper he solemnly avows, <hi>There was no undertaking at</hi> Shepards <hi>for seizing the Guards; none appointed to view or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them; only that there was some discourse then, and at other times, about the feasibleness of it;</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44330:65"/>
                  <hi>That several times by accident he heard it mention'd, as a thing might easily be done.</hi> By which and other the like concessions in that Speech he well nigh grants himself Guilty of the Crime whereof he was accus'd; since the Judges often assur'd him, that those discourses and consultations not reveald are High Treason.</p>
               <p>He farther says, <hi>it was by a strange fetch, that a design of seizing on the Guards was construed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of killing the King.</hi> But that this constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was no such strange fetch, Colonel <hi>Walcot</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self might have inform'd him; who both at his Trial, and his Execution, did with far more Truth and Ingenuity allow, <hi>that it was the same thing for him to engage the Kings Guards, whilst another kill'd him, as to kill him with his own Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though, to put this whole matter out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, touching that Consultation at <hi>Shepards,</hi> for seizing the Guards, his Majesty declares on the Faith of a King, appealing also to the Memory of his Royal Highness to confirm the same, That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did, in express Terms confess this very particular, and all the circumstances of it to his Majesty at the time of his rendring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: Namely, <hi>That the foresaid debate of surpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Guards was at</hi> Shepards; <hi>that the Lord</hi> Russel <hi>was one of the Persons debating it; that the result was, the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>the Lord</hi> Gray <hi>and Sir</hi> Thomas Armstrong <hi>should go view the Guards in order to seize them; that accordingly they three did go, and take a view of them to that end; and that the report they made to the same Company at their next Meeting was, that the thing might be done, if they had any considerable strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:44330:66"/>
But what need any farther Proof of the insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s last Justification, than the foremention'd Deposition of <hi>Carstares?</hi> An Evidence not only by Law unquestionable, but such as cannot but be esteem'd by the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators themselves of invincible strength and conviction: Since he was a Man eminent in their Party, and one of their principal seducing Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And what the said <hi>Carstares</hi> deposed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> his Majesty thinks fit to be repeated here again. It was, <hi>That when he return'd into</hi> England <hi>out of</hi> Holland, <hi>where he had been to concert matters with the Earl of</hi> Argyle, <hi>for promoting the General Conspiracy; the next Day he met with Sir</hi> John Cockran, <hi>and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving acquainted him with the Earl of</hi> Argyle'<hi>s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of</hi> 30000 l. <hi>Sterling, and the Thousand Horse and Dragoons, Sir</hi> John Cockran <hi>carried the said</hi> Carstares <hi>to the Lord</hi> Russel; <hi>to whom he proposed the affair, but being then a perfect stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, had no return from him at that time. That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Deponent met with the Lord</hi> Russel <hi>accidentally at</hi> Shepard'<hi>s House, where as</hi> Shepard <hi>affirm'd the said Lord was come to speak with him about the Money before mention'd. That when the other two had done talking,</hi> Carstares <hi>himself desir'd to speak with the Lord</hi> Russel; <hi>and that in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with him, having reiterated the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position for the</hi> 30000 l. <hi>and the Thousand Horse, and Dragoons, the Lord</hi> Russel <hi>answer'd in these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Words; They could not get so much Money rais'd at the time, but if they had</hi> 10000 l. <hi>to begin, that would draw People in, and when they were once in, they would soon be brought to more. But as for the</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:44330:66"/>
1000 <hi>Horse and Dragoons, he could say nothing at the present, for that behoved to be concerted on the Borders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which plain Deposition, agreeing with so many other Witnesses, it is manifest that when they whom the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> trusted with Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his last Speech, permitted him to affirm on the word of a Dying Man, <hi>He knew nothing of any Design against the King or Kingdom,</hi> either they did grosly prevaricate with him, or he with them.</p>
               <p>His Majesty has judg'd it convenient that the whole Proceeding with the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> should be thus particularly recollected, as well that one great Instance for all might be given of the Impartiality and fair course in which the publick Justice was administer'd against the Conspirators, as also that it might appear with what weak Cavils, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guities and Tergiversations they defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves both living and dying. For the others who were afterwards brought to condign Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will not be so needful to descend into every minute part of their Tryals, Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Executions, which have been already faithfully published; especially since those that followed made most of the same Objections in Law and Fact as were before most solidly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd. It will be enough only to make some few Observations, where any new Matter shall arise, for the fuller Demonstration of the wicked Design.</p>
               <p>On <hi>July</hi> the 13th of that Year, was <hi>John Rouse</hi> brought to Tryal. Against him there was ample
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44330:67"/>
Evidence given. First by <hi>Thomas Lea;</hi> 
                  <q>That the said <hi>Rouse</hi> undertook to provide 100 Arms for the City-Divisions:</q> That he said, <hi>Nothing could be done unless the King were seiz'd;</hi> adding, <hi>We remember Forty One, when the King went and set up his Standard; therefore we will seize them that they shall not set up their Standard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That he farther said, It would be convenient to have a Ball plaid on <hi>Black-Heath;</hi> to that end some Sea-Captains must be spoken to, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to speak to Ten: That when the Ball should be won, every Captain might take his Party, and tell them they had other VVork, and then go with long Boats and Arms to seize the <hi>Tower:</hi> That the said <hi>Rouse</hi> had several such Discourses, and went divers times to view the <hi>Tower</hi> to that end: That after the Discovery he said to <hi>Goodenough</hi> and <hi>Nelthrop, Be not discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, but let the Business go on:</hi> That he said, <hi>Take off the King and the Duke, and then no Man can have Commission to fight for them:</hi> That he also affirm'd, <hi>He was under an Oath of Secrecy, never to trust but one at a time with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then by <hi>William Leigh,</hi> 
                  <q>That the said <hi>Rouse</hi> farther endeavour'd to get Seamen to seize on, and Command some of the Kings Ships, lying as Guard-Ships at <hi>Woolwich</hi> and <hi>Deptford:</hi> That being ask'd, <hi>What he would do with Ships without Powder and Shot, with which they could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided except the</hi> Tower <hi>were surpriz'd?</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>We must secure the</hi> Tower <hi>and</hi> Whitehal <hi>both, or we can do nothing.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:44330:67"/>
And farther, to prove the said <hi>Rouse</hi>'s former Trayterous Temper of Mind against his Majesties Government, it was sworn by Mr. <hi>Corbin,</hi> 
                  <q>That upon some discourse concerning the Parliament at <hi>Oxford, Rouse</hi> said, <hi>He foresaw it would be a short Sessions, but that these frequent Prorogations an Dissolutions of Parliament would not avail him For whatever the King has, the Parliament gave him, and they may take it away when they please: That the King had forfeited his Crown, and had no more Right to it than he had.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Against this all the Defence <hi>Rouse</hi> made was, <q>That the words attested by <hi>Corbin,</hi> were spoken upon a Supposition of the Popes Power over Princes: That as for <hi>William Lea</hi> he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say against him, but hoped he was an honest Man; and for <hi>Thomas Lea,</hi> that the said <hi>Lea</hi> himself first began those Treasonable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, which <hi>Rouse</hi> intended to have revealed, had not the other got the start of him.</q> But this being only supported by his single Yea and Nay, without the Credit of any one Witness to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it, the Jury presently gave their Verdict that he was Guilty.</p>
               <p>For divers Years before he had been a most Notorious <hi>Boutefeu</hi> in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and was one of the many scandalous Examples of the gross Corruption and Iniquity of the <hi>Ignoramus-</hi>Juries of that time; he having been unjustly acquitted by them, when in the Year 1681. he was Indicted of high Crimes, particularly for those Trayterous VVords mentioned in <hi>Corbin</hi>'s Evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:44330:68"/>
But at last the Divine vengeance overtook him in this manner. <q>At his Death among other things he ingenuously confess'd, he had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Sentence pass'd against him; that he had heard and understood too much in several kinds of Meetings, especially of some, who though they call'd themselves True Protestants, were Ten Thousand times worse than any others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>November</hi> the 7th of the said Year 1683, was Colonel <hi>Algernoon Sydney</hi> arraign'd, having sued out his <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> and on the 21st he was brought to his Tryal. He was Indicted <q>for being one of their Great Council of Six; for sending <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and for Writing a most Treasonable Libel against the Government, which was found in his Closet on the Table, when his Papers were seiz'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to the said Colonels having been one of their Council of Six, and present at, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to all their Deliberations, at Mr. <hi>Hamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s and the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the same sense as he had done at the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Tryal; adding now one particular, which more especially affected Colonel <hi>Sydney;</hi> 
                  <q>That the said Colonel, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the Deponent were the first Movers of erecting that Council, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to incline the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> to it, and Mr. <hi>Sydney</hi> promising for the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hambden.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the Second Article, <q>His sending <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> into <hi>Scotland</hi> to invite some Scotch-Men hither, the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> farther witness'd,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44330:68"/>
That at their first Meeting at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s, amongst other matters, it was chiefly debated how to make a coalition of Councils between them and <hi>Scotland;</hi> That to this purpose it was propos'd some fit Person should be thought on to send thither to unite them and the English Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators into one sense and care: That this was discours'd of at the first Meeting.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That at the next, which was at my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s House, every one of the same Persons being present, they fell to Consult of what they had charg'd themselves with the time before, concerning sending into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and also the setling a Correspondence with <hi>Argyle:</hi> That the Scotch Gentlemen Named to be sent to were <hi>Melvin, Cockran</hi> and the <hi>Cambels:</hi> That Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Sydney</hi> offer'd he would take care of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be sent; saying, <hi>he had one in his thought's whom he judg'd a fit Man to be trusted,</hi> naming <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> for the Man: That as many of the Company as knew him, thought him a very proper Person for that employment: That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> undertook to invite <hi>Melvin</hi> hither; and a Letter was to be sent to <hi>Cockran</hi> by <hi>Smith:</hi> That these Scotch-men were to be desired to come, and acquaint their Council here, how they found <hi>Scotland</hi> temper'd; what opportunities or advantages there might be of putting that Kingdom into a Commotion; and how they might there keep time and place with the English.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That shortly after this, the Deponent went to Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi>'s, and found him just going into <hi>London:</hi> That the said Colonel took out of a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44330:69"/>
Cabinet several Guinea's, saying, <hi>They were to be given to</hi> Aaron Smith <hi>for his Expences:</hi> That he was sent accordingly; and the Colonel told the Deponent afterwards, <hi>He was gone, and was upon the Road, and that he had heard from him when he was about</hi> Newcastle.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was next plainly prov'd, That those Scotch-men came up soon after <hi>Smith</hi> arrived there. This was sworn by Sir <hi>Andrew Foster,</hi> that <hi>Cockran, Monroe,</hi> and the two <hi>Cambels</hi> came to Town about the end of the Spring, or the beginning of Summer; <hi>Cockran</hi> and <hi>Monroe</hi> pretending their Business was a Purchase in <hi>Carolina;</hi> and that upon the very first rumour of a Plot, <hi>Cockran</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sconded, <hi>Monroe</hi> and the <hi>Cambels</hi> were taken.</p>
               <p>To this purpose <hi>Attherbury</hi> the Messenger also deposed, <q>That about the end of <hi>June,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>July</hi> 1683. he was sent by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties VVarrant into <hi>London,</hi> upon a discovery of some Scotch-men lodging in <hi>Black-Friers;</hi> but the Common-Sergeant of the City and others having been there before him, found them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their escape in a Boat: That the Persons were Sir <hi>Hugh Cambel, Cockran,</hi> and another: That this was after they had been in Town but a little while.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next Head of the Accusation concern'd the Treasonable Pamphlet found in Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi>'s Study, at the time of his Apprehension. To this, first Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> Clerk of his Majesties Council deposed, <q>That having been sent by the King and Council to seize Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, he did go, and put up what he found in his Closet: That he found those Papers now
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44330:69"/>
given in Evidence lying upon his Table where he usually writ: That he seiz'd them towards the later end of <hi>June:</hi> That having put them up, he offer'd Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi> that he might Seal them with his own Seal, but he refusing, the Deponent set his Seal to them, and so deliver'd them to the Council.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next it was made out, by as firm Proof as such a matter will bear, That all the Sheets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced were of Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi>'s own Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which was evidenc'd by Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> Men of known Repute and Credit, who had long dealt with Mr. <hi>Sydney</hi> in Matters of Money, and had paid divers Bills of Exchange for him, upon Notes written in the same Hand, and were never call'd to any account for Mis-payment.</p>
               <p>Then were the Papers read, containing rank Treason almost in every Line.</p>
               <p>For therein were broach'd and asserted many horrible Doctrines both against Monarchy in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the English Monarchy in particular: which according to the usual false Reasoning of all Republican Writers, he endeavour'd to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie by divers Quotations and Examples of Sacred and Prophane History grosly perverted, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied against the present Government of his Country.</p>
               <p>In short, the whole design of those Papers was to maintain, <hi>That Tyrants may be justly deposed by the People; and that the People are the only Judges who are Tyrants;</hi> And peculiarly concerning this Nation there are these Expressions:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:44330:70"/>
                  <q>The Power originally in the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is delegated to the Parliament. He, the King, is subject to the Law of God, as he is a Man; to the People that makes him a King, in as much as he is a King: The Law sets a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to that Subjection: The Parliament is Judge of the particular Cases thereupon arising: He must be content to submit his Interest to theirs, since he is no more than any one of them in any other respect, than that he is by consent of all rais'd above any other: If he doth not like this Condition, he may renounce the Crown: But if he receive it upon this Condition, (as all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates do the Power they receive) and swear to perform it, he must expect the Performance will be exacted, or Revenge taken by those he hath betray'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in another place he says, <q>We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore change or take away Kings without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Yoak; or that is made a Yoak, which ought not to be one. The Injury is in making, and imposing, and there can be none in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in another, <q>That the People must needs be the Judge of what happens between them, and the King, whom they did constitute. And in another, that as for the Peoples being Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in their own Cases, it is plain they ought to be the only Judges.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in another, <q>That the Power of calling and dissolving Parliaments is not in the King.</q> And in another, <q>That the general revolt of a Nation from its own Magistrates can never be call'd a Rebellion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:44330:70"/>
These are some of the Treasonable Tenets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Mr. <hi>Sydney</hi>'s Papers, amongst many other Assertions that are equally Criminal, but too long to be here inserted. Concerning all which Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Opinions this is certainly known, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd by all good Men, That as they laid the Foundations of the late miserable War against his Majesties blessed Father; and thereby occasion'd the spilling so much Blood, even of the Royal Blood it self; so when-ever the Multitude shall be infected with the like Antimonarchical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, it will be impossible for the best Kings, or the most happy Kingdoms in the VVorld, to be free from perpetual Treasons, and Rebellious Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
               <p>To all this Colonel <hi>Sydney</hi>'s Answer being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made up of most of the same Pleas in Law that had been over-ruled, and the same Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> which were satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily repell'd in the former Tryals: besides that he only barely deny'd the sending of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Smith,</hi> and his having any hand in, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that Message: And as for his Treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Papers, he would not grant them to be his, or if they were found in his Study, he affirm'd <hi>That they might have been written many Years ago in answer to Sir</hi> R. Philmer'<hi>s Book of Monarchy; and written with no intention of publishing them, but only for private diversion, and the exercise of his Pen.</hi> In short, his Defence consisting rather in Nice Cavils at the known Forms of Law, or Discourses ridiculing the Design of a Council of Six, and the whole Conspiracy it self, than in any solid Arguments or Evidence to invalidate
<pb facs="tcp:44330:71"/>
the VVitnesses, or to clear himself from the Crimes proved upon him, he was presently found Guilty.</p>
               <p>His Execution in respect of his Quality, his Majesty alter'd from the usual Punishment of High Treason, into that of Severing his Head from his Body. At the time of his Death on <hi>December</hi> the 7th he also deliver'd the Sheriffs a Written Paper: Wherein, after having excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his not speaking what he wrote, by alledging this reason among others, <hi>That this was an Age, which makes Truth pass for Treason;</hi> he objects against the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> the Infamy of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Life; which Objection no Man in <hi>England</hi> had less cause to make than himself, the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> and he having been known to be entire Confidents, Familiars and Friends for many Years past of their Lives, and till the very time of the Discovery.</p>
               <p>Touching his Papers produced against him, he gives an account full of manifest Equivocations, and ambiguous Reservations. He sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates <hi>they were his own;</hi> but implies <hi>they were written long ago, against a Book of Controversie in Matters of Government.</hi> Thereupon he goes on, openly to justifie those Papers, by Positions dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enough to the Publick Peace, but quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what was laid to his charge at his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and was quoted word by word out of those Papers. For in stead of being a general Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course for the Peoples Rights against Kings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any particular Applications to Time or Place, as in this his last Paper he insinuates them to have been; it is apparent to any Man that can but read,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44330:71"/>
that those Sheets of his VVriting, which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Evidence, strook at the very Root of the English Monarchy, and that therein he studied to do his part to bring the Ax very near the Kings Neck once again.</p>
               <p>He farther, in that printed Speech, most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously reviles his Judges, affirming with noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious falshood and petulancy, <hi>That lest the Means of destroying the best Protestants in</hi> England <hi>should fail, the Bench was fill'd with such as had been Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes to the Bar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He goes on to make divers the like frivolous and groundless Reflections on the legal and regular Proceedings against him; concluding with a Prayer that could be dictated by none but a fierce Republican, and a furious Enthusiastical Spirit met together. It was in truth a Prayer more proper for their Treasonable Meetings at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s or the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s, than to be used as the last words of a Gentleman dying in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his Innocency.</p>
               <p>For after having fondly declar'd, That <hi>he fell a Sacrifice to Idols,</hi> he thus addresses his Speech to the great God of Heaven: <hi>Bless thy People, and save them. Defend thy own Cause; Defend those that defend it. Stir up such as are faint. Direct those that are willing. Confirm those that waver. Give Wisdom and Integrity unto all. Grant that I may die glorifying thee for all thy Mercies; and that at the last thou hast permitted me to be singled out as a Witness of thy Truth; and even by the Confession of my Opposers, for that</hi> Old Cause <hi>in which I was from my Youth engaged, and for which thou hast of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wonderfully declar'd thy self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:44330:72"/>
He makes it his last Glory, <hi>That he was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g'd in that Old Cause from his Youth;</hi> and he was so. Being yet very Young he took up Rebellious Arms against his Majesties Blessed Father, and merited so well of that Old Cause, that he was thought rightly qualifi'd to be Named, though he did not actually sit, amongst the black Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Regicides.</p>
               <p>Upon his Majesties most happy Return, his fixt aversion to the restor'd Government was such, that he would not personally accept of the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion and Indempnity then generally granted to the whole Nation. But he voluntarily banish'd himself for many Years; till about the Year 1677, he came into <hi>England</hi> again and by his Majesties special Grace, obtain'd a particular Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, upon repeated promises of constant quiet, and Obedience for the time to come: Which how he made good, the World may Judge. In fine, he fell a memorable warning, and fatal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the English Nobility and Gentry of this, and all future Ages; that they should take heed of being so far infatuated with the fancie and Chimerical Felicities of Antient or Modern Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, as to despise and attempt the ruine of the far more solid Liberty and happiness to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd under the English Monarchy.</p>
               <p>On the 28th Day of <hi>November</hi> 1683, Mr. <hi>John Hambden</hi> Junior, having also sued out his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> was arraign'd for High Misdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, and brought to his Tryal the 6th of <hi>February</hi> following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:44330:72"/>
In this Tryal, the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the same sense as before touching the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Transactions of the Conspiracy till the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Death; and particularly afterwards of the Meeting of the Council of Six at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s own House, where Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> made an Introductory Speech to open the Assembly; and the subject of their Debates was concerning the Time, Place, Men, Arms and Money to be provided towards a Rising; and also that then the sending a Messenger into <hi>Scotland</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and referred to be debated the next Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Farther, That Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was present at that next Meeting at the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s House; and amongst the rest deliberated of sending the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger into <hi>Scotland;</hi> when <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and approved to be the Man.</p>
               <p>But the substance of the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence having been before sufficiently set down, it will be needless now to follow exactly every Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of it. It is enough only to note, That most of the same Objections being again repeated by the Defendents Council, had the same or like Answers return'd them by the Kings.</p>
               <p>There was indeed one new and very material thing then first particularly and unquestionably made out in this Tryal, which was the certainty of <hi>Aaron Smith</hi>'s carrying the Treasonable Message in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland.</hi> This was now demonstrably proved by <hi>Sheriff</hi> and <hi>Bell,</hi> both Inhabitants of <hi>Newcastle; Sheriff</hi> being the <hi>Man</hi> at whose House <hi>Smith</hi> lay in his passage to and fro, and <hi>Bell</hi> the very Guide that went thence to conduct him into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:44330:73"/>
Touching this Matter; First, <hi>Attherbury</hi> one of the Kings Messengers testified, <q>That <hi>Sheriff</hi> and <hi>Bell</hi> had a full view of <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> who was brought for that purpose from the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> before the King: That <hi>Sheriff</hi> and <hi>Bell</hi> did then own <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> to be the Man who had pass'd under the Name of <hi>Clerk:</hi> That <hi>Sheriff</hi> declar'd the said <hi>Clerk</hi> lay at his House; and <hi>Bell</hi> said that he travell'd towards <hi>Scotland</hi> with him, being hired to shew him the way: That to all this <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> would not answer one word.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Sheriff</hi> himself deposed, <q>That he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Black-Spread-Eagle</hi> in <hi>Newcastle, Aaron Smith</hi> came to his House about the middle of <hi>February</hi> 1683: That he staid there one Night, went away, and return'd again in twelve days, or thereabout: That he travell'd from his House Northward towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> but first desir'd one might be got to shew him the way: That to that purpose the Deponent sent for <hi>Bell,</hi> whom <hi>Smith</hi> presently hired to go with him: That when <hi>Smith</hi> came back, he lay another Night at his House, and so return'd into the South to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>London:</hi> That <hi>Smith</hi> went all the while by the Name of <hi>Clerk:</hi> That the Deponent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him to a Gentleman at <hi>Jadburgh,</hi> which is Forty Miles from <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and within Six Miles of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Bell</hi> swore, <q>That <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was the very Man who went by the Name of <hi>Clerk.</hi> That the Deponent living at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and getting his Livelyhood by letting out Horses and guiding of Travellers; <hi>Sheriff</hi> sent for him,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44330:73"/>
told him the said <hi>Clerk</hi> wanted a Guide into <hi>Scotland:</hi> That this happen'd on the <hi>Thursday</hi> before <hi>Shrove Tuesday:</hi> That the next Morning being <hi>Friday,</hi> he conducted <hi>Smith</hi> towards <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi> that on the <hi>Saturday</hi> the Deponents Horse was tyr'd; so <hi>Smith</hi> left him taking ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Guide; appointing him to come after as fast as he could to <hi>Jadburgh:</hi> That the Deponent overtook him there on <hi>Sunday;</hi> and on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning saw him take Horse with another Guide for <hi>Scotland,</hi> saying he was going towards <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas:</hi> That <hi>Bell</hi> presently went back to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle:</hi> where he saw <hi>Smith</hi> and discours'd with him, upon his return out of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then it was also proved by Sir <hi>Andrew Foster</hi> and <hi>Attherbury,</hi> 
                  <q>That the Scotch-Men sent for by <hi>Smiths</hi> Message, did come, and staid in Town, till upon the Discovery of the Plot, they were either taken or absconded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this plain Evidence of the several Stages of <hi>Smith</hi>'s Journy, that Treasonable intercourse with <hi>Scotland</hi> was made out beyond all possibility of Confutation. So that from the very time of the Consultations at Mr. <hi>Hambdens,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s about sending a Messenger; the Truth of Colonel <hi>Sydneys</hi> undertaking to send one; of his naming <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> for the Messenger; of <hi>Smith</hi>'s going to <hi>Scotland;</hi> of the Scotch Mens coming up that were sent for; and of their being surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, endeavouring to hide themselves, upon the first breaking forth of the Plot; all this appears to be indisputably confirm'd, and trac'd step by step, almost from Day to Day, especially if these <hi>Newcastle</hi> Mens Depositions shall be compar'd with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44330:74"/>
the Testimony that is subjoin'd of two Scotch-Men <hi>Thomas Steil,</hi> and <hi>Oliver,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aaron Smith</hi>'s actual arrival in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and what he did whilst he was there at that time.</p>
               <p>The issue was, Mr. <hi>Hambden was immediately found Guilty of the High Trespass and Misdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, and thereupon fined</hi> 40000 l. <hi>to the King, and order'd to give Sureties for his Good Behavior during Life.</hi> A Punishment that cannot but be esteem'd very moderate, considering the Nature of his Crime, which nothing but the want of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther positive Witness could have made less than High Treason. And the King cannot but here take this occasion once for all, to give the World Notice of this Infallible Instance of his mild and merciful Proceedings towards the Conspirators. For his Majesty does solemnly declare, <q>That if he had not granted the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, <hi>That he would not make him a Witness,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> nor scarce any one Man of all those that were freed upon Bail, had escaped Death.</q> Not to mention divers others, whom the said Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> named as Parties in the Conspiracy, that were never yet question'd.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of <hi>June</hi> 1684. Sir <hi>Thomas Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong</hi> having been taken in <hi>Holland,</hi> was brought to the <hi>Kings-Bench-Bar,</hi> upon an Outlawry against him for High Treason. Whereupon the Kings Atturney demanded <hi>An Award of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Since upon his not appearing, when former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Indicted of High Treason, he was now by the course of Law attainted for the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:44330:74"/>
                  <hi>Armstrong</hi> being ask'd, <hi>What he could say for himself?</hi> alledg'd, <hi>He was beyond Sea at the time of the Outlawry, and beg'd he might be Try'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was answer'd, <hi>That after a Record of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry, the Judges had nothing to do but to appoint Execution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Against this <hi>Armstrong</hi> urg'd, <hi>That by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 6th of</hi> Edward the Sixth, <hi>the Person Outlaw'd had a Years time to Reverse the Outlawry, if he were beyond Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bench reply'd, <q>That by the plain words of that Statute, none could have the benefit of it, but such as within one Year should yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Chief Justice of <hi>England,</hi> and offer to Traverse the Indictment upon which the Outlawry was Pronounc'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>Armstrong</hi> pleaded, <hi>That the Year not being yet out, he did now render himself to the Chief Justice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that Plea not being admitted, because he did not yield himself according to the sense of the Act, but was brought a Prisoner, and so could have no Advantage of the Proviso in the Statute; <hi>Armstrong</hi> alledg'd, <q>That the same Favour had been lately granted to another, meaning <hi>Holloway,</hi> who though he was in the same Condition of Outlawry, yet was offer'd to take his Tryal if he pleas'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was answer'd, <q>That was done out of the meer Grace and Favour of the King, who if his Majesty thought good might extend the like Favour to him also. But that was not the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Court of Justice; they were only to take care to satisfie the Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:44330:75"/>
Moreover, the Kings Atturney acquainted the Court, <q>That the Prisoner at the Bar deserv'd no sort of Indulgence or Mercy from the King; not only for that when he was seiz'd beyond Sea, Letters of fresh Communication with Foreign Ministers and other People were taken about him, but also because it appear'd to his Majesty by full Evidence positively given, That after the Disappointment of the Meeting at the <hi>Rye</hi> by Gods Providence in the Fire at <hi>Newmarket, Armstrong</hi> was one of the Persons that actually engag'd to go upon the Kings hasty coming to Town, and to destroy him by the way as he came.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then was he order'd to be Executed <hi>June</hi> the 20th. At the place of Execution he likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd the Sheriffs a Paper, wherein he continued to Object against the legal Course of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon him, complaining, <q>That with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary roughness he had been condemn'd, and made a President, though <hi>Holloway,</hi> being also Outlaw'd, had his Tryal offer'd him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to the new Evidence against him, which the Kings Atturney mention'd at the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> he only answer'd it by a bold and flat denial; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming upon his Death, <hi>He never had any Design against the Kings Life, nor the Life of any Man;</hi> both which may be easily allow'd to be equally true.</p>
               <p>But to evince the contrary as to the Kings Life, it will be sufficient to set down the very words of the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Deposition, together with the Testimony of Colonel <hi>Romzey,</hi> which the Kings Atturney had then ready to produce, amongst
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44330:75"/>
many other old and clear Proofs to convince him of designing the Kings Destruction.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> having first confess'd some Discourse between the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and himself, in <hi>October</hi> of 1683, wherein the said Duke had proposed the falling on the King at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> goes on in these words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Upon Reflection I am apt to think, that from this time and not before, the Design of way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the King in his return to <hi>London,</hi> was first meditated. And I am the more confirm'd in this Opinion from the Consideration of the Behaviour of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and the Lord <hi>Gray;</hi> who seem'd to be very big of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of some great thing to be attempted upon the Day of the Kings coming from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market;</hi> upon which Day (as I have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd) Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> was not be found till the Kings Coaches were come into Town: And I do verily believe he was to have Headed the Party.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This very Particular the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> gave in upon Oath among his first Confessions to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. Nor can any Man think it sufficient to invalidate the Truth of this, that <hi>Armstrong</hi> in his last Paper calls it a <hi>base Reflection,</hi> affirming <hi>He could have prov'd it to be a manifest Falshood;</hi> considering that Colonel <hi>Romzey</hi> also upon notice of <hi>Armstrong</hi>'s being taken, made Oath in these very words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> did come to me the <hi>Sunday-</hi>Night after the Fire at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and told me, That he just came from <hi>Ferguson,</hi> and that notwithstanding the King and Duke
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44330:76"/>
were to return so soon, yet <hi>Ferguson</hi> did not doubt to have Men ready by that time to do the Business; and desired me to go with him to <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s Lodging in his Coach, which I did. When I came there, <hi>Ferguson</hi> told me the same, but that they wanted Money. Upon which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> desired me to Lend some, and he would see me Repaid; and added, That if he had been in Stock, he would have done it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the King could not think himself in the least bound to go out of the way of the Law, for shewing any distinguishing Act of Grace to Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong;</hi> especially when it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest there was scarce a Man living, who had more Personal obligations to his Majesty than he had; and yet no Man had made more ungrateful returns for them, than he had done. Nor could his Majesty forget, how many other Persons, and some very near his Majesty, Sir <hi>Thomas Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong</hi> had been the Chief Instrument of pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Upon which account his Majesty had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to look on him, as the Author of many more Treasons besides his own.</p>
               <p>There is now scarce any thing material left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd relating to the Proof either of the Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sination or Insurrection, but what may be readily supplied, by any intelligent Reader, out of the Original Records of Informations and Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereof by his Majesties Command, there are Copies annext to this Narration for an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Confirmation of its Truth. Only the King is pleas'd that a more particular account should be given than has been hitherto made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44330:76"/>
of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s rendring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, of the Reasons then moving his Majesty to grant him his Pardon, and of what happen'd immediately upon it, which occasion'd the said Dukes final Disgrace and Banishment from his Majesties presence.</p>
               <p>As to the late Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Murdering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the <hi>Tower</hi> some few Days after his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment there, His Majesty cannot think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him to descend to any particular Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own, or his Ministers Innocency in that Calamitous Accident.</p>
               <p>Though his Majesty is not Ignorant, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers most Malicious Pamphlets have been lately spread abroad in English, and other Languages, which with an unparellell'd Impudence have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd several Persons of eminent Virtue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour about his Majesty, not sparing even his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highness; nay scarce freeing the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, from being Personally Conscious of so Base and Barbarous an Action.</p>
               <p>But after the Truth of the whole matter has been carefully examin'd and asserted by the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Inquest, whose proper Business it was; and after <hi>Braddon</hi> has suffer'd the Punishment of the Law, for Suborning even Children to bear false Witness in the Case; and after the Notoriety of the Fact, and all the Circumstances of it, have been so clearly made out, that there is not a Man in all <hi>England,</hi> of an honest Mind, or sound Sense, who does in the least doubt it; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty disdains to enter into dispute with every Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44330:77"/>
Scribler, or to answer the villanous Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and horrid Calumnies contain'd particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Libel call'd <hi>The Detection,</hi> and in the Epitome of it; the one written by <hi>Ferguson,</hi> the other by <hi>Danvers;</hi> both infamous Men, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemies to his Majesties Government and Person.</p>
               <p>Yet his Majesty cannot but think it deserves Observation, That when the late Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had so many considerable Relations and Alliances with divers the greatest Families in the Kingdom; and when neither his Lady, nor Brother, nor any one of all his Numerous Friends and Noble Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, who were most nearly concern'd, did ever express the least Jealousie of foul dealing or ill practise upon the said unfortunate Earl; and when all Mens Eyes are open'd, and scarce a Man of their own Party has any scruple in his Thoughts about that Business; yet that now at last their old Advocate of Treason <hi>Ferguson</hi> should come forth in Print, to out-face so clear a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of Truth, and should try still to turn the Envy of that unhappy Stroak on the Court, and the King, and his dearest Brother. It cannot but seem a prodigious Confidence and Presumption, that <hi>Ferguson</hi> should be their chosen Champion in this Cause! The Man, who by so many Depositions stands Outlaw'd and Convict of having had the greatest share in the blackest part of the Conspiracy! The Man, in accusing whom almost every Witness both Scotch and English consented, so that his Crimes have been proved by more than Twenty plain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; particularly the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

having confess'd to his Majesty, <hi>That in all their Debates,</hi> Ferguson <hi>was always for Cutting of Throats;</hi> saying, <hi>That was the most Compendious Way.</hi> That this very <hi>Ferguson</hi> should so far make good his own words at parting, when he vow'd <hi>He would never be out of a Plot as long as he liv'd!</hi> That now in his Banishment under the load of so many undeniable Treasons, he should still appear as the great Patron of the Old Cause, and should presume he can impose on the World in a matter of Fact so fully try'd, so clearly prov'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined! What can be a greater Impudence, than that <hi>Ferguson</hi> should still expect that he could make any Man living believe, the King himself, or the Duke of <hi>York</hi> could ever be induced to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise his <hi>Compendious Way</hi> on the Earl of <hi>Essex?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However from this one instance the King hopes the World will judge, how most Injuriously and Barbarously he has been used by his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in their other Libels against him; in most of which it is well known the same venemous Pen was employ'd.</p>
               <p>As for the deplorable end of the said Earl, his Majesty freely owns, there was no Man in his Dominions more deeply afflicted with it than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: His Majesty having been thereby deprived of an extraordinary Opportunity to exercise his Royal Clemency; and to testifie to all his Loyal Subjects and Old Friends, how highly he valued the Memory and Sufferings of the Lord <hi>Capel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next himself, his Majesty thinks he is also bound in common Justice to declare, That his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely beloved Brother was most tenderly concern'd and griev'd at that lamentable Effect of the Earl
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44330:78"/>
of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Despair: His Majesty being best able, upon his own knowledge to vouch for the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> That he never deserv'd ill of the said Earl, and was always most readily inclined, for both their Fathers sakes, to have forgiven whatever ill the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had done to him.</p>
               <p>Now touching his Majesties Pardoning the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and what followed upon it, the King is pleased this Account shall be given.</p>
               <p>The World needs not be told with what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary regret to his Majesty, the said Duke was of late Years perverted from that sense of his Duty and Allegiance, his Majesty might justly claim from him, upon many more Obligations besides that of being his Subject.</p>
               <p>But it was one of the first and principal Artifices of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Malice, after his own disgrace at Court, to be reveng'd on the King, by afflicting him in so tender a part, and by fly Insinuations, to wrest from his Bosom a Person, who he knew, had so great a share in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Affections.</p>
               <p>This was indeed a Talent peculiar to the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> That of all Men living he could most easily turn himself into all shapes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with all Dispositions; having by long practise, got the skill to cover his Hooks with Baits fitting every Humour. The Covetous, who are no small Number of the pretended Godly Party, those he was wont to feed, and deceive with hopes of Wealth and new Sequestrations: The Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with Praise and Vain-Glory: The Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44330:78"/>
Zealots, with Promises of Liberty in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; sometimes not refusing to stoop lower, and even to serve and assist the Pleasures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches of Men that way inclin'd, if he found them any way useful for his purpose.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the said Earl observing in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> a Mind rash, unsteady and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, soon made him an easie Prey to his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Subtilty, disguised under fair and plausible Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: On the one side, puffing up his Youthful Thoughts with a vain Ostentation of Honour, and the Temptation of Fame to be gotten by As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting and Defending his Countries Liberties and Religion, always pretended by him to be in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger, whilst He was out of place: On the other, inflaming him with imaginary Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s irreconcileable Hatred to his Person. Which was so far from having any real Foundation, that on the contrary, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, who best knows, does freely here testifie for his dearest Brother in this particular, That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> till he made himself unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of his Friendship, never had a more entire, or fast Friend about his Majesty; and there was scarce ever any Honour or Benefit conferr'd on him, but it was obtain'd of his Majesty by his Royal Highnesses Intercession.</p>
               <p>However by such groundless Jealousies and empty Conceits, was the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> insensibly drawn to desert his only true Interest; and to give himself over to the Delusions of his Majesties mortal Enemies.</p>
               <p>This the King apparently perceiving, and foreseeing how in the event it would tend to the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44330:79"/>
said Dukes inevitable Ruine, his Majesty tryed by all imaginable ways of Kindness to cast forth the Evil Spirit in him, and to rescue him out of their Hands. At length, when no milder course would serve, his Majesty required him on his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, to go beyond the Seas, and there to remain till his farther pleasure was signified. His Majesty still hopeing, that at so great a distance the Poyson would be less effectual, and that by his absence the said Duke would be kept Innocent of the Treasonable designs which his New As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates were furiously carrying on against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>But in that expectation his Majesty was unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately disappointed. The Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> presently shew'd, how much his false Friends and Treacherous Flatterers had prevailed over his unwary Youth; and how different they had taught him to be from the Obedience, which at the same time was practised by his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For the said Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into <hi>England</hi> contrary to his Majesties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Command.</p>
               <p>The discontented Party having thus got him again, and made him surer to themselves by this new Affront to his Majesty, began now to take new Life and Vigour by his presence: With insufferable Boldness and Contempt of Authority, shewed him every where to the Rabble; Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him about with insolent Pomp, through many Countries; openly owning and crying him up as the Head of their Cause; the unhappy Young-Man all the while not understanding that he was only a Property.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:44330:79"/>
By these fatal steps he was at last brought into the most pernicious Counsels and undertakings. And whilst nothing less was intended by his Tempters but the subversion of all that is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled and sacred in Church and State; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded him into the very same Designs, by popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar shews and empty Names of the Protestant Duke, the great Champion and Protector of the Privileges of the Subject and the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Which under his Majesty, can never want any other Protector; nor can ever stand in need of such Champions as many of late have vaunted themselves to be, of whose Religion there can be given no better Account than of their Loyalty.</p>
               <p>Such then was the state of things, when upon the first breaking forth of this Horrid Conspiracy, his Majesty with inexpressible surprize and Grief, Found by undoubted Evidence the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> very deeply engaged; and therefore had but too just reason to put him into a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation among the other Conspirators: After that the said Duke had withdrawn himself from his Majesties Justice, and so long was become incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his Forgiveness.</p>
               <p>In this obstinate defiance the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> continued, till the Outlawry against him, and other his Complices began to draw to an Issue. Then his Majesty receiv'd from him the first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: In which his Majesty fancy'd he saw a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Spirit of Ingenuity than afterwards proved. However finding in it so clear and full expressions of the said Dukes remorse for his former Disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to his Majesty and Ingratitude to the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44330:80"/>
Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and so frank professions of his Resolutions to amend for the future, joyn'd with the greatest Imprecations on himself; if he should wilfully violate his promises therein made: his Majesty did thereupon immediately return this Answer written with his own Hand, (that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty might not be wanting on his part to lay hold on any good and probable Opportunity of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to Reason, and saving him from utter Ruine:) <hi>If the Duke of</hi> Monmouth <hi>desires to make himself capable of my Mercy, he must render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Secretary, and resolve to tell me all he knows, resigning himself entirely to my Pleasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This determinate Declaration of his Majesties Will, drew from the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> a second Letter; wherein with vehement and pathetick Words he aggravates his Distraction and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for having offended his Majesty. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses <hi>Himself in fault, betray'd into fatal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, misled into Mischiefs, whereof he did not at first in the least suspect the Consequences:</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>That his Crime appear'd to him in so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a shape, that he preferr'd even Death before his present sense of it:</hi> implores <hi>His Majesties Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don no otherwise, but if he may receive it by his Royal Highnesses Mediation:</hi> professes <hi>To speak this not only in outward Form, but with the greatest Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the World:</hi> resigns <hi>Himself to his Majesties Disposal, not only now, but for the remainder of his Life:</hi> engages <hi>Absolutely to put his very Will into his Majesties Hands for the future, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges had been so ill a Guide to him in times past:</hi> concluding, <hi>That till he could receive some comfortable Return to this his unfeigned Submission,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44330:80"/>
he was the most miserable, disconsolate Creature li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the receipt of this second Letter, the King being perswaded there could be no room left to question the Sincerity of a real Change in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and knowing he had now enough in his Hands to overwhelm him with Confusion, if it should prove otherwise, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty did thereupon without any more reserve, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately admit him into his Presence, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Secretary was withdrawn, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none else present but his Royal Highness, his Majesty can have no other Testimony besides of what past between them but God, who knows all things; And to the same God his Majesty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, as well as to his dearest Brother: Nothing doubting but if the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> shall ever return to any sense of his Duty to God and his King, he himself will be a third Witness of the Truth of what his Majesty now declares; <hi>That the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>with Signs of the most humble Contrition and sincere Sorrow for his past Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, did then fully and freely acknowledge his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Conscious of the Conspiracy; and gave his Majesty much greater Light into many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of it than he could possibly else have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, his Majesty does not deny the said Duke persisted to the last in renouncing any the least knowledge or thought of the Assassinating part. Nor did his Majesty much press him on that side; his Royal Indulgence easily inclining him to wish and to believe, That One who had the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44330:81"/>
Honour to be taken so near to him, could not be guilty of so vile a Parricide.</p>
               <p>But of the other part, the Trayterous Design to seize on his Majesties Person, and subvert the present Government by an Insurrection; of that his Majesty must own and profess on the Word of a King, The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> made no scruple to confess his share; and so largely to set it forth, that there was little of the Conspiracy before known, which the said Duke did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; and many Passages of it were before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, which he reveal'd.</p>
               <p>After this his Majesty made no delay to give him many certain Proofs of his entire Forgiveness of all past Offences, and of his renew'd Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Royal Bounty to him for the future; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently cherishing him near his own Person with his wonted Tenderness; declaring in Council the perfect Contentment he had receiv'd by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and ordering his Pardon to be dispatch'd with all expedition; promising him withal at his earnest Intreaty, <hi>That he should not be a Witness;</hi> a Favour refused to the late Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> in <hi>France</hi> upon the like occasion.</p>
               <p>Yet no sooner was the Pardon compleated in due Form of Law, but his Majesty and the whole Court was afresh Alarm'd with the continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to him of divers Persons, whom his Majesty knew to be engag'd, and had Proof sufficient to Convict them in course of Law, if he would have produced it all.</p>
               <p>To this at the same time were added many arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and impudent Speeches of his late Complices and Dependants, saying, <q>That the said Duke had
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44330:81"/>
made no Confession, but had asserted the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of some that had suffer'd.</q> Which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly tended to vilifie the Truth of the whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and to bring a Scandal on all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of his Majesties Justice.</p>
               <p>Wherefore at last his Majesty was awaken'd, and thought fit to put him gently in mind by what was so lately past, of his danger of relapsing into the same Precipice, out of which nothing but his Royal Goodness had recover'd him. And for the better Security of the said Duke himself, as well as of the Kingdom for the time to come, his Majesty instantly demanded of him to give some such Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the whole Nation in publick, as he had but just before given to his Majesty and his Royal Highness in private.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> seeming willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his Majesties most Gracious Desires, all that his Majesty obliged him to do, was to Write over, and Subscribe a Letter, which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty himself was pleas'd so to word, as not only to consult the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Safety, but also his Credit, as much as could possibly stand with his Majesties own Safety or Credit. For his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty permitted him in that Letter wholly to acquit himself of the Bloody Assassination, and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to own again his part in the Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And his Majesty leaves it to all the World to Judge, whether in this Letter, of his Majesties own prescribing, he did not express the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Guilt far more tenderly, than the said Duke himself had done in his own Letters to his Majesty, before his Pardon was Sealed.</p>
               <p>This Letter the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> readily
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44330:82"/>
Subscribed, and Presented to his Majesty. But his former ill Adherents and Corrupters still Flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about him in great Numbers, and Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to <hi>continue Faithful to his Old Friends of the Party;</hi> assuring him, <hi>he could not fail in little time to overbear all that should stand in his way, by the Power of his recover'd and increas'd Favour;</hi> by these and such like Mischievous Instigations, they soon got so much the better of his unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mind, as to overthrow all his new-made Vows of Loyalty.</p>
               <p>Insomuch that presently after he came rashly to the King, <hi>and earnestly intreated the foresaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might be return'd him again;</hi> having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed to pretend a Fear, <hi>that some opportunity might be taken from it by his Enemies to blast his Reputation, and perhaps to bring him in to give Evidence against others his Companions in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majesty had often before said and promised enough to him to free the Mind of any reasonable Man from such Jealousies. But when all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations of that kind, on his Majesties Part, could have no effect; and the said Duke still vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insisted, <hi>That the Paper he had sign'd might be delivered him back,</hi> his Majesty once for all told him, <hi>he would never keep it against his will,</hi> that he might not have the least occasion to say he was forced to write what he did: But withal seriously warn'd him to consider what irreparable ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences on his part, were likely to follow upon his obstinacy: And therefore gave him time till the next Morning to deliberate calmly with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, what was to be his final Resolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:44330:82"/>
The next Day the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing still more fixt in his perverse Demand, his Majesty freely put the Letter again into his Hands; but withal from that moment banish'd him his Presence and the Court.</p>
               <p>Nor can his Majesty reflect on the said Duke's undutiful Behaviour in the issue of this whole Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, without an extream Indignation, to find, that after so submissive and ample a Confession of his Crime, both by VVriting and Speech, he should not only give no other sign of his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but that the very first use he should make of his Majesties Gracious Pardon for it, was to take by it the advantage of entring more securely on a new course of Disobedience.</p>
               <p>The King has thus condescended to set forth an Impartial Relation of the Beginning, Proceeding and Defeat of that whole detestable Conspiracy. His Majesty has so long delay'd the Publication of it, chiefly in Consideration of many of the Criminals themselves, how ill soever they may have deserv'd of him. For the Law allowing them the space of a whole Year, after the Outlawry, to render themselves before they were to be look'd on as Men absolutely condemn'd, his Majesty was willing to stay till the full time was expired; still hoping, that some of them would come volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in, and stand a Legal Tryal, and, if possible, prove themselves Innocent.</p>
               <p>But since not one of the Persons Outlaw'd has all this while ventured himself on the Laws of his Country, his Majesty has now thought it not fit any longer to suppress the Evidence against them.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44330:83"/>
And what is here publish'd, though it be not near the whole of the Informations given in upon Oath, yet will be found abundantly sufficient to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict every Man of them, either of the intended Insurrection or Assassination; Both which his Majesty knows are made out with as much clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Testimony, and strength of indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Records, as any Humane Affair is capable of.</p>
               <p>VVhat now remains? But that his Majesty should engage himself before God and the whole World, to make a right use of so great a Blessing as his Deliverance from these desperate Treasons; and should with the Authority of a King, and with the tender Affection of a true Father of his Country, require and admonish all his Subjects of all Parties and Opinions, to do the like.</p>
               <p>For himself, his Majesty cannot but be deeply sensible he has been now once more preserv'd by the immediate Hand of God; and therefore looks on himself as afresh obliged to manifest his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to Heaven, by promoting the Glory of his Preserver, in continuing to consult above all things the VVelfare of his Church, and the Peace and Happiness of this great People committed to his Charge.</p>
               <p>And his Majesty declares he will improve this new Advantage the Divine Favour has so mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellously put into his Hands, not in Acts of Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Revenge, which his Nature utterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors; but by imitating the Divine Goodness, as in a regular Course of strict Justice to all obdurate Impenitents, so, which he much rather desires, in his usual method of Mercy and Kindness to as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44330:83"/>
many as shall give sincere Proofs of Penitence, and Reformation of their past Crimes; Virtues which his Majesty has too much Reason to believe his and his Fathers Enemies have hitherto been very little acquainted with.</p>
               <p>As for those his Majesties misguided Subjects, who after all this persevere to be disaffected to his Government, his Majesty has reason to expect that now at length they would be convinc'd by that very Providence which used to be their own principal and best-beloved Argument, whenever it seem'd to be never so little on their side; and that henceforth they would quietly submit to, and follow the same Providence; since it has so signal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear'd against them, and much more Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully declar'd it self for, than ever Mr. <hi>Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> had reason to say, it had declar'd against his Majesty.</p>
               <p>If there can possibly still remain any well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men in their Party, led away by the specious Delusions of good Words abused to the worst things; if any such have really thought their Lives and Fortunes, Laws and Consciences at any time in Danger, under his Majesties Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; let them but Remember and consider sadly what was the Issue of the very same Jealousies, Murmurs and Tumults against his Royal Father of Blessed Memory; whether the first and most eminent Instruments of subverting, for a time, this renown'd, and antient Monarchy, were not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves beguil'd by the same Methods into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Slavery, both Spiritual and Temporal: Out of which, they were compell'd at last to confess, they could be no otherwise redeem'd, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44330:84"/>
again into the very same constitution of things, they had so unwisely overthrown?</p>
               <p>Or if the Experience of time past, so dearly bought, can prevail nothing on them, let them but seriously reflect on their present Condition. In stead of harkening to what wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing Men, under the most deceitful Colours suggest to them for Sinister Ends, let them guide their Opinions by their own plain and sensible Observation. Let them but fairly and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently compare the present State of all Nations round about them with their own: And then let them refufe, if they can, to bless God and the King, for their inexpressible advantages above all others.</p>
               <p>Whilst all his Majesties Subjects find they may if they will securely injoy Peace, Plenty, Liberty and the best Religion; why should any Torment themselves, or disquiet others with wild imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Fears of future Evils? Which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be so ready a way to bring upon them as their own Fears.</p>
               <p>Henceforth therefore let no vain pretence of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Property once more push them on to the same desperate Designs, wherein when they had formerly success (which they cannot always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise themselves) yet even then it turn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few Years to the Ruine of their own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
               <p>Let no mistaken Zeal of Conscience seduce them again to Disobedience, since the only Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of a True Christian Conscience lead all to Obedience, none to Rebellion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:44330:84"/>
Let them no longer be infatuated by the false Shews and Insinuations of Popularity: Rather let them learn once for all, who is the only true Patriot, what is truly Popular, what not.</p>
               <p>Let them know, That whoever complies with the common Peoples sudden Humours, and changeable Passions, against their solid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; Whoever labours to make the whole Government obnoxious to any single Sect or Party; VVhoever strives to divide the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or City from the Court; VVhoever endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to enlarge disputable Priviledges, to the hazard of known Prerogatives; In fine, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would pervert Liberty into Licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that Man can never be a True Patriot; all That is false Popularity: It is indeed equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Destructive to the People as to the Prince.</p>
               <p>Those Counsels only are and ought to be esteem'd really Popular, which proceed on sure and legal Foundations, to confirm the Monarchy where it is strong, to strengthen and support those parts of it, which by length of time may have been somewhat weaken'd and decay'd. Those Persons only are the True Patriots, and design their Countries Good the best and only sure way, who make it their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to keep the King in a condition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his People. There is no true, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able English Popularity, but true English Loyalty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:44330:85"/>
Thus much his Majesty vouchsafes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise all his Enemies, and discontented Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; though even to them he has done all the Good in this World to oblige them not to be so.</p>
               <p>There is one sort of these, whom the King acknowledges he once thought he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have had just Reason to rank among his Enemies. Those Persons his Majesty means, who after having well approved their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to his Glorious Father in the last Age of Rebellion, have yet since been either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perverted, or have very much stagger'd in their due Obedience and Love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>For them his Majesty declares he would fain still retain his wonted Kindness. And if either private Envy, or a too Presumptuous Value of their old Merits, shall have made them entirely to forget the many vast Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Favours that He, or his Father have so liberally conferr'd on them; or if the late groundless Rumours of Popery, Slavery and Arbitrary Power shall have so far prevail'd, as to sour and corrupt Them also; yet they might remember, that their Generous Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty did once before remain untainted, and bravely stood the Shock amidst the very same Rumours and Slanders, as popularly, but as falsly urg'd then against the Government, as they have been of late. So that either then
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44330:85"/>
they were in the wrong, or are now; and cannot possibly have been both times on the right side.</p>
               <p>Wherefore his Majesty conjures them to look back on the Actions of their former Lives; and to make the Honour gotten by them in their Youth for their Courage and Fidelity to the Crown, first a reproof, then an example to their Old Age. Once for all, let them seriously observe that they are come at last to be unfortunately deluded, not only by many the very same ill Principles, but also by many the very same ill Parties of Men, which they once esteemed it their Glory and Conscience to fight against.</p>
               <p>But as for all who still continue the Kings Faithful Friends and Dutiful Subjects, his Majesty most willingly takes this occasion to speak to them in another style. His Majesty cannot but testifie to all the VVorld the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful sense he retains of their unmoveable steddiness and renew'd Fidelity to him, in these late times of extreme difficulty and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction. He cannot suppress within his own Royal Breast his Joy, to find the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken Principles and Practices of Loyalty to his Blessed Father, still surviving and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in them, and inherited by himself with increase.</p>
               <p>And after the unvaluable Mercy of God to him and his Subjects in his most happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44330:86"/>
his Majesty cannot but esteem This to have been equall'd by none but That; that, in so dangerous a Juncture of Publick Affairs, he has met with so many unfeign'd Testimonies of Love to his Person and Zeal for his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from all Degrees of Men in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And if some have swerv'd from their Duty, yet his Majesties Indignation and Resentments against them are overwhelm'd by the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table remembrance of the far greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Number of those who stood by him in the severest Trials.</p>
               <p>So his Majesty has just reason to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the main Body of the Nobility and Gentry has done: So has the whole sound and honest Part of the Commonalty: So the great Fountains of Knowledge and Civility, the Two Universities: So the wisest, and most Learned in the Laws: So the whole Clergy, and all the Genuine Sons of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> A Church whose Glory it is, to have been never tainted with the least Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish of Disloyalty.</p>
               <p>His Majesty cannot here forbear to let the World know, what entire Satisfaction he has taken in one special Testimony of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Affections; whence through Gods Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Providence the Monarchy has gain'd a most considerable Advantage, by means of this very Conspiracy; And it is, that so great a Number of the Cities and Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44330:86"/>
of this Kingdom, have since so freely resign'd their Local Immunities and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into his Majesties Hands; lest the abuse of any of them should again hereafter prove hazardous to the just Prerogatives of the Crown.</p>
               <p>This his Majesty declares he esteems as the peculiar Honour of his Reign; being such, as none of the most popular of all his late Royal Predecessors could have promis'd to themselves, or hoped for. Wherefore his Majesty thinks himfelf more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily oblig'd to continue, as he has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to begun, to shew the greatest Moderation and Benignity, in the exercise of so great a Trust: Resolving upon this occasion, to convince the highest pretenders to the Commonweal; that as the Crown was the first Original, so it is still the surest Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of all the Peoples Lawful Rights, and Privileges.</p>
               <p>In Conclusion his Majesty makes this solemn Declaration to all his Loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: That as by former and late Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, he has found, next under God, the firmness of his Friends to him has sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Authority and Life; So he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to secure both, by his Constancy to his Friends. Such as was the Old Loyal Party, and as many as have been bred up, and succeeded in their Principles; Whom his Majesty looks on as the great Pillars,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44330:87"/>
and Supporters of his Throne. By them therefore his Majesty declares, he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways stand, and then he is sure by Gods Grace he can never fall.</p>
               <p>His Majesty also here Publickly resolves, that he himself will take care to keep his Ministers and Servants, from the Lowest to the Highest, within the Lawful Bounds of their Duty; But will never suffer them to be cryed down by Noise, and Tumults.</p>
               <p>As to his Dearest and most Loyal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Safety and just Rights, his Majesty assures all the World, he will inviolably Cherish them as his own. And as the Danger in this Hellish Conspiracy was Common to them both, so their Interests and Affections shall be always inseparable. Nor can his Majesty forbear to recommend to the Imitation of all his other Subjects, the profound Respect, entire Resignation, and Obedience, which his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness continues to Practise to his Majesties Person and Government.</p>
               <p>His Majesty expects from his Subjects all just submission to his Laws: And promises them a proportionable Favour and Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. His Majesty lets them all know that the Rewards of the Crown shall be distributed, according as Men deserve of the Crown, and no otherwise. And
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44330:87"/>
as God has given his Majesty the Heart, not to desire to abuse; So he will never, as long as he Lives, part with the just Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives and Powers, with which God alone has intrusted him.</p>
