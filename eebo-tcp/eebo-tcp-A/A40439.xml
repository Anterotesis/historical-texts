         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>1. <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Ortugall,</hi> given by <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the sixth King of
<hi>Castile</hi> (after a signal Victory obtained against
the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> Anno 1089.) in Dowry
with his Daughter <hi>Therasia</hi> to Count <hi>Henry,</hi>
Grand-child to <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> (in
Recompence of his extraordinary (though but
personal) assistance in the Battail, and to have
there so considerable a Strength, where the incursions of the <hi>Moors</hi> were
most frequent and terrible) hath been maintain'd, enlarg'd (at home and
abroad) and recovered, by Courage and Policy not below those Deserts
which got so unusual a Match and Portion for a Stranger.</p>
            <p>2. Count <hi>Henry</hi> took <hi>Viseu</hi> and <hi>Lamego</hi> from the <hi>Moors,</hi> yet left
<hi>Portugall</hi> with Neighbouring Frontiers, for Southward it was bounded
with the River <hi>Mondego,</hi> (infested with the Invasions of the Infidels)
Northward with the River <hi>Minho,</hi> towards the Rising Sun it had the
Province <hi>Beira,</hi> and towards the Setting, on the Sea-side the City <hi>Porto,</hi>
which being the only Port, unpossess't by the <hi>Moors,</hi> and chiefly frequented
by the <hi>French,</hi> seems more reasonably then some other Etymologies, to give
the name to the Kingdome of <hi>Portugall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Alphonsus Henriques,</hi> Son to Count <hi>Henry</hi> (as the fatal greatness
of <hi>Rome</hi> made its first King <hi>Romulus</hi> a Souldier) was not second to
any in Story, in Courage and Action; He defeated <hi>Albucaran</hi> King of
<hi>Badajos,</hi> and took the City, raised the Siege of <hi>Coimbra,</hi> besieged by King
<hi>Eujunius,</hi> with three hundred thousand men: In the year 1139. at the
Battail of <hi>Orique</hi> (where impartial and concurrent Histories count an
hundred <hi>Moors</hi> for every <hi>Christian</hi>) he overcame <hi>Ismarus</hi> and four more
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Kings, on which he was (as some affirm) after the Fight
saluted King by his own Souldiers; from that Action also, the <hi>Virgil</hi> of
<hi>Portugall Luis de Camoens</hi> (in the 53. and 54. Stanzas of his third
<hi>Canto</hi>) derives the bearing of the Arms of the Kingdome, which are
five small shields Azure, in a great shield Argent, left plain by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

Oath <hi>Alphonsus Henriques</hi> took in the year 1152. (before the Bishop

Fight, as was fore-told by Christ, who at the same time commanded him
to take for his Arms what he paid for the Redemption of Man, and what he
was sold for to the Iews, to which the King added for his Crest <hi>Moses</hi>'s

Oath) concerning the Succession, Alienation and Restauration of the
Crown of <hi>Portugall; Bono animo esto, Vinces, vinces, &amp; non vince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,

the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s seising on the Kingdome of <hi>Portugall</hi> after the Death
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardinal (who succeeded the unfortunate Sebastian)
the seventeenth King, and by the happy Restauration of the Royal Family
in King <hi>John</hi> the Fourth of Glorious memory, Father to our most Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Queen <hi>Katherine.</hi> This Record was found engross'd in Parchment
with five Seals annex'd in the Royal Monastery of <hi>Alcobaca,</hi> the Original
was carried to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and is now in the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial;
there remains in <hi>Lisbone</hi> an Authentique Copy, and <hi>Dom
Antonio de Sousa de Macedo</hi> hath Printed it in the second Proeme of
his <hi>Lusitania Liberata,</hi> pag. 96, 97, and 98. This first King took
Saint <hi>Iren</hi> from the <hi>Moors,</hi> and (by the help of the <hi>Northern</hi> Fleet sent
to the Holy Land under the Command of <hi>William</hi> Long-sword) got
from them, after a long and bloody Siege, <hi>Lisbone:</hi> Afterwards <hi>Beja</hi>
and <hi>Evora,</hi> and the greatest part of the Country on the South-side of <hi>Tagus,</hi>
by the <hi>Portuguese</hi> called <hi>Allentejo,</hi> he Died in the year of our Lord
1185. of his Reign 73. and of his Age 91. a King so extraordinary
in his own Person, in the unusual length of his Life and Reign was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the fast Rooting that Monarchy, which was so gloriously to spread
it self, as far as <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> extend.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Alphonsus</hi> was succeeded by his Son <hi>Sanctius</hi> the first, from whom
the Crown continued in the direct Descendency for above two hundred years,
till <hi>John</hi> the first Brother to King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the last of nine Kings,
who in continual Warrs had imployed their Pious and Victorious Arms in
driving the <hi>Moors</hi> out of <hi>Europe,</hi> so long so stoutly did they defend
their Possessions.</p>
            <p>5. King <hi>John</hi> (seeing all clear behind him) did then, Prudently
and in Compliance with that Innate hatred the Crown of <hi>Portugall</hi> had
against the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> pass over to <hi>Africa,</hi> where he took from the <hi>Moors</hi>
the City of <hi>Ceuta,</hi> as Emulous and Troublesome a Neighbour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor
to <hi>Spain,</hi> as <hi>Carthage</hi> was once to <hi>Italy.</hi> After this advantage
on the <hi>Africans,</hi> his third Son the <hi>Infante Dom Henrique</hi> Commander of
the Cavalliers of Christ (an order founded by <hi>Dennis</hi> the sixth King of
<hi>Portugal</hi> against the Infidels, on the Dissolution of that of the Knights
Templers) incited by the obligation of his Office and Family, set upon the
Discovery of the <hi>Western</hi> Coast of <hi>Arabia,</hi> of which, in the expedition
of <hi>Ceuta (cujus pars magna fuit)</hi> and other passages made over
thither, he had got the best Information he could find amongst the <hi>Moors;</hi>
He began his design <hi>Anno</hi> 1420. by sending forth every year two or
<pb facs="tcp:57115:7"/>
three Ships, which were to pass <hi>Cape Non,</hi> the furthest of the <hi>Spanish</hi>
discoveries, and by them so named, like <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars, from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of passing further; In all the Voyages of twelve years they came but
to the Cape <hi>Bojador,</hi> (so named from its Launching out) which no man
had the boldness to double, because finding that Cape to shoot out <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
about forty Leagues further then the rest of the Coast, and at the
beginning of the Cape a Bank of Sands to run the same way, the unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
and raw Pilots (used then to Sail by the Shore) durst not stand
off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ix Leagues (which had avoided the Flats) and go so far <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
The <hi>Infante</hi> undaunted by the consideration of expence or danger,
continually set out Fleets and gave Orders to the most skilfull and stout
Commanders to adventure the passing that then so formidable Cape; In
these Voyages <hi>Porto Sancto</hi> was, after a great Storm, recovered and found
out, (and so named from the Preservation), afterwards the Island <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deira,</hi>
so called from the thick Woods upon it; with Resolute and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
perseverance, Vast and Prodigious expence, unheard of Suffering
and Danger, he at last past the Cape, and in forty three years carried on
his Discoveries from Cape <hi>Non</hi> in twenty eight degrees and an half, of
<hi>Northern</hi> Latitude to Cape <hi>Sierra Lione</hi> in 7 3/4. of the same Latitude,
which makes on the Shore 430. Leagues. In the Sea, besides those already
mentioned, were found out in his time the <hi>Canary</hi> Islands, and those of
<hi>Capoverde;</hi> He laid the foundation of that great Design, not thought of
by any of the Antients, but <hi>Semiramis, Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great, and till now, above the narrow Souls of so many succeeding Ages;
the <hi>13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of November</hi> in the year 1463. was the Day of his glorious
Memory.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the fifth, Grand-child to <hi>John</hi> the first by his Son King
<hi>Edward,</hi> (who Reigned but five years) set to Farm at a certain Rate
the Trade of <hi>Guinney</hi> for five years to <hi>Fermon Gomes,</hi> on condition,
that beginning from the Cape <hi>Sierra Lione</hi> he should every year discover
one hundred Leagues on the Coast; In <hi>January</hi> 1471. he first came to
the place in <hi>Guinney;</hi> by him called (and yet of the same name) the
Mine, and there began to truck for Gold; His discoveries fell not short
of his agreement, for they reached to Cape Saint <hi>Katherine</hi> (so call'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
first seen on her Day) which lies in 2 and 1/2. of <hi>Southern</hi> Latitude.
From this most famous discovery of the Gold Coast he had (according to
the first rule of Sirnames) by Patent from the King given him that of
<hi>Da Mina,</hi> and for his Arms in a field Argent three <hi>Moors</hi> heads
with Gold Rings in their Ears and Nostrils, and Chains of the same about
their Necks. In this King's time were discovered in the Sea the Islands
of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> of the Prince, and of <hi>Anno Bon;</hi> He went <hi>Anno</hi>
1458. in Person with a Fleet of 220. Ships, and about 25000. Men,
and took <hi>Alcacer Leguer</hi> from the <hi>Moors;</hi> In a second expedition got
<hi>Anafe,</hi> in a third <hi>Arzilla</hi> and <hi>Tangier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. King <hi>John</hi> the Second took the Title of Lord of <hi>Guinney,</hi> and
Built on the Gold Coast the Fortress call'd Saint <hi>George</hi> of the Mine,
<pb facs="tcp:57115:7"/>
thereby to take Possession of the past and intended Discoveries, and to lay
the first Stone of a Church for the Conversion of the <hi>Pagans. Diogo Cam</hi>
by his Commission came in the year 1484. to the Kingdome and River of
<hi>Congo,</hi> where (according to his Orders to raise Pillars of Stone (in
stead of Woodden Crosses used before) in the most Eminent places of his
Discoveries, fixing to them an Escutcheon Royal, and about it an Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Portuguese,</hi> declaring the King, the Time and Person
employed in the Discovery) He set up a Pillar on the South-side of the
River, (how much more Glorious then the Imaginary ones of <hi>Hercules</hi>)
which was therefore call'd <hi>Rio do Padraon,</hi> (i. e.) the River of the
Pillar; the Discovery of the Kingdome of <hi>Congo</hi> was so considerable, as
<hi>Diogo Cam</hi> returned with the news to the King, who in a little time fitted
him out again; in this Voyage he went 200. Leagues beyond <hi>Congo,</hi>
and planted two Pillars, one called Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> in 13. degrees of
<hi>Southern</hi> Latitude, another which named the place <hi>Capo do Padraon,</hi>
in 22. degrees of the same Latitude. About this time was discovered by
<hi>Fernaon Do Po</hi> the Island yet called by his Name, and the Kingdome
of <hi>Benim,</hi> whence the first <hi>Guinney</hi> Pepper came into <hi>Christendome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1486. there came into <hi>Portugall</hi> an Ambassadour from
the King of <hi>Penim,</hi> to desire some Priests to instruct that Kingdome in
the Catholique Religion, this Embassadour told King <hi>John,</hi> that twenty
Moneths Iourney (according to the slow Travelling of their <hi>Caravans</hi>)
<hi>Eastward</hi> of their Country was a Prince call'd <hi>Organé,</hi> who amongst the
<hi>Pagan</hi> Princes of that Coast was esteemed as the Pope is in <hi>Europe,</hi> by
whom (according to antient Custom) the Kings of <hi>Benim</hi> were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in their Succession to the Crown, who instead of a Scepter and a
Crown, sent them a Staff, and to wear on their Head a Cover of Copper,
like an Helmet, and a Cross to wear about their Neck; The King compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this Relation with what some of his Friars had heard at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
from the <hi>Abissines,</hi> of their Prince's being a <hi>Christian,</hi> and his Kingdome
<hi>Southward</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon consulting with <hi>Ptolomies</hi> Mapps, and his own
Discoveries, and the distance <hi>Eastward,</hi> concluded <hi>Ogané</hi> to be the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
John</hi> then so much talkt off, that by his means he might get into the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and that by his Fleets following the Coast they might arrive at
<hi>Ptolomies Prasum Promontorium,</hi> now <hi>Mozambique.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. This Story heightning his hopes and desires of getting to the <hi>Indies,</hi>
he sent <hi>May</hi> 1487. over Land <hi>Pero de Couilhaan</hi> to endeavour that
way to come to <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Alphonso de Paiva</hi> with Letters to <hi>Presbyter
John;</hi> the first going from Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> in the Company of some <hi>Moors</hi>
to <hi>Adem,</hi> (in the Streights mouth of the Red-Sea) thence cross'd over
to the Coast of <hi>India,</hi> and was at <hi>Cananor, Calicut</hi> and <hi>Goa;</hi> at his
return to <hi>Cairo,</hi> finding his Companion Dead, and meeting with fresh
desires of the King that he should find out <hi>Presbyter John,</hi> he went again
to the Red-Sea, and from thence got to the Court of <hi>Presbyter John,</hi>
where the welcome Ceremony of his Reception was great, but his Return was
(according to Custom there to retain Strangers) out of hope. The prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb facs="tcp:57115:8"/>
of the Discoveries on the Coasts was continued by sending out a Fleet,
in 1486. under the Command of <hi>Bartholomew Diaz,</hi> he placed his
first Pillar in the height of 24. degrees <hi>Southward,</hi> in a place then named
<hi>Serra Parda,</hi> 120. Leagues beyond the last of <hi>Diego Cam's,</hi> pursuing
their Voyage they came to <hi>Angra das Vottas,</hi> which lies in 29. After
five days stay here putting to Sea again, bad weather kept them 13. days
with their Sails half-Mast high; when the Storm ceas'd, concluding the
Coast according to former Observation to run from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> they
stood in for the Land with an <hi>Easterly</hi> course, but being some days without
making it they went <hi>Northward,</hi> which brought them to <hi>Angra dos Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieras,</hi>
(<hi>North</hi> of the Cape) not having here any Intelligence for
want of an Interpreter, and the fearfull <hi>Moors</hi> leaving the Shore at the
sight of so unusual men, returning to Sea with the same course, they came
to an Island in 33 1/4. <hi>Southward,</hi> where they planted a Pillar call'd the
Cross, which also gave the name to the Island. Here the Mariners weary
and fearfull of the great Seas they found, began to complain and desire not
to be put to tempt Fortune further, but to return, having found a thing
more considerable then any of the former Discoveries, which was, That
the Land being now observed to run <hi>Northward,</hi> there must be in their
Stern some great Cape which they ought to strive to discover: The Counsel
of the Chief Officers of the Fleet rose in this Resolution, hardly granting
<hi>Bartholomew Diaz</hi>'s earnest request, to hold the same Course for two or
three days, and then finding no encouragement to proceed, to Tack about;
at the end of the Limited time, they came to a River 25. Leagues <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
of the Island of <hi>Cryz,</hi> in 32 2/3. call'd <hi>Rio do Infante, John
Infante</hi> Commander of a Ship being the first who went on Shore. Hence,
the Mariners renewing their Complaints, they returned and came in sight
of that so famous Cape, hid for so many Ages, which now did not only Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it self, but a new World; <hi>Bartholomew Diaz</hi> from the Storm and
Dangers he met with in doubling it, call'd it <hi>Cabo Tormentoso,</hi> but the
King at the return of the Fleet gave it the more Illustrious name of <hi>Bona
Esperanza;</hi> They returned <hi>December</hi> 1487. having in sixteen
Moneths seventeen Days discovered 350. Leagues on the Coast. In this
King's time was the <hi>Astrolabe</hi> found out by two of his Physicians, (to
whose thoughts he had recommended the Improvement of <hi>Navigation</hi>)
and one <hi>Martim</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> Scholer to the Great <hi>Regiomontanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. King <hi>John</hi> Dying without Lawfull Issue, the Kingdome came to
<hi>Emanuel</hi> Son to the <hi>Infante Dom Ferdinand,</hi> Brother to <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the
Fifth, This was that great Fortunate and only <hi>Emanuel</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi>
so call'd not only from being Born on <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Day, 1469. but
from his Mothers being delivered (after a sharp and dangerous Labour)
as the Procession came before her Palace;<note n="*" place="margin">On which 'twas said, If at Christ's Birth the Angels, at <hi>Emanuels,</hi> Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self assisted.</note> He was Born, with Arms
so long, as standing upright, and holding them down, they reach't to
his Knees, on which the Astrologers concluded his coming to the Crown,
and the extent of his Dominions, according to their <hi>Axiome, Brachia
usque ad genua extenta imperare desiderant, &amp; aliquando imperant.</hi>
Some pretend without any force to the words to apply to him the <hi>Sybilla
<pb facs="tcp:57115:8"/>
Cumea</hi>'s Prophecie in <hi>Virgils</hi> fourth <hi>Eglogue;</hi> He began to Reign at
26. years Old 1495. and Fir'd with the high design of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
to Sail through the Ocean to the <hi>Indies,</hi> he the next year concluded
to send the great <hi>Vasco do Gama</hi> to try for them; This year was spent
in Councils and Preparations, and in the following 1497. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>July,</hi> an unseasonable time, (but that great Actions expect not
Opportunities) the Fleet consisting of three Ships and a Victualler, (after
a solemn Procession of Prayers and Tears and general Benediction) set
Sail, the first Land they came at was (after five Moneths) the Bay of
Saint <hi>Helena</hi> lying in 32. degrees <hi>Southward;</hi> On the <hi>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
they doubled the Cape of <hi>Good Hope;</hi> On <hi>Christmas</hi> day they
pass'd by the <hi>Costa do Natal,</hi> not arrived at before, and so call'd, from
the time they came to it; On <hi>Twelfth</hi> day they entred into a great River,
therefore call'd <hi>Rio dos Reys;</hi> following on their Voyage they came to
another great River 50. Leagues <hi>Northward</hi> of Sofala, where the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
freely and friendly Convers'd with the Fleet, furnish'd them with
fresh Provisions, and told them that <hi>Eastward</hi> there were men of their
Colour who Sail'd in such Ships, whom they often saw pass by that Coast.
On which <hi>Vasca do Gama</hi> call'd the place <hi>Rio dos bons Sinaes,</hi> and set
up a Pillar there call'd Saint <hi>Raphael,</hi> with this good news and security
(the best Warrant they ever had of their Hope) they came to <hi>Mocambique,</hi>
where they were at first well received by the <hi>Xeque,</hi> after assaulted by
his Permission, and betray'd by his Pilot; <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> they came to
<hi>Mombaza,</hi> thence went for <hi>Melinde,</hi> where they made Peace with that
King, and had from him a Pilot who carried them in 22. days cross
that great Gulf of 700. Leagues, which is betwixt this Coast of <hi>Africa</hi>
and that of <hi>Malabar;</hi> the first place he arrived at was <hi>Calecut,</hi> the
design of his Voyage and end of his Instructions, having particular Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and an Embassage for the <hi>Samorin</hi> (i. e.) Emperour, who (as
<hi>Portugall</hi> was inform'd) was the greatest Prince and Lord of all the
Spices of those Parts; <hi>Vasco da Gama</hi> had twice Audience of the
<hi>Samorim,</hi> setled the Trade with him, and having plac'd five Pillars in
his peculiar discovery of 1200. Leagues from <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East,</hi> returned
safe to <hi>Lisbone, 23 August</hi> 1499.</p>
            <p>10. The news <hi>Vasco da Gama</hi> brought from the <hi>Indies</hi> of the hopes
to recompence so many pass'd difficulties, by the propagation of the Gospel,
and the Spices and Iewels of the <hi>East,</hi> encouraged the King to set out in
the year 1500. a Fleet of thirteen Ships, under the Command <hi>Pedral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez
Cabrall,</hi> who meeting with a Storm at <hi>Capo Verde</hi> went out to
Sea, to make sure of doubling the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> and after a
Moneths Voyage, came first to the other great Continent of <hi>America,</hi>
where (from the solemn Planting of a Cross) he named his new discovery
<hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> but the common discourse of Interest, prevailing against
Devotion, the profit of the Wood brought from thence call'd it <hi>Brasilia.
Pedralvarez</hi> setting out from <hi>Porto Seguro,</hi> (so call'd by him from the
goodness of it) lost by foul Weather four of his Ships, in that great Ocean
between <hi>Brazil</hi> and the Cape, and after the extremities of a bad Voyage,
<pb facs="tcp:57115:9"/>
came but with six torn Ships to <hi>Sofala,</hi> thence Sailing along the Coast got
to <hi>Quiloa</hi> and <hi>Melinde,</hi> where he took two Pilots, with whom he cross'd
over for <hi>India,</hi> deliver'd his Letters to the <hi>Samorim,</hi> Laded two Ships
there, the rest in <hi>Cochim</hi> and <hi>Cananor,</hi> (where he began Factories)
and from those two places brought Embassadours to settle a Peace and Trade,
arriving safely with them in <hi>Portugall.</hi> After so great Discoveries, the
probability of a Trade, and a Resolution to set out every year a Fleet for the
Discovery and Commerce of <hi>India,</hi> King <hi>Emanuel</hi> enlarged the Title of
the Crown, by Styling himself Lord of the Navigation, Conquest and
Commerce of <hi>Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia</hi> and <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. In the year 1502. this now so great a King, knowing Protection
not to be less glorious then Conquest, made <hi>Vasco da Gama</hi> Admiral of
all the Seas in the <hi>East,</hi> and sent him with twenty Sail to the <hi>Indies,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
five were as a setled Fleet to continue there, to protect the new Factories,
and to go some Moneths in the year to the Mouth of the Red-Sea to hinder
the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Mecca</hi> from coming out, who were the fiercest Enemies the
<hi>Portuguese</hi> had, and who most Laboured to hinder their progress in
<hi>India;</hi> for these getting into their hands the Trade of Spices, the <hi>Moors</hi>
who before furnished <hi>Christendome,</hi> by the way of <hi>Cairo</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
fore-saw the ill consequence of their loss. This Voyage made Tributary
the King of <hi>Quiloa,</hi> placed new Factories, revenged Injuries, protected
Allies, and made the <hi>Portuguese</hi> so famous in the <hi>East,</hi> as their coming
thither was not in a few Kingdoms and Provinces taken for the <hi>Aera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. The Acquisitions and Trade arrived to that height, as in the
year 1505. <hi>Dom Francisco d' Almeyda,</hi> was sent thither with the
Title of Vice-Roy, the first so eminent Title given in these Parts; with him
went divers Gentlemen to serve there, with the Obligation then begun and
always continued to stay there three years; in his Voyage he took <hi>Quiloa,</hi>
built a Fortress, and left a Commander there, burnt <hi>Mombaza,</hi> built
also a Fortress in <hi>Anchediva,</hi> he sent his Son <hi>Dom Lorenzo</hi> to find out
the Island <hi>Zeilan,</hi> and the <hi>Maldives,</hi> which he performed, and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the <hi>Moors,</hi> who after the <hi>Portuguese</hi> coming into <hi>India,</hi> and keeping
a Fleet on the Coast of <hi>Malabar,</hi> carried the Spices laded at <hi>Symatra,</hi> a
new way they had found out, <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Zeilan,</hi> and through the Islands,
whence to avoid the Coast of <hi>India</hi> they cross'd over the Gulf, till they came
to the Mouth of the Red-Sea, or <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf: <hi>Dom Lorenzo</hi> was
afterwards Kill'd in a Sea-Fight, which the Vice-Roy's Vengeance made
dear to the Infidels.</p>
            <p>13. On <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> in the year 1506. <hi>Tristaond' Acunha,</hi> parted
from <hi>Lisbone</hi> with a Fleet of fourteen Sail, and on it thirteen hundred
Souldiers, after a great Mortality caus'd by a Plague which hapned among
the men, the bad Air was observed to cease, and the Sick and Infirm to
recover in their crossing the Line; in the Voyage they made Cape Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> in <hi>Brazil,</hi> and crossing the great Ocean before they came to the
Cape, discovered the Island then named, and yet called <hi>Tristaon d'
<pb facs="tcp:57115:9"/>
Acuna;</hi> One of the Ships, parted from the rest by a Storm, first put in at
a Port of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> call'd <hi>Matatana,</hi> where he got so good Information
of the place, as the News put <hi>Tristaon</hi> on the Discovery, which he perfected,
and going afterwards for the <hi>Indies,</hi> in his way took from the <hi>Moors</hi> a
Fortress in <hi>Socotora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. After the business of <hi>Socotora,</hi> the great <hi>Alphonso d' Albo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi>
(who came with the Fleet from <hi>Lisbone</hi>) with seven of the
Ships designed to go along the Coast of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and after so many Ages
to revenge on the <hi>Arabs</hi> their Incursions and Possessions on the Continent
of <hi>Spain;</hi> the first place he arrived at in the Kingdome of <hi>Ormus</hi> was
the City <hi>Calayate,</hi> where he accepted of their Friendship, and forc'd four
more to take his upon his own Terms, went on persuing his Victories, and
sending fear (his <hi>Harbinger</hi>) before him, till he came to <hi>Ormus,</hi> where
he made Peace with the King, upon condition to turn Tributary to the King
of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and permit him to Build a Fortress on the Island; By the
great Fleet which parted 1509. the Vice-Roy received orders to return,
and <hi>Alboquerque</hi> was possess'd of the Government, which he Eternis'd by
taking the Cities of <hi>Calicut</hi> (the greatest and most powerfull Enemy the
<hi>Portuguese</hi> had in <hi>India</hi>) and <hi>Goa,</hi> seated in the heart of <hi>India,</hi> (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
judiciously made the Residence of the Vice-Roys and Governours)
went in Person to <hi>Sumatra,</hi> and possess'd himself of <hi>Malaca,</hi> so famous
among the Antients for its Scituation in the <hi>Aurea Chersonesus,</hi> and
then the great Mart of all the <hi>Eastern</hi> Merchants; In the time he spent
here, he received Embassies and Offers of Friendship from the Kings of
<hi>Campar</hi> and <hi>Java,</hi> and from the King of <hi>Siam</hi> upon the Continent, sent an
Embassadour to the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and Ships to discover the Spice Islands
of the <hi>Maluccoes</hi> and <hi>Banda;</hi> He made the first expedition into the
Red-Sea, and entred that Streight, Coasting <hi>Arabia</hi> till he came to the
Island of <hi>Ceibam,</hi> in the middle of that Gulf, being returned from setling
<hi>Ormus,</hi> he Died full of Glory and Deserts on Ship-board, at the Barr of
<hi>Goa,</hi> in the year 1515. and his own Climaterical.</p>
            <p>15. The same year King <hi>Emanuel</hi> designing an honourable Repose,
for <hi>Alboquerque</hi> after so much Sweat and Toyl in Warr and Victory, had
sent Governour to the <hi>Indies Lopo Soarez d' Albergaria</hi> with a Fleet
of thirteen Ships, and Instructions to make a Fortress upon the Island of
<hi>Zeilan,</hi> whence according to his Intelligence came all the Cynamon of those
parts. At his first coming to the Island in 1518. the King of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo,</hi>
on the noise of the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Arms and Iustice, readily consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but altered by the Iealousie and Interest of the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Calicut</hi>
and <hi>Malabar,</hi> was afterwards forced to yield a Fortress, and become Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary;
In his Government <hi>Perez d' Andrade</hi> with four Ships went to
discover the Gulf of <hi>Bangala,</hi> and the Coast of <hi>China;</hi> He was suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
at the end of three years, by <hi>Diogo Lopez de Sequeira,</hi> who
made a Voyage to the Red-Sea, according to his Instructions from the King,
to find out the Coast of <hi>Presbyter John,</hi> he came to the Island <hi>Macua,</hi>
Inhabited by Christian <hi>Moors,</hi> and to <hi>Arquico</hi> a Fort of <hi>Presbyter

            <p>16. King <hi>Emanuel</hi> Died in <hi>December</hi> 1521. after a glorious
Reign of 26. years. The first sent to the <hi>Indies</hi> by his Son King <hi>John</hi>
the Third, was he who discovered them, <hi>Vasco da Gama</hi> made <hi>Conde
da Vidigueira,</hi> he went with the second Title of Vice-Roy, which was not
given of course to those who went to Govern <hi>India,</hi> but (as the <hi>Romans</hi>

of the Third Vice-Roy, as our <hi>Dom John de Castro</hi> was made the

the second so famous Siege of <hi>Dio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. <hi>Dio</hi> famous for twice Baffling the Power and Policy of the <hi>East,</hi>

               </gap>, which his Flatterers gave him as the
Son of <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> others (without Searching into the reason of the
Name) give it a more Ignoble beginning, by saying it was only anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
Inhabited by Fisher-men, but afterward, like <hi>Venice</hi> grew great, rich,
and formidable; It was a constant part of King <hi>Emanuel</hi>'s Instructions
to those who serv'd him in the <hi>Indies,</hi> (knowing a Fortress here would be
to <hi>India</hi> such a Curb as <hi>Argos</hi> in the hands of Strangers was once to
<hi>Greece</hi>) to try always to get footing in this place. It was accordingly
often (but in vain) attempted by all the ways force or stratagem could
suggest, but was only that, the Fortune and Grandeur of so great a King
could not atchieve; <hi>Dom John</hi> the Third, not so Covetous of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
as Virtues and Victories of his Father, commanded the Governours
not to lay aside the design, without engaging for it in whatsoever expence
or difficulty, who were all so blindly obedient as to lye with great Fleets
before it, observing the places of advantage, sometimes falling on by open
Force, sometime by Design, yet all unsuccessfull; On which advice the
King ordered the Warr to be carried on in other places of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> that
by desolating his Cities, annoying his Ports, and obstructing the Trade,
that King might be forc'd to purchase his quiet by granting him a Fortress
there; The Execution of the <hi>Portuguese</hi>'s Arms, and Crys of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
brought him to seek Peace by giving, first the City <hi>Bacam,</hi> with its
Iurisdiction and Revenues to the Governour; afterwards being press'd by
so terrible an Enemy as the <hi>Mogul,</hi> and the Rebellion of his own Subjects,
he bought Protection and Assistance from the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> by giving them
leave to choose a place there, to Build a Fortress on, which <hi>Martim Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso

de Sofa</hi> Admiral of the Seas of <hi>India,</hi> imployed by the Governour
to compleat the Treaty, placed on the point which commands the Haven;
This was in the year 1535. It was not long before the King of <hi>Cambaia</hi>
perceived the <hi>Portuguese</hi> by their possession here to have their Feet upon
his Neck, and all the <hi>East</hi> to complain of the interruption of their Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
and the loss of their Trade and Commerce to <hi>Mecca,</hi> upon which
the King listned greedily to <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi>'s perswasion of Besieging the
place, on the security of being assisted, by a great Fleet from the <hi>Turk,</hi> who
design'd to drive the <hi>Portuguese</hi> out of <hi>India.</hi> This Siege began (<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio
da Silvera</hi> being Governour of <hi>Dio) July</hi> 1538. the first
Army which came against the place consisting of six thousand Horse, and
thirteen thousand Foot, under the Command of <hi>Alucan,</hi> and <hi>Coge-Sofar;</hi>
and in <hi>September, Solomon Bashaw</hi> Admiral of the Turks came to
their Relief, with a Fleet of seventy six Vessels, full of Choise men, and a
suitable preparation of all other necessaries. There was not wanting by Sea
or Land, the personal and constant gallantry of Assaults, the subtilty of
Stratagem, and uninterrupted Battery of great Guns, against a few men
taken unprovided; yet did the Enemy raise the Siege himself, at the end of
<hi>October,</hi> and the Vice-Roy <hi>Dom Garcia de Noronha</hi> found him gone
when he came to their Relief with one hundred and sixty Sail.</p>
            <p>17. The subjection all <hi>India</hi> was in, under the Fortress of <hi>Dio;</hi> the
old Animosities for the first Baffle received at that place, and <hi>Sultan Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed</hi>'s
revenge for the Death of his Father <hi>Badur,</hi> kill'd by the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guese,</hi>
begot the second Siege of <hi>Dio</hi> 1546. the chief Story of our
History, which, (if not much prejudiced by a lessening Translation) may
probably appear one of the greatest Actions on Record. Here Envy cannot
fasten that, with which she so disparagingly blasted <hi>Alexanders</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and Conquests in <hi>Asia,</hi> That he had to do with unarm'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polisht
Men, master'd to his hand by Vice and Luxury. Courage, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
Design and Arms were here in that height, as they seem'd not to be
newly learn'd in the <hi>East,</hi> and must have prevailed against any one but a
<hi>Dom John de Castro,</hi> one so singular in all Vertues as he might Cope
with any of the antient <hi>Heroes,</hi> and challenge a place in the Kalendar of
Saints, whose constant Carriage and Influence over all <hi>India,</hi> is (besides
the universal consent of History) a strong argument for some successes,
which might be otherwise startled at as improbable; if any can be so, to
that Magnanimous and Hereditary preseverance in difficulties, which we
have shew'd to be Entaild for above an Age upon the <hi>Portuguese.</hi> To

Siege of nine Moneths, re-inforc'd with one hundred thousand Foot, and
45000. Horse, managed with all the horrour, resoluteness, and policy of
Warr, and the Counsel of the most Prudent about him, could not so defend
him against the subtle perswasions of his admiring Flatterers, as to stop his
fatal Voyage into <hi>Africa,</hi> Anno 1578. where after a hard March in the

<hi>Sebastian,</hi> was on his Death by the <hi>Civillians, Nemine contradicente,</hi>
asserted King, and accordingly receiv'd by the Kingdome; his old Age,
(which allow'd him but the Reign of one Year and five Moneths) and the
Character of his Spiritual orders, (beautified in him by the chast and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
Austerity of a Prince) obliged him to endeavour to settle the
Succession, by appointing a meeting of the States at <hi>Almeirim,</hi> there to
hear the pretensions of those five Rivals, who Courted the Crown; The
Competitors were,</p>

               <hi>Antonio, Prior</hi> of <hi>Crato,</hi> natural Son to the Infante <hi>Dom Lewis,</hi>

by the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> fled to <hi>Porto,</hi> thence got into <hi>France,</hi> and in the

unanimously acknowledge him if he got Footing there) the Fleet design'd
for the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> under the Command of Captain <hi>Drake,</hi> appeared
in his Favour, but the <hi>Portuguese</hi> answered not his expectation; His only

            <p>20. The Restauration of King <hi>John</hi> the Fourth, to the Kingdome and
Crown of <hi>Portugall,</hi> Anno 1640. is eminently observable; That the
Possession of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for threescore years, had not made the
<hi>Portuguese</hi> loose their Courage, or Hopes to effect their desires; That the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> should make the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> (whose pretences to the
Crown and affections of the People he very well knew) Grand-master of
the Artillary, who in dischage of his trust seemed to refuse the offer of
the Crown; That a secret intrusted with six hundred should not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry;
That the design should be perfected with only the Death of the
Secretary: And that its influence should be so general and powerfull, as
the <hi>Castillians</hi> were every where, and almost at the same time laid aside
particularly in <hi>Brazil,</hi> where they were totally extirpated; And where
afterwards the States of <hi>Holland</hi> found this policy of the <hi>Portuguese,</hi>
seconded by the Courage of their Ancestors, in taking the <hi>Reciffe</hi> in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambuck,</hi>
Ianuary 1654. a place the States with a Fleet of fifty Ships
had taken from the <hi>Spaniard</hi> 1630. of such consequence, That whilst
the Crowns were united in one, the Recovery of it, was the great Debate of
the Councils, attempted by the Admiral <hi>Dom Antonio de Oquendo,</hi>
1631. Afterwards for many years, by the greatest Preparations and most
eminent Persons of both Kingdomes; yet the complicated Strength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Fortifications (whom their Experience had made
the great Masters of that Art) made it impregnable against all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taques.
The taking in of this by the <hi>Portuguese</hi> alone, when a King of
their own made them act like and for themselves, and the keeping of it
against the Force and Fleet of Count <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Nassau,</hi> may at the end
of a long Preface excuse the Recital of many more performances of the
<hi>Portuguese,</hi> (after their Restauration) Notorious for the Wisdome of the
Contrivance and Gallantry of the Execution.</p>

Ancestors. He spent his first Years in that Learning and
Vertue, his Age was then capable of; being so naturally
inclin'd to Learning, that he needed not be forc'd,
but only put in the way. <hi>Dom Iohn,</hi> not being the Heir
of his House, was intended for Study; Learning being
always the second Birth-right amongst the best Houses
of this Kingdome. <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> obey'd, not having then
Liberty to refuse, or a School to take another Lesson

Arms by Destiny, he look'd upon the glory of the
Schools as small, finding himself intended for the Warrs,
both by his own Inclination, and by his fore-fathers
Example.</p>
            <p>3. The repute of <hi>Dom Edward Menezes,</hi> Governour
of <hi>Tangiers,</hi> was at that time great, whose Name the

Courage equal to his Blood, and above his Years, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving

the Fleet came to Anchor in the Port of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> and

the Infante <hi>Dom Lewis</hi> with all his weighty Resolutions,

(though against my Custom) more largely relate, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it higher, not to Disjoynt the History. That fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Pirat <hi>Haradin Barba-Rossa,</hi> found himself almost
quite broken with the loss of <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Goleta,</hi> and
more after the loss of his Galleys, losing by Land the
power of a Tyrant, and by the Sea the strength of a Pirat;
yet was not this Arch Enemy so much shaken, but that
<hi>Italy</hi> many years after sighed under his Lash; He had
laid up in diverse places the best part of his Booty, as
an other plank to save himself upon; this he presented
to <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> of Valew enough, to
efface, or excuse, the disgrace of his Fleet, and Flight at
<hi>Tunis;</hi> which was yet fresh in <hi>Solymans</hi> grief, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
withall represented what he could do against
the <hi>Christians,</hi> that taking the Sea at first with only
two Galliots ill fitted out, his Valour and Success had
made him so formidable and powerfull, that with their
own spoils he entertain'd them with a sharp Warr, that
the Jaols of <hi>Africa</hi> would not hold the Slaves; that
in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> in all <hi>Apulia,</hi> and the <hi>Terra
de Lavoro,</hi> he had committed such Out-rages, that
neither their Blood, or Tears were yet dry; that the
Galleys of <hi>Sicily</hi> out of fear rotted at Anchor; That,
that <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> (so much sought to by the Princes of
Europe) could not but confess how oft he was forc'd
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57115:19"/>
to Row for't, to escape <hi>Barba-Rossa,</hi> that he fear'd not
to Cite his Enemies witnesses of his Actions; that
the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> (Nettled with so many Losses,
seeing <hi>Barba-Rossa</hi> only over-cast his Victories) did
more like the impatient Man, than the Souldier, joyn
all the Forces of <hi>Germany, Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi>
to Destroy him, rashly exposing the best of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
to the chance of his either losing or getting the
Day, and though his Old Fortune left him not, he only
got the credit of the Battail without any pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it, (for
Dispossessing one Enemy of <hi>Tunis,</hi> investing an other
in't) neither was the Victory so entire that it Cost him
not Ships and Men, and with the expence of so great
a force he had exhausted the Exchequer of <hi>Spain;</hi> that
now was the true time to ruine <hi>Christendome,</hi> weakned
with a great Warr, and grown careless with a seeming
Victory; that in the Streight of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> was the
famous City of <hi>Ceita,</hi> (the Port whence heretofore
the <hi>Africans</hi> with Victorious Arms entred on their
Conquest of <hi>Spain</hi>) which the <hi>Portuguese</hi> held with
weak Walls, and a poor Garrison, more bent upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing
their Neighbours, than securing themselves from
'em, because heightned with their prosperity in the
<hi>East,</hi> they slighted things at home, like Rivers that are
largest at their greatest distance from their Spring-head;
that if the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Majesty were incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to bring under his Dominion that so considerable
a part of <hi>Europe,</hi> He would underatake with a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
number of Galleys to possess him of <hi>Ceita;</hi> by
which those who were farthest <hi>West</hi> should Live in
awe of his Empire. Thus discourst the <hi>Corsaire,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
with an others force to recover the Credit and
Station from which he was fall'n. And as in Princes
Courts, great Designs more than possible are listned to,
and <hi>Barba-Rossa</hi>'s Experience and Valour had so good
security, proud and warlick <hi>Solyman</hi> began to give ear
to a defign of so great Importance, and so well laid for
the peace and prosperity of his Empire: He willingly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57115:19"/>
heard <hi>Barba-Rossa</hi> perswading him that the Benefit of
this Action would out-weigh the Difficulty; The
<hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> too kindled the <hi>Turks</hi> indignation,
who Lamented they could not breath quietly in peace
with us, some bewailing their lost Liberty, others the
Effronts of their Prophet in their ruind <hi>Mosques;</hi> for the
remedy of these grievances, they strive to engage
the <hi>Turk</hi> upon his Zeal, and Greatness, which Motives
concerning Religion, and Majesty, might veil over
the Ambition, and justifie the Action.</p>
            <p>24. <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperour Sollicitous what <hi>Barba-Rossa</hi>
did in <hi>Constantinople,</hi>

about the invasion of <hi>Spain,</hi> and though the first
Blow was aim'd at <hi>Ceita,</hi> yet (Victory never stopping
where it begins) and unwilling to be crush'd in our

and the doubling those Garrisons which were in the
Ports of the <hi>Streights</hi> mouth, writing to the King <hi>Don

might joyntly provide for the resisting the common

            <p>25. The news coming to <hi>Portugall,</hi> the King imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
fell upon Fortifying <hi>Ceita,</hi> whose Defence was
only after the rate of those Times; and we being
Conquerours in <hi>Africa,</hi> kept our Garrisons by our

with his at <hi>Cales,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Don Alvaro

all the weight of the Warr might not lye upon our

            <p>26. The King was busie in finding out one to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

in our Kingdome, whom the Experience and Dangers
of our Conquests had made Souldiers, yet <hi>Dom Iohn
de Castro</hi>'s Name made it self room amongst the first;
t'was his Pride neither to ask or to deny any Service
for his Country: We know that though King <hi>Iohn</hi>
lov'd his Valour, he car'd not for his Right, so that
what he got by one Virtue, he lost by an other; and
we observ'd not that he had any Place or Preferment

was ready to Sail, a great part of the Nobility of the

when on a sudden <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi> was nam'd to be
the Man, to the general satisfaction even of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors.</p>
            <p>27. The King sent for <hi>Dom Iohn,</hi> acquainting him
with the News from the Emperour, and with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of the <hi>Turk,</hi> expressing to him with what Envy
he sent him upon so Honourable an Employment; but
since it was the Royal Prison of Kings, to conferr Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and not to be in a condition to deserve it; He

where (when the Complements were ended) he
gave him an account of what he heard of the Enemy,
and that according to Intelligence, his first Onset
would be upon <hi>Ceita;</hi> they then fell upon't, that the

upon both their Honours to Fight the Enemy,<note place="margin">They dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about the Battail.</note> though
he should be much stronger; that we Fought in our own

battered Ships would have a refuge at hand; that
though the <hi>Turks</hi> should get the Victory, they would
be so broken, as not to be able to set upon any place
in the <hi>Streight,</hi> which, by Fighting, let the success be
what it would, they should secure; Besides, the Orders
they had under Seal to find out the Enemy, could not
be understood otherwise with safety to their Honour
and Obedience. Having taken this so precise and bold
Resolution, the Souldiers were all on Fire, and the

and disposing for so great an Affair; when on a

               <note place="margin">The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> General changeth his mind.</note> that new accidents must

that 'twas much against his humour to desist

               </note>

of the Enemy, that their appearing timorous would
encourage the <hi>Turks,</hi> whose design being to get footing
in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Fleets ought out of honour to engage,
much more out of a sense of the Effront; what would
the World say, if the Forces of two such great Princes
joyn'd only to manage a defensive Warr against <hi>Barba-Rossa,</hi>
letting the <hi>Turkish</hi> Banners Lord it in our Seas,
in sight of the Eagles of the Empire, and the Cinques
of <hi>Portugall;</hi> that he was resolv'd to expect the Enemy,
not fearing to be Blam'd however the day went, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
if worsted, lost men answer'd nothing, and no

            <p>29. But neither had this Resolution force enough

               </note> 
               <hi>Don Iohn de Castro</hi> put himself
in the <hi>Streights</hi> mouth, where he lay three days: here
he had advice, that the Enemies Fleet steered another
course, by Dissentions of the Chief Officers, or (as
other Memorials have it) <hi>Barba-Rossa</hi> had received
new Orders from the <hi>Turk,</hi> to bring back the Fleet;
yet the Gallantry of <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi>'s staying in the
<hi>Streight,</hi> deserv'd envy from the Living, glory from
Posterity, since for the obtaining a memorable Victory,
not Courage, but Occasion was wanting; though this
so generous resolution was diversly tax'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> those
Branding it, who call all extraordinary actions Teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
yet I believe, those who most condem'd it, would
have been content to have it themselves.</p>
            <p>30. <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> seeing, by the Enemies retiring, those
places above their fear, went to <hi>Ceita,</hi> to communicate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57115:21"/>
some part of his instructions to <hi>Dom Affonso Noronha,</hi>
who receiv'd him with so many Shot, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in
<hi>Gibraltar</hi> thought the Fleet had been engag'd, yet
would they not weigh Anchor and come forth; so
alterable were they in their first, so firm in their

to the rest of the Fleet, which, (having secur'd
<hi>Ceita,</hi> and freed it from fear of the <hi>Turks</hi>) return'd to
<hi>Lisbone,</hi> where the Fame of both his adventures was
arriv'd before, which was the greater, by lighting on
Valour so unquestionable; but <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> who counted
nothing great, and despis'd his own Actions, avoided
popular applause by retiring to <hi>Sintra,</hi> either out of
Modesty, or Hight, not Valewing any thing he did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of himself.</p>
            <p>31. The King <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> was about finding out one
to Govern the State of <hi>India, Martin Affonso de Sousa</hi>
having staid out his Time, and instantly desiring a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour,
the affairs of the <hi>East,</hi> upon diverse Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
declining, and he unwilling that the glory of his
Actions should be foil'd by a mis-carriage in the Warr,
very well knowing that the Peoples ignorance might
occasion such a disgrace as might discredit many Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
for so considerable an employment, the King
look'd upon men differently qualified, upon some, who
for the antiquity of their Blood, without respect to
their Deservings, us'd to Inherit the great places, a
second piece of Tyranny of the Nobilities invention,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57115:22"/>
upon others, who were mean in their Birth, but famous
in Themselves, who lost what was due to their Merits,
because others had none; so as for so eminent an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
deserts not well Born, or a bare Title would
not do.</p>

He told him the opinion he had of <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi>'s
Temper, that, though in the business of the <hi>Streights,</hi>
many thought he had behav'd himself too Daringly;
yet 'twas certain, there's no Souldier but would be glad
to have been guilty of so Honourable a fault; that,
though those who envy'd him, accus'd him of being
High and Cynical, because he begg'd no Rewards, or
Courted the Ministers of State, these faults were of so
good a kind, that <hi>Dom Iohn</hi>'s Vices might be more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew'd

Majesty were not a King of Men, but a God of Vassals;
that he did very much love <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi> for his
Qualities, but so impartially, that he should Valew
his Deserts (though separated from his Person) in
any other.</p>
            <p>33. The King, (with whom the Infant's opinion
had no little credit, seeing him prize <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> with
a Zeal for his Prince, and Knowledge of his Friend)
lik'd the Hint the Infant gave him,<note place="margin">The King chuseth him, and speaks to him.</note> (whose Authority

               <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> kist the
King's hand, better pleas'd with the Honour, than the
Employment, in so great a charge only Valewing the
not seeking it: There were diverse Opinions in the
Court about this Election, some found fault with it
out of Envy, others out of Custom, and where they
could not tax any Defect in parts, they charged the
excess; yet was it so lik'd of the most, and best, that
the King was glad he had pitch'd upon one, who so
much pleas'd every one.</p>
            <p>34. The King gave him Orders presently to provide
the Fleet, not letting any Body else have to do with it,
as is falsly writ by one Author, who tells us, that <hi>Dom
Iohn</hi> went Discontented to the <hi>Indies,</hi> because he was
not Comply'd with in some particulars; a thing so
thwarting our certain information, and the little am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition

the season and fear too heightned the danger, when
the Ship being all on one side,<note place="margin">Not feeling the Rudder.</note> and not feeling the

but seem'd a miracle. The Governour commanded
'em to shoot off three Pieces, that the Ships which were

the Warning came upon 'em; but with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Luck, than Skil, though of the same Burden with
the Admiral, scap'd the Sands, finding in the same place

            <p>38. The Governour,<note place="margin">He arrives at <hi>Mocam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique.</hi>
               </note> with the whole Fleet got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
pursuing his Voyage arriv'd at <hi>Mocambique,</hi>
where the Landing of, and the procuring conveniencies
for, the sick men was what he chiefly minded, being
in that assisted by his two Sons, <hi>Dom Alvaro,</hi> and <hi>Dom

by which, with difficulty it provided and reliev'd our

agreed that the faults in the Fortification were judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
observ'd; what was Debated was immediately
put in hand, and with the choice of a convenient Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
he ordered Materials and Work-men for a new

defence; and this going on in the Governours sight,
the Gentry as well as others carry'd Stones, some for
Flattery, others to promote the Building.</p>
            <p>39. The Fortress made tenable, and the Sick reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd

               </note> the
Governour set Sail again, and having the Winds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
favourable, cast Anchor on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>September</hi>
at the Barr of <hi>Goa;</hi> where, <hi>Martin Affonso de Sousa,</hi>
(by a Ship which went before) having had notice his
Successour was near, provided to receive him with such
Jollity as might shew the content he had, in welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Guest, and leaving his Government; he went
presently in a Rich Brigantine to meet him at Sea,
whence he carry'd him to <hi>Antoni Correa</hi>'s House of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
whilst the Solemnity of his reception was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
there he Feasted the Governour, Gentlemen,
and Captains of the Fleet, with so much Exquisiteness
in the manner, and aboundance in the meat, that it
seem'd he was doing the last honour to his expiring
charge. That night there were Balls and Dancing,
Rejoycings which the simplicity of old <hi>Portugall</hi>
carry'd to the <hi>East.</hi> Here the Governour staid two
days, attended by all the Gentlemen of the place, who
forsook <hi>Martin Affonso de Sousa,</hi> even those who were
his Favourites, and he had rais'd from nothing, disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd
in the Oriental ingratitude of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who
cast stones at the setting Sun, and adore him rising.</p>
            <p>40. When the Entry was to be, the two Governours
were in a Faluque with gilded Oars, and an awning of
divers-colour'd Silks; the Castles and Ships entertain'd
'em with the horrour of reiterated shootings, the Vivas
and expectation of the common people did without
any cunning flatter the new Government;<note place="margin">His arrival, and recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> they came to
Land at a great place where the Common-Councel in
a body expected them, and when they were plac'd with
all the Ceremony vanity for that purpose hath inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
one of the Magistrates made an Elaborate speech,
in which the State expected a great deal of happiness
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57115:24"/>
in the new Minister; after the Governour had heard
the publick Flatteries, he listned to the private ones of
a great many, who with them made way for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Interest.</p>
            <p>41. When the Solemnity was ended,<note place="margin">What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he found his Government in</note> and <hi>Don Iohn</hi>
possest of the Government of <hi>India, Martin Affonso</hi>
went to <hi>Cochim,</hi> to provide for his return into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
the Governour immediately was engag'd in the
care of quieting the People, who were all in an Uproar
for the alteration of the Money, which the King's
Officers had rais'd, to the prejudice of the Subjects, and
the scandal of the Neighbouring Pagans; I'le tell the
occasion begun it.</p>
            <p>42. There is current in <hi>India</hi> a low sort of Money,<note place="margin">by the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Bazaruccos.</hi>
               </note>
which they call <hi>Bazaruccos,</hi> which amongst <hi>Christians,
Moors,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> had always the same Valew; this
being of Copper, (which then came from <hi>Portugall</hi> and
bore no price) the Officers thought fit for the King's
profit to raise the price, the alteration of the Money
was solemnly Proclaim'd, and it began to pass at the
new Rate; but, as this Legal worth was not intrinsical,
(the Valew coming from the Law, not from the
weight) the <hi>Pagans</hi> (not subject to strangers Laws)
brought not in the usual Provision, and the people
seem'd to suffer by their own orders; the Chief Officers
back'd it as the King's cause, standing for the King's
profit, in the Peoples destruction; the whole City
cry'd out, that the Kings of <hi>Portugall</hi> never encreast
their Treasuries by their miseries, nor us'd to Drink in
Gold plate their Subjects tears; that the <hi>Pagans</hi> and
<hi>Moors</hi> made their Braggs that not being able by the
Sword to ruine the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> by their own Laws they
Destroy'd 'em, arming against 'em the ambition of their
Governours. The hunger and liberty of the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
grew high, justify'd by a good cause, and the
Conformity of the common oppression;<note place="margin">He hears the City and People.</note> with these
grievances the Magistrates of the City, with the poor,
Women, and Children, (some full of Complaints, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57115:25"/>
other of Arguments) went to the Governour, who
Commanding the people to be quiet, heard, as a Judge
the Magistracy, as a Father the rest, and hunger admitting
of no long Cures, ordered the next day for determining
the business; thus he sent them away satisfy'd, some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that (as was the custom of <hi>India</hi>) it being his
predecessors Act, it would by him be counted unjust. The
same evening he sent for the King's Officers,<note place="margin">His resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about it.</note> and after
hearing what they had to say for themselves, referr'd the
matter to the ablest Lawyers, and those best skill'd in
the policy of that State, who unanimously agreed the
decree to be Cruel, and very contrary to the Pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of our Princes; this opinion too was counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd
by Custom, and the Peoples privileges, besides
other Legalties, which (not to make our History tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous)
we lay aside. This Law being revok'd by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
Provisions began to come in from the Inland-Country,
and the people made him a present of those

the second Person in the Kingdome in Power, and the

<hi>Hidalcaon</hi> (as amongst this so Barbarous a people

way to the Crown, began to try the hearts of the great
Ones, before whom with a great deal of Artifice he
deplor'd the miseries of the Kingdome, in so Infant a
successour, under whom they must obey or endure, as
so many Kings all those he fancy'd; that the Princes
with whom they had now Warrs would not let slip
this occasion of ruining 'em, when they saw him who
should defend 'em in the Cradle; that where, there were
so many, they ought to find out one to save their
Country; that he would be the first should obey him,
because the Government of the Kingdome could not
wait those slow motions, by which Nature gives a little
one first Strength, then Understanding; that if with
unprofitable obedience they should adore <hi>Meale</hi> in his
Nurses arms, he did not doubt but by keeping their
King, they would lose their Kingdome. He was affable
to the People, liberal to the Souldiers, as if he desir'd
to Reign not for himself, but for them: Ambitiously
making use of, the whole Chain of Vertues, not as
necessary for Living, but Reigning. The great Ones
at last offered him the Crown, believing, he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
remember he was his Subjects Creature, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etain constantly in his Memory so signal a grace.</p>
            <p>45. <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> was Liberal and Stout, and without
doubt would have been a great Prince, had he kept the
Kingdome by the same Vertues he put on to atchieve
it; but seeing himself obey'd, those affected Artifices
not having any natural motion, were at an end, and
broke out into ambition and pride, the Vices of his
Person; He did not then speak of killing <hi>Meale,</hi> either
out of a counterfeit Clemency, or an unheard of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
intending perhaps that the poor Prince should by
a servile obedience confirm the Scepter he had usurp'd
from him. The Nobility of the Kingdome (repenting
when 'twas too late, and seeing they now could not
without danger, be either Traitors or Loyal) consulted
how <hi>Meale</hi> might secure himself from the Tyranny of
<hi>Hidalcaon,</hi> as if the unfortunate Prince had had more

right to his Life then his Kingdome; some years past
in these contrivances, in which <hi>Meale</hi> arriv'd at Age to
apprehend his danger, and considering that his presence
reproach'd the Tyrants guilty Conscience, (who plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his blood to quiet the memory of his usurping
the Crown,) by the Counsel of those who took the
Kingdome from him, He went to <hi>Cambaya,</hi> where he
was well receiv'd, both King and People shewing, how
much they resented the miseries of the Blood-Royal;
but, as such favours have more ambition in them, then
charity, they lasted not long, for, only the first days they
treated him as a King, the rest as one Persequuted, but
<hi>Meale</hi> still continu'd in <hi>Cambaya,</hi> counting more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the sleights of a Stranger, then the injuries of a
Tyrant.</p>
            <p>46. In the mean time, <hi>Hidalcaon</hi>'s great design was,
to destroy those who gave him the Crown, whom, for
all they had a just title to his favour by being complices
in his Treason, he hated, because they put him in mind,
either of his Obligation, or faults, and being now jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of his own Actions, he found that Cruelty would
root him faster then Clemency, so that his own Vice,
and necessity together made him doubly so; upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of correcting faults, either imputed, or forgot,
(covering his Tyranny with a veil of Justice) he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroach'd
upon the Estates of the great Ones, to Level
'em with the common people, Confident, by pulling
down the Nobility, to get into the poorer sort, who
(out of a natural dislike of their own Fortune) do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
delight in the fall of those above them; and they
(seeing their patience work'd not their quiet) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
how they might restore <hi>Meale,</hi> some were for
Revenge, others for Calling him in; they had their
private meetings, where they took divers Resolutions,
which fear, or the difficulty of the business, (harder
to execute then design) every day altered; their forc'd
obedience being at last wrack'd to the utmost stretch
by new oppressions, they endeavour'd by <hi>Hidalcaon</hi>'s
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57115:27"/>
Death to redress their Error, and hide the shame of
their former Treason; the Desperate, not the Bold
were of this opinion, because now <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> liv'd with
the strength of a King, and the circumspection of a
Tyrant; He was assisted by the people, who hating the
King, lov'd the Cruelties he us'd against the Gentry,
who, for the disproportion of theirs, and the others
Fortunes are always obnoxious. The Plotters fearfull
of themselves, and that their hatred would cool by
delay, their base servitude too, turn Customary, seeing
their own Force not equal for the enterprize, laid out
for assistance from abroad; they bethought themselves
of imparting the business to <hi>Martin Affonso de Sousa,</hi>
(then Governour of the State of <hi>India</hi>) desiring him
to send for <hi>Meale</hi> from <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and let him be at <hi>Goa;</hi>
that though he refus'd the glory of restoring him, he
thereby would keep <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> in awe, and inclinable
to serve the States occasions.</p>
            <p>47. <hi>Martin Affonso</hi> being perswaded, that 'twas more
convenient to increase then extinguish this Flame
which begun to burst out, 'twixt <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> and his
Subjects, and that the weakning of a Warlike and
Powerfull neighbour would turn to the States advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
(Cloaking these conveniences with more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
pretences, as the sheltering under our Arms a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest
and persecuted Prince, an Action glorious abroad
and profitable at home) resolv'd to find out <hi>Meale</hi> at

The <hi>Moor</hi> upon the receit of so unlook'd for a message,
(counting the pity, of men not only different but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

the Guest. <hi>Meale</hi>'s arrival (who begun now
to Reign in the hearts of a great many) being voic'd
all along that Coast, his party began to be stronger
among the Plotters, who now saw, his cause sheltered
under the protection of our Arms, and his name sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
better in the peoples Ears.</p>
            <p>48. <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> upon consideration,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hidalcaon</hi>'s Embassage.</note> that the State
(whose victorious Arms were the more dreadfull by
their nearness) did not send for <hi>Meale</hi> only to secure
his Person, but defend his Cause, dispatch'd Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
to <hi>Martin Affonso de Sousa,</hi> giving him notice that
he understood <hi>Meale</hi> was in his power, whom, he
thought Fortune preserv'd, to disturb the peace of the
<hi>East;</hi> that he knew what Title some Seditious spirits
gave him, who being weary of Obeying, strove to set
up new Lords whom they might Command; that
<hi>Hidalcaon</hi> would not tell what mov'd him to seize on
the Crown, because if Princes were bound to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Pretensions, there were no difference
'twixt King and People; that the right of Princes was
to be judged of God, not of Men; that 'twas the
Worlds opinion now that there was no difference in
Princes titles, but only in their Persons; that he deny'd
not, that Contemptible and Cowardly <hi>Meale</hi> was of the
Royal blood, but, that, the fault Nature committed,
Fortune would correct by giving the Kingdome to him
who was Daring and Stout; that nature to Lyons only
gave a Crown by their Birth, Men she let winn it and
wear it; that many things appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d injust to the World,
because besides Custom; that for a man who was worthy
of it, to possess himself of a Kingdome, would at first
be look'd upon as a Scandal, afterwards as a Law; that
<hi>Meale</hi> was the basest Fellow ever Born in his Kingdome,
and he the most Fortunate, and naturally all men hated
natures Monsters, and lov'd Fortunes prodigies: that
we should examine our selves, how we came to Lord
it in <hi>Asia?</hi> what Kin we vvere to <hi>Sabayo,</hi> that he should
leave us <hi>Goa?</hi> how near vve were <hi>Sultan Badour</hi> to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57115:28"/>
Inherit <hi>Dio</hi> from him? whether <hi>Achem</hi> left us <hi>Malaxa</hi>
by his Will? and all the places which pay us Tribute
all over the <hi>East?</hi> that he desir'd us not to quarrel at
that Title in him, that made us absolute Lords of the
World; that, we should let God alone with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the World, and being Born farthest <hi>West,</hi>
not busie our selves to compose the Disorders of <hi>Asia;</hi>
that he would have us know, he had in his Kingdome
Mines of different Metals, that some furnish'd him
with Gold for his Friends, others with Iron for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
that in the last place, he desir'd the Governour
to deliver him up <hi>Meale,</hi> that, by the mercy he should
use him withall, the World might see how worthy he
was to Reign, who so treated his greatest Enemy; that,
his Embassadours had order to settle all that concern'd
the State.</p>
            <p>49. <hi>Martin Affonso</hi> having receiv'd the Letters, and
given Audience to <hi>Hidalcaon</hi>'s Embassadours, understood
by 'em, that they proffer'd for <hi>Meales</hi> person an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty thousand <hi>Pardaos,</hi> and the main Land of
<hi>Bordez</hi> and <hi>Salsete,</hi> very considerable to the State for its
Revenue and Nearness to <hi>Goa. Martin Affonso</hi> look'd
upon the business, as very weighty, and either Face
promising great advantages; the restoring of a Prince,
and pulling down a Tyrant, was a design worthy the
Arms of Christians, by which the State would purchase
no ordinary reputation, letting the World see, that our
Banners were not displaid in <hi>Asia,</hi> either to usurp King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
or get Riches, since their employment was that
the <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> of the <hi>East,</hi> should keep the true
Faith towards God, and Justice amongst themselves:
On the other side 'twas said, that if <hi>Meale</hi> after a long
Warr should come to Reign, he could not give the
State more, then now without it <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> offer'd, and
that the <hi>Moors</hi> by their hatred and Religion being
Enemies, the World would laugh to see us with our
own Blood, destroy one Infidel and set up an other;
when too our happiness depended on both their ruines,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57115:29"/>
besides that our Arms came not to <hi>India</hi> to defend the
Enemies of the Faith, but to destroy 'em; that if <hi>Meale</hi>
found no Protection from the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> his near
Kinsman, why should he look for't from the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
to whom he was an Enemy? that when he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
restor'd, and strong, the first Lance that was hurl'd
against the State would be his, because the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of so brave men who made him King would be
suspicious to him, and the Memory of so great a good
turn was enough to make him Hate us.</p>
            <p>50. <hi>Martin Affonso,</hi> on grounds not throughly
weigh'd, resolv'd at last to deliver up <hi>Meale,</hi> dispach'd
the Embassadours; and with them <hi>Galvaon Viegas</hi> an
Honourable Gentleman, with full Power, to settle the
Contract, in the manner it hath been related, sending
with the consent of the Embassadours to take imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
possession of the main Land, in virtue of <hi>Hidal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caon</hi>'s
profer.</p>
            <p>51. In this condition did <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi> find
the affairs of <hi>Meale,</hi> and was sued to by a new Embassy
from <hi>Hidalcaon,</hi> in confidence of the Capitulation made
with his Predecessor;<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> but <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> with different
maturity answered <hi>Hidalcaon,</hi> that the <hi>Portuguese</hi> were
faithfull to their Enemies, much more to their Guest;
that the propositions of his Predecessor, were more for
a right understanding of the cause,<note place="margin">See <hi>Iohn de Barro</hi>'s History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 1. Cap. 2.</note> then to determine
it; that the main Land belong'd to the State by more
antient Grants, and that it was just out of its Revenue
to maintain <hi>Meale,</hi> in gratitude to the Kings his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
who annex'd it to the State, that he should
suffer him quietly to enjoy this little memory of his
Right; that the States securing his Person, was not
yet Protection but Charity; that he should not with
over-hasty Arms disturb the Peace, for then he would
make sure what he fear'd, provoking the State to take
in hand the revenging of both; and because his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
had hinted that, the denying <hi>Meale</hi> would
necessarily make a Breach, He put 'em in mind that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57115:29"/>
most of the Fortresses we had made in <hi>India,</hi> were
founded on the ashes of destroy'd Kingdoms; that the
<hi>Portuguese</hi> were like the Sea, which raiseth it self and
grows greater in Storms; that for his part as he sought
not a Warr, so he could not deny one.</p>
            <p>52. With this answer the Governour dismist the
Embassadours, who, by his firmness in delivering it,
understood that neither fear or advantage would bend
him to give up <hi>Meale;</hi> Immediately he put himself in
readiness to make or expect a Warr, which coming
from a neighbour Prince we might sooner feel the Blow,
then see the Sword. He gave orders for the raising of
Horse, which were to be about two hundred, and to
serve under the same Colours, a more stout, then order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Militia: He entrusted the Guard of the City with
the Train-bands, and had Souldiers in pay ready for
any suddain invasion of the Enemies. He set upon the
making ready the Fleet out of hand, which by the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
and Warrs of his Predecessor, and the poverty of
the State, he found all in pieces, and the strength of the
Navy, being what is most considerable, here he wholly
laid himself out; He new fitted the Vessels which lay
in the River, made three Galleys, and six Round-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd
Ships with wonderfull speed, not failing the
Officers in their pay, or his thanks; by which means the
work went on, diligence over-coming time; He nam'd
Captains of those Galleys and Ships, who intended
the work as their own business, an expedient, which did
a great deal towards the quickness of the dispatch, the
goodness and plenty of Ammunion and Provision,
with which (in an opportune and short time) the
Fleet was ready, with this he so bridled the Neighbour
Princes, as he hindred 'em from joyning with <hi>Hidalcaon,</hi>
who had already sollicited them to shake off the yoak,
as an advantage to the common Liberty.</p>

presence rais'd the people, who by their commands,
and advantages in the Warr, would make the cause
their own: He presently on severe penalties forbid the
Victuallers carrying the ordinary Provision to <hi>Goa,</hi>
which, having it all from the Inland, was not furnish'd
to endure so suddain a Warr; after this he sent <hi>Acede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caon</hi>

that part of the main Land, which Liv'd under our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>54. But <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi> knowing, that first suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses

thousand Foot, and the Horse of the place to resist the
Enemy, and being perswaded by a great many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that he should not engage his person in so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
a party; that it was not for the honour of a
Governour of <hi>India</hi> to put on his Sword against one of
<hi>Hidalcaon</hi>'s Captains, nor to let the World know he
look'd so much upon this Warr, especially having Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
who deserv'd the honour and danger of the
Action; it was not possible to disswade him from his
first resolution, saying with more confidence then his
Forces would bear, that he went out to Chastise, not
to Overcome, and marching two Leagues from <hi>Goa</hi>
he came in sight of the Enemy, who, lodg'd at the foot
of a Hill with a River in their front, (which was to
them instead of a Ditch and Trench) with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of their numbers, and Encamping, expected ours,
who though wearied with their March, re-inforcing
themselves by the presence of the Governour, or sight
of the Enemy, begun to pass the River with more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
then Discipline, the Commanders could not
stay, or order them, the most daring cast themselves
into the River, and the more cautious were by this put
upon a necessity; as to most of 'em to follow their
Comrades example, past for Discipline.</p>
            <p>55. The Governour with admirable prudence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
those who staid behind to go over the River,
knowing, that what was in the beginning a fault, was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57115:30"/>
now the Cure; and because that day he had not room
enough to Order as a Commander,<note place="margin">He fights and routs the Enemy.</note> he Fought as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Souldier. Our men run upon the <hi>Moors</hi> so furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
that discouraged, with the first Onset, they gave
ground, and their Ranks, being confus'd and broken by
themselves, were disordered and overcome; Our men
(which seldome happens) seeing an Army routed
without loss. The <hi>Moors</hi> loss was great in their Flight,
none at all in their Resistance; Ours were two Leagues
executing the Liberty, and cruelty of Victory, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Arms those poor men flung away, as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
not a defence. The pursute lasted as long as the
Day, the horrour of the Night freeing the Enemies
from that of the Victory; Our Souldiers retreated, full
of Blood, Honour, and Booty; the Governour kept the
Field till the next day, without censuring the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
for that Disorder which gave them the Victory,
following the course of human judgements, which never
speak well of Losses, or blame Victories.</p>
            <p>56. The Governour,<note place="margin">He returns to <hi>Goa.</hi>
               </note> at his Entry into <hi>Goa,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
with an extraordinary applause, from that people,
so us'd to see, and slight Victories; and because, in this
and many other Fights which <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> wonn, he
call'd upon the name of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Apostle of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> we believe they were got by the favour of so
great a <hi>Padrone,</hi> who, to recompence the piety, and

with a due, but a strange Reverence,
(lighting always from his <hi>Palanquim</hi> or Horse when he
met the Cross,<note place="margin">A kind of Sedan in the <hi>Indies,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd on mens Shoulders.</note> and putting himself on his Knees) this
discovery will not seem to have been by chance, since
the mercies of Heaven come not by accident. We will
give you the relation of the Mystery, because it carries

corrupted by the Doctrine of the <hi>Armenian</hi> and <hi>Chaldean</hi>
Priests, who separated from the <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholick
Church, did make those well-meaning Christians
swallow dangerous Opinions, which by the pains of our
Missionaries have in part been reform'd) set upon
Building a Church in the same place where the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Body of the Apostle was found, and opening the
Foundations for the Fabrick, found a Cross (wrought in
a Marble Pedestall) of four Spans long and three broad,
besprinkled with dropps of Blood, which might be
thought to be newly done, (the Cross was like that of
the Knights of <hi>Aviz;</hi>) on the bottom of the Pedestall
were lesser Crosses of the same fashion with the biggest,
sprinkled with the same spots of Blood; on the top of
the great Cross was a hovering Pidgeon, there was Old
writing about it, which, (being in an unknown
Tongue, and not in one continued sence) the Natives
understood not; the oldest and most knowing Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries
in different Languages were consulted with,
but none could make out the Character or meaning of
the Writing, till a while after was brought a <hi>Bramene</hi>
from <hi>Narzinga,</hi> who expounded it in current Sence, and
said thus;</p>

<hi>Thomas</hi> Dy'd in <hi>Meliapor,</hi> where was the knowledge of
God, change of Laws, and the destruction of the Devil;
This God taught twelve Apostles, one of whom, with a staff
in his hand, came to <hi>Meliapor</hi> where he Built a Temple, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57115:31"/>
the Kings of <hi>Malabar, Choromandell,</hi> and <hi>Pandi,</hi> with
others of different Nations and Sects freely submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Law; time was when the Saint
was put to Death by a <hi>Bramene,</hi> and with his Blood made
this Cross.</p>
            <p>This Exposition, being an hir'd Interpreters, in a
matter of so great moment, our Nation did not too
confidenly believe, but sent for an other <hi>Pagan</hi> Learn'd

of the other Exposition, decypher'd the Letters in the

Our Nation (with the greater expence in reverence
to that place, which had been the Depository of so
Sacred a pledge) went on in Building the Church, the
Piety and Conflux of the people of <hi>Malabar</hi> was great
too, at the sight of so notable a Testimony of their
Faith. The Church was in a short time perfected, the
Cross engrav'd on Marble (as we have said) serv'd
in place of Altar-piece. Divine Service began to be
said there, with the Decency so remote a place would
permit; and on the 18. of <hi>December,</hi> (the day of our

the Miracle might be more Visible, the Priest stop't
in the Sacrifice, wip't off the Humidity the Cross
breath'd with the Corporalls, which (before a great
many there present immediately seem'd dip't in Blood);
the Holy Cross began presently to change its Alablaster
to a paler Colour, which turn'd to an obscure black,
that too chang'd to an unusual bright <hi>Azure,</hi> which
lasted as long as Mass, when that was done it came to
the natural Colour of which 'twas found.</p>
            <p>58. The same Miracle hath successively for many
years been seen on the same day, and we know by good
Authors and faithfull Relations that it yet happens
sometimes, by which means, those Christians with a
stronger Faith receive our Doctrine. This Miracle, after
much arguing on both sides, was clear'd before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

this Kingdome, in the time of the King <hi>Dom Henry,</hi> the
Cardinal, who, by the consent of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>

            <p>59. <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> gave not over infesting us on the main
Land with his usual incursions, which kept us on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Duty, and hindered the Husbandmen from Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
upon which the Governour resolv'd to strike
where the Blow might be most felt;<note place="margin">He sends his Son <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalcaon.</hi>
               </note> He presently
Commanded his Son <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> to go out with the
Fleet, he had provided, with Orders, to do all the hurt
he could in <hi>Hidalcaon</hi>'s Ports, giving the Souldiers all
free Pillage, that the hopes of Plunder might make 'em
not mention some Arrerages the State ow'd 'em; and
put by others from playing the Merchants, a Corruption
which stole upon a great many by the foul example of
their Superiours.</p>
            <p>60. <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> put to Sea with 900. <hi>Portuguese</hi>
and 400.<note place="margin">He goes out with six Ships.</note> 
               <hi>Indians</hi> on six Ships and some long Boats with
Oars, and after a few days Sailing spy'd four of <hi>Hidal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caon</hi>'s
Ships going with Stuffs and other Commodities
to <hi>Cambaya. Dom Alvaro</hi> presently commanded his
Captains to come on Head him, and the Boats to keep
close to the shore, for fear the Enemy should out of
Desperatness run a ground; the Ships were Merchant
men, and but few Souldiers in 'em, who, seeing they
could neither fly,<note place="margin">His prize.</note> nor defend themselves, sent aboard
the Admiral two <hi>Moor</hi> Merchants, who, with reasons and
tears, shew'd themselves not concern'd in the difference
'twixt <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> and the State, and profer'd a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
present toward the expence of the Fleet; but
neither the covetousness of the Souldiers, or the policy
of Warr would let them be heard, but the Ships were
Boarded and sent to <hi>Goa,</hi> that the Prize might be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
according to the Governours Proclamation. Upon
the arrival of those Ships at <hi>Goa,</hi> the people was
stangely transported, seeing Victories so got one upon
the neck of an other; in the first they prais'd the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57115:34"/>
of the Father, in the second the Fortune of the
Son.</p>
            <p>61. <hi>Dom Alvaro,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dom Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> proposeth the Entry into <hi>Cambre.</hi>
               </note> seeing opportunity and weather
on his side, and that the Souldiers were contented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had in hand the fruit of their late Enterprize,
commanded his Pilot to steer to the Port of <hi>Cambre,</hi>
where, since the breaking out of the Warr, <hi>Hidalcaon</hi>
kept double Garrison; there were two Forts with
Ordinance planted at the entrance of the Barr, and the
Chanel was so narrow that without eminent danger
our Ships could neither pass through, or ride there.
The General <hi>Dom Alvaro,</hi> put to the Captains of the
Fleet the apparent difficulties, which every one conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of moment enough to be considered of, alleging
that voluntary undertakings ought not to be set upon
with so certain danger; that they should more to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
carry on the Warr against <hi>Hidalcaon,</hi> by Lording it
in his Seas, and in his sight, taking away his commerce;
that there was more hazard then profit in what could
be done by Land; that (as they saw) the Chanel was
so begirt with those Forts, our Ships must pass by the
mouth of the Canon; that the first Ship they should
shatter, would hinder the rest from passing. But <hi>Dom
Alvaro</hi> urging,<note place="margin">He resolves to invest.</note> that he was resolv'd to execute his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
which were, to get on shore and burn the Enemies
Ports; the Councel replied by proposing, that he as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
should stay to Command at Sea, and that most of
the Commanders of the Ships would strive to pass the
Barr, because if any thing should happen amiss to the
Admiral of that Fleet, Son and Heir to the Governour of
<hi>India,</hi> what greater Dammage could the State receive,
then the necessity of engaging in so just a Vengeance?
On which <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> in a great deal of passion brake
off the consult, saying, that he car'd for no Victories
where his danger was not as great as the least common
Souldiers; that, out of obedience he was their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and in danger their Companion; that, he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
from the Governour, to venture his own
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57115:35"/>
Person on every occasion, his Souldiers but upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
that he look'd upon the Dangers they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to be less then those he came in chase of, because
Honour was not to be purchas'd without hazarding;
that he came from <hi>Portugall</hi> to find out this Day, which
he hop't would be glorious for them all, and that in
this Resolution he ask't not their advice, only that they
would consult about the manner of the falling on. The
Generals Gallantry, and Youth, did then excuse his
Rashness, afterwards the Success; 'twas agreed that the
men should go into the long Boats, and that at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Dawning when Day-light was not well
broke, and so the Enemy not sure of his aim, they
should get on shore;<note place="margin">He gets on shore.</note> they all that Night provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
seeing in the Generals looks hopes of Victory.
The General (having left sufficient Guard on the Ships)
got on shore, with 800. Choise men, and with Fortune
so declaring for him, that of a great many Shot that
lighted on the Boats, not one either kill'd or wounded
a Souldier, this accident being a Disposition to, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Victory.</p>
            <p>62. The City (which ran along a great Plain) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
five thousand Families, the Houses by themselves,
and not leaning on one an other, without any other
policy,<note place="margin">The large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and strength of the place.</note> union, or share of ground, then what every one
took for his pleasure or ability; and yet the Turrets
and Balconies of every House, did altogether present a
rude Stateliness, as if Built with more Pride then Art;
it had on the North-side a little Mountain, whence ran
some small Rivulets, with no name, which, contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
both to the pleasantness and fertility of the Soil.
The City was antiently Inhabited by the <hi>Bramenes,</hi> now
by Merchant <hi>Moors,</hi> a place amongst the <hi>Eastern</hi> people
always famous, then for Superstition, now for Wealth;
it was not defended by either Walls or Works, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
being secure by the Power of their Lords, or
the Peace they preserv'd with the Neighbouring Princes;
but at present, the Warr we had with <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57115:35"/>
Victoriously, the <hi>Moors,</hi> saw the danger they were
in, by example, and had drawn two thousand paid
Souldiers to Guard the City, who with the standing
Militia, were (according to their computation) suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for their Defence.</p>
            <p>63. These came, with their Colours flying, and with
so much resolution to hinder our men from Landing,
as for a good while they retarded us, obliging us to
Fight at a stand,<note place="margin">The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> and so close as our Souldiers could not
make use of their Musquets, whose first charge only,
they receiv'd with notorious resolution. Here <hi>Dom
Alvaro</hi> notably shew'd his Valour and Conduct, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
his men to Fight, sometimes by Speeches, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by the Example of his own Actions. Ours at last
saw themselves so streightned as they fought more for
Life then Victory. The success, for an hour hung doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
till a great many of the Inhabitants, wounded
with their own fear, and our Swords, quitted the Field,
shewing in the first encounter, Valour, above Men, in
the second, below Women, a thing very ordinary in
raw Souldiers, where the greatest fear follows the
greatest daring; the rest by this example were getting
off, in fear and disorder; here the <hi>Moors</hi> receiv'd great
loss, falling with little or no Resistance, those who
drop't too were so many as they hindred the rest from
Flying.</p>
            <p>64. Ours entred the City mingled with the <hi>Moors,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ours enter,</note>
where the poor men stop't, o'recome with the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and tears of Wives, and Children, who then with
useless compassion bore 'em company, rather Witnesses,
then Defenders of their Lives; some there were, who
embracing their Husbands let themselves be run through
with our Lances, inventing fresh sadness by a new
remedy; Of our Souldiers, some Robb'd 'em, some
Defended 'em, some following the disposition of the
Season, others of their Nature; Out of desperate Love
some of those Women ran amongst our arm'd Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
to seek their Dead, seeming not to valew their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57115:36"/>
Lives; full of tenderness for others Wounds, without
any for their own;<note place="margin">and gain the City.</note> at last we gain'd the City with less
loss, then danger, because resolving to enter under the
Enemies Canon, <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> was more lead on by
Courage, then Discipline; the greater part of the
<hi>Moors</hi> was Destroy'd, some in the Fight, most in the
Flight; the VVomen shew'd more Courage, then their
Husbands; These lost their Lives, they could not
defend, the others despis'd theirs they might have
sav'd; of ours there Dy'd twenty two, the VVounded
were more, of whose number was the General hurt by
an Arrow. 'Twas necessary to end one Cruelty to begin
an other, their Anger ceast, and their Covetousness
began; <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> gave order to Plunder the City,
where the Booty was as great as the Victory,<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying and Plundring of it.</note> because,
either out of Confidence or Carelesness the <hi>Moors</hi> had
sav'd nothing, and kept in the City those who were
useless for the Defence of it, out of contempt of our
Forces, or not to dishearten their own. In fine, the
Prize was so great, that it could not all be carry'd
aboard, the Souldiers took the best, leaving the rest as
Fuel for that Fire which was to Consume the City,
by <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> given up to the merciless Flames;
which did not a little strike the Neighbouring Colonies,
that place being the Richest and most Tenable of all
the Coast, once, as it were, the Bulwark of the rest,
now their Lamentable example.</p>
            <p>65. The General with all the Fleet weigh'd Anchor,
and steer'd for <hi>Goa</hi> to unlade the Ships,<note place="margin">

there the Sick and VVounded, and return to carry on

and Fortune of their new General, very much
desir'd. The news arriv'd at <hi>Goa</hi> before the Ships, the
Governour very much valued the Victory, the people
the Plunder; not long after came intelligence, that
those who had scap'd the Rout had been to acquaint
<hi>Hidalcaon</hi> with the lamentable Destruction of their

City, who, while they vented their first grief for their
Children and Kindred, could not keep in the second
calamity of their Goods and Houses, where the devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Fire had so mingled the Ashes, they could not with
peculiar tears, weep over their Dead; they told <hi>Hidal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caon,</hi>
that if he resolv'd to continue the Warr with such
a people, they would go and Inhabit the Deserts, where

            <p>66. <hi>Hidalcaon,</hi> considering the fortune of our Arms,
the complaints,<note place="margin">

many disaffected to his Service, whom the Warr, and

to Peace, thereby to remedy the Dissentions and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at home, which might grow stronger by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of men in Arms; and communicating to his
Councel the present condition of things, all were of
opinion, they ought by a feignd peace to cloak their
grievances, expecting till time offered 'em a fairer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to set upon the State, joyning their Forces
with other Kings who were offended. And the <hi>Moors</hi>
fighting more for their conveniency then quarrel, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalcaon</hi>
sent Embassadours to the Governour, frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
excusing the Warr he made, and minding him of
the benefit the State might receive by his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p>67. The Governour, in publick and in great State,
gave audience to the Embassadours,<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour accepts it.</note> answering them,
that as he sought not for Warr, so he could not deny
it; that the felicity of the State consisted in having
many Enemies, because with Spoils and Victories it grew
always greater; but, that he never deny'd Peace to any
one, who by his Actions, and faithfull Friendship de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
it; that he would deprive his Souldiers of the
conveniences they look't for from that Warr; but
<hi>Hidalcaon</hi> must know the first day he was to pass for a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57115:37"/>
King, was that in which he treated Peace with the
<hi>Portuguese.</hi> Thus did he dispatch the Embassadours, aw'd
with so great a Courage; with the same neglect did he
always manage the Warrs in the <hi>East,</hi> in which his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
was equal to his Fortune.</p>
            <p>68. He presently betook himself to the dispatching
particular business,<note place="margin">He looks to the affairs of the State,</note> rewarding the Souldiers who had
serv'd him, whom he parted with as well satisfy'd with
the rewards he gave them, as his acceptance of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
He put Commanders into the void Forts, which
were unprovided by the King; making so just an esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of Deserts, that he was Debtor neither to conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency,
or the State, a virtue hardly arriv'd at by Princes,
and very rare in their Ministers.</p>
            <p>69. He was not less fir'd with zeal for the honour of
God, then for that of the State, in the confusion of
Warr, and the noise of Arms, applying himself to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion,<note place="margin">and matters of Religion.</note> as if he had been only sent to stickle
for them. And the King <hi>Dom Iohn,</hi> knowing his Piety,
as well as his Valour, commended to him the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Faith, and Divine worship. Out of a Letter,
which on this Subject the King writ him, is well gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
how both King and Minister were inflam'd in God's
cause, of which we will here give a Copy, that the World
may see our Arms in the <hi>East,</hi> brought more Sons to

                  <p>FRiend and Governour. The great Concernment, which lies
upon Christian Princes to look to matters of Faith, and
employ their Forces for its Preservation, makes me advise
you how sensible I am, that not only, in many parts of <hi>India</hi>
under our Subjection, but even in our City of <hi>Goa,</hi> Idols
are Worshipp't, places in which our Faith might more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57115:37"/>
be expected to Flourish; and being as well inform'd
with how much liberty they celebrate Heathenish festivals,
we command you, to discover by diligent Officers all the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
and to demolish and break 'em in pieces where ere they
are found; Proclaiming severe punishments against any one
who shall dare, to Work, Cast, make in Sculpture, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,
Paint, or bring to light, any Figure of an Idol, in
Metall, Brass, Wood, Plaister, or any other matter, or bring
them from other places; and against those, who publickly,
or privately, Celebrate any of their sports, keep by them any
Heathenish Frankincense, or assist and hide the <hi>Bramenes,</hi>
the sworn Enemies of Christian Profession; whosoever of
the fore-nam'd shall run into the like Crimes, 'tis our pleasure
you Punish 'em, with that severity the Law in that case, or
our Prolamation requires, without admitting any appeal or
dispensation in the least. And that the <hi>Pagans</hi> may submit
themselves to the yoak of the Gospel, not only out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the purity of its Faith, and fed with the hopes of
Eternal Life, but be advantag'd too, by some temporal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
shew'd 'em, (which doth very much work upon Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
hearts) you are with all Diligence to see that the new
Christians, may henceforward have and enjoy all the Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Liberties from Taxes, enjoying those Privileges,
and places of Honour, which the <hi>Pagans</hi> did hitherto use to
do. We have too been inform'd, that many <hi>Indians</hi> are forc't
to go in our Fleet, and are for that at charges against their
wills, desiring that so great Exorbitancy should be remedy'd,
we order that the <hi>Christians</hi> be exempt from that Oppression,
and in case the necessity be very pressing, you shall if they go,
(with that trust we look for, from your care, and diligence)
provide, that they be every day satisfy'd for their Labour;
Having known too, from grave and credible Persons, (and
what we particularly resented) that some <hi>Portuguese</hi> buy
Slaves for little, that selling them to the <hi>Moors</hi> and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel
Merchants, they may get by 'em, which is done to the great
Dammage of their Souls, they being easily to be Converted
to the Faith, we command you to employ all your power for
the preventing so great an evil, by hindring such Sales, for the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57115:38"/>
great service which by it is done to God, and you will do to us,
if with the rigor the case requires, you remedy a thing which
appears so foul to us. You are to take care for the curbing the
excessive liberty of some Usurers, who as we are inform'd, are
amongst you under the protection of an old Law of <hi>Goa,</hi>
which we do at this present, and you are also to revoke, taking
it away from the Body of the rest, as contrary to Christian
Religion; you are to give order for the speedy Building a
Church in <hi>Bacaim,</hi> which is to be Dedicated to St. <hi>Joseph,</hi>
and upon our account to assign it rent for a Rector, some
Beneficiaries, and Chaplains who may officiate there; and
because the Preachers, and Ministers of our Faith, by going
about to Convert the <hi>Pagans,</hi> are in Necessity, we think it
fitting, and 'tis our will to give 'em something towards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying
their Charges, and only for that you are to lay a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Tax of three thousand Pardaos on all the Mosques the
<hi>Moors</hi> have in our Territories. You shall too out of our
Customs and Rights for ever give three hundred Bushels of
Rice for the maintenance of those whom the Vicar <hi>Miguel
Vaz</hi> either hath or shall Convert about <hi>Chaul,</hi> which quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
we order to be put into the Bishops hands, that he (as
he sees necessity) may distribute it. We have too been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
that about <hi>Cochim,</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Christians are
cheated in their weights and measures by our Merchants
who sell Pepper there, and that they take from 'em the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plusage
they (according to an old Custom) ought to have over
and above the just weight, and measure, whom for many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
'twere better to favour then oppress; for that end
you are to give order, they may enjoy their old Customs; you
are also to treat with the King of <hi>Cochim,</hi> that he cause to
be tane away certain <hi>Pagan</hi> Rites and Superstitions which
his South-sayers use to practice in the sale of Pepper, his
advantage by 'em being very little, and the Scandal to the
<hi>Christians</hi> who contract there very great; and because we
have been advis'd of the Cruelty <hi>that</hi> King useth against
those <hi>Indians</hi> who receive our Faith, by seising on their
Estates, you must zealously endeavour the said Kings (to
whom we have writ about it) leaving that so Barbarous
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57115:38"/>
cruelty, which so much injures the Souls and Bodies of his
Subjects, which, being our Friend, he will do; you on your
part employing that care we charge you with. For that,
which by your Letters and Advises we have, concerning the
delivering the people of <hi>Socotora</hi> from the miserable Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
in which they Live, we are of opinion so to remedy it,
that the <hi>Turk</hi> (whose Subjects they are) shall not with his
Fleets infest those Seas, you are to look how that is most
conveniently to be done by the advice of the Vicar <hi>Miguel
Vaz,</hi> whose Experience, both in that and all other business
of moment that shall occurr, will very much help you. We
know that those who Fish for Pearl, besides other wrongs
and oppressions they lye under, suffer in their Estates, our
Sea-Captains out of their little fear to God, forcing 'em on
very hard terms, only to Fish for them, upon which, (desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that none of our Subjects should suffer any Violence or
Oppression) we order you to see that those people be not so
hardly us'd, and that our Captains usurp not so unjust a
Power; and further, for the avoiding the like grievances
and cruelties you are to look if those Coasts be sufficiently
Guarded, and, if 'tis possible for us to recover our Dues
without having a Fleet there: and finding it Feasible, you are
to withdraw thence our Captains, commanding none to Sail
along those Coasts, by that means the Natives may enjoy their
Estates, and Cruelties and Extorsions be prevented; above
all we recommend to you the consulting with the Father
<hi>Francisco Xaverius</hi> in what ever occurs, chiefly what is to
be done for the encrease of Christianity on the Fishing Coast,
that those who are newly Converted may not be employed in
the Fishing, if they be, it may be upon knowledge that with
their new Religion they have got new Manners, and the great
abuses they use in it may be Curb'd. We have been likewise
inform'd, that those who from <hi>Paganism</hi> are Converted to
our holy Faith, are ill us'd and despis'd by their Kindred and
Friends, who, with so great Outrage and so high an Hand
banish 'em their Houses, and seize on their Estates, that they
are forc'd to Live miserably in great want and necessity;
that such things may be redress'd, you are (with the Counsel
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57115:39"/>
of the Vicar <hi>Miguel Vaz</hi>) to see they be reliev'd at our
Charge, putting, what is to be given 'em, in the hands of the
Rector who hath care of 'em, that he may every year distribute
it as is most convenient. We know too that from <hi>Ceilaon,</hi>
there came a youth to <hi>Goa,</hi> flying the fury and anger of his
Kindred, and being (as he is) of the Royal Family, that
he ought to succeed in the Kingdome, upon which, (for the
encouragement of those already, and those yet to be Converted)
we have thought good that you accommodate him (now he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christian) in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Colledge in the City, where, at our
Charge, such Lodgings, and necessaries may be provided him,
as are sit, not only for his maintenance, but pleasure, that our
Grandeur with Persons of his quality may be seen; besides,
you are to endeavour to clear his claim to the Kingdome; and
what you find in the business, send us with the proofs, that
we may according to conveniency provide; in the mean time
'tis our pleasure, that with all imaginable severity you call
the Tyrant to account for his Cruelties against those who are
Converted to our holy Faith; obliging him to give satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for so great insolence, that all the Princes of <hi>India</hi>
may see our love to Iustice, and how we put upon our own
score the protecting those who cannot help themselves. And
because, 'tis not fit <hi>Pagan</hi> Artificers should (as hitherto hath
been allow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d 'em) Cast, Paint, or Work any Images or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of our Lord Christ, or his Saints, to sell 'em; we
command you to use all diligence, for the hindring it, laying
Penalties, that he, who shall be prov'd to make any of the
fore-mention'd Images, shall (besides the having two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Drubbs) lose his Estate, because without doubt it looks
not well that Images representing so holy Mysteries should
pass through the hands of <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolaters. We have it
from the same hand, that the Churches newly begun to be
Built at <hi>Cochim,</hi> and <hi>Coulaon,</hi> want finishing, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
and expos'd to all the injuries of the Weather; which
is not only an ill sight, but prejudices the Building; you
shall therefore give Order, that (without sticking at the
charge) they may be gone on with, till Finish'd, by the work
and design of the best Architects and Overseers; you are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57115:39"/>
too, to cause a Church to be Built in <hi>Naraon,</hi> in Honour of,
and with the Dedication to, the Apostle Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and
to look to the finishing of that already begun in <hi>Calapor,</hi>
by the name of the holy Cross; you are too, to make another
in the Neighbouring Island of <hi>Coraon,</hi> for design and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
as you shall think convenient, there being nothing,
which, in the <hi>Pagans</hi> will more stirr up Devotion for the
matters of our holy Faith, then the affection they see on our
part. Besides which, we do more straightly charge you with
the founding Schools and Houses of Devotion, in all places
fit for't; whether, on certain Days, not only the <hi>Christians,</hi>
but <hi>Pagans</hi> may resort to Sermons, and Spiritual exercises,
that so they may come to the Love of our holy Faith, and the
Knowledge of the errors in which they Live, being illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
with the Light of the Gospel; for which you are to
choose Ministers with those parts such a Ministry requires.
And above all, earnestly desiring that the Name of God may
be known and worship't, and his holy Faith receiv'd in our
State, we will, and 'tis our pleasure, that in the Territories
of <hi>Salsete</hi> and <hi>Bardez</hi> all the Idols, and infernal Worship,
which hath hitherto been practis'd there, be utterly rooted out;
and that it may be done with the less difficulty, and without
the necessity of using any force or violence, we command
the Preachers in their Sermons and Disputations, to manage
the hearts of the <hi>Pagans</hi> with such prudence and zeal, that
(by God's blessing) they may be sensible of the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
them, by bringing 'em to the knowledge of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and delivering 'em from the miserable servitude of the
Devil in which they are, out of which, they only are to be
freed by closing with our holy Faith, the sole way to know
that blindness in which Satan leads 'em, not to consider how
much the Salvation of their Souls concerns 'em; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it very much imports this business, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of it be Men of a good Life and Conversation, and
able Scholars, you are to pick out such, from whom we may
expect the Effect we desire, and to recommend to 'em the care
and diligence requisite on their part; and on yours, you are
to endeavour the drawing of, and favouring all men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57115:40"/>
the Nobility and Great ones, (whose example the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

Faith, the difficulty will be but little to Convert the common
people, who will immediately be doing, what they see done

more may be wonn) having favour shew'd 'em, not only in
the general, but in their particulars, be they never so poor
and miserable. Of all this, we thought fit to inform you,
that, for the confidence we have of your care and diligence,
you might remedy all, from which, great Glory will result to
our Lord God; and we will reckon it to you as a peculiar

as his being always in Arms would permit him;
for the time of his Government was one continued
Battail, and the Souldiers, by the Licence of VVarr,
were readier to ruine the Laws, then reform their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
yet will the History shew us no slight Arguments
of his Zeal, recompens't extraordinarily by Heaven
with signs and miracles, one of 'em, which hapned in
the <hi>Molucca</hi>'s, (annex'd to his Government,) I'le relate
with my Customary brevity.</p>
            <p>71. The light of the Gospel had shin'd in those I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slands;
(Saint <hi>Francisco Xaverio</hi> as a faithfull Labourer
in the Lord's Vineyard, having in a great part clear'd
those places of the Thistles and Briars of Infidelity)
though we owe the first Cultivating to that great
<hi>Portuguese Antonio Galvaon,</hi> the most Couragious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and Zealous Apostle of those <hi>Pagans,</hi> whose
Prowess was answered by its Fruits in the wonderfull
Conversion of Souls, who with their Baptism re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the easie Yoak of Christ, the Princes and great
Ones, as well as the People, being all Tunable to the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57115:40"/>
Obedience of the Gospel. The Devil perceiving that,

               </note> a Light appear'd from
Heaven discovering the ways of Life, arm'd against the
innocent <hi>Christians</hi> a <hi>Pagan</hi> thereabouts call'd <hi>Tolon,</hi>
who had usurp't the Island of <hi>Moro.</hi> He with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Zeal began to persecute the new Converts,
forcing them by new Torments to turn <hi>Renegados</hi> from
that Faith they had profest; for which, many chose to
shed their Blood in a happy Martyrdome, others of
weaker Faith yielded to the Torments. The Tyrants
boldness encreasing to the Affronting of our Arms,
oblig'd 'em out of obedience to the Faith, and for the
service of the State, to Chastise that Idolater. The
persecuted, and fearfull, came with complaints to the
<hi>Portuguese,</hi> in <hi>Ternate,</hi> who resolving to bring down
the Infidel, with more zeal then strength went to find
him out at his own Home. Their motion could not be
so secret, but the Tyrant had notice of it; who, by
fortifying the entrance of the Island with Trenches and
strong Barricados, provided for his Defence; and in
case our men should get those, he had strew'd Splinters
and long poyson'd Crows-feet in all the Avenues
which led to the City, o're which, whilst ours in the
heat of Anger, and Victory, past, they must necessarily
lose themselves. It hapned, that after winning the first
Stacade, (which the Infidels probably quitted without
any hot dispute, in confidence of their second Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem)
whilst ours, baited with the flight of the Enemy,
were incautelously passing on, there fell on a suddain,
(a thing miraculous) such a quantity of Ashes from the
Sky as made ours stop, till, after the Air was clear'd,
they pursu'd their Victory over the Crows-feet, where
the Ashes had made the way hard and sure; so the
astonish't Infidels afterwards related it, making use of
the Miracle, for an argument of the truth of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
they persecuted.</p>
            <p>72. Thus did <hi>Asia</hi> yield to the Faith and the State
in the time of <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro,</hi> who had in one hand
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57115:41"/>
the Gospel, in the other a Sword, and fill'd the <hi>East</hi> with
the discourse of so great an Action, as was, the Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
undergoing a Warr for the defence of <hi>Meale,</hi> a

Obedience, and the Princes his Allies their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>73. <hi>Asia</hi> gave him but little time of rest in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of his Victories, <hi>Cambaya</hi> beginning immediately
to rouse him with the Alarums of a new Warr; the
noise of it was already in the States intelligence; but
being the most notable piece of our History, we will

in his History.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> was by Nation an <hi>Albanese,</hi> and the
Child of <hi>Catholick</hi> Parents,<note place="margin">What <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> was.</note> though the Fruit degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the Stock. He had serv'd some time in the
Warrs of <hi>Italy,</hi> more taken notice of for a brave, then
a Souldier; in all Mutinies and Tumults, pick't out as
the worst; for some years he led this loose Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
either reward, or punishment; untill, like a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
man, who had rather seek then expect his Fortune,
he chang'd his Profession; of a Souldier becoming a
Merchant, for being Cunning and Covertous, this was
the nearest and surest way to what he aim'd. He begun
in a little time, (knowing the opportunity and seasons
of Commerce) to grow great by his business, being at
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57115:42"/>
once Liberal, and Covetous, for his own ends cunningly
making use of both Vice and Vertue. His Stock and
Credit was at last so considerable, as Trading up and
down the <hi>Streights,</hi> with three small Vessels of his own,
of different Lading, he was met with by <hi>Rox Solyman,</hi>
Admiral for the <hi>Soldan</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> who Boarded him,
made him yield, and took what he had. The Prize was
greater then the Victory, and <hi>Solyman</hi> for the credit of
his own reputation, treated him Honourably, presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him to the <hi>Soldan</hi> as a Prisoner of Quality, valuing
more his Person then his Booty. <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> began to
be as content with his misfortune, as if it had been of
his own seeking; He was experienc't Souldier enough
by his Service in the Armies in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> He
spoke of the Forces of the <hi>Christians</hi> with malice and
undervaluing, as if intending to teach the <hi>Soldan</hi> to
know his own strength. The <hi>Soldan</hi> was by these Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ices
brought to look on the Slave as capable of great
things, and begun first out of curiosity to listen to
him; afterwards out of affection. <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> with so
sly a flattery commended what ere he did, well, or ill,
as it past but for freedome, because making a shew to
be only zealous, not acceptable, he kept to himself, the
<hi>Soldan</hi>'s favour, and avoided all publick honours more
out of cautiousness then modesty. He came to be
Treasurer of <hi>Cairo,</hi> a place of very great trust, which
he manag'd with prudence, and fidelity, Vertues so
pris'd by the <hi>Soldan,</hi> as if not till then known amongst
the Infidels. At the Councels of Warr his Vote weigh'd
most, sometimes for his experience, sometimes for the
reason of it; in all designs against the <hi>Christians,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in those which were to be carry'd on by others,
He declar'd his sence with a great deal of confidence,
and by this means grew so great that he could not bear
his own Fortune, till, not minding the preserving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by the same Arts he was advanc't, his Ambition and
Pride burst forth; He possest what places he could, and
more sollicitously look't after Preferments then Friends,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57115:43"/>
whose help or company he now Valew'd not, he desir'd
to be known, only for the <hi>Soldan</hi>'s Slave, and for Master
of the rest. He plotted the Destruction of the great
Ones on publick pretensions, as if he aim'd that two
only were to Govern, till the <hi>Moors,</hi> wearied of so base
a patience, began publickly to complain and disturb
the <hi>Soldan</hi>'s inclinations to favour <hi>Coge-Sofar,</hi> they
very feelingly acquainted him with their grievances,
saying, they might now be very well excus'd from set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out Galleys against the <hi>Christians,</hi> if their Slaves
were to be made their Master, when <hi>Turks</hi> of the best
quality were by the <hi>Christians</hi> so cruelly us'd, as to go
up and down <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> dragging their Chains
after 'em, and had their Faces stigmatis'd with infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Letters, in token of their Captivity, that 'twas not
to be born for so many great Bashaws to receive Laws
from a despicable Slave; that, though every day they
with their eyes saw their own Outrages, they could not
disgest those which were offered to their Prophet, by
a vile, irreverent and haughty <hi>Christian,</hi> not so much
as going into their Mosques; that now nothing more
was to be done then the setting up Crosses in the streets
of <hi>Cairo,</hi> and commanding 'em to be ador'd.</p>
            <p>5. These things were said with so much freedome,
as they look't more like conspiracy then complaint, and
with particular grievances involving the cause of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
(which ordinarily carries with it, its own Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and the affections of the People) were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
listned to by the <hi>Soldan,</hi> who put <hi>Coge Sofar</hi> out
of his Office, with command to change his Religion;
so frail do even the greatest Favourites find their Princes
favour.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> seeing himself falln, put on again his
first Humility, and those Artifices the necessity of the
times taught him, and having now only the name and
memory of a Christian, easily chang'd, for the Poyson
of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> Evangelical Salvation, quitting the name
given him in Baptism for that of <hi>Coge-Sofar,</hi> by which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57115:43"/>
we before hand call'd him, not knowing the first he had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> being a <hi>Mahomitan,</hi> began to winn upon the
<hi>Moors</hi> in their confidence in him; healing by gifts the
hatred of those who envy'd him; by his new Apostacy,
(by which he Cancel'd the suspition of his fidelity)
the malice of the people; carrying on his designs with a
more sly ambition, which made him more affable to his
Enemies then to Strangers; but knowing the <hi>Soldan</hi>'s
Fickleness,<note place="margin">How he come to <hi>Cambaya.</hi>
               </note> fearing too a second complaint, not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on reconcil'd favour as secure, He treacherously one
night Kill'd his mortal enemy <hi>Rox Solyman</hi> and his
Son, and putting together all the Jewels and Money
he could, went away secretly for the Service of the King
of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> of whose Grandeur and Liberality he had
had full information, and how he valew'd Strangers,

he came almost to engross <hi>Badur</hi>'s favour, being
his Companion in his Victories and Losses, being in the
last which befell him at his Death. So that now grown
by the King's bounty, to be in Power and Authority
the greatest Subject, holding also with <hi>Mahumed</hi> Heir
of the Crown the same repute, for the reasons we have
already related, and to deserve the favour of the new
Prince, by the love and fidelity he shew'd to the Ashes
of him who was Dead, he urg'd him to revenge <hi>Badur</hi>'s
Death; 'tis reported, that he spoke to this purpose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King and Nobility of <hi>Cambaya.</hi>

            <p>7. <q>The favours which for ten years I receiv'd of
<hi>Sultan Badur</hi> (for which those abroad admired his
Grandeur, those at home envy'd my Fortune) are
known to every one. He cast his Eyes upon me, and
like a Vapour rais'd me from the ground, preferring
me, a Stranger, and a Vagabond, before those who
were born in his Palace; of a Subject he treated me
like a Friend, and lov'd me as a Son. From this most
Gracious Prince, (whose Ashes I reverence as my Lords,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57115:44"/>
and weep o're as my Fathers) have the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
under the sacred shew of peace ta'ne away his Life,
to the great Scandal of all other Kings, and no less
Outrage of his Subjects, unworthy to have been so,
to so mighty a Prince, since we so insensibly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully
behave our selves; Feeding at our own
home the Murderers of our Monarck, who enjoy, as
Inheritance, a place, which by so hainous an offence
they made their own, lately Strangers, now Patrons.
You! Oh Prince, Heir and Lord of this Empire, see
your Subjects every day receive Laws from these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulters,
'tis for you to decide, whom we are first to
Obey, our King, or our Enemies; their boldness will

venture to look upon that so reserv'd Empire, which
never admitted of a Trade with Strangers; there
they Built the famous City of <hi>Macao,</hi> whence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57115:46"/>
the Mysteries of their Faith into the <hi>Chinese,</hi>
making their Trade a step to their Religion; from
hence they Rove amongst the numberless Islands of
<hi>Iapaon,</hi> visiting <hi>Tava, Timor, Borneo, Banda, Maluco,</hi>
and <hi>Lequios,</hi> so as the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Ships with a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Sailing Coast the greatest part of the World for
the space of more then nine thousand Leagues, to so
difficult a Voyage animated by their Ambition, and
guided by their Fortune. I have tediously run o're
all the Coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> where by the influence of
Power or Trade the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Arms have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
known, because the World doth, from such
scattered Conquests, falsly conclude their Power, and
I their Weakness; for <hi>Portugall,</hi> being a small King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
furthest <hi>West,</hi> and in continual Warr with their
Neighbour <hi>Africa,</hi> where they consume themselves
both by what they Winn or Lose, their Fights, and
Garrisons being always an expence of men, not being
able to stay where they were Born, in hatred of the
Soil and Clime which gave them a beeing, they go
Roving up and down the World, as if Men, Land
and Winds were theirs; I now leave it to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the most ordinary understanding, how little
so divided a strength is to be fear'd, which in their
Prosperity will be spent by their Victories; what
cause have we to dread the Government of these Mad
men, who with one Arm in <hi>Asia,</hi> and the other in the
<hi>West,</hi> strive to grasp the World? they have in <hi>India</hi>
many Princes under 'em, but not one Friend, they all
adore and hate their Rulers, because the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
made peace with none but after Victories, and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages,
so as not their affections, but their wrongs
unite 'em, and they all do Homage while they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
offend. But what will it be when they shall see
<hi>Soltan Mahamud</hi> take the Field with an Army? what
doubt is there but that all the Injur'd will be our
Souldiers? by force of Arms they have made many
Kings Tributary, and supposing they now are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57115:46"/>
by them, a good turn is sooner forgot then an
injury. The Grand <hi>Signor Selim,</hi> sees the Wounds
his <hi>Ianizaries</hi> receiv'd at <hi>Dio,</hi> yet gaping, and one so
little us'd to receive affronts will not let slip the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of revenging the first, by beginning the
Warr, or seconding you in it, who is ambitious also
of having the greatest part of the World under his
Empire. The <hi>Samorim</hi> hath not one Port, which since
the <hi>Portuguese</hi> came into the <hi>East,</hi> hath not been the
Theatre of their Victories, and scarce hath he one
Subject who hath not been wounded by their Swords.
<hi>Hidalcaon</hi> sees every day his Territories of <hi>Bardez</hi> and
<hi>Salsete</hi> running with Blood, and when the Governour
made an unjust Warr against him, he brought <hi>Meale</hi>
to <hi>Goa</hi> to countenance, by his pretended justice to an
another, the ruining him; all the other Princes will
take Arms against the common Enemy, that they
may enjoy the antient Liberty they liv'd in. For my
part I offer my Children, my Estate, and my Person
towards this VVarr; if I fall in it, <hi>Badur</hi> by my Blood
shall see my Loyalty, and be the success good or
bad, I shall not count Death less Honourable, then
Victory.</q>

commits to him (as to one who out-went all the rest
in his Zeal, and Conduct) the design: He immediately
quickens the preparations by diverse messages to the
Neighbouring Kings, putting them in mind of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
had been put upon 'em, and offering them his
Princes arms in favour of their grievances. He dispach't
Embassadours to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> inviting the <hi>Turk</hi> to
redeem the credit of his Arms by beating the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
out of <hi>India,</hi> a thing which as much concern'd their
Religion, as Policy; He made way for the Succour he
ask't of him, with a present of so great Value, as 'twas
more likely to stirr up the <hi>Turks</hi> ambition against his

Riches, then that he should send him Auxiliary Forces

            <p>11. The <hi>Molucco</hi>'s were many years under the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of our Laws, Discovered and Conquer'd by the
Arms of this Crown, which were the first of <hi>Europe</hi>
came to those Islands, assign'd to us by the partition the

amongst others King and Lord of the chief Islands of

Dy'd without any Heir, in <hi>Molucco;</hi> and out of Gratitude,

the King <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> the third, Heir of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the <hi>Molucco</hi>'s, to be successively annex't to the

opinion of the best Lawyers and Geographers) to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. The Governour <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi> found in <hi>Goa

               <note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour gives 'em to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chil Aeyro.</hi>
               </note> one of great Power in the <hi>Molucco</hi>'s;
who had for his Service deserv'd well of the State, and

Prince <hi>Dom Manoel,</hi> but, by many accidents so poor,
as he came to <hi>India</hi> to recommend himself to our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
The Governour, thinking his misfortunes not
deserv'd by his Blood, (believing too that the memory
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57115:48"/>
of our Kings would be more honour'd by giving away,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 1. Cap. 4.</note>

of the <hi>Molucco</hi>'s, with this caution, that in him, and
his Posterity, the exercise of the Regality should depend
on <hi>Portugall.</hi> Amongst the Kings of <hi>India,</hi> some, made
so great a gift a piece of Prodigality, others of Pride,
but all stood amaz'd that we should take so much pains
for what we gave away so easily.</p>

<hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi>'s time, who sent <hi>Fernaon de Sousa
de Tavora</hi> to the <hi>Molucco</hi>'s to dislodge the <hi>Castilians,</hi>
who, invited by the Plenty and Richness of the Soil,
had a mind to enjoy the Fruits of other mens Labours,
and disturb the Peace, and Trade of those Islands, to
which, by Conquest and Inheritance, we had a double
Title.<note place="margin">Who was their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.</note> 
               <hi>Ruy Lopez de Villalobos,</hi> a man more wary then
Valiant was Commander of the <hi>Castilians,</hi> he had
proudly boasted of the strength of the Emperour Charls
the Fifth his Master, and, of the advantage, which
from his Friendship those <hi>Pagan</hi> Kings might receive in
their Warrs and Trade, had too handled the report of
us with a great deal of Disparagement; and, (things
hop't for, being in the opinion of men, greater then
those at present) some of the Islands listned to the
<hi>Castilian,</hi> pleading for it, either sleight or forgotten
Grievances.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>Fernaon de Sousa,</hi>

Friends; that he was to consider, Peace with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
more concern'd <hi>Portugall</hi> then the Cloves of the

might prove like Mines, which often play a great way

               </note> 
               <hi>Fernaon de Sousa</hi>'s answer was, that he was
but a little man, but as short in his Resolution as his
Stature; that those Islands were his Masters the King of
<hi>Portugall;</hi> that he was able with the same Sword which
got 'em to defend 'em; that he very well knew him to
be a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and a <hi>Catholick,</hi> but that being so, did
not warrant him to take away his Cloak; that the
Emperour would not make Warr with <hi>Portugall</hi> before
first reading in the Chronicles of <hi>Castile,</hi> how it far'd
with his Predecessors; that what he was to do, was, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to embarque for <hi>India,</hi> or put himself with his men

Shipping for <hi>Spain.</hi>

Cure the distemper, and, neither able to resist

their Princes how things stood, and they make an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modement
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57115:49"/>
of this affair; for, if before employing that
diligence there should be any Blood shed, it would lye
upon both the Kings to revenge their Subjects injuries;
that there were betwixt <hi>Portugall</hi> and <hi>Castile</hi> many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
and grievances which Peace cover'd; that he
was not desirous to revive that Fire which was Buried
in the Ashes of a long <hi>Amnesty;</hi> that if the <hi>Castilians</hi>
went away with complaints in their Mouths, their own
injuries might easily bring them back again; that,
though broken with the Sea, and their Sufferings, if
oblig'd to unreasonable conditions, their own Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
would inspirit 'em, with more vigor then their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
necessity.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>Fernaon de Sousa,</hi> by the intrigues of this Letter,

(the day appointed for the <hi>Castilians</hi> to come to our

he could, to shew the Pleasure with which he
expected his Guests, whom he went out to Sea to seek,
which when <hi>Ruy Lopez</hi> was advis'd of, he sent off a
Boat from shore, desiring him to put off the business till
the next day, for he was then encountring with some
difficulties, which from him he should be acquainted
with.<note place="margin">What <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naon de Sousa</hi> doth in the business.</note> 
               <hi>Fernaon de Sousa,</hi> taking this delay to be design,
and that the <hi>Castilian</hi> kept not touch with him, and
receiving the message at Sea, commanded his men to
Row, and with more passion then prudence went alone
amongst the <hi>Castilians; Ruy de Lopez</hi> saw it, and with
a Guard of fourscore Musquetiers came to wait for him
at the Sea-side, whence carrying him to his Lodgings,
told him what a Tumult had hapned amongst his men,
for <hi>Dom Alonso Henriquez,</hi> Captain of a Ship, cloaking
his own interest with the zeal of serving his Prince,
refus'd to stand to the agreement, and had about him
(who upheld his party) his Friends and some muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Persons, possessing the King of <hi>Tidore</hi> and others
with extravagant Jealousies thereby to encrease his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57115:50"/>
Faction, calling his Sedition, Zeal, and the Generals
moderation, Cowardise, for delivering up the Arms
and Banners of <hi>Spain,</hi> which with his Life he had sworn
to Defend, and depriving the Emperour of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of such plentifull Islands, and the poor Souldiers
of the fruit and reward of so dangerous a Voyage; that
the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> a proud Nation, and always Cross to
theirs, would Laugh at our so tame a surrender: But
that he knew all that bravery to be falsly grounded, for
'twas neither the service of <hi>Cesar,</hi> nor the love of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which mov'd 'em, but the desire of the Cloves,
of which they had gather'd great quantities, and could
not trust us, that we would let 'em carry to <hi>Spain</hi> the
news of that Commodity, whose worth would pay 'em
for all the dangers and troubles they had run through;
<hi>Fernaon de Sousa</hi> and the rest, (who said as he did)
hearing this, as to that particular, took off their fears,

any Jealousie in so young a friendship, but now, when
so many years Peace had carry'd away any unjust affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
'twas fit to satisfie the people who desir'd that
separation, as a mark of the Liberty they liv'd in; that
when on that side we sleighted the Wall of the City,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57115:50"/>
'twas out of Anger, and the liberty of Victory, and the
Inhabitants could not endure to be every day minded
of their Ignominy by so scornfull a Memorial; that
when no Symptoms of hatred were in their minds, 'twas
not well to preserve them in scattered stones; that we
being but strangers in <hi>Dio,</hi> 'twas not for us to give Laws
like Masters; that the <hi>Citizens</hi> would take it very ill
that what their Kings allow'd 'em, their Neighbours
should take away; that we ought from others Subjects
to seek for Friendship, not Obedience; that the <hi>Sultan</hi>
had given him that City, which he resolv'd to enlarge
with new Inhabitants, who should see that Fortress was
not a Bridle, but a Defence to those who Liv'd there;
that 'twas but fit the <hi>Portuguese</hi> should give the people
all possible satisfaction to secure a Peace founded on
oppression.</p>
            <p>22. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> by this Letter perceiv'd
that <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> sought for pretences to break, for, to

deny it, justify'd the Warr; whereupon he answered
him,<note place="margin">The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</note> that in so well grounded a Peace as was 'twixt
<hi>Mahumud</hi> and the State, 'twould be more secure to

the Wall would neither endanger us nor secure them;
that 'twixt the Fortress and the City there was an other

Loyalty of the <hi>Portuguese;</hi> that he gave him joy of
his new Seigniory, that he might reckon on the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese</hi>

was to be referr'd to the Governour of <hi>India,</hi>
who was setting out a Fleet to come and Visit the
Fortress; that upon his arrival he would acquaint him
with his proposition; and immediately advis'd the
Governour how things stood,<note place="margin">and advice to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</note> who by the Envoys he

whom you see besieg'd within those Walls;
for though Souldiers, yet are they not more then men.
Fortune hath hitherto, bore 'em company, or serv'd
'em all over the <hi>East;</hi> and the Fame of their first
Victories hath help't 'em to the rest. VVith a few
men they make VVarr upon the whole VVorld; and
by the course of things, an Empire (kept up only in
the Opinion, or by the weakness of the Conquer'd)
cannot last, without Forces; they have scarce five
hundred men in the Fortress, most of whom are Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
Souldiers, who of custom use to be the poorest,
or most useless; by Land they can have no relief,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57115:54"/>
what is to be had by Sea, the Winter cuts off; they
want, by the security of their Peace, or Pride, (out
of which they despis'd every thing) Ammunition and
Provisions: being but few, the same men must always
be upon that VVall, not having one Souldier in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
to supply an others place; they have not
Pioneers to repair the Breaches of our Batteries, and
their Duty amongst so few must necessarily make 'em
yield; they are insolent upon the Dammage they did
the Grand <hi>Signior</hi>'s Galleys at the siege of the same
Fortress; it concerns so many honourable <hi>Turks,</hi> and
Valiant <hi>Ianizaries</hi> as are here to go on, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of your Nation and Empire, as the most justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
cause of this VVarr; for though <hi>Cambaya</hi> hath
Armies and Souldiers, 'tis not for the Grand <hi>Signior</hi>'s
repute, with Forein force, to revenge his injuries. I
therefore put you upon this design, that none else
might Rob you of the glory of so just vengeance;
this same Ground you now tread upon, covers the
Bones of your Comrades, Kindred, and Friends, who
(me-thinks call upon every one of us by Name) tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

<hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> return'd answer,<note place="margin">The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains answer.</note> that, friendly

fright us, for Renown is not to be purchas'd by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
dangers; we have Sail'd five thousand Leagues
only to find out this Day, and in it to gain that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
neither Kings or Countries can give us; for
Kings give Rewards, not Deserts; we want not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
or Ammunition to hold out the Siege till Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
arrives, and though in this Season the Seas are
high, yet have we a <hi>Iohn de Castro</hi> (who with his
Sword in his mouth will come under the Waves to
help us) and so many other Gentlemen and Persons
of Quality who will think themselves injur'd if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them we gain the honour which is before us;
after which we are not to look for any thing more
from Fortune, being to be put on their List who
have memorably serv'd their King and Country, for
the keeping up of whose Honour we are come from
farthest West-ward thus remote; and (what's above
all) we Fight against the Enemies of our Faith, and
in so just a cause cannot want owning, since we serve
the God of Victories.</q>

            <p>34. When the Speech was ended, there was in the
<hi>Turks</hi> Camp heard a great Shooting, by which <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi>
welcom'd a Relief of two thousand Foot, which
were come to him from <hi>Cambaya,</hi> all old Souldiers,
who made the succour more considerable by its quality,
then number; there came with these two of the
<hi>Mogull</hi>'s Commanders, Persons very much Cry'd up by
their own men. The same day there came in a great
part of the Nobility from the Court, which at some

distance from the Leaguere, Lodg'd themselves in Rich
Tents,<note place="margin">There comes in more Relief to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> with such Order, as wanted nothing of the
Discipline of <hi>Europe;</hi> Our men, by not valuing their
Lives, put off the Terrour of such great preparations,
encouraging one the other by Discourses suitable to the
occasion, taking Counsel of their necessity how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themselves.</p>
            <p>35. The next day (which was Maunday Thursday
in the year 1546.)<note place="margin">They begin to batter the fort.</note> there appear'd betimes in the
Morning near our Fortress a solid work of Earth, with
its Skit-gates, and in them some great Pieces, and on top
of the work a great many Sacks of Cotton, cover'd with
Raw hides to resist the Fire, a thing, which for the little
noise and time it was contriv'd in, much startled our
men, and did not look like the design of a Confus'd
and Barbarous multitude, who, whilst the Siege lasted,
shew'd as much Valour, as Discipline; they presently
began, with a great deal of success, to batter our Fort,
dismounting four of our Gunns, which did the greatest
Dammage to their Battery.</p>
            <p>36. That days good fortune Counsell'd 'em for the
rest,<note place="margin">A Stratagem of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in a Ship.</note> making in five Nights as many Forts, at a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
distance, to give by the several Breaches a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
assault, which so few Defendants so divided would
not be able to withstand; the success might have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
the design, had not our Fort which lay on the
Sea, and commanded theirs, done 'em so much harm,
that they thought fit to look to their own Reparations
before our Offence; the great Gunns were silent for
two days, in which they contriv'd a second Fabrick to
secure their first.<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 1. Cap. 8.</note> They put to Sea a Tall Ship, full of
Powder, Stone-pitch, and other Combustible matter,
this they laid on the first Deck, as a Stratagem prepar'd
for a second design, over this they made a false Deck,
capable of two hundred Fighting men, as if with them
designing to Scale: The Ship so lay, as to command
that part of the Fort, whether, they concluded, our
men upon their advantage of place to Fight on, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57115:57"/>
numbers, would probably come, when in the heat of
the Conflict, quitting the Ship, they would set her on
Fire, which lighting on the Fort, might burn it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Dammage or Danger to their own men; and
that presently entring on the ruins the Fire had left,
they would on them cast up an other, whence they
might batter our Fortress, and by this new work secure
their former, and so their Gunns play securely. A Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
grounded on Soldier-like conclusions.</p>
            <p>37. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> had (by some Spies he
had in the Camp) notice of the <hi>Machine</hi> and design,
and calling to him <hi>Iacome Leyte,</hi> Commander at Sea, a
Souldier of great trust, told him he would not Rob
him of the honour belong'd to his employment; that
he thought the first Atchievement of this Siege ought
to be his, and acquainting him with the advice he had,
gave him Orders to be ready in the second VVatch.
<hi>Iacome Leyte</hi> put to Sea at the hour appointed in two
Boats with thirty Souldiers, and Rowing quietly till
he came up with the Ship, began to cast in her a great
many Pots of Powder.<note place="margin">Set on Fire by our men,</note> The <hi>Moors</hi> at once saw their
danger, and the Fire burning 'em, and running to their
Arms, distracted by fear and sleep, did faintly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly
defend themselves, hindring one an other by the
Noise and Tumult so unexpected an Onset had caus'd:
some began to throw themselves into the Sea, who
shew'd the way and example to the rest; at last, with
Complaints and Clamors they left the Ship, giving the
Alarum to the whole Camp. <hi>Iacome Leyte</hi> had time
enough to make fast a Cable to the Ship, and tow her
after his;<note place="margin">and brought to the Fort.</note> The Captain receiv'd him with Praises and
Embraces, making more of this success, because it so
happily began the Warr. The <hi>Moors,</hi> though with
eminent danger, continued their Battering, for every
stone they unloosned of the Fortress, paying Souldiers,
and Canoneers, their Battery did no considerable harm,
only Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s Bastion, being the weakest or the
most Batter'd, was open in two places, and the Breaches
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57115:58"/>
wide enough to enter upon assault; though those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
defended themselves with Retrenchments, and by
Night stole Earth to make up the Breaches.</p>
            <p>38. The Battery continued not without Execution,
the Wall being in many places open, every where shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and not a Souldier could peep through the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements,
who was not peirc't with the Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
or wounded with their Shot, which was so thick
as it appear'd to be a continual Discharging, <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi>
little valuing the spending Ammunition, or venturing
Soldiers, as being sufficiently furnish't and stock't with
both; He was too, answered by our Gunns from the
Fortress, and with more Dammage, for the <hi>Moors</hi> being
in multitudes, not a Bullet was spent in vain.</p>
            <p>39. The <hi>Turks</hi> were earnest to go on upon the
Assault, because in many places the Battery had done
Dammage enough to scale the Wall, yet did <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi>
keep them off, expecting more Force, or willing by
continual Duty and Wounds to abate the height of
our men, whose eagerness he hop't by slow Fighting to
tame, and waste the Forces, Ammunitions, and Patience
of the Besieged; an Argument not altogether out of
the way, for the Winter, which had begun furiously,
took away the possibility of that succour which was
necessary, and wanted from the first day, for the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
of Peace and suddain invasion of the Enemy had
made ours unprovided to endure the weight of that
Warr, their confidence in that kind being so extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
that since the siege <hi>Antonio da Sylveira</hi> held out,
the place was only kept by the repute of that Victory;
and <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> had no more then forty
Barrils of Powder for Canon, and twenty for Musquets,
scarcity of Provisions, as well as of Men, who saw the
VVarr before they expected it, the Defendants were
but two hundred, most of them Garrison-Souldiers,
who were to have their first credit by that Siege.</p>
            <p>40. The Captain was not a little troubled at the
State of things, and the uncertainty of relief, which, it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57115:58"/>
concern'd him as cautiously to keep from his own as the
Enemy, neither would he in the beginning of the Siege
stint the Provision, and Ammunition, seeing, one way,
the ill consequence,<note place="margin">

               </note> the other, the necessity of doing
it; when the VVatch came to tell him there appear'd
nine Sail, which seem'd by their Built to be Ours, the
transport of this News brought all the Souldiers on the
VVall.<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Cap. 9. Lib. 1.</note> The distance, and closeness of the VVeather
made them of different Opinions, but within an hour
they made the Colours of the Squadron, and presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Admiral with the King's Arms, which by contrary
VVinds was working it up towards our Fortress; they
all had their Pendants flying, and Flaggs of defiance
in the main top; they immediately saluted the Towers,
who return'd them the same Sea-civility. The <hi>Moors</hi>
from the Shore made many a Shot at them whilst they
cast Anchor; They first unladed the Ammunition and
Provision, afterwards the Souldiers, and last of all
<hi>Dom Fernando</hi> went on shore, which was either the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
advice, or the Sons gallantry.</p>
            <p>41. The Commander in chief, having receiv'd those
Gentlemen as Companions of his Fortune, knowing of
<hi>Dom Fernando</hi>'s coming, went to seek him on Board, and
met him on the steps of the Fortress as he was coming
up, he took him in his Arms, and spake to him as time
and place requir'd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> receives him.</note> offering him his own Lodging,
which <hi>Dom Fernando</hi> would not accept, desiring him to
reserve that honour till they had Peace; that for the
present, that part of the works where was the greatest
danger should be his Chamber; that his Sleep would
do him no good, one step from the Wall; <hi>Dom Iohn
Mascarenhas</hi> again embrac't him, wondring, in so Green
years, to meet so Manly a temper.</p>
            <p>42. There came in the Ships good store of Powder,
Arms, and Provision, with which they might hold out
the Siege till fresh Relief; neither did the Governour
forget to send Physick and Regallos for the Sick and
Wounded. The Commander shew'd the Souldiers the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57115:59"/>
Governours Letter, in which (as we said) he secur'd
him of his coming, for which he was providing with
the greatest diligence and strength the State was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, which put new hearts into the Besieged, and
made them look with an other Face upon the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and preparations of the Warr, which was like to
continue, <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> receiving every day supplies, and
laying new designs, for which he had from diverse places
brought Engineers, who were, by ambition and reward,
put upon new inventions, which made our men more
sollicitous for the danger they saw not, then for that
before 'em.</p>
            <p>43. The Governour,<note place="margin">

               </note> after having dispatch't his Son
<hi>Dom Fernando,</hi> gave Order for Proclaiming a Warr
at Fire and Sword against the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> as one
who was perjur'd, and had broke the Peace betwixt him
and the State: this he did with Warlike and Legal
solemnities, thereby to publish, and justifie the motives
of a Warr, which kept in suspence the judgments of the
whole <hi>East.</hi> He writ to the Inhabitants of <hi>Bacaim,</hi>
minding them, that as nearest, they were oblig'd to
succour <hi>Dio,</hi> that other places help't in the States dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
they in their own, the Gunns which battered <hi>Dio,</hi>
shaking the Houses of <hi>Bacaim;</hi> that he was providing
to go raise the Siege, and use all imaginable Hostility
against <hi>Cambaya,</hi> because the State never had a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
VVarr with the Kings of the <hi>East;</hi> that he desir'd
'em to be ready to accompany him with Ships and Men,
as was to be expected from so many Honourable <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi>
and Loyal <hi>Portuguese;</hi> that he left it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
what they would do for the Service, looking that
every one out of Loyalty and Love to his King, should
out-go his possibility.</p>
            <p>44. He writ in the same manner to all those places
from which he could receive any help, finding them
dispos'd to the Service, and for that to the spending their
Estates: an happiness which we must reckon upon as
peculiar in his Government, as on diverse occasions
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57115:59"/>
the History will shew. He fell upon providing the Fleet
with a great deal of earnestness,<note place="margin">He borrows of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</note> and finding the State
too poor for such an expence, ask't great summs of the
Merchants upon his word (which was the Gold and
Diamonds he only laid up) a Pawn on which all men
of Trading offer'd him what they had; I know not if
now amongst men of Power Estates of that nature go
currant for so much. He ordered publick and private
Prayers to be made,<note place="margin">He goes to God by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers</note> beseeching God, since t'was his
own, to protect the cause of the Faithfull, relying more
upon Sacrifice, then Arms; his ordinary discourse was
with Experienc't men about the business of <hi>Dio,</hi> and
was more inclin'd by the reason, then the authority of
the Votes.</p>
            <p>45. Our Arms in <hi>Dio</hi> did not grow rusty. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
having advice that there was expected to be
put into the Army a great Caravan of Provisions, which
were to be Laden on the Coast betwixt <hi>Balsar</hi> and
<hi>Damaon,</hi> upon it sent forth the Sea-Commander
<hi>Iacome Leyte</hi> with three Ships, to lye about the Island
<hi>Dos Mortos,</hi> who by Night getting over the Barr and
Sailing along the Shore,<note place="margin">They take a great deal of Provisions from the Enemy.</note> took by it a great many Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
which came to furnish the Army, he put the <hi>Moors</hi>
to the Sword except some he kept to hang at the Yards
Arms when he came over the Barr; which he did, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the Army with a Lamentable sight, who had
too the Confirmation of what had past by the Fire they
saw burning the Vessels, the Provisions were brought
into the Fortress, which were what they then most
wanted.</p>
            <p>46. <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> had already lost a great many men,
without seeing the Fortress or minds of the Besieged
shaken to flatter his hopes of getting it. Out men
walk't upon the VVall with wanton Ornaments and
Feathers, to shew their pleasure in, or contempt of the
VVarr they were engag'd in. <hi>Coge-Sofar,</hi> seeing us with
so inconsiderable a strength Masters at Sea, and that
the Provisions his Army had came by stealth or in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57115:60"/>
danger, ordered the setting out Fleet from <hi>Surrate,</hi>
which met with three Ships of ours coming from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caim</hi>
and <hi>Chaul</hi> to furnish the Fortress; the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
fought very desperately, but by the Odds of their
strength, most of them Dy'd, who sold their Life at such
a rate, that the <hi>Moors</hi> had no cause to rejoyce in either
the Prize or Victory. <hi>Dom Fernando de Castro</hi> ask't
leave of the Commander in Chief to go with some
Ships to their help, which he did not grant, knowing
'twould be labour lost, for the Enemy stole out and
presently retir'd.</p>
            <p>47. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> thought of advising the

over the deserts of <hi>Arabia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>48. <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> carry'd on his works with no less
danger then toil, and with so Cruel and Barbarous a
resoluteness, that he us'd the Bodies of those Pioneers

planted eighteen <hi>Basilisks,</hi> which plaid for a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
together, with so much Dammage, as our men
for their last remedy defended themselves with the very
ruins, making Forts retrenchments and reparations of
the stones which had been thrown down.</p>
            <p>49. We had now lost fourscore men, and had more
then an hundred VVounded, besides the scarcity and
badness of the Provisions had made many sick; most of
the Ammunition was spent, and by it our men brought
into a great deal of danger, which <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> having
notice of by some Slaves who run away from the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress,
ordered the Batteries should be re-inforc't, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

            <p>50. Our men believ'd that the Mirth in the Camp,
so Solemniz'd with repeated Vollees, was to welcome
those <hi>Turks</hi> they look't for; <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi>
presently commanded <hi>Fernaon Cavalho</hi> Commander of
the Fort next the Sea, to set out a little Boat to know
what past amongst the Enemy, (the Spies he had in
the Camp, being either Treacherous, or Discovered)
which was done that very Night, and a <hi>Moor</hi> brought
us, who told us of the <hi>Sultan</hi>

The Commander freed the <hi>Moor,</hi> and bid him from
him desire the King of <hi>Cambaya</hi> to stay in the Army, for
he hop't to come and Visit him in his quarters. The
<hi>Moor</hi> rejoyc't at his Liberty, and wondred at the

repeating the Captains words, he told him, the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese</hi>

had their Fort thrown down, and their Hearts

            <p>51. <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> commanded they should continue
Battering, and bid <hi>Simaon Feo</hi> (one of ours whom he
had against the Law of Arms detain'd Prisoner) tell
<hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas,</hi> that he wondred to see him so
pent up, without Sallying out to Fight in the Field,
as did the brave Cavallier <hi>Antonio da Sylveira,</hi> that his
actions very much disagreed with his words; our men
answered the message with Bullets from the Wall; the
Battery lasted five hours, not without doing a great deal
of Dammage to the Buildings, which were tottering
before; yet our Shot return'd it with more loss, and
better fortune, for a Bullet at randome kill'd a <hi>Moor</hi> in
the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Tent, as he was discoursing with him; and
the Eastern <hi>Moors</hi> credulously addicted to <hi>Omens,</hi> the

and Envy, brought him and his Prisoner to the Captain.
I will now relate a Circumstance greater then the

Souldier, and missing it when he was in the Fortress,
thinking he had lost it in striving and closing with the

looking it in the sight of an incenst Army, found it, and
brought it back, not less rash then fortunate.</p>
            <p>53. By the News the <hi>Moor</hi> brought, the Captain
knew, that <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> and <hi>Iuzarcaon,</hi> this stout, the
other desperate, had both mutually Vow'd to <hi>Mahomet</hi>
to take <hi>Dio,</hi> or perish in the design; that, if they could
not brook us when vve vvere Friends, they should not
endure us when Conquerours. By their continual
Battering many of their great Guns burst, instead of
which they sitted others, shooting impetuously against
Saint <hi>Iohns,</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s Bastions,
Commanded by <hi>Dom Iohn de Almeyda, Lovis de Sousa,</hi>
and <hi>Gil Coutinho,</hi> who slept always in their Armour, in
danger constant, unwearied in duty.</p>
            <p>54. Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s Bastion was the weakest and most
battered, and the <hi>Turks</hi> in that fought with our men
upon very little disadvantage. There was not in the
Portress Parapet or Battlement which was not thrown
down, and from Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> to Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s Bastion
all the Curtain was open, which made the duty of the
Day be seconded by the labour of the Night, it being
not possible, yet necessary for so few Defendants, so
broken, to repair in a few hours the ruins of a Fortress
so every where Battered, yet did they unanimously
betake themselves to that Labour, they could neither
master or excuse.</p>
            <p>55. The Women of the Fortress help't to bring Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57115:62"/>
for the making up the Breaches,<note place="margin">The courage of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Dio.</hi>
               </note> going without
any fear upon the Wall, stumbling at Lances, Swords,
and Bullets, mastring their Nature and Sex, as if they
wore men's hearts in a disguise: some there were who
put on Arms and brav'd the Enemy, running from their
Needle to a Lance, from their Couch to the VVall;
of all the rest <hi>Isabell Fernandez</hi> deserv'd the greatest
glory, whom (instead of Praises to honour her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory)
our VVriters call the Old woman of <hi>Dio,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
by this name in the Annals and Memorials of the
<hi>East.</hi> This great Matron spent part of her Estate in
Junkets and Regallos,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 2. Cap. 2.</note> with vvhich in the heat of the
dispute she fed the Souldiers, animating 'em (with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
above the courage and judgment of a VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
to defend themselves by Fighting. This diligence
of the Matrons (which readily and seasonably put
'em upon any thing, were it servile, or hazardous) was
in fine a lightning their Labour, and an example in
Dangers.</p>
            <p>56. <hi>Coge-Sofar,</hi> seeing that the mischief his Arms
did by Day our industry repair'd by Night, contriv'd a
design more subtil in the laying of it, then usefull by
the success. Against Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s work, (vvhich by its
make and place lay most obnoxious) he resolv'd to
cast up an other which should equal or command it,
that by Battering it from above he might throw down
the Battlements, so hindring the Defendants from Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and from making up their Breaches by night, his
Guns being so Levell'd by day as to be sure of their
aim. He presently ordered vvhole mountains of Earth,
and brush Fagotts to be brought to fill up the Ditch,
and strengthned the Counterscarp vvith bodies of
great Trees, to keep up the Earth. The multitude of
Pioneers vvho vvere in the Camp made up an other
Army, vvho without fear or time carry'd on the vvork.
In the interim the Guns from our work plaid to the
great loss of the Enemy, for the Work-men being so
thick and expos'd, not one Shot from the Fortress was
lost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:57115:62"/>
57. <hi>Coge-Sofar,</hi> considering the greatness of the loss,
gave order they should work by Night, when our shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
being without aim and at Rovers the Execution
would be less, commanding them to make the most
Noise, where they Work't least, that our Canoneers
led by their Ear, might point their Ordnance as the
Sounds and Ecchos reach't them. This was known to
<hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas,</hi> who fill'd the Fortress with
Lights that the Pioneers who work't on the security
of the Night, might be expos'd to the same danger as
by day; but <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> (who had learn't Experience
in the Warrs of <hi>Europe</hi>) gave order for the making of
crooked and cover'd Trenches, by which the <hi>Moors</hi>
more securely went on with the raising their Fort, and
we vainly to our loss spent store of our Bullets.</p>
            <p>58. The Captain was not a little troubled at it, for
if that work went forward there would not be any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
place in the Fortress, the Enemies Canon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
our Fortifications; so that between the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegers
and Besieg'd there would be no advantage of
place, and that of numbers the <hi>Moors</hi> had eminently
above us. Upon debate of the matter in Counsel every
one knew the danger, none the remedy. Some, with
more Courage the Prudence, were for our mens Sally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth with apparent danger to interrupt their
work, not considering the hazard they run upon, to be
greater then that they freed themselves from; but few
consented to this advice, yet none could give other.
Some Sallies ours made but to little purpose, for the
Numbers and Vigilancy of the Enemy secur'd with a
great Guard the Posts of the Work-men. But in great
Straights danger being usually the best Counsellour,
<hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> bethought himself of an eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the Fortress, which was higher then Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s
Fort, from whence our Guns might play; here he made
some Pieces be planted, which did so lucky Execution,
as in a few days they beat down that Machine, which
in its raising and falling cost the Blood of those who
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57115:63"/>
Built it. But this <hi>Hydra</hi> being of so many Heads, with
the same ruins <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> set upon the filling up the
Ditch, which was easier for him, being a Work that
needed neither measure, design, or fore-cast.</p>
            <p>59. Two thousand Pioneers began with the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of the Fort to fill up the Ditch, and whilst 'twas
doing a great body from the Army with Darts, Arrows,
and Musquet-shot, kept our men from coming to the
Wall. The work increast as did the danger of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
for the Fortress being ruin'd above, the plain
ground with but little raising would be equal to the
Wall. The Captain laid about to frustrate his design,
and being irresolv'd how, some Old men (brought up
in the Fortress) told him that by their quarters there
was a Sally-port in the VVall, which length of time
had covered with loose Earth; that, by that, without
any danger, and with a great deal of ease, might be
stole away the Earth they brought to fill up the Ditch.
The necessity demanded speedy Execution, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
commanded men to Digg, and found a Sally-port
fit for his purpose. Our men Sallied out in the Night,
and stole the Rubbish which was undermost,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 2. Cap. 3.</note> leaving a
hollow superficies which covered the hollowness, solid
in appearance to the Enemies, and as the ground was
expos'd to the violence of the Weather it sunk of it
self, with the fall of all that imaginary Superstructure
in sight of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>60. <hi>Coge-Sofar</hi> had presently intelligence of the way
we took to delude that which cost him so much pains,
and coming to that place (out of impatience to see
all his designs Counterplotted) there came out of the
Fortress a Bullet shot at randome which took off his
Head,<note place="margin">

               </note> in the middle of a Squadron of <hi>Turks.</hi> There
was in the Army a general resentment for the loss of so
great a Souldier. Our men saw them with inarticulate
Lamentations, and drag'd Colours bury the Body, with
all the Military and Civil ceremony the vanity of VVarr
could teach 'em: His Son <hi>Rumecaon</hi> swore presently by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57115:63"/>
the Blood of his Father, to be reveng'd of it, grief and
anger being amongst them the last Sacrifice offer'd to
their Dead.</p>
            <p>61. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> succeeded his Father in his Enmity,
and Charge,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rumecaon</hi> his Son suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds him.</note> carrying on the Warr with the Obligation
of a General, and Resentment of a Son, engag'd both
by his grief and office. He commanded the filling up
the Ditch should in six several places be gone on with,
the Army being hourly furnish't with Pioneers, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Munition, and Souldiers, and the work every
where rising, which <hi>Rumecaon</hi> hastned on, as a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to a general assault; by comparing designs, he too
bethought himself to go on with contrivances that his
Father had begun; He made six cover'd approaches,
all which ended at the Sally-port of our Fortress, by
which ours had tane away the Earth, these met upon a
wooden Bridge, which we had made there, out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
under it to steal the Earth; upon this they were
making the Fabrick we spake of, charging the Bridge
with Stones and Timber, of such a bigness as the weight
sunk it, and it presently fell to the ground with the loss
of those who were at work under it. The Commander
seeing this, ordered the shutting up of the Sally-port,
the use of it being tane away, and to avoid any suddain
invasion of the Enemy, who without any interruption
work't on; while we were Hammering out, any Plot,
or open Force to defeat so dangerous a Fabrick, on
confidence of which, the <hi>Moors</hi> (by their Festivals and
Shouting) seem'd already rather to enjoy then expect
the Victory.</p>
            <p>62. Those cares were seconded by others of no less
weight, for there were not now in the Fortress two
hundred Fighting men, some being wore out by Duty,
others by Sickness, and Wounds, and had more need of
recovering their strength, then exposing it in second
dangers. Amongst the common Souldiers distrust made
way for fear; Provision, and Ammunition were scarce;
the stormy Seas and cruel VVinter cut off all hopes of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57115:64"/>
relief; for, either to send for't or receive it, the Season
was not convenient.</p>
            <p>63. <hi>Iohn Coelho</hi> was Vicar of the Fortress,<note place="margin">The Vicar <hi>Iohn Coelho</hi> goes to the Governour.</note> who had
besides the Virtues of Priesthood resolution enough to
go upon any danger; He offered himself to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
(which was very acceptable to him) in spight
of storms to venture to Sea, and touching at <hi>Bacaim,</hi>
or <hi>Chaul,</hi> as an Eye-witness to acquaint the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
how things stood, thence too, by <hi>Corriers</hi> over
Land to give the Governour intelligence, promising on
his Habit to return with the first news to <hi>Dio</hi> as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Companion of their Fortunes. The Commander
presently provided him a Catch with twelve Mariners,
where wee'l leave him wrastling with the Waves, till
we are to give an account of the success of so stout and
pious a Voyage.</p>
            <p>64. The <hi>Moors</hi> by force work't in filling up the
Ditch, imperious and cruel <hi>Rumecaon</hi> commanding
them to Dye, or continue Working; for their reward,
receiving in the very act, a miserable Grave. They at
last came to lay the Ditch plain, and against <hi>Gil Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinho</hi>'s
works where it could not be fill'd, they laid cross
great Masts, with planks fastned to 'em, which they
made use of for a Bridge, under that to ruine the VVall,
which our Guns could not hinder 'em in, for they were
cover'd.</p>
            <p>65. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> immediately ordered
great Chains, to throw them from the VVall on the
Bridge, there hung at 'em Sacks of shreds dipt in Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,
Salt-peter, and other Combustible matter,
which being thrown, fir'd so violently on the Bridge, as
presently to ruine it. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> came to make good the
work with new Planks, more VVork-men, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
these defended the place, the others continued
Labouring; which our men endeavoured to interrupt
by their Canon and Musquet shot, which did very much
hurt the Enemy; but <hi>Rumecaon</hi> went on so obstinately,
that he made fresh men pass over the Dead, who though
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57115:64"/>
forc't upon't, overcome the danger by their Obedience.
By so chargeable a way of working, he at last came to
fill up the Ditch.</p>
            <p>66. <hi>Rumecaon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Propositions offered to our men by <hi>Rumecaon.</hi>

mind to sound our Inclinations, believing in so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a Conjuncture, Reason and Nature would teach us
not to throw away our Lives. At the beginning of the
Night, those on Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s work heard one calling
to the VVatch in <hi>Portuguese,</hi> saying, he was <hi>Simaon Feo,</hi>
who upon some extraordinary business would speak
with the Commander in chief.<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Cap. 4. Lib. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi>
had presently notice of it, and entring into discourse
with the Souldier, he told him, that he was <hi>Simaon Feo,</hi>
sent by <hi>Rumecaon,</hi> who had a mind, out of his affection
to the Courage of so great Souldiers, to save their
Lives, they now desperately defended; that they saw
the Fortress every where Ruin'd, the greatest part of
the Souldiers sick, or VVounded, without any hope of
relief, in vvant of Provisions and Ammunition; that
vve should not by perishing obstinately, discredit by the
rashness of a few, the greatness of our Actions; that
vve vvould give up our selves, he desiring for his own
glory to keep alive so brave Enemies; that he vvould
give us all Honourable terms, leaving us the disposal of
our Estates, and Ships for our passage, vvhich if vve ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
not, vve vvere to look to endure the rigour of
VVarr, and that Licentiousness vvhich in Onslaughts is
Authoriz'd by Indignation and Victory. <hi>Dom Iohn
Mascarenhas</hi> answered him, that the Fortress the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guese</hi>
kept needed no VValls; that in the open Field
they vvould defend it against the strength of the vvhole
VVorld; that on the first assault he should learn this
truth, that he ought to bethink himself of sending to
the <hi>Sultan</hi> for more men, and better Souldiers; that the
<hi>Portuguese</hi> scorn'd such small Victories; that he hop't
with Heads of <hi>Turks</hi> to make up the ruins of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress;
that if he vvanted Provisions, he vvould go look
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57115:65"/>
for 'em as Booty in his Camp; that as long as his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were Arm'd, they could want nothing in the
possession of their Enemies; that he hop'd shortly
through his arm'd Squadrons with Sword in hand to cut
out the happy passage he offered him, he told <hi>Simaon
Feo,</hi> that, though he was oblig'd to repeat an others
words, he should not return with an other message, for
he would make him be Shot from the Wall.</p>

resolv'd to give the first assault; There broke upon us
a Dismall day, (which was the nineteenth of <hi>Iuly</hi> in
the year 1546.) the Enemies Army at the Dawning,
being seen round the Fortress. <hi>Iuzarcaon</hi> with fifteen
hundred choise men fell upon Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>s work, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Luis de Sousa,</hi> with whom were <hi>Dom Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando
de Castro, Sebastion de Sa, Diogo de Reynoso, Pero
Lopez de Sousa, Diogo da Sylva, Antonio da Cunba,</hi> and
other Gentlemen and Souldiers not passing thirty;
These with so much Bravery expected the first shock of
the Enemy, that they beat back the first fourscore who
began to Scale, who by their Out-crys, Blood, and Fall,
shew'd the loss they had receiv'd; Others presently
came after them, finding the dead Bodies had made their
Scaling easier; <hi>Iuzarcaon</hi> encouraged them, by mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
'em of their honour, their reward, and their venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
The striking on the Air by the Guns, and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of men, made an hideous impression on the Walls
of the Fortress. The Battery was continued against the
other works, the assault against Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>'s, and Saint
<hi>Thomas</hi>'s; that those who in themselves were but few,
might being divided, sooner yield.</p>
            <p>68. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> with his <hi>Turks</hi> assaulted Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s
work,<note place="margin">And Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s.</note> kept by <hi>Dom Iohn de Almeyda,</hi> and <hi>Gil Coutinho;</hi>
his men pick't out for their Valour, and of a proud Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
fell on so furiously, as though run through with
our Lances, they gave not over Scaling, seeking for
Victory in their Death; they had the advantage of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57115:65"/>
numbers, we of place, and those who had bestrid the
Wall, must either Enter Victoriously or Dye wounded,
Retiring being more dangerous, then Fighting. The
Enemy with fresh men continually re-inforced the
Assault; Ours, always the same, were too hard for the
first Assailants, and match for the last. The Women
came to their help with Arms, and Powder, putting on
that Courage which was rather seasonable then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
some of 'em with Regallos and Drinks put Life
into the Souldiers, and not able to show their own
strength, did encrease it in others; there were of them,
who animated 'em with Speeches, deserving to have
had in so great hearts the force of men; and amongst
the actions of this Siege we shall relate theirs as most
unusual, if not as the greatest. There was seen at the
foot of the work a Mountain of Dead bodies, some
with their Wounds bleeding, others burnt with the
Fire; some at their last Gasp, 'twixt anger and grief,
cry'd for Vengeance; sometimes too it hapned, that
those who went to Vindicate 'em Dy'd first. Our men
that day did wonders, which were more easily seen by
their success, then they can be by Writing; for in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularizing
accidents the truth is uncertain, most of all
in the chances of Warr, where anger, fear, and other
passions so captivate the judgment, that each particular
man can hardly be a faithfull Historian of his own
Actions.</p>
            <p>69. <hi>Dom Fernando de Castro</hi> that day gave proof of a
Courage befitting his Birth,<note place="margin">What resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance our men made.</note> and above his Years. <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
de Sa</hi> left us a famous memory of his Valour, till
having his Knee shot through with a poyson'd Arrow,
and falling down for Dead,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Cap. 4. Lib. 2.</note> not being able to maintain
the Fight, he would not forsake it; He was at last by
his Camrades, full of grief and envy, carry'd off, having
before sufficiently reveng'd his Blood on the Enemy.
Every one in fine behav'd himself so Stoutly, as that
one day was enough to make 'em Souldiers. After
Fighting two hours they seem'd but to begin the assault,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57115:66"/>
               <hi>Rumecaon</hi> carrying himself as if in one day he intended
to make an end of the VVarr. He commanded every
Nation to Fight by themselves, either the more to Spurr
'em on by Emulation, or that they might better observe
Orders; he himself, Commanding and Fighting, by his
Voice, and Example made 'em stand to't, and not glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Blood he saw spilt, Prais'd the forwardest,
and Vilify'd the backward'st, carrying out 'midst the
horrour of Arms, his anger with prudence. <hi>Dom Iohn
Maescarenhas</hi> behav'd himself not only as a Commander,
but a Companion where the greatest danger was, Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Commanding so prudently, that he came off
owing nothing to Courage, less to Conduct.</p>
            <p>70. <hi>Rumecaon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Enemy re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>res with loss.</note> seeing the great numbers of Dead
which were about the VVorks, and that his men kept
back when commanded to come on, commanded the
sounding of a Retreat, carrying off in great haste the
Dead and VVounded, so to keep from his own their
Loss, and from us our Victory; yet we had it from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they lost in this assault five hundred men,
the VVounded were many more; there Dy'd of ours
but one Souldier, the VVounded were less then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
By this disproportion 'tis seen that the Victory was
not only obtain'd by Human force, but that God main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the cause as his own; our Arms being the happy
Instruments of his Power, of which the History will
yet give us greater proofs.</p>
            <p>71. Upon the Enemies retiring the Commander in
Chief summon'd our men to a second Labour, which
the Necessity, or Victory made them easily digest. The
Breaches of the Fortress were of force to be made up;
the Stones and Mortar, being the soft Beds which our
Souldiers had to recover their so decaid strength with;
they all went willingly and chearfully on the Service,
led on by the example of the Commander, who after
the Enemies, Conquer'd his own Nature. The Fortress
in the morning appear'd in part repair'd, our men by
their working recovering themselves, as if they had been
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57115:66"/>
at rest; the weight of their Arms not permitting them
to make any difference 'twixt Day and Night. The
Enemy was by this assault so broken, as he durst not in
many days come to Blows with us, his experience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him more Cautious or Cowardly; He now and
then fac't the Fortress vvith some inconsiderable Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queering,
to shake us with continual Alarums, or by our
taking our Posts, to observe the inclinations of our
minds; yet did he not leave off Battering, intending by
a long Siege to vveaken us: but the Camp daily encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vvith new Recruits, and the <hi>Sultan</hi> declaring his
concernment for this Warr, <hi>Rumecaon</hi> resolv'd to give
the Fortress the second assault.</p>
            <p>72. And considering the loss he had receiv'd, though
Fighting vvith so much advantage of numbers, he
look't upon the slaughter of his men as having higher
Causes, for vvhich 'twas fit to appease the Prophet.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iuzarcaon</hi> falls to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</note> He
immediately commanded the bringing forth of a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
vvhich had in it the Picture of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and that

<hi>Mahomed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 2. Cap. 5.</note> whose displeasure retarded their Victory.
<hi>Fernaon Carvalho,</hi> Commander of the vvork toward
the Sea, saw the Army that night go in Procession vvith
great store of Lights, and by times heard Noise and
Clamours which presently ended in a suddain silence,
again bursting forth into Groans of a confus'd multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
their Sighs and Out-crys were seconded by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of VVarr, and in this Superstitious vanity

for an assault, abetted by some Barbarous ceremony and
Superstitious rite, with vvhich they hop't to reconcile

            <p>73. The Commander in Chief made ready for this

second storm of the Enemy, finding in such shattered
Forces, all his Souldiers heart-whole, the Wounded
and Sick quitted their Beds and Cures, more eager to
go upon Dangers then recover their Health. <hi>Dom Iohn
Mascarenhas</hi> with Courage and Judgment ordered and
dispos'd what was necessary for their defence;<note place="margin">An other assault.</note> Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
was hardly broke when the Enemy appear'd before
the Fortress with Clamours and dolefull Noises, which
by the sounding of Warlike instruments were in the
silence of the Night made more Dreadfull; The Army
came up divided into three Squadrons, and had carry'd
before 'em (amongst the rest) a Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ner in which was
the Image of their Prophet, that both Religion and
their King's honour might animate them; at the same
time they fell upon Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> and Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s work,
and <hi>Antonio Pecanha</hi>'s Guard with so much sury as they
neither saw or fear'd danger, but were by ours so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
as they were with more haste forc't back, then
they came in to the Onset, many falling down Dead,
most of 'em Wounded, and others burnt by Fire. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarcaon</hi>
and <hi>Rumecaon</hi> were heard to incite others to
Scale the Works, who under shelter of the Vollees of
Musquets, infinite Arrows, and other Shouting, did go on
afresh. 'Twas here the assault was Kindled in a great
deal of heat, the <hi>Turks</hi> earnest to recover their lost
Credit, were by rage and shame put upon Fighting, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
getting up through Fire and Sword, like men
who less valued their Lives then the Victory, so as they
got to be on the same ground with ours, Fighting man
to man upon the Work.</p>
            <p>74. <hi>Louis de Sousa, Dom Fernando de Castro,</hi> with
the other Gentlemen and Souldiers of their Company
did that day give new repute to our Arms, so behaving
themselves as <hi>Rumecaon</hi> represented 'em to his men,
sometimes for their example, others as their shame; the
<hi>Turks</hi> were continually reliev'd, Ours, always the same,
shew'd themselves as stout against the last as first; the
Fight grew hot every where, of the Enemies a great
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57115:67"/>
many were Kill'd and VVounded, yet did their rage or
anger, either hide or slight the loss; for, on the Body
of him who fell did an other plant himself, to fling his
Lance, or Fight more firmly, the heat and impatience
of Victory inventing new Subtilties or never heard of
Cruelties.</p>
            <p>75. They at last entred Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s work,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> enter Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s work.</note> which
for a good while they kept, as some fell others coming
in their place. 'Twas here the fury of the Enemy was
great, as well as their Slaughter. <hi>Dom Francisco,</hi> and
<hi>Dom Pedro de Almeydo</hi> shew'd themselves Brothers as well
by their Soutness as Blood, withstanding the shock of so
many Enemies all the time of the assault.</p>
            <p>76. The <hi>Turks</hi> of <hi>Rumecaon</hi>'s Division fought with
ours Body to Body, upon equality of ground, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of numbers, the danger heightning our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
Few of those who entred the work got off Alive,
but having this Door open towards Victory they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
though with eminent danger to keep it so.
This being the first honour the chance of Arms had in
the Warr conferr'd on <hi>Rumecan,</hi> he with praises and
promises rais'd the pride of the <hi>Turks.</hi> 'Twas nois'd
amongst ours the work was lost, which Alarum,
whether 'twas craft, or chance, might have lost the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress;
for those who fought in other places almost all
forsook their Posts to relieve the work they gave for
gone; those chiefly who Guarded the Houses toward
the Rock, came so furiously to the Relief, as the rest had
time to Breathe, who by their Duty and VVounds were
now wearied and broken.</p>
            <p>77. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> went about the Posts,
assuring them all, that the work was yet ours, and how
Couragiously 'twas maintain'd; that <hi>Rumecaon</hi> stood
looking on the Slaughter of his men, who cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
weltring in their Blood from the VVall, and by
their fall made sure of their Deaths. The Storming
continu'd, and on both sides Death and Wounds seem'd
to add to their Courage and Bravery, which <hi>Iuzarcaon</hi>

in Chief, crying, <hi>Turks</hi> in the Fortress; they found him
with three Souldiers running about the Works; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

one of the Souldiers with commands to draw

sent off an other Souldier to bring him all the scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

kept 'em fast, and, with more then masculine Courage
disputed their coming forth; so unfortunate as to have
no reward in her Life, so no name in our History.</p>
            <p>80. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> looking on the so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Valour found in a VVoman, as an Omen of
the Victory, having it from her, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were
Lockt up in the House, sent a <hi>Abessine</hi> (who by chance
was there) for a Pan of Powder, and because he
mov'd slowly, shov'd him by the Arm, when at the same
instant from the Leads of the Church, (where were
gotten some <hi>Turks</hi>) came a Bullet, which Kill'd the
<hi>Abessine,</hi> who kept it off from the Captain. There pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
came a Souldier with Powder, which <hi>Dom Iohn

Doors, threw in amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Fire burnt most
of 'em, and the Bullets which with certain aim they
Shot from within mist him, which was interpreted to
be by chance, by some others, providence. Behaving
himself that day like Commander and Souldier, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with his Buckler, and having his Sword in his hand,
with four more he set upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> and by dint of
Sword drove 'em to the Gallery,<note place="margin">And drives out the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> where he so prest 'em,

<hi>Turks</hi> with two Banners planted, beginning to Shoot
our men from above as they came on; here 'twas the

Fortune out-went Courage. VVe were less then
sixty, the <hi>Turks</hi> more then an hundred. <hi>Dom Iohn Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carenhas</hi>
seeing, that by keeping the place they encreas'd,
sent for Scaling-Ladders, chance and necessity so orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it, that in his own Fortress he was forc'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

the VVall, the Commander in chief striving first to get
up, vvas by the Souldiers just violence kept from passing.
Our men got up by the VValls of the Apostle Saint
<hi>Iames</hi>'s Church, confident by the place, of the Victory;
the advantage of place made great Odds in their Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Enemy had firm footing, Ours by their hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Air broke two Ladders, for their strife and
heat vvho should first get up vvas an other VVarr. The
Commander by his vvords and example animated the
Souldiers, vvhich he did more out of his Duty then
Necessity. The Conflict vvas obstinate and resolute,
some of our men fell back Dead, none came off VVoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
The impatience of getting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Cruelty.</p>
            <p>82. <hi>Iuzarcaon</hi> encourag'd and reliev'd his, vvith
fresh men so, as in a little time he fill'd the place where
they fought, (which was the Leads or Roof of the
Church) with Souldiers. Ours at last, after a sharp
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57115:69"/>
contest, at the price of their Blood got upon the Wall,
showing in the inequality of place and numbers, a
difference in Courage. Three long hours the dispute
lasted,<note place="margin">And retire.</note> in which time the few who were there so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
themselves, as that one Action deserv'd a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

who by their Blood challeng'd so distinct a memory.
The <hi>Turks</hi> were almost all Kill'd, some by their fall,
others in the Fight, and suppos'd to be their best men,
who were singled out for so great an Action.</p>
            <p>83. The Commander hearing the assault lasted yet
on the Works, carry'd off his men to refresh 'em in a
second danger, and visiting the Posts, found our men so
engag'd in keeping off the Enemy, that after four hours
the assault seem'd but to begin; The Dead at the foot
of the Works were so many as they wanted ground to
lye upon, whose Bodies made the Scaling of the Wall
easier. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> without, encourag'd, or reproach'd
his men, as he saw the bravery or coldness of their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in Fighting; provoking 'em by Rewards, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments;
on all occasions of this Siege showing both
Resolution and Discipline. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi>
gave not over Ordering, and Providing what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
every where, so as the Souldiers in no danger
found him wanting; On that day which was the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s, it appear'd the Saint would shew
us the Victory was his, and that he was not now less
Powerfull against the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> then he had been
before in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>84. The dispute continued hot and dreadfull on
both sides, <hi>Iuzarcaon</hi> (taking it to heart, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
the Scaling of the Fortress which had cost him so
dear) came with those men under his Command, to
put more Life into the assault, when by a Bullet from
the Fortress, which hit him on the Breast, and past
through him he fell down Dead;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iuzarcaon</hi>'s Death.</note> And being a Person
of such Value, for his Courage, and the place he held,
the News was immediately disperct through the Army,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57115:70"/>
when it came to <hi>Rumecaon</hi>'s Ears (was it Fear, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion)
he receiv'd it vvith no little Resentment,
immediately Commanding the sounding a Retreat,
to bring off <hi>Iuzarcaon</hi>'s body, a loss could not be
conceal'd from his men, and being greater then any they
had before sustain'd, they now thought the Victory not
worth what it had already cost, and if they should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve
it, doubted who would remain to enjoy it. That
their Prophet apparently shew'd himself angry with
them, since he could endure to see his Banner so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniously
torn. To these Considerations they added
others which spoke against their Generals fortune, and
the cause of the Warr; laying to his charge that they
had the worst of it. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> by diverse Artifices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy'd
these jealousies, Palliating his own loss, and
Enhauncing ours, laying before 'em the <hi>Sul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of all men, as we shall prove by the visible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of example.</p>
            <p>90. The Ladies and Maids of <hi>Chaul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Women of <hi>Chaul</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their Jewels.</note> possest by the
same generous Spirit, contributed all the Jewels and
Gold they wore, and with a Liberality above VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
without either obligation, or asking, sent 'em
to the Governour, and with 'em word that they had
less tenderness then envy for their Children and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands

            <p>91. When the present came, there was accidentally
in <hi>Goa</hi> a Lady of <hi>Chaul</hi> (by name <hi>Catherina de Sousa</hi>) who
putting all the Jewels she had in a little Box, with this
Letter sent 'em to the Governour. <q>Sir, Knowing the
Women of <hi>Chaul</hi> have presented your Honour with
all their Jewels for the carrying on this Warr,<note place="margin">The present and Letter of a Lady.</note> though
I am now in <hi>Goa,</hi> I would not be without my share of
that honour, which belongs to me, as one of that
place. I send your Honour my Jewels by my Daughter
<hi>Katherine.</hi> Guess not by the smallness of their number,
how many may be in <hi>Chaul,</hi> for I assure you I am she
who have the fewest, having divided 'em amongst my
Daughters; and your Honour may believe, that the
Jewels of <hi>Chaul</hi> alone, without being Exhausted, are
sufficient for ten years to continue the Warr. The
favour I begg of your Honour is, presently to spend
mine in <hi>Don Alvaro</hi>'s expedition, because I hope by
the intercession of our Lady he will get such signal
Victories as will excuse your Honour's Voyage and
Trouble: this I begg in my Prayers, and that our
Lady by Hers will so add to your Honour's Life, as
you may return into <hi>Portugall</hi> to the presence of
your Lady-wife and Daughters. Dated in <hi>Goa,</hi> at

               </gap>fection to the Governour produc't these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.
We have seen as much necessity for it, but not so
great Bravery as in <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi>'s time. Many
Gentlemen, after having been Generals, and now Old
men leaning upon Staffs, came and offer'd themselves
for Souldiers, there not being any one grown stiff by his
Years or Command.</p>
            <p>92. After both Reliefs were gone,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Cap. 7. Lib. 2.</note> the Governour
was uniting the strengths which remain'd, and disposing
the Government of the City in his absence. All the
Exigencies of the State found him ready with one hand
in Peace, the other in Warr. And the Fortress wanting
Ammunition, and Provision, (besides what was already
sent) he Laded a great Carvell, which being a heavy
Vessel would have much ado to endure the Sea. Some
Souldiers had refus'd to go upon her, counting it dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
without reputation to strive with the Elements.
The importance of the business made him desire to
entrust the Carvell with some Person of Quality, whose
honour would lessen the danger. He imparted the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to <hi>Manoel de Sousa de Sepulveda,</hi> a Gentleman, for
his Courage and Judgment, very much indear'd to him;
who told him, <hi>Antonio Moniz Baretto</hi> had Gallantry and
Industry enough for greater things; that though, for
some sleight Quarrel against him as Governour, he
would not sue for, yet would he not deny the King's
Service in so great an urgency; that he would feel him,
and bring the answer of his Resolution. So it was, that
<hi>Antonio Moniz,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of a Voyage to <hi>Dio.</hi>
               </note> understanding the Governours pleasure,
and that he put him on a Voyage whose difficulty only
made others refuse it, presently embrac't it. We will
in its proper place tell the success and danger he met
with.</p>
            <p>93. There was by the Vigilancy of the Governour
entred some Relief into the Fortress, by which the
Danger and Duty lay upon more Shoulders, yet were
they not in any proportion to the Enemy, because the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57115:72"/>
last Recruit which came to the Army, consisted of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
thousand Foot,<note place="margin">There come an other <hi>Iuzarcaon</hi> to continue the Siege.</note> under the Conduct of an other
<hi>Iuzarcaon,</hi> in Valour not Inferiour, nor in Fortune <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ove
the first. He brought express Orders from the <hi>Sultan</hi>
to streighten the Siege, and Letters from him to <hi>Rume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caon,</hi>
that he could not stand by and see four contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
Fellows, from the Worlds end, affront the Kings
of <hi>Cambaya</hi> at home; that they should all Dye in the
design; that he had rather have a desolate then a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
Empire; that half the <hi>Portuguese</hi> being already
Buried in the ruins of the Fortress, if they could not
force 'em to yield as Men, they should as Lyons kill 'em
in their Dens. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> gave no other answer, then by
shewing (sometimes for his glory, sometimes for his
excuse) our Walls, and Works, every where thrown
down, being very much transported that the <hi>Sultan</hi>
was not satisfy'd with what he had done, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok't
with despair, then reward, he promis'd to satisfie
him by Death, or Victory; and being more obey'd for
his Cruelty then Command,<note place="margin">The Enemy makes a Bastion.</note> he ordered the making of
a Bastion before Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s work, which was with
incredible haste perform'd, and furnish't with Men and
Ordnance; and commanding our Works, our men
could not appear without being fech't off by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Bullets.</p>
            <p>94. The Commander in Chief was not a little
troubled at it;<note place="margin">Ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

was) Storm on that side, our Defendants would not
be able to resist him, without lying open to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
shot. Resolv'd therefore to throw down the Work,
he recommends the Execution of it to two Brothers,
<hi>Dom Pedro,</hi> and <hi>Dom Iohn de Almeyda,</hi> who Sallying out
about Mid-night with an hundred Souldiers, found the
<hi>Moors,</hi> some sleeping, others careless on confidence of
the place and hour. Charging them on a suddain, in a
little time they made a great Slaughter, for, forgetting
themselves they run upon our Lances and Swords, not
aware of Death or Enemy. Those who by flying could
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57115:73"/>
provide for themselves, with Groans and Crys gave the
Allarum to the Camp, without being able to affirm any
thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> for certain. In the same confusion came the news
to <hi>Rumecaon,</hi> who (as dangers by Night appear bigger)
concluded this Exploit of ours was grounded on some
great Recruit arriv'd by stealth, which escap'd his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels.
He call'd the Officers to Counsel whilst the
Army betook themselves to their Arms, and resolv'd
with all his strength to relieve the Bastion. He wasted
the time of Action in Orders and Preparations, and
coming to the place found the Work on the ground, the
Guards kill'd, and our men Retir'd; an Action of no less
fortune then concernment. There Dy'd of the Enemy
three hundred, of our not one.</p>
            <p>95. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> presently ordered the raising thick
Walls of Earth against Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>'s work, to be Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by a Troop of <hi>Moors,</hi> who by turns took the Watch,
and on the top of 'em he planted some Canon to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the VVork at a more convenient distance. <hi>Dom
Iohn Mascarenhas,</hi> Vigilant in preventing the designs of
the Enemy,<note place="margin">The Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> put out through a Skit-gate fourteen Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
in a stormy and dark Night, who charging on a
suddain the <hi>Moors,</hi> drove them from their Posts, whilst
the Labourers with Pick-axes and other Instruments
threw down the Work, which being told <hi>Rumecaon,</hi> he
resolv'd with open force to storm the Fortress, ordering
for the next day a general Assault, on which he made a
Speech to his Souldiers, encouraging 'em, by the affronts
they had receiv'd from so few Enemies, brought Low
by Duty, Hunger, and VVounds, that those who fell
there were more honourable then those who surviv'd,
to be to the VVorld an infamous testimony of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
VVarr; that it was in them, to save their King's
Honour, to revenge their Companions and to leave a
glorious Fame of themselves in the <hi>East;</hi> that they
ought to be confident of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s thanks, for he
would not fail to reward 'em, and take a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all their VVounds; that if any would venture
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57115:73"/>
to govern the Generals staff, he promis'd as a private
Souldier to be the first should Scale the Wall.</p>
            <p>96. Thus he left 'em fir'd with glory and revenge.
Next morning by break of Day, at the Noise of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Instruments, and with their Colours flying (the
Displaying of which was observ'd by ours) the Army
march't,<note place="margin">A general assault.</note> and coming to the Walls began to plant Scaling
Ladders round about the Fortress, with the advantage
of innumerable and different Shots, of Arrows, Bullets,
and other Arms, which came from the Body of the
Army. The horrour too of the Fight was increas'd by
confus'd and repeated Noises, which, Violently,
raising their Spirits and confounding their Judgments,
hindred both Command and Obedience. The <hi>Moors</hi>
boldly Scal'd the Walls, as did the <hi>Turks</hi> on the other
side, as if they envy'd each others danger, all strove to
be the first at hazards, and blows. Ours, though but
few (every one his own Commander, and encourager)
so behav'd themselves as if each single man had been
to answer for the reputation of all. The first who came
to the top with their Blood and Lives paid for their
daring, but were immediately with the same eagerness
seconded by others, some prick't forward by their own
Courage, others by the General, who from below as
he discovered in 'em, heat, or fear, prais'd or reproach'd
those who Scal'd.</p>
            <p>97. The <hi>Moors</hi> cast Granados, Pots of Powder, and
Balls of Wild-fire in such quantity into the Works, that
our men Fought in the Flames, which catching their
Cloaths burnt them alive. The Commander in chief
strove to avoid this danger with some Barils of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">How our men kept off the Fire.</note>
which did partly extinguish or mitigate the heat of
the Fire; but the Enemy, knowing how much hurt it
did, us'd in all their assaults the same artifice, against
which ours found out a more easie then effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
many Cloathing themselves with Leather, which
the Fire did not so soon seize upon, <hi>Dom Iohn Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carenhas</hi>
with Hangings he had of gilt Leather (the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57115:74"/>
Walls being naked) help't to Clothe many of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>98. The Warr grew hot, and the Fortress (hid in
Clouds of smoak) was hardly seen, 'twas only disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
by a weak Light, the continual Flashing of
Shooting, what was seen, and what was heard was full
of horrour; there were at the Foot of the VVall innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Bodies, some Dead, others Gasping, and all
that was before the sight, or judgment, was a foul
Spectacle, of Deaths, horrour, and wounds. 'Twas in
all the VVorks on both sides Fought with great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
though with disproportion of Numbers 'twixt
the Besiegers and Besieg'd. The work <hi>Luis de Sousa</hi>
defended, (where was <hi>Dom Fernando de Castro</hi>) was
near lost, the assault taking it with the most Breaches,
and being attaqued by the Choise men of the Army:
Yet did the Defendants give glorious marks of their
Valour, Fighting with such Courage in the Flames, as
they shew'd themselves, besides Valiant, insensible. <hi>Dom
Fernando de Castro</hi> did here render himself singular by
Actions above his Years, proving Courage stays not for
Age. The <hi>Portuguese</hi> did that day things worthy a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pen, and larger History. The very <hi>Turks</hi> were testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their Prowess, saying, the <hi>Franks</hi> only deserv'd
to wear Beards.</p>
            <p>99. During the assault the Work toward the Sea
shot often amongst the Enemy, who Fighting in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
were more exposed, and receiv'd no little loss,
which <hi>Rumecaon</hi> taking notice off,<note place="margin">The Enemy retires,</note> seeing his Colours
torn, and his best men Dead, and that without the loss
of a stone the <hi>Portuguese</hi> had maintain'd the Breaches
of their Fortress, commanded the sounding a Retreat,
less sensible of the loss, then shame. That day was at
several time happy to our Arms;<note place="margin">With the Death of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> for the Enemy losing
on the place three hundred, and carrying off two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
VVounded, there was missing none of ours, though
some lost much Blood. The Commander in chief im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
look't after the VVounded; the tenderness
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57115:74"/>
with which he us'd them being the chief remedy; By
helping the infirm, not only with Expence, but grief
and Fellow-feeling; he shew'd himself in Peace their
Father, in VVarr their Companion. Their danger was
presently succeeded by their Labours, for by Night
they all repair'd what the Batteries had thrown down
by Day, and all with such Chearfulness undertook the
Task, as if they came to rest themselves by carrying
Stones, Earth, and Fagots.</p>
            <p>100. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> seeing the hazard and difficulty of
taking the Fortress by Scaling,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Cap. 2. Lib. 8.</note> commanded the filling
up of the Ditch from Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> to Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s
work, a thing he put the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> upon, who proud
of their Repute and Courage did ambitiously covet the
most eminent dangers of the Siege.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rum on</hi> goes about filling up the Ditch.</note> There were Dead
already four hundred, leaving their name and grief for
'em great amongst the surviving, who carry'd on the
VVork, which prov'd to 'em of little advantage and
great danger; for our Guns took 'em off, and a great
many of the VVork-men; whose Bodies by a Cruel and
Barbarous discipline were thrown in to fill up the
Ditch, the VVork being of Fagots and Earth, went on,
Kneaded with the Blood of the poor men who La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
in it. They planted some Pieces with which they
did harm to our works, chiefly Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s, where
they took from us the use of a great Gun, and the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
look't dispos'd for greater Execution.</p>
            <p>101. About that time the Vicar <hi>Iohn Coelho,</hi> with
nine Souldiers in a little Boat arriv'd at the Fortress,<note place="margin">The Vicar returns to <hi>Dio.</hi>
               </note>
for though he found the Seas high, and the VVinds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
pains and necessity over-came the danger; He
reported the Governour was with all diligence prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to come to raise the Siege; that he had already sent
great Recruits; that there were five hundred men in
<hi>Bacaim,</hi> who hop't with the first opportunity to cross
the Gulf; that many not brooking any delay had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ventred to Sea. This news went about the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress,
and was by the Souldiers entertain'd with Dancing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57115:75"/>
and Musick; every one looking out to Sea took the
Clouds for Ships, so credulous are men upon any
glimpse of hopes. The <hi>Moors</hi> had the news of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits,
and before our men should grow in Numbers
with the force they expected, a general assault was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and they resolv'd to enter the Fortress, or by their
Deaths, Blood, and Perishing, show the World and the
<hi>Sultan,</hi> the fault was not theirs.</p>
            <p>102. That day with three and twenty Canon,<note place="margin">A fresh assault.</note> and
some Basilisks they began to Batter, which they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
till Sun setting, and the next day till three in the
afternoon. They threw down most of the Walls, so that
Ours could not by any Reparations or Traveses shelter
themselves from the continual discharging of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Musqueteers. The <hi>Turks</hi> by the ruins of the
Battery got presently on Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s VVork, yet did
the Captain <hi>Luis de Sousa, Dom Fernando de Castro,</hi> and
<hi>Dom Francisco de Almeyda,</hi> with other stout Souldiers
who kept it, receive them with such fury on their
Lances, as they forc't them back, some Dead, others
Maim'd. There presently follow'd fresh men, whom our
Swords made company for the former. The like fortune
had the Fight in the other VVorks, the <hi>Moors</hi> loss, and
our mens courage being the same. The Battery had so
raz'd our Fortress, that the <hi>Moors</hi> (as in a pitch't Field)
fought with Ours upon the same advantage of ground,
Levell'd by the ruins, but by their Numbers and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
did out-do us. Ours that day deserv'd immortal
memory for many hours enduring the weight of so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
a Fight; for those of the Enemies, who were
wearied or wounded, were relieved continually by fresh
men; the <hi>Portuguese</hi> being always the same shew'd no
difference of either Courage or Time.</p>
            <p>103. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> went about all the
Posts commanding,<note place="margin">How our men keep off the Enemy.</note> and Fighting, one while their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
another their Companion, and seeing St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s
work in the greatest danger, being most charg'd by the
Enemy, sent for a great many Pots of Powder, by those
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57115:75"/>
so honourable Matrons, who despising danger and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
came seasonably through Lances and Bullets, to
their help, with unheard of example, and with encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
to the Souldiers full of great judgment and
courage, whilst others animated them with Regallos and
sweet-meats as if they coveted or deserv'd equal fame
with them. We had the wind in our faces, which, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
clouds of Dust from the loose ground the Enemy
stood upon, almost blinded our men, who only by that
accident run the hazard of being lost, yet Fighting with
their Eyes shut they received the <hi>Moors,</hi> more intent
upon offending the Enemy, then providing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The Enemies fought desperately, <hi>Rumecaon</hi> every
moment minding them of their Kings and their own
honour.</p>
            <p>104. <hi>Iuzarcaon</hi> with the Souldiers he commanded,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iuzarcaon</hi> falls upon Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>'s work.</note>
with so great a resolution fell upon St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s work that
our men were in no little danger: for after throwing
down the first who came up, others with so much fury
got upon the Walls, that for many hours they maintain'd
the Fight equal, till wounded with our Swords, some
Dead, others faltring in their Courage, lost the place
and their Lives. Here was the resistance and danger
greatest, for upon our men, whose force was already
wearied and shaken, came other fresh <hi>Moors,</hi> yet, as if
they had kept their strength and courage for the greatest
pinch, they repuls't the last as the first.</p>
            <p>105. In <hi>Antonio Pecanha</hi>'s Post the Fight was not less
stout or fortunate,<note place="margin">The great loss of the Enemy.</note> and without particularizing acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
we may by the success judge the fortune of the
Day: for the Enemy left sixteen hundred Dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the innumerable number of the VVounded: an
incredible thing of a few more then two hundred Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
as were ours: so we find it writ in the Relations
and Histories of that Siege, which being ours do with
a more wary Pen write their own praises. VVe came
off with the loss of three Souldiers, and thirty Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:57115:76"/>
106. The Fortress by the Battery which preceded
this assault was every where Ruin'd and Open, and we
to repair it wanted Time, Materials, and Men; yet did
Ours steal the hours of their rest, working by Night,
and throwing down the Houses of the Fortress, made
use of their Stones and Timber, making a kind of sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
and stoln Defence, more becoming the time then
the necessity.</p>
            <p>107. Ammunition and Provision was wanting,<note place="margin">The strengths of the Fortress.</note> there
was no more Powder then what was every day made,
a little, and ill Dry'd, a want which the <hi>Moors</hi> began
to know, and had thereby the hearts to continue
the Siege, they had likewise advice that the scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of other necessaries was answerable, for Wheat
was at three Crusades an <hi>Alquiere,</hi>
               <note place="margin">About one third of a Bushel.</note> and yet the want of
it greater then the price; the Sick instead of Hens eat
Crows, which coming to feed on the Dead bodies, the
Souldiers kill'd, and at an exorbitant rate Sold, the
Famine came at last to that height, as they spar'd not
Doggs, Cats, and other such Food, unwholsome and
unclean. Yet did they with such miserable Dyet reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their strength, undervaluing dangers, and duty, by
the greatness of their minds over-coming the passions
and affections of Nature.</p>
            <p>108. Pans for Powder (which the Militia of <hi>India</hi>
use by Sea and Land,<note place="margin">How the want of Pots of Powder was supply'd.</note> and in this Siege were of no little
Execution) were as well as other offensive VVeapons
wanting, which was supply'd by putting together two
Gutter-tiles, the Concave inward, and Pitch't with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
at which hung lighted match, and being thrown
amongst the Enemy, divers were burnt by 'em: by this
easie invention did ours hasten the Victory.</p>
            <p>109. The Commander in chief desir'd to get some
intelligence concerning the practices of the Enemy, who
slye, and designing, did yet with strange reserv'dness
keep from us his designs. Besides it was advis'd from the
Fort next the Sea, that most Nights some <hi>Moors</hi> came
as farr as the Bridge of the Fortress, where they stop't,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57115:76"/>
as men who for some end came to survey, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the situation; their silence, the time of
Night, and the continuance of it, evinc't their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
not to be casual. Upon which, <hi>Dom Iohn Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carenhas</hi>
perswaded <hi>Martim Botelho</hi> (a Souldiers of trust)
with ten Camerades to go one Night upon the Bridge,
and endeavour by Force or Craft to bring off one of
those <hi>Moors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Martim Botelho,</hi> with the others about
Mid-night went out at the Skit-gates of the Courtain,
carrying only Swords and Bucklers, and being arriv'd at
the set place, (not to be discovered by the <hi>Moors</hi>) they
lay vvith their Faces on the ground, and listning a while,
heard some coming toward the Bridge, rising, they sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
set upon the <hi>Moors,</hi> vvho vvere eighteen, and
seeing themselves so unawares attaqu'd, did at the first
Onset turn their backs,<note place="margin">Nob <hi>a Town in</hi> Palestine.</note> leaving only on the place a

despair'd of the design, hearing vve should as soon as the

as our men could not make out the design, because

            <p>111. Whilst they vvere vvorking in the Mine, <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecaon</hi>
commanded 'em to seem to sap divers places
of the Wall, that vve being intent upon the common
danger, might not guess at the secret one. And by an
other Plot to divert our attention, he ordered the
making some wooden Horses to be plac't before Saint
<hi>Thomas</hi>'s work, as if by them he intended to take it by
Scaling, and resolving to fall on the tenth of <hi>August,</hi>
on the Ninth he commanded the drawing off some
Guns vvhich he had Planted. And that vve might not

an other design to make us more secure.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rumecaon</hi> endeavours to keep it from us.</note> He that night
sent an <hi>Absessine</hi> subtilly instructed to the Fortress, who
coming to the Wall, counterfeiting a Panick fear, cry'd
to the VVatch to take him in, that he might discourse
things of great concernment with the Commander;
being let in, and listned to by <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas,</hi>
he discreetly began his Speech, cursing the desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his condition, that being Born of <hi>Christian</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
he had like an abortive fruit of Catholick Plants
abjur'd the Faith of his Fathers in vvhich he vvas bred;
that now vvith his Eyes opened he came to Knock at
the Door of the Church, that the Latin Priests might
bring back to the Sheep-fold of Christ, so lost a Sheep;
that this vvas the miserable relation of an uncompos'd
Life; that about the affairs of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> he could
assure him the <hi>Sultan</hi> had news that the <hi>Mogull</hi> vvith a
great Army vvas entred the Confines of his Kingdome,
putting all to the Sword; that <hi>Iuzarcaon,</hi> who had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought thirteen thousand Foot to the Camp, had
orders to joyn vvith <hi>Rumecaon,</hi> and both together go
against the Enemy; that vvith the resolution he
commanded the drawing off the Canon, but that he
should be provided the next day to look for a general
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57115:77"/>
assault, because the <hi>Turks</hi> would not without some
Noise end that Warr. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
and confirm'd his resolutions of turning Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
besides the taking kindly his intelligence, and
again let him down the Wall, to acquaint him with any
new thing that hapned in the Camp.</p>
            <p>112. The news of raising the Siege, with the certainty
of the assault which was to be given, was Nois'd about
the Fortress, and the Souldiers for joy put on that day
their Bravery, some rejoycing at the approach of the
Enemy, others at the end of the Warr. The Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in chief found a great forwardness in all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to expect the assault, for all thinking 'twould be
the last of so long a Siege, every one coveted to give
the latest memory of his Actions.</p>
            <p>113. <hi>Dom Fernando de Castro</hi> kept his Bed of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and hearing of the intended assault,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dom Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> came sick upon the Works.</note> rose, his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
offering violence to Nature; <hi>Dom Iohn Masca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renhas,</hi>
sometimes as his Commander, others as his Friend
went about to hinder it; but Disobedience here passing
for Virtue, he rather offended against Health then
against Honour, putting on his Armour and coming to
the Works.</p>
            <p>114. The day of the glorious Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> broke,
Dedicated by his happy Martyrdome to Fiery trials.
The Gentlemen with so much transport of joy came
to their Posts as if already in possession of Reward
and Victory. They presently saw at a distance the
Enemies Army marching Orderly, and dispersing it
self round about the Fortress.<note place="margin">The Enemy makes shew of an other assault.</note> Our Canon plaid
with no little Execution, the Enemy, Souldier like,
enduring the Charge, rather then discompose the
Order he march't in, till he had gain'd his Post, and
planted Ladders to begin the assault; they fell on
the Works with great resolution, hoping by Fighting
to amuse us, that the confusion of the Conflict might
cover the Stratagem of the Fire they had laid. Our
men shew'd great Bravery, as if in haste to rest
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57115:78"/>
themselves in Victory, promis'd in the issue of that
Day.</p>
            <p>115. The fury of the Sword, without any fear of
that of the Fire, was kept off, in Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Work;
the Enemy fought carelesly, till the sign of springing
the Mine arriving 'em they all at the same time retir'd;
the same fear, equal and suddain in 'em all, discovered
us the Plot. The Commander in chief cry'd out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
for 'em to leave the Work; that the Mine,
now known by the suddain retiring of the Enemy,
might without any hurt take Fire. Every one by leaving
his Post obey'd their Commander, only <hi>Diogo de Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noso</hi>
with disorderly Courage kept the place, calling
them Cowards who quitted it. At those words all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to their Posts, rather following example then

<hi>Dom Diogo de Sottomajor,</hi> flying with a Lance in his

thirteen who came off which their Lives, were
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57115:78"/>
wounded or deform'd by the Fire. Others more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
write the accidents of this Fire. We had rather, then
grieve the attention of those who read the History, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

over this unfortunate Day. Our men wondered to see
the Execution of smothered Powder should be so great,

Enemies Camp, the Fire rather following the impulse
of Nature then the prescrib'd Limits of the Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer.</p>
            <p>116. After some time, when the Fortress was clear'd
from smoak, <hi>Rumecoan</hi> commanded five hundred <hi>Turks</hi>
to enter at the ruins of the fir'd Work, the rest of the
Camp in whole Companies seconding 'em.<note place="margin">The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Courage of five Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> Yet met

the confession of our Enemies themselves, and by the
reverence of so many Years.<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 2. Cap. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi>
with fifteen more came to that quarter to their Relief,
where he beheld two Spectacles, one challenging Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
the other Amasement, and relieving the five,
all together made so stubborn a Resistance, as to stop
the fury of a Victorius Army; such a thing as, related
only with the bare truth, out-does all the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
have in their Histories or Fables.</p>
            <p>117. 'Twas given out in the Fortress that the <hi>Turks</hi>
were Masters of the fir'd Work, upon which, some
Souldiers who fought in the other Posts came thither,
as where the danger was greatest. The false report hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
sav'd the Fortress, for they made a Body capable of
resisting thirteen thousand Foot, so many (as our
Histories reckon) were they, who went on upon the
Min'd work.<note place="margin">The Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Isabel Fernandez</hi> and other Women.</note> The Women, taught not to value their

and the Magnanimous <hi>Isabel Fernandez,</hi> with only a Bill
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57115:79"/>
in her hand, did by her Actions animate the Souldiers,
though much more by her example and words, crying
aloud, Fight for your God, Fight for your King, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valliers
of Christ, for he is on your side. The Enemies,
by the success of the Mine, having so fair a Door open
to Victory, resolv'd that day to conclude the business,
encourag'd by their General, and the opportunity, now
Fighting as own'd by fortune. Those who were on the
Work, (out of ambition to be the first in so eminent
an Action) behav'd themselves the more resolutely,
and being <hi>Ianizaries</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> would have for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
only the honour of the Day. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the re-inforcing the assault in other places, that
against so inconsiderable a strength, diversion might fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
the Entry.</p>
            <p>118. The Fortress was often lost, the Enemy being
numerous and fresh, Ours, besides their being but few,
spent with the labour of so unequal resistance. The
Vicar <hi>Iohn Coelho,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Vicar encourageth the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> holding up a Crucifix, came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
'em, saying, that God whose cause they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
was the giver of Victories, at which sight those
Loyal, and stout Champions, put in Breath again,
seem'd more then men in their Courage, for not one had
any weakness or sence for his Wounds, continuing the
Fight with the same vigour, and boldness, as they begun
it.</p>
            <p>119. Now was the Day declining, and the <hi>Turks</hi>
closely mingled with Ours, now mortally Burnt, out of
the same Wounds each man pour'd his own, and an
others Blood; and by a whole Armies charging on so
few Defendants, our Souldiers receiv'd many thrusts in
the same place. What we relate with truth, may seem
heightned. The great things the <hi>Portuguese</hi> did that
day let the whole <hi>East</hi> speak, I believe, every Stone of
famous <hi>Dio</hi> will be for 'em a silent Epitaph; Our Pen
shall not be ungratefully silent of the Names of those
five Cavalliers we spoke of,<note place="margin">The names of the five Souldiers.</note> who were, <hi>Sebastian de Sa,

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57115:79"/>
               <hi>Mestre Iohn</hi> a Chirurgion. With the Fight ended the day.
<hi>Rumecaon</hi> commanded the sounding a Retreat, after
losing seven hundred men in the assault, the Wounded
were without number, of whom very many Dy'd (for

tyring out the Chirurgions and making scarce the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
<hi>Mestre Iohn</hi> only Dy'd of those five Cavalliers
who kept the VVork, torn in pieces by his many
Wounds, which he sufficiently Reveng'd, unwilling to

so great a Courage, as hath been but seldome seen in the
most resolute.</p>
            <p>120. Upon the Enemy's retiring, <hi>Dom Iohn Masca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renhas</hi>
gave order for the Burying the Dead, which were
in the ruins of the Work, removing them from one
Grave to an other; for the straightness of time and place
they were Buried all together, so honourable Ashes
being without Funeral honours, and Officious tears;
yet rest they, in so poor a Grave, more mist by their
Country, then those who in Alablaster urns have left
of inglorious Lives an idle Memory. <hi>Dom Fernando
de Castro</hi> was laid in a Depository by himself, that if
the Governour his Father would carry his Bones to any
other place, he might make him a more Stately, but not
more glorious Monument. After the Commander in
Chief had with pious Earth covered his Companions,
he fell upon repairing the Breaches the assault had left
in the Walls, help't in it by the VVomen, who had their
share of labour and danger, not reserving time and
place for the grief and tears of their Sons and Husbands,
whom they had seen expiring before their Eyes, and had
themselves Buried, by unheard of examples smothering
the inclinations of Nature.

call'd to Councel those few Companions who had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd

he begg'd of 'em, that, without any regard

how best to Salve their Kings, and their own Honour;
that they would bethink themselves, how the VVorld
stood looking on, and that the whole <hi>East</hi> had their
Eyes upon 'em, as being in a condition to deserve the
greatest Fame, or Infamy; that if 'twere not in their
power to get the Victory, 'twas in it to deprive their

bravely; that they would purchase greater honour, cut
in pieces, then the <hi>Moors</hi> if Victorious; that he had
call'd them together to impart to 'em his Resolution,

being then the four and twentieth of <hi>Iune,</hi> a Season
when those Seas are not Navigable, He, sollicitous for
the danger the Fortress was in, not valuing that of his
Fleet, did by force of Oars sail even under the Waves;
The Whirl-winds were so Tempestuous, and the Seas so
High and Counter as they swallow'd up the Ships;
some with the force of the Weather broke, others lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Masts and Tackling, lay without Steerage at
the mercy of the Sea, Shipping in water on both sides,
without any Government of their Helm. <hi>Dom Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varo,</hi>
resolute in the relief of <hi>Dio,</hi> turn'd too and again,
finding himself every moment so under water, as with
the Ships rowling the Sea beat off her Rudder; yet by

VVeather, after several times venturing into the Gulf,
which he found so High and Stormy, as for saving the

venture on an other. The storm that day encreasing,
the Ship began to drive, and spent two Cabells; the
Vessel being of such consequence, as having in her all

endeavoured to help her, but do the Mariners what
they could, so great was the Storm they could not get
to her, yet did <hi>Antonio Moniz Barretto</hi> put himself in a

desir'd him, to take him with him, <hi>Moniz</hi> excus'd
it, saying, 'twas not convenient he should have so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
a Person for his Companion,<note place="margin">Two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen go for <hi>Dio.</hi>
               </note> who would ecclipse
him: that only for himself he would have that danger,
without any other going in his Boat. <hi>Garcia Rodriguez</hi>
assur'd him he would every where confess, 'twas he who
carry'd him, and give it him under his hand; so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulously
in those times did they manage points of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
<hi>Antonio Moniz,</hi> satisfy'd with that modesty, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<hi>Garcia Rodriguez</hi> to come on Board. <hi>Miguel de
Arnide,</hi> a Souldier of a Gigantick body, and not less in
Gallantry then Stature, seeing them put out to Sea,
cry'd to 'em from the shore, What Gentlemen do you

               <note place="margin">Ib.</note> here's no room for you, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd

            <p>124.<note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Voyage.</note> Those Gentlemen were at Sea in so bad VVea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as all that day and night they Sail'd at the mercy
of the VVinds, the Boat, with her Helm lach't, and
keeping no course, obeying the Seas; the VVaves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
drove 'em on shore, at others made them lose
what they had got, they were with a Bonnet brought
to their main Yard, turning up and down as the Seas
carry'd 'em, which fill'd them so full of water, as very
hardly did they free her with Bucquets; in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
and danger past they the Night, all worn out
with their continual Labour, by the darkness of the
Night and closeness of the VVeather not knowing
where they were; The day broke, but with little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
from the Night, and they were still striving with
the VVaves, till about Evening they came in sight of
the Fortress, so Battered, as, for the ruins, they hardly
made it; they came at last to an Anchor, without the
Sentinels taking notice of it,<note place="margin">They arrive at <hi>Dio.</hi>
               </note> on which they conjectur'd
the Fortress was lost; <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi> call'd so loud to
'em, as being heard by those within, they went with the
news to the Commander in Chief; here 'tis said, that
the Sentinell asking who's there, a Souldier answered,
<hi>Garcia Rodriguez de Tavora,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous jealousie of two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.</note> which <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ill, reply'd, that he was the man came thither,
and, if <hi>Garcia Rodriguez</hi> had not civilly and modestly
tempered <hi>Antonio Monits</hi> just resentment, the Jealousie,
(though time and reason were above so slight Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels)
might have caus'd a greater Breach. <hi>Dom Iohn
Mascarenhas</hi> came to receive 'em, and with embraces told
'em, how much he valued their so seasonable Relief;
he ask't <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi> where <hi>Dom Alvaro de Castro</hi> was,
who in the Souldiers hearing answered him aloud, Sir
you have him here with sixty Sail in <hi>Madrefabat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They tell news of <hi>Dom Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro.</hi>
               </note> and
with the first fair weather you'l see his Streamers; but
between themselves he told him, that, after often put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Sea, being forc't back again, he was yet at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caim,</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:57115:83"/>
but so impatient of his stay there, that he would
not wait for the time of year to come to his Relief;
this news was so entertain'd, that the Souldiers with
Dancing and Capering forgot their past Sufferings, in
their hopes of the Recruit at hand; and those who had
serv'd under <hi>Dom Alvaro,</hi> upon their experience of his
Gallantry, warranted his coming, in spight of the Seas
and VVinds.</p>
            <p>125. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> entertain'd his Guests
on Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> and Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s works, where were
the most ruins, Courting them, who had so well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
from greater dangers, with those pastimes of
VVarr. Our danger was not at that time less, though
less apprehended. <hi>Antonio Monits</hi> sent back the Vessel
he came in to his Cousin-german <hi>Luis de Mello de Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doca,</hi>
who had begg'd it of him; there went on her
some maim'd Souldiers, with Letters for <hi>Dom Alvaro de
Castro</hi> from the Commander in chief, in which he gave
him an account of all had past,<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <hi>Dom Alvaro,</hi>
               </note> telling him in short the
straights we have before related. The Boat came back
to <hi>Bacaim</hi> to the great joy of those who saw her, to
hear the Fortress yet held out for the King, though
that was allay'd with the dreggs of so many being Kill'd,
of whom the most resented was <hi>Dom Fernando de Castro,</hi>
who left behind him in so green Years so ripe a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
<hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> receiv'd it with the constancy of a
Souldier, comforting himself with having his Sword in
his hand to revenge him: and immediately that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commanded the Fleet to put to Sea, with orders
to go away directly for <hi>Dio,</hi>

               </note> and that no Ship should

            <p>126. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> in the interim, seeing greater Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
done by Mines then Assaults,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rumecaon</hi> goes on with the Mines.</note> and having heard,
by some Slaves who fled from the Fortress, of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and Danger; of the grief ours were in for the
miss of so many eminent Persons who were lost in the
Mine, and of the scarcity of Ammunition and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
resolv'd to continue Mining, which was done with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57115:83"/>
less Danger, and more Execution, and in pursuance of
the design, commanded them to Sap at Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s
work, and that part of the Wall which runs about it.
All was done by crooked and cover'd Galleries, to hide
the design from us, and secure the Work-men. <hi>Dom
Iohn Mascarenhas,</hi> cautious, and fore-warn'd, arguing
from the short truce of the Enemy, that he was work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in some other new Mine, affraid too of <hi>Antonio Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canha</hi>'s
work, gave order for the Repairing it, and the
opening some place to Listen at, by which he found
they were working at that part of the Wall,<note place="margin">Our men labour to prevent 'em.</note> which the
Enemy found so strong, as to be proof against his
Tools; an extremity he with Fire and Vinegar over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came.
A proof the Enemies we had to do with in <hi>Asia,</hi>
wanted neither Courage or Discipline, as some falsely
write, who to lessen our Victories, take the Eastern
<hi>Moors</hi> to be Raw and Barbarous; that day they begun to
destroy the Wall, and presently <hi>Rumecaon</hi> commanded,
that 'twixt Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Work and the round Tower
the Mine should be made, which our men knowing,
Counter-mind, and made up a strong Wall within; and
wanting Materials, and VVork-men, those honourable
Matrons help't in so difficult a Work, to favour the
wounded and sick, who could neither endure nor excuse
the Labour.</p>
            <p>127. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> having perfected the Mine, resolv'd
under protection of that, to make a general Assault, and
calling to him the Officers of the Army, and those who
were chose to Scale the VVall, 'tis reported he made
'em this Speech. <q>Those ruins you see, besmear'd
with the Blood of our Fellow-Souldiers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rumecaon</hi> encourageth his men for an other assault.</note> must this
day be our Grave, or our Quarters; they who keep
those shattered VValls are an hundred men, whose
strength is by hunger and wounds so abated, as we
only Fight with the shadows of those who have been
men, who miserably Sacrifice to our Semitars Lives
without Blood. All that honour, they with unhappy
Courage have won in this Siege, is to be Ours; for,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57115:84"/>
from the end of a Warr are the Atchievements nam'd,
and the World gives always the Courage to the last
success; Let's make an end of winning the Fortress,
Let's climb that mount of Triumphs, we shall with
only one Victory revenge infinite Affronts; Let's
deliver this Slave <hi>Asia</hi> from Prisons, and Taxes, Let's
free our Seas, which groan under the weight of their
Fleets; we shall by this Assault make an end of so
glorious a design, and the <hi>East</hi> will for whole Ages
joyfully remember so glorious a Day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>128. Having ended his Speech, he spoke to, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
particular Persons,<note place="margin">They fall upon Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s work.</note> with motives seasonable to
the Time, and Persons, designing rewards to those who
should first Scale the Walls, as would have done the
most prudent and experienc't Commander of <hi>Europe.</hi>
On the same day, the sixteenth of <hi>August,</hi> the Enemy
with all their strength march't out of their Quarters,
and dividing themselves orderly about the Works, left
the main Body of the Army to fall upon Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s,
where they hop't to open the Gate for Victory. Here
they gathered Tumultuously, with rude Crys in their
mouths, and letting fly, in great abundance, Arrows,
and Darts, to summon our greatest strength to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
here the Fight was at the hottest, till in the
height of it, the Enemy, seeming to yield to our resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
as on a sign given, suddainly retir'd; Our men
who had been fore-warn'd, knowing the cheat of their
feign'd fear in which they went off, quitted too the
Work, looking for the springing of the Mine, which
the <hi>Moors</hi> made play, and being resisted by the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and Scarp of the Wall,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 3. Cap. 2.</note> which met with it, it
sprung Recoyling towards the outward face of the
Wall, and the Curtain flying, carry'd it with so great
violence upon the <hi>Moors,</hi> that above three hundred
were Kill'd, and many more Maim'd.</p>
            <p>129. The Fortress was for some time hid in the
Clouds of Powder, and Smoak, so as neither side knew
their loss; as soon as the Air grew thinner, the Enemy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57115:84"/>
came on in Troops to get upon the spoils and ruins of
the Fire, with so much confidence of Victory as they
hindred one the other, droven on out of Covetousness
of reward, or Ambition of honour; yet did Ours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them on their Lances, sending 'em back VVoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to those whom the Mine had destroy'd; after them
came on others, also after a long dispute repell'd
by ours, who were Gall'd with the multitude of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
Darts, and Balls of VVild-fire which came from
the Camp, with which they spoilt some of our men,
and hindred the Souldiers, attent on both dangers, from
the Defence; yet so Burnt and VVounded, not one
quitted the place he kept, where they so Heroically be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
themselves, as is witness'd by the success and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of the Fight. The fire, the <hi>Moors</hi> cast into the
Works, was so great, as Ours fought in live Flames,
which the Commander in Chief remedy'd, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Barrels of water, which mitigated, or put out, the
fir'd Cloaths, and Bodies. The Enemies greatest force
being drawn hither, here it was our men made the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
opposition, which made the Fight the more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
Recruited every moment by the <hi>Moors</hi> with fresh
men, and Re-inforc't with the presence and voice of the
General.</p>
            <p>130. <hi>Antonio Monits Barretto,</hi> and <hi>Garcia Rodriguez
de Tavora</hi> gave here eminent proofs of their Courage,<note place="margin">Ib.</note>
enduring, with more then ordinary constancy, the
weight of the Enemies, shewing, in the extremities both
by Land and Sea, the same Gallantry. A great share
of the honour of the day is due to those, never enough
prais'd Matrons, companions not only in their labour,<note place="margin">The women continue their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note>
but danger. The good Old woman <hi>Isabel Fernandez,</hi>
with a Bill in her hands, by her words, but more by her
example animated the Souldiers; and the others, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Arrows, Lances, and Bullets, either show'd
their own Courage, or assisted it in others.</p>
            <p>131. In the other works, they were not idle; for to
facilitate, by the diversion, the entrance at Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57115:85"/>
where the Mine sprung, there was Fighting in all. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecaon</hi>
gave order to Batter the Church in the Fortress,
which, by being high, might be thrown down, believing
too the offence in that place would be more sensible;
but ours had so receiv'd the Enemy, as they now coldly
and remissly went to Scale the Wall, kept back by the
horrour of our Execution amongst 'em.</p>
            <p>132. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> out of impatience Commanded the
founding a Retreat,<note place="margin">The Enemy retires with loss.</note> leaving above five hundred Dead,
without number the Wounded. Any one of ours
might content himself with the honour he that day
gain'd. That stout Souldier <hi>Miguel de Arnide</hi> so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis'd
himself, as he prov'd even that Body too little
for so great a Soul, and accompanying so vast a Growth
with proportionable Strength, who ere was reach't by
his first blow, excus'd him from a second. <hi>Mojatecaon,</hi>
vvho vvas come to the Army vvith a great Recruit, and
spoke vvith scorn of the valour of the <hi>Portuguese,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mojatecaon</hi> praiseth our mens Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> by
the experience of that day forming an other judgment,
said they vvere vvorthy to command Kingdoms, and
that the VVorlds good fortune consisted in their being
so small in number; for Nature had, like Lyons, made
them few, Locking them up in the Denns of the
<hi>West.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>133. VVe lost that day seven Souldiers, those vvho
vvere Scorch't vvere twenty two; and now the vvell
vvere so few, as not to be enough to help the Wounded,
less able to repair the ruins of the Fortress, for vvhich,
time, Materials and Men vvere vvanting; but <hi>Rume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caon</hi>
finding so tough resistance in the Assaults, had an
other opinion of our strength. At this time three of
our Slaves ran to the Enemy,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rumecaon</hi> hath intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from three of our Slaves who ran away.</note> vvho brought before <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecaon,</hi>
told him, there vvere not threescore Souldiers
in the Fortress, vvho could bear Arms, and those very
much vvore out vvith Hunger, and continual duty of
Labour, and Centries; in vvhom nothing vvas to be
found but obstinacy vvithout force. <hi>Rumecaon,</hi> on the
certainty of this news, resolv'd the next day vvith all
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57115:85"/>
his strength to storm us, acquainted his men with the
condition we were in, and gave order they should all
hear it from the Slaves mouths,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> who running up and
down the Army merrily spread the relation of our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities.</p>
            <p>134. As soon as the Day broke, the Army had orders
to give the Assault;<note place="margin">He gives an other assault.</note> at which, as at the last of the
Warr, every one would be present, some put on their
Bravery, believing they went rather to Triumph then
to Fight. They came out of their Tents with their
Colours flying, playing on diverse Instruments, which
seconded by the noise of the Camp, form'd Barbarous,
and hideous Ecchoes, and having, by the intelligence
we have spoke of, o'recome their fear, as soon as they
came in sight they advanc't to Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s work,
which being almost all thrown down help't them up by
its ruins. The first company who fell on, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Victory, were <hi>Turks,</hi> who, by our mens cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amongst them some Pots of Powder,<note place="margin">Our mens stout resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> were forc't
being all on Fire to retreat. Others came on with the
same fury, and after a long dispute, as the first, gave
back, of whom our Swords had drawn Blood; but
<hi>Rumecaon</hi> not doubting but so continual resistance
would spend us, as Iron which is blunted by cutting, by
the slaughter of his own men guessing at our weakness,
Commanded his Souldiers to go take possession of the
Fortress, which had now none left to oppose 'em. Here
tumultuously fell on a great Body of the <hi>Moors,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
on by their own credulity or the words of the
General. These at their first speed got upon the Wall,
and began body to body to Fight with ours, many and
fresh, against a few, already wearied and wounded; yet
deriving Courage from their gallantry; and necessity,
the last found them as Valiant as the first. Some of the
Enemies falling down, others came in their places, which
often lost the Fortress. Here fell in <hi>Dom Iohn Masca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renhas,</hi>
animating, as a great Commander, his Men, and
Fighting, as the stoutest Souldier, himself; and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57115:86"/>
for all the chances of Warr, had ready all sorts of
Arms; which our men made use of, being by those stout
Women, put into their hands. <hi>Luis de Sousa</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of that Work, shew'd that day great Gallantry.
<hi>Antonio Moniz Barretto, Garcia Rodriguez de Tavora, Dom
Pedro,</hi> and <hi>Dom Francisco de Almeyda,</hi> did things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

            <p>135. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> by the Slaves information, believing
he should find free entrance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rumecaon</hi> falls upon Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> work and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires.</note> Commanded his men to
fall upon Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> work; but those few Defendants
there were, so behav'd themselves, as the Enemy was
forc't vvith loss and shame to retire. <hi>Rumecaon,</hi> amaz'd
at vvhat he saw, said, vve vvere the Instruments of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens

certain Barbarous and Ridiculous expiations, vvent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the appeasing <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and because in storming,
he lost a great many men without success, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
now grown Cowardly, did on the apprehension
of their being so daily Butcher'd, slight their obedience,
he set upon Mining again, as a vvay more effectual or
more secure; and first he commanded the opening some
Loop-holes in the VVall, which divided the Army, and
our Fortress, by vvhich our men receiv'd no little harm,
Fighting as in a plain Field, vvithout the protection of
the VVall, vvhich vvas thrown down; and the showring
of Musquets vvithout any intermission annoy'd us.</p>
            <p>136. He commanded his Souldiers to Batter the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
vvith a great Gun,<note place="margin">He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to break down the Cistern.</note> because that being broke, as
in a necessity past Cure, thirst vvould destroy us; this
Cistern is at the entry of a Street, vvhich vve call the

vvere not fit for Service retir'd; here fell store of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
not vvithout doing mischief to the poor people
vvho fled thither for Protection, and endangering the
Roof vvhich cover'd the Cistern. The Commander in
Chief prevented this fear by ordering an high defence of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57115:86"/>
Wood lin'd with Earth, which secur'd the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of either inconvenience, making holes too in the
common joyning of the Houses, next the Fortress, by
which they supply'd one the other securely.</p>
            <p>137. The <hi>Moors</hi> in the interim work't in the Mine,
vvhich vvas carried to Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s vvork, and being
by Ours found out, they on the inside put strong Abute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and opened some Vents, that the Fire might
spend it self, at the time of springing the Mine, it met
vvith such resistance in the Scarp, that carrying vvith it
part of the Work, it plaid vvithout the Fortress,<note place="margin">An other Mine plays with loss to the Enemy.</note> Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
great numbers of those Souldiers and Miners, vvho
were employ'd in it, not one of Ours miscarrying, by

chance, but that so extraordinary, as it appear'd a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.
The <hi>Moors,</hi> vvhen the Mine plaid, did by vvhole
Companies get up on the ruins of the Work, vvhere
they vvere Resisted by our men, vvorn out by Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
vveakned by their Fasting and Wounds, and more
in Heart by the greatness of their Courage, then the
force of Nature,<note place="margin">The great danger ours were in.</note> yet so animated by honour and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as they seem'd to Fight with fresh, and entire
strength, keeping off the wild Current of the Enemy
with his own loss; The place was of reception for more
to Fight upon, and the danger encreast by the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of the numbers. The noise of Arms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of Crys, interrupted all Commanding, and
Obeying; of the <hi>Moors</hi> many fell, but by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Commanders, others came in their place,
by which they gave Ours no respite, who from a farr
were thrown at by Darts and Arrows, and Fought
clos'd hand to hand. Thus did they for many hours
hold out the Fight. The Enemy gain'd so much as to
plant three Colours on the VVorks,<note place="margin">The Enemy plants three Colours on St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s work.</note> which their great
numbers of Musquetteers defended; thence they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
by the VVall to the Apostle Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s
Church, which joyns to the same VVork, and placed
themselves on the Top of it, so that one half of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57115:87"/>
VVork and Church was kept by the <hi>Moors,</hi> and by us
the other.</p>
            <p>138. The night came on, and not Peace but Nature
put an end to the dispute; yet did they with wandering
and uncertain blows blindly continue the Battail. The
Commander in chief gave presently order for the cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up a weak Work (which more divided then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
us from the Enemy) which was made by stealth,
and with Swords in their hands; the Souldiers had no
other Lodging then the place they fought on, where,
not on their Arms, could they securely take a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
neither had they conveniency of time or place
to dress their VVounds. The Commander indulg'd
himself no rest from his Arms, less from his Thoughts;
He that night Commanded the Levelling a Canon at
the Door of the Church, which commanded the
VVork, and with that gall'd the <hi>Moors,</hi> who while they
kept possession of what they had got, receiv'd no little
loss, till by a high Rampier they cover'd and secur'd
themselves.</p>
            <p>139. The danger by Sea, was not less then that by
Land;<note place="margin">

<hi>Luis de Mello</hi> presently put to Sea, but for the contrary
VVinds made but little way, the further he got off from
the shore, he found the Seas higher, and the Carvel
being but little, and loose, and the VVaves so great, as
by the force of the Storm to break over and flowre her,<note place="margin">The dangers of his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note>

and out of heart, desir'd <hi>Luis de Mello</hi> to stand for his
Port again, saying, that with men they could Fight,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57115:87"/>
but not with the Elements; that 'twas now not Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
but Obstinacy, to lose themselves for nothing;
that against the wrath of God no Bravery could carry
it out. <hi>Luis de Mello</hi> went to quiet 'em, alledging, that
<hi>Antonio Moniz</hi> past in the same Vessel and same Storm;
that he had not with him better men then he, nor did
the Seas shew him more favour; that none without
danger atchiev'd great things; that when their Friends,
and Camrades were Fighting with the <hi>Turks,</hi> they were
not to wait for calm Seas, and fair Winds to go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve 'em;
that though the Waves swallow'd the Ship,
he would, on his Sword swim to <hi>Dio;</hi> that they should
go man the Sails, for God would help.</p>
            <p>140. The terrour, and shame of these words, did for
the present quiet 'em, so as that Evening and Night,
they were striving with the Storm, expecting every
Wave should overset 'em, and now wanting strength to
furnish their Duty, seeing the Tempests likely every
minute to grow bigger, Mariners and Souldiers agreed,
by force to compell <hi>Luis de Mello</hi> to Tack about, which
being told him by one <hi>Gòmez de Quadras,</hi> a Souldier
under his command, he took all the Arms, and laying
'em up in the Gun-room, with his Sword in his hand

his Force to that place, again engag'd with Ours, on
equality in the ground, but advantage in the number;
Here both sides fought it out, Hand to Hand, and Body

every one with his Blood and Life maintaining the
ground he stood upon. Ours with so inferiour a party
shew'd so much Gallanty, as the <hi>Moors</hi> without the

the Enemies force having so much the Odds, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd
that part of the Work he had won before, and
re-inforcing it with a double Garrison, ordered the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a general Assault to the Fortress. The Fight was

day began to over-cast with a great storm of Wind,
Rain, Thunder, and Lightning, as if in the Air was
kindled an other new Battail.</p>
            <p>142. The <hi>Moors,</hi> seeing our Match put out by the Rain,
and that neither our Pots of Powder, nor any other Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
could do them any mischief, looking upon the
course or variety of the Weather as Divine favour, came
under covert in the midst of thick Rain, upon us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear, and with Shouts, and Crys, as if they had Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

shew'd the greatest Courage, and the Fortress was in the
greatest danger;<note place="margin">The danger the Fortress was in, and the Courage of our men.</note> because the <hi>Moors</hi> run upon our

lasted this so resolute Assault, till the day turn'd clear
again, and our men began to make use of their Pots of

cool'd the others Courage, making them Fight more
Cautiously till the close of the Day, and <hi>Rumecaons</hi>

Recruit were in this Assault, giving the same proofs of
their Courage and Birth; <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> play'd
by turns the prudent Commander and stout Souldier,
always present in danger, without prostituting his
Command. Our men past that night with Watching,

            <p>144. <hi>Rumecaon,</hi> having notice there were already ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd

                  <hi>Rumecaon</hi> despairs of the design.</note> and thinking when

to assist one the other in the greatest Dangers,
began to despair of the design, seeing hardships shook
not our mens Resolutions,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 3. Cap. 4.</note> and that his Souldiers in their
Discourses did not allow the cause of the Warr, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Breakers of that Peace we kept so inviolably;
He was afraid of some dispositions he saw for a mutiny,
which, by aggravating the miserable condition of
Ours, and the infallibility of their Victory, he Labour'd
to prevent. He paid the Souldiers, and commanded the
<note n="*" place="margin">They are Judges, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and Governours of Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> 
               <hi>Cacizes</hi> to Preach the certainty of Glory for all those
who Dy'd in this Warr, and the Rewards, which for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
their Country, they were to receive from the
<hi>Sultan,</hi> not forgetting to joyn the Temporal, with the
Spiritual. And Mines not being so Dangerous as
Storming, and of more Execution, he resolv'd to go on
with them; on this design, he commanded the opening
a great Mine, in that tract of the VVall which from
Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> work goes untill it end in <hi>Antonio Pecanha</hi>'s
Centry-house; but our men being caution'd (though
subtil, and contriving <hi>Rumecaon,</hi> sap't under the other
VVorks,<note place="margin">He opens an other Mine, which is prevented.</note> commanding his men by night to make a noise
there, by that diversion to keep from us his intention)
<hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> had notice of the Mine, against
which, as at other times, he secur'd himself, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
working to prevent it, whose example eas'd the
Labour of the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>145. VVhen 'twas time to spring the Mine, the
whole Army mov'd,<note place="margin">It plays and our men defend the Breaches.</note> and begun to surround the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress;
there came before two <hi>Sanjacks</hi> commanding a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57115:89"/>
Company of <hi>Turks,</hi> who were to enter at the Breaches
presum'd upon at the playing of the Mine, which with
a hideous Noise carry'd into the Air the whole face of
the Wall; The <hi>Turks,</hi> though blind with Smoak, and
Dust, (the force of the Fire had rais'd) ran presently
on, but found the opposition of an other VVall, the
Fire either had not reach't, or had prov'd too strong;
yet seeing <hi>Antonio Pecanha</hi>'s Watch-house open in three
places, carrying thither their Arms, they endeavoured
to gain it; but our men, as to the weakest place came to
its Relief, stopping the Current of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>146. Here the dispute was for a while close and hot,
the Besiegers and Besieg'd, as it were Fighting in a plain
Campagnia, and <hi>Rumecaon</hi> believing, that there was
all our force, Commanded 'em to fall on the other
VVorks, where too the Portuguese entertain'd 'em with
their Swords. The Enemy that day shot infinite Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
into the Fortress, which, though That was almost
raz'd, did no harm, an accident which for its rareness
look't like a miracle.<note place="margin">The Enemy retires.</note> The Fight lasted some hours, the
Enemy retiring with his usual loss, we with our ordinary
good fortune.</p>
            <p>147. <hi>Rumecaon,</hi> who now thought himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
by the length of the Siege, as one who to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
himself, went in quest of dangers, and difficulties,
the next day in Person fell upon Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s work,
commanding several Officers to Scale the other vvorks,
which made those days Storming go for a successive
assault.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rumecaon</hi> falls upon St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s work.</note> The <hi>Moors</hi> fought here, more Desperately then
Valiantly, making haste, though run through with
Lances, and Swords at once, to Dye, and Kill; readier
to offend, then save themselves, seeking Death as the
gate to that imaginary Glory, promis'd 'em by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cizes,</hi>
who in favour of the design, and to beget in the
Souldiers a contempt of their Lives, continually prest
that Diabolical incentive. In this heat, did they for
some hours endure the Crisis of the Battail, with the
loss of fourscore, upon whose Bodies they continued
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57115:90"/>
Fighting, forc't on by the grief and loss of their slain
Camrades. They in fine behav'd themselves with such
resolution, as to keep that part of the VVork where the
Fight was, planting on it their Colours, covering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with Trenches and Barricados.</p>
            <p>148. The dispute in Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s work was not
cooler, the Enemies had twice got it, but met with so
gallant a resistance,<note place="margin">How it went in St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s work.</note> as at no little expence of Blood
they again lost it; The fire the Enemy cast amongst us
here was so much, that our men fought in Flames, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no other remedy for their Relief, then to cool
themselves in Barrils of water. <hi>Antonio Moniz Barretto,</hi>
was, with but two other Souldiers on the VVork, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
the fury of the Enemy, and <hi>Moniz,</hi> stepping off
to allay the heat of the Fire in the Barril, was seis'd on
by one of 'em, saying, Ah Signior <hi>Moniz,</hi> will you let
the King's work be lost? I'me all on Fire (answered he)
and go to bathe in the Tubbs, if your Arms (reply'd
the Souldier) are well enough to Fight, all the rest is
nothing; whose hints <hi>Moniz</hi> accepted, so pleas'd with
the Souldiers courage as he got him his discharge, and
brought him with him for <hi>Portugall,</hi> generously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
his own backwardness, to the others advantage,
and always calling him by an honourable Title, The
Souldier of the Fire; neither do the relations of this
Action, make him known to us by any other name.</p>
            <p>149. In this, and the other VVorks they this day
fought,<note place="margin">The Enemy retires again.</note> with equal courage and danger, which we will
not particularly relate, because the Circumstances do
so agree, as looking like the same thing repeated, the
Writing, and Reading would be tedious; yet, though
the relation of this Siege doth not by its variety delight,
who will deny this Action to be one of the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in human Story, which as so was valued by the
most Warlick nations of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Europe?</hi> Upon the
Enemies retiring, we fortify'd our selves in the ruins of

                  <hi>Antonio Correa</hi> goes out to look for some Prize.</note>
a Souldier of great Courage, whose Birth (but by his

but as stout Souldiers satisfie not themselves
with brave unless successfull Actions, <hi>Correa</hi> (more des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate

times on the same Errand; but that which seem'd
chance, was Mystery, and Heaven decreed or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the stout Souldier should be obstinate in the
design, who is to blame himself if his own fault pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
his misfortune. He in fine, with too importune
Curiosity, return'd, to provoke or know his Fortune,
and standing up with the Island, perceiv'd a Fire at a
distance, which made it seem less, but Rowing towards
that place, leaving his Companions in the Boat, went
on Shore, and walk't a while alone, till the light of the

Companions, bidding 'em leave their Boat, for now
they had in their power the Prize they sought for, yet
the Souldiers, either forgetting themselves, or Ministers
of an higher providence, went not with him, making
way for their Commanders fortune, who seeing the

having heart enough to go attempt that danger, he

of their Prize, shewing the VVounds they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.</p>
            <p>151. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> commanded he should be loos'd,

               </note> if the

force, and in what time his Son was expected? he with
great assurance answered him, that there were in the
Fortress six hundred men, who were every day earnest
with the Commander to lead 'em forth to the Camp;
that they very shortly look't for <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> to come
with fourscore Vessels, who upon his arrival would
Sally forth into the Campagnia, because some Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
he brought with him wanted <hi>Turkish</hi> Slaves;
that the Governour was preparing greater Forces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
at once he would determine the business of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya.
Rumecaon</hi> who knew the truth of our strength,
envy'd so brave a Soul in so low Fortune, and esteeming
him as a Souldier, who in Chains despis'd him, ask't him
to turn <hi>Moor,</hi> that he might in a better Religion have
better Fortune,<note place="margin">Who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades him to change his Religion.</note> and know the difference there was
'twixt serving a rich Monarck, and poor Pyrats. The
stout Cavallier scandalis'd at the Affront of so base Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities,
told him, The <hi>Portuguese</hi> were always ready to
shed their Blood for their Religion, and King; that
<hi>Mahamed</hi> was an Impostor, infamous for his Actions and
Doctrine; that if there were in <hi>Cambaya</hi> any Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gados,
they were of other Nations, as was his Father
<hi>Coge-Sofar,</hi> whom, as a Monster of the place he was
Born in, his Parents and Country own'd not as their

            <p>152. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> not able to endure from a Slave the
affronts of his Religion and Person,<note place="margin">How he useth him.</note> kindled with
Zeal and Contempt, commanded, that before taking

then against Humanity; yet did this Souldier of Christ
(like one, now a Souldier of an other Militia) with
a softer Courage overcome by suffering. <hi>Rumecaon,</hi>
after these affronts, saying, his Prophets honour deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Beheaded, and the Palm, he deserv'd as a Souldier, he
obtain'd as a Martyr; his Head was put upon a Pike,
and set, where from the Fortress our men might see it,
who as Souldiers, out of a natural but unjust Compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
vow'd to revenge his Blood, as Catholicks, envy'd
his Death. The next day, those who were in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
return'd, whom the Commander, respecting the
time, would neither see or punish; yet did they expiate
their fault, by venturing on all occasions, like men who
loath'd Life without honour. Many of 'em accus'd by
their Conscience, design'd their own Death. The
<hi>Moors</hi> at a distance mock't and geer'd at us, pointing at
<hi>Antonio Correa</hi>'s Head, recompensing so many losses with
that satisfaction, and grown by it more daring, did in
contempt of us some extraordinary Actions.</p>
            <p>153. Between Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s and Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s work
was our Colours planted; which one of the <hi>Moors</hi>
(believing he could without danger effect it, the Wall
being Low, and not Guarded) had a mind to take
away; coming by stealth and unseen of our men,
getting up by the Ruins, he got hold of the Staff, and
though he by forcing mov'd it, yet could he not carry it
away, and quitting out of fear his hold left it Leaning;
seeing how little his first attempt cost him, return'd
with the same Caution in quest of the Colours, and as
he was reaching out his Arm to take hold of it,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 3. Cap. 5.</note> one of
our Souldiers with a Musquet-shot Kill'd him. This
hapned in face of the Camp, who for his first exploit
entertain'd him with Shouts and Praises, now look't
upon him falling with a profound silence. Ours ran in
great haste to cut off his Head, which they so planted,
as with it to confront <hi>Antonio Correa's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>154. The <hi>Moors</hi> who were fortify'd in Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s

not willing to have it at the Courtesie of the Seas, to

               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:57115:93"/>
took up his quarters in the Work vvhere his Brother
<hi>Dom Fernando</hi> fell, those who formerly had been under
his Command came to serve under <hi>Dom Alvaro,</hi> and
most of the Gentlemen, some as having bore a part in
the sorrow for his Brother, others in his Victories; all too
vvould take the word from him, as Admiral at Sea, not
one being vvilling to be exempted from his Command,
a thing contrary to the Time, and more to Discipline;
yet <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> told the Commander, he came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
orders from him, which <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi>
taking for a Civility, answered vvith the same Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
but <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> shew'd him his instructions, which

Honour he had gain'd in that Siege so requiring it; a

Fame, he vvith his Blood help't to purchase, greater

There vvere now six hundred men in the Fortress, all

bigness, which the Commander was earnest to
get up into the Fortress, and imploying Ropes and
Machines, found it impossible, desiring so at least to
secure it, as the Enemies might make no use of it, he
ordered it to be ty'd there with great Cords. The <hi>Moors</hi>
continued digging under the Walls of the Work, and
striking on the bottom Stones, by the failing of the
Foundation the VValls fell down, the great Gun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining

the first day of their seeing the Enemy, they charg'd
him with such Vigour, as he was forc't to retire, leaving
many of his men on the place. In the height of the
Fight, some of 'em fasting a great Cabell to the Gun
dragg'd it off, unseen of Ours, who engag'd in the Fight,
did not take notice what the <hi>Moors</hi> were doing.</p>
            <p>161. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> did vigilantly attend

knowledge of <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi>'s Souldiers, warn'd by the

Gentlemen, and Souldiers, who were Burnt to Death,
they all agreed to Sally out and Fight the Enemy, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

'twas certain.</p>
            <p>162. They said they would not by their useless obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
be Burnt to Death, when they might Dye in the
Field, with Victory or Revenge; that knowing how to
Fight like men, they would not perish like Beasts, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

that they might overcome, then that they could not
avoid.<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander goes about to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade 'em,</note> 
               <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas,</hi> first by Reason, then by
the Authority of his Place, and Person, did what he
could to disswade 'em, but in vain, because (as their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57115:94"/>
crime had some semblance of Virtue) they were proud
of it, and expected rewards and praises for their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.
<hi>Dom Alvaro de Castro</hi> help't to keep 'em

                  <hi>as do</hi> Dom Alvaro <hi>and</hi> Dom Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco</note> saying,
the King would be more sensible of the disobedience
of one Souldier, then the loss of a Fortress; that it
belong'd only to the Commander to Govern, to them
to Obey and Fight. <hi>Dom Francisco de Menezes</hi> told 'em
they were the first who would Defame the name of
<hi>Portuguese;</hi> that they would go with their Honour lost,
their Lives in no little danger, and though they scap't
the arms of their Enemy, they could not free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the just anger of their King, whom, by so
base a Mutiny, they in the Person of his Commander,
despis'd. For all this, with a fatal resoluteness did they
provide to give Battel, saying, no fault could be such,
as Victory would not excuse, and if they were lost, they
were exempt from reward or punishment; that they
stood up for the honour of the State, whose Custom,
was rather to take places on the <hi>Moors,</hi> then lose its

having left 'em for their Counsellour that so short time

They, by a fatal unanimity, all rose resolute and ready

in danger of Life, which lasted those days
Philosophy calls Decretory or Critical; yet his pain
abated, and <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> recovered his health, to the

more pliable, having by this days experience
lost a great deal of that fear they had of our Arms; he
presently sent the <hi>Sultan</hi> news of the Victory, which was

He presently commanded his men to go on with
the design against our Work, stealing the Earth from
underneath, that being unfurnish't the weight might
sink it, by the failing of the Foundation on which it
rested, <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> deluded this Plot, by
ordering an other Fort to be made within, which took
a less compass, and by containing less Earth was fitter
for defence. This could not be hid from <hi>Rumecaon,</hi>
who brought thither a great party of <hi>Moors,</hi> these with
Stones, Darts, and Balls of Wild-fire, did without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
charge our Work-men, some sure of their aim
in those places the Wall discovered, others by casting
over it, by which they Wounded our men, more intent
on their Work then Defence, to avoid which, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander

the Warr shew'd him in the last Fight, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Governours coming, every day expected,
began (as one who would in his imaginary Victory
already enjoy the ease of Triumph) to Build a new
City;<note place="margin">Builds a new City.</note> whether 'twere to put his men in heart, or as a

imagin'd successes. He made Palaces for himself, with
that Order and Grandeur, the wantonness of Peace
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57115:96"/>
would have allow'd off; He set out quarters for the
Officers, by that, obliging 'em to defend their own
Dwellings, shewing in the Fabrick, no less Skil, then
Pride: He ordered the laying Boats across in that place
of the River which goes from the Custom-house to
the Town of <hi>Rumes,</hi> which being made fast with great
Cabels, he fill'd equally with Earth, o're which, (as
on a Bridge not steady, but secure) the Carts which

and he as most concern'd, seeing the necessity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging

(only diverted by the business and preparations of the

when News was brought him, there was come to the

Cunha,</hi> and <hi>Alvaro Barradas.</hi> The Governour thought
<hi>Dom Manoel de Lima</hi>'s arrival very considerable, for the
Person, and the necessity; he came Commander of the
Fortress of <hi>Ormus,</hi> which the King had given him to
put by some animosities which were 'twixt him and the
Governour <hi>Martin Affonso de Sousa,</hi> whose return from
<hi>India</hi> he expected, to demand satisfaction of him for
some injuries. These disgusts the King took up, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
as a Father in the peace of both his Subjects.
<hi>Dom Manoel</hi> would presently have been gon for <hi>Dio,</hi>
with three hundred Souldiers at his own Charge; but
the Governour disswaded him, desiring his Company in
his Fleet, and his Courage and Experience in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement

to enquire after their Children, Friends and Kindred,

had been weakness, and to have the common affections

<hi>Luis de Almeyda</hi> Boarded the great Ship, which had

and reverence of the State, desir'd first to sound and try

               </note> for this he call'd before
him the Ecclesiastical and Civil Government of the
City, with the Gentlemen and Souldiers of Eminency,
to whom he declar'd his Resolution to go in Person to
raise the Siege of <hi>Dio,</hi> and to Fight <hi>Rumecaon</hi> in his
own Quarters; that though all knew it; in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
he had a mind to tell it 'em in common, that in
the approbation of the Common-wealth, he might
carry with him the Justice of the cause as part of the
Victory. Upon hearing the Governour, every one was
affected, in the first place with his Modesty, that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
an Independent Minister; then his great Zeal,
that upon the yet reaking Blood of his Children, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifis'd
his own Life for the Service of his Country.
Upon giving their Votes in the business, their discourse
was various; <hi>Dom Diogo de Almeyda Freire,</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in Chief in <hi>Goa,</hi> whose experience was, by his Years
and the chances of Warr, enlarg'd, did thus deliver his
Opinion.</p>
            <p>181. <q>The small force we now have,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dom Diogo de Almeyda</hi>'s opinion to the contrary.</note> is by their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of it formidable to our Enemies, all <hi>Asia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
our strength, more by our Victories, then our
Souldiers, so that the Fame only of what is past,
keeps us up at present. Your Excellency hath in this
Fleet brought together all the Power of <hi>India,</hi> in
which we can hardly reckon two thousand <hi>Portuguese,</hi>
and with so little Noise we design to fright the whole
World. This Tree of the State (on whose Branches
hang so many Trophies gain'd in the <hi>East</hi>) hath its
Roots by infinite Leagues sever'd from its Body; its
best way of preserving 'em, is by being underprop't,
with Peace with some, and Awe from others. We
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57115:99"/>
can never perform what is expected from our joyn'd
Forces, for one Victory will add but little to our
Reputation, and only one loss Destroys us. We have
already Reliev'd our Fortress, and to what end on a
Wound already Cur'd, to spend the Medicine which
is to serve for others? what new Prudence teaches
us in one only Fight to venture what hath been got
by so many Victories? we have an Army sufficient
as we are to maintain us so, not strength when we are
lost to repair us. No great Souldier without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
ever gave a Field-battail, for where on both
sides the loss useth to be equal, the Conquerour
only keeps the Field and a useless Glory. At <hi>Dio</hi> we
neither covet, or can possess any thing but the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress;
with what blind Madness go we then to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
that with our Blood which is our own already?
what new Colonies have we to Plant the Island? from
what part of the World can we bring others who
are not <hi>Moors</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> as fickle in their Loyalty to
the State, as those who now oppose us? We go to
Fight <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> exceeding us in Numbers,
equal in Arms, and Discipline; if we have the worst
of it, we have no place to save our selves in, for the
Country is theirs; if we have the better on't, no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
will come of the Victory. We have with our
Fleets Conquer'd <hi>India,</hi> with them must we keep it,
having the advantage of Vessels and Mariners. If we
look for Victory only in Fights, lets slight our Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and dismantle our Cities; if 'tis told me, 'tis for
the States honour, to destroy a Kingdome for an
affront, if all who have ta'ne Arms against us, had
receiv'd strict Punishment, the <hi>East</hi> had been already
unpeopled. Shall we blame <hi>Affonso de Albuquer que</hi> for
not Burning <hi>Ormus,</hi> after so many Hostilities and
Treacheries of its Kings and Governours? shall he
forfeit the great Name he atchiev'd there, because for
the Affronts and Quarrels of the <hi>Samorim,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
not <hi>Malabar?</hi> shall <hi>Nuno de Cunha</hi> stain that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57115:100"/>
Renown'd fame for not making Warr upon <hi>Cambaya,</hi>
after the Treason of <hi>Badur?</hi> shall we set upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the <hi>Turk</hi> for his <hi>Bashaw</hi>'s daring to Besiege
our Fortress? shall we set out our Fleets against
<hi>Achem,</hi> because he hath so often invaded us in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca?</hi>
shall we put to Fire and Sword <hi>Hidalcaon,</hi> for
his taking every day our Provisions, and infesting our
Lands of <hi>Bardes</hi> and <hi>Salsete?</hi> what despair drives us
to offer the innocent States throat to the Enemies
knife. This Fleet, so terrible in appearance, so weak
in effect, is a bridle to <hi>Rumecaon,</hi> to Ours a Defence;
but upon Landing so few Souldiers, the <hi>East</hi> will see
into the secret of our Forces, and all the Princes
endeavour to break down those weak Prisons in which
we keep 'em Fettered. <hi>Quintus Fabius Maximus</hi>'s
winning many Battails was the glory of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, his avoiding one was its preservation. The
first Conquerours built us a House, we have nothing
to do but to keep it. If by storming <hi>Dio</hi> the Enemy
have lost an Army, what wants that action of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory?
what of Punishment? Offence is undertaken
with equal strength, Vengeance with farr greater;
for to get satisfaction for one Affront, we are not to
venture a fresh injury, the rather, because Fortune
is in nothing so absolute as in the chances of Warr.
Victories are many times gotten by light accidents,
and lost by others. Will it be then just to put to the
Contingency of Success the Scepter of the <hi>East,</hi>
founded, with the dread and envy of Nations, upon
so many Victories? If we lose this Fleet in which is
amas'd together the whole strength of <hi>India,</hi> what
Treasures hath his Majesty laid up to set forth an
other? we shall begin again, to Petition, or Conquer
the Princes of <hi>India;</hi> we shall bring back to its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
this Empire now grown Old; we shall Live on
the Courtesie of those Crowns we have provok't,
remaining their miserable Vassals, of whom we were
once Masters.</q>

Patience in particulars a Virtue, in Crowns a

                  <head>The Infante Dom Lewis's Letter.</head>
                  <p>5. <q>HOnourable Governour. By your Letters to
my Lord the King, and my self, I have seen
an account of your Voyage from your parting from
<hi>Mocambique</hi> till your arrival in <hi>India,</hi> and what you did
there till the departure of the Ships; the condition
you found the Country in, the quality of the Persons,
the Licentiousness of Trade, the weakness of the
Fleet; how you behav'd your self to <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> in the
business of <hi>Meale;</hi> how in the affairs at <hi>Ormus;</hi> and
how to those Gentlemen, who were permitted by
<hi>Martin Affonso</hi> to carry thither Commodities; and
what more you said in those Letters; and because my
Lord the King answers all those things particularly,
I will not do the same but in short. Yet cannot I
forbear telling you, how I was here on Shore frighted
at the danger you scap't about the Island <hi>Comaro;</hi>
'twas seriously a great and wonderfull fortune, and
which I take as a good Omen, it seeming to me, God
in that would shew you he was to preserve you in the
difficulties of <hi>India,</hi> for which no less a miracle is
necessary, then that shew'd you in your scaping so
eminent a danger, for which I have given hearty
thanks and am glad to hear <hi>Dom Ieronimo de Noronha</hi>
bore you Company in it, since God hath likewise pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
him, and 'tis for a man of his honour to share
in the extremities and troubles of his General. As
to the other things you write me, My Lord the King's
answer being particular, and I present at the dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
'twere I think too precise to write 'em to you
over again; for by his Letters you'l see his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57115:103"/>
in the way you design in those parts for his
Service, and in the good opinion the Country hath of
you, which he particularly commends to your care
in all businesses; what in that I have more to tell
you, is, that I'me very much satisfy'd with your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of affairs in that place, and with your
words as well as actions, for by those 'tis seen the
crossing so many Climates hath not altered you from
your self, or my constant opinion, which, you are not
content in shewing, by your actions, but your words
are a pledge you will continue doing the same, of
which I'me very well assur'd, that what by humane
power can be compast you will truly perform. His
Majesty is not less satisfy'd with your manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
for your Letters came well digested, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
nothing superfluous, and by 'em is sufficiently
seen what I said before, that you both know what
you are to do, and have a desire and earnestness to do
it, without any temporary respect of interest or
affection, which I not a little rejoyce at to hear from
you; for though I am sure of your actions, 'tis yet a
sign of the great abundance of your heart and
virtue, your coveting to say so, which makes me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
God will perfect all your good desires, and
bring you out of that Country, to your great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and honour, for he cannot be unsuccessfull
who designs nothing but the service of God and his
King; and though that is to be purchas'd with no
ordinary difficulty, let me mind you, that 'tis there
resides merit, and that Our Saviour Christ was by
that to enter into his Glory; and if things appear
to you above your Mastery, remember, 'tis there God
puts in his helping hand, and seconds those who serve
him with your attention; and that men of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
can furnish nothing but will and diligence,
which made Saint <hi>Paul</hi> attribute to himself nothing
but the planting, because God is to give the increase,
as he will give it to all those undertakings you plant
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57115:104"/>
with that zeal, I'me secure you have in all your
actions; therefore be not frighted at great things, or
slight little, poise equally, and remit the end to God
Almighty; and though some things succeed not as
you desire, be not transported by despair, while you
act with a just zeal, and clear intention, because God
often permits his servants to commit errors, thereby
to merit by their patience and trust in him, and for
the increase of their experience and perfection; do
justice according to your Conviction, always taking,
as you use, counsel and advice in business; preserve
your self in that clearness you practice in the temporal
injoyments, and advantages of that Country, then
happen what will, all will tend to a good end. Be
very exact in what relates to Divine worship for the
Conversion of the Infidels, for that's the Armory
must chiefly defend <hi>India.</hi> Endeavour to Banish
thence men's extravagant expences, the Effeminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Luxury they Live in, and the excess of
Cloaths and Furniture, disposing them to't mildly,
and winningly, by your own and your Sons example;
and by Countenancing and Favouring those whose
practice is contrary; and if those things be above
your reforming let it not trouble you, because the
corruptions of time, must by time have their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and cannot be remedy'd on a suddain; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
therefore your good intention, managing things
according to the disposition of the time and persons
you have to do with, so, I hope in God, he will (as
you desire) direct all things, to his, and my Lord the
King's service and your honour. For your request,
of my solliciting your stay there may be short, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you have no little reason for your desire, but
my opinion is, it cannot be set upon till seeing your
Letters, which God willing we shall receive this year,
I therefore deferr answering that point till the next
year. I have spoke to the King in the business you writ
me about your Son <hi>Dom Alvaro,</hi> his Majesty knows
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57115:104"/>
him well, and is well inform'd of the qualities of his
Person, and desires to honour and favour him, yet
for some reasons his Majesty hath commanded to be
writ you; and as himself writes, that this year he signs
no Grants, he hath thought fit not to answer that
till the next; in the mean time, he hath sent
Commands for conferring on him that honour, you 'l
find in his Letters Patent. I' me very carefull of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him in mind of all that concerns your Sons, and
hope in God 'twill be so ordered, that you shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from his Majesty honour and reward, as also
your Sons, whom he desires to use according to your
Deservings; and you may be confident his Majesty
very well knows your will to serve him, and is very
much satisfy'd with your way of doing it hitherto. I
spoke to his Majesty about <hi>Affonso de Rojas,</hi> and on
your consideration he immediately granted, what I
ask't him, but (as I said) because he tells those
who go to the <hi>Indies</hi> that this year he signs no Grants,
he hath diferr'd <hi>Affonso de Rojas</hi> business till the next,
and saith, he will then reward him. I'le take care by
the grace of God, to send you the Letters Patent, and
am very glad of the good News you tell me of <hi>Affonso
de Rojas,</hi> and am apt to believe, that being Mr. <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medo</hi>'s
Brother, and in our Company, he must prove
an honest man. What you sent me on the Ships
which came, was delivered me, I was very glad of it,
and value it as coming from your hands.</q>

            <p>6. <hi>Dom Manoel de Lima</hi> setting Sail from <hi>Bacaim</hi> went
by Night into the River of <hi>Surat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The hurt <hi>Dom Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noel</hi> doth about <hi>Surat.</hi>
               </note> and getting up with
the Tide came in sight of a great Village, which, though
not Inhabited by the <hi>Abissines,</hi> had its name from 'em;
the Village was on the <hi>East</hi> side of the River, spread on
a great Plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, though in an open place, had
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57115:105"/>
two thousand Families,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 3. Cap. 9.</note> defended (without any other
Fortification) only by some Trenches, on confidence
perhaps of their first beginning the VVarr, and the
strength of that Army they had in the Field. <hi>Dom Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noel</hi>
went on shore, and our men, in the same order they
Landed, fell upon the Enemy with more Courage then
Discipline. The <hi>Moors</hi> were stout enough to expect,
not to resist, less scar'd by their apprehension of our
men, then the horrour of their own who first fell;
whose Blood so frighted 'em, as they turn'd their backs.
Many were cut off in the Flight, few in Resistance; the
Slaughter was great, the Souldiers Sword sparing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sex or Age. <hi>Dom Manoel</hi> commanded his men to
Fire the Houses, burning together Town and Estates;
Covetousness was below their fury; only one <hi>Moor</hi>
had his Hands ordered to be cut off, who was left Alive
not to carry the News without signs of Victory.</p>
            <p>7. The Fleet went out of the River,<note place="margin">He destroys the City of <hi>Antote,</hi>
               </note> and Coasting
along two days came in sight of the City of <hi>Antote,</hi>
famous for its proud Buildings, and rich Inhabitants,
whom their commerce by Sea had well enrich't;
these, warn'd by others sufferings, resolv'd to Defend
their Houses, or Dye in 'em, valuing so equally their
Lives and Fortunes. <hi>Dom Manoel</hi> got on Shore, though
not without loss; for the <hi>Moors</hi> waited for us, showing
themselves Souldiers in their Resolution, not in their
Conduct, who charg'd us divided into Companies, with
wandring and uncertain Shot, betraying the same fear
in their Resistance, they did afterwards in their Flight.
<hi>Dom Manoel</hi> got ground of 'em, till he forc't 'em into
the City, where, at the sight of Women and Children,
they were made stand by their Compassion; here our
men thought they had to do with Enemies, for they
fought, with the Bowels of Fathers, Cowards in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their own, stout in protecting the Lives of others;
but their Courage not being natural, and proceeding
from tender or timerous affections, their compassion
yielded to their fear, which gave us possession of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57115:105"/>
City, Children, and Victory; and <hi>Dom Manoel,</hi> more
designing Ruine then Conquest, gave up the City to
the Flames. The cruelty out-went the destruction, for
many <hi>Bramenish</hi> young Ladies, exempted from crime by
their Sex, from the Sword by their faces, in Colour and
Beauty not inferiour to those of our <hi>Europe,</hi> were not
spar'd in the Victory.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Dom Manoel de Lima</hi> went Coasting all the Bay of
<hi>Cambaya,</hi> destroying the Towns,<note place="margin">And other places, and retires.</note> so depopulating every
place, as to seem not to be glutted, with Blood or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;
at last retires with more Glory then Booty, and
found the Governour with all the Fleet together at the
Island <hi>Dos Mortos,</hi> the next day (the sixth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>)
they set Sail for <hi>Dio,</hi> the Ships went light, and
with the multitude of Pendants and Streamers, made a
pleasant and beautifull sight.</p>
            <p>9. At the Fortresses making the Fleet,<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour arrives at <hi>Dio.</hi>
               </note> such was the
general satisfaction, as of men who after such a deluge
of Blood, saw those who brought 'em Peace in Victory;
the Fortress was round about full of Colours, the raz'd
Ruins putting on contentment. The Commander in
chief gave order for Shooting off all the Guns; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
by the Governour from Sea with an amazing
Vollee, seconded by Instruments of Warr and Musick,
solemnizing so frightfull a day with chearfull Vespers,
the <hi>Moors</hi> too discharg'd a great many Pieces, shewing
their joy or contempt for the Governours arrival.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi> kept that Night at Sea,<note place="margin">He holds a Council at Sea.</note> and
sent for on Board, the Commander in chief, <hi>Garcia de
Sa, Manoel de Sousa de Sepulveda, Iorge Cabral,</hi> and
other Gentlemen of the Councel, whom he acquainted
with the resolution he came with, to Fight the Enemy,
upon which he ask't no mans Opinion, because the
Governour of <hi>India</hi> drew not his Sword to Defend but
Chastise, but in what manner he should fall upon the
Enemy, he desir'd all their Counsels; <hi>Garcia de Sa,</hi> with
such reasons, approv'd, and prais'd his fix't Resolution,
as for his Person, and their weight were very taking
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57115:106"/>
with the Governour. They discourst about the way of
Fighting, and concluded of it, which was a secret till
the Execution. 'Twas ordered the men should in the
silence of the Night, be put into the Fortress; and on
their Landing, Musick, Trumpets, and Shooting from
the Ships should keep the design from <hi>Rumecaon.</hi> The
men in three Nights by Ladders of Cords got into the

Camp seven hundred <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> who proudly desir'd
to Fight by themselves, that the <hi>Moors</hi> might see who
gave 'em the Victory. <hi>Rumecaon</hi> supply'd the Posts, and

place where he thought our Fleet would Anchor; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did his Confidence disturb his Discipline. Thus
expected he to be falln upon by us, ready for Defence,
doubtfull of Success.</p>
            <p>12. The Governour having now got all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
into the Fortress, found diverse Opinions about
falling on the Enemy, and all the Arguments striking on

or rejected, without the knowledge of what's to come,
known to no body. <hi>Garcia de Sa,</hi> by the Authority of
his Years Courage and Birth, discourst again about the
conveniency of Fighting; but <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi>
commanding silence said,<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour resolves to Fight.</note> that the Lot was already
cast, that by the Valiant he should be well thought of,
and from Cowards he car'd not for approbation; that
those without should expect the success to give their
judgments. He spent that Evening in disposing the
Souldiers for the next day, not to alter by delay their
Courage or Resolution;<note place="margin">His orders to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Fleet.</note> He gave order the Fleets
Boats should for a sign expect three Roquets to be
fir'd from the Fortress, and, at the same time our men
resolv'd to Sally forth, Row toward that place of the
Enemy which was most Obnoxious, with Drums and
Trumpets sounding, crediting what they could their

Boats with Lances, which would make the Stratagem
probable, and that the Governours Boat should, by its
place, Flagg Royal, and Adornments, be known at a

our Victory.</p>
            <p>13. The day broke, which began the eleventh of
<hi>November,</hi> Dedicated to the memory of the glorious
Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tours,</hi> who might, as a Saint
favour, as a Souldier fight for us. The Governour, with
the first Light, came with his Generals staff on the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of the Fortress, his white Armour added so much
to his Majesty, as his Charge was respected in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
Mass was said at an open Altar, that they might
begg Victory of the God of Hoasts; the Governour
and Major part of the Souldiers receiv'd the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Guardian of the <hi>Franciscans</hi> proclam'd
a Plenary indulgence to all those who Dy'd in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail;
when this was done, he commanded the pulling
down the gates of the Fortress, and the Dressing break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast

lately were arriv'd <hi>Alucaon</hi> and <hi>Mojatecaon</hi> with five

Lustily to their Oars, and being close to Shore
discharg'd all their Guns in the <hi>Moors</hi> quarters. The

The Governour at that time, with Scaling Ladders in

brought recommendatory Letters to <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi>

Offices with the Governour; to which they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
reply'd, that, only for that day they needed his

Plant,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 4. Cap. 1.</note> and Defend it, with their Lives. <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi>
seeing in such ordinary Souldiers such extraordinary

trusted 'em, with the Ladder, and his Honour; and as

a shot at randome took off their Heads.</p>

               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:57115:109"/>
which I should pass over were it not as Famous, as
Compassionate. <hi>Dom Iohn Manoel,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Falcaon,</hi>
Gentlemen of a great expectance, were for some
sleight Jealousies (which in the Worlds opinion are
heavy, as they are taken) fall'n out, and resolv'd to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
their Pique in the Field, making Valour or Chance
judge of their quarrel; The seconds, who engag'd with
less pre-occupy'd judgments, endeavour'd to decide the
quarrel by a more honourable Duel, alledging, the
Governour was ready to engage; that a Challenge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a Crime, would be now a Scandal; that by the
Edict they would forfeit their Lives; that <hi>Dom Iohn
de Castro,</hi> was not, though thought so, so indulgent a
Father, he bore with faults, but not with insolences;
that they might salve their Honours, where they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
their Lives, by agreeing, that he who first, and
with most Courage scal'd the Enemies Wall, should
have in the particular and common Fight, the clearest
Reputation; so by their Witty courage, inventing how
to Dye with Rewards, and how to Fight Duels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Crime, both the Enemies accepted the proposal,
desiring their Kindred, and Friends, to hold their Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
as to men who were to Fight for the States and
their own honour; at the same time both began to
climbe. <hi>Dom Iohn Manoel</hi> laying one hand on the Wall
had it cut off, relieving himself with the other, that too
by a stroak was ta'ne away, and putting his Elbows to't
to secure his hold, his Head was cut off by a Semitar.
<hi>Iohn Falcaon</hi> at the same instant seis'd on the Wall,
and having mastered it, while he stoutly defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was cut in pieces. The Braves in the Army were of
different opinions, who of these gave greatest marks of
their Courage; in favour of both, wee'l say, he who
gives all for it, owes no more to honour.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas</hi> began with his men to
plant Ladders,<note place="margin">How <hi>Dom Iohn Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carenhas</hi> behaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> many getting up with as much Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
as Fortune, for though receiv'd with Lances,
they o'recome the resistance; these had the honour
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57115:109"/>
to be the first in the Danger of being alone in the
Camp, sustaining the weight of the <hi>Moors</hi> till their
Companions came to 'em; how those who first scal'd
the Walls behav'd themselves, may be guest by their
posture of Fighting, the <hi>Moors</hi> fought on firm ground,
Ours suspended in the Air. <hi>Dom Alvaro de Castro,</hi> and
<hi>Dom Manoel de Lima,</hi> got over the Wall in several
places, receiving most hurt in the stoutest Resistance;
while they fought scattered, they lost some men, closing
they made more room for the getting up of their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>18. The Governour in the plain Field, met with
greater Danger,<note place="margin">The danger the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was in on the Bridge.</note> then there was in Scaling; for he
march't toward the Bridge, defended by a great Body

eminently hazarded himself in falling on, his Courage
was singular, his Fortune miraculous; for the <hi>Moors</hi>
often put their match to the prim'd Guns, and not one
took Fire, a success, by the Miracle opportune,<note place="margin">His mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</note> by the
Accident unusual, yet would not Heaven have the

some turn'd their backs to the Bullets, God perhaps,
by that, shewing us, what we are when left to our selves;
the Cowards fled, the Valiant stood to't; <hi>Dom Iohn de

with some who follow'd him clos'd with the Enemy,
crying aloud, Victory,<note place="margin">He crys out Victory,</note> the <hi>Turks</hi> run away: This noise
was spread with so happy Ecchos, as our men once more
Rally'd, and came to their Colours; the <hi>Turks</hi> fearfull,
or Credulous, left the Field, this shout of the Generals
being the gate of Victory. Our men did here the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Conquerours, and now that past for truth,

               <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> surrounded almost with the Enemies
whole Army, cry'd out Victory, and the <hi>Moors</hi> run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
without loss,<note place="margin">and pursues it.</note> but out of order: In fine, we had
by him before the Battail the Victory; Those who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
with the Governour unanimously affirm, that he
was the first got upon the Wall, and none but himself
contradicted this testimony, who freely said, <hi>Lourenco

               </note> slighting repute so weakly

            <p>19. <hi>Rumecaon,</hi> upon advice of his mens disorderly
Flight, came in with a Body of <hi>Turks,</hi> to stop, or interrupt
the Victory; and retarding the fury of our Souldiers
by the advantage of his Numbers, pois'd the Battail.
The obstinacy of the dispute lasted some time; The
Standard Royal was twice shot down, at which sight
the Governour impatiently cry'd out, what means this
<hi>Portuguese?</hi> shall they take out of your hands the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory?
shall they carry off the Standard?<note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour fights in Person.</note> and charging
the Enemy under cover of a Buckler which had stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it two Arrows, with words and actions so encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
the Souldiers, as with their fury, to make the
<hi>Moors</hi> give ground, and the last fly, by the fright of the
first.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>Dom Alvaro de Castro,</hi> and <hi>Dom Manoel de Lima</hi>
being joyn'd, rais'd the envy of their Souldiers and
Enemies; they charg'd <hi>Alucaon,</hi> and <hi>Mojatecaon,</hi> Valiant
<hi>Turks,</hi> and the Chief Commanders of the Army, who,
for no little time, made the Victory doubtfull; The
blood Dy'd the Arms, Dy'd the ground, the rude noise
of the <hi>Moors,</hi> did like a fresh danger fright the Camp,
the horrour and confusion so mastered the Senses, as
many before feeling their Wounds, felt themselves Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Number at last yielded to Courage, and the <hi>Turks</hi>
with infinite loss quitted their ground. <hi>Dom Iohn Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carenhas</hi>

loss; and as in extremities 'tis usual to accuse Fortune,
<hi>Rumecaon</hi> in the hearing of our men, with superstitious
Crys and Noises made his Atonements, as if so to appease
the indignation of the Heavens.</p>

Enemy; who resolutely expected him, and putting out
the Horns of the Half-moon in which he was form'd,
came begirting our Infantry; yet <hi>Dom Alvaro,</hi> as if he
would have to himself the glory of that Day, fell upon
the Enemy with so much Gallantry, as he was the first
of his men who Wounded the <hi>Moors,</hi> charging or

Here the Victory began to be notorious; but <hi>Rume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caon</hi>

On a suddain they all Rally'd, and recovering

            <p>24. The Governour fought still in the Camp, solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
for his mens Victory, secure in his own, when
News came to him, that the Town was delivered, but
<hi>Rumecaon</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rumecaon</hi> offers Battail again.</note> (like a Mine) plaid again, retarding the
Victory, with eight thousand Souldiers, so disposing
himself, as to give or expect Battail, so great were their
Numbers as with the leavings of the Field to manage
a new Warr. About that time Sally'd out of the City,
<hi>Dom Alvaro de Castro, Dom Iohn Mascarenhas,</hi> and <hi>Dom
Manoel de Lima,</hi> to joy with the Governour for the
Victory; when they saw <hi>Rumecaon</hi> in the Field with an
other Army. The Governour, that his suspence might
not be mistook for fear, with the same Courage of the
first, ingag'd in the second Battail, putting his men into
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57115:111"/>
three Squadrons, two fell upon the Enemy in the Flank,
he himself in the Front; this was the order of his
charging the Enemy,<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour defeats him.</note> who more Desperate then Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

then purchast.</p>
            <p>25. The <hi>Moors</hi> opened their Front, the Governour
(like an impetuous River carrying all before it) fell upon
them undefended; now was the Execution without

not by their Defence;<note place="margin">The Victory gotten.</note> and our men falling upon
some Companies not yet broken, they, as for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
Disordered themselves, flying from one another
with as much, rather more apparent Danger then from
us; others not to pass for Enemies threw away their
Arms, as Instruments which might mind us of their
Offence and our Vengeance; there were in fine, in that
Tragedy acted all those affections fear puts on. <hi>Rume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caon</hi>

but a Stone from an unknown hand, by his Death
sav'd his waiting on the Triumph. Many stood to be
the Authors of his Death, as formerly of <hi>Galba's,</hi> who
had more Murderers then Wounds; and in our own
Age and Kingdome have we seen the like accident.</p>
            <p>26. I purposely omit the particular accidents of this
Battail, because none can be prais'd without injury to
others, wee'l only give a short relation of the Officers,
and most eminent Personages, out of reverence to their
Place, and Quality; besides in the confusion of a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
'tis difficult with the exact Rigour of truth to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize
accidents; and 'tis certain, those whose Pen

to help out the History, or are very sharp
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57115:112"/>
sighted in finding out Events. 'Tis enough for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that so famous an Action credited then our Arms,
now our Memory, and I believe that of all the designs
in <hi>Asia</hi> no Siege out-went, or Battail equal'd this.</p>
            <p>27. The numbers of the Enemies Army cannot with
certainty be affirm'd,<note place="margin">Diverse opinions of the Enemies numbers.</note> because with different Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
some raise 'em above sixty thousand, others say
less, neither could the <hi>Moors</hi> who were ta'ne Prisoners,
make any exact judgment of those they lost; but by all
accounts, the disproportion of the Armies was so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
as was sufficient to amase the World with the
report; and in forein Histories we find the Victory
writ with more applause then in our own Memorials;
and if our Country imitated the <hi>Roman</hi> Empires grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
towards her Sons of desert, she would in proud
Statues let the World read <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi>'s actions,
which like Annals of Brass should be publick Volumes
to all Ages; we find not that his Reward was suitable
to his Merit,<note place="margin">Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating for his Victory.</note> perhaps to raise it, he here met
with the usual misfortune of <hi>Heroes,</hi> yet enjoy'd he as
a more durable recompence, the glory of his Name.
The Princes of <hi>Asia,</hi> by ambitious Embassies gave him
the joy of the Victory. The Chamber of <hi>Goa</hi> call'd
him Duke, either to mind him of it, or to seem to desire
it. The King <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> honour'd him with the Title of
Vice-King of <hi>India,</hi> the Fourth the State had there.
The same Earth which covers his Ashes, Buries his other
Rewards, his Posterity only Inheriting the glory of so
great an Ascendent.</p>
            <p>28. The Governour laid aside the King's share of the
Booty, many Colours, and forty Pieces of great Canon,
amongst which was that, we now have in Saint <hi>Gillians</hi>

taken. He delivered up the City to Plunder,<note place="margin">The plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Virtues,<note place="margin">Our assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from Heaven.</note> the Governour (as the <hi>Moors</hi> affirm) was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
assisted by some Divine power, for on the top
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57115:112"/>
of the Church they saw a Virgin, whose brightness
they were not able to behold,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 4. Cap. 1.</note> at whose sight their
hearts fail'd, on which they quitted their Arms, some
out of fear, others out of reverence. This favour from
Heaven is not above belief, if we consider the justice
of the Cause,<note place="margin">How many the <hi>Moors</hi> lost.</note> and piety of the General. There Dy'd of
the <hi>Moors</hi> five thousand, amongst them were <hi>Rumecaon,
Alucaon, Accedecaon,</hi> and other <hi>Turks</hi> of Name; the
Prisoners were six hundred, who afterwards honour'd
the Triumph;<note place="margin">Our dead and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> we lost of Ours thirty, the Wounded
were neer three hundred.</p>
            <p>29. The Governour had but few days rest in the
repose of Victory, being immediately seis'd on by the
Anxious care of Re-building, rather founding the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress
from the first Foundation; a Work, for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of it indispensable, for our Straights impossible,
for the expences of so long a Warr had drain'd the
States Revenues, so pawn'd besides, as only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
by a Peace of long continuance;<note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour Builds up the Fortress.</note> yet the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
not Disheartned by these difficulties, went
about beginning the new Fabrick, with a new design;
for in the judgment of the Skilfull, 'twas requisite to
enlarge the Situation, to make the Walls thicker, the
Bastions nearer, to Build <hi>Magazins</hi> in a dry place for the
keeping Ammunition, and Provision, that it might
be preserv'd well conditioned, which it had not been
formerly, but by the moistness of the Soil corrupted.
Materials could not be bought, or brought, without
pay, or wages; Stone-cutters, Pioneers and Work-men
ask't satisfaction for their Labour.</p>
            <p>The Governour had neither Plate, or Jewels to serve
his occasions, so as to be forc't to try other Pawns,
Valuable by his honour, not their own nature. He
commanded the Bones of his Son <hi>Dom Fernando</hi> to be
ta'ne up, to send 'em in an unheard of Pawn to the City
of <hi>Goa,</hi> but the Earth having not quite corrupted the
Body, he cut off some hairs of his own Beard,<note place="margin">Pawns for it the hairs of his Beard.</note> on which
he ask't twenty thousand <hi>Pardaos</hi> of the Chamber of

Commanders of the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and that you might
without any allay enjoy the pleasure and satisfaction of the
Victory, I spoke not in my Letter, of the great streights and
necessities I was in; but now I think fit, no longer to dissemble,
and to give you an account of the urgencies which are upon me,
and to desire your assistance to supply, and remedy things of
so great moment as are now in my hands; for the Fortress
of <hi>Dio</hi> is so beaten down to the ground, as not one foot of the
Wall can serve again, so as 'tis not only necessary this Summer
to Build it up again, but with such Skil, and in such a form
as the King of <hi>Cambaya</hi> may lose his hopes, of being at any
time able to take it. To this trouble is added an other as
great, or greater, to me incomparably above all others, which
is the trouble and perplexity the <hi>Lasquerins</hi> put me to for
their Pay, which I have secur'd to 'em, else would they be all
gone, and I should be left alone in the Fortress; which would
put me into no little danger, and consequently all <hi>India;</hi> for
the Commanders of the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> with those men
who are left of the Defeat, quarter at <hi>Suna,</hi> two Leagues
from this Fortress, and the King every day sends 'em Horse
and Foot to increase their Camp, as if they would return and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57115:113"/>
try their fortune by giving an other Battail, wherefore I am
in great want of a considerable sum of Money, and, because
it concerns the service of our Lord the King, and complies
with your Honour, and Loyalty, I earnestly begg of you to
remember your old Custom, and great Generosity, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
you (as good and Loyal Subjects) always to relieve
the urgent necessities of his Majesty, and for the great and
intimate affection I have for you all, you would lend me
twenty thousand <hi>Pardaos,</hi> which as a Gentleman I promise,
and on the Holy Gospel swear, before a years end to see you
Repaid, though I should be set upon, by greater necessities,
and extremities, then those by which I am at present envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron'd.
I commanded the taking up my Son <hi>Dom Fernando,</hi>
whom the <hi>Moors</hi> kill'd in this Fortress (fighting for God,
and our Lord the King) to pawn to you his Bones, but they
were found so, as 'twas not fit to take 'em out of the ground,
by which I am without any other Pawn, but part of my
Beard, which I hear send you by <hi>Diogo Rodriguez de Aze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedo,</hi>
for as you know, I have neither Gold, Plate, House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-stuff,

that you may more certainly rely on your Payment, and it
may not be thought by some, that (what hath at other times
fallen out) some intervening accident may keep you from
it; I here send you an order for the Treasurer of <hi>Goa</hi> to be

be made of it, till you are re-imburst; for the manner of the

what I have said before firmly perswaded, that you will in

of whom can we have any secure or firm Peace, though
some shew of a double and cousening Friendship. As for
the Loan, which in the name of our Lord the King you ask
of us, the Cities answer is, That we the Inhabitants will now
and always do our duty in serving his Majesty with our
Estates, Lives and Souls; and because the Cities, and
every particular man's design is to serve your Illustrious
Lordship with an Eye that such a Loan is very much for the
service of our Lord the King, whose the City is, and we are
all, with a great deal of diligence and care, from the day that
<hi>Diogo Rodriguez de Azevedo</hi> delivered his message, to
the present (which is the seven and twentieth of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>)
have we rais'd twenty thousand, one hundred and
forty six <hi>Pardaos,</hi> and one <hi>Tanga,</hi> at five <hi>Tangas</hi> the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dao,</hi>
which the City lends, that is Citizens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and People, as
also the <hi>Bramens,</hi> Merchants, Traders, and Goldsmiths; and
by our Letters we assure your Lordship, that this City, and
its honourable Inhabitants, are bound for your service to lay
down our Lives more chearfully then for our own honour and
interest. As for the Pawns your Lordship sent us, the City
and Inhabitants think our selves injur'd by your Lordship to
rely so little on us, and our Loyal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so concern'd the service of our Lord the King, and his Royal
State, such honourable and glorious Pawns were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
our Loyalty obliging us to serve the King, and
present necessity, after that your Obligations on us, and your

for which, and what besides we confess owing to you, we
kiss your hands, and begg of God Almighty your enjoying
perfect health, and prosperity, in much honour, and great
Victories over the Enemies of our most holy Faith. My
Lord, <hi>Diogo Rodriguez de Azevedo</hi> returns to carry you
back your Pawns, and he, and <hi>Bertholamew Bispo</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator
of this City bring you the Money, which the City,
and People lend you, of their good and free will; they carry
too, the order you sent hither to the Treasurer for the payment
of the Money; and our desires, you would accept all, as from
Loyal Subjects, we profess to be to our Lord the King, and
men oblig'd to your Lordship.</p>

satisfaction to the Officers,<note place="margin">The work go on at the Fortress.</note> and Labourers, as it advanc't
without time, and the pay of Work-men and Souldiers
was so punctual, as the State was only poor; for the
Governour, besides what the City lent, the Ladies, and
Gentlewomen, sent him in a Cabinet their Diamonds,
and Jewels, by which Female impotency sacrifis'd both
to Glory and Vanity; an offer which expected neither
interest, or recompence; whence is seen, how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <hi>Dom Manoel de Lima</hi> wageth it.</note> (who again look't for good fortune in that

to be forc't by the necessity of the Storm,<note place="margin">Goes to the City of <hi>Goga.</hi>
               </note> to put into

There was at Anchor in the Port a <hi>Moorish</hi> Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
belonging to the <hi>Qamalake,</hi> (one who was in good
correspondence with the State) which observing the
flight of the <hi>Moors</hi> hal'd to our men to fall upon the
City. <hi>Dom Manoel</hi> not understanding the sign, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that in defiance they bid him Battail, and 'twixt
anger and impatience making ready, perceiv'd the City
emptying, and the poor people running in confus'd
multitudes towards a small Mountain, which was in
sight, believing the distance, and cragginess of its situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would secure 'em from being fall'n upon by our
Souldiers; <hi>Dom Manoel</hi> found out the design of the
Ships hawling, and put to't, 'twixt the opportunity, and
his obedience, brought the business to Council; and
amongst Valiant Souldiers, Gallantry being the best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of Orders, 'twas voted they should enter the
City, because the Governours instructions could not
take in all accidents, who, if there, would be the first
should leap on shore; the Counsel was immediately
follow'd by Execution; <hi>Dom Manoel,</hi> almost without
any resistance entred the City; the pillage of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
was great, and what was below the coveting, was
committed to the Fire, which burnt Estates and Houses;
the Dammage was greater then the Victory.<note place="margin">Which he Sacks and Burns.</note> 
               <hi>Dom
Manoel</hi> took three <hi>Baneans</hi> Prisoners, by whom he was
told, that all the Inhabitants had sav'd themselves in a
place of the Mountain not farr of; he resolv'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
it, that the fugitives and opposers might have the
same Punishment; at break of Day he went to the
place, taking with him for guides the <hi>Baneans,</hi> forc't by
miserable necessity to deliver up their Children and
Kindred; and those who thought themselves secure in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57115:116"/>
the shelter of the Mountain, saw over their Heads the
Sword, before the Enemy. The slaughter differenc't
not cause from cause, person from person, natives and
strangers, guilty and innocent with their Lives paid for
their own or an others offence. From Persons the
affront past to Religion, he caus'd many to be Hang'd
up in the Temples of their Idols, an outrage in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
of their Religion, inexpiable. He cut the
Throats of all the Cattel, sprinkling the Mosques with
Cows blood, an Animal, which as the depositary of
Souls, they adore with adominable worship.</p>

ventur'd to cross the Bay, where without a Storm he
fear'd Shipwrack; for the Tide is there so unruly, and
impetuous, as is sufficient to loosen the Vessels. In

               </note> where he found

either wore out, or satisfy'd with the difficulties of the

would accept it after him; for by the late Victory and

put the Governour upon finding out a Commander for
the Garrison, which some Gentlemen had refus'd to be,
out of Dislike to a place which had been the Seat of so

Persons of extraordinary Eminency;<note place="margin">

Manoel de Lima</hi> offer'd to remain on the place, out of
either complacency to the Governour, or confidence of
himself.</p>
            <p>35. The Governour in the mean time provided for
his passage to <hi>Goa,</hi> and ordered <hi>Antonio Moniz Barretto</hi>

            <p>40. The Governour suffer'd himself to be o'recome

sleight the honours of a Triumph, without injuring
those who bore him Company in the atchievement,
nor limit the popular Rejoycing, without envying the
common prosperity; their festival Solemnities having
their excuse in our Fortune, their example in the <hi>Caesars.</hi>
The fifteenth of <hi>April</hi> of the Year 1547. was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the day of the Triumph, the first, and last,
our Arms ever saw, us'd to purchase Fame without
glory. The City Built in Saint <hi>Catherines Basar,</hi> a great
Arch, covering the Materials with diverse Carpets. The
gate of the City was from the top of the Wall thrown
down,<note place="margin">The Fabrick of it.</note> the Stones appearing humble, or gratefull; the
Hangings of the Walls were of Rich cloth of Gold,
greatness could do no more, the general satisfaction was
not content with less. In many places the Adornment
was of diverse Colour'd Velvets, that the Gold might
set off the Majesty, the diversity of Colours the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness.
On the Walls on each side the Gate were
two gilded Lyons, upholding in their Paws the wheels
of the <hi>Castros,</hi>
               <note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 4. Cap. 6.</note> always Famous, now Triumphant.
There run along by the Arch a dilated Thicket of Trees,
which with intermitting shades, qualify'd the heat,
without hindring the light. The Sea appear'd all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Ships, Galleys, Boats, and Brigantines, which
came from the Nighbouring Islands, all with their
Streamers and Wast-cloaths. There was in the Court
of the Palace a Fortress, design'd for the Model of <hi>Dio,</hi>
within it some Guns charg'd without Bullets, and other
Fire-arms, a pleasant Representation of former Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
In the same Fortress was hid exquisite Musick,
which with Tunables voices kept time in singing the
praises of the Governour, delighting by their sweetness,

the Ear, by their words, the Judgment. The general
correspondency in the adorning the Streets, was as if
design'd to shew the Riches of the <hi>East;</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery,
as common, was look't upon with scorn. The
Cloaths of the Citizens were in all kinds such, as if the
People had Triumph'd; Neither, if their hearts could
have been seen, would the applause of their souls have
seem'd less, being the voluntary Demonstrations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificial
affections.</p>
            <p>41. The Governour came from <hi>Pangim</hi> in a little
Gally,<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours entry.</note> differenc't from the rest by its Adorning; he had
with him the old Cavalliers, his Companions in the
Expedition, who shar'd equally of the glory and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
The Galleons of the Fleet went on Head, in
their Stern follow'd the Vessels with Oars, with their
Sails furl'd in the Brayles, and all shadow'd with the
Verdure of several Boughs, appearing from the Land, a
loose Wood, or moving City. When they came in sight
of the Fortress, by the horrour of their Salute, the
Warr seem'd rather real then apparent; the Guns also
from the Shore, gave 'em so terrible an answer, as the
senses could not distinguish whether it were a Fight or
Triumph; all the Fleet opened to make way for the
Governours Gally. He was richly Cloath'd, giving the
Season its due, and became them as well, and sprightly as
his Arms; He had on, a French suit of Crimson Satin,
with Gold twist about the Slashes and Seams, and not
to forget he was a Souldier, he put on a Coat of Mail
wrought on Cloth of Gold with Buttons of Plate,
Feathers in his Hat, and the Guarniture of his Sword
Gold. Upon the Key, the Officers of the Militia,
Nobility, and Magistracy of the City waited for him,
with whom he entred the first Gate, where one of the
Consuls made him a sober Speech in Latin, shewing,
that by the advantage of his Valour we had humbled
the proudest Scepter of the <hi>East,</hi> whose Ruins would
be his Fames best Trumpets; that <hi>Portugal</hi> had now
secur'd the State, born again in his Arms, who fought as

inviting our Forces to make Peace, or
forward the Victory; the <hi>East</hi> also saw him often girt
his Sword for the cause of Religion.</p>
            <p>1. King <hi>Iohn</hi> had sent to the Island of <hi>Zeilan</hi> some
<hi>Franciscan</hi> Friars,<note place="margin">

ambition of Empire. These Friars on their Landing in
the Island were by the King of <hi>Cotta</hi> civilly entertain'd,
the Sun of Righteousness beginning once more to rise
in the <hi>East.</hi> That <hi>Paganism</hi> began to Listen to the
Voice of Heaven, and that Barren ground to answer
the pains by its Improvement, by the coming in of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Sheep to the Sheep-fold of the Church.</p>
            <p>2. Those Embassadours of the Gospel went forward,
to give News of the Light to the King of <hi>Candea,</hi>

the heart of the Island, whom they found Courteous
in the entertainment of their Persons, flexible to the
obedience of their Doctrine; He was instructed in the
mysteries of our Belief, that with a stronger Faith he
might wash in the waters of Baptism. He gave the
Friars ground, Materials, and Money, for the Building a
Church; that being the first Fortress the Conquest of
the Gospel rais'd in the Island against the delusions of
Idolatry; for of the Preaching of the Apostle Saint
<hi>Thomas</hi> (if it reach't so farr) neither had their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
any light, nor their Country memory.</p>
            <p>3. That Prince shew'd himself obedient to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of our Religion,<note place="margin">He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant.</note> but not constant, for the fear
of his Subjects revolting on his change of Doctrine,
made him, not to lose what he Esteem'd, forsake what
he was Convicted of; for as a Plant not yet Rooted,
the force of human perswasion enclin'd him either way.
The Religious men endeavour'd to take those Rubbs
out of the way of Life,<note place="margin">He Friars encourage him.</note> by assuring him that under the
protection of our Religion, and Arms, he might secure
both Crowns, for the State was at that time Govern'd
by <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro,</hi> who for the propagation of the
Faith us'd to venture his Blood, for his Friends, the
State.</p>
            <p>4. The King listned to the proposition, saying, if
the Governour would send him Relief,<note place="margin">His reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</note> he would not
only himself profess the Faith, but preach it to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
One of the Friars carry'd this resolution to <hi>Goa;</hi>

               </note> certify'd of the cause of his coming,
desir'd the Conversion of that Prince, as his greatest
business in the <hi>East,</hi> not less zealous in giving Children
to the Church, then Victories to the State.
He immediately dispatch't <hi>Antonio Moniz Barretto</hi>
with seven Fly-boats, and Orders, that if he found
any of our Ships at Sea to carry 'em with him; writ
honourable Letters to the Prince, which he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with several Presents: but leaving <hi>Antonio

            <p>5. The Governour had dispatch't from <hi>Dio, Dom
Iorge de Menezes,</hi> to commit all imaginable Hostilities
in the Bay of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> to show the <hi>Sultan</hi> the edge of
our Arms was not Blunted, by their former Execution.
<hi>Dom Iorge</hi> took some Vessels of Provision going to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the Enemies Ports, that those the Sword had
spar'd, might be made an end of by Famine. He came
one Evening in sight of the City <hi>Baroche,</hi> whose state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Buildings presented him with the Politeness of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
'Twas situated on an Eminency surrounded with
Brick-walls,<note place="margin">The Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Fortifying of <hi>Baroche.</hi>
               </note> which were more for shew, then defence;
yet were there diverse Bull-works to be seen, made not
without some in-sight in Fortification, furnish't with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
of Ordnance, which commanded the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Haven. The height of the situation discovered
the Gates to be of square Stone polish't, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
of Turrets and Windows, argued the
wealth and policy of the Inhabitants. The Trade of
the place was in very fine Silks, a Commodity expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thence to many Ports of the <hi>East. Madre Maluco</hi>
was Lord of the City,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Madre Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luco</hi> Lord of it.</note> and had Tributary the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Villages, which, by their fertility and bigness,
made him up a moderate Seignory.</p>
            <p>6. Our men had by chance taken a little Boat of
Fisher-men, Natives of the place, who upon enquiry
told what we have related of the City, and upon <hi>Dom
Iorge</hi>'s desire to know what Garrison was in the place,
had said, that <hi>Madre Maluco</hi> had carry'd all the Souldiery
to <hi>Amadabat,</hi> the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Court, and at present were
remaining only some Artisans, and other Trades-men.
<hi>Dom Iorge</hi> thinking the occasion opportune for assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the City, though his strength was not proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to such a design, yet (events depending on acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents)
resolv'd to run his Fortune; and to amuse the
Inhabitants in security, steer'd an other course, Sailing
by a different <hi>Rumbe,</hi> taking along with him the Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57115:121"/>
to be his Pilots in the entrance. At night the
whole Fleet tacking about,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dom Iorge</hi> enters by Night.</note> stood up with the Port, and
getting all on Shore, (the Enemies confidence, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
being unprovided of any Defence, or Sentinel)
fell upon the Unarm'd, and weak Multitude, when the
Night, Confusion, and Sleep, run 'em upon the danger
they avoided, miserably wandering, they shun'd their
own as Enemies, flying from those who fled themselves.
The skreeks of the Children stirr'd not up in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
any Compassion, less Vengeance, for the suddain
fear gave 'em over to the basest affections of Nature;
the Crys and Laments of the Women discovered them,
their, Ah me, being their greatest danger; those who by
flying into Houses scap't the Sword, were in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
by the Fire, the poor people having no remedy
against, but choice of their Death; the Invasion, and
Sack was at the same time; the Slaughter, as in a Fight
without resistance; the Plunder, as in a City forc't to
deliver. <hi>Dom Iorge</hi> in fine purchas'd in this Action,
Fame without Danger, Victory without an Enemy;
yet doubt we not that had he found more Opposition,
his Courage would have atchiev'd what his Fortune
effected. He commanded the City to be Burnt, where,
in a few hours, the Nobility and People, Gardens and
Houses became compassionate Ashes, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of nature, or separation of place. He put on
Board some of the smaller Guns, broke in pieces the
great. This Action being so famous amongst our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
as to give him who was call'd <hi>Menezes,</hi> the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
of <hi>Baroche,</hi> as the Ruins of <hi>Carthage</hi> gave <hi>Scipio</hi>
the name of <hi>Africanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>Maluco</hi> came with five thousand Horse; soon
enough to deplore, too late to help,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maluco</hi> comes too late.</note> and seeing the
Fire and Sword had left nothing in its own shape, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
impatiently to the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> as one
whose green Wound very sensibly smarted. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to him the Destruction of the City, as an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
aggravated by being the latest of so many; The
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57115:122"/>
               <hi>Sultan</hi> seem'd touch't with this new accident, and

in an imaginary Revenge, we will speak of the
Spirituals of <hi>Candea,</hi> which as Seed choak't up by Thorns
came not to produce any Fruit.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Madune</hi> King of <hi>Cotta</hi> came to know that the King
of <hi>Candea</hi> endeavour'd by the change of his Religion
to get the protection of the State, (who as those <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>

be the most Insolent man upon Earth, who

but that, he Obey'd, and Ador'd; that he deny'd not
the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Religion, to be either better, or more
fortunate, since they serv'd the God of Victories; yet
'twas sufficient for him to serve the Gods of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
he was Born in, without coveting a better Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or greater Fortune then his Predecessors; besides,
who knew that the Governour under pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
design'd not the usurpation of his Scepter; that
he ought not to receive on the Island, men of such a
temper as could not be satisfy'd, without being the
Lords, to be any where; that if the <hi>Franks</hi> promis'd
him, to furnish him with a better Creed, and inlarge his
Territories, what sound judgment would credit so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
goodness in men he never saw, especially when
they were not so great despisers of Temporalities, but
to come from the end of the World to Domineer in
<hi>Asia?</hi> that if example had with him any Authority, he
should find more Kingdomes destroy'd by 'em, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrinated;
that 'twas true, their <hi>Ioques</hi> (by them
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57115:122"/>
call'd Priests) did willingly Dye for their Religion'
but did it, either out of an ambition of Name, or prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
of Life; if there were not in the <hi>West</hi> more Fools,
then in other Parts, who were all possest with that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
obstinacy of instructing the World; that in fine,
he Counsel'd him as a King and Ally to cut off the
Relief he expected from the <hi>Franks,</hi> in expiation to his
old Gods, justly incenst to be thrown off for a forein
Divinity; that were it their Pride in pretending to
come and enlighten his Understanding, or ambition to
usurp his Kingdome, the Circumstance of either fault
deserv'd this Punishment; that in prosecution of it he
would assist him with Arms, and Souldiers, making that
a common Cause, which was the Outrage of all their
Idols.</p>
            <p>9 The unfortunate Prince not able at once to throw
off the weight of his old Errors,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Candea</hi> consents.</note> suffered himself to be
perswaded by the Arguments of his Barbarous, and
Treacherous friend; his Eyes yet darkned with the
Clouds of Idolatry, not being able to endure the Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

prudence or resolution, conspir'd in <hi>Madune</hi>'s Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,

In fine, they expected their Guests, resolv'd to put

which he took one hundred and twenty select Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and with them march't, in the security that he was
going to a Prince, a Friend, and one obliged by the State,
above all, if not yet a Convert, at least gratefull, and

Moniz</hi> had not notice of it by diverse advices, and by
their pretending to divide his Souldiers, so to Kill 'em
more securely; besides, the King in Person would not
see 'em, perhaps, not to discover by his Affections, his
Timerous, and guilty Conscience. <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi>
march't presently out of the City, Commanded all the
Impediments and Baggage to be Burnt, to be thus
more at liberty, to Defend and Retreat, and assembling
his Souldiers spoke to 'em;</p>
            <p>11. <q>Friends and Companions, you all know the
Treason plotted against us by this <hi>Pagan</hi> King, whom
we come to serve and assist;<note place="margin">He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to resist.</note> I have intelligence they
will set upon us by open Force, having now a reason,
or cause to hurt us, they had not before, that is, that
we have found out their Treachery. None of us hath
any more Life, then he can Defend; Courage, and
Discipline may save us; we expect no Relief, for it lies
in our selves; and the Infidels will not persist in their
Treason, if they find it Costly; and what is it? if in
this Conjuncture we do that for our selves, we came
to do for them, that is, lose our Lives. The passages
which go to <hi>Baticalou,</hi> where our Fleet is, must be
suppos'd Lin'd with the Enemy, wherefore I am of
opinion, for us to go to the King of <hi>Ceitavaca,</hi> a
faithfull Friend to the State, where we shall find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
and secure protection to go from thence
in quest of our Fleet.</q>
            </p>
            <p>12. As soon as <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi> began to march, the
Enemy appear'd in Companies,<note place="margin">Is set upon by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> charging us with Arrows,
Darts, Stones, and other such Weapons, with which
they Wounded some of our men, and made account
by this importune way of Fighting to Destroy us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger. The Enemy appear'd to have a Body of
eight thousand men, Commanded by their Officers
(by them call'd <hi>Modeliares</hi>) expert in that wild way
of charging and retiring, out-going us in number and
agility, and without doubt would one by one have
Destroy'd us, had not our Musquets made 'em stand off,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57115:123"/>
from which they receiv'd no little Dammage, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fear, for scar'd, by seeing some drop down Dead
suddainly, the rest follow'd us with more fear and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
they thus continued Gawling us all that day,
one while Venturous, another Cowards; with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
and troublesome chase, they gave us a flow, but
un-interrupted charge.</p>
            <p>13. By the coming on of the Night our men had
more security, then repose,<note place="margin">The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty he was in.</note> for they were so disquieted
with wandring and roving Shot, that the poor Souldiers
could not take any little rest upon their Arms, eating
their Biscuit with their Eyes toward the Enemy, and
their Hands on their Weapons; so past they till the
next day, when they discovered the <hi>Pagans,</hi> more Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous
and Daring, for that first horrour our Fire-arms
bred in 'em, was either quite lost or moderated. They
at last arriv'd to the confidence to charge us with short
Arms, on which <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi> was forc't to stop his
March, and sometimes front 'em, in this we cut off some
of their men, and took Prisoner, amongst the rest one
of their <hi>Modeliars,</hi> who by his Habit and Arms seem'd
to Command the party, as also, by their venturing and
daring to recover him, making several Charges, in
which they were worsted, yet so constant in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
attaquing us, as our men quite worn out could no
longer maintain it.</p>
            <p>14. Some were of opinion to face the Enemy,<note place="margin">His pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in moderating his men.</note> and
either by Fighting free themselves, or Dye reveng'd;
but <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi> told 'em, that the greatest proof of
their Courage would be enduring, and the only way to
save 'em; that they had already Conquer'd the greatest
part of the way; that Marching with care and in a
Body, they could not receive much Dammage; that
the greater the danger was, more would the pleasure be,
when they should tell it gloriously, and securely. Thus
did the Commander encourage 'em, and Bridle the
despair of so tedious a Resistance, till the coming of the
Night made 'em some amends for the Days difficulty;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57115:124"/>
for the <hi>Pagans</hi> being also broken, gave our men some
time to rest; yet at break of Day did they assault us
more furiously, asham'd perhaps to find amongst so few
so stout opposition. They now came on more boldly
on our men, who defended themselves, though with less
strength, with their usual Courage.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi> commanded one to break the
<hi>Modeliars</hi> Leggs he had taken Prisoner, and cast him in
the way, whom his own men, leaving off Fighting, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
went to Relieve, mov'd by their affection or
pity, to see their Leader or Companion, in so compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
a condition; Our men, were for some time as if
without an Enemy, yet suddainly Fir'd with Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seration,

a narrow passage, which ended in a Bridge made over a
great River not to be Foarded; here <hi>Antonio Moniz</hi>
shew'd extraordinary Courage, facing the Enemy with

night encreas'd the danger, many flying from their own
shadows; the Crys of the fearfull only reach't the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress,
for they were surpris'd with fear without danger.
The Commander in chief sent out <hi>Dom Francisco d' Esa</hi>
with some Souldiers, who going into the Colony of the
<hi>Chelins,</hi> saw in every ones fear and confusion the face of
a Warr without an Enemy, who was by this time on
Board, carrying with him only the imaginary vanity of
having Landed; <hi>Simaon de Mello</hi> was as sensible of the
King of <hi>Achem</hi>'s Cowardise, as if it had been an Outrage;
so sacred were the Walls of that Fortress, as if to
march towards 'em had been an Insolence, to look on
them a Crime; He presently set forth a light Vessel, to
find out the King of <hi>Achem</hi>'s course, whilst he put
to Sea two great Carvels, and six Fly-boats to find out
the Enemy. <hi>Diogo Soarez de Mello</hi> with the two Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys

that if by the Governours orders they were limited to

the Enemy was in Port eight Leagues off, <hi>Dom Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco</hi>
resolv'd, having him so near, to persue; here was
the Souldiers murmuring greater then before, though
less insolent, seeing the hazard of their fear out-go

the Enemy was at an Anchor, in a Bay form'd by the

River, and with Boughs laid out the Chanel, to avoid
the Shelves, and knowing by the soundings there was
water enough for the Carvels, lay in, as the Enemy with
two Galleys, and other Ships, was coming to find out
our Fleet; for he was told by his Spies, who from the
Shore had only seen the great Carvels, (the Fly-boats,
and Galleys being covered by the shelter of a crooked
winding Point made there by the River) there were
none but Merchant men. The Enemy had sent before
two Galleys, which were Convoys to a Fleet of Fly-boats,
and finding those Souldiers they imagin'd Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
strove to tack about, but the River being nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,

that as Friends to the State, they desir'd leave to Land

            <p>31. <hi>Martim Affonso de Sousa,</hi> (as we have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
left things, betwixt <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> and the State,
dispos'd for an open Enmity, in which <hi>Dom Iohn de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro</hi>
could not refuse satisfaction without a Warr, or give
it, with his reputation. Upon the <hi>Moors</hi> retiring, the
Territories of <hi>Bardez</hi> and <hi>Salsete</hi> were under our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and the fruits of Husbandry grew under the
protection of our Arms. <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> seeing the Land

                  <hi>Hidalcaon</hi>'s perplexity.</note> and that likewise the Injury was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in a Retention, by him counted unjust, did every
day by Arms mind us of his Title; alarm'd also by

Inroads, more provok't then weakned the State,
and that by keeping from us Provisions, he impoverish't
his Subjects, and inrich't his Neighbours, from whose
Ports we were furnish't; He consulted how to set upon
us in open Warr, in which he would venture his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Person, leaving the fortune of a Battail to
decide the justice of his or our Arms; and being grown
Rich by Peace and Tyranny, the expence of that Warr
he was to make at his own Doors,<note place="margin">He sends Forces on the main Land.</note> was easie. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
sent eight thousand Souldiers to get possession
of the Land in dispute, whilst more Forces were raising
to maintain what they recovered.</p>
            <p>32. The Governour on the first advice of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road
sent <hi>Dom Diogo de Almeyda Freire</hi> with nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Portuguese,</hi> some paid <hi>Canarins</hi> and a Troop of

to come with the rest of the Forces to his Relief,
if <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> came in Person, a report cast out by the

with the Enemy, who would not engage, or accept
the Battail we offer'd, knowing perhaps we could not
endure a long Warr for want of Provisions, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of the ground, which was Marish and out into

of our Cavallry in all places of the <hi>Campannia,</hi> in some

Conquer'd by the <hi>Moors,</hi> who being Natives of the

            <p>33. The Governour return'd from <hi>Pangim</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi>
where he put to Council the State of things,<note place="margin">and debaits the Warr in Council.</note> and his
desires of quelling <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> with a sharper Warr to
avoid the troublesomeness of so repeated Inroads, so
to have his hands at Liberty to attend other business,
which he could not do, leaving so importune a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

diferr the Warr till a fitter opportunity, which would
be the next Summer, when our men might Encamp on

Souldiers from the Kingdome, expected by the next
Ships; the design of Action not being haste, but Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
            <p>34. The Governour though warlick,<note place="margin">'Tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd till an other time.</note> and impatient,
subjected his will to his understanding, expecting a time
to call <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> to a more severe account for his insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
which being agreed on, he ordered <hi>Dom Diogo

through the Street call'd our Lady of Light, he saw in

were dispos'd so much pleas'd him, as stopping his Horse,

he ask't who Liv'd there; the Master himself hapned
to answer him, who was <hi>Francisco Goncalvez,</hi> a Souldier

curiosity, and well employing his time, commanded
thirty <hi>Pardaos</hi> to be given him to cleanse his Arms,
though in his Government there was but little time for
Arms to gather Rust.</p>

that his Peace with the State, was that on which depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

            <p>36. The Governour assembled the Magistracy of the

38. The Governour had three thousand <hi>Portuguese</hi>

with this resolution, who all agreed in the seasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

caution, immediately went about, though <hi>Dom Iorge</hi>
hal'd 'em to stay. Here was the greatest danger where
none was apprehended; for from a Colony of the
<hi>Abessines,</hi> which lies upon the River, came repeated
Shot, which <hi>Dom Iorge</hi> observing went on Shore, and
entring the Village, gain'd the Guns of the Redouts
with so great courage and presence of mind, as to carry
'em on Board, maugre the resistance of those who came
to the rescue; this security heightned the opinion of our
strength, the Enemy perhaps measuring our force by
our daring.</p>
            <p>46. <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> having sent <hi>Dom Iorge</hi> before with
the Fly-boats,<note place="margin">and two other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</note> sent after him two more, Commanded
by <hi>Francisco da Sylva de Menezes,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Fernandez de

Shore, came to Anchor at a Road a little short of the
Colony of the <hi>Abessines;</hi> whence they sent off some
Mariners to water, who getting on Shore walk't about a
Canon-shot. <hi>Caracem,</hi> at the report of the Guns,
(which as we now said were Shot from the <hi>Abessines</hi>
Colony) sent five hundred <hi>Turks</hi> to their Relief, who
found the Posts lost, and the Guns on Board, and
Marching on were discovered by the Mariners who
were getting water, and gave the Alarm to <hi>Francisco da
Sylva</hi> that the Enemy appear'd, <hi>Francisco da Sylva,</hi>
seconded by <hi>Iohn Fernandez de Vasconcellos,</hi> went to
their Relief, and forming a close Body, invested the

            <p>47. Our men got on Board,<note place="margin">They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Dom Alvaro.</hi>
               </note> and in Company of <hi>Dom

and observations to <hi>Dom Alvaro,</hi> 'twas thought by the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57115:133"/>
Officers, the atchievement was not seasonable, the
Fleet being discovered, and the Coast alarm'd; only
<hi>Dom Iorge</hi> obstinately insisted, that they ought to fall
upon the Fortress, his height of mind being the best
argument; but the contrary opinion was so strongly
urg'd, that the most happy success could not have been
faultless.</p>
            <p>48. While <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> was in the River of <hi>Surat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What the Governour did at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caim.</hi>
               </note>
the Governour at <hi>Bacaim</hi> dispatch't diverse affairs, and
being Facetious as well as Valiant, gave out He was
going to surprise the <hi>Sultan</hi> in <hi>Amadabat,</hi> where in sight
of the <hi>Turks</hi> who guarded him he would roast him Alive,
and this report being, by so great Victories,<note place="margin">History of <hi>India,</hi> Dec. 6. Lib. 5. Cap. 7.</note> credited,
'twas current amongst these timerous and credulous
<hi>Moors.</hi> The Governour to advance their fear or his own
gallantry, bespoke some great Spits, as one who in the
interval of more weighty business delighted in Witty
diversion. The Souldiers of those times us'd to wear at
their Girdles little bright Axes, which serv'd to cut the
Rigging and Tackling of their Prizes, as also to break
open Chests and Bundels, this was the true use, the first
a pretence. The Governour not liking Arms design'd
for so mean service, and seeing by chance <hi>Fausto Serraon
de Calvos</hi> a spruce Souldier, pass by with an Ax, told
him, that only a Sword became men of honour; Sir,
answer'd the Souldier, without this Ax your honours
Spits will be of little use, because we shall not be able
to Roast the King of <hi>Cambaya</hi> whole.</p>
            <p>49. The Governour went to joyn his Son at the
Barr of <hi>Surat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to joyn his Son.</note> where he had intelligence the Fortress
was Reliev'd; from thence with all his Fleet together
he went to <hi>Baroche,</hi> from that Port dispatch't <hi>Francisco
de Sequeins</hi> (Commander of the <hi>Naires</hi> of <hi>Cochim</hi>) to
sound the River, and see what was to be done, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself by his sight of the conditions of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress.
This Captain went up the River till he came in
sight of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Army, which or'e-spread a very
large Plain; the report was, he had brought into the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57115:134"/>
Field two hundred thousand Souldiers; the truth is,
the multitudes were so great as to cover that and the
adjacent <hi>Campagnia.</hi> He reported what he had seen
to the Governour, who heightned to see himself so
fear'd, would for the credit of his own Fame face the
Enemy; He gave orders for the weighing of the Fleet,
and Sail'd up, till he cast Anchor in sight of an Army
whose numbers drunk up Rivers; and going on Shore,
laid out his ground and presented Battail to the <hi>Sultan.</hi>
So stout an Action, as amongst the most memorable of
the World ought not to be the second. The <hi>Sultan,</hi>
neither accepted or deny'd Fighting, but expected to be
fall'n on as well as found out; he saw the Governour,
but would not see his Sword. <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro,</hi>
hunting after new glory in extraordinary Actions, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Officers and Gentlemen of name, to whom he
spoke to this purpose.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Makes a Speech to his men.</note>
and greatest Army, Fortune is seeking out occasions
to make us glorious, that after this Victory, we may
lay up our Arms in the obedience of the <hi>East.</hi> I allow
the great inequality betwixt the Armies, but we
count not our Troops by number, but gallantry.
Those are the same we so lately beat at <hi>Dio,</hi> we need
not give 'em new Wounds, only make the Incision
greater of those which are yet open; their numbers
heighten their fear, seeing all ways of saving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Obstructed: if but yesterday when they held
us Besieg'd they left us the Field, how will they stand
in our way when Victorious? They who have lost
their own honour, are but ill maintainers of their
Kings; our strength is greater then the Enemies, on
our side fight Fame and Victory; I believe there's
none here, who would part with his share of this days
glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>51. The Gentlemen and Souldiers disswaded the
Governour from so hazardous an attempt,<note place="margin">The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens and Officers answer.</note> for in so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable
Forces the very Victory was blame-worthy;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57115:134"/>
that great men trusted more to Reason then
Fortune; that he should look to his preservation ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an over-plus of Fame; that 'twas enough to have
Landed, and on his own ground bid the <hi>Sultan</hi> Battail.
The Governour suffered himself to be overcome by
those Reasons, more apprehending the fault, then dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
<hi>Dom Iorge</hi> desir'd five hundred Musquetteers with
them to Skirmish with the Enemy; but as they had put
by <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi>'s full Blow for the Battail, he
seem'd unwilling to give the <hi>Sultan</hi> so sleight a Wound;
He staid three hours in the Field without the Enemies
moving,<note place="margin">He stays three hours in the Field, and goes on Board.</note> then re-imbark't his Souldiers, so unscar'd and
full of security as if in one of the States Ports; the
most glorious Action we ever perform'd without

            <p>52. The Governour from <hi>Baroche</hi> crost over to <hi>Dio,</hi>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57115:135"/>
laid to his charge by his Enemies, which as a Friend he
was willing to forget, could not as a Magistrate; that
he might by new Services silence all former miscarriages,
remaining in that Fortress, which had so on it the Eyes

accepted it,<note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour gives it to <hi>Lewis Falcaon.</hi>

<hi>Dom Iohn de Castro,</hi> with signal favours, commended,

the Booty was given up to the Fire, the Prize not being

them, had he not been hindered by the disswasions of
his Officers; which <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi> took so to
heart, as if 'twere necessary to divine opportunities, and
his temper burst forth into words, which accus'd the
Commanders of the Fleet of neglect and remisness.</p>
            <p>56. The Governour employ'd the short Leisure he
had at <hi>Bacaim</hi> in writing for the Kingdome,<note place="margin">puts the King in mind of those who had serv'd him.</note> making so

these standing for the preservation of the City,
the other on the reputation of our Armies; the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
was at last decided and compos'd, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
being so near, should be acquainted with the
business, who understanding the Civil Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled
in ordering the Warr, chid sharply their
animosity, allow'd and confirm'd <hi>Diogo de Almeyda</hi>'s
resolution of finding out the Enemy, sending him orders
to stay with his men at <hi>Pangim,</hi> where he would in few

much Deliberation, the Governour resolv'd on

                  <hi>Dom Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varo</hi> gets on Shore.</note> he being one of the
first, who amongst many repeated Shot got footing;
here was the Enemies resistance in hindering, or retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our passage; the Battail was for some time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
inclining, the place and cause heightning their Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
in Fighting; the Crys of Women and Children
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57115:136"/>
in their Ears, made them receive Wounds without
pain or fear; the Dead who fell were not an example
for their Fear but Vengeance. The Blood ran down on
both sides, and the resoluteness of both parties made
the success Contingent, when the Governour with the
rest of his men came in,<note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him, and takes the City.</note> and charg'd the Enemy so
home, as he began to abate in his Defence; they were
by degrees giving ground, till by a declar'd flying they
left us the Victory. The Governour mingled with the
<hi>Moors</hi> entred the City, where many Dy'd in sight of
their Wives they could neither forsake nor defend.
The slaughter was succeeded by Covetousness, the
Booty was not inferiour to the Victory; the Vessels of
the Fleet could scarce take in the pillage. The City in
a few hours was Consum'd by a Lamentable fire, its
deplorable Ruins once more preserving the memory of
this and a former Destruction. We lost in this Action
five Souldiers, the Enemy two hundred, the number of
the Wounded was greater.</p>
            <p>62. The Governour leaving the City in Flames re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbark'd,
and steer'd for <hi>Agacaim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arrives at <hi>Agacaim.</hi>
               </note> where he expected
<hi>Dom Diogo de Almeyda</hi> with one hundred and fifty Horse,

shedding his Blood on the Cross of his Martyrdome.</p>
            <p>63. The Enemy was quartered at a Town call'd
<hi>Morgaon,</hi> not farr from <hi>Agacaim;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He falls on the Enemy.</note> the Governour having

<hi>Cochim,</hi> and Citizens of <hi>Goa;</hi> the second (which he
kept for himself) was made up of all the Gentlemen
and Souldiers of the Fleet, who in their Wings had the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57115:137"/>
City-horse, in this order did he March, sending some
Horse before to discover the Camp.</p>
            <p>64. The <hi>Moors</hi> were spread without Order or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
as men who neither fear'd nor expected an
Enemy; some of their Souldiers, who went up and
down the Camp, spy'd our Colours, and by their sight,
or intelligence,<note place="margin">They fly.</note> knowing the Governour look't out for
'em, went in a fright to advise <hi>Cala Batecaon,</hi> aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our strength, which their fear, and the distance
made greater. The <hi>Turk</hi> alarm'd at the approach of
so Victorious Arms, was not Master of more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then by his Flight to be an example to his men;
they left in their quarters, Tents, Provision, and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
and what meat was for Supper, then almost ready;
for the difficulty of our March a most necessary and
pleasant Booty. The Governour by this Flight began
to be in possession of the Land and Victory.</p>
            <p>65. The <hi>Moors</hi> went over a deep River, only to be
past by some Loggs of Wood laid across instead of a
Bridge, which the Enemy to hinder our persute cut in
pieces, yet in so much haste, as the Earth which fell
down, left open a passage, not without difficulty,
though without danger.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dom Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varo,</hi> follows 'em.</note> 
               <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> in this place set
upon passing the River, beginning to wade by few at a
time, as the straightness of the ground permitted.</p>
            <p>66. The Enemy was not so out of himself as to lose
the occasion of Fighting on so eminent advantages; He
turn'd with his men to the River,<note place="margin">They turn.</note> shewing us that so
cautious fear was Stratagem. The <hi>Moors</hi> charg'd our
men as they were passing, and so were timorous, few,
and disordered; The Governour, with his Voice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and presence, encourag'd them to go over, but
fear o'recame their Obedience; the first turn'd back,
not without loss of Blood, and with worse marks then
their Wounds. At this time the Governour's impatience
attempted the River in different places. <hi>Dom Diogo
de Almeyda</hi> waded it with a Troop of Horse, finding
where he went better Foording, and Fortune, for he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57115:137"/>
fell in with the <hi>Moors</hi> General who was on Horse-back,
ordering and encouraging his men, whom he set upon
with great Bravery; The <hi>Turk</hi> with the shock fell to
the ground, but rising again without loss of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
laid hold on his Semitar, and went after <hi>Dom
Diogo,</hi> who though he lost not his Saddle, was for a
while with the force of the Blow dis-inabled, but
coming again to himself the second time charg'd the
<hi>Turk,</hi>

him) left him with many Wounds measuring the
ground.</p>
            <p>67. The other Commanders, though with difficulty,
crost the River, put upon't by the Governours example,
whom they saw engag'd with the Enemy, and was more
envy'd then obey'd by his own Souldiers, who scattered
and disordered, some cautious, others heady cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the River; but when all his men were over,
he so Vigorously charg'd the Enemy, as not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

under Colour of Friendship, where the King sent to

but was cautious and vigilant to preserve the City, for
the <hi>Bashaw</hi>'s Force and Loyalty was suspitious. The
<hi>Turk,</hi> who saw his Treason fear'd or discovered, design'd
to surprise the City by Scaling, but was afraid of the

and on that, had Recourse to an other Stratagem, more
base, and more secure, which was to excuse himself to
the King for not coming into the City, in fear to lose
the favourable Wind; that he desir'd to see him on
Board, for he was to communicate to him some business
from the Grand Signior to the great advantage of his
Kingdome. The poor King, facil, or credulous in the
good of his State, went immediately to meet the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi>
at Sea, secure in an innocent Conscience; but the
Tyrant forgetting Faith, and Humanity, made him with
Scoffs and Derision, (a cruel delight in so foul a
Treason) be Beheaded in the Galley.<note place="margin">Beheads the King.</note> 'Twas easie for
the <hi>Bashaw</hi> upon the Death of the King to seise on the
City, frighted and confus'd at the violent Murder of
their Prince; and because the <hi>Turkish</hi> Neighbourhood
cost the State blood, and trouble, we will in brief give
you this relation of the place.</p>
            <p>73. It is situate on the Coast of <hi>Arabia</hi> the happy,<note place="margin">The situation of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </note>
in twelve degrees, and fifteen minutes of <hi>Northern</hi> Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
protected by a little Mountain, which with some
Castles defends the entrance of the Harbour; it lies in
the mouth of the Straight, the Port bold, capable to
Anchor Ships of any burden, though expos'd to <hi>Wester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
winds, which are the <hi>Monsones</hi> in Summer. Art and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57115:139"/>
Nature have made it Tenable by Land, securing it from
the ambition of the Neighbour Princes and the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Mountainous <hi>Arabs,</hi> who molest the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
with troublesome Inroads; there is in the Port a
little Island, tolerably Fortify'd, call'd by the Natives
<hi>Cira,</hi> before it is an other safe Harbour, sheltered from
many Winds, where the <hi>Mecca</hi> Fleet use to come to an
Anchor. There are no Rivers or Fountains to water
the ground, it doth not sometimes Rain for two or
three years, whether it be the nature of the Clime, or
some hidden Judgment, so as they fetch their water
at a distance with <hi>Caravans</hi> of Camels. The chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
of the place is Rubarb, but that which brings
in most profit is the Anchorage of Ships which pass the
Straight. The Nation is Warlick and Cruel, goes
willingly to the Warr, though more for Plunder, then
Victory.</p>
            <p>74. The <hi>Bashaw</hi> having seis'd on the City,<note place="margin">

being a fault, their Estates a crime; the poor Peoples
suffering was more their Virtue, then Cure, for the

Galleys Royal, and some small Vessels, which fac't the
City, and coming to Anchor out of the Bay, got to
Shore, where they Pitch't their Tents and Fortify'd
their Encamping, advising the <hi>Bashaw</hi> to joyn 'em with
his Army. The <hi>Arabs</hi> on sight of so great numbers
come against 'em, came remissly to the Defence, some
Pusillanimous, others out of Heart, thought the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Strength of the Enemy insuperable, and at
private meetings blam'd the King's am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not content with the fortune of his Predecessours; but
the <hi>Portuguese</hi> amongst 'em, observing the brightest

convincing the Resistance to be necessary and possible,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57115:142"/>
offering themselves afresh to be the voluntary Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of their Fortune; enough to put new Courage
in 'em, upon which they vow'd to Dye in their defence,
not so much out of Obligation as Example.</p>
            <p>86. The <hi>Turks</hi> Besieg'd the City,<note place="margin">Lay Siege.</note> by raising two
Batteries with pieces on 'em of an extravagant bigness,
two amongst the rest (by them call'd <hi>Quartaos</hi>) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd

depriv'd the <hi>Arabs</hi> of the Victory, ours of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

deserv'd better Assistance from our Arms. The Enemy,

continued his Assaults, which brought on again the
Speech of a Surrender, which the Prince always broke

off, constant to himself, and the State; but danger,
famine, and despair, prevail'd with some of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
to give up a secret Gate to the Enemy, at which
he entred the City. The Prince fighting with Royal,

under the Prow of their Galleys, and seeing it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

of the Night freed himself. <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> with the
Gentlemen and Souldiers of the Fleet, betray'd a just
resentment at the News, valuing less the loss of that
State, then the foil of our Arms, because both amongst

the Deaths of his Brother-in-law, and Nephew,

                  <p>96. <q>VIce-King, I the Queen heartily salute you.
I have read your Letter in which you give
us a particular account of what you have done, and
ordered in all those things you thought to be for the
service of our Lord the King, and for the defence and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57115:146"/>
security of those Parts, and that all was so confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to what you are, and to the opinion his Majesty
hath of you, we have as much satisfaction, as 'tis
reasonable; both to see his Majesty is so well serv'd by
you, and for the signal honour you have purchas'd.
As to the great care and diligence, you upon your
Arrival employ'd in the repairing, and providing the
Fleet, 'twas a great beginning, and of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
for the remedying so weighty affairs as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
presented; and we are assur'd how great soever
the pains you took in it were, your content of having
been so well employ'd, will be greater; you aim'd
right in the Warr you made upon <hi>Hidalcaon,</hi> because
by that was clearly seen the contrary to what you say,
is there the receiv'd opinion; that he could receive
no harm by a Warr with the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> (which must
be the reason he so often begun it) nor have any
benefit by Peace with 'em, which made him not care
to break it; and if he knew who you were, and how
much more prevalent honour then profit is with you,
he would not have made you the offer he did about
<hi>Meale,</hi> but the little impression it had on you, and
your evident undeceiving him, will make him know
it. As to the business of the Siege, and Warr of the
Fortress of <hi>Dio,</hi> the mercy of our Lord God was
eminent in the Victory he there gave you against so
great Force, and numbers, of the Enemies of his holy
Catholick faith, as were there from so remote Parts
met together, and 'tis an evident sign of his own Arms
upholding the State in those Countries; and for all,
we give him the praises, as are reasonable, and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be due; and it much adds to the great
satisfaction, our Lord the King, and We have for so
great a Victory, to see with what prudence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
you provided all things necessary for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; how stoutly you behav'd your self in the day
of Battail, and with what diligence you reliev'd that
Fortress, exposing for it your Sons in so Stormy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57115:146"/>
the Notion his Majesty and we have of all
these Actions, and of the great benefit which is the
consequence of 'em, is very proportionable to their
quality and greatness; and we hope his Majesty will
shew it so, in the honour and thanks he intends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
you, because all is your due; and he gave no
small sign of it, by his pleasure and satisfaction immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to begin it, as you will see by his Letters to you
and your Son <hi>Dom Alvaro.</hi> We were not a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
at the Death of your Son <hi>Dom Fernando,</hi> as
well for our knowledge how you must take it, as for
the loss of his Person, which (as he shew'd in that
Action) was eminently great; but we so well know
you, and your great Prudence and Virtue, as to be
certain, that at whatsoever time our Lord God should
take him to himself, you would conform to his Will,
and accept it at his Hand; especially it being then,
when for the defence of his Faith, and in so signal
Service for his Majesty, he Dy'd so honourably, and
was not wanting to the Obligation of being what
he was, which are very convincing reasons that you
ought so to take it, and very much less resent his
Death. As for what you sollicit us in, about your
return, in which your Wife <hi>Dona Leonor</hi> (whom we
were very joyfull to see, for the deserts of her Person
and Virtues, and out of the great affection we have
for her) hath spoke to us in your behalf, as in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
she so much desires, we should be very glad if
we could in that gratifie your self and her with the
good liking and satisfaction of our Lord the King;
but for the good Service you have done his Majesty,
and the great miss might be there of your Person
in such a time, he hath thought good to make use of
you there for three years longer, as you will see by his
Letter; and we assure our selves, that for those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
you will take it well, and we very much
desire you it may be so, and hope in our Lord he will
give you health and vigour to perform it, and will
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57115:147"/>
assist and strengthen you in all your difficulties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the result of 'em is so much for his Service, and
he knows the main design his Majesty hath in desiring
it should be so, is because of his knowledge that his
Service will by you there be unfeignedly promov'd;
and by your remembring, amongst so many troubles
and so important businesses, those things of Ours, you
took into your care, it is evident, how great a desire
you have in that, and all other things to serve us,
which we so look upon as is reason; for what concerns
<hi>Diogo Voz</hi> we have in an other Letter writ to you,
what we desire should be done. We were very much
pleas'd with that perfume of <hi>Benjoim de Boninas,</hi> and
with all the other things you sent us by <hi>Lourenco Pirez
de Tavora,</hi> all being so good, as they seem to be sent
with that good Will which we esteem the most, and
take all very well of you; and about those Servants
of Ours, and Persons, who, (as you write us) have
serv'd well there, and about those things, you think
it necessary to provide, we will mind our Lord the
King, as you desire, it should be done. That which
his Majesty hath to look too, in the Rewards he
ought to bestow on all those who have there ferv'd
him, is to take notice of what you have writ to him,
and of what you desire, as 'tis reason he should; we
take very well of you, the good Character you give
his Majesty of those our Servants, who were present
at the Action of <hi>Dio,</hi> and also the many Favours, and
great Civilities, we know for our sake you shew'd
them.</q>

                  <p>97. <q>HOnourable Vice-King. I receiv'd your
Letter which came in <hi>Lourenco Pirez de
Tavora</hi>'s Fleet, in which you tell me you receiv'd mine
I sent by <hi>Lewis Fiqueira,</hi> and I take very well of you,
your telling me, the advice I gave you seem'd good
to you, and the more, your putting it in practice,
and, though I had not known you, I had sufficient
cause to believe it was so, by hearing what you do
there, and seeing you write so plainly your difficulties,
Poverty, and Abstinence, weapons by which are o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, who reign
so absolutely in those parts of <hi>India,</hi> a Victory, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then that of the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> or of all the
Force of the <hi>Turk;</hi> for which as long as you Live
you ought to fear nothing, but be confident in our
Lord God, that he will assist you, as he hath lately
done in the Defence and Battail of <hi>Dio,</hi> for which
Victory you have great cause to praise him, who hath
made you an Instrument of so much Service to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and to my Lord the King, of so much honour
to your Self, and to all the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> to the absent,
as to those who were present. And certain it is, that
in that expedition, from the first day you had the
News of the Siege of <hi>Dio,</hi> till that of yours and our
Victory, (according to my reach) you have done
what could be done, by a Stout, and Prudent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
as well in your speedy Succours, as in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
your Sons as the marks of Fortune, to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the Winter and Seas of <hi>India,</hi> that others
might less apprehend 'em, by which is clearly evinc't,
how much a greater share the Service of my Lord the
King, and the Obligation of your charge, have in
you, then the natural affections of a Father, which
are those most Tyrannically over-rule our Nature.
And by the patience you shew'd in the Death of your
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57115:148"/>
Son <hi>Dom Fernando de Castro,</hi> you have eminently
clear'd this opinion. It's certain I resented it for my
self and you, and by the certain signs I saw in him of
an extraordinary Courage took it for a very great
loss; and believe God design'd in that to recompence
him, by taking him out of this so troublesome Life
by so honourable means, and so much for his glory,
which ought to be no little part of your Consolation.
Your Son <hi>Dom Alvaro de Castro</hi> employ'd not his time
ill when through so many difficulties, and dangers he
reliev'd the Fortress of <hi>Dio,</hi> at that time, when its
only remedy was his Arrival, and, for his Behaviour
there, his falling on the Enemies Posts, and all the rest
of his Carriage, I do for my self, and you, give him
many blessings. And to return to your resolution of
venturing your Person, and the State of <hi>India,</hi> for the
relief of <hi>Dio,</hi> 'twas well taken, for had you not done
it, there had been the same hazard; and your arrival
at <hi>Dio,</hi> your ordering your Fleet, your commanding
the Landing of your men when the Battail was to be
given, and your way of Fighting, all this seems to
me to deserve that we now and ever give praises to
our Lord God, and that his Majesty should conferr
on you many honours, which he hath already begun
as you'l see concerning your Self and Son; He also
ought and will do the same to those Cavalliers, and
Gentlemen, who serv'd under you in that expedition,
especially to <hi>Dom Iohn Mascarenhas,</hi> who behav'd
himself in the weight of that Siege like an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Commander, and brave Cavallier. I was very
glad to see your manner of writing to his Majesty,
about the Service the Gentlemen, and Cavalliers who
went thither, did in the business of <hi>Dio,</hi> by which it
appears, you even scores with their deservings. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
do so for my sake, and be glad to praise Persons;
for it being certain, there will not want those men
who will speak ill of them, (which you ought to
punish where you find it) it is but reason the good
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57115:148"/>
should extoll them, that those you cannot there
Reward, his Majesty may by your information do it.
I spoke (as you writ to me) about your return,
which his Majesty granted me not, and gave me for it
two Reasons, and in my opinion, though you have
many to countenance your desire of returning, his
Majesty hath many more to desire your Service for
three years longer in that Government, which you
ought to be glad to do, to serve God, for the great
mercy he shew'd you, and his Majesty for his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in you, and satisfaction in your Service; Rely
on God for his giving you strength to grapple with
the great difficulties and disorders of <hi>India,</hi> and I
trust in him, that after such a performance you'l re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to fill these tops of the Rocks of <hi>Sintra</hi> with
Chapels, and Trophies of your Victories, and that
you'l visit and enjoy 'em in a profound repose. I
speak not to you about particular businesses, because
my Lord the King hath writ to you in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
his Service in answer to the general Letter
you writ him, which came in a very good style, and
well digested.</q>

            <p>98. 'Tis apparent by these Letters how well the
Royal Family took the Services of <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro,</hi>
the King deny'd <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> the leave he ask't to come
and rest himself in the Kingdome for the good of his
Country and the <hi>East,</hi> he added to his Government
three years more, with the Title of Vice-Roy. He
Liv'd not to enjoy, though deserve, this addition of
honour; He had given him ten thousand <hi>Crusades,</hi> as
a Gratuity towards the Defraying charges, and Letters
Patents for his Son <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> to be Admiral of the
Seas of <hi>India,</hi> an employment he Computed by fewer
Years then Victories.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:57115:149"/>
99. The King <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> by the advices of the Vice-Roy,
understood, that the security of <hi>India</hi> requir'd
always Forces ready, for all occurrences of the State,
and that the defeat of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> (whose Ruine was an
example for the rest) had created hatred as well as
reverence in the Neighbouring Princes; on these and
other considerations he sent this year for <hi>India</hi> six Ships,<note place="margin">The King sends six Ships for <hi>India.</hi>
               </note>
which parted in different Seasons. <hi>Martim Correa da
Sylva,</hi> who brought a Commission for the Fortress of

parted in <hi>November,</hi> the other Commanders were <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio
Pereira,</hi> and <hi>Christovaon de Sa;</hi> The Admiral Ship,
having on the Coast of <hi>India</hi> adverse Winds fell off from
her course, and not able to reach <hi>Goa,</hi> recovered <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diva,</hi>
whence she sent to the Vice-Roy to provide her
with necessaries, being forc't to Winter in that Port.
<hi>Christovaon de Sa</hi>'s Pilot knew better to shape his course,
for as soon as he made the Coast of <hi>India,</hi> he bore up
to get the Wind of <hi>Goa,</hi> and saw Land about <hi>Carapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taon,</hi>
whence he came directly for the Barr.</p>
            <p>100. As soon as the Vice-Roy knew there was a
Ship come in from the Kingdome,<note place="margin">One come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to <hi>Goa.</hi>
               </note> he gave orders for
Landing the Sick, and went in Person to visit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for 'em. And certain it is, that amongst all the
Excellencies of this extraordinary Vice-Roy, we may
Rank his Charity in the Front, it not being a Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
virtue in a Souldier, much less in a publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
He receiv'd his Letters, in which he found those
honours and gratuities we have related, these he look't
upon as payment, those as a recompence, for which the
Gentlemen gave to each other the joy, as satisfy'd the
Vice-Roy should continue his Government three years
longer, in whom they knew the State would have a
Man, the Soldiery a Father.</p>
            <p>101. <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro</hi> found himself less spent by
his Years then the Difficulties of so long a Warr,<note place="margin">The Vice-King falls Sick.</note> which
made him succumb under the pressure of so perplex't a
Solicitude; He fell Desperately ill, and his Sickness in

few days betray'd mortal Symptoms, which he, by the
Vexatiousness of repeated accidents perceiving, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened
himself of the weight of the Government:
He call'd for the Bishop <hi>Dom Iohn de Albuquerque, Dom

Overseer of the Revenue, to whom he delivered
up the State, in Peace with the Neighbouring Princes,
secur'd by so many Victories. He sent for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy
of the City, the Vicar General of <hi>India,</hi> the
Guardian of Saint <hi>Francis, Frier Antonio do Casal,</hi> Saint
<hi>Francisco Xaverius,</hi> and the Officers of the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venne,
before whom he made this Speech.</p>
            <p>102. <q>I am not asham'd Gentlemen to tell you,<note place="margin">He speaks to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> that
the Vice-Roy of <hi>India</hi> wants in this Sickness those
conveniencies the meanest Souldier finds in the Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals;
I came to Serve not to Traffick in the <hi>East,</hi> I
would to your selves have pawn'd the Bones of my
Son, and did pawn the hairs of my Beard, to assure
you I had no other Plate, or Hangings. There was
not this day Money enough in the House to Buy me
a Hen; for in the Fleets I set forth, the Souldiers fed
upon the Governours Salary, before the King's pay,
and 'tis no wonder for the Father of so many Children
to be poor. I request of you, during the time of this
Sickness, to order me out of the King's Revenue a
proportionable maintenance, and to appoint a Person
of your own who may provide me a moderate allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</q>
And asking presently for a Missal, he took his
Oath on the Gospel,<note place="margin">The Oath he takes.</note> he was not then Debitor one
<hi>Crusade</hi> to the King's Revenue, or had receiv'd any thing
from <hi>Christian, Iew, Moor,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> or for the carrying
out the Authority of his Place, or Person, had any other
Houshold-stuff then what he brought from <hi>Portugal,</hi>
and that he had here spent the Money he had got in the
Kingdome; that he had not where withall to Buy an
other Quilt, then that they saw on his Bed; that he had
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57115:150"/>
only made a Sword for his Son <hi>Dom Alvaro</hi> to return
into the Kingdome, and set the Hilt with some Jewels
of small value. That he desir'd they would enter a
Protest of this, that if at any time the King found it
otherwise, he might punish him for perjury. This
Speech was writ in the City-Books, which, they who
succeeded might read for their Instruction, with whom
I believe the Memory is more pregnant then the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>103. As soon as the Vice-Roy perceiv'd himself sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd

               </note> he secluded himself with the

a Voyage so secure a Pilot, who all the time of his
Sickness, was his Nurse, Reconciler, and Governour;
As he had got no Riches to make a new Disposal of, he
made no other Will then that he left (at his coming
to Govern <hi>India</hi>) in the Kingdome, in the hands of
<hi>Dom Rodrigo Pinheiro</hi> Bishop of <hi>Angra,</hi> to whom he had
Communicated it; and receiving the Sacraments of the
Church,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> he gave up his Soul to God the sixth of <hi>Iune</hi>
one thousand five hundred forty eight, in the eight and
fortieth Year of his Age, and almost three of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of that State. The Riches he gain'd in <hi>Asia</hi>
were his Heroick actions, which Posterity will read in
this Book with a tender Memory. In his Study were
found three pieces of small Money, and a Discipline
which seem'd to have been often us'd, and the Locks of
his Beard he had pawn'd; He ordered his Body should
be Deposited in Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Church in <hi>Goa,</hi> thence

out of respect to the Memory of the Grand-father, and
Piety of the Grand-child.</p>
            <p>105. Saint <hi>Dominicks</hi> Convent of <hi>Bemfica</hi> is two
Miles from <hi>Lisbone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Where they now are.</note> nam'd so, from a Neighbouring
Village. 'Twas always in the possession of the Kings of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> where for the freshness of the Air, they had a
Country-house, which they went to for Diversion of
business, or the exercise of Hunting. King <hi>Iohn</hi> the
First, finding himself indebted to God for so many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
amongst other Acts of Thanksgiving, gave this
Palace to the order of Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> with the Adjacent
grounds, Gardens and Orchards, the twenty second of
<hi>May,</hi> one thousand three hundred ninety and nine, for
the Founding a Convent, which was not only Founded
but Augmented by our Kings. The Founder oblig'd
himself, by his Letters Patents (preserv'd in the Archives
of the Convent) to protect, and defend the cause, the
persons, and goods of the Religious, Sollicitous in God's
cause, Couragious in his own. King <hi>Iohn</hi> the Second
endow'd it with a great Revenue, which the House
now enjoys under the Name of the Fifth of the Islands,
without imposing any new Obligation, which might
render the Alms less Liberal, or Acceptable; the King
<hi>Dom Emanuel,</hi> though Distracted with greater Cares
and Buildings, left in the Sacrifices of this Temple, a
Religious memory, ordering that twice in a Week should
be Sung two Masses to the Angels, in the behalf of those
who were at Sea; this was in that Age the Astrolabe
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57115:151"/>
of his Discoveries, and the Abetter of the Victories in
the <hi>East.</hi> The Queen <hi>Dona Katherina,</hi> look't upon this
House as her private Chapel, offering here from her own
Oratory, Reliques of Veneration, and Value, amongst
others, in a great Silver Cross a piece of the holy Cross,
which offering from Royal hands doth assure the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of so inestimable a present; Our Princes confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
on this House temporal and spiritual benefits.
King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, augmented with an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Alms, those it before enjoy'd. This Convent hath
always been for the strictest observers of the Religion,
who under the name of Recolets allow no Swerving
or Indulgence from the first institution; hither as to a
School of Virtues, use to retire the most eminent of the
Order, some to avoid, others to be at rest after their
Prelacies, in a holy leisure to be untaken up but by God,
and to reform their Affections.</p>
            <p>106. In this Convent, Illustrious for its Foundation,
and Discipline, rest the Victorious Ashes of <hi>Dom Iohn
de Castro,</hi> in a Chapel, and Monument of a Religious
greatness. The Chapel is Consecrated by the name of
<hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> hath the great Door into the Cloister
of the Convent, and over that in a Scutcheon of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Arms of the Founder; the wideness of the
Door takes in forty Palmes, the height above seventy,
a proportion the Architects name <hi>Dupla,</hi> and the work
is <hi>Dorick.</hi> 'Tis only of one Isle of polish't Marble, the
Pavement also is of diverse Colour'd and Polish't stones;
there goes about it within, a well-orderded, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
Pedestal, which sustains the Decency of an
uniform Building; it contains six Arches (with Pilastres
between) upon their Bases, and with their Capitals;
there goes also a Cornish round about, it hath six Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
proportionable to the rest of the Architecture.
On the high Altar is a Tabernacle, (in which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
kept the blessed Sacrament, lighted by two silver
Lamps) behind it an Altar-piece, both of Carv'd work,
with great Flowers all Gilded, and on the top, a
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57115:151"/>
Picture of our Saviour's last Supper; behind the high
Altar, and Altar-piece is the Quire for the Novices, for
whose better Breeding, and Service of God, is made a
House with twenty Cells, and diverse Offices which
form the Body of a distinct Convent. The Roof of the
Chapel above the Finishment of the Cornish is also of
Stone, divided into Compartments with rich Mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Of the six Arches which make the whole, the two
first are on the plain of the Altar; on the Gospel-side
is a Door goes up to the top of the Building, and the
Founder's Lodgings; on the side of the Epistle, is an
other goes into the Sachristy. The other four are taken
up with four costly Monuments, with Urns of Burnish't
stones which rest on the Backs of Elephants of black
Marble.</p>
            <p>107. In the first Arch which joyns to the plain of
the Altar, on the Gospel-side is the Monument of <hi>Dom
Iohn de Castro,</hi> in which before 'twas clos'd were laid his
Bones with the following Epitaph.</p>

Virtues, was Born in <hi>Lisbone</hi> the 27th. of <hi>February</hi> of the

<hi>Dom Alvaro de Castro,</hi> Governour of the House of <hi>Civil,</hi>
and to <hi>Dona Leonor de Noronha,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Dom
Iohn de Almeyda</hi> second Earl of <hi>Abrantes;</hi> Grand-child
to <hi>Dom Garcia de Castro,</hi> who was Brother to <hi>Dom Alvaro

to <hi>Dom Fernando de Castro,</hi> Grand-children to <hi>Dom

of <hi>Portugal,</hi> Brother to the Queen <hi>Dona Inez de
Castro,</hi> Wife to King <hi>Dom Pedro</hi> the Cruel. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,
was Son to <hi>Dom Pedro Fernandez de Castro,</hi> call'd
(in <hi>Castile</hi>) the Man of Warr, who coming into this
Kingdome, begun here the Illustrious house of the
<hi>Castros,</hi> which hath preserv'd it self in so much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<hi>Dom Pedro</hi> by the Male line descended from
the <hi>Infante Dom Fernando,</hi> Son to King <hi>Dom Garcia</hi> of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> who Married <hi>Dona Maria Alvarez de Castro,</hi>
the only Daughter of the Earl <hi>Alvaro Fanhez Minaya,</hi>
the fifth Grand-child in descent from <hi>Lain Calvo,</hi> from
whom this Family derives its beginning. <hi>Dom Iohn de
Castro</hi> when very young Marry'd <hi>Dona Leonor Coutinho</hi>
his Cousin-German once remov'd, greater for her
Quality, then Portion, with whom retiring to the Town
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57115:153"/>
of <hi>Almada,</hi> he by an Antidated old Age avoided the
ambition of the Court; He went to serve at <hi>Tangiers,</hi>
where he gave the first, but extraordinary proofs of
his Courage, though of his Actions there, we have more
from his Fame then our Knowledge. He return'd to
Court, re-call'd by the King <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> the third, and
the Kingdome being too narrow for his Gallantry went
to <hi>India</hi> with <hi>Dom Garcia de Noronha;</hi> He accompany'd
<hi>Dom Estevaon de Gama</hi> in his expedition to the Mouth
of the Red-Sea, and made a Journal of his Voyage, a
usefull and acceptable work to Sea-men. On his return
to <hi>Portugal</hi> he retir'd to his Country-house at <hi>Sintra,</hi>
recreating himself by Reading, in his Solitudes, and
employments always Exemplary; He put on his Sword
again to follow the Eagles of <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperour in
the Battail of <hi>Tunez,</hi> where he rais'd his name with new
Glory; when this design was over, hiding himself
from his own Fame, he again retir'd to <hi>Sintra,</hi> knowing
how to avoid, not keep himself from employments.
The King <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> made him Admiral of the Navy of
the Coast, a Service where his Courage was answered
by Success; He went last of all to Govern <hi>India,</hi> where,
by the Victories we have related, he secur'd, and brought
into reputation the State. When the designs of Warr
spar'd him, he in a large Card describ'd all the Coast
betwixt <hi>Goa,</hi> and <hi>Dio,</hi> marking the Flats, and Shelves,
the height of the Pole in which the Cities lye; the
depth of Water, Anchoring, and Creeks which form
the Havens; the Trade-winds, and Nature of those
Seas; the force of the Currents, the swiftness of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
disposing the Lines in different Tables, all, with
so minute and exact Geography, as only this Work
might serve to make him Famous, if he were not so
eminently, for his great Fortitude. He look't the same
in his streights at Home, and prosperity in the <hi>East,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
always the same Man in diverse Fortunes; his
Ambition was to deserve all things, and ask nothing;
He equally did reason and justice to all men, unbyast in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57115:153"/>
his Punishments, but so Justifiable, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
were more against the Law then Minister. He
was free to the Souldiers, sparing to his Children, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more civility in his Office, then Nature; He us'd
with a great deal of Ceremony the Actions of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours,
honouring even those he put not in practice;
without prostituting his Civility, he preserv'd his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
He appear'd above the Great ones, and Father
of the Meanest; such was his Life, as by that, more then
by Punishments, he reform'd extravagancies; his first
Zeal was always in God's cause, then in the States; he
past no Virtue without Reward, some Vices without
Punishment; amending not a few, some by Favours,
others by Clemency.<note place="margin">Iohn de Barro'<hi>s Hist. of</hi> India, <hi>Dec. 6. Lib. 1. Pag.</hi> 4.</note> The presents he receiv'd from the
Prince of <hi>Asia,</hi> he put to the King's Revenue, a Virtue
all prais'd, few imitated; the maimed Souldiers found
him Sollicitous in their Cure, and Compassionate of
their Condition; He oblig'd every one, yet seem'd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to all; He kept the Souldiers (as what would
prove the Ruine of the State) from Merchandizing;
He set upon no Action, which he did not atchieve,
being ready in Execution, mature in Counsel: amidst
the employments of a Souldier, he preserv'd the virtues
of a Religious man, was frequent in visiting Temples,
a great honourer of Church-men, mercifull and liberal
to the Poor; had great Devotion to the Cross of
Christ, which he Reverenc'd in its Figure, by a low
inclination without any difference of time or place;
and so Religiously was he fir'd with the Worship of this
most holy Representative, as he rather chose to Build a
Temple to its Memory, then raise a House to his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
leaving it on his Fatherly blessing to his Son <hi>Dom
Alvaro,</hi> that if he found in the favour, or justice of the
King, any recompence for his Services, he should with
that Build a Convent for the <hi>Franciscan</hi> Recollets in
the Mountain of <hi>Sintra,</hi> and name the House <hi>The invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Holy Cross. Dom Alvaro de Castro,</hi> Heir
apparent to the virtues of so pious a Father, gave order
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57115:154"/>
for Building the Convent, not so great for the Majesty
of the Pile, as for the Sanctity of the Penitents who In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
there. Being the first time sent from King <hi>Dom
Sebastian</hi> Embassadour to Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, he
obtain'd of him to priviledge the Altar of the Convent
for all Masses, and on the day of the Invention of the
Cross, Plenary indulgence to all those who pray'd for
the pressing necessities of the Church, and designedly
for the Soul of <hi>Dom Iohn de Castro;</hi> so singular and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
a grace as we have not known granted to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Princes. It is apparent, the Fame of his Victories
was as loud in <hi>Italy,</hi> as that of his Virtues, attested by
so Illustrious a testimony from the Vicar of Christ; for
these and other Virtues we believe he now enjoys in
Heaven nobler Palmes in a more eminent Triumph. He
had three Sons,<note place="margin">His Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> who all expos'd themselves to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of Warr, as their Fathers blessing; <hi>Dom Miguel</hi>
the Youngest, who in the Reign of King <hi>Dom Sebastian</hi>
went to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and Dy'd in the Government of
<hi>Malaca; Dom Fernando</hi> burnt in the Mine at <hi>Dio; Dom

Lord of the House of <hi>Monsanto;</hi> He was a particular
