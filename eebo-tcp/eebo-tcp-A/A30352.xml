            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first step that was made in the <hi>Reformation</hi> of this
Church, was the restoring to your Royal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors the Rights of the Crown, and
an entire Dominion over all their Subjects; of which they had been disseised by
the craft and violence of an unjust Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender: to whom the Clergy, though your
Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Progenitors had enriched them, by a bounty no less profuse than
ill-managed, did not only adhere, but drew with them the Laity, over whose
Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences they had gained so absolute an Authority, that our Kings were to
expect no Obedience from their people, but what the Popes were pleased to
allow.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Nobler part of the Nation did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in
Parliament, assert the Regal Prerogatives against those Papal invasions; yet
these were but faint endeavours, for an ill-executed Law is but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
match to a Principle strongly infused into the Consciences of the people.</p>
            <p>But how different was this from the teaching of Christ and his
Apostles? They forbad men to use all those Arts by which the Papacy grew up and
yet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists: <pb facs="tcp:104314:5"/> They exhorted them to obey Magistrates, when they
knew it would cost them their Lives: They were for setting up a Kingdom, not of
this World, nor to be attained but by a holy and peaceable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. If this
might every-where take place, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would find Government both easie and
secure: It would raise in their Subjects the truest courage, and unite them
with the firmest charity: It would draw from them Obedience to the Laws, and
Reverence to the persons of their Kings. If the Standards of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and
Charity, which the Gospel gives, of doing as we would be done by, and loving
our Neighbours as our selves, were made the measures of mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how
steadily would Societies be governed, and how exactly would Princes be
obeyed!</p>
            <p>The design of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> was to restore
Christianity to what it was at first, and to purge it of those Corruptions,
with which it was over-run in the later and darker Ages.</p>
            <p>GREAT SIR, This work was carryed on by a slow and unsteady
Progress under King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII; it advanced in a fuller and freer
course un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the short but blessed Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi>; was Sealed
with the blood of many Martyrs under Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; was brought to a full
settlement in the happy and glorious days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; was
defended by the learned Pen of King <hi>Iames</hi>; but the established frame
of it, under which it had so long flourished, was overthrown with your
Majesties bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Father, who fell with it, and honoured it by his unexempled
Suffering for it; and was again restored to its former beauty and order, by
your Majesties happy Return.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104314:5"/>What remains to compleat and perpetuate this Blessing,
the composing of our differences at home, the establishing a closer
correspondence with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches abroad, the securing us from the
restless and wicked practices of that Party, who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped so lately to have been
at the end of their designs; and that which can only entitle us to a Blessing
from God, the Reforming of our manners and lives, as our Ancestors did our
Doctrine and Worship; All this is reserved for your Majesty, that it may
appear, that your Royal Title of Defender of the Faith is no empty sound, but
the real strength and Glory of your Crown.</p>
            <p>For attaining these ends, it will be of great use to trace the
steps of our first Reformers; for if the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks they set be observed, we
can hardly go out of the way. This was my chief design in the following sheets,
which I now most humbly offer to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, hoping that as you were
graciously pleased to command that I should have free access to all
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> for composing them, so you will not deny your Royal Patronage
to the History of that Work, which God grant your Majesty may live to raise to
its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and to compleat in your Reign the Glory of all your Titles.
This is a part of the most earnest as well as the daily Prayers of,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no Part of History better received than the Account of
great Changes, and Revolutions of States and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in which the Variety
of unlooked-for Accidents and Events, both entertains the Reader and improves
him.</p>
            <p>Of all Changes, those in Religion that have been sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and
signal, are enquired into with the most search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Curiosity: where the
Salvation of Souls being concern'd, the better sort are much affected; and the
Credit, Honour, and Interest of Churches and Parties draw in these, who though
they do not much care for the Religious part, yet make noise about it to serve
other Ends. The Changes that were made in Religion in the last Century have
produc'd such effects everywhere, that it is no wonder if all persons desire to
see a clear account of the several steps in which they advanced, of the
Counsels that directed them, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives both Religious and Political that
enclined men of all conditions to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in them. <hi>Germany</hi> produced a
<hi>Sleidan, France</hi> a <hi>Thuanus,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> a <hi>Frier
Paul,</hi> who have given the World as full satisfaction in what was done
beyond Sea as they could desire. And though the two last lived and died in the
Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they have delivered things to
Posterity, with so much Candour and Evenness, that their Authority is disputed
by none but those of their own Party.</p>
            <p>But while Forreign Churches have such Historians, ours at home
have not had the like good fortune: for whether it was, that the Reformers at
first presumed so far on their Legal and calm proceedings, on the continued
Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of their Clergie, the Authority of the Law, and the Protection of
the Prince, that they judged it needless to write an History, and therefore
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their best pens, rather to justifie what they did, than to deliver
how it was done; or whether by a meer neglect the thing was omitted, we cannot
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. True it is, that it was not done to any degree of Exactness, when
matters were so fresh in mens memories, that things might have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
with greater Advantages, and vouch'd by better Authority, than it is to be
expected at this distance.</p>
            <p>They were soon after much provok'd by <hi>Sanders</hi> History,
which he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the World in Latine: yet either despising a writer, who
did so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently deliver falshoods, that from his own Book many of them may
be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, or expecting a Command from Authority, they did not then set
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. The best account I can give of their silence is, that most of
<hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Calumnies being levelled at Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whose
birth and parents he designed chiefly to disgrace, it was thought too tender a
point by her wise Counsellors to be much enquired into: it gave too great
credit to his Lies, to answer them; an answer would draw forth a Reply, by
which those Calumnies would still be kept alive; and therefore it was not
without good reason thought <pb facs="tcp:104314:7"/> better to let them lie unanswered and
despised. From whence it is come that in this age that Author is in such
Credit, that now he is quoted with much as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance: most of all the writers in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> relie on his testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as a good authority. The
Collectors of the General History of that Age, follow his thred closely, some
of them transcribe his very words. One <hi>Pollini</hi> a Dominican, published
an History of the Changes that were made in <hi>England,</hi> in
<hi>Italian</hi> at <hi>Rome Anno. 1594.</hi> which he should more ingenuously
have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Translation, or Paraphrase of <hi>Sanders</hi> History: and of
late more can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, but no less maliciously, one of the best pens of
<hi>France</hi> has been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to translate him into their language, which
has created such prejudices in the minds of many there, that our Reformation,
which generally was more modestly spoken of, even by those who wrote against
it, is now look'd on by such as read <hi>Sanders,</hi> and believe him, as one
of the foulest things that ever was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fox</hi> for all his Voluminous Work, had but few things in
his eye when he made his Collection, and designed only to discover the
Corruptions and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties of the Roman Clergie, and the Sufferings and
Constancy of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. But his work was written in haste, and there are
so many defects in it, that it can by no means be called a Compleat History of
these times; though I must add, that having compared his Acts and Monuments
with the Records, I have never been able to discover any errors or
prevarications in them, but the utmost fidelity and exactness. <hi>Parker</hi>
Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed only in his account of the
<hi>British Antiquities,</hi> to do justice and honour to his See, and so gives
us barely the life of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> with some few and general hints of what
he did. <hi>Hall</hi> was but a superficial Writer, and was more careful to get
full informations of the Cloaths that were worn at the Interviews of Princes,
Iusts, Tournaments, and great Solemnities, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Counsels, or secret
Transactions of the time he lived in. <hi>Holing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shead, Speed,</hi> and
<hi>Stow,</hi> give bare Relations of things that were Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and commit
many faults. Upon their scent most of our later Writers have gone, and have
only collected and repeated what they wrote.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> judged it unworthy of him to trifle as
others had done, and therefore made a more narrow search into Records and
original Papers, than all that had gone before him; and with great fidelity and
industry, has given us the History of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. But in
the Transactions that concern Religion, he dwells not so long as the matter
required, leaving those to men of another Profession, and judging it perhaps
not so proper for one of his condition to pursue a full and accurate Deduction
of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>Since he wrote, two have undertaken the Ecclesiastical History,
<hi>Fuller</hi> and <hi>Heylin.</hi> The former got into his hands some few
Papers, that were not seen before he published them; but being a man of fancie,
and affecting an odd way of writing, his work gives no great Satisfaction. But
Doctor <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> wrote smoothly and handsomly, his Method and Stile are
good, and his work was generally more read than any thing that had appeared
before him: but either he was very ill informed, or very much led by his
Passions; and he being wrought on by most violent prejudices against some that
were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that time, delivers many things in such a manner and so
strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that one would think he had been secretly set on to it by those of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though I doubt not he was a sincere Protestant,
but vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently carried away by some particular conceits. In one thing he is not
to be excused, That he never vouched any Authority for what he writ, which is 
<pb facs="tcp:104314:7"/> not to be forgiven any who write of Transactions beyond their own
time, and deliver new things not known before. So that upon what grounds he
wrote a great deal of his Book we can only conjecture, and many in their
guesses are not apt to be very favourable to him.</p>
            <p>Things being delivered to us with so much alloy and uncertainty,
those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do confidently disparage our Reformation.
The short History of it, as it is put in their mouths, being, That it was begun
by the lusts and passions of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, carried on by the
Ravenousness of the Duke of <hi>Summerset,</hi> under <hi>Edward</hi> the
Sixth, and confirmed by the Policy of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Council
to secure her Title. These things being generally talked and spread abroad in
Forreign parts, especially in <hi>France,</hi> by the new Translation of
<hi>Sanders,</hi> and not being yet sufficiently cleared, many have desired to
see a fuller and better account of those Transactions than has yet been given;
so the thing being necessary, I was the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to set about it by
some persons of great Worth and Eminence, who thought I had much leisure and
other good Opportunities to go through with it, and wished me to undertake it.
The person that did engage me chiefly to this work, was on many Accounts much
fitter to have undertaken it himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most Indefatigable in his
Industry, and the most Iudicious in his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, of any I know, and is
one of the greatest Masters of Stile now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. But being engaged in the
service of the Church, in a station that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords him very little leisure, he
set me on to it, and furnished me with a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Collection of his own
Observations. And in some sort this work may be accounted his, for he corrected
it with a most Critical Exactness; so that the first materials, and the last
finishing of it, are from him. But after all this, I lie under such restraints
from his Modesty, that I am not allowed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish his name.</p>
            <p>I had two Objections to it, besides the knowledg of my own
unfitness for such a work. One was my Unacquaintedness with the Laws and
Customs of this Nation, not being born in it: the other was the Expence, that
such a Search as was necessary, required, which was not easie for me to bear.
My acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the most ingenious Master <hi>William Petyt</hi>
Councellour of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-Temple</hi> cleared one difficulty, he offering
me his assistance and direction, without which I must have committed great
faults. But I must acknowledg my self highly obliged by the favour and bounty
of the Honourable Master of the Rolls, Sir <hi>Harebottle Grimstone,</hi> of
whose Worth and Goodness to me I must make a large digression, if I would
undertake to say all that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will bear: The whole Nation expressed
their value of him, upon the most Signal Occasion, when they made him their
Mouth and Speaker in that Blessed Assembly which called home their King, after
which real evidence all little Commendations may be well forborn. The
Obligations he has laid on me are such, that as the Gratitude and Service of my
whole life, is the only equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn I can make for them; so as a small
tribute I judg my self obliged to make my acknowledgments in this manner, for
the leisure I enjoy under his Protection, and the Support I receive from him;
and if this work does the world any service, the best part of the Thanks is due
to him, that furnished me with particular Opportunities of Carrying it on. Nor
must I conceal the Nobleness of that Renown'd Promoter of Learning Master
<hi>Boyle,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed liberally to the Expence this Work put me
to.</p>
            <p>Upon these encouragements I set about it, and began with the
Search of all Publick Records and Offices, the <hi>Parliament</hi> and
<hi>Treaty-Rolls</hi> with all the <pb facs="tcp:104314:8"/> 
               <hi>Patent-Rolls,</hi> and the
Registers of the Sees of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and of the
<hi>Augmentation-Office.</hi> Then I laid out for all the MSS. I could hear of,
and found things beyond my Expectation in the famous <hi>Cotton</hi> Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
where there is such a Collection of Original Papers relating to these times, as
perhaps the World can shew nothing like it. I had also the favour of some MSS.
of great value, both from the Famous and eminently Learned Doctor
<hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who gave me great Assistance in this work, and from Mr.
<hi>Petyt</hi> and others. When I had look'd these over, I then used all the
Endeavours I could, to gather together the Books that were printed in those
days, from which I not only got considerable hints of matters of Fact, but
(that which I chiefly look'd for) the Arguments upon which they managed the
Controversies then on foot, of which I thought it was the part of an
Ecclesiastical Historian to give an Account, as I could recover them, that it
may appear upon what motives and grounds they proceeded.</p>
            <p>The Three chief Periods of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth his Reign, in
which Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is concerned, are, First, From the beginning of his Reign, till
the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of his Divorce with Queen <hi>Katharine</hi> commenced. The Second
is from that, till his total Breaking off from <hi>Rome,</hi> and setting up
his Supremacy over all Causes and Persons. The Third is from that, to his
Death.</p>
            <p>When I first set about this Work, I intended to have carryed on
the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Reformation to the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in
which it was finished and fully setled; but I was forced to change that
Resolution. The chief reason, among many others, was, that I have not yet been
able to discover such full Informations of what passed under the Succeeding
Reigns, as were necessary for a History; and though I have search't the publick
Registers of that time, yet I am still in the dark my self in many particulars.
This made me resolve on publishing this Volume first, hoping that those in
whose hands any Manuscripts or Papers of that time lie, will from what is now
performed, be encouraged to Communicate them: or if any have made a
considerable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in those Collections, I shall be far from envying them
the honour of such a work, in which it had been inexcusable Vanity in me to
have medled, if the desires of others, who have great Power over me, had not
prevailed with me to set about it. And therefore, though I have made a good
Advance in the following part of the Work, I shall most willingly resign it up
to any who will undertake it, and they shall have the free use of all my
Papers. But if none will set about it, who yet can furnish materials towards
it, I hope their zeal for carrying on so desired a Work, will engage them to
give all the help to it that is in their Power.</p>
            <p>There is only one passage belonging to the next Volume, which I
shall take notice of here, since from it I must plead my Excuse for several
defects, which may seem to be in this Work. In the Search I made of the Rolls
and other Offices, I wondred much to miss several Commissions, Patents, and
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writings, which by clear evidence I knew were Granted, and yet none of
them appeared on record. This I could not impute to any thing but the omission
of the Clerks, who failed in the enrolling those Commissions, though it was not
likely that matters of so high Concernment should have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected,
especially in such a Critical time, and under so severe a King. But as I
continued down my search to the Fourth year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> I found in
the Twelvth Roll of that year, a Commission, which cleared all my former
doubts, and by which I saw what was become of the things I had so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiously
searched after. We have heard of the Expurgation of Books practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed 
<pb facs="tcp:104314:8"/> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but it might have been imagined,
that publick Registers and Records would have been safe; yet lest these should
have been afterwards Confessors, it was resolved they should then be Martyrs;
for on the <hi>29</hi>th of <hi>December,</hi> in the <hi>4</hi>th year of her
Reign, a Commission was issued out under the great Seal to <hi>Bonner</hi>
Bishop of <hi>London, Cole</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and
<hi>Martine</hi> a Doctor of the Civil Law, which is of that importance, that I
shall here insert the material words of it: <hi>Whereas it is come to our
knowledg, that in the time of the late Schisme diverse Compts, Books, Scrolls,
Instruments, and other writings were practised, devised, and made, concerning
Professions against the Popes Holiness, and the See Apostolick; and also sundry
infamous Scrutinies taken in Abbeys and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religious houses, tending rather
to subvert and overthrow all good Religion and Religious houses, than for any
truth contained therein: Which being in the Custody of divers Registers, and we
intending to have those writings brought to knowledg, whereby they may be
Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and ordered according to our will and pleasure;</hi> thereupon,
those three or any two of them are empowered <hi>to cite any persons before
them, and examine them upon the Premisses upon Oath, and to bring all such
Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings before them, and certifie their diligence about it to Cardinal</hi>
Pool, <hi>that further order might be given about them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I saw this, I soon knew which way so many Writings had gone:
and as I could not but wonder at their boldness, who thus presumed to raze so
many Records; so their ingenuity in leaving this Commission in the Rolls, by
which any who had the Curiosity to search for it, might be satisfied how the
other Commissions were destroyed, was much to be commended. Yet in the
following Work, it will appear that some few Papers escaped their hands.</p>
            <p>I know it is needless to make great Protestations of my sincerity
in this Work. These are of course and are little considered, but I shall take a
more effectual way to be believed, for I shall vouch my Warrants for what I
say, and tell where they are to be found. And having copied out of Records and
MSS. many Papers of great importance, I shall not only insert the substance of
them in the following Work, but at the end of it shall give a Collection of
them at their full length, and in the Language in which they were originally
written: from which as the Reader will receive full Evidence of the truth of
this History; so he will not be ill pleased, to observe the Genius and way of
the Great men in that time, of which he will be better able to judge, by seeng
their Letters and other Papers, than by any representation made of them at
second hand. They are digested into that order, in which they are referred to
in the History.</p>
            <p>It will surprize some to see a Book of this Bigness, written of
the History of our Reformation, under the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth: since the true beginnings of it, are to be reckoned from the Reign of
King <hi>Edward,</hi> the <hi>6.</hi> in which the Articles of our Church, and
the Forms of our Worship, were first compiled and set forth by Authority. And
indeed in King <hi>Henry's</hi> time the Reformation, was rather conceived than
brought forth, and two Parties were in the last <hi>18</hi> years of his Reign
strugling in the Womb, having non and then advantages, on either side, as the
unconstant humour of that King changed, and as his Interests, and often as his
passions swayed him.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> had so dissolved his mind into pleasures,
and puffed him up with Flattery and servile Compliances, that it was not an
easie thing to serve him; for being boisterous and impatient naturally, which
was much <pb facs="tcp:104314:9"/> heightned by his most extravagant vanity, and high
conceit of his own Learning and Wisdom, he was one of the most uncounsellable
persons in the World.</p>
            <p>The Book which he wrote, had engaged him deep in these
Controversies, and by perpetual flatteries, he was brought to fancie it was
written with some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of inspiration. And <hi>Luther</hi> in his answer
had treated him so unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly, that it was only the necessity of his Affairs,
that forced him into any correspondence with that Party in
<hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi> improved every
advantage, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Kings temper, or his Affairs offered them, as much
as could be; yet they were to be pitied, having to do with a Prince, who upon
the slightest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences threw down those whom he had most advanced; which
<hi>Cromwel</hi> felt severely, and <hi>Cranmer</hi> was sometimes near it.</p>
            <p>The faults of this King being so conspicuous, and the severity of
his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings so unjustifiable, particularly that heinous violation of the
most sacred Rules of Iustice and Government, in condemning men without bringing
them to make their Answers; most of our Writers have separated the Concerns of
this Church from his Reign: and imagining that all he did, was founded only on
his Revenge upon the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> for denying his Divorce, have
taken little care to examine how matters were transacted in his time.</p>
            <p>But if we consider the great things that were done by him, we must
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there was a signal providence of God, in raising up a King of
his temper, for clearing the way to that blessed Work that followed: and that
could hardly have been done, but by a man of his humour; so that I may very
fitly apply to him the witty Simile of an ingenious writer, who compares
<hi>Luther</hi> to a <hi>Postilion</hi> in his waxed Boots and oiled Coat,
lashing his horses through thick and thin, and be spattering all about him.</p>
            <p>This Character befits King <hi>Henry</hi> better (saving the
Reverence due to his Crown) who as the <hi>Postilion of Reformation,</hi> made
way for it through a great deal of mire and filth. He abolished the Popes
Power, by which not only that Tyranny was destroyed, which had been long an
heavie burthen on this oppressed Nation; but all the Opinions, Rites, and
Constitutions, for which there was no better Authority than Papal Decrees, were
to fall to the ground; The Foundation that supported them being thus sapped. He
suppressed all the Monasteries; in which though there were some inexcusable
faults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yet he wanted not reason to do what he did. For the
Foundation of those Houses being laid on the Superstitious Conceit of Redeeming
Souls out of Purgatory, by saying Masses for them; they whose Office that was,
had by counterfeiting Relicks, by forging of Miracles, and other like
Impostures, drawn together a vast wealth, to the enriching of their Saints, of
whom some perhaps were damn'd Souls, and others were never in being. These arts
being detected, and withal their great Viciousness in some places, and in all,
their great abuse of the Christian Religion, made it seem unfit they should be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. But it was their dependence on the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which, as
the state of things then was, made it necessary that they should be supprest.
New Foundations might have done well, and the scantness of those, considering
the number and wealth of those which were suppressed, is one of the great
blemishes of that Reign. But it was in vain to endeavour to amend the old ones.
Their numbers were so great, their Riches and Interests in the Nation so
conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; that a Prince of Ordinary mettal would not have attempted such a
design, much less have compleated it in Five years time. With these fell the
Superstition of Images, Reliques, and the Redemption of Souls out of 
<pb facs="tcp:104314:9"/> Purgatory. And those Extravagant Addresses to Saints that are in
the Roman Offices were thrown out, only an <hi>Ora pro nobis</hi> was kept up,
and even that was left to the liberty of Priests, to leave it out of the
Litanies as they saw cause. These were great preparations for a Reformation.
But it went further, and two things were done, upon which a greater Change was
reasonably to be expected. The Scriptures were Translated into the
<hi>English</hi> tongue, and set up in all Churches, and every one was admitted
to read them, and they alone were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Rule of Faith. This could not
but open the eyes of the Nation, who finding a profound silence in these
writings about many things, and a direct opposition to other things that were
still retained, must needs conclude, even without deep Speculations or nice
Disputing, that many things that were still in the Church had no ground in
Scripture, and some of the rest were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to it. This
<hi>Cranmer</hi> knew well would have such an operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore made it
his chief business to set it forward, which in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion he happily
effected.</p>
            <p>Another thing was also established, which opened the way to all
that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: That every National Church was a Compleat Body within it self,
so that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with the Authority and Concurrence of
their Head, and King, might examine and Reform all Errors and Corruptions,
whether in Doctrine or Worship. All the Provincial Councils in the ancient
Church, were so many Precedents for this, who condemned Heresies, and Reformed
abuses as the occasion required. And yet these being all but parts of one
Empire, there was less reason for their doing it, without staying for a General
Council, which depended upon the pleasure of one man (the <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperor) than could be pretended, when <hi>Europe</hi> was divided into so many
Kingdoms: By which a common Concurrence of all these Churches was a thing
scarce to be expected; and therefore this Church must be in a very ill
Condition, if there could be no endeavours for a Reformation, till all the rest
were brought together.</p>
            <p>The Grounds of the new-Covenant between God and man in Christ,
were also truly stated, and the terms on which Salvation was to be hoped for,
were faithfully opened according to the New-Testament. And this being in the
strict notion of the word, <hi>the Gospel,</hi> and the glad tidings preached
through our Blessed Lord and Saviour, it must be confessed that there was a
great Progress made, when the Nation was well instructed about it; though there
was still an alloy of other Corruptions, embasing the Purity of the Faith. And
indeed in the whole progress of these changes, the Kings design seemed to have
been to terrifie the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and cudgel the Pope into a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with what he desired: for in his heart he continued addicted to
some of the most extravagant Opinions of that Church, such as
Transubstantiation and the other Corruptions in the Mass, so that he was to his
lives end more Papist than Protestant.</p>
            <p>There are two Prejudices, which men have generally drunk in
against that time. The one is, from the Kings great Enormities, both in his
personal Deportment and Government, which make many think, no good could be
done by so ill a man, and so cruel a Prince. I am not to defend him nor to
les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen his faults. The vastness and irregularity of his Expence procured many
heavy Exactions, and twice extorted a publick Discharge of his debts, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based
the Coin, with other Irregularities. His proud and impatient Spirit occasioned
many cruel proceedings. The taking so many lives, only for denying his
Supremacy, particularly <hi>Fisher's</hi> and <hi>More's,</hi> the one being
extreme old, <pb facs="tcp:104314:10"/> and the other one of the Glories of his Nation, for
Probity and Learning: The taking advantage from some Eruptions in the North, to
break the Indempnity he had before proclaimed to those in the Rebellion, even
though they could not be proved Guilty of those second disorders: His extreme
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to all Cardinal <hi>Pool's</hi> Family: his cruel using, first
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> and afterwards the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and his Son,
besides his un-exampled Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against some of his Wives; and that which
was worst of all, The lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Precedent for the subversion of Iustice, and
oppressing the clearest Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, by attaining men without hearing them:
These are such remarkable blemishes, that as no man of ingenuity can go about
the whitening them; so the poor Reformers drunk so deep of that bitter cup,
that it very ill becomes any of their followers, to endeavour to give fair
Colours to those red and bloody Characters, with which so much of his Reign is
stained.</p>
            <p>Yet after all this sad enumeration, it was no new nor unusual
thing in the methods of Gods Providence, to employ Princes who had great
mixtures of very gross faults, to do signal things for his Service. Not to
mention <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> whose sins were expiated with a
severe Repentance; it was the bloody <hi>Cyrus</hi> that sent back the Iews to
their Land, and gave them leave to re-build their Temple. <hi>Constantine</hi>
the Great is by some of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, charged with many blemishes both in his
Life, and Government. <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> under whom that
Nation received the Christian Faith, was a monster of Cruelty and
Perfidiousness, as even <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents him, who
lived near his time, and nevertheless makes a Saint of him. <hi>Charles</hi>
the Great; whom some also make a Saint, both put away his wife for a very
slight cause, and is said to have lived in most unnatural lusts with his own
Daughter. <hi>Irene</hi> whom the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> magnifies, as the
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storer of their Religion in the East, did both contrary to the Impressions
of Nature, and of her Sex, put out her own Sons eyes, of which he died soon
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with many other execrable things. And whatever Reproaches those of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cast on the Reformation, upon the account of this Kings
faults, may be easily turned back on their Popes, who have never failed to
court and extol Princes that served their ends, how gross and scandalous soever
their other faults have been. As <hi>Phocas, Brunichild, Irene, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thildis,
Edgar</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and many more. But our Church is not near so
much concerned in the persons of those Princes, under whom the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
began, as theirs is in the persons of their Popes, who are believed to have far
higher Characters of a Divine Power and Spirit in them, than other Princes
pretend to. And yet if the lives of those Popes, who have made the greatest
advances in their Iurisdiction be examined, particularly <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Seventh, and <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, vices more eminent, than any can be
charged on King <hi>Henry,</hi> will be found in them. And if a leud and wicked
Pope may yet have the holy Ghost dwelling in him, and directing him infallibly;
why may not an ill King do so good a Work as set a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation forward, And if
it were proper to enter into a dissection of Four of those Popes, that sate at
<hi>Rome</hi> during this Reign, Pope <hi>Julius</hi> will be found beyond him
in a vast Ambition, whose bloody Reign did not only embroil <hi>Italy,</hi> but
a great part of Christendome. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth was as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
and prodigal in his expence, which put him on baser Shifts, than ever this King
used, to raise money; not by embasing the Coin, or raising new and heavie
taxes, but by embasing the Christian Religion, and prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting the pardon of
sin in that foul trade of Indulgences. <hi>Clement</hi> the <pb facs="tcp:104314:10"/>
Seventh was false to the highest degree; a vice which cannot be charged on this
King. And <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>3</hi>d. was a vile and lewd Priest, who not
only kept his whore, but gloried in it, and raised one of his Bastards to an
high Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, making him Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza;</hi> and
himself is said to have lived in Incest with others of them. And except the
short Reign of <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Sixth, there was no Pope at <hi>Rome</hi>
all this while, whose exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might make any other Prince blush for his
faults; so that <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> when he calls Pope <hi>Clement</hi> a
good Pope, adds, <hi>I mean not Goodness A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical, for in those days he was
esteemed a good Pope, that did not exceed the wickedness of the worst of
men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In sum, Gods ways are a great deep, who has often shewed his Power
and Wisdom, in raising up unlikely and unpromising instruments, to do great
services in the World; not always employing the best men in them, lest good
Instruments should share too deep in the Praises of that, which is only due to
the Supreme Creator and Governour of the World. And therefore he will <hi>stain
the pride of all Glory,</hi> that <hi>such as Glory may only Glory in the Lord.
Jehu</hi> did an acceptable Service to God, in destroying the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of
<hi>Baal,</hi> though neither the way of doing it be to be imitated, being
grosly insincere, nor was the Reformation compleat, since the Worshipping the
two Calves was still kept up; and it is very like, his chief design in it, was
to destroy all the Party that favoured <hi>Ahab's</hi> Family; yet the thing
was good and was rewarded by God: So whatever this Kings other faults were, and
how defective soever the Change he made was, and upon what ill motives soever
it may seem to have proceeded; yet the things themselves being good, we ought
not to think the worse of them because of the Instrument, or manner by which
they were wrought; but are to adore and admire the paths of the Divine Wisdom,
that brought about such a Change, in a Church, which being subjected to the See
of <hi>Rome,</hi> had been more than any other part of <hi>Europe</hi> most
tame under its Oppressions, and was most deeply drenched in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition: And
this by the means of a Prince, who was the most devoted to the Interest of
<hi>Rome</hi> of any in Christendome, and seemed to be so up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on knowledg, being
very learned; and continued to the last much leavened with Superstition, and
was the only King in the World whom that See de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>Defender of the
Faith.</hi> And that this should have been carried on so far, with so little
Opposition, some risings though numerous and formidable being scattered and
quieted without Blood; And that a mighty Prince, who was Victorious almost in
all his undertakings, <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5</hi>th. and was both provoked
in point of Honour and Interest, yet could never find one spare sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to turn
his Arms upon <hi>England,</hi> are great Demonstrations of a particular
Influence of Heaven in these Alterations, and of its watchful care of them.</p>
            <p>But the other prejudice touches the Reformation in a more vital
and tender part; and it is, That <hi>Cranmer</hi> and the other Bishops, who
promoted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in the Succeeding Reign, did in this comply too
servilly with King <hi>Henry's</hi> humours, both in carrying on his frequent
Divorces, and in retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Corruptions in the worship, which by their
throwing them off in the beginning of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, we may
conclude were then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by them; so that they seem to have praevaricated
against their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences in that Complyance.</p>
            <p>It were too faint a way of Answering so severe a Charge, to turn
it back on the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to shew the base Compliances of
some, even of the best of their Popes, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, whose
Congratulations to <pb facs="tcp:104314:11"/> the Usurper <hi>Phocas,</hi> are a strain of
the meanest, and undecentest flattery that ever was put in writing. And his
Complements to <hi>Brunichild,</hi> who was one of the greatest Monsters both
for Lust and Cruelty that ever her Sex produced, show that there was no person
so wicked that he was ashamed to flatter: but the blemishing them will not (I
confess) excuse our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, therefore other things are to be considered for
their Vindication. They did not at once attain the full knowledg of divine
Truth, so that in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as in that of the Corporal Presence in the
Sacrament, both <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> were themselves then in
the dark. <hi>Bertram's</hi> Book first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced <hi>Ridley,</hi> and he was
the chief instrument in opening <hi>Cranmer's</hi> eyes; So if themselves were
not then enlightned, they could not instruct others. As for other things, such
as the giving the Cup to the Laity, the Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in a known tongue, and
several reformations about the Mass, though they judged them necessary to be
done as soon as was possible; yet they had not so full a perswasion of the
necessity of these, as to think it a sin not to do them. The Prophets words to
<hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> might give them some colour for that
mistake, and the practice of the Apostles, who continued not only to worship at
the Temple, but to Circumcise and to offer Sacrifices (which must have been
done by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he purified himself in the Temple) even after
the Law was dead, by the appearing of the Gospel, seemed to excuse their
Compliance. They had also observed, that as the Apostles were <hi>all things to
all men, that so they might gain some;</hi> so the Primitive Christians had
brought in many rites of Heathenism into their worship: Upon which induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they were wrought on to comply in some uneasie things, in which if these
excuses do not wholly clear them, yet they very much lessen their Guilt.</p>
            <p>And after all this, it must be Confessed they were men, and had
mixtures of fear and human infirmities with their other excellent Qualities.
And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Cranmer</hi> was in all other points so extraordinary a person,
that it was perhaps fit, there should be some ingredients in his Temper, to
lessen the Veneration, which his great worth might have raised too high, if it
had not been for these feeblenesses, which upon some occasions appeared in him.
But if we examine the failings of some of the greatest of the Primitive
Fathers, as <hi>Athanasius, Cyril,</hi> and others, who were the most zealous
asserters of the Faith, we must conclude them to have been nothing inferiour to
any that can be charged on <hi>Cranmer;</hi> whom if we consider narrowly, we
shall find as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent vertues, and as few faults in him, as in any Prelate
that has been in the Christian Church for many Ages. And if he was prevailed on
to deny his Master through fear, he did wash off that stain by a sincere
Repentance and a patient Martyrdome, in which he expressed an eminent
resentment of his former frailty, with a pitch of Constancy of mind above the
rate of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Examples.</p>
            <p>But their vertues as well as their faults are set before us for
our instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and how frail soever the vessels were, they have conveyed to
us a treasure of great value, <hi>The pure Gospel of our Lord and Saviour:</hi>
which if we follow, and govern our lives and hearts by it, we may hope in
easier and plainer paths to attain that Blessedness, which they could not reach
but through scorching flames: and if we do not improve the Advantages, which
this light affords, we may either look for some of those trials, which were
sent for the exercise of their Faith and Patience, and perhaps for the
punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their former Compliance; or if we escape these, we have cause to
fear worse in the Conclusion.</p>

and cruel War between the Two Houses of <hi>York</hi> and
<hi>Lancaster</hi>;<note place="margin">King <hi>Henry's</hi> Succession to the
  Crown, <hi>Apr.</hi> 22. 1509.</note> during which time as the Crown had lost
great Dominions beyond Sea, so the Nation was much impoverished, many Noble
Families extinguisht, much Blood shed, great Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities every-where raised,
with all the other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of a lasting Civil War: But they now saw all these
happily composed, when the Two Families did unite in King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth. In his Fathers Reign they were rather cemented and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than united;
whose great Partiality to the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> from which he was
Descended, and Severity to the Branches of the House of <hi>York,</hi> in which
even his own Queen had a large share, together with the Impostors that were set
up to disturb his Reign, kept these heats alive, which were now all buried in
his grave: and this made the Succession of his Son so universally acceptable to
the whole Nation, who now hoped to revive their former pretensions in
<hi>France,</hi> and to have again a large share in all the Affairs of
<hi>Europe,</hi> from which their Domestick Broils had so long excluded
them.</p>
            <p>There was another thing,<note place="margin">He proceeds against

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> which made his first coming to
the Crown no less acceptable, which was, that the same day that his

                  <p>L. <hi>Herbert</hi> says the day following.</p>
               </note> he
ordered <hi>Dudley</hi> and <hi>Empson</hi> to be committed to the Tower: His
Father, whether out of Policy, or Inclination, or both, was all his life much
set on the gathering of Treasure, so that those Ministers were most acceptable,
who could fill his Coffers best: and though this occasioned some Tumults, and
disposed the People to all those Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which fell out in his Reign; yet
he being successful in them all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his course of heaping up
Money.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of his Life, he found out those Two Instruments,
who out-did all that went before them, and what by vexatious Suits upon Penal
but obsolete Laws, what by unjust Imprisonments, and other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and illegal
proceedings, raised a general <hi>odium</hi> upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this
grew upon him with his years, and was come to so great a height towards the end
of his Life, that he died in good time for his own quiet: For as he used all
possible endeavours to get Money, so what he got, he as carefully kept, and
distributed very little of it among those about him, so that he had many
Enemies, and but few Friends. This being well considered by his Son, he began
his Government with the disgrace of those Two Ministers, against whom he
proceeded according to Law; all the other inferiour Officers whom they had made
use of were also Imprisoned.</p>
            <p>When they had thus fallen, many and great Complaints came in from
all parts against them; they also apprehending the danger they were like to be
in upon their Masters Death, had been practising with their Partners to gather
about them all the Power they could bring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whether to secure
themselves from popular Rage, or to make themselves seem considerable, or
formidable to the new King. This and other Crimes being brought in against
them, they were found guilty of Treason in a legal Trial. But the King judged
this was neither a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reparation to his Oppressed People, nor
Satisfaction to Justice: Therefore he went further,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </note> and both ordered Restitution to be made by
his Fathers Executors of great Sums of Money, which had been unjustly extorted
from his Subjects; and in his first Parliament which he Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to the Twenty
first of <hi>Ianuary</hi> following,<note place="margin">He holds a Parliament
  <hi>Ian.</hi> 21. 1510.</note> he not only delivered up <hi>Empson</hi> and
<hi>Dudley</hi> with their Complices to the Justice of the Two Houses, who
attainted them by Act of Parliament, and a little after gave order for
<hi>their Execution</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 18.</note> but did
also give his Royal assent to those other Laws by which the Subject was secured
from the like Oppressions for the future: and that he might not at all be
suspected of any such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations as his Father had to amass Treasure, he was
the most mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in his Expence of any Prince in Christendom, and very
boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to all about him; and as one extreme commonly produces ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so
his Fathers Covetousness led him to be Prodigal, and the vast Wealth which was
left him,<note place="margin">His great Expence.</note> being reckoned no less
then 1800000 <hi>l.</hi> was in Three years dissipated, as if the Son in his
expence had vied Industry with his Father in all his Thrift.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> (afterwards Duke of
<hi>Norfolk</hi>) to shew how compliant he was to the Humours of the Princes
whom he served, as he had been Lord-Treasurer to the Father the last Seven
years of his Life; so being continued in the same Office by this King, did as
dextrously comply with his Prodigality, as he had done formerly with his
Fathers sparingness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:104314:13"/>But this in the beginning of the Princes Reign
did much endear him both to the Court and Nation: there being a freer
Circulation of Money by which Trade was encouraged; and the Courtiers tasted so
liberally of the Kings bounty, that he was every-where much magnified, though
his Expence proved afterwards heavier to the Subject, than ever his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Avarice had been.</p>
            <p>Another thing that raised the Credit of this King was,<note place="margin">His Affairs beyond Sea.</note> the great Esteem he was in beyond
Sea, both for his Wisdom and Power; so that in all the Treaties of Peace and
War he was always much considered; and he did so exactly pursue that great
Maxime of Princes, of <hi>Holding the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,</hi> that still as it grew
heavier, whether in the Scale of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> he
governed Himself and Them as a wise <hi>Arbiter.</hi> His first Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was
against <hi>France,</hi> which by the Accession of the Dutchy of
<hi>Britain,</hi> through his Father's over-sight, was made greater and more
formidable to the Neighbouring Princes; therefore the <hi>French</hi> Successes
in <hi>Italy</hi> having United all the Princes there against them,
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> willingly joyned themselves in the Quarrel.
The Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also then United, conquered
<hi>Navarre,</hi> which set them at great ease,<note place="margin">A War with
  <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> and weakned the King of <hi>France</hi> on that side.
Whose Affairs also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining in <hi>Italy,</hi> this King finding him so much
lessened, made Peace with him; having first managed his share of the War, with
great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at Sea and Land: For, going over in Person, he did both defeat
the <hi>French</hi> Army, and take <hi>Terwin</hi> and <hi>Tourney</hi>; the
former he demolished,<note place="margin">

Honour done him, which though it was a slight thing, yet was very pleasant to
him; <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour taking pay in his Army, amounting to a
Hundred Crowns a-day, and upon all publick Solemnities giving the King the
precedence.</p>
            <p>The Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> was made
firmer by <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Marrying <hi>Mary</hi> the

               </note> new
Counsels were to be taken. <hi>Francis,</hi> who succeeded, did in the
beginning of his Reign, court this King with great Offers to renew the Peace
with him, which was accordingly done. Afterward <hi>Francis</hi> falling in
with all his force upon the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> all endeavours were used
to engage King <hi>Henry</hi> into the War, both by the Pope and Emperour, this
last feeding him long with hopes of resigning the Empire to him, which wrought
much on him; insomuch that he did give them a great Supply in Money, but he
could not be engaged to divert <hi>Francis</hi> by making War upon him: and

him into a straiter League, and a Match was agreed between the <hi>Dolphin</hi>
and the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> the Kings Daughter, and <hi>Tourney</hi> was
delivered up to the <hi>French</hi> again.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Charles,</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria</hi> by his
Father, and Heir to the House of <hi>Burgundy</hi> by his Grand-mother, and to

               <hi>Francis</hi> and He were Corrivals for the Empire: but <hi>Charles</hi>
being preferred in the Competition, there followed, what through personal
Animosities, what through reason of State, and a desire of Conquest, lasting
Wars between them; which though they were sometimes for a while closed up, yet
were never <pb n="4" facs="tcp:104314:14"/> clearly ended. And those two great Monarchs as
they eclipsed most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes about them, so they raised this Kings glory
higher, both courting him by turns, and that not only by earnest and warm

People.<note place="margin">1520.</note> In the year 1520. there was an Interview
agreed on between the <hi>French</hi> King and Him; but the Emperor, to
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the effects he feared from it, resolved to out doe the <hi>French</hi>
King in the Complement, and without any Treaty or previous assurances came to

advance his design gained Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> who then Governed all the
Kings Counsels, by the promise of making him Pope; in which he judged he might,
for a present Advantage, promise a thing that seemed to be at so great a
distance, (Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth being then but a young man) and with
rich presents, which he made both to the King, the Cardinal and all the Court,
wrought much on them. But that which prevailed most with the King was, that he
saw, though <hi>Charles</hi> had great Dominions, yet they lay at such a
distance, that <hi>France</hi> alone was a sufficient Counterpoise to him; but
if <hi>Francis</hi> could keep <hi>Milan,</hi> recover <hi>Naples,
Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> to all which he was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, he
would be an uneasie Neighbour to himself; and if he kept the footing he then
had in <hi>Italy,</hi> he would lie so heavy on the Papacy, that the Popes
could no longer carry equally in the affairs of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, upon which much
depended, according to the Religion of that time. Therefore he resolved to take
part with the Emperor, till at least <hi>Francis</hi> was driven out of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and reduced to juster terms: so that the following Interview

            <p>The Cardinal finding the publick Interests concur so happily with
his private Distastes, engaged the King to take part with <hi>France,</hi> and
afterwards with the Pope against the Emperor, his Greatness now becoming the
Terror of Christendome; for the Emperor lifted up with his success, began to
think of no less than an Universal Empire. And first, that he might unite all
<hi>Spain</hi> together, he preferred a Match with <hi>Portugal,</hi> to that
which he had before Contracted in <hi>England</hi>; and he thought it not
enough to break off his sworn Alliance with the King, but he did it with an
heavy Imputation on the Lady <hi>Mary</hi>: for in his Council it was said that
she was illegitimate, as being born in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Marriage, so that no
Advantage could be expected from her Title to the Succession, as will appear
more particularly in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book. And the Pope having dispensed with the
Oath, he Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Besides, though
the King of <hi>England</hi> had gone deep in the Charge, he would give him no
share in the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the War; much less give him that Assistance which
he had promised him, to recover his Ancient Inheritance in <hi>France.</hi> The
King being irritated with this manifold ill usage, and led on by his own
Interests, and by the offended Cardinal, joyned himself to the Interests of
<hi>France.</hi> Upon which there followed not only a firm Alliance, but a
personal Friendship, which appeared in all the most obliging expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that
could be devised. And upon the Kings threatning to make War on the Emperor, the
<hi>French</hi> King was set at liberty, though on very hard terms,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 18. 1526.</note> if any thing can be hard that sets
a King out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but he still acknowledged he owed his Liberty to King
<hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then followed the famous <hi>Clementine League</hi> between the
Pope and <hi>Francis,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The
  <hi>Clementine</hi> League. <hi>May.</hi> 22. 1526.</note> the
<hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> by
which the Pope absolved the <hi>French</hi> King from the Oath he had sworn at
<hi>Madrid,</hi> and they all united against the Emperor, and declared the King
of <hi>England Protector of the League.</hi> This gave the Emperor great
distaste, who complained of the Pope as an ungrateful and perfidious person.
The first beginning of the storm fell hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy on the Pope; for the
<hi>French</hi> King, who had a great mind to have his Children again into his
own hands, that lay Hostages in <hi>Spain,</hi> went on but slowly in
performing his part. And the King of <hi>England</hi> would not openly break
with the Emperor, but seemed to reserve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be Arbiter between the
Princes. So that the <hi>Colonna's</hi> being of the Imperial Faction, with
3000 men entered <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Castle of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104314:15"/> to make peace with the
Emperor. But as soon as that fear was over, the Pope returning to his old arts,
complained of the Cardinal of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna,</hi> and resolved to deprive him of
that Dignity, and with an Army entred the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> taking
divers places that belonged to that Family. But the Confederates coming slowly
to his Assistance, and he hearing of great forces that were coming from
<hi>Spain</hi> against him, submitted himself to the Emperor, and made a
Cessation of Arms; but being again encouraged with some hopes from his Allies,
and (by a Creation of 14 Cardinals for Money,<note place="margin">1527.</note>)
having raised 300000 Duckats he disowned the Treaty, and gave the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples</hi> to Count <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> whom he sent with forces to subdue
it. But the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> prevented him, and went to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and giving the Assault, in which himself received his mortal wound, the City
was taken by Storm, and plundered for several days,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rome</hi> taken and sack't <hi>May</hi> 16.</note> about 5000
being killed. The Pope with 17 Cardinals fled to the Castle St.
<hi>Angelo,</hi> but was forced to render his person, and to pay 400000 Duckats
to the Army.</p>
            <p>This gave great offence to all the Princes of Christendome, except
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi>; but none resented it more loudly
than this King,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iuly</hi> 11.</note> who sent over
Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> to make up a new Treaty with <hi>Francis,</hi> which
was chiefly intended for setting the Pope at Liberty. Nor did the Emperor know
well how to justifie an Action which seemed so inconsistent with his Devotion
to the See of <hi>Rome</hi>; yet the Pope was for some months detained a
Prisoner, till at length the Emperor having brought him to his own terms,
ordered him to be setat liberty: but he being weary of his Guards escaped in a
disguise, and owned his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to have flowed chiefly from the Kings
endeavours to procure it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Decemb.</hi> 9.</note> And thus
stood the King as to forreign affairs: he had infinitely obliged both the Pope
and the <hi>French</hi> King, and was firmly united to them, and engaged in a
War against the Emperor, when he began first to move about his Divorce.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Scotland,</hi> the near Alliance between him and
<hi>Iames</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The
  Kings success against <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> did not take away the standing
Animosities between the two Nations, nor interrupt the Alliance between
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> And therefore when he made the first War
upon <hi>France</hi> in the Fourth year of his Reign, the King of
<hi>Scotland</hi> came with a great Army into the North of <hi>England,</hi>
but was totally defeated by the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> in <hi>Floudon</hi>
field.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sept.</hi> 9. 1513.</note> The King himself was
either killed in the Battel, or soon after; so that the Kingdom falling under
Factions, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Minority of the new King, the Government was but feeble,
and scarce able to secure its own quiet. And the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> the
chief Instrument of the <hi>French</hi> Faction, met with such opposition from
the Parties that were raised against him by King <hi>Henry's</hi> means, that
he could give him no disturbance. And when there came to be a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting peace
between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> then, as the King needed fear no
trouble from that Warlike Nation, so he got a great Interest in the Government
there. And at this time Money becoming a more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Engine than any the
War had ever produced, and the discovery of the <hi>Indies</hi> having brought
great wealth into <hi>Europe,</hi> Princes began to deal more in that trade
than before: so that both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> had their
Instruments in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and gave considerable yearly Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the
chief heads of Parties and Families. In the search I have <pb n="7" facs="tcp:104314:15"/>
made, I have found several Warrants for Sums of Money, to be sent into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and divided there among the Favourers of the
<hi>English</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; and 'tis not to be doubted but <hi>France</hi>
traded in the same manner, which continued till a happier way was found out for
extinguishing these Quarrels, both the Crowns being set on one head.</p>
            <p>Having thus shewed the State of this Kings Government as to
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Matters,<note place="margin">His Counsels at home.</note> I shall next
give an account of the Administration of Affairs at home, both as to Civil and
Spiritual Matters. The King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his first coming to the Crown did choose a
wise Council, partly out of those whom his Father had trusted, partly out of
those that were recommended to him by his Grand-Mother, the Countess of
<hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Derby,</hi> in whom was the Right of the House of
<hi>Lancaster,</hi> though she willingly devolved her pretensions on her Son,
claiming no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to her self, but the Satisfaction of being Mother to a King.
She was a wise and Religious Woman,<note place="margin">1509.</note> and died
soon after her Grand-Son came to the Crown. There was a Faction in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
between <hi>Fox</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and the Lord Treasurer,
which could never be well made up, though they were oft reconciled:
<hi>Fox</hi> always complaining of the Lord Treasurer, for squandring away so
soon that vast Mass of Treasure, left by the Kings Father in which the other
justified himself, that what he did, was by the Kings Warrants which he could
not disobey: but <hi>Fox</hi> objected that he was too easie to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, if not
to procure these Warrants, and that he ought to have given the King better
advice.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ian.</hi> 21. 1510.</note> In the Kings first
Parliament things went as he desired upon his delivering up <hi>Empson</hi> and
<hi>Dudley,</hi> in which his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the severity of the Houses, and
proceeding against them at the Common Law, as it secured his Ministers from an
unwelcome Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, so the whole honour of it fell on the Kings justice.</p>
            <p>His next Parliament was in the Third year of his Reign,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Feb.</hi>
  4. 1512.</note> and there was considered the <hi>Brief</hi> from Pope
<hi>Iulius</hi> the Second to the King, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the Indignities and
Injuries done to the Apostolick See and the Pope by the <hi>French</hi> King,
and entreating the Kings assistance with such cajoling words as are always to
be expected from Popes on the like occasions. It was first read by the Master
of the Rolls in the House of Lords, and then the Lord Chancellour
(<hi>Warham</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) and the Lord Treasurer,
with other Lords, went down to the House of Commons and read it there. Upon
this and other reasons they gave the King subsidies towards the War with
<hi>France.</hi> At this time <hi>Fox,</hi> to strengthen his Party against the
Lord Treasurer, finding <hi>Thomas Wolsey</hi> to be a likely man to get into
the Kings favour,<note place="margin">Cardinal <hi>Wolseys</hi> rising.</note>
used all his endeavours to raise him, who was at that time neither unknown nor
inconsiderable, being Lord Almoner; he was at first made a Privy Counsellour,
and frequently admitted to the Kings presence, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him over to
<hi>France.</hi> The King liked him well, which he so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged that he quickly
engrossed the Kings favour to himself, and for 15 years together was the most
absolute Favourite that had ever been seen in <hi>England</hi>; all forreign
Treaties and Places of Trust at home were at his Ordering; he did what he
pleased, and his Ascendant over the King was such, that there never appeared
any Party against him all that while. The great Artifice by which he insinuated
himself so much on the King, is set down very plainly by one that knew him
well, in <pb n="8" facs="tcp:104314:16"/> these words. <hi>In him the King conceived such a
loving fancy, especially for that he was most earnest and readiest in all the
Counsel to advance the Kings only will and pleasure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cavendish life of <hi>Wolsey</hi> MSS. <hi>in Bibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth. Nob.</hi>
  D.G. Pierpoint.</note> 
               <hi>having no respect to the case; and whereas the
Ancient Counsellors would according to the Office of good Counsellors, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times perswade the King to have some time a recourse unto the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, there
to hear what was done in weighty Matters, the King was nothing at all pleased
therewith; for he loved nothing worse than to be constrained to do any thing
contrary to his pleasure, and that knew the</hi> Almoner <hi>very well, having
secret Insinuations of the Kings Intentions; and so fast as the others
Counselled the King to leave his pleasures, and to attend to his Affairs, so
busily did the</hi> Almoner <hi>perswade him to the contrary, which delighted
him much, and caused him to have the greater affection and love to the</hi>
Almoner. Having got into such Power, he observed the Kings Inclinations
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, and followed his Interests closely: for though he made other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
retain him with great Presents and Pensions, yet he never engaged the King into
any Alliance, but what was for his Advantage. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at home, after he
was established in his Greatness, he affected to Govern without Parliaments,
there being from the Seventh year of his Reign, after which he got the great
Seal, but one Parliament in the 14th and 15th year, and no more till the One
and Twentieth, when matters were turning about: But he raised great Sums of
Money by Loans and Benevolences. And indeed if we look on him as a Minister of
State, he was a very extraordinary Person; but as he was a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he was
the disgrace of his Profession. He not only served the King in all his secret
pleasures, but was lewd and vicious himself; so that his having the <hi>French
Pox</hi> (which in those days was a matter of no small infamy) was so publick,
that it was brought against him in Parliament when he fell in disgrace: he was
a man of most extravagant vanity, as appears by the great State he lived in;
and to feed that, his Ambition and Covetousness were proportionable.</p>

his own hands, the King granted him a full Power of disposing of all the
Ecclesiastical benefices in <hi>England</hi> (which brought him in as much
money as all the Places he held) for having so vast a Power committed to him
both from the King and the Pope as to Church-preferments, it may be easily
gathered what advantages a man of his temper would draw from it.
<hi>Warham</hi> was Lord Chancellour the first seven years of the Kings Reign,
but retired to give place to this aspir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favourite, who had a mind to the
great Seal, that there might be no interfering between the Legantine and
Chancery Courts. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it wrought somewhat on his vanity, that even
after he was Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, <hi>Warham</hi> as Lord Chancellour took place of him,
as appears from the Entries made in the Journals of the House of Peers in the
Parliament <pb facs="tcp:104314:16"/> held the 7th year of the Kings Reign, and afterwards
gave him place, as appears on many occasions, particularly, in the Letter
written to the Pope 1530 set down by the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> which the
Cardinal subscribed before <hi>Warham.</hi> We have nothing on record to shew
what a Speaker he was, for all the Journals of Parliament from the 7th to the
25th year of this King are lost, but it is like he spoke as his Predecessor in
that Office <hi>Warham</hi> did, whose speeches as they are entred in the
Journals, are Sermons begun with a Text of Scripture; which he expounded and
applyed to the business they were to go upon, stuffing them with the most
fulsome flattery of the King that was possible.</p>
            <p>The next in favour and Power was the Lord Treasurer restored to
his Fathers honour of Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to whom his Son succeeded in
that Office as well as in his hereditary honours; and managed his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
with the King so dexterously that he stood in all the Changes that followed,
and continued Lord Treasurer during the Reign of this King, till near the end
of it, when he fell through Jealousie rather than guilt; this shewed how
dexterous a man he was, that could stand so long in that imployment under such
a King.</p>
            <p>But the chief Favourite in the Kings pleasures, was <hi>Charles

            <p>As for his Parliaments, he took great care to keep a good
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <pb n="10" facs="tcp:104314:17"/> with them, and chiefly with the House of
Commons, by which means he seldom failed to carry Matters as he pleased among
them: only in the Parliament held in the 14th and 15th of his Reign, the Demand
of the Subsidy towards the War with <hi>France,</hi> being so high as 800000
lib. the 5th of mens goods and lands to be paid in Four years, and the Cardinal
being much hated, there was great Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to it: for which the
Cardinal blamed Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> much, who was then Speaker of the
House of Commons; and finding that which was offered, was not above the half of
what was asked, went himself to the House of Commons, and desired to hear the
reasons of those who opposed his Demands, that he might answer them: but he was
told the Order of their House was to reason only among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so went
away much dissatisfied. It was with great difficulty that they obtained a
Subsidy of 3 <hi>s.</hi> in the lib. to be paid in four years. This
disappointment it seems did so offend the Cardinal, that as no Parliament had
been called for Seven years before, so there was none summoned for Seven years
after. And thus stood the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> in the 19th
year of the Kings Reign, when the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Divorce was first moved. But I

than had been usually bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Education of Princes for many Ages, who
had been only trained up to those Exercises that prepared them to War; and if
they could read and write, more was not expected of them. But learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing began
now to flourish; and as the House of <hi>Medici</hi> in <hi>Florence</hi> had
great honour by the Protection it gave to learned men, so other Princes
every-where cherished the Muses. King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, though illiterate
himself, yet took care to have his Children instructed in good letters. And it
generally passes current that he bred his second Son a Scholar, having designed
him to be Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but that has no foundation; for
the Writers of that time tell, that his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>
was also bred a Scholar. And all the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction King <hi>Henry</hi> had in
Learning, must have been after his Brother was dead, when that Design had
vanished with his life. For he being born the 18th of <hi>Iune</hi> 1491. and
Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> dying the Second of <hi>April</hi> 1502. he was not full
eleven years of Age, when he became Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>; at which Age
Princes have seldom made any great progress in Learning. But King
<hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, judging either that it would make his Sons Greater
Princes, and fitter for the Management of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, or being jealous of
their looking too early into business, or their pretending to the Crown upon
their Mothers Title, which might have been a dangerous competition to him, that
was so little beloved by his Subjects, took this Method for amusing them with
other things: thence it was, that his Son was the most learned Prince that had
been in the World for many Ages, and deserved the Title <hi>Beau-Clerke,</hi>
on a better account than his Predecessor that long before had carried it. The
Learning then in credit, was either that of the Schools, about abstruse
Questions of Divinity, which from the days of <hi>Lombard</hi> were debated and
descanted on with much subtlety and nicety, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all Speculative
Divines; or the Study of the Canon-Law, which was the way to Business and
Preferment. To the former of these the <pb facs="tcp:104314:17"/> King was much addicted,
and delighted to read often in <hi>Thomas
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </hi>; and this made Cardinal
<hi>Wolsey</hi> more acceptable to him, who was

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> conversant in that sort of

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it, and to <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi>; though neither of these
made their Court dextrously with the Cardinal, which did much intercept the
King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to them; so that the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used in it, who has sufficiently
revenged himself upon the Cardinal's Memory. The Philosophy then in fashion was
so intermixed with their Divinity, that the King understood it too; and was
also a good Musician, as appears by two whole Masses which he composed. He
never wrote well, but scrawled so that his hand was scarce legible.</p>
            <p>Being thus inclined to Learning, he was much courted by all hungry
Scholars, who generally over <hi>Europe</hi> dedicated their Books to him, with
such flattering Epistles, that it very much lessens him, to see how he
delighted in such stuffe. For if he had not taken pleasure in it, and rewarded
them, it is not likely that others should have been every year writing after
such ill Copies. Of all things in the World Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery wrought most on him; and
no sort of Flattery pleased him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to have his great Learning and
Wisdom commended. And in this, his Parliaments, his Courtiers, his Chaplains,
Forreigners and Natives, all seemed to vie who should exceed most, and came to
speak to him in a Stile which was scarce fit to be used to any Creature. But he
designed to entail these praises on his Memory, cherishing Church-men more than
any King in <hi>England</hi> had ever done; he also Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Pope with a
constant submission, and upon all occasions made the Popes Interests his own,
and made War and Peace as they desired him. So that had he dyed any time before
the 19th year of his Reign, he could scarce have scaped being Canonized,
notwithstanding all his faults; for he abounded in those vertues, which had
given Saintship to Kings for near 1000 years together, and had done more than
they all did, by writing a Book for the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> had for above 300 years been the tamest part of
Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the Papal Authority, and had been accordingly dealt with.<note place="margin">The Kings Prerogative in Ecclesiastical matters.</note> But though
the Parliaments and two or three high-spirited Kings, had given some
interruption to the cruel exactions and other illegal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Court

even in this Kings days, the Crown was not quite stript of all its Authority
over Spiritual persons. The Investitures of Bishops and Abbots, which had been
originally given by the delivery of the Pastoral Ring and Staffe, by the Kings
of <hi>England,</hi> were after some opposition wrung out of their hands: yet I
find they retained another thing, which upon the matter was the same. When any
See was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, a Writ was issued out of the Chancery for seizing on all the
Temporalties of the Bishoprick,<note place="margin">

               </note> and then the King
recommended one to the Pope, upon which his Bulls were expeded at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and so by a Warrant from the Pope he was consecrated, and
invested in the Spiritualties of the See; but was to appear before the King
either in Person or by Proxie, and renounce every clause in his Letters and
Bulls, that were or might be prejudicial to the Prerogative of the Crown, or
contrary to the Laws of the Land, and was to swear Fealty <pb n="12" facs="tcp:104314:18"/>
and Allegiance to the King. And after this a new Writ was issued out of the
Chancery, bearing that this was done, and that thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Temporalties
should be restored.<note place="margin">

               </note> Of this there are so many Precedents in the

it the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will find in the Collection the fullest Record which I met with
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it in <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th his Reign, of Cardinal
<hi>Adrian's</hi> being Invested in the Bishoprick of <hi>Bath</hi> and
<hi>Wells.</hi> So that upon the matter the Kings then disposed of all
Bishopricks, keeping that still in their own hands which made them most desired
in those Ages; and so had the Bishops much at their Dovotion.</p>
            <p>But King <hi>Henry</hi> in a great degree parted with this, by the
above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned power granted to Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> who being Legate as
well as Lord Chancellour, it was thought a great errour in Government, to lodge
such a trust with him which might have past into a Precedent, for other Legates
pretending to the same Power; since the Papal great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had thus risen, and
oft upon weaker grounds, to the height it was then at. Yet the King had no mind
to suffer the Laws made against the suing out of Bulls in the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> without his leave to be neglected;<note place="margin">License to

            </p>
            <p>But the immunity of Ecclesiastical persons was a thing that
occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned great complaints. And good cause there was for them. For it was
ordinary for persons after the greatest Crimes to get into Orders; and then not
only what was past must be forgiven them, but they were not to be questioned
for any Crime after holy Orders given, till they were first degraded; and till
that was done they were the Bishops Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners. Whereupon there rose a great
dispute in the beginning of this Kings Reign, of which none of our Historians
having taken any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, I shall give a full account of it.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh in his Fourth Parliament did a
little lessen the Priviledges of the Clergy,<note place="margin"> 
                  <p>A Contest about the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticalIm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</p>

                     <hi>Killways</hi> Reports.</p>
               </note> enacting that Clerks
convicted should be burnt in the hand. But this not proving a sufficient
restraint, it was Enacted in Parliament in the Fourth year of this King, that
all Murderers and Robbers should be denyed the benefit of their Clergy. But
though this seemed a very Just Law, yet to make it pass through the House of
Lords, they added two Proviso's to it, the one for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting all such as were
within the Holy Orders of <hi>Bishop, Priest,</hi> or <hi>Deacon</hi>; the
other that the Act should only be in force till the next Parliament. With these
Proviso's it was unanimously assented to by the Lords on the 26 <hi>Ian.</hi>
1513. and being agreed to by the Commons, the Royal Assent made it a Law:
Pursuant to which many Murderers and Felons were denyed their Clergy, and the
Law passed on them to the great Satisfaction of the whole Nation. But this gave
great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Clergy, who had no mind to suffer their Immunities to be
touched or lessened. And judging that if the laity made bold with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Orders, they would proceed further even against Sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; therefore as
their Opposition was such that the Act not being continued did determine at the
next Parliament (that was in the 5th <pb n="13" facs="tcp:104314:18"/> year of the King,) so
they not satisfied with that, resolved to fix a censure on that Act as contrary
to the Franchises of the Holy Church. And the Abbot of <hi>Winchelcomb</hi>
being more forward than the rest, during the session of Parliament in the 7
year of this King's Reign, in a Sermon at <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross, said openly,
That that Act was <hi>contrary to the Law of God, and to the Liberties of the
Holy Church, and that all who assented to it, as well Spiritual as Temporal
Persons, had by so doing incur'd the Censures of the Church.</hi> And for
Confirmation of his Opinion, he published a Book to prove, That all Clerks,
whether of the greater or lower Orders, were Sacred, and exempted from all
Temporal Punishment by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judge, even in Criminal cases. This made
great noise, and all the Temporal Lords, with the concurrence of the House of
Commons, desired the King to suppress the growing Insolence of the Clergy. So
there was a hearing of the Matter before the King, with all the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and the
Kings Temporal Council. Doctor <hi>Standish</hi> Guardian of the Mendicant
Friers in <hi>London</hi> (afterwards Bishop of Saint <hi>Asaph</hi>) the chief
of the Kings Spiritual Council, argued, That by the Law, Clerks had been still
convened and judged in the Kings Court for Civil Crimes, and that there was
nothing either in the Laws of God, or the Church, inconsistent with it; and
that the publick good of the Society, which was chiefly driven at by all Laws,
and ought to be preferred to all other things, required that Crimes should be
punished. But the Abbot of <hi>Winchelcomb</hi> being Counsel for the Clergy,
excepted to this and said, <hi>There was a Decree made by the Church expresly
to the contrary, to which all ought to pay Obedience under the pain of Mortal
sin; and that therefore the trying of Clerks in the Civil Courts was a sin in
it self. Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> upon this turned to the King and said, <hi>God forbid
that all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Church should bind. It seems the Bishops think not
so, for though there is a Decree that they should reside at their Cathedrals
all the Festivals of the year, yet the greater part of them do it not</hi>;
Adding, That no Decree could have any force in <hi>England,</hi> till it was
received there; and That this Decree was never received in <hi>England,</hi>
but that as well since the making of it, as before, Clerks had been tryed for
Crimes in the Civil Courts. To this the Abbot made no answer, but brought a
place of Scripture to prove this Exemption to have come from our Saviours
words, <hi>Nolite tangere Christos meos,</hi> Touch not mine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed; and
therefore Princes ordering Clerks to be arrested and brought before their
Courts, was contrary to Scripture, against which no custome can take place.
<hi>Standish</hi> replyed, these words were never said by our Saviour, but were
put by <hi>David</hi> in his <hi>Psalter</hi> 1000 years before Christ; and he
said these words had no relation to the Civil Judicatories, but because the
greatest part of the World was then wicked, and but a small number believed the
Law, they were a Charge to the Rest of the World, not to do them harm. But
though the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot had been very violent, and confident of his being able to
confound all that held the contrary opinion, yet he made no answer to this. The
Laity that were present being confirmed in their former opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by hearing the
Matter thus argued, moved the Bishops to order the Abbot to renounce his former
opinion, and recant his Sermon at <hi>Pauls Cross.</hi> But they flatly refused
to do it, and said they were bound by the Laws of the Holy Church to maintain
the Abbots opinion in <pb n="12" facs="tcp:104314:19"/>

               </note> The Entrie is in

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell out, that made this matter be
more fully prosecuted in the <hi>Michaelmas-Term.</hi> One <hi>Richard
Hunne</hi> a Merchant-Taylor in <hi>London,</hi> was questioned by a Clerk in
<hi>Middlesex</hi> for a Mortuary, pretended to be due for a Child of his that
died 5 weeks old. The Clerk claiming the <hi>beering</hi> sheet, and
<hi>Hunne</hi> refusing to give it; upon that he was sued, but his Counsel
advised him to sue the Clerk in a <hi>Premunire,</hi> for bringing the Kings
Subjects before a forreign Court; the Spiritual Court sitting by Authority from
the Legate. This touched the Clergy so in the quick, that they used all the
Arts they could to fasten Heresie on him; and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had
<hi>Wickliff's</hi> Bible, upon that he was attached of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and put in the
<hi>Lollards</hi> Tower at <hi>Pauls,</hi> and examined upon some Articles
objected to him by <hi>Fitz-Iames</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London.</hi> He
denied them as they were charge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

against him, but acknowledged he had said some words sounding that way, for
which he was sorry, and asked Gods mercy, and submitted himself to the Bishops
Correction; upon which he ought to have been enjoyned Penance and set at
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but he persisting still in his Sute in the Kings Courts, they used
him most cruelly. On the Fourth of <hi>December</hi> he was found hanged in the
Chamber where he was kept

               </gap>hop of <hi>London,</hi> with the other Officers who had the Charge
of the Prison, gave it out that he had hang'd himself. But the Coroner of
<hi>London</hi> coming to hold an Inquest on the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they found him
hanging so loose, and in a silk girdle, that they clearly perceived he was
killed; they also found his Neck had been broken, as they judged, with an Iron
chain, for the Skin was all fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cut; they saw some streams of blood
about his body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides several other evidences which made it clear he had not
murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself; whereupon they did acquit the dead body, and laid the Murder
on the Officers that had the charge of that Prison: and by other proofs they
found the Bishops Sumner and the Bell-ringer guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, and by the
deposition of the Sumner himself it did appear, that the Chancellour and he,
and the Bell-ringer did Murder him, and then hang him up.</p>
            <p>But as the Inquest proceeded in this Trial, the Bishop began a new
Process against the dead body of <hi>Richard Hunne,</hi> for other points of
Heresie; and several Articles were gathered out of <hi>Wickliff's</hi> Preface
to the Bible with which he was charged. And his having the Book in his
Possession being taken for good evidence, he was judged an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, and his
body delivered to the Secular Power. When judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given, the Bishops of
<hi>Duresme</hi> and <hi>Lincoln</hi> with many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors both of Divinity and
the Canon-Law sate with the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>; so that it was lookt on
as an Act of the whole Clergy, <pb n="15" facs="tcp:104314:20"/> and done by common
consent.<note place="margin">And his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy burned <hi>Dec.</hi> 20. 1514.</note>
On the 20th of <hi>December</hi> his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was burnt at
<hi>Smithfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this produced an effect very different from what was expected,
for it was hoped that he being found an Heretick no body should appear for him
any more: whereas on the contrary, it occasioned a great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, the man
having lived in very good reputation among his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; so that after that
day the City of <hi>London</hi> was never well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Popish Clergy,
but inclined to follow any body who spoke against them, and every one lookt on
it, as a Cause of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. All exclaimed against the Cruelty of their
Clergy, that for a mans suing a Clerke according to law, he should be long and
hardly used in a severe imprisonment, and at last cruelly murdered; and all
this laid on himself to defame him, and ruin his family. And then to burn that
body which they had so handled, was thought such a complication of Cruelties,
as few Barbarians had ever been guilty of. The Bishop finding that the Inquest
went on, and the whole matter was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, used all possible endeavours to
stop their proceedings; and they were often brought before the Kings Council,
where it was pretended that all proceeded from Malice and Heresie. The Cardinal
laboured to procure an order to forbid their going any further, but the thing
was both so foul and so evident that it could not be done: and that opposition
made it more generally believed. In the Parliament there was a Bill sent up to
the Lords by the Commons for restoring <hi>Hunne's</hi> Children, which was
passed, and had the Royal assent to it; but another Bill being brought in about
this Murther it occasioned great heats among them. The Bishop of
<hi>London</hi> said that <hi>Hunne</hi> had hanged himself, that the Inquest
were false perjured Caitiffs, and if they proceeded further he could not keep
his house for Hereticks; so that the Bill which was sent up by the Commons was
but once read in the House of Lords,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>April</hi> 3.</note>
for the power of the Clergy was great there. But the Trial went on, and both
the Bishops Chancellour and the Summer were endicted as Principals in the
Murder.</p>
            <p>The Convocation that was then sitting, finding so great a stir
made, and that all their liberties were now struck at, resolved to call Doctor
<hi>Standish</hi> to an Account for what he had said and argued in that matter,
so he being summoned before them, some Articles were objected to him by word of
mouth, concerning the judging of Clerks in Civil Courts; and the day following
they being put in writing, the Bill was delivered to him, and a day assigned
for him to make answer. The Doctor perceiving their intention, and judging it
would go hard with him if he were tryed before them, went and claimed the Kings
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, from this trouble that he was now brought in, for discharging his
duty as the Kings Spiritual Counsel. But the Clergy made their excuse to the
King, that they were not to question him for any thing he had said as the Kings
Counsel; but for some Lectures he read at St <hi>Pauls</hi> and elswhere,
<hi>contrary to the Law of God, and Liberties of the holy Church which they
were bound to maintain</hi>; and desired the Kings Assistance accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his
<hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> and as he would not incur the Censures of the holy
Church. On the other hand the Temporal Lords and Judges, with the concurrence
of the House of Commons, addressed to the King, to maintain the Temporal
Jurisdiction according to his <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> 
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:104314:21"/>
and to protect <hi>Standish</hi> from the Malice of his enemies.</p>
            <p>This put the King in great perplexity, for he had no mind to lose
any part of his Temporal Jurisdiction, and on the other hand was no less
apprehensive of the dangerous effects that might follow on a breach with the
Clergy. So he called for Doctor <hi>Veysey,</hi> then Dean of his Chappel and
afterwards Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and charged him upon his Allegiance to
declare the truth to him in that matter: which after some study he did, and
said, upon his <hi>Faith, Conscience,</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> he did
think that the convening of Clerks before the secular Judg, which had been
always practised in <hi>England,</hi> might well consist with the Law of God
and the <hi>true Liberties of the holy Church.</hi> This gave the King great
satisfaction; so he commanded all the Judges, and his Council both Spiritual
and Temporal, and some of both Houses, to meet at <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> and to
hear the matter argued. The Bill against Doctor <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> was read,
which consisted of Six Articles that were objected to him. First, <hi>That he
had said that the lower Orders were not sacred.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That the
Exemption of Clerks was not founded on a divine Right.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That
the Laity might coerce Clerks when the Prelates did not their duty.</hi>
Fourthly, <hi>That no positive Ecclesiastical Law binds any but those who
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>That the Study of the Canon-Law was
needless.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>That of the whole Volume of the</hi> Decretum,
<hi>so much as a man could hold in his fist, and no more, did oblige
Christians.</hi> To these Doctor <hi>Standish</hi> answered, that for those
things exprest in the Third, the Fifth, and the Sixth Articles he had never
taught them; as for his asserting them at any time in discourse, as he did not
remember it, so he did not much care, whether he had done it or not. To the
First he said, <hi>Lesser Orders in one sense</hi> are <hi>sacred,</hi> and in
another they are <hi>not sacred.</hi> For the Second and Fourth, he confessed
he had taught them, and was ready to justifie them. It was objected by the
Clergy, that as by the Law of God, <hi>no man could judge his Father,</hi> it
being contrary to that Commandment, <hi>Honour thy Father</hi>: So Church-men
being <hi>Spiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> they could not be judged by the Laity who
were their <hi>Children.</hi> To which he answered, that as that only concluded
in favour of <hi>Priests,</hi> those in Inferiour Orders not being
<hi>Fathers</hi>; so it was a mistake to say a Judge might not sit upon his
Natural Father, for the Judge was by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Relation above his Natural
Father: and though the Commandment is conceived in general words, yet there are
some exceptions to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; as though it be said, <hi>Thou shalt not
kill,</hi> yet in some cases we may lawfully kill, so in the case of justice a
Judge may lawfully sit on his Father.</p>
            <p>But Doctor <hi>Veysey</hi>'s Argument was that which took most
with all that were present. He said, it was certain that the Laws of the Church
<hi>did not bind any but those who received them.</hi> To prove this, he said,
that in old times all secular Priests were Married; but in the days of St.
<hi>Augustine,</hi> the Apostle of <hi>England,</hi> there was a Decree made to
the contrary, which was received in <hi>England</hi> and in many other places,
by vertue whereof the Secular Priests in <hi>England</hi> may not Marry; but
this Law not being universally received, <hi>the Greek Church never judged
themselves bound by it,</hi> so that to this day the Priests in that Church
have Wives as well as other secular men. If then the Churches of the
<hi>East</hi> not having received the Law of the Celibate of the Clergy, have
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <pb n="17" facs="tcp:104314:21"/> been condemned by the Church, for not obeying it;
then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veening Clerks having been always practised in <hi>England,</hi>
was no sin, notwithstanding the Decree to the contrary which was never
receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here. Nor is this to be compared to those priviledges that concern
only a Private mans Interest, for the Common-Wealth of the whole Realm was
chiefly to be lookt at, and to be preferred to all other things.</p>
            <p>When the Matter was thus argued on both sides, all the Judges
delivered their Opinions, in these words. <hi>That all those of the
Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation who did award the Citation against</hi> Standish, <hi>were in the
case of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire facias</hi>; and added somewhat about the Constitution of
the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which being forreign to my business, and contrary to a
received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I need not mention, but refer the Reader to <hi>Keilway</hi>
for his Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he desires to know more of it: and thus the Court
broke up. But soon after, all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, with many of
the House of Commons, and all the Judges and the Kings Council, were called
before the King to <hi>Baynards</hi> Castle; and in all their presence the
Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal kneeled down before the King, and in the name of the Clergy said,
<hi>That none of them intended to do any thing that might derogate from his
Prerogative, and least of all himself, who owed his advancement only to the
Kings favour. But this matter of Conveening of Clerks, did seem to them all to
be contrary to the Laws of God, and the Liberties of the Church, which they
were bound by their Oaths to maintain according to their Power.</hi> Therefore
in their name he humbly begged, <hi>That the King to avoid the Censures of the
Church, would refer the Matter to the decision of the Pope and his Council, at
the Court of</hi> Rome. To which the King answered, <hi>It seems to us that
Doctor</hi> Standish, <hi>and others of our Spiritual Council, have answered
you fully in all points.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> replyed,
<hi>Sir, I warrant you Doctor</hi> Standish <hi>will not abide by his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
at his peril.</hi> But the Doctor said, <hi>what should one poor Frier doe
alone, against all the Bishops and Clergy of</hi> England? After a short
silence the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> said, <hi>That in former times
divers holy Fathers of the Church had opposed the execution of that Law, and
some of them suffered Martyrdome in the Quarrel.</hi> To whom <hi>Fineux</hi>
Lord Chief Justice said, <hi>That many holy Kings had mantained that Law, and
many holy Fathers had given Obedience to it, which it is not to be presumed
they would have done, had they known it to be contrary to the Law of God</hi>:
and he desired to know by what Law Bishops could judge Clerks for Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it
being a thing only determined by the Temporal Law; so that either it was not at
all to be tryed, or it was only in the Temporal Court; so that either Clerks
must do as they please, or be tryed in the Civil Courts. To this no Answer
being made, the King said these words: <hi>By the Permission and Ordinance of
God we are King of</hi> England, <hi>and the Kings of</hi> England <hi>in times
past had never any Superiour, but God only. Therefore know you well that we
will maintain the Right of our Crown, and of our Temporal Iurisdiction as well
in this, as in all other points, in as ample manner as any of our Progenitours
have done before our time. And as for your Decrees we are well assured that you
of the Spirituality go expresly against the words of divers of them, as hath
been shewed you by some of our Council; and you interpret your Decrees at your
pleasure, but we will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to them more than our Progenitors have done in
former times.</hi> But the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> made most humble
Instance, that the <pb n="18" facs="tcp:104314:22"/> Matter might be so long respited, till
they could get a Resolution from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they should
procure at their own Charges; and if it did consist with the Law of God, they
should conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Law of the Land. To this the King made no
answer: but the Warrants being out against Doctor <hi>Horsey</hi> the Bishop of
<hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don's</hi> Chancellour, he did abscond in the Arch-Bishops house;
though it was pretended he was a Prisoner there, till afterwards a temper was
found, that <hi>Horsey</hi> should render himself a Prisoner in the Kings Bench
and be tryed. But the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> made earnest Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to
the Cardinal that he would move the King to command the Attourney-General to
confess the Inditement was not true, that it might not be referred to a Jury;
since he said the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> did so favour Heresie, that if he
were as Innocent as <hi>Abel</hi> they would find any Clerk guilty. The King
not willing to irritate the Clergy too much, and judging he had maintained his
Prerogative by bringing <hi>Horsey</hi> to the Bar, ordered the Attourney to do
so. And accordingly when <hi>Horsey</hi> was brought to the Bar and Endited of
Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he pleaded <hi>Not guilty</hi>; which the Attourney acknowledging, he
was dismissed, and went and lived at <hi>Exeter,</hi> and never again came back
to <hi>London,</hi> either out of fear or shame. And for Doctor
<hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish,</hi> upon the Kings Command, he was also dismissed out of the
Court of Convocation.</p>
            <p>It does not appear that the Pope thought fit to interpose in this
Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For though upon less Provocations, Popes had proceeded to the highest
Censures against Princes, yet this King was otherwise so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Pope
at this time, that he was not to be offended. The Clergy suffered much in this
business, besides the loss of their reputation with the people, who involved
them all in the guilt of <hi>Hunne's</hi> Murder; for now their Exemption being
well examined, was found to have no foundation at all, but in their own
Decrees; and few were much convinced by that authority, since upon the matter
it was but a judgment of their own, in their own favours: nor was the City of
<hi>London</hi> at all satisfied with the Proceedings in the Kings Bench, since
there was no justice done; and all thought the King seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more careful to
maintain his Prerogative than to do Justice.</p>
            <p>This I have related the more fully, because it seems to have had
great Influence on peoples minds, and to have disposed them much to the Changes
that followed afterwards. How these things were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Books of
Convocation, cannot be now known. For among the other sad losses sustained in
the late burning of <hi>London,</hi> this was one, that almost all the
Registers of the Spiritual Courts were burnt, some few of the Arch-Bishops of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> and Bishops of <hi>London's</hi> Registers being only
preserved. But having compared <hi>Fox</hi> his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this and some other
matters, and finding it exactly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Registers that are preserved,
I shall the more confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly build, on what he published from those Records
that are now lost.</p>

complement him with those Papal Presents of Roses, and at his desire made

oblige Princes in those days, when a Title or a Rose was thought a sufficient
Recompence for the greatest Services.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal Governing all Temporal Affairs as he did, it is not
to be doubted but his Authority was absolute in Ecclesiastical Matters, which
seemed naturally to lie within his Province; yet <hi>Warham</hi> made some
opposition to him, and complained to the King of his encroaching too much in
his Legantine Courts, upon his Jurisdiction; and the things being clearly made
out, the King chid the Cardinal sharply for it, who ever after that hated

this Bull was not more invidious, than the words in which it was conceived were
offensive; for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble of it was full of severe Reflections against the

of Kings. And even in performing Divine Offices, and saying Mass, he did it
with the same Ceremonies that the Popes use; who judg themselves so nearly
related to God, that those humble acts of Adoration, which are Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in
other persons, would abase them too much. He had not only Bishops and Abbots to
serve him, but even Dukes and Earls to give him the Water and the Towel. He had
certainly a vast mind; and he saw the corruptions of the Clergy gave so great
Scandal, and their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance was so profound, that unless some effectual ways
were taken for correcting these, they must needs fall into great disesteem with
the People: For though he took great liberties himself, and perhaps accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Maxime of the Canonists, he judged Cardinals as Princes of the Church
were not comprehended within ordinary Ecclesiastical Laws;<note place="margin">He
  designs a Reformation</note> yet he seemed to have designed the Reformation of
the Inferiour Clergy by all the means he could think of, except the giving them
a good Example: Therefore he intended to visit all the Monasteries of

justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the design he had to suppress most of them, and convert them into
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks, Cathedrals, Collegiate Churches and Colledges: For which end he
procured the Bull from <hi>Rome</hi>: but he was diverted from making any use
of it; by some who advised him rather to suppress Monasteries by the Popes
Authority,<note place="margin">And a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Monasteries.</note> than
proceed in a Method which would raise great hatred against himself, cast foul
aspersions on Religious Orders, and give the Enemies of the Church great

did not prefix the day: requiring them only to be Summoned to meet with all
convenient speed; and the Arch-Bishops, having the King's pleasure signified to
them, did in their Writs prefix the day. Other Convocations were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the
Arch-Bishops in their several Provinces upon great Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies to meet and
treat of things relating to the Church, and were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Councils. Of this
I find but one, and that called by <hi>Warham</hi> in the first year of this
King,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 4<hi>th.</hi>
               </note> for
restoring the Ecclesiastical Immunities that had been very much impaired, as
will appear by the Writ of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. But the Cardinal did now, as Legate, issue
out Writs for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.<note place="margin">Regist. <hi>Tonst.</hi> Fol. 33,

from the King to <hi>Warham</hi> to call one, who upon that Summoned it to meet
at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> But the Cardinal
prevailed so far with the King, that on the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> after,
he by his Legantine Authority dissolved that Convocation; and issued out a Writ
to <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall</hi> Bishop of <hi>London</hi> to bring the Clergy of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s in <hi>Westminster,</hi> there to
meet and reform Abuses in the Church; and <pb n="21" facs="tcp:104314:23"/> consider of
other important Matters that should be proposed to them. What they did towards
Reformation, I know not, the Records being lost: But as to the Kings Supply, it
was proposed, That they should give the King the half of the full value of
their Livings for one year, to be paid in Five years. The Cardinal laid out to
them how much the King had merited from the Church, both by suppressing the
Schism that was like to have been in the Papacy in Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> his
time, and by Protecting the See of <hi>Rome</hi> from the <hi>French</hi>
Tyrannie; but most of all, for that excellent Book written by him in Defence of
the Faith against the Hereticks: and that therefore, since the <hi>French</hi>
King was making War upon him, and had sent over the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> to
<hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to make War also on that side, it was fit that on so great
an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, it should appear that his Clergy were sensible of their
Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in having such a King; which they ought to express in granting
somewhat, that was as much beyond all former Presidents, as the King had
merited more from them than all former Kings had ever done.</p>
            <p>But the Bishops of <hi>Winchester</hi> and <hi>Rochester</hi>
opposed this: For they both hated the Cardinal. The one thought him ungrateful
to him who had raised him: The other being a man of a strict Life hated him for
his Vices. Both these spake against it as an unheard-of Tax, which would so
oppress the Clergy, that it would not be possible for them to live and pay it;
and that this would become a Precedent for after-times, which would make the
condition of the Clergy most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable. But the Cardinal, who intended that
the Convocation by a great Subsidy should lead the way to the Parliament, took
much pains for carrying it thorough; and got some to be absent, and others were
prevailed on to consent to it: And for the fear of its being made a Precedent,
a Clause was put in the Act, <hi>That it should be no Precedent for
after-times.</hi> Others laughed at this, and said, It would be a Precedent for
all that, if it once passed. But in the end it was granted, with a most
glorious Preamble;<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5th.</note> and by
it all the Natives of <hi>England</hi> that had any Ecclesiastical Benefice
were to pay the full half of the true value of their Livings in Five years; and
all Forreigners who were Beneficed in <hi>England</hi> were to pay a whole
years Rent in the same time: out of which number were excepted the Bishops of
<hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Landaffe, Polidore Virgil, Peter</hi> the
<hi>Carmelite, Erasmus</hi> of <hi>Roterdam, Silvester Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and
<hi>Peter Vannes,</hi> who were to pay only as Natives did. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the
hatred that the Clergy bore the Cardinal. But he despised them, and in
particular was a great Enemy to the Monks, and looked on them as idle mouths
that did neither the Church nor State any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but were through their
scandalous Lives a reproach to the Church, and a burden to the State. Therefore
he resolved to suppress a great number of them, and to change them to another
Institution.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104314:24"/> Bishops, Six Abbots, (but neither Bishoprick nor Abbey are
named) Six Dukes, and Five Knights, but there is no Seal to it. It bears, that
the King, with the Council and Consent of his Princes and Gentry, did Confirm
and Establish that Priory; and that he had Erected 47 Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, which he
intended to encrease to 50. the number of Jubilee; and that the former
Incumbents should be for ever excluded from all pretensions to their Benefices,
because they had rather chosen, with the danger of their Order, and the
prejudice of the Ecclesiastical Benefice, to adhere to their Wives, than to
serve God Chastly and Canonically.</p>
            <p>The Monks being thus setled in most Cathedrals of
<hi>England,</hi> gave themselves up to Idleness and Pleasure, which had been
long complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of; but now that Learning began to be restored, they being
every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where possessed of the best Church-Benefices, were looked upon by all
Learned-men with an evil eye, as having in their hands the chief encouragements
of Learning, and yet doing nothing towards it; they on the contrary decrying
and disparaging it all they could, saying, It would bring in Heresie, and a
great deal of mischief. And the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Learning, such as <hi>Erasmus,
Vives,</hi> and others, did not spare them, but did expose their Ignorance and
ill Manners to the world.</p>
            <p>Now the King naturally loved Learning, and therefore the Cardinal,
either to do a thing which he knew would be acceptable to the King, or that it
was also agreeable to his own Inclinations, resolved to set up some
Colledges,<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Colledges</note> in which there
should be both great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for eminent Scholars to prosecute their
Studies, and good Schools for teaching and training up of Youth. This he knew
would be a great honour to him, to be lookt upon as a Patron of Learning; and
therefore he set his heart much on it, to have Two Colledges (the one at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> the other at <hi>Ipswich,</hi> the place of his Birth) well
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, and nobly Endowed. But towards this, it was necessary to suppress
some Monasteries, which was thought every-whit as justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and lawful, as
it had been many Ages before, to change Secular Prebends into Canons Regular;
the endowed Goods being still applied to a Religious use. And it was thought
hard to say, That if the Pope had the absolute Power of dispensing the
Spiritual Treasure of the Church, and to translate the Merits of one man, and
apply them to another; that he had not a much more absolute Power over the
Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Treasure of the Church, to translate Church-Lands from one use, and
apply them to another. And indeed the Cardinal was then so much considered at
<hi>Rome,</hi> as a Pope of another world; that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he desired he easily
obtained. Therefore on the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1524. Pope
<hi>Clement</hi> by a Bull gave him Authority to suppress the Monastery of St.
<hi>Frediswood</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and in the Diocess of <hi>Lincoln,</hi>
and to carry the Monks elsewhere,<note place="margin">The Bull and Royal As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,

               </note> with a very full <hi>non

<hi>April</hi> following. After this there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many other Bulls for other
Religious Houses and Rectories that were Impropriated. These Houses being thus
suppressed by the Law, they belonged to the King; who thereupon made them over
to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal by new and special Grants, which are all Enrolled. And so he
went on with these great Foundations, and brought them to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That at

               </note> there were many that disliked most of the received

hateful to the people; for as the Pope did exact heavily on them, so they being
oppressed took all means possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make the people repay what the Popes
wrested from them. <hi>Wickliffe</hi> being much encouraged and supported by
the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Piercy,</hi> the Bishops
could not proceed against him till the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was put from
the King, and then he was condemned at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Many opinions are
charged upon him, but whether he held them or not, we know not, but by the
Testimonies of his Enemies, who write of him with so much passion, that it
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credits all they say; yet he dyed in peace, though his body was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
burnt. He translated the Bible out of Latine into <hi>English,</hi> with a long
Preface before it, in which he reflected severely on the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the
Clergy, and condemned the Worshipping of Saints and Images, and denyed the
corporal Presence of Christs Body in the Sacrament, and exhorted all people to
the Study of the Scriptures. His Bible with this Preface was well received by a
great many, who were led into these Opinions, rather by the Impressions which
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense and plain Reason made on them, than by any deep Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or
Study. For the followers of this Doctrine were illiterate and ignorant men:
some few Clerks joyned to them, but they formed not themselves into any body or
association; and were scattered over the Kingdom, holding these Opinions in
private without making any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Profession of them: Generally they were
known by their dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the superstitious Clergy, whose Corruptions were
then so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and their Cruelty so enraged, that no wonder the people
were deeply prejudiced against them. Nor were the methods they used likely to
prevail much upon them, being severe and cruel.</p>
            <p>In the Primitive Church, though in their Councils they were not

               </note> yet all
Capital proceedings against Hereticks were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when two Bishops did
prosecute <hi>Priscillian,</hi> and his followers before the Emperor
<hi>Maximus,</hi> upon which they were put to death, they were generally so
blamed for it, that many refused to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them. The
<hi>Roman</hi> Emperors made many Laws against He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, for the fining and
banishing of them, and secluded them from the Priviledges of other Subjects;
such as <hi>making Wills,</hi> or <hi>receiving Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>; only the
<hi>Manichees</hi> (who were a strange mixture between Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism and
Christianity) were to suffer death for their errors. Yet the Bishops in those
days, particularly in <hi>Africk,</hi> doubted much, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the
Insolencies of Hereticks, or Schismaticks, they might desire the Emperor to
execute those Laws for Fining, Banishing, and other restraints. And St.
<hi>Austin</hi> was not easily prevailed on to consent to it. But at length the
<hi>Donatists</hi> were so intolerable, that after several Consultations about
it, they were forced to consent to those inferiour penalties, but still
condemned the taking away of their lives. And even in the Execution of the
Imperial Laws in those inferiour punishments, <pb n="24" facs="tcp:104314:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> they
were always interposing, to moderate the severity of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and
Governours. The first Instance of severity on mens bodies that was not censured
by the Church, was in the Fifth Century un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Iustine</hi> the first, who
Ordered the tongue of <hi>Severus</hi> (who had been Patriarch of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> but did daily Anathematise the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>)
to be cut out. In the Eighth Century <hi>Iustinian</hi> the 2d (called
<hi>Rhinotmetus</hi> from his cropt nose) burnt all the <hi>Manichees</hi> in
<hi>Armenia:</hi> And in the end of the Eleventh Century the <hi>Bogomili</hi>
were condemned to be burnt by the Patriarch and Council of
<hi>Constantinople.</hi> But in the end of the 12, and in the beginning of the
13th Century, a Company of Simple and Innocent persons in the Southern parts of
<hi>France,</hi> being disgusted with the Corruptions both of the Popish Clergy
and of the publick Worship, separated from their Assemblies; and then
<hi>Dominick</hi> and his <hi>brethren-Preachers,</hi> who came among them to
convince them, finding their Preaching did not prevail, betook themselves to
that way, that was sure to silence them. They perswaded the Civil Magistrates
to burn all such as were judged Obstinate Hereticks. That they might do this by
a Law, the Fourth Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> did Decree, that all Hereticks
should be delivered to the <hi>Secular Power</hi> to be <hi>extirpated</hi>;
(they thought not fit to speak out, but by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it was known that
<hi>Burning</hi> was that which they meant;) and if they did it not, they were
to be Excommunicated; and after that, if they still refused to do their duty,
(which was upon the matter to be the Inquisitors Hangmen) they were to deny it
at their utmost Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils. For not only the Ecclesiastical Censures, but
Anathema's were thought too feeble a punishment for this Omission. Therefore a
Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was found out, as severe upon the Prince, as Burning was to the poor
Heretick. <hi>He was to be deposed by the Pope, his Subjects to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
from their Oaths of Allegiance, and his Dominions to be given away, to any
other faithful Son of the Church, such as pleased the Pope best</hi> and all
this by the Authority of a Synod, that passed for a <hi>Holy Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council.</hi> This as it was fatal to the Counts of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> who were
great Princes in the South of <hi>France,</hi> and first fell under the
Censures; so it was terrible to all other Princes, who thereupon, to save
themselves delivered up their Subjects to the Mercy of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Courts.</p>

this signal difference, that they could find no such effectual way to oblige
God to execute their sentence, as they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against the Civil Magistrate.
But however they confidently gave it out, that by vertue of that Promise of our
Saviours, <hi>Whose sins ye bind on Earth, they are bound in Heaven,</hi> their
Decrees were ratified in Heaven. And it not being easie to disprove what they
said, people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the one, as they saw the other Sentence executed. So

            <p>There was no occasion for the execution of this Law in

sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ingenious words, did draw the people to follow them and defend them by
strong hand, and in great routs. Therefore it was Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that upon the
Bishops certifying into the <hi>Chancery</hi> the names of such Preachers and
their Abettors, the Chancellour should issue forth Commissions to the Sheriffs
and others the Kings Ministers, to hold them in Arrest and strong Prison till
they should <hi>justify them</hi> according to the Law and reason of Holy
Church. From the gentleness of which law it may appear, that <hi>England</hi>
was not then so tame as to bear the severity of those cruel laws which were
setled and put in execution in other Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The Custome at that time was to engross Copies of all the Acts of
Parliament,<note place="margin">

Sheriffs, to make them be proclaimed within their jurisdictions. And <hi>Iohn
Braibrook</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> then Lord Chancellour, sent this with
the other Acts of that Parliament to be proclaimed. The Writ bears date the

               </note> the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preferred a Bill reciting the former Act, and constantly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that they had never assented to it, and therefore desired it might be declared
to be void; for they Protested it was never their intent to be <hi>Iustified,
and to bind themselves and their Successors to the Prelats, more than their
Ancestors had done in times past.</hi> To which the King gave the Royal Assent,
as it is in the Records of Parliament. But in the Proclamation of the Acts of
that Parliament this Act was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; so that the former Act was still
looked on as a good law, and is Printed in the Book of Statutes. Such pious
frauds were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways practised by the Popish Clergy, and were indeed necessary
for the supporting the Credit of that Church. When <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d was
deposed and the Crown usurped by <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, then he in gratitude
to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy that assisted him in his coming to the Crown,<note place="margin">Another Law under King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th.</note> granted them
a law to their hearts content in the 2<hi>d.</hi> year of his Reign. The
Preamble bears, <hi>That some had a new Faith about the Sacraments of the
Church, and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the same; and did Preach without Authority,
gathered Conventicles, taught Schools, wrote Books against the Catholick Faith;
with many other heinous aggravations. Upon which the Prelats and Clergy, and
the Commons of the Realm prayed the King to provide a sufficient remedy to so
great an evil. Therefore the King by the assent of the States, and other
discreet men of the Realm being in the said Parliament, did Ordain, That none
should <pb n="26" facs="tcp:104314:26"/> Preach without Licence, except persons Priviledged;
That none should Preach any Doctrine contrary to the Catholick Faith, or the
Determination of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church, and that none should favour and abett them,
nor keep their Books, but deliver them to the Diocesan of the place within</hi>
40 <hi>days after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of that Statute. And that if any Persons
were defamed, or suspected of doing against that Ordinance, then the Ordinary
might Arrest them, and keep them in his Prison, till they were Canonically
purged of the Articles laid against them, or did abjure them according to the
Laws of the Church. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided always that the proceedings against them were
publickly and judicially done and ended, within three Months after they had
been so Arrested; and if they were Convict, the Diocesan, or his Commissaries,
might keep them in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as long as to his discretion shall seem expedient,
and might Fine them as should seem competent to him, certifying the Fine into
the Kings Exchequer; and if any being Convict did refuse to abjure, or after
Abjuration did fall into Relapse, then he was to be left to the Secular Court
according to the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. And the Majors, Sheriffs, or Bayliffs were to be
personally present at the passing the Sentence, when they should be required by
the Diocesan, or his Commissaries, and after the Sentence they were to receive
them, and them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People in a high place do to be Brent.</hi> By this
Statute the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, or other Officers, were immediatly to proceed to the
Burning of Hereticks without any Writ, or Warrant from the King. But it seems
the Kings Learned Council advised him to issue out a Writ, <hi>De Haeretico
comburendo,</hi> upon what grounds of Law I cannot tell. For in the same year
when <hi>William Sartre</hi> (who was the first that was put to death upon the
account of Heresie) was judged Relapse by <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fitz Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s <hi>Natura
  Brevium.</hi>
               </note> in a Convocation of his Province, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was
degraded from Priesthood, and left to Secular Power; a Writ was issued out to
Burn him, which in the Writ is called, <hi>The Customary Punishment</hi>
(relating it as like to the Customs that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea.) But this Writ was
not necessary by the Law, and therefore it seems these Writs were not Enrolled.
For in the whole Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> I have not been
able to find any of these Writs in the Rolls. But by <hi>Warham</hi>'s Register
I see the Common course of the Law, was to certifie into the Chancery the
Conviction of an Heretick, upon which the Writ was issued out, if the King did
not send a Pardon. Thus it went on all the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the
4<hi>th.</hi> But in the beginning of his Sons Reign, there was a Conspiracy
(as was pretended) by Sir <hi>Iohn Oldcastle,</hi> and some others against the
King and the Clergy; upon which many were put in Prison, and 29 were both
attainted of <hi>Treason,</hi> and condemned of <hi>Heresie,</hi> so they were
both Hanged and Burnt. But as a Writer that lived in the following Age, says,
<hi>Certain affirmed that these were but feigned causes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>surmised of the Spiritualty more of
displeasure than truth.</hi> That Conspiracy, whether real or pretended,
produced a severe Act against those Hereticks, who were then best known by the
name of <hi>Lollards.</hi> By which Act all Officers of State, Judges, Justices
of the Peace, Majors, Sheriffs and Bayliffs, were to be Sworn when they took
their Imployments, to use their whole Power and Diligence to destroy all
Heresies and Errors, called <hi>Lollardies,</hi> and to assist the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
and their Commissaries in their proceedings against them; and that the
<hi>Lollards</hi> should forfeit all the Lands they held in
<hi>Fee-Simple,</hi> and their Goods and Chattels to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:104314:26"/>The Clergy, according to the Genius of that
Religion, having their Authority fortified with such severe Laws, were now more
cruel and insolent than ever. And if any man denied them any part of that
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, or of those advantages to which they pretended, he was presently
brought under the suspition of Heresie, and vexed with Imprisonments, and
Articles were brought against him.</p>
            <p>Upon which great complaints followed. And the Judges to correct
this, granted <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> upon their Imprisonments, and examined the
Warrants, and either Bailed, or Discharged the Prisoners as they saw cause: For
though the Decrees of the Church had made many things Heresie, so that the
Clergy had much matter to work upon; yet when Offenders against them in other
things could not be charged with any formal Heresie, then by consequences they
studied to fasten it on them, but were sometimes over-ruled by the Judges.
Thus,<note place="margin">5th. year of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4th.</note> when one
<hi>Keyser</hi> (who was Excommunicated by <hi>Thomas Bourchier,</hi>
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> at the Suit of another) said openly, that
<hi>That Sentence was not to be feared</hi>; for though the Arch-Bishop, or his
Commissary had Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated him, <hi>yet he was not Excommunicated before
God</hi>; he was upon this Committed by the Arch-Bishop's Warrant, as one
justly suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Heresie: but the Judges upon his moving for an <hi>Habeas
Corpus,</hi> granted it; and the Prisoner being brought to the Bar, with the
War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for his Imprisonment, they found the matter contained in it was not
within the Statute, and first Bailed him, and after that they Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged him.
One <hi>Warner</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> having said, <hi>That he was not bound
to pay Tithes to his Curate,</hi> was also imprisoned by <hi>Edward
Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghan,</hi> at the command of the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>; but he escaped
out of Prison, and brought his Action of false Imprisonment against
<hi>Vaughan.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Vaughan</hi> pleading the Statute of
<hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> and that his Opinion was an Heresie against
the Determination of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith; the Court of the Common-Pleas
judged, That the words were not within the Statute, and <hi>that his Opinion
was an Error, but no Heresie.</hi> So that the Judges looking on themselves as
the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law, thought, That even in the case of Heresie, they
had Authority to declare, what was Heresie by the Law, and what not: But what
opposition the Clergy made to this, I do not know.</p>
            <p>I hope the Reader will easily excuse this Digression, it being so
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to the History that is to follow. I shall next set down what I find
in the Records about the proceedings against Hereticks in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of
this Reign.</p>
            <p>On the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> in the year, 1611. Six Men and
Four Women,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Regist. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Fol. 164.</p>
               </note> most of them
being of <hi>Tenterden,</hi> appeared before Arch-Bishop <hi>Warham,</hi> in
his Mannor of <hi>Knall,</hi> and abjured the following Errors. 1<hi>st.</hi>
That in the Sacrament of the Altar is not the Body of Christ, but Material
Bread. 2<hi>dly.</hi> That the Sacraments of Baptism, and Confirmation, are not
necessary, nor profitable for mens Souls. 3<hi>dly.</hi> That Confession of
Sins ought not to be made to a Priest. 4<hi>thly.</hi> That there is no more
Power given by God to a Priest than to a Layman. 5<hi>thly.</hi> That the
Solemniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Matrimony is not profitable, nor necessary for the well of
mans Soul. 6<hi>thly.</hi> That the Sacrament of Extreme Unction is not
profitable, nor necessary for mans Soul. 7<hi>thly.</hi> That Pilgrimages to
holy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Places be not profitable, neither Meritorious for mans Soul. 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104314:27"/> 8<hi>thly.</hi> That Images of Saints be not to be
worshipped. 9<hi>thly.</hi> That a man should pray to no Saint, but only to
God. 10<hi>thly.</hi> That holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and holy bread be not the better after
the Benediction made by the Priest, than before. And as they abjured these
Opinions, so they were made to Swear, That they should discover all whom they
knew to hold these Errors, or who were suspected of them, or that did keep any
pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conventicles, or were Fautors, or Comforters of them that published
such Doctrins. Two other men of <hi>Tenterden</hi> did that day in the
Afternoon abjure most of these Opinions. The Court sate again the 5<hi>th.</hi>
of <hi>May,</hi> and the Arch-Bishop enjoyned them Penance, to wear the Badg of
a Fagot in Flames on their Cloaths during their lives, or till they were
dispensed with for it; and that in the Procession both at the Cathedral of
<hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and at their own Parish Churches they should carry a
Fagot on their shoulders: which was looked on as a publick Confession that they
deserved Burning.</p>
            <p>That same day another of <hi>Tenterdon</hi> abjured the same
Doctrines. On the 15<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> the Court sate at
<hi>Lambeth,</hi> where 4 Men and one Woman abjured. On the 19<hi>th.</hi> Four
Men more abjured. On the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> a Man and a Woman
abjured. Another Woman the 26<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi>: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man the
29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi>: Two Women on the 2<hi>d.</hi> of
<hi>August</hi>: A Man on the 3<hi>d.</hi> and a Woman on the 8<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>August</hi>: Three Men on the 16<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>August</hi>: And three
Men and a Woman on the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Sept.</hi> In these Abjurations some
were put to abjure more, some fewer of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Doctrines; and in some of
their Abjurations Two Articles more were added, 1<hi>st.</hi> That the Images
of the Crucifix, of our Lady and other Saints, ought not to be worshipped,
because they were made with mens hands, and were but Stocks and Stones.
2<hi>dly.</hi> That Money and Labour spent in Pilgrimages was all in vain. All
these Persons (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were unjustly accused, or were overcome with fear,
or had but crude conceptions of those Opinions, and so were easily frighted out
of them) abjured and performed the Penance that was enjoyned them. Others met
with harder measure, for on the 29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> in the same
year, 1511. one <hi>William Carder</hi> of <hi>Tenterdon,</hi> being Endited on
the former Articles, he denied them all but one, <hi>That he had said it was
enough to pray to Almighty God alone, and therefore we needed not to pray to
Saints for any mediation.</hi> Upon which Witnesses were brought against him,
who were all such as were then Prisoners, but intended to abjure, and were now
made use of to Convict others. They Swore that he had taught them these
Opinions. When their Depositions were published, he said, he did repent if he
had said any thing against the Faith and the Sacraments; but he did not
remember that he had ever said any such thing. Sentence was given upon him as
an obstinate Heretick, and he was delivered up to the Secular Power. On the
same day a Woman, <hi>Agnes Grevill,</hi> was Endited upon the same Articles:
She pleaded <hi>not Guilty,</hi> but by a strange kind of proceeding, her
Husband and her Two Sons were brought in Witnesses against her. Her Husband
deposed, that in the end of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi>
one <hi>Iohn Ive,</hi> had perswaded her into these Opinions, in which she had
persisted ever since: Her Sons also deposed, that she had been still infusing
these Doctrines into them. One <hi>Robert Harrison</hi> was also Endited, and
pleading <hi>not Guilty,</hi> Witnesses did prove the Articles against him. And
on the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <pb n="29" facs="tcp:104314:27"/> 
               <hi>May</hi> Sentence was given
against these Two as obstinate He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

words: <hi>Our holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church having nothing further that she can do
in this matter, we leave the forementioned Hereticks, and every one of them to
your Royal Highness, and to your Secular Council.</hi> And on the 8<hi>th.</hi>

               <hi>May, Iohn Brown</hi> and
<hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Walker,</hi> being also Endited of Heresie on the former Points,
they both pleaded <hi>not Guilty.</hi> But the Witnesses deposing against them,
they were judged obstinate Hereticks, and the former a Relapse, for he had

When, or how the Sentences were Executed, I cannot find. Sure I am, there are
no Pardons upon Record <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or any of
them, and it was the course of the Law, either to send a Pardon, or to issue
out the Writ for Burning them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fox</hi> mentions none of these proceedings, only he tells
that <hi>Iohn Brown</hi> was taken for some words said in Discourse with a
Priest, about the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Masses for Redeeming Souls out of Purgatory. Upon
which he was committed for suspition of Heres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of his Burning, which he says was, <hi>Anno</hi> 1517. for they would not have

of any such clemency. These severe Sentences made the rest so apprehensi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

who were Endited, abjured. And in the year, 1512. on the 5<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>Iune,</hi> Two men and two women abjured that Article, That in the
Sacrament of the Altar, there was only Material Bread, and not the Body of

There are but Three Abjurations. In the year 1509. one <hi>Elizabeth
Sampson,</hi> of <hi>Aldermanbury,</hi> was Endited for having spoken
reproachfully of the Images of our Lady, of <hi>Willsden, Crom,</hi> and
<hi>Walsingham,</hi> condemning Pilgrimages to them, and saying, It was better
to give Alms at home to poor people, than to go on Pilgrimages; and that Images
were but Stocks and Stones, and denying the vertue of the Sacrament of the
Altar, when the Priest was not in clean li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and saying, It was but Bread, and that Christ could
not be both in Heaven and Earth; and for denying Christ's Ascension to Heaven,
and saying, That more should not go to Heaven than were already in it. But she,
to be free of further trouble, confessed her self Guilty, and abjured all those
Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. It is generally observed, That in the proceedings against
<hi>Lollards,</hi> the Clergy always mixed some Capital Errors, which all
Christians rejected, with those for which they accused them; and some
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars being proved, they gave it out that they were Guilty of them all,
to represent them the more odious. And in this case the thing is plain, for
this woman is charged for denying Christ's Ascension; and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the
Articles was, That she said Christ's Body could not be in the Sacrament,
because it could not be both in Heaven and on Earth. Which two Opinions are
inconsistent. In the year 1511. <hi>William Potier</hi> was Endited for saying,
There were Three Gods, and that he knew not for what Christ's Passion, or
Baptism availed; and did abjure. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="30" facs="tcp:104314:28"/> he only spoke
these things Impiously, or whether he held them in Opinion, is not clear. But
certainly he was no <hi>Lollard.</hi> One <hi>Ioan Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> was also made to
abjure some words she had said, That Images were but Idols, and not to be
worshipped; and that they were set up by the Priest out of Covetousness, that
they might grow rich by them; and that Pilgrimages were not to be made. More is
not in that Register. But <hi>Fox</hi> gives an account of Six others, who were
Burnt in <hi>Fitz-Iames</hi> his time. On this I have been the longer, that it
may appear, what were the Opinions of the <hi>Lollards</hi> at that time before
<hi>Luther</hi> had publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed any thing against the Indulgences. For these
Opinions did very much dispose people to receive the Writings which came
afterwards out of <hi>Germany.</hi>

               </gap> the world had not been strongly disposed to it, by the just
prejudices they had conceived against the Popish Clergy, whose Ignorance and
lewd Lives had laid them so open to contempt and hatred, that any one that
would set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against them, could not but be kindly looked on by the
people. They had engrossed the greatest part both of the Riches and Power of
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, and lived at their ease and in much Wealth. And the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of their Worship and Doctrine were such, that a very small proportion of common
sense, with but an overly looking on the New Testament, discovered them. Nor
had they any other varnish to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour them by, but the Authority and Traditions
of the Church. But when some studious men began to read the Ancient Fathers,
and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils (though there was then a great mixture of Sophisticated stuff
that went under the Ancient names, and was joyned to their true works, which
Criticks have since discovered to be spurious) they found a vast difference
between the first Five Ages of the Christian Church, in which Piety and
Learning prevailed, and the last Ten Ages in which Ignorance had buried all
their former Learning, only a little misguided Devotion was retained for Six of
these Ages; and in the last Four, the restless Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Usurpation of the
Popes was supported by the seeming holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the begging Friers, and the
false Counterfeits of Learning, which were among the Canonists, School-men and
Casuists. So that it was incredible to see, how men, notwithstanding all the
opposition the Princes every-where made to the progress of these reputed new
Opinions, and the great advantages by which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> both
held and drew many into their Interests, were generally inclined to these
Doctrines. Those of the Clergy, who at first Preached them, were of the begging
Orders of Friers, who having fewer engagements on them from their Interests,
were freer to discover and follow the truth. And the austere Discipline they
had been trained under, did prepare them to encounter those difficulties that
lay in their way. And the Laity that had long <pb n="31" facs="tcp:104314:28"/> lookt on
their Pastors with an evil eye, did receive these Opinions very easily; which
did both discover the Impostures with which the world had been abused, and
shewed a plain and simple way to the Kingdom of Heaven, by putting the
Scriptures into their hands, and such other Instructions about Religion, as
were sincere and genuine. The Clergy who at first despised these new Preachers,
were at length much Allarmed when they saw all people running after them, and

               </gap>ceiving their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
            <p>As these things did spread much in <hi>Germany, Switzerland,</hi>
and the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> so their Books came over into <hi>England,</hi>
where there was much matter already prepared to be wrought on, not only by the
prejudices they had conceived against the corrupt Clergy, but by the Opinions
of the <hi>Lollards</hi> which had been now in <hi>England</hi> since the days
of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> for about 150 years. Between which Opinions, and the
Doctrines of the Reformers, there was great Affinity; and therefore, to give
the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vent to the Books that came out of <hi>Germany,</hi> many of them
were translated into the <hi>English</hi>-Tongue, and were very much read and
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded. This quickned the proceedings against the <hi>Lollards,</hi> and
the enquiry became so severe, that great numbers were brought into the Toils of
the Bishops and their Commissaries. If a man had spoken but a light word
against any of the Constitutions of the Church, he was sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on by the
Bishop's Officers; and if any taught their Children the Lord's Prayer, the Ten
Commandments, and the Apostle's Creed in the Vulgar Tongue, that was crime
enough to bring them to the Stake: As it did Six men and a woman at
<hi>Coventry,</hi> in the <hi>Passion-week,</hi> 1519. being the 4<hi>th.</hi>

               </note> Bishop of
<hi>Lincoln</hi> was very cruel to all that were suspected of Heresie in his
Diocess; several of them abjured, and some were Burnt.</p>
            <p>But all that did not produce what they designed by it. The Clergy
did not correct their own faults, and their cruelty was looked on as an
evidence of Guilt, and of a weak Cause; so that the method they took, wrought
only on peoples fears, and made them more cautious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, but did not
at all remove the Cause, nor work either on their reasons or affections.</p>
            <p>Upon all this, the King to get himself a name,<note place="margin">The King writes against <hi>Luther.</hi> 1522.</note> and to have
a lasting Interest with the Clergy, thought it not enough to assist them with
his Authority, but would needs turn their Champion, and write against
<hi>Luther</hi> in defence of the Seven Sacraments. This Book was magnified by
the Clergy as the most Learned Work that ever the Sun saw; and he was compared
to King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and to all the Christian Emperours that had ever
been: And it was the chief subject of flattery for many years, besides the
glorious Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> which the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on
him for it. And it must be acknowledged, that considering the Age, and that it
was the Work of a King, it did deserve some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. But <hi>Luther</hi>
was not at all daunted at it, but rather valued himself upon it, that so great
a King had entred the lists with him, and answered his Book. And he replied,
not without a large mixture of Acrimony, for which he was generally blamed, as
forgetting that great respect, that is due to the Persons of Soveraign
Princes.</p>
            <p>But all would not do. These Opinions still gained more footing,
and <hi>William Tindal</hi> made a Translation of the New Testament in
<hi>English,</hi> 
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:104314:29"/> to which he added some short
Glosses.<note place="margin">

<hi>Antwerp,</hi> and sent over into <hi>England</hi> in the year 1526. Against
which there was a Prohibition published by every Bishop in his Diocess. Bearing
that some of <hi>Luthers</hi> followers had erroneously Translated the New
Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and had corrupted the Word of God, both by a false Translation, and
by Heretical Glosses: Therefore they required all Incumbents to charge all
within their Parishes, that had any of these, to bring them in to the
Vicar-General within 30 days after that premonition, under the pains of
Excommunication and incurring the suspition of Heresie. There were also many
other Books Prohibited at that time, most of them written by <hi>Tindal.</hi>
And Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> who was a man cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for Vertue and
Learning,<note place="margin">Collect. numb. 6th.</note> undertook the answering
of some of those; but before he went about it, he would needs have the Bishops
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for keeping and reading them. He wrote according to the way of the Age
with much bitterness: and though he had been no Friend to the Monks, and a
great declaimer against the Ignorance of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and had been ill used by
the Cardinal; yet he was one of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest Enemies of the new Preachers,
not without great cruelty when he came into Power, though he was otherwise a
very good-natured man. So violently did the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy hurry all
their Friends into those excesses of Fire and Sword.</p>
            <p>When the Party became so considerable, that it was known there
were Societies of them, not only in <hi>London,</hi> but in both the
Universities, then the Cardinal was constrained to act. His contempt of the
Clergy was looked on as that which gave encouragement to the Hereticks. When
reports were brought to Court of a company that were in <hi>Cambridge, Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Latimer,</hi> and others that read and propagated <hi>Luther</hi>'s Book and
Opinions; some Bishops moved, in the year 1523. that there might be a
Visitation appointed to go to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for trying who were the
Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Heresie there. But he, as <hi>Legate,</hi> did inhibite it (upon
what grounds I cannot imagine.) Which was brought against him afterwards in
Parliament (Art. 43. of his Impeachment.) Yet when these Doctrines were spread
every-where, he called a meeting of all the Bishops and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and Canonists
about <hi>London;</hi> where <hi>Thomas Bilney</hi> and <hi>Thomas Arthur</hi>
were brought before them, and Articles were brought in against them. The whole
process is set down at length by <hi>Fox</hi> in all Points ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to
<hi>Tonstall's</hi> Register, except one fault in the Translation. When the
Cardinal asked <hi>Bilney</hi> whether he had not taken an Oath before, not to
preach, or defend any of <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrines; he confessed he had done
it, but not <hi>judicially,</hi> (<hi>judicialiter</hi> in the Register) This
<hi>Fox</hi> Translates, <hi>not lawfully.</hi> In all the other particulars
there is an exact agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Register and his Acts. The sum of the
proceedings of the Court, was, That after examination of Witnesses, and several
other steps in the Process, which the Cardinal left to the Bishop of
<hi>London,</hi> and the other Bishops to manage; <hi>Bilney</hi> stood out
long, and seemed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to suffer for a good Conscience. In the end, what
through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man infirmity, what through the great importunity of the Bishop of
<hi>London,</hi> who set all his Friends on him, he did abjure on the
7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> as <hi>Arthur</hi> had done on the
2<hi>d.</hi> of that Month. And though <hi>Bilney</hi> was relapst, and so was
to expect no mercy by the Law, yet the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> enjoyned him
Penance, and let him go. For <hi>Tonstall</hi> 
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:104314:29"/> being a man
both of good Learning and an unblemisht life, these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues produced one of
their ordinary effects in him, <hi>great moderation,</hi> that was so eminent
in him, that at no time did he dip his hands in Blood. <hi>Geoffrey Loni,</hi>
and <hi>Thomas Gerard,</hi> also abjured for having had <hi>Luther's</hi>
Books, and defending his Opinions.</p>
            <p>These were the proceedings against Hereticks, in the first half of
this Reign. And thus far I have opened the State of Affairs, both as to
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Civil concerns for the first 18 years of this Kings time, with
what Observations I could gather of the dispositions and tempers of the Nation
at that time, which prepared them for the Changes that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

proofs of the Consummation of the Marriage, and sent them into Spain; the young
Prince also himself had by many expressions given his Servants cause to believe
that his Marriage was consummated the first night, which in a youth of Sixteen
years of Age, that was vigorous and healthful, was not at all judged strange.
It was so constantly believed that when he dyed, his young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Brother

Marriage that was disputable, lest out of it new Wars should afterwards arise
about the Right of the Crown, the Popes Dispensation was thought sufficient to
answer all; and his Authority was then so undisputed that it did it

               </note> This
being afterwards neglected and broken by the Emperor, by the advice of his
<hi>Cortes</hi> and States, as was formerly related, there followed some
Overtures of a Marriage with <hi>Scotland.</hi> But those also vanished, and
there was a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Treaty begun with <hi>France,</hi> the King offering his
Daughter to <hi>Francis</hi> himself, which he gladly accepting, a Match was
Treated: and on the last of <hi>April,</hi> it was agreed that the Lady
<hi>Mary</hi> should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Marriage either to <hi>Francis</hi> himself,
or to his second Son the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi>; and that Alternative was to
be determined by the two Kings, at an Enterview that was to be between them,
soon after at <hi>Calais,</hi> with forfeitures on both sides if the Match went
not on.</p>
            <p>But while this was in agitation the Bishop of <hi>Tarbe</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador made a a great demur about the Princess
<hi>Mary's</hi> being ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, as begotten in a Marriage that was
contracted against a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precept, with which no humane Authority could
Dispense. How far this was secretly concerted between the <hi>French</hi> Court
and ours, or between the Cardinal and the Ambassador, is not known. It is
sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised that the King or the Cardinal set on the <hi>French</hi> to make this
exception publickly, that so the King might have a better Colour to justifie
his suit of Divorce, since other Princes were already question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. For if
upon a Marriage proposed of such infinite advantage to <hi>France,</hi> as that
would be with the Heir of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> they never<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heless made Exceptions and proceeded
but coldly in it, it was very reasonable to expect that after the Kings Death,
other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders would have disputed her Title in another manner.</p>
            <p>To some it seemed strange that the King did offer his Daughter to
such great Princes as the Emperor and the King of <hi>France,</hi> to whom if
<hi>England</hi> had fallen in her Right, it must have been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: for
though in the last Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> she was offered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the
King, or his second Son; by which either the Children which the King might have
by her, or the Children of the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> should have been
Heirs to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it would still have
continued divided from <hi>France</hi>; yet this was full of hazard, for if the
Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> by his Brothers Death should become King of
<hi>France,</hi> as it afterwards fell out, or if the King of <hi>France</hi>
had been once possessed of <hi>England,</hi> then according to the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime of
the <hi>French</hi> Government, that whatever their King acquires he holds it
in the Right of his Crown, <hi>England</hi> was still to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to
<hi>France,</hi> unless they freed themselves by Arms. Others judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the
King intended to Marry her to <hi>France,</hi> the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to seclude
her from the Succession, considering the aversion his Subjects had to a
<hi>French</hi> Government, that so he might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily settle his Bastard
Son the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> in the Succession of the Crown.</p>
            <p>While this Treaty went on,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
               </note> the Kings
scruples about his Marriage began to take vent. It is said that the Cardinal
did first infuse them into him, and made <hi>Longland</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Lincoln,</hi> that was the Kings Confessor, possess the Kings mind with
them in Confession. If it was so, the King had, according to the Religion of
that time, very just <pb n="38" facs="tcp:104314:33"/> cause of Scruple, when his Confessor
judged his Marriage sinful, and the Popes Legate was of the same mind. It is
also said that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal being alienated from the Emperor, that he might
irreparably embroil the King and him, and unite the King to the <hi>French</hi>
Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests, designed this out of Spite; and that he was also dissatisfied
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Queen, who hated him for his lewd and dissolute Life, and had oft
admonished and check't him for it: And that he therefore, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to engage
the King to Marry the <hi>French</hi> Kings Sister the Dutchess of
<hi>Alenoon,</hi> did (to make way for that) set this Matter on foot: but as I
see no good Authority for all this, except the Queens suspitions, who did
afterwards charge the Cardinal as the cause of all her trouble;<note place="margin">In his Letter to <hi>Bucer, Sept.</hi> 10. 1531. in MSS. R.
  <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </note> so I am inclined to think the Kings Scruples were much
ancienter, for the King declared to <hi>Simon Grineus</hi> four years after
this, that for seven years he had abstained from the Queen upon these
Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, so that by that it seems they had been received into the Kings mind
three years before this time.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The grounds of his Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note>What were
the Kings secret motives and the true grounds of his Aversion to the Queen, is
only known to God, and till the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all Secrets at the day of
Judgment, must lye hid. But the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which he always owned, of which all
Humane Judicatories must only take notice, shall be now fully opened. He found
by the Law of <hi>Moses, if a man took his Brothers Wife they should die
childless</hi>: This made him reflect on the death of his Children, which he
now looked on as a Curse from God for that unlawful Marriage. Upon this he set
himself to Study the case, and called for the judgments of the best Divines and
Canonists. For his own Enquiry, <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> being the Writer in
whose works he took most pleasure, and to whose judgment he submitted most, did
decide it clearly against him. For he both Concluded, that the Laws in
<hi>Leviticus</hi> about the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den degrees of Marriage were Moral and
Eternal, such as obliged all Christians; and that the Pope could only Dispense
with the Laws of the Church, but could not Dispense with the Laws of God. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this reason, that no Law can be Dispenced with, by any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but that
which is equal to the Authority that enacted it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he infers that the
Pope can indeed Dispence with all the Laws of the Church, but not with the Laws
of God, to whose Authority he could not pretend to be equal. But as the King
found this from his own private Study, so having commanded the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> to require the Opinions of the Bishops of <hi>England,</hi>
they all in a Writing under their hands and Seals,<note place="margin">All his
  Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, except <hi>Fisher,</hi> declare it unlawful.</note> declared they
judged it an unlawful Marriage. Only the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> refused
to set his hand to it, and though the Arch-Bishop pressed him most earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to it, yet he persisted in his refusal, saying, that it was against his
Conscience. Upon which the Arch-Bishop made another write down his Name,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cavendish</hi> his li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of <hi>Wolsey.</hi>
               </note> and set his Seal to the Resolution of
the rest of the Bishops. But this being afterwards questioned, the Bishop of
<hi>Rochester</hi> denied it was his hand, and the Arch-Bishop pretended that
he had leave given him by the Bishop to put his hand to it, which the other
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. Nor was it likely that <hi>Fisher</hi> who scrupled in Conscience to
Subscribe it himself, would have consented to such a weak Artifice. But all the
other Bishops did declare against the Marriage, and as the <pb n="39" facs="tcp:104314:33"/>
King himself said afterwards in the <hi>Legantine</hi> Court, neither the
Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal nor the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> did first suggest these scruples,
but the King being possessed with them, did in Confession propose them to that
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop: and added that the Cardinal was so far from cherishing them, that he
did all he could to stiffle them.</p>
            <p>The King was now convinced that his Marriage was unlawful,<note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that were like to follow from it.</note> both by his
own study, and the resolution of his Divines. And as the point of Conscience
wrought on him, so the Interest of the Kingdom required, that there should be
no doubting about the Succession to the Crown: left as the long Civil-War
between the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> had been buried with
his Father, so a new one should rise up at his death. The King of
<hi>Scotland</hi> was the next Heir to the Crown after his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And if he
Married his Daughter to any out of <hi>France,</hi> then he had reason to
judge, that the <hi>French</hi> upon their Ancient Alliance with
<hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that they might divide and distract <hi>England,</hi>
would be ready to assist the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> in his pretensions: Or
if he Married her in <hi>France,</hi> then all those in <hi>England</hi> to
whom the <hi>French</hi> Government was hateful, and the Emperour and other
Princes to whom the <hi>French</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er grew formidable, would have been as
ready to support the pretensions of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Or if he should either
set up his Barstard Son, or the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren which his Sister bore to <hi>Charles
Brandon,</hi> there was still cause to fear a Bloody decision of a Title that
was so doubtful. And though this may seem a consideration too Politick and
Forreign to a matter of that nature; yet the obligation that lies on a Prince
to provide for the happiness and quiet of his Subjects, was so weighty a thing,
that it might well come in among other Motives, to incline the King much to
have this matter determined.<note place="margin">

  11.</note> At this time the Cardinal went over into <hi>France</hi> under
colour to conclude a League between the Two Crowns, and to Treat about the
means of setting the Pope at liberty, who was then the Emperours Prisoner at
<hi>Rome</hi>; and also for a project of Peace between <hi>Francis,</hi> and
the Emperour. But his chief business was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>Francis</hi> to
declare his Resolutions concerning that alternative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lady
<hi>Mary.</hi> To which it was answered, That the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> as
a fitter Match in years, was the <hi>French</hi> King's Choice; but this matter
fell to the ground upon the Process that followed soon a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter.</p>
            <p>The King did much apprehend the opposition the Emperour was like
to make to his designs;<note place="margin">The Kings fears &amp; hopes about
  it.</note> either out of a principle of nature and honour to protect his Aunt,
or out of a Maxime of State, to raise his Enemy all the trouble he could at
home. But on the other hand he had some cause to hope well even in that
particular. For the Question of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Match had been first
debated in the <hi>Cortes,</hi> or Assembly of the States at <hi>Madrid</hi>;
and the Emperour had then shewed himself so
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avourable to it, that he broke the
Match, (to which he had bound himself) with the Princess. Therefore the King
had reason to think that this at least would mitigate his opposition. The
Emperour had also used the Pope so hardly, that it could not be doubted that
the Pope hated him. And it was believed that he would find the protection of
the King of <hi>England</hi> most necessary to secure him, either from the
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> who were Fighting for the best
part of <hi>Italy,</hi> which must needs fall into one of their hands.
Therefore the King did not doubt but the Pope would be compliant to his
desires. And in this <pb n="40" facs="tcp:104314:34"/> he was much confirmed by the hopes,
or rather assurance, which the Cardinal gave him of the Popes favour; who
either calculating what was to be expected from that Court on the account of
their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, or upon some promises made him, had undertaken to the King
to bring that matter about to his hearts content. It is certain that the
Cardinal had carried over with him out of the Kings Treasure 240000 <hi>l.</hi>
to be employed about the Popes Liberty.<note place="margin">L.
  <hi>Herbert.</hi>
               </note> But whether he had made a bargain for the Divorce, or
had fancied that nothing could be denied him at <hi>Rome,</hi> it does not
appear. It is clear by many of his Letters that he had undertaken to the King,
that the business should be done; and it is not like that a man of his wisdom
would have adventured to do that without some good warrant.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against the Bull.</note>But now
that the Suit was to be moved in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were to
devise such Arguments as were like to be well heard there. It would have been
unacceptable to have insisted on the nullity of the Bull on this account,
because the matter of it was unlawful, and fell not within the Popes Power. For
Popes, like others Princes, do not love to hear the extent of their Prerogative
disputed, or defined. And to condemn the Bull of a former Pope as unlawful, was
a dangerous Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at a time when the Popes Authority was rejected by so
many in <hi>Germany.</hi> Therefore the Canonists as well as Divines, were
consulted to find such Nullities in the Bull of Dispensation, as according to
the Canon-Law, and the proceedings of the <hi>Rota,</hi> might serve to
invalidate it without any diminution of the Papal Power. Which being once done,
the Marriage that followed upon it, must needs be annulled. When the Canonists
examined the Bull, they found much matter to proceed upon. It is a Maxime in
Law, that if the Pope be surprized in any thing, and Bulls be procured upon
false suggestions and untrue premises, they may be annulled a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>terwards. Upon
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hich foundation most of all the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses against Popes Bulls were grounded. Now they found by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
of this Bull that it was said, The King had desired that he might be dispensed
with to Marry the Princess. This was false; for the King had made no such
desire, being of an Age that was below such consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, but Twelve years
old. Then it appeared by the preamble that this Bull was desired by the King to
preserve the Peace between the King of <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> (called <hi>Elizabetha</hi> in the
Bull) the Kings of <hi>Spain.</hi> To which they excepted, That it was plain
this was false, since the King being then but Twelve years old, could not be
supposed to have such deep speculations, and so large a prospect as to desire a
Match upon a politick account. Then it being also in the Bull, that the Popes
Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation was granted to keep Peace between the Crowns, if there was no
hazard of any Breach or War between them, this was a false suggestion, by which
the Pope had been made believe, That this Match was necessary for averting some
great mischief. And it was known that there was no danger
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t all of that, and so this Bull
was obtained by a surprise. Besides, both King <hi>Henry</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> were dead before the
King Married his Queen; so the Marriage could not be valid by vertue of a Bull
that was granted to maintain Amity between Princes that were dead before the
Marriage was consummated: And they also judged that the Protestation which the
King made, when he came of Age, did retract any such pretended desire, that
might have been preferred to the Pope <pb n="41" facs="tcp:104314:34"/> in his name; and
that from that time forward, the Bull could have no further operation, since
the ground upon which it was granted, which was the King's desire, did then
cease, any pretended desire before he was of Age being clearly annulled and
determined by that Protestation after he was of Age, so that a subsequent
Marriage founded upon the Bull must needs be void.</p>
            <p>These were the grounds upon which the Canonists advised the
Process at <hi>Rome</hi> to be carried on. But first to amuse or over-reach the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

<hi>Spain</hi> to silence the noise that was made about it in that Court.
Whether the King had then resolved on the Person that should Succeed the Queen,
when he had obtained what he desired, or not, is much questioned. Some suggest
that from the beginning he was taken with the charmes of <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi>
and that all this Process was moved by the unseen spring of that secret
affection. Others will have this Amour to have been later in the King's
thoughts. How early it came there, as this distance it is not easie to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I know it is not the work of an Historian to refute the Lies of
others, but rather to deliver such a plain account as will be a more effectual
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, than any thing can be that is said by way of Argument, which
belongs to other Writers. And at the end of this King's Reign, I intend to set
down a Collection of the most Notorious False-hoods of that Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104314:35"/> together with the evidences of their being so. But all
this of <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi> is so palpable a lie, or rather a complicated heap
of lies, and so much depends on it, that I presume it will not offend the
Reader to be detained a few minutes in the refutation of it. For if it were
true, very much might be drawn from it, both to disparage King <hi>Henry,</hi>
who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Conscience to annul his Marriage for the nearness of Affinity,
and yet would after that Marry his own Daughter. It leaves also a foul and
lasting stain both on the Memory of <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi> and of her
incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Daughter Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> It also derogates so much from
the first Reformers, who had some kind of dependence on Queen <hi>Anne
Boleyn,</hi> that it seems to be of great importance for directing the Reader
in the judgment he is to make of persons and things, to lay open the falshood
of this account. It were sufficient for blasting it, that there is no proof
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be brought for any part of it, but a Book of one <hi>Rastall</hi>
a Judg, that was never seen by any other person than that Writer. The Title of
the Book is The Life of Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>: there is great reason to
think that <hi>Rastall</hi> never writ any such Book, for it is most common for
the Lives of great Authors to be prefixed to their Works. Now this
<hi>Rastall</hi> publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all <hi>More's</hi> Works in Queens <hi>Maries</hi>
Reign, to which if he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Life, it is likely he would have prefixt
it. No evidence therefore being given for his Relation, either from Record,
Letters, or the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of any person who was privy to the matter, the whole
is to be looked upon as a black Forgery, devised on purpose to defame Queen
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi> For upon her Mothers death, who can doubt but that some,
either to flatter the King, or to defame her, would have published these
things, which if they had been true, could be no secrets? For a Lady of her
Mothers condition to bear a Child, two years after her Husband was sent out of
<hi>England</hi> on such a publick Employment, and a Process there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to be
entred in the Arch-Bishops Courts, are things that are not so soon to be
forgotten. And that she her self was under so ill a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, both in her
Father's Family, and in <hi>France,</hi> for common lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and for being
the Kings Concubin, are things that could not lie hid. And yet when the Books
of the Arch-Bishops Courts (which are now burnt) were extant, it was published
to the world, and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered to every one that would take the pains
to inform themselves,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anti-San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus.</hi>
               </note> that
there was no such thing on Record. Nor did any of the Writers of that time,
either of the Imperial or Papal side, once mention these things,
notwithstanding their great occasion to do it. But 80 years after, this Fable
was invented, or at least it was then first published, when it was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to
lie, because none who had lived in the time could disprove it.</p>
            <p>But it has not only no foundation, but <hi>Sanders</hi> through
the vulgar errors of Liars, has strained his wit to make so ill a story of the
Lady, that some things in his own relation, make it plainly appear to be
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. For to pass by those many improbable things that he relates, as
namely, That both the King of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King,
could be so taken with so ugly and monstrous a Woman, of so notorious and lewd
manners; and that this King, for the space of Seven years, that is, during the
Suit of the Divorce, should continue enamoured of her, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver discover
this, or having discovered it, should yet resolve at all hazards to make her
his Wife; which are things that would require no common testimony to make them
seem credible: There is beside in that story, an <pb n="43" facs="tcp:104314:35"/> heap of
things so inconsistent with one another,<note place="margin">1501.</note> that
none but such an one as <hi>Sanders</hi> could have had either blindness or
brow enough to have made or publisht it. For first, if the King, that he might
the more freely enjoy Sir <hi>Thomas Boleyn's</hi> Lady, sent him over into
<hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Sanders</hi> says, I shall allow it as soon as may be,
that it was in the very beginning of his Reign 1509. Then the time when
<hi>Anne Boleyn</hi> was born, being according to <hi>Sanders</hi> his account
two years after, that must be <hi>Anno</hi> 1511. and being, as he says,
deflowred when she was 15. that must be <hi>Anno</hi> 1526. Then some time must
be allowed for her going to <hi>France,</hi> for her living privately there for
some time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for her coming to Court, and meriting those
Characters that he says went upon her; and after all that, for her return into
<hi>England,</hi> and insinuating her self into the Kings favour: yet by
<hi>Sanders</hi> his own Relation these things must have happened in the same
year 1526. for in that year he makes the King think of putting away his Wife in
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Marry <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi> when according to his account she could
be but 15. years old, though this King had sent Sir <hi>Thomas Boleyn</hi> into
<hi>France</hi> the first day of his coming to the Crown. But that he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>as not sent so early appears by
several Grants, that I have seen in the Rolls, which were made to him in the
first 4 years of the Kings Reign: They sufficiently shew that he was all that
while about the Kings person, and mention no services beyond Sea, but about the
Kings person, as the ground upon which they were made. Besides, I find in the
<hi>Treaty-Rolls</hi> no mention of his being Ambassador the first 8 years of
the Kings Reign. In the first year the Bishops of <hi>Winchester</hi> and
<hi>Duresme,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

<hi>France,</hi> and when overtures were made for a Peace, it appears by the

Ambassador. And when the Kings sister was sent over to <hi>Lewis</hi> the

               </note>
he was not then so much considered as to be made an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. For in the

that must be done when the Prince himself was not 14 years of Age: so they must

this foul Fiction, and go to deliver certain Truths· <hi>Anne
Boleyn's</hi> Mother was Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and Sister
to the Duke that was at the time of the Divorce Lord Treasurer.<note place="margin">Her Birth.</note> Her Fathers Mother was one of the Daughters and
heirs to the Earl of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> and <hi>Ormond,</hi> and her great
Grand-Father Sir <hi>Geofry Boleyn,</hi> who had been Lord Major of
<hi>London,</hi> Married one of the Daughters and Heirs of the Lord
<hi>Hastings</hi>; and their Family as they had mixed with so much great Blood,
so had Married their Daughters to very Noble Families. She being but seven
years old was carried over to <hi>France</hi> with the Kings Sister,<note place="margin">1514.</note>
which shews she could have none of those deformities in her person, since such
are not brought into the Courts and Families of Queens. And though upon the
<hi>French</hi> Kings Death the Queen Dowager came soon back to
<hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">and Breeding.</note> yet she was so lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Dutchess of <hi>Alenson,</hi> kept her in her Court all the while she was
in <hi>France</hi>; which as it shews there was somewhat extraordinary in her
person, so those Princesses being much celebrated for their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, it is not

               </note>When she came into <hi>England</hi> is not so clear:
it is said that in the year 1522. when War was made on <hi>France,</hi> her
Father who was then Ambassador was recalled, and brought her over with him,
which is not improbable; but if she came then, she did not stay long in
<hi>England,</hi> for <hi>Camden</hi> says, that she served Queen
<hi>Claudia</hi> of <hi>France</hi> till her death (which was in <hi>Iuly</hi>
1524) and after that she was taken into service by K <hi>Francis</hi> his
Sister. How long she continued in that service I do not find, but it is
probable that she returned out of <hi>France</hi> with her Father from his
Embassy in the year 1527. when, as <hi>Stow</hi> says, he brought with him the
Picture of her Mistress, who was offered in Marriage to this King. If she came
out of <hi>France</hi> before, as those Authors before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
appears that the King had no design upon her then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he suffered her to
return, and when one Mistress died to take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>France</hi>; but if
she stayed there all this while, then it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he had not seen her till
now at last, when she came out of the Princess of <hi>Alenson's</hi> service:
but whensoever it was that she came to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> it is
certain that she was much considered in it. And though the Queen, who had taken
her to be one of her Maids of Honour, had afterwards just cause to be
displeased with her as her Rival; yet she carried her self so, that in the
whole Progress of the Sute, I never find the Queen her self, or any of her
Agents, fix the least ill Character on her, which would most certainly have
been done had there been any just cause or good colour for it.</p>

<hi>Piercy</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northumberland's</hi> eldest Son, whom his
Father, by a strange compliance with the Cardinals vanity, had placed in his
Court and made him one of his servants. The thing is considerable, and clears
many things that belong to this History; and the Relator of it was an
Ear-witness of the Discourse upon it as himself informs us.<note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <q>The Cardinal hearing that the Lord <hi>Piercy</hi> was making
  addresses <pb n="45" facs="tcp:104314:36"/> to <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1527.</note> one day as he came from the Court called for him
  before his servants (<hi>before us all</hi> says the Relator <hi>including
  himself</hi>) and chid him for it, pretending at first that it was unworthy of
  him to match so meanly; but he justified his choice, and reckoned up her birth
  and Quality, which he said was not inferior to his own. And the Cardinal
  insisting fiercely, to make him lay down his pretensions, he told him, he would
  willingly submit to the King and him; but that he had gone so far before many
  witnesses, that he could not forsake it, and knew not how to discharge his
  conscience: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he entreated the Cardinal would procure him the
  Kings favour in it. Upon that the Cardinal in great rage said, why? thinkest
  thou that the King and I know not what we have to do in so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a matter?
  yes I warrant you, but I can see in thee no submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at all to the purpose:
  and said, you have matched your self with such a one, as neither the King, nor
  yet your Father will agree to it; and therefore I will send for thy Father, who
  at his coming shall either make thee break this unadvised bargain, or
  disinherit thee for ever. To which the Lord <hi>Piercy</hi> replyed, That he
  would submit himself to him, if his Conscience were discharged of the weighty
  burden that lay upon it, and soon after, his Father coming to Court he was
  diverted another way.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Had that Writer told us in what year this was done, it had given a
great light to direct us, but by this relation we see that she was so far from
thinking of the King at that time, that she had engaged her self another way;
but how far this went on her side, or whether it was afterwards made use of,
when she was divorced from the King, shall be considered in its proper place.
It also appears that there was a Design about her then formed between the King
and the Cardinal, yet how far that went, whether to make her Queen, or only to
Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her, is not evident. It is said,<note place="margin">L.
  <hi>Herbert.</hi>
               </note> that upon this she ever after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Cardinal, and
that he never designed the Divorce after he saw on whom the King had fixed his
thoughts: but all that is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, as will afterwards appear.</p>

               </note> The King resolving to put the matter home to

  Assurances of Rewards to engage him to follow the Business very vigorously, and
  with great Diligence, he writes that he had before opened the Kings case to
  him, and that partly by his own study, partly by the opinion of many Divines,
  and other Learned men of all sorts, he found that <pb n="46" facs="tcp:104314:37"/> he could
  no longer with a good Conscience continue in that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Queen:
  having God and the Quiet and Salvation of his Soul chiefly before his eyes. And
  that he had consulted both the most Learned Divines and Canonists, as well in
  his own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as elsewhere, to know whether the Popes Dispensation could
  make it good, and that many of them thought the Pope could not Dispence in this
  case of the first degree of Affinity, which they esteemed forbidden by a
  Divine, Moral; and Natural Law; and all the rest concluded, that the Pope could
  not do it, but upon very weighty reasons: and they found not any such in the
  Bull. Then he lays out the reasons for Annulling the Bull which were touched
  before, upon which they all concluded the Dispensation to be of no force; that
  the King looked on the death of his Sons as a Curse from God: and to avoid
  further Judgments, he now desired help of the Apostolick See, to consider his
  case, to reflect on what he had merited by these Services he had done the
  Papacy, and to find a way that he being divorced from his Queen may Marry
  ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wife, of whom by the blessing of God he might hope for is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue Male.
  Therefore the Ambassador was to use all means possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be admitted to speak
  to the Pope in Private, and then to deliver him these Letters of Credence, in
  which there was a most earnest Clause added with the Kings own hand. He was
  also to make a Condoleance of the Miseries the Pope and Cardinals were in, both
  in the Kings name and the Cardinals, and to assure the Pope they would use all
  the most effectual means that were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for setting him at Liberty, in
  which the Cardinal would Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy as much Industry, as if there were no other
  way to come to the Kingdom of Heaven but by doing it. Then he was to open the
  Kings business to the Pope, the Scruples of his Conscience, the great danger of
  cruel Wars upon so disputable a Succession, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of all the Nobility
  and the whole Kingdom, with many other urgent reasons, to obtain what was
  desired. He was also to lay before the Pope the present condition of
  Christendome and of <hi>Italy,</hi> that he might consider of what Importance
  it was to his own affairs, and to the Apostolick See, to engage the King so
  firmly to his Interests as this would certainly do. And to move that the Pope
  without communicating the Matter to any person, would freely grant it, and Sign
  the Commission which was therewith sent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed in due form, and ready to be
  Signed, by which the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was Authorized with the Assistance of such as he
  should choose, to proceed in the Matter, according to some Instructions which
  were also sent fairly written out for the Pope to Sign. A Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation was
  also sent in due form: and if these were expeded, he might assure the Pope that
  as the King had sent over a vast sum to the <hi>French</hi> King, for paying
  his Army in <hi>Italy,</hi> so he would spare no Travel nor Treasure, but make
  War upon the Emperor in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with his whole strength, till he
  forced him to set the Pope at Liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and restore the State of the Church
  to its former Power and Dignity. And if the Pope were already at Liberty, and
  had made an Agreement with the Emperor, he was to represent to him how little
  cause he had to trust much to the Emperor, who <pb n="47" facs="tcp:104314:37"/> had so oft
  broke his faith, and designed to do all he could towards the Depressing the
  Ecclesiastical State. And the Pope was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that he had dispenced
  with the Emperors Oath, for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Kings Daughter without communicating
  the Matter to the King. And if he had done so much for one that had been his
  Enemy, how much more might the King expect the like favour, who had always
  payed him a most filial Duty? Or if the Pope would not grant the Commission to
  the Cardinal to try the Matter, as a Person that being the Kings chief
  Minister, was not indifferent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to judge in any of the Kings Concerns; he
  was by all means to overcome that, and assure the Pope that he would proceed in
  it as a Judge ought to do. But if the Pope stood upon it, and would by no means
  be perswaded to sign the Commission for the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, then he was to propose
  <hi>Staphileus,</hi> Dean of the <hi>Rota,</hi> who was then in
  <hi>England</hi>; and was to except against all other Forreigners, if the Pope
  chanced to propose any other. He was also to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Pope, that the
  King would look upon a delay as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and if the Pope inclined to consult
  with any of the Cardinals about it, he was to divert him from it all that was
  possible: but if the Pope would needs do it, then he was to Address himself to
  them, and partly by informing them of the reasons of the Kings Cause, partly by
  rewarding the good Offices they should do, he was to engage them for the King.
  And with this Dispatch Letters were sent to Cardinal <hi>Puccy, Sanctorum
  Quatuor,</hi> and the other Cardinals, to be made use of as there should be
  occasion for it. And because Money was like to be the most powerful Argument,
  especially to men impoverished by a Captivity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10000 Ducats were remit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  for it, which the King would faithfully make good; and in particular, they were
  to be wanting in nothing, that might absolutely engage the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Datary to
  favour the Kings Business.</q>

he had by corrupting some of his Guards sent him the Sum of the Kings Demands.

Ambassador went to him to <hi>Orvieto</hi> about the end of <hi>December,</hi>
and first did in the Kings and Cardinals name congratulate his freedom. Then
the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary discoursed the Business. The Pope owned that he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Message which he had sent to him at <hi>Rome,</hi> but in respect of his
Promise, and that yet in a manner he was in Captivity, he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King would
have a little Patience, and he should before long have not only that
Dispensation, but any thing else that lay in his <pb n="48" facs="tcp:104314:38"/> Power.
But the Secretary not being satisfied with that excuse, the Pope in the end
said, he should have it; but with this condition, That he would beseech the
King not to proceed upon it, till the Pope were fully at Liberty, and the
<hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> were driven out of <hi>Italy.</hi> And
upon the Kings promising this, the Dispensation was to be put in his hands. So
the Secretary, who had a great mind once to have the Bull in his possession,
made no scruple to engage his promise for that. The Pope also told them he was
not expert in those things, but he easily apprehended the danger that might
arise from any Dispute about the Succession to the Crown, and that therefore he
would communicate the business to the Cardinal <hi>Sanctorum Quatuor</hi>; upon
which they resolved to prevent that Cardinals being with the Pope, and went and
delivered the Letters they had for him, and promised him a good reward if he
were favourable to their Requests in the Kings behalf. Then they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him
the Commissions that were sent from <hi>England</hi>; but he upon the perusal
of them, said, They could not pass without a perpetual disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on the Pope
and the King too, and excepted to several Clauses that were in them. So they
desired him to draw one that might both be sufficient for the Kings purpose,
and such as the Pope might with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour grant. Which being done, the Pope told
them, That though he apprehended great danger to himself, if the Emperour
should know what he had done; yet he would rather expose himself to utter
ruine, than give the King, or the Cardinal cause to think him Ingrate; but with
many sighs and tears,<note place="margin">And being at liberty, gives a Bull for
  it.</note> he begged that the King would not precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate things, or expose him
to be undone, by beginning any Process upon the Bull. And so he delivered the
Commission and Dispensation Signed to <hi>Knight.</hi> But the means that the
Pope proposed for his publishing and owning what he now granted, was, That
<hi>Lau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rech</hi> with the
<hi>French</hi> Army should march,<note place="margin">The Pope's craft &amp;
  policy</note> and coming where the Pope was, should require him to grant the
Commission: So that the Pope should excuse himself to the Emperour, that he had
refused to grant it upon the desire of the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour, but
that he could not deny the General of the <hi>French</hi> Army, to do an act of
publick justice: And by this means he would save his honour, and not seem
guilty of breach of promise; and then he would dispatch the Commission about
the time of <hi>Lautrech</hi>'s being near him, and therefore he entreated the
King to accept of what was then granted for the present. The Commission and
Dispensation was given to the Secretary: and they promised to send the Bull
after him, of the same form that was desired from <hi>England,</hi> and the
Pope engaged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it as should be found needful. And it seems by these
Letters, that a Dispensation and Commission had been Signed by the Pope when he
was a Prisoner; but they thought not fit to make any use of them, lest they
should be thought null, as being granted when the Pope was in Captivity.</p>
            <p>Thus the Pope expressed all the readiness that could be expected
from him,<note place="margin">And the measures that governed them.</note> in the
circumstances he was then in; being over-aw'd by the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists,</hi>
who were harassing the Country, and taking Castles very near the place where he
was. <hi>Lautrech</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> Army lay still fast about
<hi>Bononia,</hi> and as the season of the year was not favourable, so he did
not express any inclinations to enter into action. The Cardinal <hi>Sanctorum
Quatuor</hi> got 4000 Crowns as the reward of his pains, and in 
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104314:38"/> earnest of what he was to expect when the matter should be
brought to a final conclusion.<note place="margin">1528.</note> In this whole
matter the Pope carried himself as a wise and politick Prince, that considered
his Interest, and provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst dangers with great fore-sight. But as for
Apostolical wisdom, and the Simplicity of the Gospel, that was not to be
expected from him. For now, though the high-sounding names of <hi>Christs
Vicar,</hi> and St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Successor,</hi> were still retained to keep up
the Popes Dignity and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, yet they had for many Ages governed
themselves as Secular Princes; so that the Maximes of that Court were no more
to keep a good Conscience, and to proceed according to the Rules of the Gospel,
and the Practice of the Primitive Church, committing the event to God, and
submitting to his Will in all things: but the keeping a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, the
maintaining their Interest in the Courts of Princes, the secur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their
Dominions, and the raising their Families, being that which they chiefly looked
at, It is not to be wondered at, that the Pope go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned himself by these
measures, though Religion was to be made use of to help him out of straits. All
this I set down the more particularly, both because I take my information from
Original Letters, and that it may chiefly appear how matters went at that time
in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secretary <hi>Knight</hi> being Infirme, could not travel with
that haste that was required in this business, and therefore he sent the
Proto-Notary <hi>Gambara</hi> with the Commission and Dispensation to
<hi>England,</hi> and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in easie journies. The Cardinals that had been
consulted with,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> did
all express great readiness in granting the Kings desire. The Cardinal
<hi>Datary</hi> had forsaken the Court, and betaken himself to serve God and
his Cure; and other Cardinals were Hostages, so that now there were but Five
about the Pope, <hi>Monte, Sanctorum Quatuor, Ridolphi, Ravennate</hi> and
<hi>Perusino.</hi> But a motion being made of sending over a Legate, the Pope
would by no means hearken to it, for that would draw new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles on him from
the Emperor. That had been desired from <hi>England</hi> by a dispatch of the
27th. of <hi>December,</hi> which pressed a speedy conclusion of the business;
upon which the Pope on the 12th. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the
matter under the Seal of Confession to the Cardinals <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum
Quatuor</hi> and <hi>Simoneta,</hi>
               <note place="margin"> 
                  <p>The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Pope.</p>

               </note> (who was then come to
the Court) and upon conference with them, he proposed to Sir <hi>Gregory
Cassali,</hi> that he thought the safer way was, 
<q>That either by vertue of the Commission that the Secretary had
  obtained, or by the Legantine Power that was lodged with the Cardinal of
  <hi>York,</hi> he should proceed in the business. And if the King found the
  matter clear in his own Conscience, (in which the Pope said, No doctor in the
  whole world could resolve the matter beter than the King himself) he should
  without more noise, make judgment be given; and presently Marry another Wife,
  and then send for a Legate to Confirm the matter. And it would be easier to
  ratifie all when it was once done, than to go on in a Process from
  <hi>Rome.</hi> For the Queen would protest, that both the Place and the Judges
  were suspected and not free, upon which, in the course of Law, the Pope must
  grant an Inhibition for the Kings not Marrying another while the Suit depended,
  and must avocate the business to be heard in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; which,
  with other prejudices, were unavoidable in a publick Process by Bulls from
  <hi>Rome.</hi> But if the thing went on in <pb n="50" facs="tcp:104314:39"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> and the King had once Married another Wife, the Pope then
  would find very good reasons to justifie the conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rming a thing that was gone so far, and promised to send
  any Cardinal whom they should name.</q> This the Pope desired the Ambassadour
would signifie to the King, as the advice of the two Cardinals, and take no
notice of him in it. But the dispatch shews he was a more faithful Minister
than to do so.</p>
            <p>The Ambassadour found all the earnestness in the Pope that was
pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to comply with the King; and that he was jealous both of the
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and <hi>Francis,</hi> and depended wholly on the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that
he found if the terror of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Forces were over, the Court of
<hi>England</hi> would dispose of the Apostolical See as they pleased. And
indeed this advice, how little soever it had of the Simplicity of the Gospel,
was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prudent and subtile, and that which of all things the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended most. And therefore the <hi>General of the
Observants</hi> moved Cardinal <hi>Campegius,</hi> then at <hi>Rome,</hi> for
an Inhibition, lest the Process should be carried on and determined in
<hi>England.</hi> But that being signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the Pope, he said, It could not
be granted, since there was no Suit depending, in which case only an Inhibition
can be granted.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Staphileus</hi> sent from

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>But now I must look over again to
<hi>England,</hi> to open the Counsels there. At that time <hi>Staphileus</hi>
Dean of the <hi>Rota</hi> was there; and he either to make his Court the
better, or that he was so perswaded in opinion, seemed fully satisfied about
the Justice of the King's Cause. So they sent him to <hi>Rome</hi> with
Instructions both publick and secret. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Instructions related to the
Popes Affairs, in which all possible As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance was promised by the King. But
one Proposition in them flowed from the Cardinals Ambition, 
<q>That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> thought
  it would advance the Popes Interests,<note place="margin">His
 Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> if he should command the Cardinals that were under no
  restraint, to meet in some secure place, to consider of the Affairs of the
  Church,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cotton.</hi> Libr. <hi>Vitel.</hi> B. 10.
 <hi>Ian.</hi> 8.</note> that they might suffer no prejudice by the Popes
  Captivity: And for that end, and to conserve the Dignity of the Apostolick See,
  that they should choose such a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car or President, as partly by his Prudence
  and Courage, partly by the assistance of the two Kings,<note place="margin">Duplicates corrected by the Cardinal's Hand.</note> upon whom
  depended all their hopes, might do such Services to the Apostolick See, as were
  most necessary in that distracted time, by which the Popes Liberty would be
  hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be imagined but the Pope would be offended with this
Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and apprehend that the Cardinal of <hi>York</hi> was not
satisfied to be intriguing for the Popedom after his death, but was aspiring to
it while he was alive. For as it was plain, he was the Person that must be
cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen for that trust; so if the Pope were used hardly by the Emperour, and
forced to ill conditions, the Vicar so chosen and his Cardinals would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
those Conditions, which might end in a Schism or his Deposition. But
<hi>Staphileus</hi> his secret Instructions, related wholly to the Kings
business, which were these: 
<q>That the King had opened to him the error of his Marriage, and
  that the said Bishop out of his great Learning, did now clearly perceive how
  invalid and insufficient it was: Therefore the King recommended it to his care,
  that he would convince the Pope and the Cardinals, with the Arguments that had
  been laid before him, and of which a Breviate was given him. He was also to
  represent the great mischiefs that might follow, if Princes got not justice and
  ease from <pb n="51" facs="tcp:104314:39"/> the Apostolick See. Therefore if the Pope were
  yet in Captivity he was to propose a meeting of the Cardinals, for choosing the
  Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>York</hi> to be their head, during the Popes Imprisonment, or
  that a full Commission might be sent to him for the Kings ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter. And in particular he was to take
  care that the Business might be tryed in <hi>England.</hi> And for his pains in
  promoting the Kings Concerns, the King promised to procure a Bishoprick for him
  in <hi>France</hi>; and to help him to a Cardinals hat.</q> By him the King
wrote to the Pope. The rude draught of it remains under the Cardinals hand,
earnestly desiring a speedy and favourable dispatch of his business with a
Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Bearer.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal also wrote to the Pope by him;<note place="margin">The
  Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Letter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by him.</note>
and after a long Congratulating his Liberty with many sharp reflections on the
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, he pressed a Dispatch of the Kings Business, in which he would not
use many words: this only I will add, <hi>says he,</hi> 
               <q>That that which is desired is holy and just, and very much for
  the safety and quiet of this Kingdom, which is most devoted to the Apostolical
  See. He also wrote by the same hand to the Ambassador, that the King would have
  things so carryed, that all occasion of discontent or cavilling, whether at
  home or abroad, might be removed; and therefore desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that another Cardinal
  might be sent Legate to <hi>England,</hi> and joyned in Commission wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h himself for judging the Matter. He
  named either <hi>Campegius, Tranus,</hi> or <hi>Farnese</hi>: Or if that could
  not be obtained, that a fuller Commission might be sent to himself, with all
  possible haste, since delays might produce great inconveniences. If a Legate
  were named, then care must be taken that he should be one who were Learned,
  Indifferent, and <hi>Tractable</hi>; and if <hi>Campegius</hi> could be the
  man, he was the fittest person. And when one was named he should make him a
  decent present, and assure him that the King would most liberally recompence
  all his labour and expence. He also required him to press his speedy Dispatch,
  and that the Commission should be full to try and determine, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hout any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Sentence
  to be given by the Pope.</q> This Dispatch is interlined, and amended with the
Cardinals own hand.</p>
            <p>But upon the Arrival of the Messenger whom the Secretary had
sent,<note place="margin">A Larger Bull desired by the King.</note> with the
Commission and Dispensation, and the other Packets before mentioned; It was
debated in the Kings Council, whether he should go on in his Process, or
continue to solicite new Bulls from <hi>Rome.</hi> On the one hand, they saw
how tedious, dangerous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive a Process at <hi>Rome</hi> was like to
prove: and therefore it seemed the easiest and most expedite way to proceed
before the Cardinal in his Legantine Court, who should <hi>ex officio,</hi> and
in the Summary way of their Court, bring it to a speedy Conclusion. But on the
other hand, if the Cardinal gave Sentence, and the King should Marry, then they
were not sure, but before that time the Pope might either change his mind, or
his Interest might turn him another way. And the Popes Power was so absolute by
the Canon Law, that no general Clauses in Commissions to Legates, could bind
him to confirm their Sentences: and if upon the Kings Marrying another Wife,
the Pope should refuse to confirm it, then the King would be in a worse case
than he was now in, and his Marriage and Issue by it should be still 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104314:40"/> disputable: Therefore they thought this was by no means to
be adventured on, but they should make new Addresses to the Court of
<hi>Rome.</hi> In the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, some sharp words fell either from the King, or
some of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Counsellors;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gardiner</hi> and
  <hi>Fox</hi> sent to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> Intimating that if the Pope
continued under such fears, the King must find some other way to set him at
ease. So it was resolved that <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> commonly called Doctor
<hi>Stevens,</hi> the Cardinals chief Secretary, and <hi>Edward Fox</hi> the
Kings Almoner, should be sent to <hi>Rome</hi>; the one being esteemed the
ablest Canonist in <hi>England,</hi> the other one of the best Divines, they
were Dispatched the 10th of <hi>February.</hi>
               <note place="margin">With Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
  from the King,</note> 
               <q> 
                  <p>By them the King wrote to the Pope thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that he had
  expressed such forward and earnest willingness to give him ease: and had so
  kindly promised to gratifie his desires, of which he expected now to see the

  the Cardinals, his thanks for the chearfulness with which they had in

  was in some fear that if he could not bring about the Kings desires,<note place="margin"> 
                        <p>and the Cardinal.</p>

                     </note> he was like to lose
  his favour.</p> 
                  <p>He besought the Pope as lying at his feet, that if he thought
  him a Christian, a good Cardinal, and not unworthy of that Dignity, an useful
  mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Apostolick See, a Promoter of Justice and Equity, or thought him
  his faithful Creature, or that he desired his own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, that he
  would now so far consider his Intercession, as to grant kindly and speedily
  that which the King earnestly desired; which if he did not know to be Holy,
  Right, and Just, he would undergo any hazard or punishment whatsoever, rather
  than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it; but he did aprehend if the King found that the Pope was so
  overawed by the Emperor, as not to grant that which all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom judged was
  grounded both on the Divine and Human Laws, both he and other Christian Princes
  would from thence take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to provide themselves of other Remedies, and
  lessen and despise the Authority of the Apostolick See.<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9th.</note>
                  </p>
               </q> In his Letters to
<hi>Cassali</hi> he expressed a great sense of the Services which the Cardinal
<hi>Sanctorum Quatuor</hi> had done the King; and bid him enquire what were the
things in which he delighted most, whether Furniture, Gold plate, or Horses,
that they might make him acceptable presents; and assure him that the King
would contribute largely towards the carrying on the building of St.
<hi>Peters</hi> in the <hi>Vatican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most Important thing about which they were employed, was to
procure the expediting of a Bull which was formed in <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin"> 
                  <p>The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Bull desired by them.</p>

               </note> with all the
strongest Clauses that could be imagined. In the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of which all the
Reasons against the validity of the Bull of <hi>P. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the 2d, were
recited: and it was also hinted 
<q>
                  <hi>that it was against the Law of God</hi>; but to lessen that,
  it was added, <hi>at least where there was not a sufficient Dispensation
  obtained:</hi> therefore the Pope, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the great Services by which the
  King had obliged the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick See, and having regard to the Distractions
  that might follow on a Disputable Title; upon a full Consultation with the
  Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, having also heard the Opinions of Divines and Canonists,
  Deputed—for his Legate, to concur with the Cardinal of <hi>York,</hi>
  ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together, or (the one being hindred, or unwilling) severally.</q> 
               <q>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:104314:40"/>And if they found those things that were
  suggested against the Bull of <hi>P. Iulius,</hi> or any of them, well or
  sufficiently proved,<note place="margin">1527.</note> then to declare it void and
  null, as surreptitiously procured, upon false grounds; and thereupon to Annul
  the Marriage that had followed upon it: And to give both Parties full leave to
  Marry again, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any Appellation or Protestation, the Pope making
  them his Vicars, with full and absolute Power and Authority: empowering them
  also to declare the Issue begotten in the former Marriage good and legitimate,
  if they saw cause for it. The Pope binding himself to confirm whatever they
  should do in that process, and never to revoke or repeal what they should
  Pronounce. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring also that this Bull should remain in force till the
  Process were ended, and that by no Revocation or Inhibition it should be
  recalled; and if any such were obtained, these are all declared void and null,
  and the Legats were to proceed notwithstanding: and all ended with a full
  <hi>Non obstante.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This was judged the uttermost force that could be in a Bull:
Though the Civilians would scarce allow any validity at all in these
extravagant Clauses: but the most material thing in this Bull, is, that it
seems the King was not fully resolved to declare his Daughter illegitimate.
Whether he pretended this, to mitigate the Queens, or the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors opposition,
or did really intend it, is not clear. But what he did afterwards in
Parliament, shews, he had this deep in his thoughts, though the Queens Carriage
did soon after provoke him to pursue his resentments against her Daughter. The
French King did also joyn a most earnest Letter of his to the Pope, which they
were also to deliver. They had likewise a secret Instruction by all means to
endeavour that Cardinal <hi>Campegio</hi> should be the Legate, he had the
reputation of a Learned Canonist, and they knew he was a <hi>tractable
man</hi>: and besides that, he was Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the King had

               </note> that was the
Ambassadors Brother. In which all the Arguments that a most anxious mind could
invent or dictate, are laid together to perswade the Pope to grant the Kings
desires. Among other things he tells him, 
<q>How he had engaged to the King, that the Pope would not deny it;
  That the King both out of scruple of Conscience, and because of some Diseases
  in the Queen, that were incurable, had resolved never to come near her more;
  and that if the Pope continued, out of his partial respects to the Emperor, to
  be inexorable, the King would proceed another way.</q> He offers to take all
the blame of it upon his own Soul, if it were amiss; with many other
particulars in which he is so pressing, that I cannot imagine what moved the
Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> who saw those Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to think that the Cardinal did
not really intend the Divorce. He (it seems) saw another Paper of their
Instructions, by which they were ordered to say to the Pope, that the Cardinal
was not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Counsel. But all that was intended by that, was only
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104314:41"/> to excuse him so far, that he might not be thought too
partial, and an incompetent Judge. For as he was far from disowning the justice
of the Kings Sute, so he would not have trusted a Secret of that Importance to
paper, which when it should be known to the King, would have lost him his
favour. But undoubtedly it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed between the King and him to remove an
Exception, which otherwise the Cardinals of the Imperial Faction would have
made, to his being the Judg in that matter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.</note>With those
Letters and Instructions were <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Fox</hi> sent to
<hi>Rome,</hi> where both the <hi>Cassalies</hi> and <hi>Staphileus</hi> were
promoting the Kings business all they could. And being strengthned with the
Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of those other two they made a greater progress; so that in
<hi>April</hi> the Pope did in Consistory,<note place="margin"> 
                  <p>
                     <hi>Campegio</hi> declared Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</p>

               </note> Declare Cardinal
<hi>Campegio</hi> Legate to go to <hi>England,</hi> that he with the Cardinal
of <hi>York</hi> might try the validity of the Kings Marriage: But that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Cardinal made great excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he was then Legate at <hi>Rome,</hi> in which he
had such advantages, that he had no mind to enter in a business which must for
ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage either the Emperor or the King against him. He also pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an
Inability to travel so great a journey, being much subject to the Gout. But
when this was known in <hi>England,</hi> the Cardinal wrote him a most earnest
Letter,<note place="margin"> 
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wolsey</hi> writes to him to haste over.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 7.</p>
               </note> to hasten over, and bring with him
all such things as were necessary for making their Sentence firm and
ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reversible, so that it might never again be Questioned.</p>
            <p>But here I shall add a Remark, which though it is of no great
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, yet will be diverting to the Reader. The draught of the Letter is
in <hi>Wolsey's</hi> Secretaries hand, amended in some places by his own; and
concluded thus, <hi>I hope all things shall be done according to the Will of
God, the desire of the King, the Quiet of the Kingdom, and to our honour with a
good Conscience.</hi> But the Cardinal dasht out this last word <hi>with a good
Conscience.</hi> Perhaps judging that was a thing fit for mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er persons, but
that it was below the Dignity of two Cardinals to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it much. He wrote
also to <hi>Cassali</hi> high complements for his diligence in the Step that
was made, but desired him with all possible means to get the Bull granted and
trusted to his keeping, with the deepest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, that no use should be
made of it, but that the King only should see it; by which his mind would be at
ease, and he being put in good hopes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would employ his Power in the
service of the Pope and Apostolick See: but the Pope was not a man to be
cozen'd so easily.</p>
            <p>When the Cardinal heard by the next Dispatch what excuses and
delays <hi>Campegio</hi> made,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>May</hi> 23.</note> he
wrote to him again, and pressed his coming over in haste. 
<q>For his being Legate of <hi>Rome</hi> he desired him to name a
  Vice-Legate. For his want of Money and Horses, <hi>Gardiner</hi> would furnish
  him as he desired, and he should find an equipage ready for him in
  <hi>France</hi>; and he might certainly expect great rewards from the King. But
  if he did not make more haste, the King would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to believe an
  advertisement that was sent him, of his turning over to the Emperors Party.
  Therefore if he either valued the Kings kindness, or were grateful for the
  favours he had received from him; if he valued the Cardinals Friendship or
  safety, or if he would hinder the diminution of the Authority of the Roman
  Church, all excuses set aside, he must make what haste in his Journey was
  pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</q> 
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104314:41"/> Yet the Legate made no great haste, for
till <hi>October</hi> following he came not into <hi>England.</hi> The Bull
that was desired could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but another was granted, which perhaps
was of more force because it had not those extraordinary Clauses in it.<note place="margin">

There is the Copy of a Bull to this purpose in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library,
which has been printed more than once by some that have taken it for a Copy of
the same Bull that was sent by <hi>Campegio</hi>: but I take it to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a Copy of that Bull which the Pope Signed at <hi>Rome</hi> while he was there a
Prisoner, and probably afterward at <hi>Orvieto</hi> he might give it the date
that it bears 1527. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 17. But that there was a Decretal Bull
sent by <hi>Campegio</hi> will appear evidently in the sequel of this Relation.
About this time I meet with the first evidence of the progress of the Kings
love to <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi> in two Original Letters of hers to the Cardinal,
from which it appears, not only that the King had then resolved to Marry her,
but that the Cardinal was privy to it. They bear no date, but the matter of
them shews they were written after the end of <hi>May,</hi> when the
Sweating-sickness began, and about the time that the Legate was expected. They
give such a light to the History, that I shall not cast them over to the
Collection at the end, but set them down here.</p>

               <note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14th.</note>The
Cardinal hearing that <hi>Campegius</hi> had the Decretal Bull commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to
his Trust, to be shewed only to the King and himself, wrote to the Ambassador
that it was necessary it should be also shewed to some of the Kings Council;
not to make any use of it, but that thereby they might understand how to manage
the Process better by it. This he begged might be trusted to his care and
fidelity, and he undertook to manage it so, that no kind of danger could arise
out of it.</p>
            <p>At this time the Cardinal having Finished his Foundations at
<hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Ipswich,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's
  Colledges finished.</note> and finding they were very acceptable, both to the
King and to the Clergy, resolved to go on, and suppress more Monasteries, and
erect new Bishopricks, turning some Abbies to Cathedrals. This was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in
the Consistory,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Octob.</hi> 30.</note> and granted, as
appears by a dispatch of <hi>Cassali's.</hi> He also spoke to the Pope about a
general Visitation of all Monasteries. And on the 4th of <hi>November,</hi> the
Bull for suppressing some was expected, a Copy whereof is yet extant, but
written in such a hand, that I could not read three words together in any place
of it; and though I tried others that were good at reading all hands, yet they
could not do it. But I find by the dispatch that the Pope did it with some
aversion: and when <hi>Gardiner</hi> told him plainly,<note place="margin">More
  Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries were to be suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> 
               <hi>it was necessary and it must be
done,</hi> he paused a little, and seemed unwilling to give any further offence
to Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: But since he found it so uneasie to gratifie the King in
so great a Point, as the matter of his Divorce, he judged it the more necessary
to mollifie him by a compliance in all other things. So there was a power given
to the Two Legates to examine the state of the Monasteries, and to suppress
such as they thought fit, and convert them into Bishopricks and Cathedrals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:104314:42"/>While matters went thus between <hi>Rome</hi>
and <hi>England,</hi> the Queen was as active as she could be, to engage her

  the Kings suit.</note> She complained to them much of the King, but more of the
Cardinal: She also gave them notice of all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions that were made to
the Bull, and desired both their advice and assistance: They having a mind to
perplex the Kings Affairs, advised her by no means to yield, nor to be induced
to enter into a Religious life; and gave her assurance, that by their Interest
at <hi>Rome,</hi> they would support her, and maintain her Daughters Title, if
it went to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And as they employed all their agents at <hi>Rome</hi>
to serve her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, so they consulted with the Canonists about the force of
the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to the Bull. The issue of which was, that a <hi>Breve</hi> was
found out, or forged, that supplied some of the most material defects in the
Bull. For whereas in the Bull, the Preamble bore, that the King and Queen had
desired the Popes Dispensation to Marry, that the Peace might continue between
the Two Crowns without any other cause given: In the preamble of this
<hi>Breve,</hi>
               <note place="margin"> 
                  <p>A <hi>Breve</hi> found out in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p>Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15th.</p>
               </note> mention is made of
their desire to Marry, 
<q>because otherwise it was not likely that the Peace would be
  continued between the Two Crowns. </q>And for that, and divers other reasons
they asked the Dispensation. Which in the body of the <hi>Breve</hi> is
granted, bearing date the 26th of <hi>December,</hi> 1503. Upon this they
pretended that the Dispensation was granted upon good Reasons; since by this
Petition it appeared, that there were fears of a Breach between the Crowns: And
that there were also other reasons made use of, though they were not named. But
there was one Fatal thing in it. In the Bull it is only said, That the Queens
Petition bore, <hi>That perhaps she had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated her Marriage with
Prince</hi> Arthur, <hi>by the Carnalis Copula.</hi> But in this
<hi>perhaps</hi> is left out, and 'tis plainly said, <hi>That they had
Consummated their Marriage.</hi> This the King's Council, who suspected that
the <hi>Breve</hi> was forged, made great use of when the Question was argued,
whether Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> knew her or not? Though at this time 'twas said,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did put it in on design, knowing it was like to be
proved, that the former Marriage was Consummated: which they intended to throw
out of the debate, since by this it appeared that the Pope did certainly know
that, and yet granted the <hi>Breve</hi>; and that therefore there was to be no
more enquiry to be made into that, which was already confessed: so that all
that was now to be debated, was the Popes power of granting such a
Dispensation, in which they had good reason to expect a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Decision at
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there appeared great grounds to reject this <hi>Breve</hi> as
a forged writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note place="margin">Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forged.</note>
It was neither in the Records of <hi>England,</hi> nor <hi>Spain,</hi> but said
to be found among the Papers of <hi>D. de Puebla,</hi> that had been the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador in <hi>England</hi> at the time of concluding the
Match. So that if he only had it, it must have been cassated, otherwise the
Parties concerned would have got it into their hands: Or else it was forged
since. Many of the names were written false, which was a presumption that it
was lately made by some <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who knew not how to write the names
true. For <hi>Sigismund,</hi> who was Secretary, when it was pretended to have
been Signed, was an exact man, and no such errors were found in <hi>Breves</hi>
at that time. But that which shewed it a manifest Forgery, was, that it bore
date the 26th of <hi>December, Anno</hi> 1503. on the same day that the 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104314:43"/> Bull was granted. It was not to be imagined that in the
same day a <hi>Bull,</hi> and a <hi>Breve,</hi> should have been expedited in
the same business, with such material differences in them. And the stile of the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had this singularity in it; That in all their
<hi>Breves,</hi> they reckon the beginning of the year from
<hi>Christmas</hi>-day, which being the Nativity of our Lord, they count the
year to begin then. But in their Bulls they reckon the year to begin at the
Feast of the <hi>Annunciation.</hi> So that a <hi>Breve</hi> dated the 26th. of
<hi>December,</hi> 1503. was in the vulgar account in the year, 1502.
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be false; for neither was <hi>Iulius</hi> the 2d. who
granted it, then Pope, nor was the Treaty of the Marriage so far advanced at
that time, as to admit of a <hi>Breve</hi> so soon. But allowing the
<hi>Breve</hi> to be true, they had many of the same Exceptions to it, that
they had to the <hi>Bull,</hi> since it bore that the King desired the
Marriage, to avoid a Breach between the Crowns, which was false. It likewise
bore that the Marriage had been Consummated between the Queen and Prince
<hi>Arthur,</hi> which the Queen denied was ever done; so that the suggestion
in her name being as she said, false, it could have no force, though it were
granted to be a true <hi>Breve</hi>: And they said, it was plain, the
<hi>Imperialists</hi> were convinced the <hi>Bull</hi> was of no force, since
they betook themselves to such arts to fortifie their Cause.</p>

                  <hi>Campegio</hi> comes into

               </note>When Cardinal <hi>Campegio</hi> came to
<hi>England,</hi> he was received with the publick Solemnities ordinary in such
a case, and in his speech at his first Audience, he called the King <hi>the
Deliverer of the Pope, and of the City of Rome,</hi> with the highest
complements that the occasion did require. But when he was admitted to a
private Conference with the King, and the Cardinal, he used many arguments to
diswade the King from prosecuting the matter any further. This the King took
very ill, as if his errand had been rather to confirm than annul his Marriage;
and complained that the Pope had broken his word to him. But the Legate studied
to qualifie him, and shewed the Decretal Bull, by which he might see, that
though the Pope wished rather that the business might come to a more friendly
conclusion;<note place="margin">And showes the King the Bull,</note> yet if the
King could not be brought to that, he was empowered to grant him all that he
desired. But he could not be brought to part with the DecretalBull out of his
hands, or to leave it for a minute, either with the King or the Cardinal:
saying, That it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on these terms, that no other person should see
it; and that <hi>Gardiner</hi> and the Ambassador had only moved to have it
expedited,<note place="margin">But refuses to let it be seen to the
  Council.</note> and sent by the Legate, to let the King see how well the Pope
was affected to him. With all this the King was much dissatisfied; but to
encourage him again, the Legate told him, he was to speak to the Queen in the
Popes name, to induce her to enter into a Religious life, and to make the Vows.
But when he proposed that to her, she answered him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly, that she could
not dispose of her self, but by the advice of her Nephews.</p>
            <p>Of all this the Cardinal of <hi>York</hi> advertised the

                  <hi>Wolsey's</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour at
  <hi>Rome</hi> that it might be showed.</note> that the Bull might be showen to
some of the Kings Council. Upon that (Sir <hi>Gregory</hi> being then out of
<hi>Rome</hi>) the Proto-Notary went to the Pope, and complained that
<hi>Campegio</hi> had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the Divorce. The Pope justified him in it, and
said, He did as he had ordered him. He next complained that the Legate would
not proceed to execute the Legantine Commission. The Pope denied that 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104314:43"/> he had any order from him to delay his proceedings, but
that by vertue of his Commission they might go on and pass Sentence. Then the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to-Notary pressed him for leave to shew the Bull to some of the Kings
Council, complaining of <hi>Campegio's</hi> stiffness in refusing it, and that
he would not trust it to the Cardinal of <hi>York,</hi> who was his equal in
the Commission. To this the Pope answered in passion, That he could shew the
Cardinals Letter, in which he assures him, that the Bull should only be shewed
to the King and himself; and that if it were not granted he was ruined,
therefore to preserve him he had sent it, but had ordered it to be burnt when
it was once shewed. He wished he had never sent it, saying, he would gladly
lose a Finger to recover it again, and expressed great grief for granting it:
and said, They had got him to send it, and now would have it showed, to which
he would never consent, for then he was undone for ever. Upon this, the
Proto-Notary laid before him the danger of losing the King, and the Kingdom of
<hi>England</hi>; of ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cardinal of <hi>York,</hi> and of the undoing
of their Family, whose hopes depended on the Cardinal; and that by these means
Heresie would prevail in <hi>England,</hi> which if it once had great footing
there, would not be so easily rooted out: That all persons judged the Kings
Cause right; but though it were not so, some things that were not good, must be
born with to avoid greater evils. And at last he fell down at his feet, and in
most passionate expressions begged him to be more compliant to the Kings
desires, and at least not to deny that small favour of showing the Decretal to
some few Counsellors, upon the assurance of absolute secrecy: But the Pope
interrupted him, and with great signs of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual grief, told him,<note place="margin">But all in vain.</note> these sad effects could not be charged on
him, he had kept his word, and done what he had promised, but upon no
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration would he do any thing that might wound his Conscience, or
blemish his Integrity. Therefore let them proceed as they would in
<hi>England,</hi> he should be free of all blame, but should confirm their
Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And he protested he had given <hi>Campegio</hi> no commands to make
any delays, but only to give him notice of their proceedings. If the King, who
had maintained the Apostolick See, had written for the Faith, and was the
Defender of it, would over-turn it, it would end in his own disgrace. But at
last the secret came out, for the Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed there was a League in Treaty
between the Emperor and himself; but denied that he had bound himself up by it,
as to the Kings business.</p>
            <p>The Pope consulted with the Cardinals, <hi>Sanctorum Quatuor</hi>
and <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netta,</hi> (not mentioning the <hi>Decretal</hi> to them, which
he had granted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communicating it to any body, or entring it in any
Register) and they were of opinion that the Process should be carried on in
<hi>England,</hi> without demanding any thing further from <hi>Rome.</hi> But
the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cardinals spake against it, and were moving presently for an
Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an Avocation of the Cause, to be tried at the Court of
<hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope also took notice, that the Intercession of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> had not prevailed with the
<hi>Venetians</hi> to restore <hi>Cervia</hi> and <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which they
had taken from him; and that he could not think that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick durst do so, if
these Kings were in earnest. It had been promised that they should be restored
as soon as his Legate was sent to <hi>England,</hi> but it was not yet done.
The Proto-Notary told him it should most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be done. Thus ended that
Conversation. But the more earnest <pb n="58" facs="tcp:104314:44"/>

               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:104314:45"/> the Cardinal was to
have the Bull seen by some of the Privy-Council, the Pope was the more
confirmed in his resolutions never to consent to it. For he could not imagine
the desire of seeing it was a bare curiosity, or only to direct the Kings
Counsellors; since the King and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal could inform them of all the
material Clauses that were in it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he judged the desire of seeing it
was only that they might have so many witnesses to prove that it was once
granted, whereby they had the Pope in their power; and this he judged too
dangerous for him to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to.</p>

Campegio</hi> found still means by new delays to put off the business, and
amused the King with new and subtle motions for ending the matter more
dextrously. Upon which, in the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Brian</hi> and <hi>Peter Vannes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">New Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors sent
  to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               </note> the Kings Secretary for the Latine Tongue were sent to
<hi>Rome.</hi> They had it in Commission to search all the Records there, for
the <hi>Breve</hi> that was now so much talked of in <hi>Spain.</hi> They were
to propose several overtures. 
<q>Whether if the Queen vowed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Pope would not
  dispence with the Kings second Marriage? or if the Queen would not vow
  Religion,<note place="margin">With other overtures.</note> unless the King also
  did it, Whether in that case would the Pope dispence with his vow? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
  if the Queen would hear of no such proposition, would not the Pope dispence
  with the Kings having two Wives? For which there were diverss presidents
  vouched from the Old Testament.</q> They were to represent to the Pope that the
King had laid out much of his best Treasure in his Service, and therefore he
expected the highest favours out of the deepest Treasure of the Church. And
<hi>Peter Vannes</hi> was commanded to tell the Pope as of himself,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 19th.</note> that if he did for partial
respects and fears, refuse the Kings desires, he perceived it would not only
alienate the King from him, but that many other Princes his Confederates, with
their Realms, would withdraw their Devotion and Obedience from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
See.</p>
            <p>By a dispatch that followed them, the Cardinal tried a new
project, which was an offer of 2000 men for a Guard to the Pope,<note place="margin">A Guard of 2000 men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Pope.</note> to be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the cost of the King and his Confederates. And also proposed an enterview of
the Pope, the Emperor, the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of other
Princes, to be either at <hi>Nice, Avignon,</hi> or in <hi>Savoy,</hi> and that
himself would come thither from the King of <hi>England.</hi> But the Pope
resolved stedfastly to keep his ground, and not to engage himself too much to
any Prince; therefore the motion of a Guard did not at all work upon him. To
have Guards about him upon another Princes pay, was to be their Prisoner; and
he was so weary of his late Imprisonment, that he would not put himself in
hazard of it a second time. Besides, such a Guard would give the Emperor just
cause of jealousie, and yet not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him against his power. He had been also
so unsuccesful in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests with the Emperor,<note place="margin">The Pope
  resolved to unite himself to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> that he had no mind to give
him any new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation: And though the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France</hi> gave him good words, yet they did nothing, nor did the King
make War upon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, so that his Armies lying in <hi>Italy,</hi> he was
still under his power. Therefore the Pope resolved to unite himself firmly to
the Emperor; <pb n="61" facs="tcp:104314:45"/> and all the use he made of the Kings
earnestness in his Divorce, was only to bring the Emperor to better terms. The
<hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> were like to make great use of any
decision he might make against any of his Predecessors Bulls. The Cardinal
Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> had written to him to consider well what he did in
the Kings Divorce, for if it went on, nothing had ever fallen out since the
beginning of <hi>Luthers</hi> Sect, that would so much strenghen it as that
Sentence. He was also threatned on the other side from <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Being frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tned with the threats of the Imperialists.</note> that
the Emperor would have a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil called, and whatsoever he did in this
Process should be examined there, and he proceeded against accordingly. Nor did
they forget to put him in mind of his Birth, that he was a <hi>Bastard,</hi>
and so by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non incapable of that Dignity, and that thereupon they would
depose him. He having all these things in his prospect, and being naturally of
a fearful temper, which was at this time more prevalent in him by reason of his
late Captivity, resolved not to run these hazards, which seemed unavoidable, if
he proceeded further in the Kings business. But his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Maxime, being to
promise and swear deepest, when he intended least, he sent <hi>Campana</hi> to
<hi>England,</hi> with a Letter of Credence to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal the effects of
which message will appear afterwards. And thus ended this year, in which it was
believed that if the King had employed that Money, which was spent in a
fruitless Negotiation at <hi>Rome,</hi> on a War in <hi>Flanders,</hi> it had
so distracted the Emperors Forces, and encouraged the Pope, that he had sooner
granted that, which in a more fruitless way was sought of him.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the next year, <hi>Cassali</hi> wrote to the
Cardinal,<note place="margin">1529. <hi>Ian.</hi> 3.</note> that the Pope was
much inclined to unite himself with the Emperor, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to go in Person
to <hi>Spain,</hi> to solicite a general Peace; but intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go privately,
and desired the Cardinal would go with him thither, as his Friend and
Counsellor, and that they two should go as Legates. But <hi>Cassali,</hi> by
<hi>Salviati's</hi> means, who was in great favour with the Pope, understood
that the Pope was never in greater fear of the Emperor than at that time; for
his Ambassador had threatned the Pope severely, if he would not recal the
Commission that he had sent to <hi>England</hi>;<note place="margin">Repents his
  granting the Decretal.</note> so that the Pope spoke oft to <hi>Salviati</hi>
of the <hi>great Repentance that he had inwardly in his heart, for granting the
Decretal</hi>: and said, <hi>He was undone for ever, if it came to the Emperors
knowledge.</hi> He also resolved, that though the Legates gave Sentence in
<hi>England,</hi> it should never take effect, for he would not confirm it: Of
which <hi>Gregory Cassali</hi> gave Advertisement by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Messenger, who
as he passed through <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kings Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the
  Cardinal, <hi>Ian.</hi> 8th.</note> met Secretary <hi>Knight</hi> and Doctor
<hi>Bennet,</hi> whom the King had dispatched to <hi>Rome,</hi> to assist his
other Ambassadors there, and gave them an account of his message: and that it
was the Advice of the Kings Friends at <hi>Rome,</hi> That he and his
Confederates should follow the War more vigorously, and press the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
harder, without which all their applications to the Pope would signifie
nothing. Of this they gave the Cardinal an account, and went on but faintly in
their Journey, judging that upon these Advertisements they would be recalled,
and other Counsels taken.</p>
            <p>At the same time the Pope was with his usual Arts cajoling the
Kings Agents in <hi>Italy</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ian.</hi> 9.</note> For
when Sir <hi>Francis Brian</hi> and <hi>Peter Vannes</hi> came to
<hi>Bononia,</hi> the Proto-Notary <hi>Cassali</hi> was surprized, to hear that
the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was not already ended in <hi>England</hi>: since (he said) he
knew there were <pb n="62" facs="tcp:104314:46"/> sufficient Powers sent about it,<note place="margin">1529.</note> and that the Pope assured him he would confirm their
Sentence; but that he made a great difference between the confirming their
judgment, by which he had the Legates between him and the <hi>Envy</hi> or
<hi>Odium</hi> of it, and the granting a Bull, by which the Judgment should
arise immediately from himself. This his best Friends dissuaded, and he seemed
apprehensive, that in case he should do it, a Council would be called, and he
should be deposed for it. And any such distraction in the Papacy, considering
the footing which Heresie had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>read gotten, would ruin the Ecclesiastical
State, and the Church: So dextrously did the Pope govern himself between such
contrary tides. But all this Dissimulation was short of what he acted by
<hi>Campana</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> whose true errand thither was to order
<hi>Campegio</hi> to destroy the Bull; but he did so perswade the King and the
Cardinal of the Popes sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ian.</hi> 15.</note>
that by a dispatch to Sir <hi>Francis Brian,</hi> and <hi>Peter Vannes,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Gregory Cassali,</hi> he chid the two former for not making more
haste to <hi>Rome</hi>; for he believed it might have been a great advantage to
the Kings Affairs, if they had got thither before the <hi>General of the
Observants</hi> (then Cardinal <hi>Angell.</hi>) He ordered them to setle the
business of the Guard about the Pope presently, and tells them that the
Secretary was recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>Dr. Stephens</hi> again sent to <hi>Rome</hi>:
And in a Letter to Secretary <hi>Knight,</hi> who went no further than
<hi>Lions,</hi> he writ to him; 
<q>That <hi>Campana</hi> had assured the King and him,<note place="margin">But feeds the King with high promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> in the Popes name,
  that the Pope was ready to do, not only all that of Law, Equity, or Justice,
  could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired of him, but whatever of the <hi>fulness of his Power</hi> he
  could do or devise, for giving the King content: And that although there were
  three things, which the Pope had great reason to take care of; The calling a
  General Council, The Emperors descent into <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Restitution
  of his Towns, which were offered to be put in his hands by the Emperors means;
  yet neither these, nor any other considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, should divert him from doing
  all that lay within his Authority, or Power, for the King: And that he had so
  deep a sense of the Kings merits, and the obligations that he had laid on him,
  that if his resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Popedom might do him any Service, he would
  readily consent to it: And therefore in the Popes name he encouraged the
  Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to proceed and end the business.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon these assurances the Cardinal ordered the Secretary to haste
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to thank the Pope for that kind message, to
setle the Guard about him, and to tell him, that for a Council, none could be
called but by himself, with the consent of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France.</hi> And for any pretended Council or meeting of Bishops, which the
Emperor by the Cardinals of his Party might call, he needed not fear that. For
his Towns, they should be most certainly restored. Nor was the Emperors
offering to put them in his hand to be much regarded; for though he restored
them, if the Pope had not a better Guaranty for them, it would be easie for
him, to take them from him when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. He was also to propose a firmer
League between the Pope, <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> in order to
which, he was to move the Pope most earnestly to go to <hi>Nice</hi>; and if
the Pope proposed the Kings taking a second Wife, with a Legitimation of the
Issue, which she might have, so the Queen might be induced to enter into a
state of Religion, to which the Pope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined most, he was not to accept of
that; both because the thing would <pb n="63" facs="tcp:104314:46"/> take up much time, and
they found the Queen resolved to do nothing, but as she was advised by her
Nephews. Yet if the Pope offered a <hi>Decretal</hi> about it, he might take
it, to be made use of as the Occasion might require. But by a Postscript he is
recalled, and it is signified to him, that <hi>Gardiner</hi> was sent to Rome,
to negotiate these a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fairs, who had
returned to <hi>England</hi> with the Legate, and his being so suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful in
his former Message, made them think him the fittest Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster they could imploy
in that Court; and to send him with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Advantage, he was made a Privy
Councellour.</p>
            <p>But an unlooked-for Accident put a stop to all Proceedings in the
Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pope sickens.</note> For on
<hi>Epiphany</hi>-day the Pope was taken extreme ill at Mass, and a great
sickness followed, of which it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed he could not recover;
and though his distemper did soon abate so much, that it was thought to be
over, yet it returned again upon him, insomuch that the Physicians did suspect
he was poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned. Then followed all the secret Caballings and Intrigues, which
are ordinary in that Court upon such an occasion. The <hi>Collonna's</hi> and
the other Imperialists were very busie, but the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi>
opposed them; and <hi>Farnese</hi> who was then at his house in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
came to <hi>Rome</hi> and joyned with <hi>Mantua</hi>; and these of that
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, resolved that if the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army marched from
<hi>Naples</hi> toward them, they would dispence with that Bull, which provides
that the Succeeding Pope should be chosen in the same place where the former
died, and would retire to some safe place. Some of the Cardinals spoke highly
in favour of Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ian.</hi>
  27.</note> whom (if the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors did not flatter and lie grosly in their
Letters, from which I draw these Informations) they reverenced <hi>as a
Deity.</hi> And the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua,</hi> it seems, proposing him as a
Pattern, would needs have a Particular account of his whole Course of Life, and
expressed great esteem for him. When <hi>Gardiner</hi> was come as far as
<hi>Lions</hi> he wrote the Cardinal word, that there went a Prophecy that an
Angel should be the next Pope, but should die soon after. He also gave Advice
that if the Pope died, the Commission for the Legates must needs expire with
him, unless they made some Step in their Business, by a Citation of Parties,
which would keep it alive; but whether this was done or not I cannot find.<note place="margin">

               </note> The Cardinals Ambition was now
fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting strongly, and he resolved to lay his Project for the Popedom better
than he had done before. His Letter about it to <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and the
Kings Instructions to his Ambassadors, are Printed by <hi>Fox,</hi> and the
Originals from which they are taken are yet extant. He wrote also another
Letter to the Ambassadors, which the Reader will find in the Collection.<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.</note> But because the Instructions
show what were the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in choosing Popes in those days, by which it may be
easily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, how such an Election must needs recommend a man to
Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, Supremacy, and all the other Appendages of <hi>Christs Vicar on
Earth,</hi> I shall give a short Summary of them.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>By his Letter to his Confident <hi>Gardiner,</hi> he commits the
  thing chiefly to his care, and orders him to employ all his parts, to bring it
  to the desired issue; sparing neither Presents, nor Promises; and that as he
  saw mens Inclinations or affections led them, whether to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private
  Concerns, so he should govern himself towards them <pb n="64" facs="tcp:104314:47"/>
  accordingly. <hi>The Instructions bear,</hi> that the King thought the
  Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal the fittest person to succeed to the Papacy; (they being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
  that the Pope was dead;<note place="margin">The Kings Instructions for the
 Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note>) that the <hi>French</hi> King did also of his own Motion
  offer his Assistance to him in it, and that both for publick and private ends,
  the Cardinal was the fittest. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ambassadots are required with all
  possible earnestness and vigour, to promote his Election. A Schedule of the
  Cardinals names is sent them with marks to every one, whether he was like to be
  present or absent, favourable, indifferent, or opposite to them. It was
  reckoned there could be but 39 present,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi>
                  </note>
  of which 26 were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to choose the Pope. Of these the two Kings thought
  them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sure of 20. So 6 was all the number that the Ambassadors were to
  gain, and to that number, they were first to offer them good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to
  convince them of the Cardinals fitness for the Papacy. But because humane
  frailty was such, that reason did not always take place, they were to promise
  Promotions, and Sums of Money, with other good Rewards, which the King gave
  them Commission to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and would certainly make them good: besides all the
  great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments which the Cardinal had, that should be shared among those
  who did procure his Election. The Cardinals of their Party were first to enter
  into a firm bond, to exclude all others. They were also to have some Creatures
  of theirs to go into the Conclave, to manage the Business. Sir <hi>Gregory
  Cassali,</hi> was thought fittest for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And if they saw the
  adverse party too strong in the Conclave, so that they could carry nothing,
  then <hi>Gardiner</hi> was to draw a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, which should be made in
  name of the two Crowns; and that being made, all the Cardinals of their Faction
  were to leave the Conclave. And if the fear of the Emperors Forces overawed
  them, the Ambassadors were to offer a Guard of 2 or 3000. men to secure the
  Cardinals: and the <hi>French</hi> King Ordered his Armies to move, if the
  <hi>Spanish</hi> Troops did move either from <hi>Naples,</hi> or
  <hi>Millan.</hi> They were also to assure them, that the Cardinal would
  presently upon his Election come and live at <hi>Rome,</hi> and were to use all
  endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to gain the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> to their Faction; but at
  the same time to assure the <hi>Florentines,</hi> that <hi>Wolsey</hi> would
  assist them to exclude the <hi>Medici</hi> out of the Government of their Town
  and State. They were also to have a strict eye upon the motions of the
  <hi>French</hi> Faction, lest if the Cardinal were excluded, they should
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to any other, and refuse to make the Protestation as it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.
  But to oblige <hi>Campegio</hi> the more, it was added, that if they found all
  hopes of raising the Cardinal of <hi>York</hi> to vanish, then they should try
  if <hi>Campegio</hi> could be Elected; and in that case the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals of their
  Faction were to make no Protestation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These were the Apostolical Methods, then used for choosing a
Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour to St. <hi>Peter</hi>; for though a Successour had been chosen to
<hi>Iudas</hi> by lot, yet more Caution was to be used in choosing one for the
Prince of the Apostles. But when the Cardinal heard that the Pope was not dead,
and that there was hope of his recovery, he wrote another long Letter to the
Ambassadors (the Original of which is yet extant) 
<q> to keep all their Instructions about a new Pope very secret, to
  be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as many Cardinals as they could, and to take care that the
  Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals <pb n="65" facs="tcp:104314:47"/> should not go into the Conclave, unless they
  were free, and safe from any fears of the Imperial Forces. But if the Pope
  reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,<note place="margin">

                  </note> they were
  to press him to give such orders about the Kings Business, that it might be
  speedily ended: and then the Cardinal would come and wait on the Pope over to
  <hi>Spain,</hi> as he had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And for the Apprehensions the Pope had of
  the Emperors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly offended with him, if he granted the Kings desire,
  or of his coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> he needed not fear him. They knew
  what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Emperor pretended about his obligation to protect his Aunt, it
  was only for reason of State: but if he were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> satisfied in other things,
  that would be soon passed over. They knew also that his design of going into
  <hi>Italy</hi> was laid aside for that year; because he apprehended that
  <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> would make War on him in other places.
  There were also many Precedents found, of Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations granted by Popes in
  like cases: And lately there had been one granted by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>
  the 6th, to the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Opinion of his
  Cardinals, which had never been questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: and yet he could not pretend to
  such Merits as the King had.</q> And all that had ever been said in the Kings
Cause, was Sum'd up in a short Breviate by <hi>Cassali,</hi> and offered to the
Pope; a Copy whereof taken from an Original under his own hand,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.</note> the Reader will find in the
Collection.</p>
            <p>The King ordered his Ambassadors to make as many Cardinals sure
for his cause, as they could, who might bring the Pope to consent to it, if he
were still averse. But the Pope was at this time possessed with a new
jealousie, of which the <hi>French</hi> King was not free, as if the King had
been tampering with the Emperor, and had made him great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, so he would
consent to the Divorce; about which <hi>Francis</hi> wrote an anxious Letter to
<hi>Rome,</hi> the Original of which I have seen. The Pope was also surprized
at it, and questioned the Ambassadors about it; but they denyed it, and said
the union between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> was inseparable, and
that these were only the Practices of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Agents to create distrust.
The Pope seemed satisfied with what they said, 
<q>and added that in the present conjuncture a firm union between
  them was necessary.</q> Of all this Sir <hi>Francis Brian</hi> wrote a long
account in cipher.</p>
            <p>

  Death, to propose two things to him: the one, that he would presently command

  and other Popes had done; and if he should die, he could not do a thing that

  great Interest with the Pope, so by that, and another Dispatch of the same
  Date, (sent another way) they were ordered to gain him, promising him great
  Rewards, pressing him to remain still about the Popes person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ballance
  the ill Offices which Cardinal <hi>Angell,</hi> and the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of
  <hi>Capua</hi> did, who never stirred from the Pope: And to assure that Bishop,
  that the King laid this Matter more to heart, than any thing that ever befel
  him; and that it would trouble him as much to be overcome in this Matter by
  these two Friers, as to loose both his Crowns: and for my part (<hi>writes the
  Cardinal</hi>) I would expose any thing to my life, yea life it self, rather
  than see the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies that may ensue upon disappointing of the Kings
  desire.</q> For promoting the Business, the <hi>French</hi> King sent the
Bishop of <hi>Bayon,</hi> to assist the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadors in his
name, who was first sent over to <hi>England,</hi> to be well Instructed there.

<q>They were either to procure a Decretal for the Kings Divorce, or
  a new Commission to the two Legates, with ampler Clauses in it, than the former
  had; to judge as if the Pope were in person, and to emit compulsorie Letters
  against any, whether Emperor, King, or of what degree soever, to produce all
  manner of Evidences or Records, which might tend towards the clearing the
  Matter, and to bring them before them.</q> This was sought because the Emperor
would not send over the pretended Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <hi>Breve,</hi> to
<hi>England,</hi> and gave only an Attested Copy of it to the Kings
Ambassadors: least therefore from that <hi>Breve,</hi> a new Suit might be
afterwards raised, for Annulling any Sentence which the Legates should give,
they thought it needful to have the Original brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. In the
penning of that new Commission, Dr. <hi>Gardiner</hi> was ordered to have
special care that it should be done, by the best advice he could get in
<hi>Rome.</hi> It appears also from this Dispatch, that the Popes
<hi>Pollicitation</hi> to Confirm the Sentence which the Legates should give,
was then in <hi>Gardiner's</hi> hands, for he was ordered to take care that
there might be no disagreement between the date of it, and of the new
Commission. And when that was obtained, Sr. <hi>Francis Brian</hi> was
commanded to bring them with him to <hi>England.</hi> Or if neither a Decretal,
nor a new Commission could be obtained, then if any other expedient were
proposed, that upon good advice should be found sufficient and effectual, they
were to accept of it, and send it away with all possible diligence. 
<q>And the Cardinal conjured them by the Reverence of Almighty God,
  to bring them out of their Perplexity, that this Virtuous Prince may have this
  thing sped, which would be the most joyous thing that could befal his heart
  upon Earth. But if all things should be denyed, then they were to make their
  Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, not only to the Pope, but to the Cardinals, of the Injustice
  that was done the King, and in the Cardinals name to let them know that not
  only the King and his Realm would be lost, but also the <hi>French</hi> King
  and his Realm, with their other Confederates, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so withdraw their
  Obedience from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was more to be regarded, than
  either the Emperors Displeasure, or the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of two Cities.</q> They were
also to try what might be done in Law by the Cardinals in a Vacancy, and they
were to take good Counsel upon some Chapters of the Canon-Law, which related to
that: and <pb n="67" facs="tcp:104314:49"/> Govern themselves accordingly, either to hinder
an Avocation,<note place="margin">1529.</note> or Inhibition, or if it could be
done to obtain such thing, as they could grant, towards the Conclusion of the
Kings Business. At this time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Cardinals Bulls for the Bishoprick of
<hi>Winchester</hi> were expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Bulls for
  the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</hi>
               </note> they were rated high at 15000
Ducats, for though the Cardinal pleaded his great Merits, to bring the
composition lower, yet the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals at <hi>Rome,</hi> said the Apostolick
Chamber was very poor, and other Bulls were then coming from <hi>France,</hi>
to which the favour they should show the Cardinal would be a Precedent. But the
Cardinal sent word that he would not give past 5, or 6000 Ducats, because he
was exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Winchester</hi> for <hi>Duresm,</hi> and by the other they
were to get a great Composition. And if they held his Bulls so high, he would
not have them; for he needed them not, since he enjoyed already by the Kings
Grant the Temporalities of <hi>Winchester</hi>; which it is very likely was all
that he considered in a Bishoprick. They were at last expedited, at what Rates
I cannot tell; but this I set down to show, how severe the Exactions of the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> were.</p>
            <p>As the Pope recovered his health,<note place="margin">The Pope
  inclines to joyn with the Emperor.</note> so he inclined more to joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Emperor than ever, and was more alienated than formerly from the King
and the Cardinal; which perhaps was increased by the distaste he took at the
Cardinals aspiring to the Popedom. The first thing that the Emperor did in the
Kings Cause, was to protest in the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> name, that she
refused to submit to the Legates. The one was the Kings chief Minister and her
mortal enemy:<note place="margin"> 
                  <p>Who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests against the Legates Commission.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 15.</p>
               </note> The other was also justly
suspected, since he had a Bishoprick in <hi>England.</hi> The Kings Ambassador
pressed the Pope much, not to admit the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation; but it was pretended
that it could not be denyed, either in Law or Justice. But that this might not
offend the King, <hi>Salviati</hi> that was the Popes Favourite, wrote to
<hi>Campegio,</hi> that the Protestation could not be hindred, but that the
Pope did still most earnestly desire to satisfie the King, and that the
Ambassadors were much mistaken, who were so distrustful of the Popes good mind
to the Kings Cause. But now good words could deceive the King no longer, who
clearly discovered the Popes mind, and being out of all hopes of any thing more
from <hi>Rome,</hi> resolved to proceed in <hi>England</hi> before the Legates:
and therefore <hi>Gardiner</hi> was recalled, who was thought the fittest
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to manage the Process in <hi>England,</hi> being esteemed the greatest
Canonist they had; and was so valued by the King, that he would not begin the
Process till he came.<note place="margin">Collect <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.</note> Sr.
<hi>Francis Brian</hi> was also recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and when they took leave of the
Pope, they were ordered to Expostulate in the Kings name: 
<q>Upon the Partiality he expressed for the Emperor,
  notwithstanding the many assurances, that both the Legates had given the King,
  that the Pope would do all he could to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Satisfaction; which was now so
  ill performed that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no more justice from him. They were also to
  say, as much as they could devise in the Cardinals name, to the same purpose,
  up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they were to try, if it were possible to obtain any Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
  the Commission with fuller Power to the Legates; for they saw it was in vain to
  move for any new Bulls,<note place="margin">The Pope promised not to recal, but
 to confirm it.</note> or Orders from the Pope about it.</q> And though
<hi>Gardiner</hi> had obtained a Pollicitation from the Pope, by which he both
bound himself not to recal the cause from the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104314:50"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

their Sentence, and had sent it over; they found it was so conceived, that the
Pope could go back from it when he pleased. So there was a new Draught of a
Pollicitation formed with more binding Clauses in it, which <hi>Gardiner</hi>
was to try if he could obtain by the following Pretence. 
<q>He was to tell the Pope, that the Courier to whom he trusted it,
  had been so little careful of it, that it was all wet and defaced, and of no
  more use; so that he durst not deliver it. And this might turn much to
  <hi>Gardiners</hi> prejudice, that a matter of such Concern was through his
  neglect spoiled: upon which he was to see if the Pope would renew it. If that
  could be obtained, he was to use all his Industry to get as many pregnant and
  material words added, as might make it more binding. He was also to assure the
  Pope, that though the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was gone to <hi>Barcellona,</hi> to give
  reputation to his affairs in <hi>Italy</hi>; yet he had neither Army, nor Fleet
  ready, so that they needed not fear him. And he was to inform the Pope of the
  Arts he was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing both in the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Court to
  make a separated Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But that all was to no p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rpose, the two Kings being so firmly linked
  together.</q> But the Pope was so great a Master in all the Arts of
Dissimulation, and Policy, that he was not to be overreached easily; and when
he understood that his Polli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itation was defaced, he was in his heart glad at it, and could not
be prevailed with, to renew it. So they returned to <hi>England,</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Bennet</hi> came in their place. He carryed with him one of the fullest and
most important Dispatches that I find in this whole matter,<note place="margin">The Legates write to the Pope.</note> from the two Legates to the
Pope, and the Consistory, who wrote to them, 
<q>that they had in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perswade either party to
  yield to the other;<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.</note> That
  the <hi>Breve</hi> being shewed to them by the Queen, they found great and
  e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Presumptions of it's being a meer forgery; and that they thought it
  was too much for them to sit and try the Validity, or Authenticalness of the
  Popes Bulls, or Breves, or to hear his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Dispencing in such cases
  disputed: therefore it was more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to Avocate the cause, to which the
  King would consent, if the Pope obliged himself under his hand, to pass
  Sentence speedily in his favour; but they rather advised the Granting a
  Decretal Bull which would put an end to the whole matter, in order to which the
  Bearer was Instructed to show very good Precedents. But in the mean while, they
  advised the Pope to press the Queen most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, to enter into a
  Religious life, as that which would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all these differences in the
  softest and easiest way. It pitied them to see the rack and torments of
  Conscience, under which the King had smarted so many years: and that the
  Disputes of Divines, and the Decrees of Fathers, had so disquieted him, that
  for clearing a matter thus perplexed, there was not only need of Learning, but
  of a more singular Piety and Illumination. To this were to be added the desire
  of Issue, the Settlement of the Kingdom, with many other pressing reasons: that
  as the matter did admit of no further delays, so there was not any thing in the
  opposite scale to ballance these Considerations. There were false Suggestions
  surmised abroad, as if the hatred of the Queen, or the desire of another wife
  (who was not perhaps yet known, much less designed) were the true causes of 
  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:104314:51"/> this Suit. But though the Queen was of a rough Temper, and
  an unpleasant Conversation, and was passed all hopes of Children; yet who could
  imagine that the King who had spent his most youthful days with her, so kindly,
  would now in the decline of his Age, be at all this trouble to be rid of her,
  if he had no other Motives? But they by searching his sore, found there was
  rooted in his heart, both an awe of God, and a respect to Law and Order; so
  that though all his people pressed him to drive the Matter to an issue, yet he
  would still wait for the decision of the Apostolick See. Therefore they most
  pressingly desire the Pope to grant the Cure which his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper required, and
  to consider that it was not fit to insist too much on the Rigour of the Law;
  but since the Soul and Life of all the Laws of the Church was in the Popes
  breast; in doubtful cases, where there was great hazard, he ought to mollifie
  the severity of the Laws, which if it were not done, other Remedies would be
  found out, to the vast prejudice of the Ecclesiastical Authority, to which many
  about the King advised him: There was reason to fear they should not only lose
  a King of <hi>England,</hi> but a <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> The Nobility
  and Gentry were already enraged at the delay of a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which all their
  Lives and Interests were so nearly concerned: and said many things against the
  Popes Proceedings, which they could not relate without horror. And they plainly
  complained, that whereas Popes had made no scruple to make and change divine
  Laws, at their pleasure; yet one Pope sticks so much at the Repealing what his
  Prodecessor did, as if that were more sacred, and not to be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with. The
  King betook himself to no ill Arts, neither to the charms of Magitians, nor the
  Forgeries of Impostours, therefore they expected such an Answer as should put
  an end to the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But all these things were to no purpose:<note place="margin">

               </note> the Pope had taken his measures,
ard was not to be moved by all the reasons, or Remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Ambassador
could lay before him. The King had absolutely gained <hi>Campegio</hi> to do
all he could for him without losing the Popes favour. He led at this time a
very dissolute life in <hi>England,</hi> hunting and gaming all the day long,
and following whores all the night: and brought a Bastard of his own over to
<hi>England</hi> with him, whom the King Knighted, so that if the King sought
his pleasure, it was no strange thing: since he had such a Copy set him by two
Legates, who representing his Holiness so lively in their manners, it was no
unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual thing, if a King had a slight sense of such disorders. The King wrote
to his Ambassadors,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>April</hi> 6.</note> that he was
satisfied of <hi>Campegio's</hi> love and affection to him, and if ever he was
gained by the Emperors Agents, he had said something to him which did totally
change that Inclination.</p>
            <p>The Imperialists being Alarm'd at the recalling of some of the
<hi>English</hi> Ambassadors, and being Informed by the Queens means,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror presses for an Avocation.</note> that they were
forming the Process in <hi>England,</hi> put in a Memorial for an Avocation of
the cause to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Ambassadors answered, that there was no Colour
for asking it, since there was nothing yet done by the Legates. For they had
strict orders to deny that there was any Process forming in <hi>England,</hi>
even to the Pope himself in private, unless he had a mind it should go on; but
were to use all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours <pb n="70" facs="tcp:104314:52"/> to hinder an Avocation;
and plainly in the Kings name, to tell the Pope, that if he granted that, the
King would look on it as a Formal decision against him. And it would also be an
high affront to the two Cardinals: and they were thereupon to Protest, that the
King would not obey,<note place="margin">Which the Kings Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors oppose
  much.</note> nor consider the Pope any more, if he did an Act of such high
Injustice; as after he had granted a Commission, upon no complaint of any
Illegality, or Injust Proceedings of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, but only upon surmises and
suspitions, to take it out of their hands. But the Pope had not yet brought the
Emperor to his Terms in other things, therefore to draw him on the faster, he
continued to give the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador good words; and in discourse
with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Vannes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Popes deep
  dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> did insinuate as if he had found a means to bring the

adding, <hi>In the name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. But would not speak it
out,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25th.</note> and seemed to keep
it up as a secret, not yet ripe. But all this did afterwards appear to be the
deepest Dissimulation that ever was practised. And in the whole Process, though
the Cardinal studied to make tricks pass upon him, yet he was always too hard
for them all at it; and seemed as Infallible in his Arts of Jugling, as he

               <note place="margin">The Pope complains of the
  <hi>Florentines</hi>
               </note>Soon after this, the Pope complained much to Sr.

Ambassador, and that their Confederates, the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the Duke

                  <hi>Iune</hi> 5.</note>
that they would force him to throw himself into the Emperors hands: and he
seemed inclined to grant an Avocation of the cause, and complained that there
was a Treaty of peace going on at <hi>Cambray,</hi> in which he had no share.
But the Ambassador undertook that nothing should be done to give him just
offence; yet the <hi>Florentines</hi> continued to put great affronts on him,
and his Family: and the Abbot of <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa</hi> their General, made excursions
to the gates of <hi>Rome</hi>; 
<q> so that the Pope with great signs of fear said that the

                     <hi>Iune</hi> 13.</note> and carry him with his hands bound behind
  his back in Procession to <hi>Florence</hi>: and that all this while the Kings
  of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> did only entertain him with good words,
  and did not so much as restrain the Insolencies of their Confederates. And
  whereas they used to say, that if he joyned himself to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, he would
  treat him as his Chaplain, he said with great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, that he would not
  only choose rather to be his Chaplain, but his horse-Groom, than suffer such
  injuries from his own Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Vassals and Subjects.</q> This was perhaps
set on by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Arts, to let the Pope feel the weight of offending the
King, and to oblige him to use him better: but it wrought a contrary effect,
for the Treaty between the Emperor and him, was the more advanced by it. And
the Pope reckoned that the Emperor being (as he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ashamed and
grieved for the taking and Sacking of <hi>Rome,</hi> would study to repair that
by better usage for the future.</p>

               </note>The Motion for the
Avocation was still driven on, and pressed the more earnestly, because they
heard the Legates were proceeding in the cause. But the Ambassadors were
instructed by a Dispatch from the King, to obviate that carefully; for as it
would reflect on the Legates, <pb n="71" facs="tcp:104314:52"/> and defeat the Commission,
and be a gross violation of the Popes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which they had in writing; so
it was more for the Popes Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, to leave it in the Legates hands, than to
bring it before himself; for then, whatever Sentence passed, the ill effects of
it would ly on the Pope without any Interposition. And as the King had very
just exceptions to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Emperors forces lay so near, that
no safety could be expected there; so they were to tell the Pope that by the
Laws of <hi>England, the Prerogative of the Crown Royal was such,</hi> that the
Pope could do nothing that was prejudicial to it: To which the citing the King
to <hi>Rome,</hi> to have his cause decided there, was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a high
degree. And if the Pope went on, notwithstanding all the diligence they could
use to the contrary, they were by an other Dispatch which <hi>Gardiner</hi>
sent, ordered to <hi>Protest</hi> and <hi>Appeal</hi> from the Pope as <hi>not
the true Vicar of Christ, to a true Vicar.</hi> But the King upon second
thoughts, judged it not fit to proceed to this Extremity so soon. They were
also ordered to advertise the Pope, that all the Nobility had assured the King,
they would adhere to him, in case he were so ill used by the Pope, that he were
constrained to withdraw his obedience from the Apostolick See; and that the
Cardinals ruine was unavoidable, if the Pope granted the Avocation. The
Emperors Agents had pretended they could not send the original <hi>Breve</hi>
into <hi>England,</hi> and said their Master would send it to <hi>Rome,</hi>
upon which the Ambassadors had soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited for Letters Compulsory, to require
him to send it to <hi>England</hi>; yet left that might now be made an Argument
by the <hi>Imperialists</hi> for an Avocation, they were ordered to speak no
more of it, for the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates would proceed to Sentence, upon the attested Copy
that was sent from <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ambassadors had also orders to take the best Counsel in
<hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iune</hi> 28.</note> about the Legal ways
of hindring an Avocation. But they found it was not fit to rely much on the
Lawyers in that matter. For as on the one hand, there was no secrecy to be
expected from any of them, they having such expectations of preferments from
the Pope, (which were beyond all the Fees that could be given them,) that they
disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all secrets to him: So none of them would be earnest to hinder an
Avocation, it being their Interest to bring all Matters to <hi>Rome,</hi> by
which they might hope for much greater Fees. And <hi>Salviati</hi> whom the
Ambassadors had gained, told them, that <hi>Campana</hi> brought word out of
<hi>England,</hi> that the Process was then in a good forwardness. They with
many Oaths denyed there was any such thing, and <hi>Silvester Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> who
was sent express to <hi>Rome,</hi> for opposing the Avocation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed all
that they swore. But nothing was believed, for by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conveyance,
<hi>Campana</hi> had Letters to the contrary. And when they objected to
<hi>Salviati,</hi> what was promised by <hi>Campana,</hi> in the Popes name,
that he would do every thing for the King, <hi>that he could do out of the
fulness of his Power</hi>; 
<q>He answered, that <hi>Campana</hi> swore he had never said any
  such thing. So hard is the case of Ministers in such ticklish negotiations,
  that they must say, and unsay, swear, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear, as they are Instructed,
  which goes of Course, as a part of their Business.</q>

                  <hi>Orig. Iourn Cott. Libr. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</hi> B. 12.</note> upon which
they Sate that same day. The Commission was presented by <hi>Longland,</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> which was given to the Proto-Notary of the Court,
and he read it publickly; then the Legates took it in their hands, and said,
They were resolved to Execute it: And first gave the usual Oaths to the Clerks
of the Court, and ordered a peremto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Citation of the King and Queen to appear
on the 18th of <hi>Iune,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 9 and 10 a Clock; and so the Court
Adjourned. The next Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was on the 18th of <hi>Iune,</hi> where the
Citations being returned duely Executed; <hi>Richard Simpson,</hi> Dean of the
Chappel, and Mr. <hi>Iohn Bell,</hi> appeared as the Kings Proxies. But the
Queen appeared in Person, and did protest against the Legates as incompetent
Judges, alledging that the cause was already Avocated by the Pope, and desired
a competent time in which she might prove it. The Legates assigned her the
21th, and so Adjourned the Court till then.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A severe charge against the Queen.</note>About
this time there was a severe Complaint exhibited against the Queen in Council,
of which there is an account given in a paper, that has somewhat written at the
conclusion of it, with the Cardinals own hand. 
<q>The substance of it is, That they were informed some designed to
  kill the King, or the Cardinal; in which, if she had any hand, she must not
  expect to be spared. That she had not shewed such love to the King, neither in
  Bed, nor out of Bed, as she ought. And now that the King was very pensive, and
  in much grief, she showed great signs of joy, setting on all people to
  Dancings, and other Diversions. This it seemed she did out of spite to the
  King, since it was contrary to her temper and ordinary behaviour. And whereas
  she ought rather to pray to God to bring this matter to a good conclusion, she
  seemed not at all serious; and that she might corrupt the peoples affections to
  the King, she showed her self much abroad, and by civilities, and gracious
  bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her head, which had not been her custom formerly, did study to work
  upon the people: And that having the pretended <hi>Breve</hi> in her hands, she
  would not show it sooner. From all which the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that she hated
  him, Therefore his Council did not think it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visable for him to be any more
  conversant with her, either in Bed or at Board. They also in their Consciences
  thought his life was in such danger, that he ought to withdraw himself from her
  company, and not suffer the Princess to be with her. These things were to be
  told her, to induce her to enter into a Religious Order, and to perswade her to
  submit to the King.</q> To which paper, the Cardinal added in Latine, <hi>That
she played the fool,</hi>

<hi>Iune,</hi> the Court Sate, The King and Queen were present in Person.
<hi>Campegio</hi> made a long Speech of the errand they were come about: 
<note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> 
               <q>That it was a new, unheard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of, vile, and intolerable
  thing, for the King and Queen to live in Adultery, or rather Incest; which they
  must now try, and proceed as they saw just cause.</q> And both the Legates made
deep protestations of the sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their minds, and that they would
proceed justly and fairly without any favour or partiality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:104314:53"/>As for the formal Speeches which the King and
Queen made, <hi>Hall,</hi> who never failed in trifles, sets them down, which I
incline to believe they really spoke; for with the Journals of the Court, I
find those Speeches written down, though not as a part of the Journal.</p>
            <p>But here the Lord <hi>Herbert's</hi> usual diligence fails him;
for he fancies the Queen never appeared after the 18th. upon which, because the
Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the next Sessions are lost, he infers against all the Histories of
that time, That the King and the Queen were not in Court together. And he seems
to conclude that the 25th of <hi>Iune,</hi> was the next Session after the
18th, but in that he was mistaken: For by an original Letter of the Kings to
his Ambassadors,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.</note> it is
plain that both the King and Queen came in Person into the Court; where they
both sate, with their Council stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about them: The Bishops of
<hi>Rochester,</hi> and St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> being
the Queens Council. When the King and Queen were called on, the King answered,
<hi>Here</hi>; but the Queen left her seat and went and kneeled down before
him, and made a Speech, that had all the Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in it to raise pity and
compassion in the Court. She said, 
<q>She was a poor woman, and a stranger in his Dominions, where she
  could neither expect good Council, nor indifferent Judges;<note place="margin">The Queen's Speech.</note> she had been long his Wife, and desired
  to know wherein she had offended him: she had been his Wife twenty years and
  more, and had born him seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Children, and had ever studied to please him;
  and protested he had found her a true Maid, about which she appealed to his own
  Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. If she had done any thing amiss, she was willing to be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
  with shame. Their Parents were esteemed very wise Princes, and no doubt had
  good Counsellors, and Learned men about them, when the Match was agreed:
  Therefore she would not submit to the Court, nor durst her Lawyers, who were
  his Subjects, and assigned by him, speak freely for her. So she desired to be
  excused till she heard from <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </q> That said, she rose up, and
made the King a low Reverence, and went out of the Court. And though they
called after her, she made no answer, but went away and would never again
appear in Court.</p>
            <p>She being gone, the King did publickly Declare,<note place="margin">The King gives the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Scruples.</note> what a true
and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Wife she had always been, and commended her much for her
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Qualities. Then the Cardinal of <hi>York</hi> desired the King would
witness, whether he had been the first or chief mover of that matter to him,
since he was suspected to have done it. In which the King did vindicate him,
and said, That he had always rather opposed it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested it arose meerly
out of a scruple in his Conscience, which was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by the Discourse of
the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador; who during the Treaty of a Match between his
Daughter, and the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> did except to her being
Legitimate, as begotten in an unlawful Marriage: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he resolved to try
the lawfulness of it, both for the quiet of his Conscience, and for clearing
the Succession of the Crown: And if it were found lawful, he was very well
satisfied to live still with the Queen. But upon that, he had first moved it in
Confession to the Bishop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>; then he had desired the
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to gather the Opinions of the Bishops, who
did all under their Hands and Seals De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare against the Marriage. This the
Arch-Bishop confirmed, but the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> denied his Hand was
at it. And the Arch-Bishop pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <pb n="74" facs="tcp:104314:54"/> he had his consent
to make another write his name to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the rest, which he
positively denied.</p>
            <p>The Court Adjourned to the 25th, ordering Letters Monitory to be
Issued out for Citing the Queen to appear under pain of Contumacy. But on the
25th,<note place="margin">The Queens Appeal.</note> was brought in her Appeal to
the Pope, the Original of which is extant, every page being both Subscribed,
and Superscribed by her. She excepted both to the Place, to the Judges, and to
her Council, in whom she could not confide; and therefore appealed and desired
her Cause might be heard by the Pope, with many things out of the Canon-Law, on
which she grounded it. This being read, and she not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was Declared
<hi>Contumax.</hi> Then the Legates being to proceed, <hi>ex of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio,</hi>
drew up Twelve Articles, upon which they were to examine wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.<note place="margin">Articles

                  </gap>.</note> The
substance of them was, 
<q>That Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> and the King were Brothers; that
  Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> did Marry the Queen, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated the Marriage; that
  upon his death the King by vertue of a Dispensation had Married her; that this

  that upon the complaints which the Pope had received, he had sent them now to

<hi>Arthur's</hi> having Consummated the Marriage, and that led them to say

did also give the Pope an account of their Progress, and by all means advised
an Avocation; for by this he thought to excuse himself to the King, to oblige
the Emperor much, and to have the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a man of Conscience.</p>
            <p>The Emperor, and his Brother <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> sent their
Ambassadors at <hi>Rome</hi> orders, to give the Pope no rest till it were
procured; and the Emperor said, He would look on a Sentence against his Aunt,
as a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to his Family, and would lose all his Kingdoms sooner than
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it. And they plied the Pope so warmly, that between them and the
<hi>English</hi> Ambassadors, he had for some days very little rest. To the one
he was kind, and to the other he resolved to be civil. The <hi>English</hi>
Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors met oft with <hi>Salviati,</hi> and studied to perswade him, that
the Process went not on in <hi>England</hi>; but he told them their
Intelligence was so good, that whatever they said on that head would not be
believed. <pb n="75" facs="tcp:104314:54"/> They next suggested, that it was visible
<hi>Campegio's</hi> advising an Avocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was only done to preserve himself
from the envy of the Sentence, and to throw it wholly on the Pope: for were the
matter once called to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope must give Sentence one way or
another, and so bear the whole burden of it. There were also secret surmises of
Deposing the Pope, if he went so far; for seeing that the Emperor prevailed so
much by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of that, the Cardinal resolved to try what operation such
threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in the Kings name might have. But they had no Armies near the
Pope, so that big words did only provoke and alienate him the more.</p>
            <p>The matter was such, that by the Canon-Law it could not be denied.
For to grant an Avocation of a Cause upon good reason, from the Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to
the Supreme Court, was a thing which by the course of Law was very usual: And
it was no less apparent that the Reasons of the Queens appeal were just and
good.<note place="margin">The Pope agrees with the Emperor.</note> But the secret
and most convincing Motives that wrought more on the Pope than all other
things, were, that the Treaty between him and the Emperor was now concerted:
There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this being to be published very speedily, the Pope thought it
necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to avocate the matter to <hi>Rome,</hi> before the publication of
the Peace, lest if he did it after, it should be thought that it had been one
of the secret Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Treaty, which would have cast a foul blot upon
him. Yet on the other hand he was not a little perplexed with the fears he had
of losing the King of <hi>England</hi>; he knew he was a man of an high Spirit,
and would resent what he did severely. 
<q>And the Cardinal now again order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Bennet</hi> in his
  name, and as with tears in his eyes,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi>
 29th.</note> lying at the Popes feet, to assure him, that the King and Kingdom
  of <hi>England</hi> were certainly lost, if the Cause were Avocated: Therefore
  he besought him to leave it still in their hands, and assured him, that for
  himself, he should rather be torn in pieces joynt by joynt, than do any thing
  in that matter contrary to his Conscience or to Justice.<note place="margin">Yet
 is in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities.</note>
               </q> These things had been oft said, and the
Pope did apprehend that ill effects would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; for if the King fell from
his Obedience to the Apostolick See, no doubt all the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Princes, who were already bandying against the Emperor, would joyn themselves
with him; and the Interests of <hi>France</hi> would most certainly engage that
King also into the Union, which would distract the Church, give encouragement
to Heresie, and end in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruin of the Popedom. But in all this the
crafty Pope comforted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that many times threatnings are not intended to
be made good, but are used to terrifie; and that the King who had written for
the Faith against <hi>Luther,</hi> and had been so ill used by him, would never
do a thing that would sound so ill, as because he could not obtain what he had
a mind to, therefore to turn Heretick: he also resolved to caress the
<hi>French</hi> King much, and was in hopes of making Peace between the Emperor
and him.</p>
            <p>But that which went nearest the Popes heart of all other things,
was the setting up of his Family at <hi>Florence</hi>: and the Emperor having
given him assurance of that, it weighed down all other considerations.
There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he resolved he would please the Emperor, but do all he could not to
lose the King: So on the 9th of <hi>Iuly</hi> he sent for the Kings
Ambassadors, and told them, the Process was now so far set on in
<hi>England,</hi> and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation so earnestly pressed, that he could deny
it no longer; for all the Lawyers in <hi>Rome</hi> had told him, the thing
could not be denied in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <pb n="76" facs="tcp:104314:55"/> course of Justice. Upon
this the Ambassadors told him what they had in Commission to say against it,
both from the King and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and pressed it with great vehemence: So
that the Pope by many sighs and tears showed how deep an impression that which
they said made upon him; he wished himself dead, that he might be delivered out
of that Martyrdom: and added these words, which because of their savouring so
much of an Apostolical Spirit, I set down: <hi>Wo is me, no body apprehends all
those evils better than I do. But I am so between the Hammer and the Forge,
that when I would comply with the Kings desires, the whole storm then must fall
on my head; and which is worse, on the Church of Christ.</hi> They did object
the many promises he had made them, both by word of mouth, and under his hand.
He answered, <hi>He desired to do more for the King than he had promised; but
it was impossible to refuse what the Emperor now demanded, whose Forces did so
surround him, that he could not only force him to grant him Iustice, but could
dispose of him and all his Concerns at his pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ambassadors seeing the Pope was resolved to grant the
Avocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pressed against it no further, but studied to put it off for some
time. And therefore proposed that the Pope would himself write about it to the
King, and not grant it till he received his answer. Of all this they gave
Advertisement to the King, and wrote to him, that he must either drive the
matter to a Sentence in great haste, or to prevent the affront of an

all the Packets that went or came by the way of <hi>Flanders</hi>; and to keep
up all <hi>Campegio's</hi> Letters, and to take care that no Bull might come to
<hi>England</hi>; for they did much apprehend that the Avocation would be
granted within very few days.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iuly</hi> 26.</note> Their
next Dispatch bore, that the Pope had sent for them to let them know, that he
had Signed the Avocation the day before.<note place="margin">The Avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is

Emperor and him was finished, and the Peace was to be proclaimed on the 18th of
<hi>Iuly</hi>; and that the Pope did not only fear the Emperor more than all
other Princes, but that he also trusted him more now. On the 19th of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> the Pope sent a Messenger with the Avocation to
<hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 30th.</note> with a
Letter to the Cardinal. To the King he wrote afterwards.</p>
            <p>All this while <hi>Campegio,</hi> as he had Orders from the Pope
to draw out the matter by delays,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the
  Legates.</note> so did it very dextrously: And in this he pretended a fair
excuse, that it would not be for the Kings honour to precipitate the matter too
much, lest great advantages might be taken from that by the Queens Party. That
therefore it was fit to proceed slowly, that the world might see with what
Moderation as well as Justice, the matter was handled. From the 25th of
<hi>Iune,</hi> the Court Adjourned to the 28th, ordering a second Citation, for
the Queen under the pains of Contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and of their proceeding to examine
Witnesses. And on the 28th they declared the Queen Contumacious the second
time; and examined several Witnesses upon the Articles, and Adjourned to the
5th of <hi>Iuly.</hi> on that day the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Breve</hi> were
read in Court, and the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil argued long against the validity of the
one, and the truth of the other, Upon the grounds that have been already
mentioned, in which <hi>Campegio</hi> was much disgusted to hear them argue
against the Popes Power, of granting such a Dispensation in a matter that was
against a Divine <pb n="77" facs="tcp:104314:55"/> Precept, alledging that his Power did not
exend so far. This the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates over-ruled, and said, that that was too high a
point for them to judg in, or so much as to hear argued; and that the Pope
himself was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper judge in that: 
<q>And it was odds but he would judge favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably for himself.</q>
The Court Adjourned to the 12th, and from that to the 14th. On these days the
Depositions of the rest of the Witnesses were taken, and some that were ancient
Persons were examined by a Commission from the Legates; and all the Depositions
were published on the 17th; other instruments relating to the Process, were
also read and verified in Court. On the 21th the Court sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to conclude the matter as was expected, and the
Instrument that the King had Signed when he came of Age, protesting that he
would not stand to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract made when he was under Age, was then read and
verified. Upon which, the Kings Council (of whom <hi>Gardiner</hi> was the
chief,) closed their Evidence, and summed up all that had been brought: and in
the Kings name, desired Sentence might be given.<note place="margin">All things

                  </gap> a Sentence.</note>
But <hi>Campegio</hi> pretending that it was fit some interval should be
between that and the Sentence, put it off till the 23th, being <hi>Friday</hi>;
and in the whole Process he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided, both being the ancienter Cardinal, and
chiefly to show great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; since exceptions might have been taken, if the
other had appeared much in it; so that he only sate by him for form: But all
the Orders of the Court were still directed by <hi>Campegio.</hi> On
<hi>Friday</hi> there was a great appearance, and a general expectation; but by
a strange surprize <hi>Campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi> Adjourned the Court to the 1st. of
<hi>October,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Campegio</hi> Adjourned the
  Court.</note> for which he pretended that they sate there as a part of the
Consistory of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore must follow the Rules of that Court,
which from that time till <hi>October</hi> was in a Vacation, and heard no
Causes: And this he averred to be true on the word of a true Prelate.</p>
            <p>The King was in a Chamber very near where he heard what passed,
and was inexpressibly surprized at it. The Dukes of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and
<hi>Suffolk</hi> were in Court, and complained much of this delay; and pressed
the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to give Sentence. <hi>Campegio</hi> answered, that, what they
might then pronounce would be of no force, as being in Vacation-time; but gave
great hopes of a favourable Sentence in the beginning of <hi>October.</hi> Upon
which the Lords spake very high.<note place="margin">Which gives great
  offence.</note> And the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> with great Commotion, Swore
<hi>by the Mass, that, he saw it was true which had been commonly said, That
never Cardinal yet did good in England</hi>; and so all the Temporal Lords went
away in a fury, leaving the Legates, (<hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> especially) in no small
perplexity. <hi>Wolsey</hi> knew it would be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he understood this
before-hand, and that it would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for him, either to say he did
not know, or could not help it, all Apologies being ill heard by an enraged
Prince. <hi>Campegio</hi> had not much to lose in <hi>England</hi> but his
Bishoprick of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and the reward he expected from the King,
which he knew the Emperor and the Pope would plentifully make up to him. But
his Collegue was in a worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he had much to fear, because he had
much to lose: For as the King had severely chid him for the delays of the
business, so he was now to expect a heavy storm from him;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wolsey</hi>'s dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> and after so long an
Administration of Affairs by so insolent a Favourite, it was not to be doubted,
but as many of his Enemies were joyning against him, so matter must needs be
found to work his ruin with a Prince that was Alienated from him: 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104314:56"/> Therefore he was under all the disorders, which a fear
that was heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tned by Ambition and Covetousness could produce.</p>
            <p>But the King govern'd himself upon this occasion, with more temper
than could have been expected from a man of his humour: Therefore as he made no
great show of disturbance, so to divert his uneasie thoughts he went his
Progress. Soon after, he received his Agents Letter from <hi>Rome,</hi> and
made <hi>Gardiner</hi> (who was then Secretary of State) write to the Cardinal,
to put <hi>Campegio</hi> to his Oath, whether he had revealed the Kings Secrets
to the Pope, or not? And if he Swore he had not done it, to make him Swear he
should never do it. A little after that, the Messenger came from <hi>Rome</hi>
with a <hi>Breve</hi> to the Legates, requiring them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further,
and with an Avocation of the Cause to <hi>Rome</hi>; together with Letters
Citatory to the King and Queen to appear there in Person,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 4.</note> or by their Proxies. Of which when the
King was advertised, <hi>Gardiner</hi> wrote to the Cardinal by his order, That
the King would not have the Letters Citatory executed, or the Commission
discharged by vertue of them; but that upon the Popes <hi>Breve</hi> to them,
they should declare their Commission void: For he would not suffer a thing so
much to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his Crown, as a Citation be made to appear in another
Court, nor would he let his Subjects imagine that he was to be Cited out of his
Kingdom. This was the first step that he made for the lessening of the Popes
Power: Upon which the two Cardinals (for they were Legates no longer) went to
the King at <hi>Grafton.</hi> It was generally expected that <hi>Wolsey</hi>
should have been disgraced then, for not only the King was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him,
but he received new Informations of his having juggled in the business, and
that he secretly advised the Pope to do what was done. This was set about by
some of the Queens Agents, as if there was certain knowledge had of it at
<hi>Rome</hi>; and it was said, that some Letters of his to the Pope were by a
trick found and brought over to <hi>England.</hi> The Emperor lookt on the
Cardinal as his inveterate Enemy, and designed to ruin him if it was possible;
nor was it hard to perswade the Queen to concur with him to pull him down. But
all this seems an artifice of theirs only to destroy him. For the earnestness
the Cardinal expressed in this matter, was such, that either he was sincere in
it, or he was the best at dessembling that ever was. But these suggestions were
easily infused in the Kings angry mind, so strangely are men turned by their
affections, that sometimes they will believe nothing, and at other times they
believe every thing. Yet when the Cardinal with his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league came to Court,
they were received by the King with very hearty expressions of kindness; and
<hi>Wolsey</hi> was often in private with him, sometimes in presence of the
Council, and sometimes alone: once he was many hours with the King alone, and
when they took leave he sent them away very obligingly. But that which gave
Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> the most assurance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sept.</hi>
  23, in a Letter from the Cardinal, Secetary to <hi>Cromwell.</hi>
               </note> was
that all those who were admitted to the Kings privacies, did carry themselves
towards him as they were wont to do; both the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Sir
<hi>Thomas Boleyn</hi> then made Vis-count of <hi>Rochford,</hi> Sir <hi>Brian
Tuke</hi> and <hi>Gardiner</hi>: concluding that from the motions of such
Weather-cocks the air of the Princes affections was best gathered.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi> returns to
  Court.</note>
               <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi> was now brought to the Court again, out of
which she had been dismissed for some time, for silencing the noise, that her
being at Court, during the Process, would have occasioned. It is 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104314:56"/> taid, that she took her dismission so ill, that she
resolved never again so return; and that she was very hardly brought to it
afterwards, not without Threatnings from her Father. But of that nothing
appears to me; only this I find, that all her former kindness to the Cardinal,
was now turned to enmity, so that she was not wanting in her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to
pull him down.</p>
            <p>But the King being reconciled to her, and as it is ordinary after
some intermission and disorder between Lovers, his affection encreasing, he was
casting about for overtures, how to compass what he so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desired.
Sometimes he thought of procuring a new Commission; but that was not advisable,
for af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er a long dependance it
might end as the former had done. Then he thought of breaking off with the
Pope; but there was great danger in that, for besides that in his own
perswasion he adhered to all the most Important parts of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Religion, his subjects were so addicted to it, that any such a Change could not
but seem full of hazard. Sometime he inclined to Confederate himself with the
Pope and Emperor, for now there was no dividing of them, till he should thereby
bring the Emperor to yield to his desires. But that was against the Interests
of his Kingdom, and the Emperor had already proceeded so far in his Opposition,
that he could not be easily brought about.</p>
            <p>While his thoughts were thus divided, a new Proposition was made
to him that seemed the most reasonable and feasible of them all.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cranmers</hi> proposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Kings Divorce.</note>
There was one Dr. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who had been a Fellow of <hi>Iesus</hi>
Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi>; but having Married, forfeited his fellowship,
yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Studies, and was a Reader of Divinity in <hi>Buckingham</hi>
Colledge. His wife dying, he was again chosen Fellow of <hi>Iesus</hi>
Colledge; and was much esteemed in the University for his Learning, which
appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very eminently on all publick occasions. But he was a man that
neither courted Preferment, nor did willingly accept of it, when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. And
therefore though he was invited to be a Reader of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity in the Cardinals
Colledge at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he declined it. He was at this time forced to fly
out of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> from a Plague that was there, and having the Sons of
one Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> of <hi>Waltham</hi>-Cross com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Charge, he
went with his Pupils to their Fathers house at <hi>Waltham.</hi> There he was
when the King returned from his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, who took <hi>Waltham</hi> in his
way, and lay a night there. The Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers having appointed <hi>Gardiner</hi>
and <hi>Fox,</hi> the Kings Secretary, and Almoner, to ly at Mr.
<hi>Cressies</hi> house; it so happen'd that <hi>Cranmer</hi> was with them at
Supper. The whole discourse of <hi>England</hi> being then about the Divorce,
these two Courtiers, knowing <hi>Cranmer's</hi> Learning and solid Judgment,
entertained him with it, and desired to hear his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning it. He
modestly declined it; but told them, that he judged it would be a shorter and
safer way once to clear it well, if the Marriage was unlawful in it self, by
vertue of any divine Precept: For if that were proved, then it was certain,
that the Popes Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation could be of no force to make that lawful, which
God had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be unlawful. Therefore he thought that instead of a long
fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Negotiation at <hi>Rome,</hi> it were better to consult all the
Learned men, and the Universities of Christendome; for if they once declared it
in the Kings favours, then the Pope must needs give judgment, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104314:57"/> the Bull being of it self, null and void, the Marriage
would be found sinful, notwithstanding the Popes Dispensation. This seemed a
very good Motion, which they resolved to offer to the King; so next night when
he came to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> they proposed it to him; but with this
difference, that <hi>Gardiner</hi> had a mind to make it pass for their own
Contrivance, but <hi>Fox,</hi> who was of a more ingenuous Nature, told the
King from whom they had it.<note place="margin">Approved by the King.</note> He
was much affected with it, so soon as he heard it, and said, had he known it
sooner, it would have saved him a vast expence, and much trouble; and would
needs have <hi>Cranmer</hi> sent for to Court, saying in his coarse way of
speaking, <hi>That he had the Sow by the right ear.</hi> So he was sent for to
Court, and being brought before the King, he carryed himself so, that the King
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an high opinion of his Judgment, and Candour, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to
his death, and still payed a respect to him, beyond all the other Churchmen
that were about him: and though he made more use of <hi>Gardiner</hi> in his
Business, whom he found a man of great dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and Cunning; yet he never had
any respect for him. But for <hi>Cranmer,</hi> though the King knew that in
many things he differed from him, yet for all his being so impatient of
Contradiction, he always Reverenced him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And he much esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him.</note>He was soon
looked on as a Rising Churchman, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Cardinal was now
declining; for in the following <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-Term,</hi> the King sent for
the great Seal, which the Cardinal at first was not willing to part with. But
the next day the King wrote to him,<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
  fall.</note> and he presently delivered it to the Dukes of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and
<hi>Suffolk.</hi> It was offered back again to <hi>Warham,</hi> Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi>; but he being very old, and foreseeing great difficulties
in the keeping of it, excused himself. So it was given to Sr. <hi>Thomas
More,</hi> who was not only eminent in his own Profession, but in all other
Learning: and was much esteemed for the strictness of his life, and his
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Money. He was also the more fit to be made use of, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been in
ill terms with the Cardinal. Soon after, <hi>Hales</hi> the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourney-General,
put in an Information against the Cardinal, in the Kings Bench; bearing,
<hi>that notwithstanding the Statute of</hi> Richard the 2<hi>d, against the
Procuring Bulls from</hi> Rome, <hi>under the pains of</hi> Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire, <hi>yet
he had procured Bulls for his Legantine Power, which he had for many years
executed; and some particulars, for form, were named out of a great many
more.</hi> To this he put in his answer, by his Attorney, and confessed the
Indictment, but pleaded his ignorance of the Statute, and submitted himself to
the Kings mercy. Upon this it was declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he was out of the Kings
protection, and that he had forfeited his Goods and Chattells to the King, and
that his Person might be seized on. Then was his rich Palace of
<hi>York-house</hi> (now <hi>Whitehall</hi>) with all that vast wealth, and
Royal furniture that he had heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, (which was beyond any thing that
had ever been seen in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> before,) seized on for the King. But it
seems the King had not a mind to destroy him out right, but only to bring him
lower, and to try if the terror of that would have any influence on the
Pope:<note place="margin">

            <p>But as he had carryed his Greatness with most extravagant
pride,<note place="margin">The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Temper.</note> so he was no less
basely cast down with his misfortune; and having no ballast within himself, but
being wholly guided by things without him, he was lifted up, or cast down, as
the Scales of Fortune turned: yet his Enemies had gone too far, ever to suffer
a man of his parts or temper, to return to favour. And therefore they so
ordered it, that an high Charge of many Articles was brought against him, into
the House of Lords, in the Parliament that sate in <hi>November</hi> following;
and it passed there, where he had but few friends, and many and great enemies.
But when the charge was sent down to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, it was so managed
by the industry of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who had been his servant, that it came to
nothing. The heads of it have been oft printed, therefore I shall not repeat
them; they related chiefly to his Legantine Power, contrary to Law, to his
Insolence and Ambition, his lewd life, and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther things that were brought to
defame, as well as destroy him.</p>
            <p>All these things did so sink his proud mind, that a deep
melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overcame his Spirits. The King sent him frequent assurances of his
favour, which he received with extravagant transports of joy,<note place="margin">The King still <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the messenger that brought one of them, and holding up his hands for joy, which
shewed how mean a Soul he had, and that as himself afterwards acknowledged,
<hi>he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Kings favour, to God Almighties.</hi> But the King found
they took little notice of him at <hi>Rome</hi>; the Emperor hated him, and the
Pope did not love him, looking on him as one that was almost equal to himself
in Power: and though they did not love the Precedent to have a Cardinal so
used, yet they were not much troubled at <hi>Rome,</hi> to see it fall on him.
So in Easter-week, he was ordered to go North, though he had a great mind to
have stayed at <hi>Richmond,</hi> which the King had given him in Exchange for
<hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> that he had also built. But that was too near the
Court, and his enemies had a mind to send him further from it. Accordingly he
went to <hi>Cawood</hi> in <hi>York-shire,</hi> in which journey it appears,
that the ruins of his state were considerable, for he travelled thither with an
160 horse in his train, and 72 Carts following him, with his houshold

the King; but these did not work much on him, for whether it was that he knew
himself guilty of some secret Practises with the Pope, or with the Emperor,
which yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to the last; or whether he could no longer stand under the
Kings displeasure, and that change of condition; he was so cast down, that on
his way to <hi>London,</hi> he sickened at <hi>Sheffield</hi> Park, in the Earl
of <hi>Shrewsburies</hi> house, from whence by slow journeys he went as far as
<hi>Leicester,</hi> where after some days languishing he dyed; and at the last
made great Protestations <hi>of his having served the King faithfully, and 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104314:59"/> that he had little regarded the service of God, to do him
pleasure; but if he had served God as he had done him, he would not have given
him over so, as he did in his gray hairs. And he desired the King to reflect on
all his past services, and in particular, in his weighty matter</hi> (for by
that phrase, they usually spoke of the Kings Divorce) <hi>and then he would
find in his Conscience whether he had offended him or not.</hi>
               <note place="margin">And dies.</note> He dyed the 28 of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 1530. and
was the greatest Instance that several Ages had shown of the Variety and
Inconstancy of Humane things, both in his rise and fall; and by his temper in
both, it appears he was unworthy of his greatness, and deserved what he
suffered. But to conclude all that is to be said of him, I shall add what the
writer of his life ends it with. <hi>Here is the end and fall of Pride and
Arrogance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> 
               <hi>for I assure you,
in his time he was the haughtiest man in all his proceedings alive, having more
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the honour of his Person, than he had to his Spiritual Profession,
wherein should be shewed all meekness and charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A Parliament called.</note>But now with the
change of this great Minister, there followed a change of Counsels, and
therefore the King resolved to hold a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he might meet his
people, and establish such a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding between himself and them, that
he might have all secured at home; and then he resolved to proceed more
confidently abroad. There had been no Parliament for seven years, but the blame
of that, and of every other miscarriage, falling naturally on the disgraced
Minister, he did not doubt, that he should be able to give his people full
satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in that, and in every thing else. So a Parliament was summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to meet the 3d of <hi>November.</hi> And there, among several other Laws that
were made for the publick good of the Kingdom, there were Bills sent up by the
House of Commons, against some of the most exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant abuses of the Clergy:
one was against the Exactions for the Probates of Wills; another was for the
Regulating of Mortuaries; a third was about the Plurality of Benefices, and
non-residence, and Churchmens being Farmers of Lands. In the passing of these
Bills there were severe reflections made on the vices and corruptions of the
Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of that time, which were believed to flow from men that favoured
<hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine in their hearts.</p>
            <p>When these Bills were brought up to the House of Lords, the Bishop
of <hi>Rochester</hi> speaking to them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </note>
did reflect on the House of Commons: saying, that they were resolved to bring
down the Church, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired they would consider the miserable state of the
Kingdom of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> to which it was reduced by Heresie, and ended,
<hi>that all this was for lack of Faith.</hi> But this being afterwards known
to the House of Commons,<note place="margin">The House of Commons complains of
  the Bishop of <hi>Rochester.</hi>
               </note> they sent their speaker, Sr.
<hi>Thomas Audley,</hi> with 30 of their members, to complain to the King of
the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that their Acts flowed from the
<hi>want of Faith,</hi> which was an high Imputation on the whole Nation, when
the Representative of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was so charged, as if they had been Infidels
and Heathens. This was set on by the Court, to mortifie that Bishop, who was
unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, for his adhering so firmly to the Queens cause. The King
sent for the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and six other Bishops, and
before them told the complaint of the Commons. But the Bishop of
<hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> excused himself, and said, he only meant of the Kingdom of
<hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> when he said, <hi>all flowed from the want of Faith,</hi>
and did not at all <pb n="83" facs="tcp:104314:59"/> intend the House of Commons. This
Explanation the King sent by the Treasurer of his houshold, Sr. <hi>Will.
Fitz-Williams.</hi> But though the matter was passed over, yet they were not at
all satisfied with it, so that they went on, laying open the abuses of the
Clergy.</p>
            <p>In the House of Peers, great opposition was made to the
Bills,<note place="margin">Some Bills past reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abuses of the
  Clergy.</note> and the Clergy both within and without doors did defame them,
and said, these were the ordinary beginnings of Heresie, to complain of
Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and pretend Reformation, on purpose to disgrace the Clergy, from which
Heresie took it's chief strength. And the Spiritual Lords did generally oppose
them, the Temporal Lords being no less earnest to have them passed. The
Cardinal was admitted to sit in the House, where he showed himself as
submissive in his fauning as he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done in his scorn and contempt of
all who durst oppose him. But the King set the Bills forward, and in the end
they were agreed to by the Lords, and had the Royal Assent.</p>
            <p>The King intended by this, to let the Pope see what he could do if
he went on to offend him, and how willingly his Parliament would concur with
him, if it went to extremities. He did also endear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self much to the People,
by relieving them from the oppressions of the Clergy. But the Clergy lost much
by this means, for these Acts did not only lessen their present profits, but
did open the way for other things that were more to their detriment afterward.
Their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of this and all other motions for Reformation, did very much
encrease the prejudices that were conceived against them: whereas if such
motions had either risen from themselves, or had at least been cherished by
them, their Adversaries had not perhaps been so favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably heard; so fatally
did they mistake their true Interest, when they thought they were concerned, to
link with it all abuses and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>But there past another Bill in this Parliament,<note place="margin">  
                  <p>One Act discharging the King of his debts.</p> 
                  <p>Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.</p>
               </note> which because of its
singular nature, and that it was not printed with the other Statutes, shall be
found in the Collection of Instruments at the end. The Bill bore in a Preamble;
the highest flattery that could be put in Paper, of the great things the King
had done for the Church and Nation, in which he had been at vast Charges; and
that divers of the Supjects had lent great Sums of Money, which had been all
well employed in the publick Service: and whereas they had Security for their
Payment, the Parliament did offer all these Sums so lent to the King; and
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged him of all the obligations or assignations made for their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of all Suits that might arise thereupon.</p>
            <p>This was brought into the House by the Kings Servants, who
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged much on the wealth and peace of the Nation, notwithstanding the wars,
the King always making his enemies Countrey the scene of them; and shew'd that
for fourteen years, the King had but one Subsidy from his people; that now he
asked nothing for any other purpose, but only to be discharged of a Debt
contracted for the publick, the accounts whereof were shown, by which they
might see to what uses the Money so raised had been applyed. But there were
several ends in passing this Bill: those of the Court did not only intend to
deliver the King from a charge by it, but also to ruin all the Cardinals
friends and creatures, whom he had caused every-where to advance great Sums, 
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104314:60"/> for an Example to others. Others in the house that were
convinced that the Act was unjust in it self, yet did easily give way to it,
that they might effectually for the future discredit that way of raising Money
by Loans, as judging it to be the publick Interest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that no
sums of Money should be raised but by Parliament. So this Act passed, and
occasioned great Murmuring among all them that suffered by it. But to qualify
the general discontent, the King gave a free pardon to his Subjects for all
offences, some Capital ones only excepted, as is usual in such cases; and to
keep the Clergy under the Lash, all transgressions against the Statutes of
<hi>Provisors</hi> and <hi>Premunire</hi> were excepted, in which they were all
involved, as will afterwards appear. There are two other exceptions in this
Pardon, not fit to be omitted: the one is of the pulling or digging down
Crosses on the high wayes, which shews what a Spirit was then stirring among
the people; the other is of the Forfeitures that accrued to the King, by the
Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> that is, the Cardinals Colledge
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> with the Lands belonging to it which are excepted, upon
which the Dean and Canons resigned their Lands to the King, the Original of
which is yet extant: But the King founded the Colledge a-new soon after. All
this was done both to keep the Clergy quiet, and to engage them to use what
Interest they had in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to dispose the Pope to use the
King better in his great Suit. After those Acts were passed, on the 17 of
<hi>December,</hi> the Parliament was prorogued till <hi>April</hi> following;
yet it did not sit, till <hi>Ianuary</hi> after that, being continued by
several Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
            <p>There had been great industry used in carrying Elections for the
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and they were so successful, that the King was resolved to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it for some time. This great business being happily over, the Kings
thoughts turned next to affairs beyond Sea. The whole world was not at
peace.<note place="margin">

               </note> The Pope and the Emperor (as was said before) had made an
Alliance on terms of such advantage to the Pope, that as the Emperor did fully
repair all past injuries, so he laid new and great obligations on him: for he
engaged that he would assist him in the recovery of his Towns, and that he
would restore his Family to the Government of <hi>Florence,</hi> and invest his
Nephew in it, with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Duke,</hi> to whose Son he would Marry his
own natural Daughter; and that he would hold the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> of
the Papacy. These were the Motives that directed the Popes conscience, so
infallibly in the Kings business. Not long after that, in <hi>August</hi> an
other Peace was made in <hi>Cambray,</hi> between the Emperor and the
<hi>French</hi> King, and Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> the Emperors Aunt, and Regent
of <hi>Flanders</hi>: where the King first found the hollowness of the
<hi>French</hi> friendship and alliance; for he was not so much considered in
it as he expected,<note place="margin">

               </note> when there was no hope of succour
from <hi>France</hi>; and accordingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eleven Months Siege, it was taken,
and within a year after, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander de Medici</hi> was made Duke of it.
About the time that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror came to <hi>Bononia,</hi> news was brought,
that the Turk was forced to raise the Siege of <hi>Vienna</hi>; so that all
things concurred to raise his glory very high. At <hi>Bononia</hi> he would
needs receive the two Crowns of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that of
<hi>Milan,</hi> and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was done with all the
Magnificence possible, the Pope himself saying Mass both in <hi>Latine</hi> and
<hi>Greek.</hi> There is one ceremony of the Coronation, fit to be taken notice
of, in this work; that the Emperor was first put in the habit of a Canon of
<hi>Sancta Maria de la Torre</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that in the
habit of a Deacon, to make him be look't on as an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical person. This
had risen out of an Extravagant vanity of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
devised such rites to raise their reputation so high, that on the greatest
solemnity, the Emperor should appear in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the lowest of the Sacred
orders, by which he must know, that Priests and Bishops are above him. When the
Pope and he first met, the ceremony of kissing the Popes foot was much look't
for, and the Emperor very gently kneel'd to pay that submission; but the Pope
(whether it was that he thought it was no more seasonable to expect such
Complements, or more signally to oblige the Emperor) did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himself so far
as to draw in his foot, and kiss his cheek.</p>
            <p>But now the Divorce was to be managed in another method, and
therefore <hi>Cranmer,</hi> after he had discoursed with the King,<note place="margin">The King consults his Universities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</note>
about that Proposition which was formerly mentioned, was commanded by him to
write a Book for his opinion, and confirm it with as much Authority as he
could; and was recommended to the care of the Earl of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> and
<hi>Ormond</hi> (to which honor, the King had advanced Sr. <hi>Thomas
Boleyn</hi> in the right of his Mother) and in the beginning of the next year
he published his Book about it. <hi>Richard Crook</hi> (who was Tutor to the
Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi>) was sent into <hi>Italy,</hi> and others were sent
to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> to consult the Divines, Canonists, and
other Learned men in the Universities, about the Kings business. How the rest
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the matter, I have not yet been able to discover; but from a great
number of original Letters of Doctor <hi>Crooks,</hi> I shall give a full
account of his Negotiation. It was thought best to begin at home, and therefore
the King wrote to the two Universities in <hi>England,</hi> to send him their
conclusions about it. The matters went at <hi>Oxford</hi> thus. The Bishop of
<hi>Lincoln</hi> being sent thither with the Kings Letters for their
Resolution,<note place="margin">

               </note> it was by the Major vote
of the Convocation of all the Doctors and Masters, as well Regents as
non-Regents, committed to 33 Doctors and Batchelours of Divinity (who were
named by their own Facultie) or to the greater number of them, to determine the
Questions, that were sent with the Kings Letters, and to set the common Seal of
the University to their Conclusions: and by vertue of that War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, they did
on the 8 of <hi>April</hi> put the common Seal of the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to an
Instrument, declaring the Marriage of the Brothers wife, to be both contrary to
the Laws of God and Nature.<note place="margin">

  8.257.</note> The Collector of the Antiquities of <hi>Oxford,</hi> informs us
of the uneasiness that was in <pb n="86" facs="tcp:104314:61"/> the University in this
matter, and of the several messages the King sent, before that Instrument could
be procured, so that from the 12 of <hi>February</hi> to the 8 of
<hi>April,</hi> the matter was in agitation, the Masters of Arts generally
opposing it, though the Doctors and Heads were (for the greatest part) for it.
But after he has set down the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi>
  1<hi rend="sup">0.</hi> p. 225.</note> he gives some reasons (upon what design, I cannot easily
ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) to shew that this was extorted by force; and being done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the
consent of the Masters of Arts, was of it self void, and of no force: and as if
it had been an ill thing, he takes pains to purge the University of it, and
lays it upon the fears and corruptions of some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring men of the University:
and without any proof, gives credit to a lying Story set down by
<hi>Sanders,</hi> of an Assembly called in the night, in which the Seal of the
University was set to the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it appears that he had never seen
or considered the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, to which the University set their Seal,
that was agreed on in a Convocation of all the Doctors and Masters, as well
Regents as non-Regents; giving Power to these Doctors and Batchelors
ofDivinity, to determine the Matter, and to set the Seal of the University to
their Conclusion. The original whereof the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> saw, upon
which the persons so deputed, had full Authority to set the University Seal to
that Conclusion without a new Convocation. Perhaps that Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not so
carefully preserved among their Records, or was in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days
taken away, which might occasion these mistakes in their Historian.</p>
            <p>There seems to be also another mistake in the Relation he gives:
for he says, those of <hi>Paris</hi> had determined in this matter before it
was agreed to at <hi>Oxford.</hi> The Printed Decision of the <hi>Sorbone</hi>
contradicts this: for it bears date the 2d of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1530. whereas this
was done the 8th of <hi>April,</hi> 1530. But what passed at
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> I shall set down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more fully,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.</note> from an original Letter written
by <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Fox</hi> to the King in <hi>February</hi> (but the
day is not marked) When they came to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> they spake to the
Vice-Chancellor, whom they found very ready to serve the King; so was also
<hi>Bonner</hi> (whom they call Doctor <hi>Edmonds</hi>) and several
others,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
               </note> but there was a contrary party that
met together, and resolved to oppose them. A meeting of the Doctors, Batchelors
of Divinity, and Masters of Arts, in all about 200, was held. There the Kings
Letters were read, and the Vice-Chancellor calling upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them, to
deliver their opinions about it, they answered as their affections led them,
and were in some disorder. But it being propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that the answering the Kings
Letter, and the Questions in it, should be referred to some indifferent men;
great exceptions were made to Doctor <hi>Salcot,</hi> Doctor <hi>Reps,</hi> and
<hi>Crome,</hi> and all others who had approved Doctor <hi>Cranmers</hi> Book,
as having already declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves partial. But to that it was answered,
that after a thing was so much discoursed of, as the Kings matter had been, it
could not be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that any number of men could be found, who had not
declared their judgment about it, one way or another. Much time was spent in
the debate, but when it grew late, the Vice-Chancellor commanded every man to
take his place, and to give his voice, whether they would agree to the Motion
of referring it to a Select body of men: but that night they would not agree to
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:104314:61"/>The Congregation being Adjourned till next
day, the Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor offered a Grace (or Order) to refer the matter to 29
persons (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, 10 Doctors, and 16 Batchelors, and the 2 Proctors) That (the
Questions being publickly disputed) what two parts of three agreed to, should
be read in a Congregation, and without any further debate, the Common Seal of
the University should be set to it. Yet it was at first denyed; then being put
to the vote, it was carryed equally on both sides. But being a third time
proposed, it was carryed for the Divorce. Of which an account was presently
sent to the King, with a Schedule of their names to whom it was committed, and
what was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them, so that it was at length determined, though
not without opposition, <hi>That the King's Marriage was against the Law of

            <p>It is thought strange,<note place="margin">Though with great
  difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> that the King who was otherwise so absolute in
<hi>England,</hi> should have met with more difficulty in this matter at home,
than he did abroad. But the most reasonable account I can give of it, is, That
at this time there were many in the Universities, (particularly at
<hi>Cambridge</hi>) who were addicted to <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine. And of
those <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> was lookt on as the most Learned: So that <hi>Crome,
Shaxton, Latimer,</hi> and others of that Society favoured the Kings Cause;
besides that, <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi> had in the Dutchess of <hi>Alancon</hi>'s
Court (who inclined to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) received such impressions as made them
fear, that her Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and <hi>Cranmers</hi> Preferment would encourage
Heresie; to which the Universities were furiously averse, and therefore they
did resist all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions that might promote the Divorce.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Crooke</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> he being very

               </note> was first
sent to <hi>Venice</hi> to search the <hi>Greek</hi> Manuscripts that lay in
the Library of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and to examine the Decrees of the ancient
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: He went <hi>incognito</hi> without any Character from the King, only
he had a Letter Recommending him to the care of <hi>Iohn Cassali,</hi> then
Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador at <hi>Venice,</hi> to procure him an admittance into the Libraries
there. But in all his Letters he complained mightily of his Poverty, that he
had scarce whereby to live and pay the Copiers whom he imployed to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
passages out of MSS. He stayed some time at <hi>Venice,</hi> from whence he
went to <hi>Padua, Bononia,</hi> and other Towns, where he only talked with
Divines and Canonists about these questions: <hi>Whether the Precepts in</hi>
Leviticus, <hi>of the Degrees of Marriage, do still oblige Christians? And
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Popes Dispensation could have any force against the Law of
God?</hi> These he proposed in Discourse, without mentioning the King of
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or giving the least intimation, that he was sent by him,
till he once discovered their Opinions. But finding them generally inclining to
the Kings Cause, he took more courage and went to <hi>Rome</hi>; where he
sought to be made a <hi>Penitentiary Priest,</hi> that he might have the freer
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess into Libraries, and be lookt on as one of the Popes Servants. But at
this time the Earl of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> and <hi>Stokesley,</hi> (who was made
Bishop of <hi>London, Tonstall</hi> being Translated to <hi>Duresm,</hi>) were
sent by the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> Ambassadors both to the Pope and
Emperor. <hi>Cranmer</hi> went with them to justifie his Book in both these
Courts. <hi>Stokesley</hi> brought full Instructions to <hi>Crooke</hi> to
search the Writings of most of the Fathers on a great many passages of the
Scripture; and in particular to try, what they wrote on that Law in
<hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which provided, that <hi>when one <pb n="88" facs="tcp:104314:62"/>
died without Children, his Brother should marry his Wife to raise up Children
to him.</hi> This was most pressed against the King by all that were for the
Queen, as either an Abrogation of the other Law in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> or at
least a Dispensation with it in that particular Case. He was also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
the <hi>Iews</hi> about it; and was to Copy out every thing that he found in
any Manuscript of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers, relating to
the Degrees of Marriage. Of this labour he complained heavily, and said, That
though he had a great task laid on him, yet his allowance was so small, that he
was often in great straits. This I take notice of, because it is said by
others, That all the Subscriptions that he procured were bought. At this time
there were great Animosities between the Ministers whom the King imployed in
<hi>Italy</hi>; the two Families of the <hi>Cassali,</hi> and the
<hi>Ghinucci,</hi> hating one another. Of the former Family were the
Ambassadors at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at <hi>Venice.</hi> Of the other
<hi>Hierome</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and had been in several
Ambassies into <hi>Spain.</hi> His Brother <hi>Peter</hi> was also imployed in
some of the little Courts of <hi>Italy</hi> as the Kings Agent. Whether the
King out of Policy kept this hatred up to make them Spies one on another, I
know not. To the <hi>Ghinucci</hi> was <hi>Crooke</hi> gained, so that in all
his Letters he complained of the <hi>Cassali,</hi> as men that betraied the
Kings Affairs; and said that <hi>Iohn,</hi> then Ambassador at <hi>Venice,</hi>
not only gave him no assistance, but used him ill: and publickly discovered,
That he was imployed by the King; which made many who had formerly spoken their
minds freely, be more reserved to him. But as he wrote this to the King, he
begged of him, that it might not be known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he expected either
to be Killed, or Poisoned by them: Yet they had their Correspondents about the
King, by whose means they understood what <hi>Crooke</hi> had Informed against
them. But they wrote to the King, that he was so morose and ill-natured, that
nothing could please him; and to lessen his Credit, they did all they could to
stop his Bills. All this is more fully set down, than perhaps was necessary, if
it were not to show that he was not in a condition to corrupt so many Divines,
and whole Universities, as some have given out. He got into the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of a Frier at <hi>Venice, Franciscus Georgius,</hi> who had lived 49 years in a
Religious order, and was esteemed the most Learned man in the Republick, not
only in the vulgar Learning, but in the Greek and Hebrew, and was so much
accounted of by the Pope, that he called him <hi>the Hammer of Hereticks.</hi>
He was also of the Senatorian Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his Brother was Governor of
<hi>Padua,</hi> and payed all the Readers there. This Friar had a great opinion
of the King: and having stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the case,<note place="margin">Many

the other Divines of the Republick, among whom he had much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. <hi>Thomas
Omnibonus</hi> a Dominican, <hi>Philippus de Cremis</hi> a Doctor of the Law,
<hi>Valerius</hi> of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> and some others, wrote for the Kings
cause. Many of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Rabbins, did give it under their hands in
Hebrew, <hi>That the Laws of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, were thus to be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. That Law of Marrying the Brothers wife when he dyed without
Children, did only bind in the Land of</hi> Judaea, <hi>to preserve Families
and maintain their Successions in the Land, as it had been divided by Lot. But
that in all other places of the world, the Law of Leviticus, of not Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Brothers wife was obligatory.</hi> He also searched all the Greek MSS. of
Councils, and <hi>Nazianzens</hi> and <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> works. After that 
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104314:62"/> he run over <hi>Macarius, Acacius, Apollinaris, Origen,
Gregory Nyssen, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, Severian,</hi> and <hi>Gennadius</hi>; and copied out
of them all that which was pertinent to his purpose. He procured several hands
to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, before it was known that it was the Kings business, in
which he was employed. But the Government of <hi>Venice</hi> was so strict,
that when it was known whose Agent he was, he found it not easie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Subscriptions: Therefore he advised the King to order his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to procure
a Licence from the Senate, for their Divines, to declare their opinions in that
matter. Which being proposed to the Senate, all the answer he could obtain was,
<hi>that they would be Neutrals</hi>;<note place="margin">

  18.</note> and when the Ambassador pressed, as an evidence of Neutrality, that
the Senate would leave it free to their Divines, to declare of either side as
their Consciences led them; he could procure no other answer, the former being
again repeated. Yet the Senate making no Prohibition, many of their Divines put
their hands to the Conclusions. And <hi>Crook</hi> had that Success, that he
wrote to the King, he had never met with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine that did not favour his
cause: but the Conclusions touching the Popes Power, his Agents did every-where
discourage,<note place="margin"> 
                  <p>Though the Pope and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them. And the Emperors Ambassador at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> did threaten
<hi>Omnibonus</hi> for writing in prejudice of the Popes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and
asserting conclusions, which would make most of the Princes of Europe
<hi>Bastards.</hi> He answered, he did not consider things as a Statesman, but
as a Divine. 
<q>Yet to take off this fear, <hi>Crook</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested to the
  King, to order his Minister at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a
  <hi>Breve</hi> that Divines or Canonists might without fear or hazard, deliver
  their opinions according to their Consciences, requiring them under the pain of
  Excommunication, that they should write nothing for gain or Partial affections,
  but say the pure and simple truth, without any artifice, as they would answer
  to God in the great day of Judgment.</q> This seemed so fair, that it might
have been expected, the Successor of St. <hi>Peter</hi> would not deny it; yet
it was not easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, though the King wrote a very earnest Letter to the
Bishop of <hi>Verona,</hi> to assist his Minister in procuring it.<note place="margin">

For at <hi>Rome,</hi> though they knew not well how to oppose this method,
because it seem'd so very reasonable; yet they had great apprehensions of it,
because they thought it was designed to force the Pope to determine as the King
pleased: and they abhorred the President, that a company of poor Friars, should
Dictate to them in matters of this nature.<note place="margin">

<hi>That the Law in</hi> Leviticus <hi>did bind all mankind,</hi> and says,
<hi>That Law of a Brothers Marrying his Sister-in-Law, was a Dispensation given

               </note> But <hi>Bucer</hi> was of another mind, and thought
the Law in <hi>Leviticus</hi> did not bind, and could not be Moral, because God
had dispensed with it in one Case, <hi>of raising up seed to his Brother</hi>:
There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought these Laws belonged only to that Dispensation, and did no
more bind Christians, than the other Ceremonial or Judiciary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; and
that to Marry in some of these Degrees, was no more a sin, than it was a sin in
the Disciples to pluck Ears of Corn on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. There are none of
<hi>Bucers</hi> Letters remaining on this Head, but by the answers that
<hi>Grineus</hi> wrote to him, one on the 29th of <hi>August,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104314:65"/> of the 10th of <hi>September,</hi> I gather his Opinion,
and the reasons for it. But they all agreed, That the Popes Dispensation was of
no force to alter the nature of the thing. <hi>Paulus Phrygion</hi> was of
Opinion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phrygion.</hi>
               </note> That the Laws in
<hi>Leviticus</hi> did bind all Nations, because it is said in the Text,
<hi>That the</hi> Canaanites <hi>were punished for doing contrary to them,
which did not consist with the Iustice of God, if those Prohibitions had not
been parts of the Law of Nature.</hi> Dated <hi>Basil</hi> the 10th of
<hi>September.</hi> In <hi>Grineus</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Bucer,</hi> he tells
him, that the King had said to him, <hi>That now for seven years he had

                  <hi>Zuinglius.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Zuinglius</hi> Letter is very full.
First, he largely proves that neither the Pope, nor any other Power could
dispence with the Law of God: Then, that the Apostles had made no new Laws
about Marriage, but had left it as they found it: That the Marrying within near
degrees was hated by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and other Heathen Nations. But
whereas <hi>Grineus</hi> seemed to be of opinion, that though the Marriage was
ill made, yet it ought not to be dissolved, and inclined rather to advise that
the King should take another Wife, keeping the Queen still; <hi>Zuinglius</hi>
confutes that, and says, If the Marriage be against the Law of God, it ought to
be dissolved: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Queen should be put away honourably, and still
used as a Queen; and the Marriage should only be dissolved for the future,
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Illegitimating the Issue begotten in it, since it had gone on in a
pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick way, upon a received error. But advises, that the King should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in a Judiciary way, and not establish so ill a President as to put away his
Queen, and take another without due form of Law. Dated <hi>Basil,</hi> 17th of
<hi>Aug.</hi> There is a second Letter of his to the same purpose from
<hi>Zurick,</hi> the first of <hi>September.</hi> There is also with these
Letters a long paper of <hi>Osianders</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the form of a Direction how
the Process should be managed.</p>
            <p>There is also an Epistle of <hi>Calvins,</hi> published among the
rest of his. Neither the date nor the person to whom it was directed are
named.<note place="margin">And <hi>Calvin Epist.</hi> 384.</note> Yet I fancie it
was written to <hi>Grineus,</hi> upon this occasion: <hi>Calvin</hi> was clear
in his judgment that the Marriage was null, and that the King ought to put away
the Queen, upon the Law of <hi>Leviticus.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it was objected,
that the Law is only meant <hi>of Marrying the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife while he is yet
alive</hi>; he shews that could not be admitted, for all the prohibited degrees
being forbidden in the same style, they were all to be understood in one sense:
Therefore since it is confessed, that it is unlawful to Marry in the other
degrees, after the death of the <hi>Father, Son, Uncle,</hi> or
<hi>Nephew,</hi> so it must be also a sin, to Marry the Brothers wife after his
death. And for the Law in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Brothers
wife to raise up seed to him</hi>; he thought, that by <hi>Brother</hi> there,
is to be understood a <hi>near Kinsman,</hi> according to the usual phrase of
the Hebrew tongue: and by that he reconciles the two Laws which otherwise seem
to differ, illustrating his Exposition by the History of <hi>Ruth</hi> and
<hi>Boaz.</hi> It is given out that <hi>Melancthon</hi> advised the Kings
tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another wife, justifying <hi>Polygamy from the old Testament</hi>; but
I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe it. It is true the Lawfulness of <hi>Polygamy</hi> was much
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted at this time. And as in all controversies newly started, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
crude things are said; so some of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> and <hi>German</hi>
Divines seem not so fierce against it; though none of them went so far as the
Pope did,<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Herb.</hi> from an Orig. Let.
  <hi>Sept.</hi> 18. 1530.</note> who did plainly offer to grant the King Licence
to have two wives: and it was a motion the Imperialists consented to, and
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, <pb n="94" facs="tcp:104314:66"/> though upon what reason, the Ambassador
<hi>Cassali,</hi> who wrote the account of it to the King, could not learn. The
Pope forbade him to write about it to the King, perhaps as Whisperers enjoyn
silence, as the most effectual way to make a thing publick. But for
<hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthons</hi> being of that mind, great evidences appear to the
contrary; for there is a Letter of <hi>Osianders</hi> to him, giving him many
reasons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to approve of the Kings putting away the Queen, and
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying another: the Letter also shews he was then of opinion, that the Law
in <hi>Leviticus</hi> was Dispensable.</p>
            <p>And after the thing was done, when the King desired the
<hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines to approve his second Marriage;<note place="margin">The

when it was done, cannot be imagined to have advised <hi>Polygamy</hi> before

<hi>Germany,</hi> to approve of the Divorce, and the subsequent Marriage of
<hi>Anne Boleyn</hi>; he found that <hi>Melancthon</hi> and others had no mind
to enter much into the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about it, both for fear of the Emperor, and
because they judged the King was led in it by dishonest affections: they also
thought the Laws in <hi>Leviticus</hi> were not Moral, and did not oblige
Christians, and since there were no Rules made about the Degrees of Marriage in
the Gospel, they thought Princes and States might make what Laws they pleased
about it: yet a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It cannot be denyed, that the Protestants did express great
sincerity in this matter: such as became men of conscience, who were acted by
true Principles, and not by maxims of Policie. For if these had governed them,
they had struck in more compliantly with so great a Prince, who was then
alienated from the Pope, and in very ill terms with the Emperor: so that to
have gained him by a full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to have protected them, was the wisest
thing they could do; and their being so cold in the matter of his Marriage, in
which he had engaged so deeply, was a thing, which would very much provoke him
against them. But such measures as these, though they very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the

  found just, which ought to prevail so far with the Pope, that though none moved
  in it, and notwithstanding any Contradiction, he ought to confirm their
  judgment; especially it touching a King and Kingdom, to whom he was so much
  obliged. But since neither the justice of the cause, nor the Kings most earnest
  desires had prevailed with him, they were all forced to complain of that
  strange usage of their King; who both by his Authority, and with his Pen, had
  supported the Apostolick See, and the Catholick Faith, and yet was now denyed
  justice. From which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended great mischief and Civil Wars, which
  could only be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Kings Marrying another wife, of whom he might
  have issue. This could not be done, till his present Marriage were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled. 
  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:104314:67"/> nulled. And if the Pope would still refuse to do this,
  they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they were abandoned by him, and so seek for other
  Remedies. This they most earnestly prayed him to prevent, since they did not
  desire to go to extremities, till there was no more to be hoped for at his

answer, the 27 of <hi>September.</hi> 
               <q>He took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the vehemency of their Letter, which he
  forgave them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting it to their great affection to their King: they had
  charged him with ingratitude and injustice; two grievous Imputations. He
  ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged all they wrote of the obligations he owed to their King, which
  were far greater than they called them, both on the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick See, and
  himself in particular. But in the Kings cause he had been so far from denying
  justice, that he was oft charged as having been too partial to him. He had
  granted a Commission to two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to hear it, rather out of favour, than in
  Rigor of Law; upon which the Queen had appealed: he had delayed the admitting
  of it, as long as was possible; but when he saw it could not be any longer
  denyed to be heard, it was brought before the Consistory, where all the
  Cardinals with one consent, found that the Appeal, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the
  cause must be granted. That since that time, the King had never desired to put
  it to a Tryal, but on the contrary, by his Ambassadors at <hi>Bononia</hi>
  moved for a delay: and in that posture it was still, nor could he give sentence
  in a thing of such Consequence, when it was not so much as sought for. For the
  conclusions of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities and Learned men, he had seen none of them from any
  of the Kings Ambassadors. It was true some of them had been brought to him
  another way; but in them there were no reasons given, but only bare
  Conclusions, and he had also seen very important things for the other side; and
  therefore he must not precipitate a Sentence, in a cause of such high
  Importance, till all things were fully heard and considered. He wished their
  King might have Male Issue, but he was not in Gods stead to give it. And for
  their Threatnings of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other Remedies, they were neither agreeable to
  their wisdom, nor to their Religion. Therefore he admonished them to abstain
  from such Counsels; but minded them that it is not the Physicians fault, if the
  Patient will do himself hurt. He knew the King would never like such courses;
  and though he had a just value for their Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet he considered the
  King much more, to whom as he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver denyed any thing, that he could grant
  with his honor; so he was very desirous to examine this matter, and to put it
  to a speedy issue, and would do every thing that he could without offending
  God.</q>

                           <hi>Waldensis,</hi> charged him with
  Heresie, for denying that those Prohibitions did oblige Christians. And
  asserted that they were Moral Laws, which obliged all Mankind. And the Books of
  <hi>Waldensis</hi> were approved by <hi>P. Martin</hi> the First. There were
  also many Quotations brought out of <hi>Petrus de Tarantasia, Durandus,
  Stephanus Brulifer, Richardus de Media Villa, Guido Briancon, Gerson, Paulus
  Ritius,</hi> and many others, to confirm the same Opinion, who did all
  unanimously assert, That those Laws in <hi>Leviticus</hi> are parts of the Law
  of Nature, which oblige all Mankind, and that Marriages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in these
  Degrees are null and void. All the Canonists were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the same mind,
  <hi>Ioannes Andreas, Ioannes de Imola, Abbas Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normitanus,</hi>

                           <hi>Mattheus Neru, Vincentius,

  still in force, and could not be Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with.</p>
                        <p>There was also a great deal alledged, to prove that a
  Marriage is compleated by the Marriage-Contract,<note place="margin">Marriage
 compleated by Consent.</note> though it be never Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. Many Authorities
  were brought to prove that <hi>Adonijah</hi> could not Marry <hi>Abishag,</hi>
  because she was his Fathers Wife, though never known by him. And by the Law of
  <hi>Moses</hi> a woman espoused to a man, if she admitted another to her Bed,
  was to be stoned as an <hi>Adulteress</hi>; from whence it appears, that the
  validity of Marriage is from the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Covenant. And though <hi>Ioseph</hi>
  never knew the Blessed Virgin, yet he was so much her Husband by the Espousals,
  that he could not put her away, but by a Bill of Divorce: and was afterwards
  called her Husband, and Christs Father. Affinity had been also defined by all
  writers, <hi>a Relation arising out of Marriage,</hi> and since Marriage was a
  <hi>Sacrament of the Church,</hi> its Essence could only consist in the
  Contract; and therefore as a man in Orders has the Character, though he never
  Consecrated any Sacrament: So Marriage is compleat, though its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect never
  follow. And it was shewed that the Canonists had only brought in the
  Consummation of Marriage as essential to it by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Law. But that as
  <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were perfectly Married before they knew one
  another, so Marriage was compleat upon the Contract; and what followed, was
  only an effect done in the right of the Marriage. And there was a great deal of
  filthy stuff brought together, of the different Opinions of the Canonists
  concerning Consummation, to what Degree it must go, to shew that it could not
  be essential to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  <hi>Tribur,</hi> defined, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was compleated by the Consent, and the

  lawfully Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to him, the King could not afterwards Marry her.</p>
                        <p>It was also said, that <hi>violent presumptions</hi> were
  sufficient in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Canonists to prove Consummation. Formal
  proofs could not be expected; and for Persons that were of Age, and in good
  health, <pb n="101" facs="tcp:104314:69"/> to be in Bed together, was in all Trials about
  Consummation, all that the Cononists sought for. And yet this was not all in
  this Case, for it appeared that, upon her Husbands death, she was kept with
  great care by some Ladies, who did think her with Child; and she never said any
  thing against it. And in the Petition offered to the Pope in her name,
  (repeated in the Bull that was procured for the Second Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,) it is said,
  she was <hi>perhaps known by Prince</hi> Arthur, and in the Breve, it is
  plainly said, she was known by Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> and though the Queen
  offered to purge her self by Oath, that Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew her,
  it was proved by many Authorities out of the Canon-Law, That a Partie's Oath
  ought not to be taken, when there were <hi>violent presumptions</hi> to the
  contrary.</p>
                        <p>As for the validity of the Popes Dispensation, it was
  said, That though the Schoolmen and Canonists did generally raise the Popes
  Power very high, and stretch it as far as it was possible;<note place="margin">The Popes Dispensation of no force.</note> yet they all agreed
  that it could not reach the Kings Case: Upon this received Maxime, <hi>That
  only the Laws of the Church are subject to the Pope, and may be dispenced with

  them in any case.</hi>

  dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with Marriage in these Degrees, because it is against Nature. But
  <hi>Ioannes de Turre Cremata,</hi> reports a singular Case, which fell out when
  he was a Cardinal. A King of <hi>France</hi> desired a Dispensation to Marry
  his Wives Sister. The matter was long considered of, and debated in the
  <hi>Rota,</hi> himself being there, and bearing a share in the Debate; but it
  was concluded, <hi>That if any Pope either out of Ignorance, or being
  Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, had ever granted such a Dispensation, that could be no president or
  warrant for doing the like any more, since the Church ought to be governed by
  Laws, and not by such Examples. Antonin,</hi> and <hi>Ioannes de Tabia,</hi>
  held the same. And one <hi>Bacon</hi> an <hi>English-man,</hi> who had taught
  the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was censured for it even at <hi>Rome,</hi> and he did retract
  his Opinion, and acknowledged, that the Pope could not dispence with the
  Degrees of Marriage forbidden by the Law of God.</p>
                        <p>The Canonists agree also to this, both <hi>Ioannes

  That the Precepts in <hi>Leviticus</hi> oblige for ever, and therefore cannot
  be dispenced with. And <hi>Panormitan</hi> says, <hi>These things are to be

  <hi>Alexander the</hi> 3d. would not suffer a Citizen of <hi>Pavia</hi> to
  Marry his younger Son, to the Widow of his eldest Son, though he had Sworn to
  do it. For the Pope said, it was against the Law of God, therefore it might not
  be done, and he was to repent of his unlawful Oath.</p>
                        <p>And for the Power of dispencing even with the Laws of the
  Church, by Popes; it was brought in, in the latter Ages. All the Fathers with
  one consent believed, That the Laws of God could not be dispenced with by the
  Church, for which many places were cited out of St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Basil,
  Ambrose, Isidore, Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Urban, Fabian, Marcellus,</hi> and
  <hi>Innocent,</hi> that were Popes; besides an infinite number of latter
  Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And also the Popes <hi>Zosimus, Damasus, Leo,</hi> and
  <hi>Hilarius</hi> did free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge they could not change the Decrees of
  the Church, nor go against the Opinions or Practices of the Fathers. And since
  the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles <pb n="102" facs="tcp:104314:70"/> confessed, <hi>they could do nothing
  against the truth, but for the truth</hi>; the Pope being Christs Vicar, cannot
  be supposed to have so great a Power as to abrogate the Law of God: and though
  it is acknowledged, that he is Vested with a <hi>fulness of Power,</hi> yet the
  phrase must be restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the matter of it, which is the Pastoral care of
  Souls. And though there was no Court Superiour to the Popes, yet as St.
  <hi>Paul</hi> had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood St. <hi>Peter</hi> to his face; so in all Ages
  upon several occasions, holy Bishops have refused to comply with, or submit to

  Threatnings, to let it alone, and Absolve him. <hi>Dunstan</hi> did the like to
  Count <hi>Edwin</hi> for an other Incestuous Marriage; nor did all the Popes
  Interposition make him give over. They found many other such instances which
  occurred in the Ecclesiastical History, of Bishops proceeding by Censures and
  o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Methods, to stop the course of Sin, notwithstanding any encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
  the Parties had from Popes.</p>
                        <p>And it is certain, that every man when he finds himself
  engaged in any course, which is clearly sinful, ought presently to forsake it,
  ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of all Divines. And therefore the King upon these
  Evidences of the unlawfulness of his Marriage ought to abstain from the Queen;
  and the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with the other Bishops, ought to
  require him to do it, otherwise they must proceed to Church Censures. Many
  things were also brought from reason (or at least the Maximes of the School
  Philosophy, which passed for true reason in those days,) to prove Marriage in
  the degrees forbidden by <hi>Moses</hi> to be contrary to the Law of Nature;
  and much was alledged out of Profane Authors, to show what an abhorrency some
  Heathen Nations had of Incestuous Marriages.</p>
                        <p>And whereas the chief strength of the Arguments for the
  contrary opinion,<note place="margin">The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</note> rested
  in this, That these Laws of <hi>Moses</hi> were not confirmed by
  <hi>Christ</hi> or his Apostles in the New Testament. To that they answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
  That if the Laws about Marriage were Moral, as had been proved, then there was
  no need of a particular Confirmation, since those Words of our Saviour: <hi>I
  came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it</hi>; do confirm the whole Moral
  Law. Christ had also expresly asserted the Relation of Affinity, saying,
  <hi>That man and wife are one Flesh.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> also condemned a
  Match as Incestuous for Affinity. But though it were not expresly set down in
  the Gospel, yet the Traditions of the Church, are received with equal Authority
  to written Verities. This the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Learned
  Writers for the Catholick Faith, lay down as a Fundamental Truth. And without
  it, how could the Seven Sacraments (some of which are not mentioned in the New
  Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,) with many other Articles of Catholick Belief be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
  against the Hereticks. The Tradition of the Church being so full and formal in
  this particular, must take place: And if any Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been brought in
  by some Popes within an Age or two, which have never had any other Authority
  from the Decrees of the Church, or the Opinions of Learned men, they are not to
  be maintained in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the Evidence that is brought on the other
  side.</p>

               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:104314:70"/>This I have summed up in as short and
Comprehensive words as I could, Being the Substance of what I gathered out of
the Printed Books and Manuscripts for the Kings cause. But the Fidelity of an
Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an leads me next to open the arguments that were brought against it, by
those who wrote on the other side for the Queens cause, to prove the validity
of the Marriage, and the Popes Power of Dispensing with a Marriage in that
degree of Affinity.</p>
            <p>I could never by all the search I have made, see either MSS. or
Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Books that defended their Cause, except <hi>Cajetans</hi> and
<hi>Victorias</hi> Books that are Printed in their works. But from an answer
that was written to the Bishop of <hi>Rochesters</hi> Book, and from some other
writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on the other side, I gather the Substance of their arguments to have
been what follows.</p>
            <q> 
               <p> Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> had by many arguments endeavored to
prove,<note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Marriage.</note> that the
Prohibitions in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> were not parts of the Moral Law. They were
not observed before the Law, no not by the holy seed. <hi>Adams</hi> Children
Married one another, <hi>Abraham</hi> Married his Sister, <hi>Iacob</hi>
Married two Sisters, <hi>Iudah</hi> gave his two Sons to <hi>Tamar,</hi> and
promised to give her the third for her Husband. By the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> a
Dispensation was granted in one case, for Marrying the Brothers wife, which
shows the Law was not Moral, otherwise it could not be dispenced with, and if
<hi>Moses</hi> dispensed with it, why might not the Pope as well do it, nor was
there any force in the places cited from the New Testament. As for that of
<hi>Herod,</hi> both <hi>Iosephus</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> witness, that his
Brother <hi>Philip</hi> was alive when he took his wife, and so his sin was
Adultery and not Incest. We must also think that the Incestous Person in
<hi>Corinth,</hi> took his Fathers Wife when he was yet living, otherwise if he
had been dead, St. <hi>Paul</hi> could not say it was <hi>a Fornication not
named among the Gentiles,</hi> for we not only find both among the
<hi>Persians</hi> and other Nations, the Marriage of Step-Mothers allowed, but
even among the <hi>Iews, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah</hi> desired <hi>Abisha</hi> in Marriage,
who had been his Fathers Concubine.</p> 
               <p> From all which they concluded, that the Laws about the Degrees of
Marriage, were only Judiciary Precepts, and so there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obligation
on Christians to obey them, than what flowed from the Laws of the Church, with
which the Pope might dispense. They also said, that the Law in
<hi>Leviticus</hi> of not taking the Brothers wife, must be understood of not
taking her, while he was alive; for after he was dead, by another Law, a man
might marry his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife.</p> 
               <p> They also pleaded, that the Popes Power, of Dispensing, did reach
further than the Laws of the Church, even to the Law of God, for he daily
Dispensed with the Breaking of Oaths and Vows, though that was expresly
contrary to the Second Commandment, and though the Fifth Command, <hi>Thou
shalt do no Murther,</hi> be against Killing, yet the Pope Dispensed with the
putting Thieves to death, and in some cases, where the reason of the
Commandment does not at all times hold, he is the only judge according to
<hi>Summa Angelica.</hi> They Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Popes Power of Dispensing was as
necessary, as his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Expounding the Scriptures, and since there was a
Question made concerning the obligation of these Levitical Prohibitions,
whether <pb n="104" facs="tcp:104314:71"/> they were Moral,<note place="margin">1529.</note>
and did oblige Christians or not? the Pope must be the only Judge: There were
also some late Presidents found, one of P. <hi>Martin,</hi> who in the case of
a mans having Marryed his own Sister, who had lived long with her, upon a
Consultation with Divines and Lawyers, Confirmed it: to prevent the Scandal,
which the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving of it would have given. Upon which St. <hi>Antonin</hi>
of <hi>Florence</hi> says, that since the thing was dispensed with, it was to
be refered to the judgment of God, and not to be condemned.</p> 
               <p> The Pope had granted this Dispensation, upon a very weighty
Consideration, to keep peace between two great Crowns; it had now stood above
Twenty years: it would therefore raise an high scandal, to bring it under
debate; besides that it would do much hurt, and bring the Titles to most Crowns
into Controversie.</p> 
               <p> But they Concluded, that whatever Informalities or Nullities were
pretended to be in the Bulls or Breves, the Pope was the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge
of it, and that it was too high a presumption for infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Prelates, to take
upon them to examine or discuss it.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers made to h ese.</note>But to these
Arguments it was Answered by the writers for the Kings cause, that it was
strange to see men, who pretended to be such Enemies to all Heretical
Novelties, yet be guilty of that, which Catholick Doctors hold to be the
foundation of all Heresie; which was the setting up of private senses of
Scripture, and Reasonings from them, against the Doctrine and Tradition of the
Church. It was fully made out, that the Fathers and Doctors of the Church did
universally agree in this, that the Levitical Prohibitions of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of
Marriage are Moral, and do oblige all Christians. Against this Authority
<hi>Cajetan</hi> was the first that presumed to write, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his private
conceits to the Tradition of the Church: which is the same thing, for which
<hi>Luther</hi> and his followers are so severely Condemned. May it not then be
justly said of such men, that they plead much for Tradition, when it makes for
them, but reject it when it is against them? Therefore all these exceptions are
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, with this one Maxime of Catholick Doctrine, <hi>That they are
Novelties against the constant Tradition of the Christian Church, in all
Ages.</hi> But if the force of them be also examined, they will be found as
weak, as they are New. That before the Law, these degrees were not observed,
proves only, that they are not evidently contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Common sense of all
men; But as there are some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precepts, which have that natural evidence in
them, that all men must discern it, so there are others, that are drawn from
publick inconvenience and dishonesty, which are also parts of the Law of
nature: These Prohibitions are not of the first, but of the second sort, since
the Immorality of them appears in this, that the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities and freedoms
among near Relations are such, that if an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror were not struck in men at
conjunctures in these degrees, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies would be much defiled. This is the
Foundation of the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Marriages in these degrees: Therefore it is
not strange if men did not apprehend it, before God made a Law concerning it.
Therefore all examples before the Law, show only the thing is not so evident,
as to be easily collected by the light of Nature. And for the story of
<hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Tamar,</hi> there is so much wickedness in all the 
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104314:71"/> parts of it,<note place="margin">1531.</note> that it will
be very hard to make a President out of any part of it. As for the Provision
about Marrying the Brothers wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,
that only proves, the ground of the Law is not of its own Nature Immutable, but
may be Dispensed with by God in some cases. And all these Moral Laws, that are
founded on publick conveniency and honesty, are Dispensable by God in some
cases; but because <hi>Moses</hi> did it by Divine Revelation, it does not
follow, that the Pope can do it by his Ordinary Authority.</p> 
               <p> For that about <hi>Herod,</hi> it is not clear from
<hi>Iosephus,</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> was alive when <hi>Herod</hi> Marryed
his Wife. For all that <hi>Iosephus</hi> says, is, that she separated from her
Husband, when he was yet alive, and divorced her self from him. But he does not
say, that he lived still after she Marryed his Brother. And by the Law of
Divorce Marriage was at an end, and broken by it as much, as if the Party had
been dead, So that, in that case she might have Marryed any other: Therefore
<hi>Herods</hi> sin in taking her, was from the Relation of having been his
Brothers Wife. And for the Incestuous person in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> it is as
certain, that though some few Instances of a King of <hi>Syria</hi> and some
others, may be brought of Sons Marrying their Step-Mothers, yet these things
were generally ill looked on, even where they were practised by some Princes,
who made their Pleasure their Law. Nor could the Laws of <hi>Leviticus</hi> be
understood, of not Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Brothers wife when he was alive; for it was
not Lawful to take any mans Wife from him living. Therefore that cannot be the
meaning. And all those Prohibitions of Marriage in other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, excluding
those Marriages simply, whether during the life, or after the death of the
Father, Son, Uncle, and other such Relations, there is no ground to disjoynt
this so much from the rest, as to make it only extend to a Marriage before the
Husbands death. And for any Presidents that were brought, they were all in the
latter Ages, and were never Confirmed by any publick Authority. Nor must the
Practices of later Popes be laid in the Ballance against the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of
former Popes, and the Doctrine of the whole Church; and as to the Power that
was ascribed to the Pope, that began now to be enquired into with great
Freedom, as shall appear afterwards.</p>
            </q>
            <p>These Reasons on both sides being thus opened,<note place="margin">The Queen still intracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> the Censures of them, it is
like, will be as different now, as they were then: for they prevailed very
little on the Queen, who still persisted to justifie her Marriage, and to stand
to her Appeal.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </note> And though the King
carryed it very kindly to her in all outward appearance, and employed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body that had credit with her, to bring her to submit to him, and to pass from
her Appeal, remitting the Decision of the matter to any Four Prelates, and Four
Secular men in <hi>England,</hi> she was still unmovable and would hearken to
no Proposition. In the judgments that people passed, the Sexes were divided;
the Men generally approved the Kings cause, and the Women favoured the
Queen.<note place="margin">A Session of Parliament.</note> But now the Session of
Parliament came on the Sixteenth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and there the King first
brought in to the House of Lords, the Determination of the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and
the Books that were written for his cause by Forreigners. After they were read
and Considered there, the Lord Chancellor did on the 20th of
<hi>March,</hi>

them what the Universities and Learned men beyond Sea, had written for the
Divorce, and produced Twelve Original Papers, with the Seals of the
Universities to them, which Sr. <hi>Brian Tuke</hi> took out of his hand, and
read openly in the House, Translating the Latine into English. Then about an
Hundred Books written by Forreign Divines, for the Divorce, were also showed
them; none of which were read, but put off to another time, it being late. When
that was done, the Lord Chancellor desired they would report in their
Countries, <hi>what they had heard and seen, and then all men should clearly
perceive, that the King hath not attempted this matter of Will and Pleasure, as
strangers say, but only for the Discharge of his Conscience, and the Security
of the Succession to the Crown.</hi> Having said that, he left the House. The
matter was also brought before the Convocation;<note place="margin">Convocation.</note> and they having weighed all that was said on
both sides, seemed satisfied, that the Marriage was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and that the
Bull was of no force; more not being required at that time.</p>

by the Law; and this matter, being excepted out of the Pardon that was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the former Parliament, was at this time set on foot: Therefore an Indictment
was brought into the Kings Bench, against all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>England,</hi>
for breaking the Statutes against Provisions or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. But to open this
more clearly,</p>

  <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</note>It is to be Considered,
that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> having claimed in all Ages, a Power in
Ecclesiastical Matters, equal to what the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors had in that
Empire, they exercised this Authority both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Clergy and Laity: and did
at first erect Bishopricks, grant Investitures in them, call Synods, make Laws,
about Sacred as well as Civil Concerns: and in a word, they Governed their
whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Yet when the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> did stretch their Power
beyond either the limits of it in the Primitive Church, or what was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
granted them by the Roman Emperors; and came to assume an Authority in all the
Churches of <hi>Europe</hi>; as they found some Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance every where, so
they met with a great deal in this Kingdom; and it was with much Difficulty,
that they gained the Power of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Investitures, Receiving Appeals to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and of sending Legates to <hi>England,</hi> with several other
things, which were long contested, but were delivered up at length, either by
feeble Princes, or when Kings were so engaged at home or abroad, that it was
not safe for them to offend the Clergy. For in the first Contest between the
Kings and the Popes, the Clergy were generally on the Popes side, because of
the Immunity and Protection they enjoyed from that See, but when Popes became
ambitious and warlike Princes, then new Projects and Taxes were every where set
on foot, to raise a great Treasure. The Pall, with many Bulls and high
Compositions for them,<note place="margin">The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment of the
  Papacy.</note> Annates or first Fruits, and Tenths were the standing Taxes of
the Clergy, besides <pb n="107" facs="tcp:104314:72"/> many new ones upon emergent
occasions. So that they finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thus oppressed by the Popes, fled
again back to the Crown for Protection, which their Predecessors had
abandoned.</p>
            <p>From the days of <hi>Edward</hi> the 1st many Statutes were made

ordained, <hi>that these Oppressions should not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in any

effectual way laid down in the Act, to punish these Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions. The Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> was not so easily driven out of any thing, that either
encreased their Power or their Profits; Therefore by another Act in his

Profits, by which the Treasure of the Realm was carried out of it, and many
Clerks advanced in the Realm, were put out of their Benefices, by those

Provisions was made against Aliens, having Benefices without the Kings Licence,
and the King promised to abstain from granting them Licences: for this was
another Artifice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, to get the King of their side, by
accepting his Licence, which by this Act was restrained. This failing, they
betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to another course, which was to prevail with the Incumbents
that were presented in <hi>England</hi> according to Law, to take Provisions

had a mind to draw to themselves, and to have all Titles to Advousons tryed in

this effect, <hi>That the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>which had been so free at
all times, should be subjected to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the Laws
and Statutes of the Realm by him defeated and destroyed, at his Will. They also
found those things to be against the Kings Crown, and Regality, used and
approved in the time of his Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: Therefore all the Commons resolved to
live and dye with him and his Crown, and they required him by way of Iustice,
to Examine all the Lords, Spiritual and Temporal, what they thought of those
things, and whether they would be with the Crown to uphold the Regality of it?
To which all the Temporal Lords answered, they would be with the Crown. But the
Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Lords being asked, said, they would neither deny nor affirm that the
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of</hi> Rome, <hi>might, or might not, Excommunicate Bishops, or make
Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations of Prelates: But upon that Protestation,</hi> they said, <hi>that
if such things were done, they thought it was against the Crown, and said, they
would be with the King, as they were bound by their Leageance</hi>; whereupon
it was ordained, <hi>that if any did purchase Translations, Sentences of
Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, Bulls, or other Instruments from the Court of</hi> Rome,
<hi>against the King or his Crown, or whosoever brought them to</hi> England,
<hi>or did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or execute them, they were out of the Kings Protection,
and that they should forfeit their Goods and Chattels to the King, and their
Persons should be imprisoned.</hi> And because the Proceedings were to be upon
a writ, called from the most material words of it, <hi>Premunire facies,</hi>
this was called the <hi>Statute of Premunire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, had Treasonably Usurped the Crown,
all the Bishops (<hi>Carlisle</hi> only excepted) did assist him in it, and he
did very gratefully oblige them again in other things; yet he kept up the force
of the former Statutes. For the <hi>Cistercian</hi> Order hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing procured
Bulls, discharging them of paying Tithes, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to let their
Farms to any, but to possess them themselves,</p>

interrupted, either by the Pope, or the King. But at the same time, the King
pardoned all the former Transgressions against these Statutes. By those Pardons
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was more encouraged, than ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the Laws,
therefore there was a necessity of making another Law in the Reign of
<hi>Henry</hi> 5th, against <hi>Provisors, that the Incumbents Lawfully
Invested in their Livings, should not be molested by them, though they had the
Kings Pardon; and both Bulls and Licences were declared void and of no value,

            </p>
            <p>Our Kings took the best opportunity that ever could have been
found, to depress the Papal Power; for from the beginning of <hi>Richard</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>

and great Schism; and the Kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>doms
of <hi>Europe</hi> were divided in their Obedience: Some holding for those that
sate at <hi>Rome,</hi> and others for the Popes of <hi>Avignon: England</hi> in
oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to <hi>France,</hi> that chiefly supported the
<hi>Avignon</hi>-Popes, did adhere to the <hi>Roman</hi> Popes. The Papacy
being thus divided, the Popes were as much at the mercy of Kings for their
Protection, as Kings had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been at theirs; so that they durst not
Thunder as they were wont to do, otherwise this Kingdom had certainly been put
under Excommunications and Interdicts for these Statutes, as had been done
formerly upon less Provocations.</p>
            <p>But now that the Schism was healed, Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the
Fifth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reassume the Spirit of his Predecessors, and sent over
threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing messages to <hi>England,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Sixths Reign. None of our Books have taken any notice of this piece of our
Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: The Manuscript out of which I draw it,<note place="margin">

               </note> had been written near that time, and
contains many of the Letters, that passed between <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>England,</hi> upon this occasion.</p>
            <p>The first Letter is to <hi>Henry Chichely,</hi> then Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> who had been promoted to that See by the Pope, but had
made <pb n="110" facs="tcp:104314:74"/> no opposition to the Statute against Provisions in
the Fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth;<note place="margin">1530.</note> and
afterwards in the Eighth year of his Reign, when the Pope had granted a
Provision of the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>York,</hi>

to the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Chapter of <hi>York</hi> rejected it,
and pursuant to the former Statute, made a Canonical Election. <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fifth being then the greatest King in Christendome, the Pope durst not
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him: So the Law took place without any further contradiction, till the
Sixth year of his Sons Reign, that <hi>England</hi> was both under an Infant
King, and had fallen from its former greatness: Therefore the Pope who waited
for a good conjuncture, laid hold on this, and first expostulated severely with
the Arch-Bishop for his remisness, that he had not stood up more, for the Right
of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> that had bestowed on him
the Prima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of <hi>England</hi>;
and then says ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things against the Statute of Premunire, and exhorts him to
imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Example of his Predecessor St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, in asserting the Rights of the Church;
requiring him, under the pain of Excommunication, to declare at the next
Parliament to both Houses, the unlawfulness of that Statute, and that all were
under Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, who obeyed it. But to make sure work among the people,
he also commands him, to give orders under the same pains, that all the Clergy
of <hi>England</hi> should preach the same Doctrine to the people.<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 37.</note> This bears date the 5th day of
<hi>December</hi> 1426. and will be found in the Collection of Papers.</p>
            <p>But it seems the Pope was not satisfied with his Answer, for the
next Letter in that MSS. is yet more severe, and in it, his Legantine Power is
suspended. It has no date added to it, but the Paper that follows, bearing date
the 6th of <hi>April</hi> 1427. leads us pretty near the date of it. It
contains an Appeal of the Arch-Bishops, from the Popes Sentence, to the next
general Council; or if none met, to the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of God and Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>There is also another Letter, dated the 6th of <hi>May</hi>
directed to the Arch-Bishop, and makes mention of Letters written to the whole
Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie to the same purpose, Requiring him to use all his Endeavors, for
repealing the Statute, and chides him severely because he had said, <hi>that
the Popes zeal in this matter was only, that he might raise much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out
of</hi> England; which he resents as an high Injury, and Protests that he
designed only to maintain these Rights, that Christ himself had granted to his
See, which the Holy Fathers, the Councils, and the Catholick Church has always
acknowledged. If this does not look like Teaching <hi>ex Cathedra</hi> it is
left to the Readers Judgment.</p>
            <p>But the next Letter is of an higher strain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is directed to
the two Arch-Bishops only, and it seems, in despite to <hi>Chichely,</hi> the
Arch-Bishop of <hi>York</hi> is named before <hi>Canterbury.</hi> By it the
Pope annuls the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third and
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to do no Act in pursuance of
them: and declares, if they, or any other gave obedience to them, they were
<hi>ipso facto</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and not to be relaxed, unless at the point
of death, by any but the Pope. He charges them also to intimate that his
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitory Letter to the whole nation, and cause it to be affixed in the
se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, where there might be occasion for it. This is dated the 8th of
<hi>Decemb.</hi> the tenth year of his Popedom. Then follow Letters 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104314:74"/> from the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Arch-Bishop
of <hi>York,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1531.</note> the Bishops of <hi>London,
Duresm,</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> to the Pope; all to mitigate his
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure against the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in which they gave
him the highest testimony possible, bearing date the 10th and the 25th day of
<hi>Iuly.</hi> These the Arch-Bishop sent by an Express to <hi>Rome,</hi> and
wrote the humblest submission possible to the Pope; Protesting that he had
done, and would do all that was in his Power, for repealing these Statutes. One
thing in this Letter is remarkable, he says, <hi>he hears the Pope had
proceeded to a Sentence against him, which had never been done from the days of
St.</hi> Austin <hi>to that time: but he knew that only by report, for he had
not opened, much less read the Bulls, in which it was contained; being
commanded by the King, to bring them with the Seals en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and lay them up in
the Paper-Office, till the Parliament was brought together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two other Letters to the King. and one to the
Parliament,<note place="margin"> 
                  <p>And to the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p> 
                  <p>Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 38.</p>
               </note> for the Repeal of the
Statute. In those to the King, the Pope writes, that he had often pressed both
King and Parliament to it; and that the King had answered, that he could not
repeal it without the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. But he excepts to that, as a delaying the
business, and shews it is of it self unlawful, and that the King was under
Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as long as he kept it; therefore he expects that at the
furthest, in the next Parliament, it should be repealed.<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 39.</note> It bears date the 13th of
<hi>October,</hi> in the 10th year of his Popedom. In his Letter to the
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, he tells them, that no Man can be saved, who is for the
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of that Statute: Therefore he requires them, under pain of
Damnation to repeal it, and offers to secure them from any abuses, which might
have crept in formerly with these Provisions. This is dated the Third of
<hi>October, Decimo Pontificat.</hi> but I believe it is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the
Transcriber, and that its true date was the 13th of <hi>October.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament sate in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1427, being the 6th year
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th, during which on the 30th of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> accompanyed by the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>York,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>London,</hi> St. <hi>Davids, Ely,</hi> and
<hi>Norwich,</hi> and the Abbots of <hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi>
went from the House of Lords, to the place where the House of Commons
ordinarily sate, which was the Refectory of the Abbey of <hi>Westminster,</hi>
where the Arch-Bishop made a long Speech, in the form of a Sermon, upon that
Text; <hi>Render to Coesar the things that are Coesars, and to God, the things
that are Gods.</hi> He began with a Protestation, that he and his Brethren
intended not to say any thing, that might derogate from the King, the Crown, or
the people of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> Then he alledged many things, for the Popes
Power in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provisions, to prove it was of Divine Right, and admonished
and required them to give the Pope satisfaction in it, otherwise he laid out to
them with tears, what mischiefs might follow, if he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to censures;
which will appear more fully from the Instrument,<note place="margin"> 
                  <p>But to no purpose.</p> 
                  <p>Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 40.</p>
               </note> that will be found in
the Collection at the end. But it seems the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would do nothing for
all this, for no Act neither of Repeal nor Explanation was passed.</p>
            <p>Yet it appears the Pope was satisfied with the Arch-Bishops
carriage in this matter, for he soon after restored him to the Exercise of his
Legantine Power, as <hi>Godwin</hi> has it; only he by a mistake says, he was 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104314:75"/> made Legate, <hi>Anno</hi> 1428. whereas it was only a
Restitution after a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>Thus stood the Law of <hi>England</hi> in that matter, which was
neither Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed nor well Executed;<note place="margin">The Clergy excuse
  them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> for the Popes Usurpations still encreasing, those Statutes
lay dead among the Records, and several Cardinals had procured and executed a
Legantine Power, which was clearly contrary to them. And as Cardinal
<hi>Wolsey</hi> was already brought under the lash for it, so it was now made
use of; partly to give the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of what they
were to expect from the King, if they went on to use him ill; and partly to
proceed severely against all those of the Clergy, who adhared obstinately to
the Interests of that Court; and to make the rest compound the matter, both by
a full Submission and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Subsidy. It was in vain to pretend, it
was a publick and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Error, and that the King had not only connived at
the Cardinals Proceedings, but had made him all that while his chief Minister:
That therefore they were excusable in submitting to an Authority to which the
King gave so great encouragement, and that if they had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they had
been unavoidably ruined. For to all this it was answered, that the Laws were
still in force, and that their Ignorance could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them, since they
ought to have known the Law; yet since the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it was so publick,
though the Court proceeded to a Sentence, That they were all out of the Kings
protection, and were liable to the pains in the Statutes;<note place="margin">Yet
  they Compound.</note> the King was willing, upon a reasonable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and
a full Submission, to Pardon them.</p>
            <p>So in the Convocation of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a Petition was
brought in to be offered to the King. In the Kings Title, he was called,
<hi>the Protector and Supreme Head of the Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And
  acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the King Supreme Head of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Lord

               </note> 
               <hi>and
Clergy of</hi> England. To this some oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition was made, and it was put off
to another day; but by the Interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and others of
the Kings Council, who came to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and used arguments to perswade
them to it, they were prevailed with to pass it with that Title, at least none
speaking against it: For when <hi>Warham</hi> Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> said, <hi>That silence was to be taken for consent,</hi>
They cried out, <hi>they were then all silent</hi>: Yet it was moved by some to
add these words to the Title, <hi>in so far as is lawful by the Law of
Christ.</hi> But <hi>Parker</hi> says, The King disliked that Clause, since it
left his Power still disputable;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiquit. Britanniae in
  vita</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> therefore it was cast out, and the Petition passed
simply, as it was first brought in. Yet in that he was certainly misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
for when the Convocation of the Province of <hi>York</hi> demurred about the
same Petition, and sent their reasons to the King, why they could not
acknowledge him <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> which (as appears by the Kings answer to
them,<note place="margin">Printed in the <hi>Cabala.</hi>
               </note>) were chiefly
founded on this, that the term <hi>Head</hi> was improper, and did not agree to
any under Christ; the King wrote a long and sharp answer to them, and showed
them, that words were not always to be understood in their strict sense, but
according to the common acceptation. And among other things he showed what an
Explanation was made in the Convocation of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> That it was
<hi>in so far as was agreeable to the Law of Christ</hi>; by which it appears,
that at that time the King was satisfied to have it pass any way, and so it was
agreed to by nine Bishops (the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> being one) and 52
Abbots and Priors, and the major part of the lower House of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the
Province of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Of which number it is very probable 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104314:75"/> 
               <hi>Reginald Pool</hi> was, for in his Book to the King,
he says, he was then in <hi>England,</hi> and adds, that the King would not
accept of the sum the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy offered, unless they acknowledged him <hi>Supreme
Head</hi>: he being then Dean of <hi>Exceter,</hi> was of the lower House of
Convocation; and it is not likely the King would have continued the Pensions,
and other Church-Preferments he had, if he had refused to Signe that Petition
and Submission. By it they prayed the King to accept 100000 <hi>l.</hi> in lieu
of all punishments which they had incurred, by going against the Statutes of
<hi>Provisors,</hi> and did promise for the future, neither to make, nor
exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any Constitution without the Kings Licence; upon which he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them a general Pardon: and the Convocation of the Province of <hi>York</hi>
offering 18840 <hi>l.</hi> with another Submission of the same nature
afterwards, though that met with more opposition, they were also Pardoned.</p>
            <p>When the King's Pardon for the Clergy was brought in to the House
of Commons, they were much troubled to find themselves not included within it;
for by the Statutes of <hi>Provisors,</hi> many of them were also li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and
they apprehended,<note place="margin"> 
                  <p>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons desire to be included in the King's Pardon.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
               </note> that either they might be
brought in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or at least it might be made use of to draw a Subsidy from
them: so they sent their Speaker with some of their Members, to represent to
the King, the great grief of his Commons to find themselves out of his favour,
which they concluded from the Pardon of the pains of <hi>Premunire</hi> to his
Spiritual Subjects, in which they were not included; and therefore pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the
King that they might be comprehended within it. But the King answered them,
That they must not restrain his Mercy, nor yet force it; it was free to him
either to execute, or mitigate the Severity of the Law: That he might well
grant his Pardon by his Great-Seal without their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but he would be well
advised before he pardoned them, because he would not seem to be compelled to
it. So they went away, and the House was in some trouble: many blamed
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> who was growing in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for this rough answer; yet the
King's Pardon was passed.</p>
            <p>But his other concerns made him judge it very unfit to send away
his Parliament discontented,<note place="margin">Which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

easie to them as to ask no Subsidy, he had no mind to offend them; and
therefore when the thing was over, and they out of hopes of it, he of his own
accord sent another Pardon to all his Temporal Subjects, of their Transgressons
of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of <hi>Provisors</hi> and <hi>Premunire</hi>; which they
received with great joy, and acknowledged there was a just Temperature of

            <p>During this Session of Parliament, an unheard-of Crime was
commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one <hi>Richard Rouse</hi> a Cook, who on the 16th of

of it; and some poor People that were Charitably fed with the remainder of it,
were also infected, one woman dying. The Person was Apprehended,<note place="margin">22. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Act. 16.</note> and by Act of
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Poisoning was declared <hi>Treason,</hi> and <hi>Rouse</hi> was

               </note> And the Sentence was Executed in <hi>Smithfield</hi> soon
after.</p>
            <p>Of this I take Notice, the rather because of <hi>Sander</hi>'s
Malice, who says, <pb n="114" facs="tcp:104314:76"/> this <hi>Rouse</hi> was set on by
<hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi> to make away the Bishop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> of which
there is nothing on Record, nor does any Writer of that time so much as
insinuate it. But persons that are set on
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o commit such Crimes, are usually,
either conveighed out of the way, or secretly dispatched, that they may not be
brought to an open Trial. And it is not to be imagined, That a man that was
employed by them that might have preferred him, and found himself given up and
adjudged to such a death, would not have published their names who set him on,
to have lessened his own Guilt, by casting the load upon them that had both
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and deserted him. But this must pass among the many other vile
Calumnies, of which <hi>Sanders</hi> has been the inventer, or publisher, and
for which he had already answered to his Judg.</p>
            <p>When the Session of Parliament was over, the King continued to ply
the Queen with all the applications he could think of,<note place="margin">Lord
  <hi>Herbert.</hi>
               </note> to depart from her Appeal. He grew very Melancholy,
and used no sort of Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">The King leaves the
  Queen.</note> but was observed to be very pensive. Yet nothing could prevail
with the Queen. She answered the Lords of the Council, when they pressed her
much to it, <hi>That she prayed God to send the King a quiet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but
that she was his lawful Wife, and would abide by it, till the Court of</hi>
Rome <hi>declared the contrary.</hi> Upon which the King forbore to see her, or
to receive any Tokens from her, and sent her word, to choose where she had a
mind to live, in any of his Mannours. She answered, that to which place soever
she were removed, <hi>nothing could remove her from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Wife.</hi> Upon
this answer the King left her at <hi>Windsor,</hi> the 14th of <hi>Iuly,</hi>
and never saw her more. She removed first to <hi>Moor,</hi> then to
<hi>Easthamstead,</hi> and at last to <hi>Ampthill,</hi> where she stayed
longer.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A disorder among the Clergy of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
  about the Subsidy. <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </note>The Clergy went now about the raising
of the 100000 <hi>l.</hi> which they were to pay in five years; and to make it
easier to themselves, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates had a great mind to draw in the Inferiour
Clergy to bear a part of the burden. The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> called a
meeting of some Priests a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>London,</hi> on the 1st. of
<hi>September,</hi> to the Chapter-House at St. <hi>Pauls</hi>: He designed to
have had at first only a small number, among whom he hoped it would easily
pass, and that being done by a few, others would more willingly follow. But the
matter was not so secretly carried, but that all the Clergy about the City
hearing of it, went thither. They were not a little encouraged by many of the
Laity, who thought it no unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant diversion to see the Clergy fall out among
themselves. So when they came to the Chapter-House on the day appointed, the
Bishop's Officers would only admit some few to enter, but the rest forced the
door and rushed in, and the Bishop's Servants were beaten and ill used. But the
Bishop seeing the tumult was such, that it could not be easily quieted, told
them all, <hi>That as the State of men in this life was frail, so the Clergy
through frailty and want of wisdom, had misdemeaned themselves towards the
King, and had fallen in a Premunire, for which the King of his great Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
was pleased to Pardon them, and to accept of a little, in stead of the whole of
their Benefices, which by the Law had fallen into his hand: Therefore he
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired they would patiently bear their share in this burden.</hi> But they
answered, They had never medled with any of the Cardinals Faculties, and so had
not fallen in the <hi>P remunire</hi>; and that their Livings were so small,
that they could hardly subsist by them. Therefore since the Bishops and Abbots
were only Guilty, and had good Preferments, they only ought 
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104314:76"/> to be punished, and pay the Tax; but that for themselves
they needed not the Kings Pardon, and so would pay nothing for it. Upon which
the Bishop's Officers threatned them, but they on the other hand (being
encouraged by some Lay-men that came along with them) persisted in their denyal
to pay any thing; so that from high words the matter came to blows, and several
of the Bishop's Servants were ill handled by them. But he to prevent a further
Tumult, apprehending it might end upon himself, gave them good words, and
dismissed the meeting with his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and promised that nothing should be
brought in Question that was then done. Yet he was not so good as his word, for
he complained of it to the Lord Chancellor, who was always a great Favourer of
the Clergy; by whose order fifteen Priests and five Lay-men were committed to
seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prisons; but whether the Inferiour Clergy pay'd their proportion of
the Tax or not, I have not been able to discover.</p>
            <p>This year the State of Affairs beyond-Sea, changed very
considerably.<note place="margin">The Pope falls off to the <hi>French</hi>
  Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> The Pope expected not only to recover <hi>Florence</hi> to his
Family by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors means, but also to wrest <hi>Modena</hi> and
<hi>Reggio</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> to which he pretended, as
being Fiefs of the Papacy; and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror having engaged by the former
Treatyto restore them to him. But now that the Popes pretensions were appointed
to be examined by some Judges delegated by the Emperor, they determined against
the Pope, for the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi>: which so disgusted the Pope, that
he fell totally from the Emperor, and did unite with the King of
<hi>France,</hi> a Match being also projected between the Duke of
<hi>Orleance</hi> (afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d) and his Neece
<hi>Catharine de Medici</hi>; which did work much on the Popes ambition, to
have his Family Allied to so mighty a Monarch. So that now he became wholly
<hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King was also on account of this
Marriage,<note place="margin">A Match pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Pope's Neece and
  the Duke of <hi>Orleance.</hi>
               </note> to resigne all the pretensions he had to
any Territory in <hi>Italy</hi> to his younger Son; which as it would give
less-Umbrage to the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked rather to have
a King's younger Son among them, than either the Emperor or the <hi>French</hi>
King; so the Pope was wonderfully pleased to raise another great Prince in
<hi>Italy</hi> out of his own Family. On these grounds was the Match at this
time designed, which afterwards took effect; but with this difference, that by
the <hi>Dolphin's</hi> death, the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> became King of
<hi>France,</hi> and his Queen made the greatest Figure that any Queen of
<hi>France</hi> had done for many Ages.</p>
            <p>This change in the Popes mind might have produced another in the
Kings Affairs, if he had not already gone so far, that he was less in fear of
the Pope than formerly. He found the Credit of his Clergy was so low, that to
preserve themselves from the contempt and fury of the people, they were forced
to depend wholly on the Crown. For <hi>Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme</hi> was then making a
great progress in <hi>England,</hi> of which I shall say nothing here, being
resolved at the end of this Book to give an account of the whole Course of it
in those years that fall within this time. But what by the means of the new
Preachers, what by the scandals cast on the Clergy, they were all at the Kings
Mercy; so he did not fear much from them, especially in the Southern parts,
which were the richest and best peopled. Therefore the King went on resolutely.
The Pope on the other hand was in great perplexity, he saw <hi>England</hi>
ready to be lost, and knew not what to do to rescue or preserve it. If he gave
way to <pb n="116" facs="tcp:104314:77"/> what was lately done in the business of the
<hi>Premunire,</hi> he must thereby lose the greatest advantages he drew from
that Nation; and it was not likely that after the King had gone so far, he
would undo what was done.</p>
            <p>The Emperor was more remiss in prosecuting the Queens Appeal at
<hi>Rome,</hi> for at that time the <hi>Turk</hi> with a most numerous and
powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was making an impression on <hi>Hungary,</hi>

the great scandal of the <hi>most Christian King</hi> was imputed to his

taken up with this. Therefore as he gave the Protestant Princes of
<hi>Germany</hi> some present satisfaction in Religion and other matters; so he
sent over to <hi>England,</hi> and desired the Kings assistance against that
vast Army of 300000 men that was falling in upon Christendom. To this the King
made a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral answer, that gave some hopes of assisting him. But at the same
time the Protestant Princes, resolving to draw some advantage from that
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of Affairs, and being courted by the <hi>French</hi> King, entred
into a League with him, for the defence of the Rights of the Empire. And to
make this firmer, the King was invited by the <hi>French</hi> King to joyn in
it; to which he consented, and sent over to <hi>France</hi> a sum of Money to
be employed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Empire. And this provoked the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to renew his endeavours in the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> for prosecuting the Queens Appeal.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King encouraged the King to go on with his
Divorce, that he might totally Alienate him from the Emperor. The
<hi>French</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters also add another Consideration, which seems unworthy
of so great a King, that he himself being at that time so publick a Courtier of
Ladies, was not ill pleased to set forward a thing of that nature. 
<q>But though Princes allow themselves their pleasures, yet they
  seldom Govern their Affairs by such Maximes.</q>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">1532.</note>In the beginning of the next year a
new Session of Parliament was held, in which the House of Commons went on to
complain of many other grievances they lay under from the Clergy,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the Ecclesiastical Courts.</note>
which they put in a writing, and Presented it to the King. In it they
complained of the proceedings in the Spiritual Courts, and especially their
calling men before them, <hi>ex officio,</hi> and laying Articles to their
charge, without any Accuser; and then admitting no Purgation, but causing the
Party Accused, either to abjure,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </note> or to
be burnt; which they found very grievous and intollerable. This was occasioned
by some violent proceeding against some reputed Hereticks, of which an account
shall be given afterwards. But those complaints were stifled, and great
misunderstandings arose between the King and the House of Commons upon this
following occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">But reject a Bill about Wards.</note>There was
a common practice in <hi>England</hi> of mens making such Setle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their
Estates by their Last Wills, or other Deeds, that the King and some great Lords
were thereby defrauded of the advantages they made by <hi>Wards,
Marriages,</hi> and <hi>Primer Season.</hi> For regulating which, a Bill was
brought in to the House of Peers, and assented to there; but when it was sent
down to the House of Commons, it was rejected by them, and they would neither
pass the Bill, nor any other Qualification of that Abuse, This gave the King
great offence, and the House when they addressed to him about the proceedings
of the Clergy,<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Petition that they may be
  Dissolved.</note> also prayed, <hi>That he would consider what Cost, Charge,
and Pains they had been at since the beginning of the Parliament, and that it
would please his Grace of his Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="117" facs="tcp:104314:77"/> Benignity to
Dissolve his Court of Parliament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1532.</note> 
               <hi>and
that his Subjects might return into their Countries.</hi> To which the King
answered, 
<q>That for their complaints of the Clergy, he must hear them also
  before he could give Judgment, since in Justice he ought to hear both Parties;
  but that their desiring the Redress of such Abuses, was contrary to the other
  part of their Petition; for if the Parliament were Dissolved,<note place="margin">The King's Answer.</note> how could those things they complained
  of be amended? And as they complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their long attendance, so the King
  had stayed as long, as they had done, and yet he had still patience, and so
  they must have, otherwise their grievances would be without Redress. But he did
  expostulate severely upon their rejecting the Bill about Deeds in prejudice of
  the Rights of the Crown. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aid,
  he had offered them a great mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what by the rigour of the Law he
  might pretend to; and if they would not accept of it, he would try the outmost
  severity that the Law allowed, and would not offer them such a favour
  again.</q> Yet all this did not prevail, for the Act was rejected, and their
complaint against the Clergy was also laid aside, and the Parliament was
Prorogued till <hi>April</hi> next.</p>
            <p>In this Parliament the Foundation of the Breach that afterwards
followed with <hi>Rome,</hi> was laid, by an Act for restraining the payment of
<hi>Annates</hi> to that Court, which since it is not Printed with the other
Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, shall be found in the end of this Volume: The substance of it is as
follows.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>That great Sums of Money had been conveyed out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
  under the Title of <hi>Annates</hi> or first Fruits to the Court of
  <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin"> 
                     <p>An Act against <hi>Annates.</hi>
                     </p> 
                     <p>Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 41.</p>
                  </note> which they extorted
  by restraint of Bulls and other writs; that it happened often by the frequent
  deaths of Arch-Bishops, and Bishops, to turn to the utter undoing of their
  Friends, who had advanced those Sums for them. These <hi>Annates</hi> were
  founded on no Law, for they had no other way of obliging the Incumbents of Sees
  to pay them, but by restraining their Bulls. The Parliament therefore
  considering that these were first begun to be payed, to defend Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
  against Infidels, but were now turned to a duty claimed by that Court against
  all Right and Conscience, and that vast Sums were carryed away upon that
  account, which from the Second year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th to that
  present time amounted to 800000 Ducats, besides many other heavy Exactions of
  that Court, did declare that the King was bound by his Duty to Almighty God, as
  a good Christian Prince to hinder these oppressions. And that the rather,
  because many of the Prelates were then very Aged, and like to die in a short
  time, whereby vast Sums of Money should be carryed out of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> to
  the great Impoverishing of the Kingdom. And therefore all payments of first
  Fruits to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> were put down, and for ever restrained,
  under the pains of the forfeiture of the Lands, Goods, and Chattels of him that
  should pay them any more, together with the Profits of his See, during the time
  that he was vested with it. And in case Bulls were restrained in the Court of
  <hi>Rome,</hi> any person presented to a Bishoprick, should be notwithstanding
  Consecrated by the Arch-Bishop of the Province; or if he were presented to an
  Arch-Bishoprick, by any two Bishops in the Kingdom, whom the King should
  appoint for that end; and that being so Consecrated, <pb n="118" facs="tcp:104314:78"/> they
  should be Invested, and enjoy all the Rights of their Sees in full and ample
  manner: yet that the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> might have no just cause
  of Complaint, the persons presented to Bishopricks are allowed to pay them 5
  <hi>lib.</hi> for the Hundred, of the clear Profits and Revenues of their
  several Sees. But the Parliament not willing to go to extremities, Remitted the
  final ordering of that Act to the King, that if the Pope would either
  charitably and reasonably put down the payment of <hi>Annates,</hi> or so
  moderate them, that they might be a tolerable burden, the King might at any
  time before <hi>Easter</hi> 1533. or before the next Session of Parliament,
  declare by his Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents whether the premises or any part of them should
  be observed or not, which should give them the full force and Authority of a
  Law. And that if upon this Act the Pope should vex the King, or any of his
  Subjects by E xommunications or other Censures, these not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the King
  should cause the Sacraments, and other Rites of the Church to be administred,
  and that none of these Censures might be published or Executed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Bill began in the House of Lords, from them it was sent to
the Commons, and being agreed to by them, received the Royal Assent, but had
not that final Confirmation mentioned in the Act before the 9th of
<hi>Iuly</hi> 1533. and then by Letters Patents (in which the Act is at length
recited) it was confirmed.<note place="margin">Parl. Rolls.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But now I come to open the final Conclusion of the Kings Suit at
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pope writes to the King about the Queens
  Appeal.</note> 
               <q>On the 25th of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the Pope wrote to the King, that
  he heard reports, which he very unwillingly believed, that he had put away his
  Queen, and kept one <hi>Anne</hi> about him as his Wife; which as it gave much
  Scandal, so it was an high Contempt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick See, to do such a thing
  while his Suit was still depending, notwithstanding a Prohibition to the
  contrary. Therefore the Pope remembring his former merits, which were now like
  to be clouded with his present Carriage, did exhort him to take home his Queen,
  and to put <hi>Anne</hi> away; and not to continue to provoke the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and
  his Brother by so high an Indignity, nor to break the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral peace of

               </q> What answer the King made to this I do not find, but instead

                  <note place="margin">A Dispatch of the King to the Pope.</note>The
  Pope had writ to the King, in order to the clearing all his scruples, and to
  give him quiet in his Conscience; of which the King takes notice, and is sorry
  that both the Pope and himself were so deceived in that matter; the Pope by
  trusting to the judgments of others, and writing whatever they suggested; and
  the King by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending so much on the Pope, and in vain expecting remedy from 
  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:104314:78"/> him so long. He imputes the mistakes that were in the
  Popes Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (which he says had things in them contrary both to Gods Law and
  Mans Law,) to the Ignorance and rashness of his Councellors: for which himself
  was much to be blamed, since he rested on their advice, and that he had not
  carryed himself as became Christs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, but had dealt both unconstantly and
  deceitfully: for when the Kings cause was first opened to him, and all things
  that Related to it were explained; he had Granted a Commission, with a promise
  not to recall it, but to confirm the Sentence which the Legates should give:
  and a Decretal was sent over defining the cause. If these were justly granted,
  it was unjustice to revoke them, but if they were justly revoked, it was unjust
  to grant them. So he presses the Pope, that either he could grant these things,
  or he could not. If he could do it, where was the Faith which became a Friend,
  much more a Pope since he had broke these promises: But if he said he could not
  do them, had he not then just cause to distrust all that came from him, when at
  one time he condemned what he had allowed at another. So that the King saw
  clearly he did not Consider the ease of his Conscience, but other worldly
  respects; that had put him on Consulting so many Learned men, whose judgments
  differed much from those few that were about the Pope, who thought the
  Prohibition of such Marriages was onely positive, and might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed with
  by the Pope: whereas all other Learned men thought the Law was Moral and
  indispensable. He perceived the Apostolick See was destitute of that Learning,
  by which it should be directed: and the Pope had oft professed his own
  Ignorance, and that he spake by other mens mouths; but many Universities in
  <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> had declared the Marriage
  unlawful, and the Dispensation null. None honoured the Apostolick See more than
  he had done, and therefore he was sorry to write such things if he could have
  been silent. If he should obey the Popes Letters, he would offend God and his
  own Conscience, and give scandal to those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned his Marriage: he did
  not willingly dissent from him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a very urgent cause, that he might not
  seem to despise the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick See; therefore he desired the Pope would
  forgive the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that he used, since it was the Truth that drew it from
  him. And he added, that he intended not to Impugn the Popes Authority fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
  except he compelled him; and what he did was only to bring it within its first
  and Ancient Limits, to which it was better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, than to let it always
  run on headlong and do amiss; therefore he desired the Pope would Conform
  himself to the opinions of so many Learned men, and do his Duty and Office. The

            <p>The Pope seeing his Authority was declining in <hi>England,</hi>

in <hi>March,</hi> where they found great heats in the Consistory about the
Kings business. The Imperialists pressed the Pope to proceed, but all the wise
and indifferent Cardinals were of another mind. And when they understood what
an Act was passed about <hi>Annates</hi>; they saw clearly, that the Parliament
was resolved to adhere to the King in every thing he intended to do against
their Interests. The Pope expostulated with the Ambassadors about it, but they
told him the Act was still in the Kings Power; and except he provoked him, he
did not intend to put it in execution. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors finding the Cardinal of
<hi>Ravenna</hi> of so great reputation, both for Learning and Vertue, that in
all matters of that kind his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was heard as an Oracle, and gave Law to
the whole Consistory; they resolved to gain him by all means possible. And
Doctor <hi>Bennet</hi> made a secret address to him, and offered him what
Bishoprick either in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England</hi> he would desire, if he
would bring the Kings matter to a good issue. He was at first very shie, at
length he said he had been oft deceived by many Princes, who had made him great
Promises, but when their business was ended, never thought of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them;
therefore he would be sure: and so drave a Bargain, and got under Doctor
<hi>Bennets</hi> hand a promise, (of which a Copy being sent to the King,
written by <hi>Bennet</hi> himself, will be found at the end of this Volume;)
Bearing, that he having Powers from the King for that effect,<note place="margin">

               </note> dated the 29th of

vacant, upon his resigning the other, he should be provided with the Bishoprick
of <hi>Ely</hi>; dated at <hi>Rome</hi> the 7th of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1532.
This I set down as one of the most Considerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that could be used
to satisfie the Cardinals Conscience about the justice of the Kings cause. This
Cardinal was the fittest to work secretly for the King, for he had appeared
visible against him. I find also by other Letters, that both the Cardinals of
<hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ona</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>
(afterwards Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the 3d) were prevailed with, by arguments of
the same nature, though I cannot find cut what the Bargains were.
<hi>Providellus,</hi> that was accounted the greatest Canonist in
<hi>Italy,</hi> was brought from <hi>Bononia,</hi> and entertained by the
Ambassadors, to give Counsel in the Kings cause, and to plead his Excuse from
appearing at <hi>Rome.</hi> The plea was summed up in 28 Articles, which were
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Pope; and he admitted them to be examined in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory,
appointing three of them to be opened at a Session. But the Imperialists
opposed that, and after fifteen of them had been heard, procured a new order
that they should be heard in a Congregation of Cardinals before the Pope;<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 44.</note> pretending that a Consistory
sitting <pb n="121" facs="tcp:104314:79"/> but once a week, and having a great deal of other
Business, it would be long before the matter could be brought to any issue. So
<hi>Karne</hi> was served with a new order to appear in the Congregation the
3d. of <hi>April</hi> with this Certification, That if he appeared not they
would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Upon which he protested, that he would adhere to the former
Order: yet being warned the second time, he went first and protested against
it, which he got entered in the Datary. This being considered in the
Congregation, they renewed the Order ofhearing it in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory on the
10th. of <hi>April,</hi> and then <hi>Providellus</hi> opened three
Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Two of them related to <hi>Karne</hi>'s Powers, the third was
concerning the Safety of the place to both parties. But the Imperialists and
the Queens Council being dissatisfied with this Order would not appear. Upon
which <hi>Karne</hi> complained of their Contumacy, and said, By that it was
visible they were distrustful of their Cause. On the 14th. of <hi>April</hi> a
new intimation was made to <hi>Karne</hi> to appear on the 17th. with his
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates to open all the rest of the Conclusions, but he according to the
first Order would onely plead to three of them, and selected the 19, 20,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 45.</note> and 21; (what these related to
I find not.) Upon which <hi>Providellus</hi> pleaded and answered the
Objections that did seem to militate against them, but neither would the
Imperiallists appear that Session.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Iune</hi> news were brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> which gave
the Pope great offence: A Priest had preached for the Popes Authority in
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and was for that cast into prison. And another Priest being
put in prison by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> upon suspition of
Heresie, had appealed to the King as the Supreme Lord: upon which he was taken
out of the Archbishops hands, and being examined in the Kings Courts was set at
liberty. This the Pope resented much, but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors said, all such
things might have been prevented, if the King had got Justice at the Popes
hands.</p>
            <p>The King also at this time desired a Bull for a Commission to
erect six new Bishopricks,<note place="margin">A Bull for erecting new
  Bishopricks.</note> to be endowed by Monasteries that were to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
This was expedited and sent away at this time: And the old Cardinal of
<hi>Ravenna</hi> was so jealous, that the Embassadors were forced to promise
him the Bishoprick of <hi>Chester,</hi> (one of the new Bishopricks) with which
he was well satisfied, having seen by a particular state of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment that
was designed for it, what advantage it would yield him. But he had declared
himself so openly before against the Reasons for the Excuse, that he could not
serve the King in that matter, but in the main Cause he undertook to do great
service, and so did the Cardinals <hi>De Monte</hi> and <hi>Ancona.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the 27th. of <hi>Iune</hi> the Debate was brought to a
Conclusion about the Plea Excusatory; and when it was expected, that the Pope
should have given sentence against the Articles, he admitted them all <hi>Si
&amp; prout de jure.</hi> Upon which the Imperiallists made great Complaints:
The Cardinals grew weary of the length of the Debate, since it took up all
their time; but it was told them, the matter was of great importance, and it
had been better for them not to have proceeded so precipitately at first, which
had now brought them into this trouble, and that the King had been at much
pains and trouble on their account; therefore it was unreasonable for them to
complain, who were put to no other trouble, but to sit in their Chairs two or
three hours in a week to hear the Kings <pb n="122" facs="tcp:104314:80"/> Defences. The
Imperiallists had also occasioned the Delays, though they complained of them;
by their Cavils, and Allegations ofLaws and Decisions that never were made, by
which much time was spent. But it was objected, That the Kings Excuse for not
coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was too remote from his Kingdom, and not
safe, was of no force, since the place was safe to his Proxy. And the Cardinal
of <hi>Ravenna</hi> pressed the Embassadors much to move the King, instead of
the Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satory Process to send a Proxy, for examining and discussing the
Merits of the Cause, in which it would be much easier to advance the Kings
matter; and that he having appeared against the King in this Process, would be
the less suspected in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin"> 
                  <p>The Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires the King would submit to him.</p> 
                  <p>Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 46.</p>
               </note>The business being
further considered in three Sessions of the Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it was resolved, that
since the Vacation was coming on, they would neither allow of, nor reject the
Kings Excusatory Plea; but the Pope and College of Cardinals would write to the
King, intreating him to send a Proxy for judging the Cause against the Winter.
And with this <hi>Bonner</hi> was sent over, with Instructions from the
Cardinals that were gained to the King, to represent to him that his Excusatory
Plea could not be admitted; for since the Debate was to be, whether the Pope
could grant the Dispensation or not, it could not be committed to Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, but
must be judged by the Pope and the Consistory. He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so ordered to assure
the King, that the Pope did now lean so much to the <hi>French</hi> Faction,
that he needed not fear to refer the matter to him.</p>
            <p>But while these things were in debate at <hi>Rome,</hi> there was
another Session of Parliament in <hi>April</hi>;<note place="margin">A Session of
  Parl.</note> and then the King sent for the Speaker of the House of Commons,
and gave him the Answer which the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy had drawn to the Addresses they made
in the former Session about their Courts. The King himself seemed not at all
pleased with it, but what the House did in it does not appear, further than
that they were no way satisfied with it. But there happened another thing that
offended the King much: One <hi>Temse</hi> of the House of Commons moved, that
they should address to the King to bring the Queen back to the Court,<note place="margin">One moves for bringing the Queen to Court.</note> and ran out upon
the Inconveniences that were like to follow if the Queen were put away,
particularly the ill consequence of the Illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Princess. Upon
this the King took occasion (when he gave them the Clergies Answer) to tell
them,<note place="margin">At which the King is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> that he wondered
at that motion made in their House, for the matter was not to be determined
there. It touched his Soul; he wished his Marriage were good, but the Doctors
and Learned men had determined it to be null and detestable; and therefore he
was obliged in Conscience to abstain from her, which he assured them flowed
from no Lust nor foolish Appetite. He was then 41 years old and at that Age
those Heats abate. But except in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Portugal</hi> it had not
been heard of, that a man married two Sisters; and that he never heard, that
any Christian man before himself had married his Brothers Wife: Therefore he
assured them his Conscience was troubled, which he desired them to report to
the House. In this Session the Lord Chancellour came down to the Commons, with
many of the Nobility about him, and told them the King had considered the
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which were uninhabited
on the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> side, but well peopled on the <hi>Scottish</hi>; and
that laid <hi>England</hi> open <pb n="123" facs="tcp:104314:80"/> to the Incursion of the
<hi>Scots</hi>; therefore the King intended to build Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses there, for
planting the <hi>English</hi> side. This the Lords liked very well, and thought
it convenient to give the King some Aids for the Charges of so necessary a
Work, and therefore desired the Commons to consult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Upon which the
House voted a Subsidy of a Fifteenth:<note place="margin">A Subsidy is
  voted.</note> But before the Bill could be finished the Plague broke out in
<hi>London,</hi> and the Parliament was prorogued till <hi>February</hi>
following. On the 11th of <hi>May</hi> (three days before the Prorogation) the
King sent for the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the House of Commons, and told him,<note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Oaths which the Clergy swore to be
  consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Commons.</note> 
               <q>That he found upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that all the Prelats, whom he had
  looked on as wholly his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, were but half-Subjects; for at their
  Consecration they swore an Oath quite contrary to the Oath they swore to the
  Crown; so that it seemed they were the Popes Subjects rather than his. Which he
  referred to their care, that such order might be taken in it, that the King
  might not be deluded.</q> Upon which the two Oaths that the Clergy swore to the
King and the Pope, were read in the House of Commons, but the Consequence of
them will be better understood by setting them down.</p>

off all the Illegal Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which the Popes exercised in
<hi>England,</hi> and therefore went cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully along with the Sute of
<hi>Praemunire</hi>; yet when he saw a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tal Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture like to follow, he excused himself, and retired from
Business with a Greatness of Mind, that was equal to what the ancient
Philosophers pretended in such cases. He also disliked <hi>Anne Boleyne,</hi>
and was prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by her Father, who studied to fasten some Criminal
Imputations on him about the discharge of his Imployment; but his Integrity had
been such, that nothing could be found to blemish his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>In <hi>September</hi> following the King created <hi>Anne
Boleyne</hi> Marchioness of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> to bring her by degrees up to
the Heighth for which he had designed her.<note place="margin">An Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiw with
  the <hi>French</hi> King.</note> And in <hi>October</hi> he passed the Seas,
and had an Enterview with the <hi>French</hi> King; where all the most obliging
Complements that were possible passed on both sides with great Magnificence,
and a firm Union was concerted about all their Affairs. They published a League
that they made to raise a mighty Army next year against the <hi>Turk</hi>; but
this was not much considered, it being generally believed that the
<hi>French</hi> King and the <hi>Turk</hi> were in a good Correspondence. As
for the matter of the Kings Divorce, <hi>Francis</hi> encouraged him to go on
in it, and in his intended Marriage with <hi>Anne Boleyne,</hi> promising if it
were question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="125" facs="tcp:104314:81"/> to assist him in it: And as for his
appearance at <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he could not go thither in
Person, so it was not fit to trust the secrets of his Conscience to a Proxie.
The <hi>French</hi> King seemed also resolved to stop the payments of Annates
and other Exactions of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and said he would send an
Ambassador to the Pope, to ask Redress of these, and to protest, that if it
were not granted, they would seek other remedies by Provincial Councils: And
since there was an interview de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed between the Pope and the Emperor at
<hi>Bononia</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King was to send two
Cardinalsthither to procure Judges for end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the business in
<hi>England.</hi> There was also an interview proposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Pope and
the <hi>French</hi> King, at <hi>Nice</hi> or <hi>Avignon.</hi> To this the
King of <hi>England</hi> had some Inclinations to go for ending all
differences, if the Pope were well disposed to it.</p>
            <p>Upon this Sir <hi>Thomas Eliot</hi> was sent to <hi>Rome</hi> with
answer to a message the Pope had sent to the King,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eliot</hi> sent to <hi>Rome</hi> with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.
  <hi>Cott.</hi> Lib. <hi>Vil.</hi> B. 13.</note> from whose Instructions both
the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the message and of the answer may be gathered. 
<q>The Pope had offered to the King, that if he would name any
  indifferent place out of his own Kingdom, he would send a Legate and two
  Auditors of the <hi>Rota</hi> thither, to form the Process, reserving only the
  Sentence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The Pope also proposed a Truce of three or four years,
  and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised that in that time he would call a general Council. For this
  mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage the King sent the Pope thanks, but for the Peace he could receive no
  propositions about it without the concurrence of the <hi>French</hi> King; and
  though he did not doubt the justice of a general Council, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the
  state of the Emperor's Affairs at that time, with the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> he
  did not think it was then seasonable to call one. That as for sending a Proxy
  to <hi>Rome,</hi> if he were a private Person he could do it, but it was a part
  of the Prerogative of his Crown, and of the Priviledges of his Subjects, That
  all Matrimonial Causes should be originally judged within his Kingdom by the
  <hi>English</hi> Church, which was conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the general Councils and
  Customs of the ancient Church, whereunto he hoped the Pope would have regard:
  And that for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Royal Authority, to which he was bound by Oath, he
  could not without the consent of the Realm, submit himself to a Forreign
  Jurisdiction; hoping the Pope would not desire any violation of the Immunities
  of the Realm, or to bring these into publick Contention, which had been
  hitherto enjoyed without intrusion or molestation. The Pope had confessed that
  without an urgent cause, the Dispensation could not be granted. This the King
  laid hold on, and ordered his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador to show him that there was no War nor
  appearance of any between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> when it was
  granted. To verifie that, he sent an attested Copy of the Treaty between his
  Father and the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> at that time: By the words of which it
  appeared that it was then taken for granted, that Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> had
  Consummated the Marriage, which was also proved by good witnesses. In fine,
  since the thing did so much concern the Peace of the Realm, it was fitter to
  judg it within the Kingdom than any where else; therefore he desired the Pope
  would remit the discussing of it to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and then
  confirm the Sentence they should give. To the obtaining of this, the Ambassador
  was to use all possible diligence, yet if he found real intentions in the Pope
  to satisfie the King, he was not to insist on that <pb n="126" facs="tcp:104314:82"/> as the
  Kings final Resolution: And to let the Cardinal of <hi>Ravenna</hi> see, that
  the King intended to make good what was promised in his name, the Bishoprick of
  <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield</hi> falling vacant, he sent him the offer

(who afterward got the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Coventry</hi> and
<hi>Liechfield</hi>) officiate in the Marriage. It was done secretly in the
presence of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and her Father, her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and
Brother, and Dr. <hi>Cranmer.</hi> The grounds on which the King did this,
were, That his former Marriage being of it self null, there was no need of a
Declarative Sentence after so many Universities and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors had given their
judgments against it. Soon after the Marriage she was with-Child, which was
looked on as a signalEvidence of her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, and that she had till then kept
the King at a due distance.</p>

               </note>
Dr. <hi>Bennet</hi> made several propositions to end the matter, either that it
should be judged in <hi>England,</hi> according to the Decree of the Council of
<hi>Nice,</hi> and that the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> with the whole
Clergy of his Province should determine it, or that the King should name one,
either Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> or the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> the Queen
should name another, the <hi>French</hi> King should name a third, and the
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to be the fourth; or that the cause should
be heard in <hi>England,</hi> and if the Queen did Appeal, it should be
referred to three Delegates, one of <hi>England,</hi> another of
<hi>France,</hi> and a third to be sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> who should sit and
judge the Appeal in some indifferent place. But the Pope would hearken to none
of these Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, since they were all directly contrary to that height of
Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he resolved to maintain: Therefore he ordered
<hi>Capisucci</hi> the Dean of the <hi>Rota,</hi> to cite the King to answer to
the Queens Appeal. <hi>Kar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> protested against the
Citation, since the Emperor's Power was so great about <hi>Rome,</hi> that the
King could not expect justice there; and therefore desired they would desist,
otherwise the King would Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Learned men in Universities; and said
there was a nullity in all their proceedings, since the King was a Soveraign
Prince, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> a free Church, over which the Pope
had no just Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>

               <note place="margin">1533.</note>But while this depended at
<hi>Rome,</hi> another Session of Parliameot was held in <hi>England,</hi>
which began to sit on the 4th of <hi>February.</hi> In this the Breach with
<hi>Rome</hi> was much forwarded by the Act they passed against all Appeals to
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Session of Parliament.</note>

 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Act 22.</note> and that the Nation was a compleat Body within
  it self, with a full Power to give justice in all cases Spiritual as well as
  Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral; and that in the Spiritualty as there had beed at all times, so there
  were them men of that sufficiency and integrity, that they might declare and
  determine all doubts within the Kingdom; and that seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <pb n="127" facs="tcp:104314:82"/> Kings, as <hi>Edward</hi> the 1st, <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d,
  <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d,<note place="margin">1533.</note> and <hi>Henry</hi> the
  4th, had by several Laws preserved the Liberties of the Realm, both Spiritual
  and Temporal, from the annoyance of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other
  forreign Potentates; yet many inconveniences had arisen by Appeals to the See
  of <hi>Rome</hi> in Causes of Matrimony, Divorces, and other cases, which were
  not sufficiently provided against by these Laws; by which not only the King and
  his Subjects were put to great charges, but justice was much delayed by
  Appeals, and <hi>Rome</hi> being at such a distance, Evidences could not be
  brought thither nor Witnesses so easily as within the Kingdom: Therefore it was
  Enacted, that all such Causes, whether relating to the King, or any of his
  Subjects, were to be determined within the Kingdom in the several Courts to
  which they belonged, notwithstanding any Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> or
  Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions and Bulls from <hi>Rome</hi>; whose Sentences should take effect,
  and be fully Executed by all Inferior Ministers; and if any Spiritual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
  refused to Execute them because of Censures from <hi>Rome,</hi> they were to
  suffer a years Imprisonment, and fine and ransom at the Kings will; and if any
  Persons in the Kings Dominions procured or executed any Process or Censures
  from <hi>Rome,</hi> they were declared liable to the pains in the Statute of
  <hi>Provisors</hi> in the 16th of <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2d. But that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
  should only be from the Arch-Deacon or his Official to the Bishop of the
  Diocess, or his Commissary, and from him to the Arch-Bishop of the Province, or
  the Dean of the Arches, where the final Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was to be made without
  any further Process, and in every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess concerning the King or his Heirs and
  Successors, an Appeal should lie to the upper House of Convocation, where it
  should be finally De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, never to be again called in question.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As this Bill passed, the sense of both Houses of Parliament about
the Kings Marriage did clearly appear, but in the Convocation the business was
more fully debated. The Convocation of the Province of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was
at this time destitute of its Head and principal Member. For <hi>Warham</hi>
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was dead since <hi>August</hi> last
year.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Warhams</hi> Death, <hi>Aug.</hi> 23.</note> He was
a great Canonist, an able States-man, a dextrous Courtier, and a favourer of
Learned men. He always hated Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> and would never stoop to
him, esteeming it below the Dignity of his See. He was not so peevishly engaged
to the Learning of the Schools as others were, but set up and encouraged a more
generous way of Knowledge; yet he was a severe persecutor of them whom he
thought Hereticks, and enclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe idle and Fanatical people, as will
afterwards appear, when the Impostures of the Maid of <hi>Kent</hi> shall be
related.</p>
            <p>The King saw well of how great importance it was to the designes
he was then forming, to fill that See, with a Learned,<note place="margin">The
  King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>Cranmer.</hi>
               </note> Prudent, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute man;
but finding none in the Episcopal Order that was qualified to his mind, and
having observed a native simplicity joyned with much cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and tempered
with a great deal of wisdom, in Dr. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who was then Negotiating
his business among the Learned men of <hi>Germany,</hi> he of his own accord
without any adresses from <hi>Cranmer,</hi> designed to raise him to that
Dignity, and gave him notice of it, that he might make hast and come home to
enjoy that reward which the King had appointed for him. But <hi>Cranmer</hi>
having received this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fox.</hi>
               </note> did all he could
to excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the burden which was coming upon him; and therefore he
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned <pb n="128" facs="tcp:104314:83"/> very slowly to <hi>England,</hi> hoping that
the Kings thoughts cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, some other person might step in between him and a
Dignity, of which having a just and primitive sense, he did look on it with
fear and apprehension, rather than joy and desire. This was so far from setting
him back, that the King (who had known well what it was to be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned by
ambitious and aspiring Churchmen, but had not found it usual that they should
decline and fly from Preferment) was thereby confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his high opinion of
him; and neither the delays of his Journey, nor his Intreaties to be delivered
from a Burden, which his Humility made him imagine himself unable to bear,
could divert the King. So that though six moneths elapsed before the thing was
settled, yet the King persisted in his Opinion, and the other was forced to
yield.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cranmers</hi> Bulls from
  <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note>In the end of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the King sent to the Pope
for the Bulls for <hi>Cranmers</hi> Promotion; and though the Statutes were
passed against pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing more Bulls from <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the King resolved
not to begin the breach till he was forced to it by the Pope. It may be easily
imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Pope was not hearty in this Promotion, and that he
appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ill consequences from the Advancement of a Man, who had gone over
many Courts of Christendom, disputing against his Power of Dispensing, and had
lived in much Familiarity with <hi>Osiander</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in
<hi>Germany:</hi> Yet on the other hand he had no mind to precipitate a Rupture
with <hi>England</hi>; therefore he consented to it, and the Bulls were
expedited, though instead of <hi>Annates</hi> there was onely 900 Ducats paid
for them.</p>
            <p>They were the last Bulls that were received in <hi>England</hi> in
this Kings Reign; and therefore I shall give an account of them, as they are
set down in the beginning of <hi>Cranmers</hi> Register. By one Bull he is upon
the Kings Nomination, promoted to be Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which
is directed to the King. By a second directed to himself, he is made
Archbishop. By a third he is absolved from all Censures. A fourth is to the
Suffragans. A fifth to the Dean and Chapter. A sixth to the Clergy of
<hi>Canterbury.</hi> A seventh to all the Laity in his See. An eighth to all
that held Lands of it, requiring them to receive and acknowledge him as
Archbishop. All these bear Date the 21th. of <hi>February,</hi> 1533. By a
ninth Bull dated the 22th. of <hi>February</hi> he was ordained to be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated, taking the Oath that was in the <hi>Pontifical.</hi> By a tenth
Bull da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the second of <hi>March</hi> the Pall was sent him. And by an
eleventh of the same Date the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> and the Bishop of
<hi>London</hi> were required to put it on him. These were the several
Artifices to make Compositions high, and to enrich the Apostolick Chamber, for
now that about which S. <hi>Peter</hi> gloried, that he had none of it,
(<hi>neither silver nor gold</hi>) was the thing in the world for which his
Successors were most careful.</p>
            <p>When these Bulls were brought into <hi>England, Thomas
Cranmer</hi> was on the 13th. of <hi>March</hi> consecrated by the Bishops of
<hi>Lincoln, Exeter,</hi> and <hi>S. Asaph.</hi> But here a great Scruple was
moved by him concerning the Oath that he was to swear to the Pope, which he had
no mind to take; and Writers near that time say, the dislike of that Oath was
one of the motives that made him so unwillingly accept of that Dignity. He
declared, that he thought there were many things settled by the Laws of the
Popes, which ought to be reformed, and that the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104314:83"/> which that Oath brought upon him, would bind him up from
do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Duty both to God, the King, and the Church. But this being
communicated to some of the Canonists and Casuists,<note place="margin">His
  Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about his Oath to the Pope.</note> they found a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that
agreed better with their Maxims, than <hi>Cranmers</hi> sincerity; which was,
that before he should take the Oath, he should make a good and formal
Protestation, That he did not intend thereby to restrain himself from any thing
that he was bound to either by his Duty to God, or the King, or the Countrey;
and that he renounced every thing in it that was contrary to any of these. This
Protestation he made in S. <hi>Stephens</hi> Chapel at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in
the hands of some Doctors of the Canon Law before he was consecrated, and he
afterwards repeated it when he took the Oath to the Pope; by which if he did
not wholly save his Integrity, yet it was plain he intended no Cheat, but to
act fairly and above board.</p>
            <p>As soon as he was consecrated, and had performed every thing that
was necessary for his Investiture, he came and sate in the Upper House of
Convocation.<note place="margin">

               </note> There were there at that time hot and earnest
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates upon these two Questions; Whether it was against the Law of God, and
Indispensable by the Pope, for a man to marry his Brothers Wife, he being dead
without Issue, but having consummated the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage? And whether Prince
<hi>Arthur</hi> had consummated his Marriage with the Queen? As for the first,
it was brought first into the Lower House of Convocation, and when it was put
to the Vote, 14 were for the Affirmative, 7 for the Negative; one was not
clear, and another voted the Prohibition to be Moral, but yet dispensable by
the Pope. In the Upper House it was long debated, <hi>Stokesly</hi> Bishop of
<hi>London</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Affirmative, and <hi>Fisher</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Rochester</hi> for the Negative. The Opinions of 19 Universities were read
for it, and the oneHouse being as full as the other was empty, 216 being
present either in person or by Proxy, it was carried in the Affirmative
<hi>Nemine contradicente</hi>; those few of the Queens party that were there it
seems going out. For the other Question about the Matter ofFact, it was
remitted to the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Canon Law, (it being a matter that lay within
their St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dies) whether the
Presumptions were violent, and such as in the course of Law must be look'd on
as good Evidences of a thing that was secret, and was not capable of formal
proof? They all except five or six were for the Affirmative, and all the Upper
House confirmed this, the Bishop of <hi>Bath and Wells</hi> onely excepted.</p>
            <p>In this account it may seem strange, that there were but 23
persons in the Lower House of Convocation, and 216 in the Upper House. It is
taken from an unquestioned Authority, so the Matter of Fact is not to be
doubted. The most Learned Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> has in no place of his
Collection of our Councils, considered the Constitution of the two Houses of
Convocation; and in none of our Records have I been able to discover of what
persons they were made up in the Times of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and therefore since we are
left to conjecture, I shall offer mine to the learned Reader. It is, that none
sate in the Lower House, but those who were deputed by the inferiour Clergy;
and that Bishops, Abbots Mitered and not Mitered, and Priors, Deans and
Archdeacons, sate then in the Upper House of Convocation. To which I am induced
by these two Reasons: It is probable that all who were declared
<hi>Prelates</hi> by <pb n="130" facs="tcp:104314:84"/> the Pope,<note place="margin">1532.</note> and had their Writ to sit in a General Council, had
likewise a right to come to the Upper House of Convocation, and sit with the
other Prelates. And we find in the Tomes of the Councils, that not onely Abbots
and Priors, but Deans and Archdeacons were summoned to the fourth Council in
the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and to that at <hi>Vienna.</hi> Another Reason is, that
their sitting in two Houses (for in all other Nations they sit together) looks
as if it had been taken from the Constitution of our Parliament, in which all
that have Writs personally sit in the Lords House; and those who come upon an
Election sit in the Lower House. So it is not improbable, that all who were
summoned personally sate in the Upper House, and those who were returned with
an Election, sate in the Lower House of Convocation.</p>
            <p>This Account of that Convocation I take from that Collection of
the <hi>British</hi> Antiquities, which is believed to have been made by
<hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> who lived at that time, and was afterwards Archbishop
of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.</hi> But the Convocation Books being burnt, there are no
Records to be appealed to; yet it is not to be supposed, that in a Matter of
Fact that was so publick and well known, any man (especially one of that high
Rank) would have delivered Falshoods, while the Books were yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant that
would have disproved them.</p>

               <note place="margin">New Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make the Queen
  submit.</note>The Church of <hi>England</hi> having in her Representative made
such a full Decision, nothing remained but to give Judgment, and to declare the
Marriage Null. The thing was already determined, onely the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of a
Sentence Declarative was wanting. But before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that, a new
Message was sent to the Queen, to lay all that had passed before her, and to
desire her to acquiesce in the Opinions of so many Universities and Learned
Men. But she still persisted in her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to own her Marriage, and to
adhere to her Appeal till the Pope should judge in it. And when it was told
her, that the King would set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Joynture that she was to have by his
Brother, and that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Princess of <hi>Wales</hi> should still be
paid her, she rejected it. But the new Queen was now with child,<note place="margin">But in vain.</note> and brought forth Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
the 7th. of <hi>September</hi> this year; from which looking backwards nine
moneths, to the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> it shews that she must have
been married at or before that time: for all the Writers of both sides agree,
that she was married before she conceived with child. The King therefore
thought not fit to conceal it much longer, so on <hi>Easter</hi> Eve she was
declared Queen of <hi>England.</hi> It seems it was not thought needful at that
time to proceed to any further Sentence about the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Marriage, otherwise I
cannot see what made it be so long delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, since the thing was in their power
now, as well as after. And it was certainly a preposterous Method to judge the
first Marriage Null, after the second was published. So that it seems more
probable, they did not intend any Sentence at all, till afterwards perhaps upon
Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements from beyond Sea, they went on to a formal Process. Nor is it
unlikely that the King remembering the old Advice that the Pope sent him, once
to marry a second Wife, and then to send for a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to try the matter,
which the Pope was willing to confirm, though he would not seem to allow it
originally, resolved to follow this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; for the Pope was now closing with
<hi>Francis,</hi> from which Union the King had reason to expect great
Advantages.</p>

Delay,<note place="margin">1533.</note> the Process was framed in this Method.
First, <hi>Cranmer</hi> wrote to the King, that the World had been long
scandalized with his Marriage, and that it lay on him as his Duty to see it
tried and determined; therefore craved his Royal Leave to proceed in it. Which

make the Sentence firmer, the Reader may judge. Sentence being given, the
Archbishop with all the rest returned to <hi>London</hi>; and five days after
on the 28th. of <hi>May,</hi> at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> by another Judgment he in
general words (no Reasons being given in the Sentence) confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Kings
Marriage with the new Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and the first of <hi>Iune</hi> she
was crowned Queen.</p>
            <p>When this great Business, which had been so long in
agitation,<note place="margin">The Censures past at that time.</note> was thus
concluded, it was variously censured as men stood affected. Some approved the
Kings Proceedings as Canonical and Just, since so many Authorities, which in
the intervall of a General Council were all that could be had, (except the Pope
be believed <hi>Infallible</hi>) had concurred to strengthen the Cause; and his
own Clergy had upon a full and long exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination judged it on his side. Others,
who in the main agreed to the Divorce, did very much dislike the Kings second
Marriage before the first was dissolved; for they thought it against the common
course of Law, to break a Marriage without any publick Sentence; and since one
of the chief politick Reasons that was made use of in this Suit, was to settle
the Succession of the Crown, this did embroil it more, since there was a fair
colour given to except to the Validity of the second Marriage, because it was
contracted before the first was annulled. But to this others answered, That the
first Marriage being judged by the Interpreters of the Doctrine of the Church,
to have been Null from the beginning, there was no need of any Sentence, but
onely for Form. And all concluded, it had been better there had been no
Sentence at all, than one so late. <pb n="132" facs="tcp:104314:85"/> Some excepted to the
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s being Judge, who by his former Writings and
Disputes had declared himself partial. But to this it was answered, That when a
man changes his Character, all that he did in another Figure is no just
Exception: so Judges decide Causes in which they formerly gave Counsel; and
Popes are not bound to the Opinions they held when they were Divines or
Canonists. It was also said, That the Archbishop did onely declare in Legal
Form, that which was already judged by the whole Convocation of both Provinces.
Some wondered at the Popes stifness, that would put so much to hazard, when
there wanted not as good Colours to justifie a Bull, as they had made use of to
excuse many other things. But the Emperors Greatness, and the fear of giving
the <hi>Lutherans advantages</hi> in disputing the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, were on
the other hand so prevalent Considerations, that no wonder they wrought much on
a Pope, who pretended to no other knowledge but that of Policy; for he had
often said, <hi>He understood not the matter,</hi> and therefore left it in
other mens hands. All persons excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Queen <hi>Katharine</hi> for standing so
stifly to her ground; onely her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying so confidently that Prince
<hi>Arthur</hi> consummated the Marriage, seems not capable of an Excuse. Every
body admired Queen <hi>Annes</hi> Conduct, who had managed such a Kings Spirit
so long, and had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther surfeited him with great freedom, nor provoked him by
the other Extreme: for the King, who was extremely nice in these matters,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived still an higher Opinion of her; and her being so soon with child
after the Marriage, as it made people conclude she had been chaste till then,
so they hoped for a Blessing upon it, since there were such early appearances
of Issue. Those that favoured the Reformation expected better days under her
Protection, for they know she favoured them: But those who were in their hearts
for the Established Religion did much dislike it; and many of the Clergy,
especially the Orders of Monks and Friars, condemned it both in their Sermons
and Discourses.</p>
            <p>But the King little regarding the Censures of the Vulgar, sent
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors to all the Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> to give notice of his new
Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and to justifie it by some of those Reasons, which have been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the former parts of this History. He also sent the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> to
the Divorced Queen, to let her know what was done, and that she was no more to
be treated as <hi>Queen,</hi> but as <hi>Princess Dowager.</hi> He was to mix
Promises with Threatnings, particularly concerning her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being put
next the Queens Issue in the Succession. But the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Queen would not
yield, and said she would not damn her Soul, nor submit to such an Infamy: That
she was his Wife, and would never call her self by any other Name, whatever
might follow on it, since the Process still depended at <hi>Rome.</hi> That
Lord having written a Relation of what had passed between him and her,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cott. lib. Otho. C.</hi> 10.</note> shewed it to her; but she
dashed with a Pen all those places in which she was called Princess Dowager;
and would receive no Service at any ones hands, but of those who called her
Queen: and she continued to be still served as Queen by all about her. Against
which though the King used all the Endeavours he could, not without both
threatning and violence to some of the Servants, yet he could never drive her
from it: and what he did in that, was thought far below that Height of Mind
which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his other Actings; for since he had stript her of the real 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104314:85"/> Greatness of a Queen, it seemed too much, to vex her for
keeping up the Pageantry of it.</p>
            <p>But the news of this made great impressions elsewhere. The
Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror received the Kings justification very coldly, and said

it would preserve that Kingdom in his obedience, so would perhaps frighten the
King of <hi>England</hi> from proceeding to such extremities; since that
Prince, in whose conjunction he trusted so much, had forsaken him: Therefore
the Pope did so vigorously pursue the Treaty with <hi>Francis,</hi> that it was
as good as ended at this time, and an Interview was projected between them at
<hi>Marseilles.</hi> The Pope did also grant him so great Power over his own
Clergy, that he could s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arce have
expected more, if he had set up a Patriarch in <hi>France</hi>; so that
<hi>Francis</hi> did resolve to go on in the designs, which had been concerted
between him and the King of <hi>England,</hi> no further; but still he
considered his alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance so much, that he promised to use his most effectual
intercession with the Pope to prevent all Censures and Bulls against the King;
and if it were possible to bring the matter to an Amicable conclusion. And the
Emperor was not ill-pleased to see <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi>
divided. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he had at first opposed the Treaty between the Pope
and <hi>Francis,</hi> yet afterwards he was not troubled that it took effect,
hoping that it would dis-unite those two Kings, whose conjunction had been so
troublesome to him.</p>
            <p>But when the news was brought to <hi>Rome</hi> of what was done in
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in

               </note> with which it was also related that Books were coming
out against the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> all the Cardinals of the Imperial
Faction pressed the Pope to give a definitive Sentence, and to proceed to
Censures against the King. But the more moderate Cardinals thought,
<hi>England</hi> was not to be thrown away with such precipitation: And
therefore a temper was found, that a Sentence should be given upon what had
been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England,</hi> by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
(which in the Stile of the Canon-Law were called the <hi>Attentates,</hi>) for
it was pretended that the matter depending in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by
the Queens Appeal and the other steps that had been made, it was not in the
Arch-Bishop's Power to proceed to any Sentence. Therefore in general it was
declared, that all that had been attempted or done in <hi>England</hi> about
the Kings Suit of Divorce was null, and that the King by such attempts was
liable to Excommunication, unless he put things again in the state they were
in, and that before <hi>September</hi> next, and that then they would proceed
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and this Sentence was affixed in <hi>Dunkirk</hi> soon after.</p>
            <p>The King resolving to follow the thing as far as it was possible,
sent a great Embassy to <hi>Francis,</hi> who was then on his Journey to
<hi>Marseilles,</hi> to dissuade the Interview and Marriage, till the Pope gave
the King satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the <hi>French</hi> King was engaged in honour to
go forward; yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested <pb n="134" facs="tcp:104314:86"/> he would do all that lay in
his Power to compose the matter, and that he would take any injury that were
done to the King as highly, as if it were done to himself; and he desired the
King would send some to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> who thereupon sent
<hi>Gardiner</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Brian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But at this time the Queen brought forth a Daughter, who was

<hi>Marseilles,</hi> who procuring an Audience of the Pope, delivered to him
the Authentick Instrument of the Kings Appeal from him to the next general
Council lawfully called. At this the Pope was much incensed, but said he would
consider of it in Consistory; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consulted about it there, he answered
that the Appeal was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therefore he rejected it; and for a general
Council, the calling of it belonged to him, and not to the King. About the same
time the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being threatned with a Process from
<hi>Rome,</hi> put in also his Appeal to the next general Council. Upon which
<hi>Bonner</hi> delivered the threatnings that he was ordered to make, with so
much vehemency and fury, that the Pope talked of throwing him in a Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of
melted Lead, or of Burning him alive; and he apprehending some danger made his
escape. About the middle of <hi>November</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview ended, the Pope
returning to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> a
firm Alliance being established between them. But upon the Duke of
<hi>Orleance</hi> his Marrying the Pope's Neece, I shall add one observation,
that will neither be unpleasant nor impertinent. The Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi>
was then but Fourteen years and Nine Months old, being born on the last of

            <p>Upon the <hi>French</hi> Kings return from <hi>Marseilles,</hi>
the Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> 
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:104314:86"/> was sent over to the King;
which (as may be reasonably collected,) followed upon some Agreement made at
<hi>Marseilles,</hi> and he prevailed with the King to submit the whole matter
to the Pope and the Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, on such terms that the Imperialists should not
be allowed a Voice, because they were Parties, being in the Emperor's Power.

un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken a Journey from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> But the King, it
seems, would not abase himself so far as to send any Submission in writing,
till he had fuller assurances. The Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> has published a Letter
(which he transcribed from the Original, written by the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>York</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Duresm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

giving an account of a Conference they had with Queen <hi>Katharine</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in which, among other motives they used, this was one, to perswade her to
comply with what the King had done: <hi>That the Pope had said at</hi>
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seilles, <hi>that if the King would send a Proxy to</hi> Rome, <hi>he would
give the Cause for him against the Queen, because he knew his Cause was good
and just.</hi> Which is a great presumption, that the Pope did really give some
engagements to the <hi>French</hi> King about the King's business.</p>
            <p>When the Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> the
Motion was liked,<note place="margin">Which was well received at
  <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> and it was promised, that if the King sent a promise of
that under his Hand, with an Order to his Proxies to appear in Court, there
should be Judges sent to <hi>Cambray</hi> to form the Process, and then the
matter should be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for him at <hi>Rome.</hi> This was sent to the

  Paule.</hi>
               </note> with the Notice of the day that was prefixed for the return
of his answer, and with other Motives which must have been very great, since
they prevailed so much. For in answer there was a Courier dispatcht from the
King, with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal promise under his Hand. And now the matter seemed at a
point, the <hi>French</hi> Interest was great in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>;
four new Cardinals had been made at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and there were six of
that Faction before, which with the Popes Creatures, and the indifferent or
venal Voices, ballanced the Imperial Faction, so that a wound that was looked
on as fatal, was now almost healed. But God in his wise and unsearchable
Providence had designed to draw other great ends out of this Rupture, and
therefore suffered them that were the most concerned to hinder it, to be the
chief instruments of driving it on.<note place="margin">But the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists
  op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it.</note> For the Cardinals of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Faction were now very
active, they liked not the President of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Cardinals of the Nations
concern'd, out of any business. But above all things they were to hinder a
Conjunction between the Pope and the King of <hi>England</hi>; for the Pope
being then allied to <hi>France,</hi> there was nothing the Emperor feared more
than the closing the Breach with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which would make the union
against him so much stronger. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the day that had been prefixed
for the return of the Courier from <hi>England,</hi> was elapsed, they all
pressed the Pope to proceed to a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence Definitive and to Censures.
<hi>Bellay</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> represented the injustice of
proceeding with so much Precipitation, since where there were Seas to cross, in
such a Season, many accidents might occasion the delay of the Express. The King
of <hi>England</hi> had followed this Suit six years, and had patience so long;
therefore he desired the delay of six <pb n="136" facs="tcp:104314:87"/> dayes,<note place="margin">1531.</note> and if in that time no return came, they might
proceed. But the Imperialists represented, that those were only delays to gain
time; and that the King of <hi>England</hi> was still proceeding in his
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Apostolick See, and of the Cardinals, and publishing Books and
Libels against them. This so wrought on the angry Pope, that without consulting
his ordinary prudence, he brought the business into the Consistory,<note place="margin">And with great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration procure a sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the
  King.</note> where the Plurality of voices carryed it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a
Sentence. And though the Process had been carryed on all that winter in their
usual Forms, yet it was not so ripe, but by the Rules of the Consistory, there
ought to have been three Sessions before Sentence was given. But they concluded
all in one day, and so on the 23d of <hi>March,</hi> the Marriage between the
King and Queen <hi>Katharine</hi> was declared good, and the King required to
take her as his wife; otherwise Censures were to be denounced against him.</p>
            <p>Two days after that, the Courier arrived from <hi>England,</hi>
with the Kings Submission under his hand in due Form, and earnest Letters from
the <hi>French</hi> King to have it accepted, that so the business might be
composed. When this was known at <hi>Rome</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

was <hi>Farnese,</hi> that was afterwards Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d.) came to
the Pope, and desired that it might be again considered before it went fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her. So it was brought again into the
Consistory. But the secret reason of the Imperialists opposing it, was now more
pressing, since there was such an appearance of a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, if the former
Sentence were once recalled. Therefore they so managed the matter, that it was
confirmed a-new by the Pope and the Consistory, and they ordered the Emperor to
execute the Sentence.</p>

this Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick account of his unprosperous Negotiation. When the King heard

submission, he resolved then to break totally from <hi>Rome.</hi> And in this,

Submission to the King. And that led them to controvert the Popes right to
<hi>Annates,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Exactions, which they also condemned. The
Condemning all appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> followed that naturally. And now so
many branches of that Power were cut off, the Root was next struck at, and the 
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104314:87"/> Foundations of the Papal Authority were examined.<note place="margin">1532.</note> For near a year together there, had been many publick
debates about it; and both in the Parliament and Convocation the thing was long
disputed,<note place="margin">

               </note> (and thereby of the ripeness
of their judgments, when they Enacted the Laws that passed in this Parliament,)
when he sees a full account of them; which I shall next set down, not drawn
from the Writings and Apologies that have been published since, but from these
that came out about that time. For then were written the <hi>Institution for
the Necessary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudition of a Christian man,</hi> Concluded in the Convocation,
and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by Authority; and another Book, <hi>De Differentia Regiae &amp;
Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticae Potestatis.</hi> The former of these was called the Bishops,
and the latter the Kings Book. <hi>Gardiner</hi> also wrote a Book, <hi>De vera
Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientia,</hi> to which <hi>Bonner</hi> prefixed a Preface upon the same
Subject. <hi>Stokesly</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Tonstal</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Duresm,</hi> wrote a long Letter in defence of the Kings
Proceedings in this matter to <hi>Reginald,</hi> (soon after, Cardinal)
<hi>Pool</hi>: from these writings, and the Sermons preached by some Bishops at
this time, with other Authentick pieces. I have Extracted the Substance of the
Arguments upon which they grounded their Laws, which I shall divide in two
heads. The one of the reasons for rejecting the Popes pretended Power. The
other for setting up the Kings Supremacy with the Explanations and Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of it.</p>
            <q> 
               <p> First, of the Popes Power,<note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon
  which it was rejected.</note> they declared that they found no ground for it in
the Scripture. All the Apostles were made equal by Christ, when he committed
the Church to their care in Common. And he did often declare, there was no
Superiority of one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. St. <hi>Paul</hi> claimed an equality with
the chief Apostles both <hi>Peter, Iames, and Iohn</hi>; and when he thought
St. <hi>Peter</hi> blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, he <hi>withstood him to his face.</hi> But
whatsoever Preheminence St. <hi>Peter</hi> might have, that was only Personal,
and there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to affix it to his Chair at <hi>Rome,</hi> more than
at <hi>Antioch.</hi> But if any See be to be preferred before another, it
should be <hi>Ierusalem</hi> where <hi>Christ</hi> dyed, and out of which the
Faith was propagated over all Nations, Christ commanding his Disciples to begin
their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it; so that it was truly the <hi>Mother Church,</hi> and is
so called by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whereas in the Scripture, <hi>Rome</hi> is
called <hi>Babylon,</hi> according to <hi>Tertullian</hi> and St.
<hi>Ierome.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> For the places brought from Scripture in favor of the Papacy,
they judged that they did not prove any thing for it. That <hi>Thou art
Peter,</hi> and <hi>upon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi> if it prove any
thing in this matter, would prove too much; even that the Church was founded on
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as he was a private person, and so on the Popes in their
Personal Capacity. But both St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> and St.
<hi>Austin,</hi> think, that by the <hi>Rock,</hi> the Confession he had made
was only to be meant. Others of the Fathers thought by the <hi>Rock,
Christ</hi> himself was meant, who is the only true Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church;
though in another sense all the Apostles are also called Foundations by St.
<hi>Paul.</hi> That, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> is thought by <hi>Gerson</hi>
and <hi>Aeneas Silvius,</hi> (afterwards Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 2d.) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104314:88"/> to make against the Pope and for a General Council. And
the Fathers have generally followed St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and St.
<hi>Austin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1533.</note> who thought that, <hi>the
giving of the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and the Charge, <hi>Feed my
Sheep,</hi> were addressed to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in behalf of all the rest of
the Apostles. And that, <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith sail
not,</hi> was only Personal, and related to his Fall, which was then Imminent.
It is also clear by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that every Apostle had his peculiar
Province, beyond which he was not to Stretch himself; and St. <hi>Peters</hi>
Province was the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and his, the Uncircumcision, in which he
plainly declares his Equality with him.</p> 
               <p> This was also clear from the constant Tradition of the Church.
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was against Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and would not submit
to P. <hi>Stephens</hi> definition in the point of Re-baptizing of Hereticks;
and expresly says, <hi>That all the Apostles were equal in Power, and that all
the Bishops were also equal, since the whole Office and Episcopate was one
entire thing, of which every Bishop had a compleat and equall share.</hi> And
though some places are brought out of him concerning the Unity of the Roman
Church, and of other Churches with it; yet those places have no relation to any
Authority that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church had over other Churches, but were
occasioned by a Schism that <hi>Novatian</hi> had made there at <hi>Rome,</hi>
being Elected in opposition to the Bishop that was rightly chosen: and of that
unity only St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes in those places. But from all his
Epistles to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is visible he look't on himself
as their Equal, since he calls them <hi>Brother, Collegue,</hi> and
<hi>Fellow-Bishop.</hi> And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is said by any Ancient Writer of St.
<hi>Peters</hi> Chair, is to be understood of the pure Gospel, which he
delivered, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes, that by <hi>Moses Chair,</hi> is to
be understood <hi>The delivering of Moses Law.</hi> But though St.
<hi>Peter</hi> sate there, the succeeding Popes have no more right to pretend
to such Authority, than the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> to claim the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, because he that is now their King, is Emperor. When
<hi>Constantine</hi> turned Christian, the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the chief City of the
Empire made <hi>Rome</hi> to be accounted the first See, but by the General
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> it was declared, that the Patriarches of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> had the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the
Countries round about them, that he of <hi>Rome</hi> had over those that lay
about that City. It is true, at tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> time the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie, having spread Generally over the
<hi>Eastern</hi> Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from which the <hi>Western</hi> were free; the
oppressed Catholick Bishops of the <hi>East</hi> made Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and extolled that See by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Maxime in all men, who magnifie that from
which they have Protection. But the Second general Council took care, that that
should not grow a President, for they Decreed that every Province should be
governed by its own Synod, and that Bishops when they were accused, must first
be judged by the Bishops of their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and from them they might
appeal to the Bishops of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess but no higher appeal was allowed: and by
that Council it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; what was the Foundation of the greatness of the
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for when <hi>Constantinople</hi> was made the Seat of
the Empire and <hi>New Rome,</hi> it had the same Privileges that <hi>Old
Rome</hi> had, and <pb n="139" facs="tcp:104314:88"/> was set next to it in order and
dignity.<note place="margin">1534.</note> In a Council at <hi>Milevi</hi> in
which St. <hi>Austin</hi> sate, they appointed that every Clerk, that should
appeal to any Bishop beyond the Sea, should be excommunicated. And when
<hi>Faustianus</hi> was sent by the Pope to the <hi>African</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to
claim the Right of receiving appeals, and pretended a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Council of
<hi>Nice</hi> for it, the Pretension was rejected by the <hi>Af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ican</hi> Fathers, who acknowledged no
such Right, and had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of that Canon. Upon which they sent to the
<hi>East<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rn</hi> Churches, and
search was every-where made for the Copies of the Canons of that Council, but
it was found that it was a Forgery. From whence two things were observable: The
one, that the Church in that Age had no Tradition of any Divine Institution for
the Authority of that See, since as the Popes, who claimed it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended
to any such thing; so the <hi>African</hi> Bishops by their rejecting that
Power, shew, that they knew nothing of any Divine Warrant, all the Contest
being only about a Canon of the Church. It also appeared how early the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> aspired to Power, and did not stick at making use of Forged
writings to support it. But Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> more modestly writing to the
Emperor in his own name, and in the name of all the Synods that were Subject to
his See, calls them <hi>a few Bishops in the Northern and Western Parts.</hi>
When after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was declared by the
Emperor <hi>Mauritius, The Vniversal Bishop, Gregory the great</hi> did exclaim
against the Ambition of that Title, as being equal to the Pride of
<hi>Lucifer,</hi> and declared, that he who assumed it was the Forerunner of
<hi>Antichrist</hi>; saying, that none of his Predecessors had ever claimed
such a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And this was the more observable, since the <hi>English</hi>
were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by those whom he sent over; so that this was the Doctrine of
that See, when this Church received the Faith from it.</p> 
               <p> But it did not continue long within those limits; for
<hi>Boniface</hi> the Third assumed that Title, upon the Grant of <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>as.</hi> And as that <hi>Boniface</hi>
got the Spiritual Sword put in his hand, so the Eighth of that name pretended
also to the Temporal Sword; but they owe these Powers to the Industry of those
Popes, and not to any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Christs.</hi> The Popes when they are
Consecrated promise to obey the Canons of the Eight first General Councils,
which if they observe, they will receive no Appeals, nor pretend to any high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Jurisdiction than these give to them, and the other Patriarchs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually.</p> 
               <p> As for the Decrees of Latter Councils, they are of less
Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For those Councils consisted of Monks and Friers in great part,
whose exemptions obtained from <hi>Rome</hi> obliged them to support the
Authority of that Court; and those who sate in them knew little of the
Scriptures, Fathers, or the Tradition of the Church, being only conversant in
the Disputes and Learning of the Schools. And for the <hi>Florentine</hi>
Council, the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches, who sent the <hi>Greek</hi> Bishops
that sate there, never received their Determination, neither then, nor at any
time since.</p> 
               <p> Many places were also brought out of the Fathers to show, that
they did not look on the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> as superior to other Bishops;
and that they understood not those places of Scripture, which were 
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104314:89"/> afterwards brought for the Popes Supremacy, in that
sense; so that if Tradition be the best Expounder of Scripture, those latter
glosses must give place to the more ancient. But that passage of St.
<hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> in which he equals the Bishops of <hi>Eugubium</hi> and
<hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was much made use of,
since he was a Presbyter of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so likely to understand the
Dignity of his own Church best. There were many things brought from the
Contests that other Sees had with <hi>Rome,</hi> to show, that all the
Priviledges of that and other Sees, were only founded on the practice and
Canons of the Church, but not upon any Divine War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. <hi>Constantinople</hi>
pretended to equal priviledges. <hi>Ravenna, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> and
<hi>Aquileia,</hi> pretended to a Patriarchal Dignity and Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some
Arch-Bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> contended, that Popes could do nothing
against the Laws of the Church; so <hi>Laurence</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan. Robert
Grostest</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> asserted the same, and many Popes
confessed it. And to this day no Constitution of the Popes is binding in any
Church, except it be received by it; and in the daily practice of the Canon
Law, the customs of Churches are plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against Papal Constitutions; which
shows their Authority can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be from God, otherwise all must submit to their
Laws. And from the latter Contests up and down <hi>Europe,</hi> about giving
Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitures, receiving Appeals, admitting of Legates, and Papal
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, it was apparent, that the Papal Authority was a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which
had been managed by cruel and fraudulent Arts, but was never otherwise received
in the Church, than as a Conquest to which they were constrained to yield. And
this was more fully made out in <hi>England,</hi> from what passed in
<hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d's time, and by the
Statutes of <hi>Provisors</hi> in many Kings Reigns, which were still renewed,
till within an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years of the present time.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Upon these grounds they Concluded, that the Popes Power in
<hi>England</hi> had no Foundation, neither in the Law of God, nor in the Laws
of the Church or of the Land.</p>

  Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</note>As for the Kings Power over Spiritual persons, and in
Spiritual causes, they proved it from the Scriptures. In the old Testament they
found the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> intermedled in all matters Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical.
<hi>Samuel,</hi> though he had been Judge, yet acknowledged <hi>Sauls</hi>
Authority:<note place="margin">From the old Testament.</note> So also did
<hi>Abimelech</hi> the High-Priest, and appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him when cited to
answer upon an Accusation. And <hi>Samuel</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.18.) sayes,
<hi>he was made the head of all the Tribes. Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> in that, was an
Example to all the following High-Priests who submitted to <hi>Moses.
David</hi> made many Laws about sacred things, such as, the Order of the
Courses of the Priests and their Worship; and when he was dying, he declared to
<hi>Solomon</hi> how far his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority extended. He told him, 1
<hi>Chron.</hi> 28.21. <hi>That the Courses of the Priests and all the people
were to be wholly at his commandment:</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant to which <hi>Solomon,</hi>
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.14, 15. did appoint them <hi>their charges in the service
of God, and both the Priests and Levites departed not from his commandment in
any matter</hi>: and though he had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the
High-Priesthood, yet they made no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. <hi>Iehosophat, Hezekiah</hi>
and <hi>Iosias</hi> made likewise Laws about Eccledsiastical Matters.</p> 
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:104314:89"/> In the New Testament, Christ himself was
obedient,<note place="margin">1533.</note> he payed Taxes, he declared that he
pretended to no earthly Kingdom, he charged the people to <hi>render to Caesar
the things that were Caesars,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And the New</note> and his
Disciples not to affect temporal dominion, as the Lords of the Nations did. And
though the Magistrates were then Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, yet the Apostles wrote to the
Churches to obey Magistrates, to submit to them, to pay Taxes, they call the
King <hi>Supream</hi> and say he is Gods Minister to encourage them that do
well, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the evil doors, which is said of all persons without
exception, and every Soul is charged to be subject to the Higher Power.</p> 
               <p> Many passages were cited out of the Writings of the Fathers, to
show, that they thought Church-men, were included in these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as well as
other persons, so that the Tradition of the Church was for the Kings Supremacy:
and by one place of Scripture the King is called <hi>Supream,</hi> by another
he is called <hi>Head,</hi> and by a third <hi>every Soul must be subject to
him,</hi> which laid together, make up this conclusion, <hi>That the King is
the Supream Head over all persons.</hi> In the primitive Church, the Bishops in
their Councils made rules for ordering their Dioceses, which they only called
<hi>Canons</hi> or <hi>Rules,</hi> nor had they any compulsive Authority, but
what was derived from the Civil Sanctions.</p> 
               <p> After the Emperors were Christians, they made many Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
sacred things, as may be seen in the <hi>Codes</hi>;<note place="margin">And the
  Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises of the primitive Church.</note> and when <hi>Iustinian</hi> digested
the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, he added many <hi>Novel Constitutions</hi> about
Ecclesiastical persons and causes. The Emperors called general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
presided in them, and confirmed them. And many Letters were cited of Popes to
Emperors, to call Councils, and of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to them to Confirm their
Decrees. The Election of the Popes themselves, was sometimes made by the
Emperors, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confirmed by them. Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> in a Synod
decreed, that the Emperor should choose the Pope: And it was a late and unheard
of thing, before the dayes of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th, for Popes to pretend to
depose Princes, and give away their Dominions. This they compared to the pride
of <hi>Anti-Christ</hi> and <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> They also argued from Reason,<note place="margin">And from
  Reason.</note> that there must be but one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream; and that the King being
Supream over all his Subjects, Clergy-men must be included, for they are still
Subjects. Nor can their being in Orders, change that former relation, founded
upon the Law of Nature and Nations, no more than Wives or Servants, by becoming
Christians, were not, according to the Doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, discharged
from the Duties of their former Relations.</p> 
               <p> For the great Objection from those Offices that are peculiar to
their Functions, It was answered, that these notwithstanding the King might
well be Supream Head; for in the Natural body, there were many vital motions
that proceeded not from the Head, but from the Heart, and the other inward
parts and vessels; and yet the Head was still the chief seat and root of Life:
So though there be peculiar functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appropriated to Church-men, yet the King
is still Head, having Authority over them, and a Power to direct and coerce
them in these.<note place="margin">And from the Laws of
  <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p> 
               <p> From that, they proceeded to show, that in <hi>England,</hi> the
Kings <pb n="142" facs="tcp:104314:90"/> have allwayes assumed a Supremacy in Ecclesiastical
matters.<note place="margin">1534.</note> They began with the most Ancient
Writing that relates to the Christian Religion in <hi>England</hi> then extant,
Pope <hi>Elentherius</hi> Letter to King <hi>Lucius,</hi> in which he is twice
called by him <hi>Gods Vicar in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and he writ in it, <hi>that
it belong'd to his Office, to bring his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Holy Church,</hi> and
to maintain, protect, and govern them in it. Many Laws were cited, which
<hi>Canutus, Ethelred, Edgar, Edmond, Athelstan</hi> and <hi>Ina</hi> had
Enacted concerning Church-men, many more Laws since the Conquest were also
made, both against appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and Bishops going out of the
Kingdom without the Kings leave.</p>
            </q>
            <p> The whole business of the Articles of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and the
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests that followed between King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d, and <hi>Thomas
Becket</hi> were also opened. And though a Bishops Pastoral care be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Institution, yet as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had divided Bishopricks as
they pleased, so they also converted Benefices from the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the
Founders, and gave them to Cloisters and Monasteries as King <hi>Edgar</hi>
did; all which was done by the Consent of their Clergy and Nobility, without
dependance on <hi>Rome</hi>; They had also granted these Houses Exemption from
Episcopal Jurisdiction, so <hi>Ina</hi> exempted <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> and
<hi>Offa,</hi> St. <hi>Albans,</hi> from their Bishops visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: and this
continued even till the dayes of <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, for he to
perpetuate the Memory of the Victory he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over <hi>Harald,</hi> and to
endear himself to the Clergy, founded an Abbey in the Field where the Battel
was fought, and called it <hi>Battel-Abbey,</hi> and in the Charter he granted
them, these words are to be found. <hi>It shall be also free and quiet for
ever, from all subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Bishops, or the Dominion of any other persons, as
Christs Church in</hi> Canterbury <hi>is.</hi> Many other things were brought
out of King <hi>Alfreds</hi> Laws, and a speech of King <hi>Edgars,</hi> with
several Letters written to the Popes from the Kings, the Parliaments, and the
Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>England,</hi> to show, that their Kings did always make Laws
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Sacred matters, and that their Power reach't to that, and to the persons
of Church-men, as well as to their other Subjects.</p>

at the same time that they pleaded so much for the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and Power
of making Laws for restraining and Coercing his Subjects, it appeared that they
were far from vesting him with such an absolute Power, as the Popes had

be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the same. And finally to oversee and cause that the said
Bishops and Priests do execute their pastoral office truly and faithfully, and
spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in these points, which by Christ and his Apostles was given and
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them; and in case they shall be negligent in any part thereof, or
would not diligently execute the same, to cause them to redouble and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their lack: and if they obstinately withstand their Princes kind moniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and
will not amend their faults, then and in such case to put others in their rooms
and places. And God hath also commanded the said Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <pb n="143" facs="tcp:104314:90"/>
and Priests to obey with all humbleness and Reverence, both Kings, and Princes,
and Governors, and all their Laws; not being contrary to the Laws of God,
whatsoever they be: and that not only</hi> propter Iram <hi>but also</hi>
propter Conscientiam, <hi>that is to say, not only for fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, but
also for Discharge of Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that they both limited obedience to the Kings
Laws, with the due Caution of their not being contrary to the Law of God, and
acknowledged the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Pastoral
Office, committed to the Pastors of the Church by Christ and his Apostles; and
that the Supremacy then pretended to, was no such Extravagant Power as some
imagine.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>Upon the whole matter, it was Concluded, that the Popes Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
  in <hi>England</hi> had no good Foundation,<note place="margin">The necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of
 extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Popes Power.</note> and had been managed with as much Tyranny,
  as it had begun with Usurpation, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of their Courts were
  every-where heavy, but in no place so intolerable as in <hi>England</hi>: and
  though many complaints were made of them in these last 300 years, yet they got
  no ease, and all the Laws about Provisors were still defeated and made
  ineffectual; Therefore they saw it was impossible to moderate their
  proceedings; so that there was no other Remedy, but to extirpate their
  pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Authority, and thenceforth to acknowledge the Pope only Bishop of
  <hi>Rome,</hi> with the jurisdiction about it, defined by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Canons:
  and for the King to re-assume his own Authority, and the Prerogatives of his
  Crown, from which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had never formally departed,
  though they had for this last Hundred years connived at an Invasion and
  Usurpation upon them, which was no longer to be endured.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These were the Grounds of casting off the Pope's Power, that had
been for two or three years studied,<note place="margin">Pains taken to satisfie
  <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher</hi> about it.</note> and enquired into by all the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in
<hi>England</hi>; and had been debated both in Convocation and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and
except <hi>Fisher</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> I do not find that any
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop appeared for the Popes Power; and for the Abbots and Priors, as they
were generally very ignorant, so what the Cardinal had done in suppressing some
Monasteries, and what they now heard, that the Court had an eye on their Lands,
made them to be as complyant as could be. But <hi>Fisher</hi> was a man of
great reputation, and very ancient, so that much pains was taken to satisfie
him. A week before the Parliament sat down, the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> proposed to him, that he and any Five Doctors, such as he
should choose, and the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and Five Doctors with him
might confer about it, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Authorities of both sides, that so
there might be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement among them, by which the scandal might be removed,
which otherwise would be taken from their Janglings and Contests a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves. <hi>Fisher</hi> accepted of this, and <hi>Stokesley</hi> wrote to
him on the 8th of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> that he was ready whenever the other
pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and desired him to name time and place,<note place="margin">The
  Origi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they could not agree the matter among themselves, he moved to refer it to two
Learned men whom they should choose, in whose determination they would both
acquiesce. How far this overture went, I cannot discover, and perhaps
<hi>Fishers</hi> sickness hindred the progress of it. But now on the 15th of
<hi>Ianuary,</hi> the Parliament sat down: by the Journals I find 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104314:91"/> no other Bishops present but the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>London, Winchester, Lincoln, Bath</hi>
and <hi>Wells, Landaffe</hi> and <hi>Carlisle.</hi> There were also twelve
Abbots present, but upon what pretences the rest excused their attendance, I do
not know; perhaps some made a difference between submitting to what was done,
and being active and concurring to make the change. During the Session a Bishop
preached every Sunday at <hi>Pauls</hi>-Cross, and declared to the people, That
the Pope had no Authority at all in <hi>England.</hi> In the two former
Sessions the Bishops had preached, that the general Council was above the Pope,
but now they struck a note higher. This was done to let the people see, what
justice and reason was in the Acts that were then pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, to which I now
turn, and shall next give an account of this great Session of Parliament, which
I shall put rather in the natural Method ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the matter of the Acts,
than in the order of time as they passed.</p>
            <p>On the 9th of <hi>March</hi> a Bill came up from the Commons for
discharge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subjects of all dependance on the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> it
was read the first time in the House of Lords the 13th of <hi>March,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Journal, Procer.</note> and on the 14th was read the second time,
and Committed. The Committee reported it on the 19th, by which it appears there
was no stiff nor long opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he that was likest to make it, was both
obnoxious and absent, as will afterwards appear. On the 19th it was read the
third time, and on the 20th the fourth time, and then passed without any
protestation. Some Proviso's were added to it by the Lords, to which the
Commons agreed, and so it was made ready for the Royal assent.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>In the Preamble the intolerable exactions for
  <hi>Peter</hi>-pence, Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Pensions, and Bulls of all sorts are
  complained of, which were contrary to all Laws,<note place="margin">The Act for
 taking away the Popes Power.</note> and grounded only on the Popes Power of
  Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing, which was Usurped. But the King and the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons within
  his own Realm had only power to consider, how any of the Laws were to be
  Dispensed with or Abrogated; and since the King was acknowledged the Supreme
  Head of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by the Prelates and Clergy,<note place="margin">It is the Act 21 in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Book, 27 in the Record, and 8 in
 the Journal.</note> in their Convocations, Therefore it was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted that all
  Payments made to the Apostolick Chamber, and all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, Bulls, or
  Dispensations should from thenceforth cease. But that all Dispensations or
  Licences for things that were not contrary to the Law of God, but only to the
  Law of the Land, should be granted within the Kingdom, by, and under the Seals
  of the two Arch-Bishops in their several Provinces; who should not presume to
  grant any contrary to the Laws of Almighty God, and should only grant such
  Licences as had been formerly in use to be granted, but give no Licence for any
  new thing till it were first examined by the King and his Council whether such
  things might be dispensed with; and that all Dispensations which were formerly
  taxed at, or above 4 <hi>l.</hi> should be also confirmed under the Great-Seal.
  Then many clauses follow about the Rates of Licences and the ways of procuring
  them. It was also declared, that they did not hereby intend to vary from
  Christ's Church about the Articles of the Catholick Faith of Christendom, or in
  any other things declared by the Scriptures, and the word of God necessary for
  their Salvation; confirming withal the exemptions of Monasteries formerly
  granted by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> exempting them still from the
  Arch-Bishops Visitations; declaring that such Abbeys <pb n="145" facs="tcp:104314:91"/>
  whose Elections were formerly confirmed by the Pope, shall be now confirmed by
  the King; who likewise shall give Commission under his Great-Seal for visiting
  them, providing also that Licences and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writs obtained from <hi>Rome</hi>
  before the 12 of <hi>March</hi> in that year should be valid and in force,
  except they were contrary to the Laws of the Realm; giving also to the King and
  his Council power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and reform all Indulgences and Priviledges (or the
  abuses of them) which had been granted by the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> The
  offenders against this Act were to be punished according to the Statutes of
  <hi>Provisors</hi> and <hi>Premunire.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Act, as it gave great ease to the Subject,<note place="margin">The judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments past on that Act.</note> so it cut off that base
trade of Indulgences about Divine Laws, which had been so gainful to the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> but was of late fatal to it. All in the Religious Houses saw
their Priviledges now struck at, since they were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as the King
saw cause, which put them in no small confusion. Those that favoured the
Reformation rejoyced at this Act, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Popes Power was rooted
out, but because the Faith that was to be adhered to, was to be taken from
those things, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures declared necessary to Salvation; so that
all their fears were now much qualified, since the Scripture was to be the
standard of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith. On the same day that this Bill passed in the
House of Lords, another Bill was read for confirming the Succession to the
Crown in the Issue of the Kings present Marriage with Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> It
was read the second time on the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> and Committed. It was
reported on the 23th, and read the third time and passed, and sent down to the
Commons, who sent it back again to them on the 26th, so speedily did this Bill
go through both Houses without any opposition.</p>
            <p>The Preamble of it was,<note place="margin">Act about the Succession
  to the Crown, 22 in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Books, 34 in the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>The distractions that had been in <hi>England</hi> about the
  Succession to the Crown, which had occasioned the effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of much Blood, with
  many other mischiefs, all which flowed from the want of a clear Decision of the
  true Title, from which the Popes had Usurped a Power of investing such as
  pleased them in other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Kingdoms, and Princes had often maintained such
  Donations for their other ends; therefore to avoid the like inconveniences, the
  Kings former Marriage with the Princess <hi>Katharine,</hi> is judged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
  to the Laws of God, and void and of no effect, and the Sentence passed by the
  Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> annulling it, is confirmed, and the Lady
  <hi>Katharine</hi> is thenceforth to be reputed only Princess Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager and not
  Queen, and the Marriage with Queen <hi>Ann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> is establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and confirmed: and Marriages
  within the degrees Prohibited by <hi>Moses</hi> (which are enumerated in the
  Statute) are declared to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, according to the judgment of the
  Convocations of this Realm, and of the most famous Universities and Learned men
  abroad, any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations to the contrary notwithstanding, which are also
  declared null, since contrary to the Laws of God; and all that were Married
  within these degrees are appointed to be Divorced, and the Children begotten in
  such Marriages were declared Illegitimate: And all the Issue that should be
  between the King and the present Queen is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Lawful, and the Crown was
  to descend on his Issue Male by her, or any other Wife; or in default of Issue
  Male, to the Issue Female by the Queen; and in default of any such, to the
  right Heirs of the <pb n="146" facs="tcp:104314:92"/> Kings Highness for ever: and any that
  after the 1st of <hi>May</hi> should ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously divulge any thing to the
  slander of the Kings Marriage, or of the Issue begotten in it, were to be
  adjudged for misprision of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and to suffer Imprisonment at the Kings
  will, and forfeit all their Goods and Chattels to him: And if the Queen
  out-lived the King, she is declared Regent till the Issue by her were of Age,
  if a Son 18, and if a Daughter 16 years of Age; and all the Kings Subjects were
  to Swear that they would maintain the Contents of this Act, and whoever being
  required, did refuse it, was to be judged guilty of misprision of Treason, and
  punished accordingly.</q> The Oath it seems was likewise agreed on in the House
of Lords, for the Form of it is set down in their Journal as follows.</p>
            <p>

  said Soveraign Lord according to the limitation in the Statute made for surety
  of his Succession in the Crown of this Realm mentioned and contained, and not
  to any other within this Realm, nor Forreign Authority or Potentate. And in
  case any Oath be made, or hath been made, by you to any Person or Persons, that

  the whole Effects and Contents thereof, and all other Acts and Statutes made in
  Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for Execution of the same, or of any thing therein contained.

            </p>
            <p>And thus was the Kings Marriage confirmed. But when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
returned this Bill to the Lords, they sent them another with it, concerning the
proceedings against Hereticks. There had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints made formerly, as was
told before, of the severe and intolerable proceedings in the Ecclesiastical
Courts against Hereticks: And on the 4th of <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bruary,</hi> the Commons sent up a complaint made by one
<hi>Thomas Philips</hi> against the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> for using him
cruelly in Prison, upon the suspition of Heresie; but the Lords doing nothing
in it, on the 1st of <hi>March</hi> the House of Commons sent some of their
number to the Bishop, requiring him to make answer to the complaints exhibited
against him,<note place="margin">Journal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</note> who acquainted the House
of Lords with it the next day: but as they had formerly laid aside the
complaint as not worthy of their time, so they all with one consent answered,
That it was not fit for any of the Peers to appear or answer at the Barr of the
House of Commons. Upon this the House of Commons finding they could do nothing
in that particular case, resolved to provide an effectual remedy for such
abuses for the future: And therefore sent up a Bill about the punishment of
Hereticks, which was read that day for the first time, and the second and third
time on the 27th and 28th, in which it passed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:104314:92"/> 
               <q>The Act was a repeal of the Statute of the 2d. of <hi>Henry</hi>
  the 4th, by which Bishops upon suspition of Heresie might commit any to Prison,
  <hi>as was before told,</hi> but in that Act there was no Declaration
  made,<note place="margin">Act about punishing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, 14 in the St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

 Journal:</note> what was Heresie, except in the general words of what was
  contrary to Scriptures, or <hi>Canonical Sanctions.</hi> This was liable to
  great Ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, by which men were in much danger, and not sufficiently
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed what was Heresie. They also complained of their proceedings without
  Presentment or Accusation, contrary to what was practised in all other cases,
  even of Treason it self; and many <hi>Canonical Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> had been
  established only by Popes without any Divine Precept, therefore they repealed
  the Act of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, but left the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of <hi>Richard</hi>
  the 2d, and <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th still in force, with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
  Regulation: That Hereticks should be proceeded against upon Presentments, by
  two Witnesses at least, and then be Committed, but brought to answer to their
  Enditements in open Court; and if they were found guilty, and would not abjure,
  or were relapse, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to death; the Kings Writ <hi>De Haeretico
  comburendo</hi> being first obtained. It was also declared, that none should be
  troubled upon any of the Popes Canons or Laws, or for speaking or doing against
  them. It was likewise provided that men Committed for Heresie might be
  Bailed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It may easily be imagined how acceptable this Act was to the whole
Nation, since it was such an effectual limitation of the Ecclesiastical Power,
in one of the uneasiest parts of it; and this Regulation of the Arbitrary
proceedings of the Spiritual Courts, was a particular blessing to all that
favoured Reformation. But as the Parliament was going on with these good Laws,
there came a Submission from the Clergy then sitting in Convocation, to be
passed in Parliament. With what opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it went through the two Houses of
Convocation, and the House of Commons, is not known; for as the Registers of
the Convocation are burnt, so it does not appear that there were any Journals
kept in the House of Commons at that time. On the 27th of <hi>March</hi> it was
sent up to the Lords, and since the Spiritual Lords had already consented to
it, there was no reason to apprehend any opposition from the Temporal Lords.
The Session was now near an end, so they made haste and read it twice that day,
and the third time the next day, and passed it. The Contents of it were: 
<q>The Clergy acknowledged that all Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had been and
  ought to be assembled by the Kings Writ; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>in verbo
  Sacerdotii,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made by the Clergy to the
 King, 19 in the Statute Book, 25 in the Record.</note> that they would never
  make nor execute any new Canons or Constitutions, without the Royal assent to
  them; and since many Canons had been received that were found prejudicial to
  the Kings Prerogative, contrary to the Laws of the Land, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to the
  Subjects, That therefore there should be a Committee of thirty two Persons,
  sixteen of the two Houses of Parliament, and as many of the Clergy to be named
  by the King, who should have full power to abrogate or confirm Canons as they
  found it expedient; the Kings assent being obtained. This was confirmed by Act
  of Parliament, and by the same Act all appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> were again
  condemned. If any party found themselves agrieved in the Arch-Bishops Courts,
  an appeal might be made to the King in the Court of Chancery; and the
  Lord-Chancellor was to grant a Commission under the Great-Seal 
  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:104314:93"/> for some Delegates, in whose determination all must
  acquiesce. All exempted Abbots were also to appeal to the King; and it
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a Proviso, that till such Correction of the Canons was made,
  all those which were then received should still remain in force, except such as
  were contrary to the Laws and Customs of the Realms, or were to the damage or
  hurt of the Kings Prerogative.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Proviso seemed to have a fair colour, that there might still
be some Canons in force to govern the Church by; but since there was no day
prefixed to the Determination of the Commission, this Proviso made that the Act
never took effect; for now it lay in the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and in the Judges
breast, to declare what Canons were contrary to the Laws, or the Rights of the
Crown: and it was judged more for the Kings Greatness to keep the matter
undetermined, than to make such a Collection of Ecclesiastical Laws as should
be fixed and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The last of the publick Acts of this Session that
related to the Church, was about the Election and Consecration of Bishops. On
the 4th of <hi>February</hi> the Commons sent up a Bill to the Lords about the
Consecration of Bishops;<note place="margin">Journal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>February,</hi> and was then cast out, and a new one drawn. On what reason
it was cast out, is not mentioned, and the Journal does not so much as say that
it was once read. The new Bill had its second reading the 3d of <hi>March,</hi>
and on the 5th it was ordered to be Engross'd; and on the 9th it was read the
third time, and agreed to, and sent down to the Commons, who returned it to the
Lords on the 16th of <hi>March.</hi> 
               <q>The first part of it is a confirmation of their former Act
  against <hi>Annates,</hi> to which they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that Bishops should not be any

  after these were delivered, an Election was to be returned by the Dean and

  to swear Fealty to the King, upon which a Commission was to be issued out, for

  to do Homage to the King, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored both to the Spiritualities and

               </q> There passed a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Act for depriving
the Bishops of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> who were Cardinal
<hi>Campegio</hi> and <hi>Ierome de Ghinuccii</hi>; the former deserved
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter severities at the Kings hand, but the latter seems to have served him
faithfully, and was recommended both by the King and the <hi>French</hi> King
about a year before to a Cardinals Hat. 
<q>The Preamble of the Act bears, that persons promoted to
  Ecclesiastical Benefices ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side within the Kingdom for preaching the
  Laws of Almighty God, and for keeping Hospitality; and since these Prelates did
  not that, but lived at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and neglected their
  Diocesses, and made the Revenues of them be carried out of the Kingdoms,
  contrary to the <pb n="149" facs="tcp:104314:93"/> intentions of the Founders, and to the
  prejudice of the Realm, 3000 <hi>l.</hi> being at least carried yearly out of
  the Kingdom; therefore their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses were declared vacant.</q>

            <p>But now I come to the Act of the Attainder of <hi>Elizabeth

upon this quarrel; and from it one will clearly see, the <hi>Genius</hi> of

Witnesses and other Evidences were brought before them, but chiefly she with
all her Complices, who confessed the Crimes charged on her. It was reported and
read the 6th of <hi>March</hi> the third time, and then the Lords addressed to
the King to know his pleasure, whether Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> and others
mentioned in the Act as <hi>Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or at least <hi>Concealers,</hi>
might not be heard to speak for themselves in the Star-Chamber: As for the
Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> he was sick, but he had written to the House all
that he had to say for his own excuse. What presumptions lay against Sir
<hi>Thomas More,</hi> I have not been able to find out, only that he wrote a
Letter to the Nun, at which the King took great exceptions; yet it appears he
had a mean opinion of her,<note place="margin">See his Works, pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1435.</note> for in discourse
with his beloved Daughter Mistress <hi>Roper,</hi> he called her commonly the
silly Nun. But for justifying himself, he wrote a full account of all the
entercourse he had with the Nun and her Complices to <hi>Cromwell</hi>; but tho
by his other printed Letters, both to <hi>Cromwell</hi> and the King, it seems
some ill impressions remained in the Kings mind about it, he still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to justifie not only his intentions, but his actions in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. One
thing is not unworthy of observation, that <hi>Rastall,</hi> who published his
Works in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, printed the second Letter he wrote to
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> yet did not publish that account which he sent first to him
concerning it, to which <hi>More</hi> refers himself in all his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Letters; though it is more like a Copy of that would have been preserved, than
of those other Letters that refer to it. But perhaps it was kept up on design;
for in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time they had a mind to magnifie that story of the
Nuns, since she was thought to have suffered on her Mothers account: and among
the other things she talked, one was that the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> should one day
Reign in <hi>England,</hi> for which <hi>Sanders</hi> has since thought fit to
make a Prophetess of her. And it is certain, <hi>More</hi> had a low opinion of
her, which appears in many places of his printed Letters; but that would have
been much plainer, if that full account he wrote of that Affair had been
published; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that one of their Martyrs might not lessen the esteem
of another, it was fit to suppress it. Whether my conjectures in this be well
grounded, or not, is left to the Readers judgment. In conclusion,
<hi>More</hi>'s justifications seconded with the good Offices that the Lord
Chancellour <hi>Audley,</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> did him, (who as appears by
his Leters stood his Friends in that matter) did so work on the King, that his
name was put out of the Bill, and so the Act was agreed on by both Houses, and
the Royal assent followed. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was this, 
<q>
                  <hi>Elizabeth Barton</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the Parish of
  <hi>Aldington,</hi> being sick and distempered in her brain, fell in some
  Trances, (it <pb n="150" facs="tcp:104314:94"/> seems by the Symptoms they were Hysterical
  fits) and spoke many words that made great impressions on some about her, who
  thought her Inspired of God, and <hi>Richard Master,</hi> Parson of the Parish,
  hoping to draw great advantages from this, went to <hi>Warham</hi> Arch-Bishop
  of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and gave him a large account of her Speeches, who
  ordered him to attend her carefully, and bring him a further report of any new
  Trances, she might afterwards fall in. But she had forgot all she had said in
  her fits, yet the crafty Priest would not let it go so, but perswaded her, that
  what she had said, was by the Inspiration of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and that
  she ought to own that it was so. Upon which he taught her to counterfeit such
  traunces, and to utter such speeches as she had done before; so that after a
  whiles Practice, she became very ready at it. The thing was much noised abroad,
  and many came to see her, but the Priest had a mind to raise the reputation of
  an Image of the Blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> that was in a Chappel within his
  Parish, that so Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges being made to it, he might draw these advantages
  from it, that others made from their famed Images, but chose for his Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
  one Doctor <hi>Bocking,</hi> a Canon of Christ-Church in <hi>Canterbury</hi>:
  Upon which they instructed her to say in her Counterfeited traun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the
  Blessed Virgin had appeared to her, and told her she could never recover, till
  she went and visited her Image in that Chappel. They had also taught her in her
  fits to make strange motions with her body, by which she was much diffigured,
  and to speak many Godly words against Sin, and the new Doctrines, which were
  called Heresies, as also against the Kings suit of Divorce. It was also noised
  abroad, on what day she intended to go and visit the Image of the Virgin, so
  that about 2000 people were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and she being brought to the
  Chappel, fell into her fits and made many strange Grimaces and alterations of
  her body, and spake many words of great piety, saying, that by the Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
  of God, she was called to be a Religious Woman, and that <hi>Bocking</hi> was
  to be her Ghostly Father. And within a little while she seemed by the
  intercession of our Lady, to be perfectly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her former distempers,
  and she afterwards professed a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life. There were also violent
  suspitions of her incontinency, and that <hi>Bocking</hi> was a Carnal, as well
  as a Spiritual Father. She fell in many raptures, and pretended she saw strange
  Visions, heard Heavenly Melody, and had the Revelation of many things that were
  to come, so that great credit was given to what she said, and people generally
  looked on her as a Prophetess, and among those the late Arch-Bishop of
  <hi>Canterbury</hi> was led away with the rest. A Book was writ of her
  Revelations and Prophecies by one <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> another Monk, who was taken
  in to the Conspiracy with many others. It was also given out that <hi>Mary
  Magdalen</hi> gave her a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was writ in Heaven, which was shewed to
  many, being all writ in Golden Letters. She pretended when the King was last at
  <hi>Calais,</hi> that he being at Mass, an Angel brought away the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
  and gave it to her, being then invisibly present, and that she was presently
  brought over the Sea to her Monastery again. But the design of all these
  traunces was to alienate the people from their <pb n="151" facs="tcp:104314:94"/> duty to
  the King, for the Maid gave it out, that God revealed to her, that if the King
  went on in the Divorce and Marryed another Wife, <hi>he should not be King a
  Month longer, and in the reputation of Almighty God not one howr longer, but
  should die a villains Death.</hi> This, she said was revealed to her in answer
  to the prayers she had put up to God, to know whether he approved of the Kings
  proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or not? Which coming to the knowledg of the Bishop of
  <hi>Rochester</hi> and some others, who adhered to the Queens interests, they
  had frequent meetings with the Maid, and concealed what she spake concerning
  the King, and some of them gave such credit to what she said, that they
  practised on many others to draw them from their allegeance, and prevailed with
  several of the Fathers and Nuns of <hi>Sion,</hi> of the <hi>Charter-House</hi>
  in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Shene,</hi> and of the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>Richmont,

Concluded, <hi>that it was the greatest misery of Princes, to be daily so
abused by flatterers as they were.</hi> The King bore it patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and
expressed no signs of any commotion, but to undeceive the people, he took care
that Doctor <hi>Corren</hi> or <hi>Carwin</hi> should preach next Sunday, who
justified the Kings proceedings, and condemned <hi>Peto</hi> as a Rebel, a
Slanderer, a Dog, and a Traytor. <hi>Peto</hi> was gone to
<hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> but another observant Frier of the same House,
<hi>Elston</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him: and said he was one of the lying Prophets,
that sought by Adultery to establish the Succession to the Crown, and that he
would justifie all that <hi>Peto</hi> had said, and speak many other things
with great vehemency, nor could they silence him, till the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
commanded him to hold his peace. And yet all that was done either to him, or
<hi>Peto,</hi> was, that being called before the Privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, they were
rebuked for their insolence, by which it appears, that King <hi>Henry</hi> was
not very easily inflamed against them, when a crime of so high a Nature was so
slightly passed over.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>Nor was this all, but the Fathers that were in the Conspiracy,
  had confederated to publish these Revelations in their Sermons, up and down the
  Kingdom. They had also given Notice of them to the Popes Ambassadors, and had
  brought the Maid to declare her Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to them, they had also sent an
  account to Queen <hi>Katharine</hi> for encouraging her to stand out and not
  submit to the Laws, of which Confederacy <hi>Thomas Abel</hi> was likewise
  one.</q> The thing that was in so many hands could not be a secret,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Stow.</hi>
               </note> therefore the King who had despised it long,
ordered that in <hi>Nouember</hi> the former year the Maid and her Complices,
<hi>Richard Master,</hi> Doctor <hi>Bocking, Richard Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Henry Gold,</hi>
a Parson in <hi>London, Hugh Rich</hi> an observant Frier, <hi>Richard Risby,
Thomas Gold</hi> and <hi>Edward Twaites</hi> Gentlemen, and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Laurence</hi> should be brought into the Star-Chamber, where there was a great
appearance of many Lords, they were examined upon <pb n="152" facs="tcp:104314:95"/> the
premises, and did all without any rack or torture confess the whole Conspiracy,
and were adjudged to stand in <hi>Pauls</hi> all the Sermon time; and after
Sermon, the Kings Officers were to give every one of them his Bill of
Confession to be openly read before the people, which was done next Sunday, the
Bishop of <hi>Bangor</hi> preaching, they being all set in a Scaffold before
him. This publick manner was thought upon good grounds, to be the best way to
satisfie the people of the Imposture of the whole matter, and it did very much
convince them, that the cause must needs be bad, where such methods were used
to support it. From thence they were carryed to the Tower, where they lay till
the Session of Parliament, but when they lay there, some of their Complices
sent messages to the Nun, to encourage her to deny all that she had said; and
it is very probable, that the reports that went abroad of her being forced or
cheated into a Confession, made the King think it necessary to proceed more
severely against her. The thing being considered in Parliament, it was judged a
Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy against the Kings Life and Crown. So the <hi>Nun</hi> and
<hi>Master, Bock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Deering, Rich, Risby</hi> and <hi>Henry Gold</hi> were
Attainted of high Treason. And the Bishop of <hi>Rochester, Thomas Gold, Thomas
Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Edward Twaites, Iohn Adeson,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Abell,</hi> were
judged guilty of misprision of Treason, and to forfeit their goods and Chattels
to the King, and to be imprisoned during his pleasure, and all the Books that
were written of her Revelations, were ordered to be sent in, to some of the
chief Officers of State, under the pains of Fine and Imprisonment. It had been
also found, that the Letter which she pretended to have got from <hi>Mary
Magdalen e,</hi> was written by one <hi>Hankherst</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
and that the door of the <hi>Dormitorie,</hi> which was given out to be made
open by miracle, that she might go into the Chappel for Converse with God, was
opened by some of her Complices, for beastly and carnal ends. But in the
Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Act, all others who had been corrupted in their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
by these impostures, except the persons before named, were at the earnest
intercession of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> pardoned.</p>
            <p>The two Houses of Parliament (having ended their business) were
prorogued on the 29th of <hi>March,</hi> to the 3d of <hi>November,</hi> and
before they broke up, all the Members of both Houses, that they might give a
good example to the Kings other Subjects, swore the Oath of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, as
appears from the Act made about it in the next Session of Parliament. The
Execution of these persons was delayed for some time, it is like, till the King
had a return from <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger he had sent thither with his
Submission.</p>
            <p>Soon after that, on the 20 of <hi>April,</hi> the <hi>Nun</hi> and
<hi>Bocking, Master, Deering, Risby</hi> and <hi>Gold (Rich</hi> is not named
being perhaps either dead or pardoned) were brought to <hi>Tiburn.</hi> The
<hi>Nun</hi> spake these words. <hi>Hither I am come to die, and I have not
been only the cause of mine own death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Nuns</hi>
  speech at her death.</note> 
               <hi>which most justly I have deserved, but also I
am the cause of the death of all those persons, which at this time here suffer.
And yet to say the truth, I am not so much to be blamed, considering that it
was well known to these learned men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that I was a poor wench without
Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore they might easily have perceived, that the things that
were done by me, could not proceed in no such sort; but their capacities 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104314:95"/> and Learning could right well judge, from whence they
proceeded, and that they were altogether feigned; but because the thing which I
feigned was profitable to them, therefore they much praised me, and bore me in
hand, that it was the Holy-Ghost and not I, that did them; and then I being
pussed up with their praises, fell into a certain pride and foolish fantasie
with my self, and thought I might feign what I would, which thing hath brought
me to this case: and for the which now, I cry God and the Kings Highness most
heartily Mercy, and desire you, all good people, to pray to God to have mercy
on me, and on all them that here suffer with me,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On all this I have dwelt the longer, both because these are all
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Martyrs by <hi>Sanders,</hi> and that this did first provoke the King
against the Regular Clergy, and drew after it all the severities that were done
in the rest of his Reign. The foulness and the wicked designs of this
Imposture, did much alienate people from the Interest of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
made the other Acts both pass more easily, and be better receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the
people. It was also generally believed, that what was now discovered was no new
practice, but that many of the Visions and Miracles, by which Religious Orders
had raised their Credit so high, were of the same Nature: and it made way for
the destroying of all the Monasteries in <hi>England,</hi> though all the
severity which at this time followed on it, was that the <hi>Observant</hi>
Friers of <hi>Richmont,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

out of their Houses, and put with the other <hi>Gray-Friers,</hi> and
<hi>Augustin-Friers</hi> were put in their Houses.</p>
            <p>But because of the great name of <hi>Fisher</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Rochester,</hi> and since this was the first step to his ruin, it is
necessary to give a fuller account of his carriage in this matter. When the
cheat was first discovered, <hi>Cromwell</hi> then Secretary of State,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fisher</hi> gently dealt with.</note> sent the Bishops Brother
to him, with a sharp reproof for his carriage in that business; but withal
advised him to write to the <hi>King,</hi> and acknowledge his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and
desire his pardon, which he knew the <hi>King,</hi> considering his Age and
sickness, would grant. But he wrote back, excusing himself, that all he did,
was only to try, whether her Revelations were true? He confessed,<note place="margin">But is obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable.</note> he conceived a great
opinion of her Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, both from common Fame, and her entring into Religion;
from the report of her Ghostly Father, whom he esteemed Learned and Religious,
and of many other Learned and Vertuous Priests; from the good opinion the late
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had of her, and from what is in the Prophet
<hi>Amos, That God will do nothing without revealing it to his Servants.</hi>
That upon these grounds, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to have a good opinion of her; and
that to try the truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, he had sometimes spoken with her, and sent
his Chaplains to her, but never discovered any falsehood in her. And for his
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing what she had told him about the King, which was laid to his charge,
he thought it needless for him to speak of it to the King, since she had said
to him, that she had told it to the King her self: She had named no person who
should kill the King, which by being known, might have been prevented. And as
in Spiritual things, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church-man was not bound to denounce judgments
against those that could not bear it; so in temporal things, the case might be
the same; and the King had on other occasions spoken so sharply to him, 
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104314:96"/> that he had reason to think, the King would have been
offended with him for speaking of it, and would have suspected that he had a
hand in it; therefore he desired for the passion of Christ to be no more
troubled about that matter, otherwise he would speak his Conscience freely. To
all which, <hi>Cromwell</hi> wrote a long Letter, which the Reader will find in
the Collection,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 49. <hi>Cott.</hi>

which he charges the Matter upon him heavily, and shews him, that he had not
proceeded, as a grave <hi>Prelate</hi> ought to have done; for he had taken all
that he had heard of her upon trust, and had examined nothing; that if every
person that pretends to Revelations were believed on their own words, all
Government would be thereby destroyed. He had no reason to conclude from the
Prophecie of <hi>Amos,</hi> that every thing that is to fall out, must be
revealed to some Prophet, since many notable things had fallen out, of which
there was no Revelation made before hand. But he told him the true reason that
made him give credit to her, was, the matter of her Prophecies: to which he was
so addicted, as he was to every other thing in which he once entred, that
nothing could come amiss that served to that end. And he appealed to his
Conscience, whether if she had prophecied for the King, he would have given
such easie credit to her, and not have examined the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter further. Then he
showes how guilty he was, in not revealing what concerned the Kings Life, and
how frivolous all his excuses were. And after all, tells him, that though his
excusing the matter had provoked the King, and that if it came to a Tryal, he
would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be found guilty; yet again he advises him to beg the Kings
pardon for his Negligence, and offence in that matter; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes that the
King would receive him into his favour, and that all matters of displeasure
pass'd before that time, should be forgiven and forgotten. This shows that
though <hi>Fisher</hi> had in the progress of the Kings cause, given him great
offence, yet he was ready to pass it all over, and not to take the advantage,
which he now had against him. But <hi>Fisher</hi> was still obstinate and made
no submission, and so was included within the Act for misprision of Treason;
and yet I do not find, that the King proceeded against him upon this Act, till
by new provocations he drew a heavier storm of indignation upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>

               </note> to offer the Oath of
the Succession to the Crown, to all, according to the Act of Parliament, which
was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally taken by all sorts of persons. <hi>Gardiner</hi> wrote from
<hi>Winchester</hi> the 6th of <hi>May</hi> to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that in the
presence of the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, the Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> and many other
Gentlemen, all Abbots, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Wardens, with the Curates of all Parishes and
Chappels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Shire, had appeared and taken the Oath very obediently;
and had given in a list of all the Religious persons in their Houses of 14
years of Age and above, for taking whose Oaths some Commissioners were
appointed. The forms in which they took the Oath are not known, and it is no
wonder, for though they were enrolled, yet in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time there
was a Commission given to <hi>Bonner</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to examine the Records
and raze out of them all things, that <pb n="155" facs="tcp:104314:96"/> were done either in
contempt of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to the defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religious
Houses, pursuant to which, there are many things taken out of the Rolls, which
I shall sometimes have occasion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to take notice of; yet some
Writings have escaped their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, so there remains but two of the
Subscriptions of Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, both bearing date the 4th of <hi>May</hi>
1534. One is by the Prior and Convent of <hi>Langley Regis,</hi> that were
Dominicans, the Franciscans of <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> the Dominicans of
<hi>Dunstable,</hi> the Franciscans of <hi>Bedford,</hi> the Carmelites of

                  <hi>More</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher</hi> refuse
  the Oath.</note> refused to take the Oath as it was conceived: Whose Fall being
so remarkable, I shall shew the steps of it. There was a meeting of the Privy
Council at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> to which many were cited to appear, and take the
Oath.<note place="margin">See his works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 1428.</note> Sr. <hi>Thomas
More</hi> was first called, and the Oath was tendred to him under the great
Seal, then he called for the Act of Succession, to which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, which was
also shewed him: having considered of them, he said he would neither blame
these that made the Act, nor those that Swore the Oath, but for his part,
though he was willing to Swear to the Succession, if he might be suffered to
draw an Oath concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, yet for the Oath that was offered him, his
Conscience so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, that he could not without hazarding his Soul take it.
Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, the Lord Chancellour told him, that he was the first who had
refused to Swear it, and that the King would be highly offended with him for
denying it, and so he was desired to withdraw and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider better of it.
Several others were called upon, and did all take the Oath, except the Bishop
of <hi>Rochester,</hi> who answered upon the matter as <hi>More</hi> had done.
When the Lords had dispatched all the rest, <hi>More</hi> was again brought
before them: they shewed him how many had taken it, he answered, he judged no
man for doing it, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he could not do it himself. Then they asked the reasons
why he refused it? He answered, he feared it might provoke the King more
against him, if he should offer reasons which would be called a dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
against Law: but when he was further pressed to give his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104314:97"/> he said if the King would command him to do it, he would
put them in Writing.</p>
            <p>The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> urged him with this
Argument, that since he said he blamed no other person for taking it, it seemed
he was not perswaded it was a Sin, but was doubtful in the matter: but he did
certainly know, he ought to obey the King, and the Law, so there was a
certainty on the one hand, and only a doubt on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore he was
obliged to do that about which he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, notwithstanding these his
doubtings. This did shake him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, especially (as himself writes)
<hi>coming out of so Noble a Prelates mouth:</hi> but he answered, that, though
he had examined the matter very carefully, yet his Conscience leaned positively
to the other side; and he offered to purge himself by his Oath, that it was
purely out of a Principle of Conscience, and out of no light Fantasie or
Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy that he thus refused it. The Abbot of <hi>Westminster</hi> pressed
him, that however the matter appeared to him, he might see his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science was
Erroneous, since the great Council of the Realm was of another mind, and
therefore he ought to change his Conscience. (A Reasoning very fit for so rich
an Abbot, which discovers of what temper his Conscience was) But to this
<hi>More</hi> answered, that if he were alone against the whole Parliament, he
had reason to suspect his own understanding; but he thought he had the whole
Council of Christendome on his side, as well as the great Council of
<hi>England</hi> was against him. Secretary <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who (as
<hi>More</hi> writes) <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured him,</hi> seeing his ruin was now
inevitable, was much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at it; and protested with an Oath, he had rather
his own only Son had lost his head, than that he should have refused the Oath.
Thus both he and the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> refused it, but both offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Swear another Oath for the Succession of the Crown to the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue of the
Kings present Marriage, because that was in the Power of the Parliament to
determine it. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who was a moderate and wise man, and foresaw
well the ill effects that would follow on contending so much, with persons so
highly esteemed over the World, and of such a temper, that severity would bend
them to nothing, did by an earnest Letter to <hi>Cromwell</hi> dated the 27th
of <hi>April</hi> move,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Weavers</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, page 504
  and 506.</note> that what they offered might be accepted; for if they once
Swore to the Succession, it would quiet the Kingdom, for they acknowledging it,
all other persons would acquiesce and submit to their Judgments. But this sage
advice was not accepted.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst.</note>The King was
much irritated against them, and resolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with them according to
Law, and therefore they were both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted upon the Statute, and Committed
Prisoners to the Tower. And it being apprehended, that if they had Books and
Paper given them, they would write against the Kings Marriage or his
Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, these were denyed them. The Old <hi>Bishop</hi> was hardly used,
his Bishoprick was seized on, and all his goods taken from him, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some old
rags were left to cover him; and he was neither supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well in diet nor
other necessaries, of which he made sad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to <hi>Cromwell.</hi> But
the remander of this Tragical business, which left one of the greatest blots on
this Kings proceedings, falling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of the next Book, I haste on
to the Conclusion of this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:104314:97"/>The Separation from <hi>Rome</hi> was made in
the former Session of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but the Kings Supremacy was not yet fully
setled. This was reserved for the next Session that sate in <hi>November</hi>
from the 3d of that month, to the 18th of <hi>December,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Another Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> about which we can have no
light from the Journals, they being lost. 
<q>The first Act Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what had been already acknowledged by
  the Clergy,<note place="margin">The Kings Supremacy declared.</note> that the
  King was the Supream Head in Earth, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which
  was to be annexed to his other Titles: it was also enacted that the King and
  his heirs and Successors should have Power to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit and reform all Heresies,
  Errors, and other Abuses, which in the Spiritual jurisdiction, ought to be
  reform'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By the Second Act they Confirmed the Oath about the

                  </gap>med.</note> concerning which some doubts had been made, because
there was no Oath specified in the former Act: though both Houses had taken it:
it was now Enacted, that all the Subjects were obliged to take it when offered
to them, under the pains contained in the Act pass'd in the former Session. By
the Third Act, the first Fruits and Tenths of all Ecclesiastical Benefices were
given to the King,<note place="margin">The first Fruits of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices given to
  the King.</note> as the Supream Head of the Church. The Clergy were easily
prevailed on, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the putting down of the <hi>Annates,</hi> pay'd to
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> for all men readily concur to take off any
Imposition; but at that time it had perhaps abated much of their heartiness, if
they had imagined that these duties should have been still payed, therefore
that was kept up till they had done all that was to be done against
<hi>Rome.</hi> And now as the Commons and the Secular Lords would no doubt
easily agree to lay a taxe on the Clergy, so the others having no forreign
sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, were not in a condition to wrestle against it.</p>
            <p>In the Thirteenth Act,<note place="margin">Sundry things are
  declared Treason.</note> among other things that were made Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, one was
the denying the King the Dignity, Title or name, of his Estate Royal: or the
calling the King Heretick, Schismatick, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Infidel, or Usurper of the
Crown. This was done to restrain the Insolencies of some Friars, and all such
offenders were to be denyed the Priviledge of Sanctuaries. By the Fourteenth
Act,<note place="margin">An Act for Suffragan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</note> provision was made
for Suffragan Bishops, which as is said, <hi>had been accustomed to be had
within this Realm, for the more speedy administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and
other good wholesom and devout things, and laudable ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to the
encrease of Gods honour, and for the commodity of good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout people,</hi>
therefore they appointed for Suffragans Sees, the Towns of <hi>Thetford,
Ipswich, Colechester, Dover, Gilford, Southampton, Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Shaftbury, Malton,
Marleborough, Bedford, Leicester, Glocester, Shrewsbury, Bristol, Penreth,

and <hi>Berwick,</hi> St. <hi>Germans</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and the Isle
of <hi>Wight.</hi> For these Sees the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the Diocess was to present two
to the King, who might choose either of them, and present the person so named,
to the Arch-Bishop of the Province, to be Consecrated; after which, they might
exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise such jurisdiction as the Bishop of the Diocess should give to them,
or as Suffragans had been formerly used to do, but their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was to last
no longer than the Bishop continued his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to them. But that the
Reader may more clearly see how this Act was executed, he shall find in the
Collection,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 51.</note> a Writ for

                  <p>A Subsidy granted.</p>
               </note> and now revived in
<hi>England.</hi> Then followed the grant of a Subsidy to the King: It was now
Twelve years since there was any Subsidy granted. A Fiveteenth and a Tenth were
given, to be payed in Three years, the final payment being to be at
Allhallon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide, in the year 1537. 
<q>The Bill began with a most Glorious Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Kings high
  Wisdom and Policy in the Government of the Kingdom these Twenty Four years in
  great wealth and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the great charges he had been at in the last
  War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> in fortifying <hi>Callais,</hi> and in the War of
  <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he intended to bring the wilful, wild, and
  unreasonable, and savage people of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to Order and Obedience,
  and intended to build Forts on the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the
  security of the Nation, to amend the Haven of <hi>Calais,</hi> and make a new
  one at <hi>Dover.</hi> By all which they did perceive the entire love and zeal
  which the King bore to his People, and that he sought not their wealth and
  quietness, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his own time, being a Mortal man, but did provide for it
  in all time coming, therefore they thought that of very equity, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and
  good Conscience, they were bound to show like corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence of zeal,
  gratitude and kindness.</q> Upon this the King sent a general pardon with some
exceptions, ordinary in such cases. But <hi>Fisher</hi> and <hi>More,</hi> were
not only excluded from this pardon by general Clauses,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>More</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher</hi> attainted. Act. 3. and 4.
  <hi>Rot. Parl.</hi>
               </note> but by two particular Acts they were attainted of
misprision of Treason. By the Third Act according to the Record, <hi>Iohn</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Rochester, Christopher Plummer, Nicholas Wilson, Edward Powel,
Richard Fetherston,</hi> and <hi>Miles Willyr</hi> Clerks, were attainted for
refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Oath of Succession, and the Bishoprick of <hi>Rochester,</hi>
with the Benefices of the other Clerks were declared void from the 2d of
<hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> next, yet it seems few were fond of succeeding him in that
See, for <hi>Iohn Hilsey</hi> the next Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> was not
Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the year 1537. 
<q>By the Fourth Act Sr. <hi>Thomas More</hi> is by an Invidious
  Preamble charged with ingratitude, for the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he had received from
  the King, and for studying to sow and make sedition among the Kings Subjects,
  and refusing to take the Oath of Succession, therefore they declared the Kings
  Grants to him to be void, and attaint him of misprision of Treason.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This severity though it was blamed by many, yet others thought it
was necessary in so great a Change;<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
  them variously cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.</note> since the Authority of these two men was such,
that if some signal notice had not been taken of them, many might by their
endeavors, especially encouraged by that Impunity, have been corrupted in their
affections to the King. Others thought the prosecuting them in such a manner,
did rather raise their reputation higher, and give them more credit with the
people, who are naturally enclined to pity those that suffer, and to think well
of those opinions, for which they see men resolved, to endure all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
But others observed the justice of God, in retaliating thus up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them their
own severities to others, for as <hi>Fisher</hi> did grievously 
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104314:98"/> prosecute the preachers of <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine, so
<hi>Mores</hi> hand had been very heavy on them as long as he had Power, and he
had shewed them no mercy, but the extremity of the Law, which himself now felt
to be very heavy. Thus ended this Session of Parliament, with which this Book
is also to conclude, for now I come to a Third pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the Kings Reign, in
which he did Govern his Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Competitor, but I am to stop a
little, and give an account of the Progress of the Reformation in these years
that I have past through.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal was no great persecutor of Hereticks,<note place="margin">The progress of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> which was generally
thought to flow from his hatred of the Clergy, and that he was not ill pleased
to have them depressed. During the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings process, there was
no prosecution of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine, whether this
flowed from any Intimation of the Kings pleasure to the Bishops or not, I
cannot tell, but it is very probable it must have been so, for these opinions
were receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many, and the Popish Clergy were so inclined to severity,
that as they wanted not Occasions, so they had a good mind to use those
Preachers cruelly, so that it is likely the King restrained them, and that was
always mixed with the other threatnings to work upon the Pope, that Heresie
would prevail in <hi>England,</hi> if the King got not justice done him, so
that till the Cardinal fell, they were put to no further trouble.</p>
            <p>But as soon as <hi>More</hi> came into favour, he pressed the King
much, to put the Laws against Hereticks in execution, and suggested that the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would be more wrought upon, by the Kings sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the
Church, and defending the Faith vigorously, than by threatnings: and therefore
a long Proclamation was issued out against the Hereticks, many of their Books
were prohibited, and all the Laws against them were appointed to be put in
execution,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fox.</hi>
               </note> and great care was taken to
seize them as they came into <hi>England,</hi> but many escaped their
diligence.</p>
            <p>There were some at <hi>Antwerp, Tindal, Ioye,
Constantine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tindal</hi> and others at
  <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerp.</hi>
               </note> with a few more, that were every year writing and
printing new Books chiefly against the corruptions of the Clergy, the
Superstition of pilgrimages, of worshiping Images, Saints, and Relicks, and
against relying on these things, which were then called in the common style,
<hi>Good works,</hi> in opposition to which they wrote much about Faith in
Christ with a true Evangelical obedience, as the only mean by which men could
be saved. The Book that had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Authority and influence, was
<hi>Tindals</hi> Translation of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, of which the Bishops made
great complaints, and said, it was full of errors. But <hi>Tonstall</hi> then
Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> being a man of invincible moderation, would do no

               </note> yet endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured as he
could, to get their Books into his hands: So being at <hi>Antwerp</hi> in the
year 1529. as he returned from his Embassie at the Treaty of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
he sent for one <hi>Packington</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Merchant there, and
desired him to see how many New Testaments of <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> Translation he
might have for Money. <hi>Packington,</hi> who was a secret favourer of
<hi>Tindal,</hi> told him, what the Bishop proposed. <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> was very

from thence concluded there must be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible contrariety, between that book
and the Doctrines of those who so handled it; by which both their prejudice
against the Clergy, and their desire of reading the New Testament was
encreased. So that next year, when the Second Edition was finished, many more
were brought over, and <hi>Constantine</hi> being taken in <hi>England,</hi>
the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor in a private examination, promised him that no hurt should
be done him if he would reveal who encouraged and supported them at
<hi>Antwerp</hi>; which he accepted of, and told that the greatest
encouragement they had, was from the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> who had bought
up half the Impression. This made all that heard of it laugh heartily, though
more judicious persons discerned the great temper of that Learned Bishop in it.
When the Clergy condemned <hi>Tindals</hi> Translation of the New Testament,
they declared they intended to set out a true Translation of it; which many
thought, was never truly designed by them, but only pretended, that they might
restrain the Curiosity of seeing <hi>Tindals</hi> work, with the hopes of one
that should be Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized: and as they made no progress in it, so at length on
the 24th of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1530. there was a paper drawn and agreed to by
Arch-Bishop <hi>Warham,</hi> Chancellor <hi>More,</hi> Bishop
<hi>Tonstall,</hi> and many Canonists and Divines, which every Incumbent was
commanded to read to his Parish, as a warning to prevent the Contagion of

               <q>The Contents of which were, that the King having called together
  many of the Prelates, with other Learned men out of both Universities, to
  examine some Books lately set out in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> tongue, they had
  agreed to condemn them, as containing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral points of Heresie in them; and
  it being proposed to them, whether it was necessary to set forth the Scriptures
  in the vulgar tongue, they were of opinion, that though it had been sometimes
  done, yet it was not necessary, and that the King did well, not to set it out
  at that time in the <hi>English</hi> tongue. So by this all the hopes of a
  Translation of the Scriptures vanished.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There came out another Book which took mightily, it was enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
<hi>The Supplication of the Beggars,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Supplication of the
  Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars.</note> written by one <hi>Simon Fish</hi> of <hi>Grayes-Inn.</hi> In
it the Beggars complained to the King, that they were reduced to great misery,
the Alms of the people being intercepted by companies of strong and idle
Friars; for supposing that each of the Five Mendicant Orders, had but a Peny a
quarter from every hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold, it did rise to a vast Sum, of which the Indigent
and truly Necessitous Beggars were defrauded. Their being unprofitable to the
Common-wealth, with several other things, were also complained of. He also
taxed the Pope for Cruelty and Covetousness, that did not deliver all persons
out of Purgatory, and that none but the Rich who payed well for it, could be
discharged out of that Prison. This was written in a witty and taking Style,
and the King had it put in <pb n="161" facs="tcp:104314:100"/> his hands by <hi>Anne
Boleyn,</hi> and lik'd it well, and would not suffer any thing to be done to
the Author.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <hi>More</hi> was the most zealous Champion the Clergy
had,<note place="margin">

  it.</note> for I do not find that any of them wrote much, only the Bishop of
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> wrote for Purgatory; but the rest left it wholly to him,
either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause few of them could write well, or that he being much esteemed,
and a disinteressed person, things would be better received from him, than from
them who were look'd on as Parties. So he answered this Supplication by
another, in the name of the souls that were in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; representing the
miseries they were in, and the great relief they found by the Masses the Friers
said for them, and brought in every mans Ancestours calling earnestly upon him
to befriend those poor Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars now, when they had so many Enemies. He
confidently asserted, it had been the Doctrine of the Church for many Ages, and
brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places out of the Scriptures to prove it, besides several reasons
that seemed to confirm it. This, being writ of a Subject that would allow of a
great deal of popular and moving Eloquence, in which he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eminent, took
with many.</p>
            <p>But it discovered to others what was the Foundation of those
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Orders,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Frith</hi> replie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and that if the belief of Purgatory were once
rooted out, all that was built on that Foundation must needs fall with it. So
<hi>Iohn Frith</hi> wrote an answer to <hi>More</hi>'s Supplication, to shew,
that there was no ground for Purgatory in Scripture; and that it was not
believed in the Primitive Church. He also answered the Bishop of
<hi>Rochester</hi>'s Book, and some Dialogues that were written on the same
Subject, by <hi>Rastal</hi> a Printer, and Kinsman of <hi>Mores</hi>: He
discovered the fallacy of their reasonings, which were built on the weakness,
or defects of our Repentance in this Life; and that therefore there must be
another state in which we must be further purified. To this he answered, That
our sins were not pardoned for our Repentance, or the Perfection of it, but
only for the Merits and Sufferings of Christ; and that if our Repentance is
sincere, God accepts of it; and sin being once pardoned, it could not be
further punished. He shewed the difference between the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we may
suffer in this Life, and those in Purgatory; the one are either Medicinal
Corrections for Reforming us more and more, or for giving Warning to others:
The other are terrible Punishments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of these ends in them:
therefore the one might well consist with the free pardon of sin, the other
could not. So he argued from all these places of Scripture, in which we are
said to be freely pardoned our sins by the Blood of Christ, that no punishment
in another state could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with it: He also argued from all those places
in which it is said, that we shall at the day of Judgment receive according to
what we have done in the body, that there was no state of Purgatory beyond this
life. For the places brought out of the Old Testament, he shewed they could not
be meant of Purgatory, since according to the Doctrine of the School-men there
was no going to Purgatory before Christ. For the places in the New Testament he
appealed to <hi>More</hi>'s great Friend, <hi>Erasmus,</hi> whose Exposition of
these places differed much from his Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. That place in the Epistle to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> about <hi>the fire,</hi> that was to try every mans work,
he said, was plainly Allegorical; and since the Foundation, the building of
Gold, Silver, and precious Stones; of Wood, <pb n="162" facs="tcp:104314:101"/> Hay and
Stubble, were Figuratively taken, there was no reason to take the <hi>fire</hi>
in a literal sense: therefore by <hi>fire</hi> was to be understood the
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution then near at hand; called in other places, <hi>the fiery
trial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Ancient Doctors, he shewed, that in the fourth Century,
St. <hi>Ambrose, Ierome,</hi> and St. <hi>Austin,</hi> the three great Doctors
of that Age did not believe it, and cited several passages out of their
Writings. It is true, St. <hi>Austin</hi> went further than the rest, for
though in some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages he delivered his Opinion against it, yet in other
places he spake of it more doubtfully as a thing that might be enquired into,
but that it could not be certainly known; and indeed before <hi>Gregory</hi>
the <hi>Greats</hi> time, it was not received in the Church, and then the
<hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks were beginning to spread and grow numerous, and they
to draw advantages from it, told many stories of Visions and Dreams, to possess
the world with the belief of it; then the trade grew so profitable, that ever
since it was kept up, and improved: and what succeeded so well with one Society
and Order, to enrich themselves much by it, was an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to others to
follow their tract in the same way of traffick. This Book was generally well
received, and the Clergy were so offended at the Author, that they resolved to
make him feel a real fire whenever he was catched, for endeavoring to put out
their imaginary one.</p>
            <p>That from which <hi>More</hi> and others took greatest advantage,
was, that the new preachers prevailed only on simple Tradsemen, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and
other illiterate persons: but to this the others answered, That the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> made the same objection to the followers of <hi>Christ,</hi>
who were Fisher-men, women, and rude Mechanicks; but Christ told them, <hi>that
to the poor the Gospel was preached</hi>; and when the Philosophers and Jews
objected that to the Apostles: They said Gods glory did the more appear, since
not many rich, wise, or noble, were called, but the poor and despised were
chosen: that men who had much to lose, had not that simplicity of mind, nor
that disingagement from worldly things, that was a necessary disposition to fit
them for a Doctrine, which was like to bring much trouble and persecution on
them.</p>
            <p>Thus I have opened some of these things, which were at that time
disputed by the pen,<note place="margin">The cruel proceedings against the
  Reformers.</note> in which opposition new things were still star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and
examined. But this was too feeble a weapon for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Clergy,
therefore they sought out sharper tools. So there were many brought into the
Bishops Courts, some for teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Children the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> in
English, some for reading the forbidden Books, some for harbouring the
Preachers, some for speaking against Pilgrimages, or the worshipping and
adorning of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, some for not observing the Church Fasts, some for not
coming to Confession and the Sacrament, and some for speaking against the Vices
of the Clergy. Most of these were simple and illiterate men, and the terrour of
the Bishops Courts, and Prisons, and of a Faggot in the end, wrought so much on
their fears and weakness, that they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally abjured, and were dismissed. But
in the end of the year, 1530. one <hi>Thomas Hitton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>More.</hi>
               </note> who had been Curate of <hi>Maidston,</hi>
and had left that place, going oft to <hi>Antwerp</hi>; he bringing over some
of the Books that were printed there, was taken at <hi>Gravesend,</hi> and
brought before <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Fisher,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tindal.</hi>
               </note> who, after he had suffered much by a long
and cruel Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, condemned him to be Burnt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:104314:101"/>The most eminent person that suffered about
this time, was <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Bilney,</hi> of whose Abjuration an account was
given in the first Book: he after that, went to <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bilneys</hi> Tryal.</note> and was much troubled in his
Conscience, for what he had done, so that the rest of that Society at
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> were in great apprehensions of some violent effect, which
that desperation might produce,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Latimers</hi>
  Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> and sometimes watched him whole nights. This continued about a
year, but at length his mind was more quieted, and he resolved to expiate his
Abjuration, by as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and solemn a Confession of the Truth: and to prepare
himself the better both to defend and suffer for the Doctrines, which he had
formerly through fear denyed; he followed his Studies for two years. And when
he found himself well fortified in this resolution, he took leave of his
Friends at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and went to his own Countrey of
<hi>Norfolk,</hi> to whom he thought he owed his first endeavours.</p>
            <p>He preached up and down the Countrey,<note place="margin">The things
  objected to him.</note> confessing his former sin of denying the Faith, and
taught the people to beware of Idolatry, or trusting to Pilgrimages, to the
Cowle of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> to the Prayers of Saints, or to Images; but
exhorted them to stay at home,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fox.</hi>
               </note> to give
much Alms, to believe in Jesus Christ, and to offer up their hearts, wills, and
minds, to him in the Sacrament. This being noised about he was seized on by the
Bishops Officers, and put in Prison at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and the Writ was sent
for to burn him as a Relapse, he being first condemned and degraded from his
Priesthood: while he was in Prison the Friars came oft about him to perswade
him to recant again, and it was given out that he did read a Bill of
Abjuration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>More</hi> not being satisfied to have sent the Writ for his
burning,<note place="margin">It is given out that he abjured.</note> stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
also to defame him, publishing this to the World; yet in that he was certainly
abused, for if he had signed any such Paper, it had been put in the Bishops
Register, as all things of that nature were; but no such writing was ever
shewn, only some said they heard him read it, and others who denyed there was
any such thing, being questioned for it, submitted and confessed their fault.
But at such a time it was no strange thing, if a ly of that nature, was vented
with so much Authority, that men were afraid to contradict it; and when a man
is a close Prisoner, those who only have access to him, may spread what report
of him they please, and when once such a thing is said, they never want
officious vouchers to ly and swear for it. But since nothing was ever show'd
under his hand, it is clear there was no truth in these reports, which were
spread about to take away the honour of Martyrdom from the new Doctrines. It is
true he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enquired into all the other Tenets of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and so did not differ from them about the presence of Christ in
the Sacrament and some other things. But when men durst speak freely,<note place="margin">

repeated that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in <hi>Isaiah, When thou walk'st through the fire thou
shall not be burnt</hi>; and putting his finger in the flame of the Candle, he
told those about him, that he well knew what a pain burning was, but that it
should only consume the Stubble of his Body, and that his Soul should be purged
by it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The manner of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>When the
day of Execution came, being the 10th of <hi>November,</hi> as he was led out,
he said to one that exhorted him to be patient and constant, that as the
Mariners endured the tossing of the Waves, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to arrive at their desired
Port, so though he was now entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a storm, yet he hop'd he should soon
arrive at the Haven, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired their Prayers. When he came to the Stake, he
repeated the Creed, to show the People that he dyed in the Faith of the
Apostles; then he put up his Prayers to God with great show's of inward
devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which ended, he repeated the 143 <hi>Psalm,</hi> and paus'd on these
words of it, <hi>Enter not into Iudgment with thy Servant, for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified,</hi> with deep recollection: and when Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Warner,</hi> that accompanied him to the Stake, took leave of him with many
tears, <hi>Bilney</hi> with a chearful countenance exhorted him, to feed his
flock, that at his Lords coming he might find him so doing. Many of the begging
Friars desired him to declare to the people, that they had not procured his
death; for that was got among them, and they feared the people would give them
no more Alms: so he desired the Spectators not to be the worse to these men for
his sake, for they had not procur'd his death. Then the fire was set to, and
his Body consum'd to ashes.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, both what Opinion the people had of him, and in
what charity he dyed even towards his enemies, doing them good for evil; but
this, though it perhaps struck terror in weaker minds, yet it no less
encourag'd others to endure patiently all the severities that were us'd to draw
them from this Doctrine. Soon after, one <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Byfield</hi>

Monk of St. <hi>Edmundsbury,</hi> and had been instructed by Doctor
<hi>Barnes,</hi> who gave him some Books; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discovered, he was put
in Prison, but through fear abjured; yet afterward he left the Monastery and
came to <hi>London</hi>: He went oft over to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and brought in
forbidden Books, which being smell'd out, he was seized on, and examined about
these Books; he justified them, and said, he thought they were good and
profitable, and did openly exclaim against the dissolute lives of the Clergy;
so being judged Heretick, he was burnt in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> the 11th of
<hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>

               </note>In
<hi>December,</hi> one <hi>Iohn Tewksbury</hi> a Shop-keeper in

<hi>Thomas Mores</hi> house at <hi>Chelsey,</hi> where Sentence was given

            <p>These proceedings were complain'd of in the following Session of
Parliament, as was formerly told, and the Ecclesiastical Courts being found
both Arbitrary and Cruel, the House of Commons desired a redress of that from
the King; but nothing was done about it till <pb n="165" facs="tcp:104314:103"/> Three years
after, that the new Act against Hereticks was made, as was already told. The
Clergy were not much moved at the address which the House of Commons made, and
therefore went on in their extreme Courses, and to strike a Terror in the
Gentry, they resolved to make an Example of one <hi>Iames Bainham</hi> a
Gentleman of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>: he was carryed to the Lord Chancellors
House,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bainham</hi>'s Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> where much

made him be whipt in his own presence, and after that, sent him to the
<hi>Tower,</hi> where he look't on, and saw him put to the Rack. Yet it seems
nothing could be drawn from him, that might be made use of, to any other
persons hurt; yet he himself afterwards overcome with fear, abjured and did
penance, but had no quiet in his Conscience, till he went publickly to Church,
with a New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his hand, and confess'd with many tears, that he had
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed God, and prayed the people not to do as he had done, and said, that he
felt an Hell in his own Conscience, for what he had done. So he was soon after
carryed to the <hi>To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

now the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, to avoid the Imputation of using men cruelly in their

said, 
<q>That <hi>Thomas a Becket</hi> was a Murderer, and damned in Hell
  if he did not repent; and for speaking contemptously of praying to Saints, and
  saying that the Sacrament of the Altar was only Christs Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body, and

was judged an obstinate and relaps'd Heretick, and was burnt in

  and Benedictions used by the Church were good: That it was good and profitable
  to set up the Images of Christ and the Saints in the Churches, and to adorn
  them and burn Candles before them; and that Kings were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give
  their people the Scriptures in a vulgar tongue.</q> By these Articles it may be
easily Collected, what were the Doctrines then preach'd by the Reformers. There
was yet no dispute about the presence of Christ in the Sacrament, which was

            <p>But in the year 1532. there was another memorable instance of the

                  <hi>Harding</hi>'s Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> an Ancient man, who had
abjured in the year 1506. was now observed to go often into woods, and was seen
sometimes reading. Upon which his house was search'd, and some parcels of the
New Testament in <hi>English</hi> were found in it. So he was carryed before
<hi>Longland</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who as he was a cruel Persecutor,
so being the Kings Confessor, acted with the more Authority. This Aged man was
judged a Relapse, and sent to <hi>Chesham,</hi> where he lived, to be burn't,
which was Executed on <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Eve. At this time there was an
Indulgence of 40 dayes pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to all that carryed a Faggot to the
burning of an Heretick: So dextrously did the Clergy endeavor to infect the
Laity with their own cruel Spirit; and that wrought upon this occasion a signal
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for as the fire was kindled, one flung a Faggot at the old mans
head,<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">1533.</note>In the year 1533. it was thought
fit by some signal evidence to convince the World, that the King did not design
to change the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd Religion, though he had then proceeded far in his
breach with <hi>Rome</hi>; and the crafty Bishop of <hi>Winchester,
Gardiner,</hi> as he complyed with the King in his second Marriage and
separation from <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Friths</hi>
  Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> so being an inveterate Enemy to the Reformation, and in his
heart addicted to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> did by this argument often
prevail with the King, to punish the Hereticks, That it would most effectually
justifie his other proceedings, and convince the World that he was still a good
Catholick King; which at several times drew the King to what he desired. And at
this time, the steps the King had made in his Separation from the Pope, had
given such heart to the new Preachers, that they grew bolder and more publick
in their Assemblies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Frith,</hi> as he was an excellent Schollar, which was so
taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, some years before, that he was put in the list of those whom
the Cardinal intended to bring from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and put in his
Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <pb n="167" facs="tcp:104314:104"/> at <hi>Oxford</hi>; so he had offended them by
several writings, and by a discourse which he wrote against the Corporal
presence of Christ, in the Sacrament, had provoked the King, who continued to
his death to believe that firmly. 
<q>The substance of his Arguments was, that Christ in the Sacrament
  gave eternal life,<note place="margin">His Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against the Corporal
 presence.</note> but the receiving the bare Sacrament did not give eternal
  life, since many took it to their damnation; therefore Christs presence there,
  was only felt by Faith. This he further proved by the Fathers before Christ,
  who did eat the same spiritual food, and drink of the Rock, which was Christ,
  according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>: since then, they and we communicate in the same
  thing, and it was certain that they did not eat Christs Flesh Corporally, but
  fed by Faith on a <hi>Messias</hi> to come, as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do on a
  <hi>Messias</hi> already come: therefore we now do only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate by Faith.
  He also insisted much on the signification of the word Sacrament, from whence
  he concluded, that the Elements must be the Mystical Signs of Christs Body and
  Blood; for if they were truly the Flesh and Blood of Christ, they should not be
  Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: he concluded, that the ends of the Sacrament were these three, by
  a visible action to knit the Society of Christians together in one body, to be
  a means of conveighing Grace upon our due participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, and to be
  Remembrances to stir up men to bless
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od for that unspeakable love,
  which in the death of Christ appeared to mankind. To all these ends the
  Corporal presence of Christ availed nothing, they being sufficiently answered
  by a Mystical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: yet he drew no other Conclusion from these Premisses,
  but that the belief of the Corporal presence in the Sacrament, was no necessary
  Article of our Faith.</q> This either flowed from his not having yet arrived at
a sure perswasion in the matter, or that he chose in that modest style, to
encounter an opinion of which the World was so fond, that to have opposed it in
down-right words, would have given prejudices against all that he could
say.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frith</hi> upon a long conversation with one upon this
Subject, was desired to set down the heads of it in writing, which he did. The
Paper went about and was by a false Brother conveyed to Sr. <hi>Thomas
More's</hi> hands, who set himself to answer it in his ordinary style, treating
<hi>Frith</hi> with great contempt, calling him alwayes the young man.
<hi>Frith</hi> was in Prison before he saw <hi>Mores</hi> Book, yet he wrote a
reply to it, which I do not find was then published; but a Copy of it was
brought afterwards to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who acknowledged when he wrote his
Apology against <hi>Gardiner,</hi> that he had received great light in that
matter from <hi>Friths</hi> Books, and drew most of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments out of it.
It was afterwards Printed with his works <hi>Anno</hi> 1573. and by it may
appear, how much Truth is Stronger than Error. For though <hi>More</hi> wrote
with as much Wit and Eloquence as any man in that Age did, and <hi>Frith</hi>
wrote plainly without any Art; yet there is so great a difference between their
Books, that whoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them, will clearly perceive the one to be the
Ingenious defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of an ill cause, and the other a simple asserter of Truth.
<hi>Frith</hi> wrote with all the disadvantage that was possible, being then in
the Jayl, where he could have no Books, but some Notes he might have collected
formerly: he was also so loaded with Irons, that he could <pb n="168" facs="tcp:104314:105"/> scarce sit with any ease. He began with confirming what he had
deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered about the Fathers before Christ, their feeding on his Body in the
same manner that Christians do since his death: This he proved from Scripture,
and several places of St. <hi>Austins</hi> works; he proved also from
Scripture, that after the Consecration, the Elements were still <hi>Bread</hi>
and <hi>Wine,</hi> and were so called both by our Saviour and his Apostles;
that our Senses shew they are not changed in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that they are
still subject to Corruption, which can no way be said of the body of Christ. He
proved that the eating of Christs Flesh in the 6th of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> cannot
be applyed to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; since the wicked receive it, who yet do not eat
the Flesh of Christ, otherwise they should have eternal life. He shewed also,
that the Sacrament coming in the room of the Jewish Paschal Lamb, we must
understand Christs words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> in the same sense in which
it was said, that the Lamb was <hi>the Lords Passover.</hi> He confirmed this
by many passages, cited out of <hi>Tertullian, Athanasius, Chrysostome,
Ambrose, Ierome, Austin, Fulgentius, Eusebius,</hi> and some later Writers, as
<hi>Beda, Bertram</hi> and <hi>Druthmar,</hi> who did all assert that the
Elements retained their former Natures, and were only the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Signs,
and Figures of the Body and Blood of Christ. But <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius</hi>'s words
seemed so remarkable, that they could not but deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Controversie,
especially considering he was Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>: he therefore writing
against the <hi>Eutichians,</hi> who thought the humane nature of Christ was
changed into the Divine, says, <hi>that as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of Bread and Wine
being Consecrated to be the Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Christ, did not
cease to be Bread and Wine in Substance, but continued in their own proper
natures</hi>; so the humane nature of Christ continued still, though it was
united to the Divine nature: this was a manifest Indication of the belief of
the Church in that Age, and ought to weigh more than a hundred high Rhetorical
Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He brought likewise several testimonies out of the Fathers to
shew that they knew nothing of the Consequences that follow
Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation; of a Body being in more places at once, or being in a
place after the manner of a Spirit, or of the worship to be given to the
Sacrament. Upon this he digresses, and says, that the <hi>German</hi> Divines
believed a Corporal presence; yet since that was only an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that rested
in their minds, and did not carry along with it any Corruption of the worship,
or Idolatrous practise, it was to be born with, and the peace of the Church was
not to be broken for it: but the case of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was very
different, which had set up gross Idolatry, building it upon this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given a short Abstract of <hi>Friths</hi> Book, which
I thought fit, the rather to do, because it was the first Book that was written
on this Subject in <hi>England</hi> by any of the Reformers. And from hence it
may appear, upon what solid and weighty reasons they then began to shake the
received Opinion of Transubstantiation: and with how much learning this
Controversie was managed by him, who first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook it.</p>
            <p>One thing was singular in <hi>Friths</hi> Opinion, that he thought
there should be no contest made about the manner of Christs presence in the
Sacrament; for what-ever Opinion men held in Speculation, if 
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104314:105"/> it went not to a practical error (which was the
Adoration of it, for that was Idolatry in his Opinion) there were no disputes
to be made about it, therefore he was much against all heats between the
<hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> for he thought in such a matter
that was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speculative, every man might hold his own Opinion without
mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a breach of the Unity of the Church about it.</p>
            <p>He was apprehended in <hi>May</hi> 1533. and kept in Prison till
the 20th of <hi>Iune,</hi> and then he was brought before the Bishop of
<hi>London, Gardiner,</hi> and <hi>Longland</hi> sitting with him.<note place="margin">Register <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They objected to him his Opinions about the <hi>Sacrament</hi> and
<hi>Purgatory</hi>; he answered, that for the first he did not find
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> in the Scriptures, nor in any approved Authors; and
therefore he would not admit any thing as an Article of Faith, without clear
and certain grounds: for he did not think the Authority of the Church reached
so far. They argued with him upon some passages out of St. <hi>Austin</hi> and
St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> to which he answered, by opposing other places of
the same Fathers, and shew'd how they were to be reconciled to themselves; when
it came to a Conclusion, these words are set down in the Register as his
Confession.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Frith</hi> thinketh and judgeth that the natural Body of

  once.<note place="margin">His Opinio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

 of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>Item</hi> he saith, that neither part is a
  necessary Article of our Faith, whether the natural Body be there in the
  Sacrament or not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Purgatory,</hi> he said a man consisted of two parts,
his Body and Soul; his Body was purged by sickness and other pains, and at last
by death, and was not by their own Doctrine sent to Purgatory. And for the
Soul, it was purged through the word of God received by Faith. So his
Confession was written down in these words. 
<q>
                  <hi>Item Frith</hi> thinketh and judgeth that there is no
  Purgatory for the Soul after that it is departed from the Body, and as he
  thinketh herein,<note place="margin">And of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</note> so hath he said,
  written, and defended, howbeit he thinketh neither part to be an Article of
  Faith, necessarily to be believed under pain of Damnation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Bishops with the Doctors that stood about them, took much
pains to make him change; but he told them, that he could not be induced to
believe, that these were Articles of Faith. And when they threatned to proceed
to a Final Sentence, he seemed not moved with it, but said, <hi>Let judgment be
done in righteousness.</hi> The Bishops, though none of them were guilty of
great tenderness, yet seem'd to pity him much; and the Bishop of
<hi>London</hi> professed, he gave Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with great grief of heart. In the
end he was judged an Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Heretick, and was delivered to the Secular
Power:<note place="margin">He is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> there is one clause in this
Sentence, which is not in many others, therefore I shall set it down.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>Most earnestly requiring in the Bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ,
  that this Execution and punishment worthily to be done upon thee, may be so
  moderate, that the rigor thereof be not too extreme, nor yet the gentleness too
  much mitigated, but that it may be to the Salvation of thy Soul, to the
  extirpation, terror, and conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hereticks, and to the Unity of the
  Catholick Faith.</q> This was thought a scorning of God and men, when those,
who knew <pb n="170" facs="tcp:104314:106"/> that he was to be burnt, and intended it should
be so, yet used such an Obtestation by the Bowels of Jesus Christ, that the
rigor might not be extreme. This being certified, the Writ was issued out, and
as the Register bears, he was burnt in <hi>Smithfield</hi> the 4th of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> and one <hi>Andrew Hewet</hi> with him, who also denyed the
Presence of Christ in the Sacrament of the Altar. This <hi>Hewet</hi> was an
Apprentice, and went to the meetings of these Preachers, and was twice betrayed
by some spies whom the Bishops Officers had among them, who disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered many.
When he was examined, he would not acknowledge the Corporal Presence, but was
illiterate, and resolved to do as <hi>Frith</hi> did, so he was also condemned
and burnt with him.</p>

               <note place="margin">His Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note>When
they were brought to the Stake, <hi>Frith</hi> expressed great joy, at his

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aggots in his Arms, as the
Instruments that were to send him to his eternal rest. One Doctor <hi>Cook</hi>
a Parson of <hi>London</hi> called to the people, that they should not pray for
them any more than they would do for a Dog. At which <hi>Frith</hi> smiled, and
prayed God to forgive him; so the fire was set to, and they were consum'd to
Ashes.</p>
            <p>This was the last Act of the Clergies Cruelty against mens lives,
and was much condemned: it was thought an unheard-of barbarity, thus to burn a
moderate and learned young man, only because he would not acknowledge some of
their Doctrines to be Articles of Faith; and though his private judgment was
against their tenet, yet he was not positive in it, any further, than that he
could not believe the contrary to be necessary to Salvation. But the Clergy
were now so bathed in blood, that they seemed to have strip't themselves of
those impressions of pity and compassion, which are natural to mankind; they
therefore held on in their severe courses, till the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did
effectually restrain them.</p>

the Bishop of <hi>London.</hi> The proceedings against him, had been both
extreme and illegal; he was first apprehended, and put in the <hi>Tower</hi>
upon suspition of Heresie, and when they searched him, a Copy of
<hi>Tracy's</hi> Testament was found about him, and Butter and Cheese were
found in his Chamber, it being in the time of <hi>Lent.</hi> There was also
another Letter found about him, exhorting him to be ready to suffer constantly
for the Truth. Upon these presumptions the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> proceeded
against him, and required him to abjure. But he said, he would willingly swear
to be obedient as a Christian man ought, and that he would never hold any
Heresie du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life, nor favour Hereticks; but the Bishop would not accept
of that, since there might be Ambiguities in it: therefore he requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to
make the Abjuration in common form, which he refused to do, and appealed to the
King as the Supreme Head of the Church. Yet the Bishop pronounced him
<hi>Contumax,</hi> and did excommunicate him; but whether he was released on
his Appeal, or not, I do not find; yet perhaps this was the man of whom the
Pope complained to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Ambassadors 1532. that an Heretick
having appealed to the King as the Supreme Head of the Church, was taken out of
the Bishops hands, and judged and acquitted in the Kings Courts. It is probable
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104314:106"/> this was the man, only the Pope was informed, that it
was from the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> that he Appealed, in which
there might be a mistake for the Bishop of <hi>London.</hi> But whatever ground
there may be for that conjecture, <hi>Philips</hi> got his liberty, and put in

Hereticks.</p>

the Popes Authority, and the Power being lodged in the King to correct and
reform Heresies, Idolatries, and Abuses, the Standard of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith
being also declared to be the Scriptures, the Persecuted Preachers had ease and
encouragement every-where. They also saw that the necessity of the Kings
Affairs, would constrain him to be gentle to them, for the Sentence which the
Pope gave against the King, was committed to the Emperor to be executed by him,
who was then as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring to an universal Monarchy; and therefore as soon as his
other Wars gave him leisure to look over to <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> he had now a good colour to justifie an Invasion both from
the Popes Sentence, and the interests and honour of his Family in protecting
his Aunt and her Daughter: Therefore the King was to give him work elsewhere,
in order to which his interest obliged him to joyn himself to the Princes of
<hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> who had at <hi>Smalcald</hi> entred into a League offensive
and defensive, for the liberty of Religion and the Rights of the Empire. This
was a thorn in the Emperor's side, which the Kings Interest would oblige him by
all means to maintain. Upon which the Reformers in <hi>England</hi> concluded,
that either the King, to recommend himself to these Princes, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax the
severities of the Law against them; or otherwise, that their Friends in
<hi>Germany</hi> would see to it: for in these first fervours of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the Princes made that always a condition in their Treaties, that those who
favoured their Doctrine, might be no more persecuted.</p>
            <p>But their chief encouragement was from the Queen,<note place="margin">The Queen favoured the Reformers.</note> who Reigned in the Kings
heart, as absolutely as he did over his Subjects; and was a known favourer of
them. She took <hi>Shaxton</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> to be her Chaplains, and
soon after promoted them to the Bishopricks of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and
<hi>Worcester,</hi> then vacant by the deprivation of <hi>Campegio</hi> and

               <hi>Cranmer</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was a
professed favourer of it, who besides the Authority of his Character and See,
was well-fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for carrying it on, being a very Learned and Industrious man.
He was at great pains to collect the sense of Ancient Writers, upon all the
Heads of Religion, by which he might be well-directed in such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
matter. I have seen two Volumns <hi>in Folio</hi> written with his own Hand,
containing upon all the Heads of Religion, a vast heap both of places of
Scripture, and Quotations out of Ancient Fathers, and later Doctors, and
School-men; by which he governed himself in that work. There is also an
original Letter of the Lord <hi>Burghly</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, which I have seen, in
which he writes that he had six or seven Volumns of his Writings, all which,
except two other, that I have seen, are lost, for ought I can understand. From
which it will appear in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this work, that he neither Copied form
Forreign Writers, nor proceeded rashly in the Reformation. He was a man of
great temper, and as I have seen in some of his Letters to <hi>Osiander,</hi>
and some of <hi>Osian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s <pb facs="tcp:104314:107"/> answers to him, he very much
disliked the violence of the <hi>German</hi> Divines. He was gentle in his
whole behaviour, and though he was a man of too great candour and simplicity to
be refined in the Arts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, yet he managed his Affairs with great
prudence; which did so much recommend him to the King, that no ill Offices were
ever able to hurt him. It is true, he had some singular opinions about
Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Functions and Offices, which he seemed to make wholly
depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the Magistrate, as much as the Civil were; but as he never
studied to get his opinion in that made a part of the Doctrine of the Church,
reserving only to himself the freedom of his own thoughts, which I have reason
to think he did afterwards, either change, or at least was content to be
over-ruled in it: So it is clear that he held not that opinion, to get the
Kings favour by it, for in many other things, as in the business of the six
Articles, he boldly and freely argued, both in the Convocation and the House of
Peers, against that which he knew was the Kings mind, and took his life in his
hands, which had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been offered at a stake, if the Kings esteem of him
had not been proof against all attempts.</p>

               <note place="margin">Assisted by <hi>Cromwell.</hi>
               </note>Next him,
or rather above him, was <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who was made the Kings Vice-gerent
in Ecclesiastical matters. A man of mean Birth, but Noble Qualities, as
appeared in two signal Instances, the one being his Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Parliament so
zealously and successfully for the fallen and disgrac'd Cardinal, whose
Secretary he was, when <hi>Gardiner,</hi> though more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him, had
basely forsaken him. This was thought so just and generous in him, that it did
not at all hinder his Preferment, but raised his Credit higher: Such a
Demonstration of gratitude and friendship, in misfortune, being so rare a thing
in a Court. The other was his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Merchant of <hi>Lucca,</hi> that
had pitied and relieved him, when he was a poor stranger there, and expressing
most extraordinary acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements and gratitude, when he was afterwards in
the top of his Greatness, and the other did not so much as know him, much less
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any returns for passed favours, which shew'd that he had a noble
and generous temper; only he made too much haste to be great and rich. He
joyned himself in a firm friendship to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the
Reformation very vigorously.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and
  <hi>Gardiner</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it.</note>But there was another Party in the Court,
that wrestled much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; the head of it was the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk,</hi> who though he was the Queens Uncle, yet was her mortal enemy.
He was a dextrous Courtier and complied with the King, both in his Divorce and
Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from <hi>Rome,</hi> yet did upon all occasions perswade the King to
innovate nothing in Religion: His great friend that joyned all along with him
in those Counsels, was <hi>Gardiner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> who was
a crafty and politick man, and understood the King well, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with his
temper in every thing; he despised <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and hated all Reformation.
<hi>Longland</hi> that had been the Kings Confessor, was also managed by them,
and they had a great Party in the Court, and almost all the Church-men were on
their side.</p>

               <note place="margin">Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note>That
which prevailed most with the King, was, that himself had writ a Book in
Defence of the Faith, and they said, would he now retract that, which all
Learned men admired so much? or would he encourage <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and his
Party, who had treated him with so little respect? If he <pb n="173" facs="tcp:104314:107"/>
went to change the Doctrines that were formerly received, all the world would
say he did it in spite to the Pope, which would cast a great dishonour on him,
as if his passion govern'd his Religion. Forreign Princes, who in their hearts,
did not much blame him for what he had hitherto done, but rather wished for a
good opportunity to do the like, would now condemn him if he medled with the
Faith: And his own Subjects, who complied with that which he had done, and were
glad to be delivered from Forreign Jurisdiction, and the Exactions of the Court
of <hi>Rome,</hi> would not bear a change of the Religion, but might be thereby
easily set on, by the Emissaries of the Pope or Emperor, to break out in
Rebellion. These things being managed skilfully, and agreeing with his own
private opinion, wrought much on him; and particularly, what was said about his
own Book, which had been so much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him, that he was almost made
believe, it was written by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Inspiration of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>But on the other side <hi>Cranmer</hi> represented to him,<note place="margin">Reasons for it.</note> that since he had put down the Popes
Authority, it was not fit to let those Doctrines be still taught, which had no
other Foundation, but the Decrees of Popes: And he offered upon the greatest
hazard to prove, that many things, then received as Articles of Faith, were no
better grounded; therefore he pressed the King to give order, to hear and
examine things freely, that when the Popes power was rejected, the people might
not be obliged to believe Doctrines, which had no better warrant. And for
Political Counsels, he was to do the duty of a good Christian Prince, and leave
the event to God; and things might be carried on with that due care, that the
justice and reasonableness of the Kings proceedings should appear to all the
world. And whereas it was objected, that the Doctrines of the Catholick Church
ought not to be examined by any particular Church. It was answered, that when
all Christendom were under one Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, it was easie for him to call general
Councils, and in such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances it was fit to stay for a one; and yet even
then, particular Churches did in their National Synods condemn Heresies, and
reform Abuses. But the State of Christendom was now altered, it was under many
Princes, who had different Interests, and therefore they thought it a vain
expectation to look for any such Council. The Protestants of <hi>Germany</hi>
had now for above ten years desired the Emperor to procure one, but to no
effect; for sometimes the Pope would not grant it, and at other times the
<hi>French</hi> King protested against it. The former year the Pope had sent to
the King to offer a general Council,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </note> to
be held at <hi>Mantua</hi> this year, but the King found that was but an
illusion; for the Marquess of <hi>Mantua</hi> protested, he would not admit
such a number of strangers, as a Council would draw together into his Town: yet
the King promised to send his Ambassadors thither, when the Council met. But
now the King consulting his Prelates, whether the Emperor might by his
Authority summon a general Council, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors had done:
some of them gave the following answer, Copied from the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal that is yet
extant,<note place="margin">A resolution of some Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops about the calling of a
  general Council.</note> which might have been written any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the

and the year, 1540. in which <hi>Iohn Clark,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and
<hi>Wells,</hi> died; but I incline to think from other circumstances, that it
was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about the end of the year, 1534.</p>

  the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> had his ample dominion over the most part of the

                        <p>That as Rich men flying from their Enemies, carry away all
  they can with them, and what they cannot take away, they either hide or destroy
  it; so the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had destroyed so many Ancient writings. and
  hid the rest, having carefully preserved every thing that was of advantage to
  them, that it was not easie to discover what they had so artificially
  concealed: Therefore in the Canon-Law, some honest truths were yet to be found,
  but so mislay'd that they are not placed where one might expect them, but are
  to be met with in some other Chapters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where one would least look for
  them. And many more things said by the Ancients, of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
  and against their Authority were lost, as appears by the Fragments yet
  remaining. He show'd that many of the Ancients called every thing which they
  thought well done, <hi>of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> by a large extent of the
  Phrase, in which sense the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of many Fathers that magnified the See of
  <hi>Rome,</hi> were to be understood.</p>
                        <p>Then he show'd for what end General Councils were called,
  to declare the Faith and reform Errors, not that ever any Council was truly
  General, for even at <hi>Nice</hi> there were no Bishops almost, but out of
  <hi>Egypt, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> but they were called General
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Emperor Summon'd them, and all Christendome did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to their
  Definitions, which he prov'd by several Authorities: therefore though there
  were many more Bishops in the Council of <hi>Arimini,</hi> than at
  <hi>Nice</hi> or <hi>Constantinople,</hi> yet the one was not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a
  General Council, and the others were: so that it was not the number, nor
  Authority of the Bishops, but the matter of their Decisions, which made them be
  received with so general a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
                        <p>As for the Head of the Council. St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St.
  <hi>Iames</hi> had the chief direction of the Council of the Apostles, but
  there were no Contests then about Head-ship. Christ named no Head, which could
  be no more called a defect in him, than it was one in God, that had named no
  Head to Govern the World. Yet the Church found it convenient to have one over
  them, so Arch-Bishops were set over Provinces. And though St. <hi>Peter</hi>
  had been Head of the Apostles, yet as it is not certain that he was ever in
  <hi>Rome,</hi> so it does not appear, that he had his Headship for
  <hi>Romes</hi> sake, or that he left it there; but he was made Head for his
  Faith, and not for the Dignity of any See: Therefore the Bishops of
  <hi>Rome</hi> could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to nothing from him, but as they followed his
  Faith; and <hi>Liberius</hi> and some other Bishops there, had been condemned
  for Heresie; and if according to St. <hi>Iames,</hi> Faith be to be tryed by
  Works, the Lives of the Popes for several Ages gave shrewd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions, that
  their Faith was not good. And though it were granted, that such a Power was
  given to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet by many instances, he show'd that
  positive precepts in a matter of that nature, were not for ever Obligatory. And
  therefore <hi>Gerson</hi> wrote a Book, <hi>De Auferibilitate Papae.</hi> So
  that if a Pope with the <pb n="176" facs="tcp:104314:109"/> Cardinals be corrupted, they
  ought to be tryed by a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and submit to it. St. <hi>Peter</hi>
  gave an account of his Baptizing <hi>Cornelius,</hi> when he was questioned
  about it. So <hi>Damasus, Sixtus,</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> purged themselves of
  some scandals.</p>
                        <p>Then he showed how Corrupt the present Pope was, both in
  his person and Government, for which he was abhorred, even by some of his
  Cardinals, as himself had heard and seen at <hi>Rome.</hi> It is true there was
  no Law to proceed against a vitious Pope, for it was a thing not foreseen, and
  thought scarcely possible, but new diseases required new remedies, and if a
  Pope that is an Heretick may be judged in a Council, the same reason would hold
  against a Symoniacal, Covetous and Impious Pope, who was Salt that had lost its
  favour. And by several Authorities, he proved, that every man who lives so, is
  thereby out of the Communion of the Church; and that as the Preheminence of the
  See of <hi>Rome</hi> flowed only from the Laws of men, so there was now good
  cause to repeal these, for the Pope, as was said in the Council of
  <hi>Basil,</hi> was only Vicar of the Church, and not of Christ, so he was
  accountable to the Church. The Council of <hi>Constance</hi> and the Divines of
  <hi>Paris</hi> had, according to the Doctrine of the Ancient Church, declared
  the Pope to be subject to a General Council, which many Popes in former Ages
  had confessed. And all that the Pope can claim even by the Canon-Law, is only
  to call and preside in a General Council, but not to overrule it, or have a
  Negative vote in it.</p>
                        <p>The Power of Councils did not extend to Princes,
  Dominions, or Secular Matters, but only to points of Faith, which they were to
  declare, and to Condemn Hereticks: nor were their Decrees Laws, till they were
  Enacted by Princes. Upon this, he enlarged much to show, that though a Council
  did proceed against a King (with which they then Threatned the King) that their
  Sentence was of no force, as being without their Sphere. The determination of
  Councils ought to be well considered and examined by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in
  matters indifferent, men ought to be left to their freedom, he taxed the
  severity of <hi>Victors,</hi> Proceedings against the Churches of the East,
  about the day of <hi>Easter.</hi> And concluded that as a Member of the Body is
  not cut off, except a Gangrene comes in it, so no part of the Church ought to
  be cut off, but upon a great and inevitable cause. And he very largely show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
  with what moderation and charity the Church should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed even against those
  that held errors. And the Standard of the Councils definitions, should only be
  taken from the Scriptures, and not from mens Traditions.</p>
                        <p>He said, some General Councils had been rejected by
  others, and it was a tender point, how much ought to be deferred to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
  some Decrees of Councils were not at all obeyed. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of <hi>Paris</hi>
  held, that a Council could not make a new Article of Faith, that was not in the
  Scriptures. And as all Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> had
  this condition implyed within them, <hi>If they kept his Commandments</hi>; so
  he thought the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to the Christian Church, had this condition in them,
  <hi>If they kept the Faith.</hi> Therefore he had much doubting in himself as
  to <pb facs="tcp:104314:109"/> General Councils, and he thought that only the word of God
  was the Rule of Faith, which ought to take place in all Controversies of
  Religion. The Scriptures were called Canonical, as being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rules of the
  Faith of Christians; and these by appointment of the Ancient Councils, were
  only to be read in the Churches. The Fathers SS. <hi>Ambrose, Ierome,</hi> and
  <hi>Austin,</hi> did in many things differ from one another, but always
  appealed to the Scriptures as the common and certain standard. And he cited
  some remarkable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> to show, what difference
  he put between the Scriptures, and all the other Writings even of the best and
  holiest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But when all the Fathers agreed in the Exposition of any
  place of Scripture, he acknowledged, he looked on that as flowing from the
  Spirit of God, and it was a most dangerous thing to be wise in our own Conceit:
  Therefore he thought Councils ought to found their decisions on the word of
  God, and those expositions of it, that had been agreed on by the Doctors of the
  Church.</p>
                        <p>Then he discoursed very largely what a person a Judge
  ought to be, he must not be Partial, nor a Judge in his own Cause, nor so much
  as sit on the Bench when it is tryed, lest his presence should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe others.
  Things also done upon a common error cannot bind, when the error upon which
  they were done, comes to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and all human Laws ought to be
  changed, when a publick visible inconvenience follows them. From which he
  concluded, that the Pope being a Party, and having already passed his
  Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in things which ought to be examined by a General Council, could not
  be a Judge, nor sit in it. Princes also, who upon a common mistake, thinking
  the Pope Head of the Church, had sworn to him, finding that this was done upon
  a false ground, may pull their Neck out of his Yoke, as every man may make his
  escape out of the hands of a Robber. And the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was so
  corrupt, that a Pope, though he mean't well, as <hi>Hadrian</hi> did, yet could
  never bring any good design to an issue; the Cardinals and the rest of that
  Court being so engaged to maintain their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>

            <p> These were the Heads of that Discourse, which it seems he gave

in their Sees, and of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Christian Prince to make them do their
duty; but that I could never see, and I am afraid it is lost.</p>
            <p>All this I thought necessary to open, to show the State of the

his own Dominions. But though matters were carryed in Publick Assemblies
smoothly and successfully, yet there were many secret discontents, which being
fomented, both by the Pope, and the Emperors Agents, wrought him great trouble;
so that the rest of his life, was full of vexation and disquiet.</p>
            <p>All that were zealously addicted to that which they called the Old
Religion, did conclude, that what-ever firmness the King expressed to it now,
was either pretended out of Policy, for avoiding the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, which the
fears of a Change might produce: or though he really intended to perform what
he professed; yet the Interests in which he must embarque, with the Princess of
<hi>Germany</hi> against the Pope and the Emperor, together with the Power that
the Queen had over him, and the credit <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Crom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell</hi> had with him, would prevail on
him to change some things in Religion. And they look'd on these things, as so
complicated together, that the change of any one must needs make way for change
in more, since that struck at the Authority of the Church, and left people at
liberty to dispute the Articles of Faith. This they thought was a Gate opened 
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104314:111"/> to Heresie. And therefore they were every-where meeting
together, and consulting, what should be done for suppressing Heresie, and
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Catholick Faith.</p>
            <p>That zeal was much inflamed by the Monks and Friers, who clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
saw the Acts of Parliament,<note place="margin">By the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises of the Monks
  and Friars.</note> were so levelled at their Exemptions and Immunities, that
they were now like to be at the Kings mercy. They were no more to plead their
Bulls, nor claim any Priviledges, further than it pleased the King to allow
them. No new Saints from <hi>Rome</hi> could draw more Riches or Honour to
their Orders. Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Indulgences were out of doors; so that the Arts
of drawing in the people, to enrich their Churches and Houses, were at an end.
And they had also secret Intimations, that the King and the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, had an
eye on their Lands, and they gave themselves for lost, if they could not so
embroyl the Kings Affairs, that he should not adventure on so invidious a
thing: Therefore both in Confessions and Conferences, they infused into the
people a dislike of the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; which though for some time it did
not break out into an open Rebellion, yet the humor still fermented, and people
only waited for an opportunity: So that if the Emperor had not been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
distracted, he might have made War upon the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with great Advantages.
For many of his discontented Subjects, would have joyned with the Enemy. But
the King did so dextrously ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his Leagues with the <hi>French</hi> King,
and the Princes of the Empire, that the Emperor could never make any
impressions on his Dominions.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the King to great
  severities.</note>But those factious Spirits, seeing nothing was to be expected
from any forreign Power, could not contain themselves, but broke out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open
Rebellion. And this provoked the King to great severities; His Spirit was so
fretted, by the tricks the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had put on him, and by the
Ingratitude and seditious practises of <hi>Reginald Pool</hi>; that he thereby
lost much of his former temper and patience, and was too ready upon slight
grounds, to bring his Subjects to the Bar. Where though the matter was always
so ordered, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law they were Endicted and Judged; yet the
severity of the Law bordering sometimes on rigor and cruelty, he came to be
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a cruel Tyrant. Nor did his severity lie only on one side: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
addicted to some Tenets of the Old Religion; and impatient of Contradiction, or
perhaps blown up, either with the vanity of his new Title, of <hi>Head of the
Church,</hi> or with the praises which Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers bestowed on him; he thought
all persons were bound, to regulate their Belief by his Dictates, which made
him prosecute Protestants, as well as proceed against Papists. Yet it does not
appear, that Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty was Natural to him. For in Twenty five years Reign, none
had suffered for any Crime against the State; but <hi>Pool</hi> Earl of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> The
former he prosecuted in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Fathers last Commands at his death.
His severity to the other was imputed to the <hi>Cardinals</hi> Malice. The
Proceedings were also legal. And the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> had by the
knavery of a Priest, to whom he gave great credit, been made believe he had a
Right to the Crown; and practises of that nature, touch Princes so nearly, that
no wonder the Law was executed in such a case. This <pb n="181" facs="tcp:104314:111"/>
showes, that the King was not very jealous, nor desirous of the Blood of his
Subjects. But though he always proceeded upon Law; yet in the last Ten years of
his Life, many instances of Severity occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for which he is rather to be
pityed, than either imitated or sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censured.</p>
            <p>The former Book was full of Intrigues and forreign Transactions;
the greatest part of it being an account of a tedious Negotiation, with the
subtlest and most refined Court in Christendome, in all the Arts of humane
Policy. But now my work is confined to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and except in short
touches by the way, I shall meddle no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Mysteries of State; but
shall give as clear an account of those things that relate to Religion and
Reformation, as I could possibly recover. The Suppression of Monasteries, The
advance and declension of Reformation, and the Proceedings against those, who
adhered to the Interests of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> must be the chief
Subjects of this Book. The two former shall be opened, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of time
as they were Transacted. But the last shall be left to the end of the Book,
that it may be presented in one full view.</p>
            <p>After the Parliament had ended their Business,<note place="margin">The Bishops swear the Kings supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</note> the Bishops did
all renew their Allegeance to the King, and swore also to maintain his
Supremacy in Ecclesiastical Matters; acknowledging that he was the Supreme Head
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though there was yet no Law for the
requiring of any such Oath. The first act of the Kings Supremacy was, his
naming <hi>Cromwell</hi> Vicar-General, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Visitor of all the
Monasteries and other Priviledged places. This is commonly confounded with his
following Dignity of, <hi>Lord Vice-Gerent</hi> in Ecclesiastical matters; but
they were two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Places, and held by different Commissions. By the one
he had no Authority over the Bishops, nor had he any Precedence; but the other,
as it gave him the Precedence next the Royal Family, so it cloathed him with a
compleat Delegation of the Kings whole Power in Ecclesiastical Affairs. For Two
years he was only Vicar-General. But the tenour of his Commissions, and the
nature of the Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved on him by them, cannot be fully known. For
neither the one, nor the other are in the Rolls, though there can be no doubt
made, but Commissions of such Importance were enrolled; therefore the loss of
them can only be charged, on that search and rasure of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords made by
<hi>Bonner,</hi> upon the Commission granted to him by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> of
which I have spoken in the Preface of this work. In the
<hi>Prerogative-Office</hi> there is a subalterne Commission granted to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
(afterwards Secretary) <hi>Petre,</hi> on <hi>Ian.</hi> 13. in the Twenty
Seventh year of the Kings Reign, by which it appears, that <hi>Cromwells</hi>
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was at first conceived in very General words, for he is called the
Kings <hi>Vice-Gerent,</hi> in Ecclesiastical causes, his
<hi>Vicar-General,</hi> and <hi>Official-Principal.</hi> But because he could
not himself attend upon all these affairs, therefore Doctor <hi>Petre</hi> is
deputed under him, for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Probates of Wills; from thence likewise
it appears, that all Wills, where the Estate was 200 lib. or above, were no
more to be tryed or proved in the Bishops Courts, but in the
<hi>Vicar-Generals</hi> Court. Yet though he was called <hi>Vice-Gerent</hi> in
that Commission, he was spoken of, and writ to, by the Name of
<hi>Vicar-General</hi>; but <pb n="182" facs="tcp:104314:112"/> after the second Commission,
seen and mentioned by the Lord <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1536. he was

               </note> In
<hi>Oxford</hi> the Question being put whether the Pope had any other
Jurisdiction in <hi>England,</hi> than any other forreign Bishop, it was
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Thirty Doctors and Batchelors, who were impowered to set the
University-Seal to their Conclusion, they all agreed in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and the
whole University being examined about it man by man assented to their
determination. All the difficulty that I find made, was at <hi>Richmond,</hi>
by the <hi>Franciscan Friers,</hi> where the Bishop of <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> and
<hi>Lichfield (Rowland Lee)</hi> and <hi>Thomas Bedyl,</hi> tendred some
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions to them, among which, this was one. <hi>That the Pope if</hi>
Rome, <hi>has no greater jurisdiction in this Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>by
the Law of God, than any other Forreign Bishop.</hi> This they told them was
alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy subscribed, by the two Arch-Bishops, the Bishops of <hi>London,
Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, Duresm, Bath,</hi> and all the other Prelates, and Heads of
Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and all the famous Clerks of the Realm. And therefore they desired
that the Friers, would refer the matter, to the Four Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the House, and
acquiesce in what they should do. But the Friers said, it concerned their
Consciences, and therefore they would not submit it to a small part of their
House, they added, that they had sworn to follow the Rule of St.
<hi>Francis,</hi> and in that they would live and dy; and cited a Chapter of
their Rule, 
<q>That their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der should have a Cardinal for their Protector, by
  whose dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they might be governed in their obedience to the Holy
  See.</q> But to this the Bishop answered, That St. <hi>Francis</hi> lived in
<hi>Italy,</hi> where the Monks and other Regulars that had Exemptions, were
subject to the Pope, as they were in <hi>England,</hi> to the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> And for the Chapter which they cited, it was showed them,
that it was not written by St. <hi>Francis,</hi> but made since his time; and
though it were truly a part of his Rule, it was told them that no particular
Rule, ought to be preferred to the Laws of the Land, to which all Subjects were
bound to give Obedience, and could not be excused from it, by any voluntary
Obligation under which they brought themselves. Yet all this could not prevail
on them, but they said to the Bishop, they had professed St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s
Rule, and would still continue in the Observance of it.</p>
            <p>But though I do not find such resistance made elsewhere, yet it
appears, that some secret practises of many of those Orders against the State
were discovered,<note place="margin">A General vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation of Monasteries, is
  designed.</note> therefore it was resolved, that some effectual means, must be
taken for lessening their credit and Authority with the people; and so a
general Visitation of all Monasteries and other Religious Houses was resolved
on. This was chiefly advised, by Doctor <hi>Leigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Orig. <hi>Cott.</hi> Lib. E. 4.</note> who had been in the
Cardinals service with <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and was then taken notice of by him,
as a dextrous and diligent man, and therefore was now made use of on this
Occasion. He by a Letter to <hi>Cromwell</hi> advertised him, that upon a long
Conference with the Dean of the <hi>Arches,</hi> he found the Dean was of
Opinion, that it was not fit to make any Visitation in the Kings name yet, for
Two or <pb n="183" facs="tcp:104314:112"/> Three years, till his Supremacy were better
received; and that he apprehended a severe Visitation so early, would make the
Clergy more averse to the Kings Power. But <hi>Leighton</hi> on the other hand,
thought nothing would so much recommend the Supremacy, as to see such good
effects of it, as might follow upon a strict and exact Visitation. And the
Abuses of Religious persons were now so great and visible, even to the Laity,
That the Correcting and Reforming these, would be a very popular thing. He writ
further, That there had been no Visitation in the Northern parts, since the
Cardinal Ordered it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he advised one, and desired to be employed in
<hi>York-shire.</hi> And by another Letter, dated the 4th of <hi>Iune,</hi> he
wrote to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> desiring, that Doctor <hi>Lee,</hi> and he, might
be imployed in Visiting all the Monasteries, from the Diocess of
<hi>Lincoln</hi> Northwards; which they could Manage better, than any body
else, having great kindred, and a large acquaintance in those parts: so that
they would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to discover, all the disorders or seditious practises in
these Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. He complained, that former Visitations had been slight and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant, and promised great faithfulness and diligence both from himself
and Doctor <hi>Lee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was now making his

that according to the Custom, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of his Metropolitical See,
he might make his Visitation; The King granted him Licence to do it, and
required all to assist and obey him; dated the 28th of <hi>April.</hi> Things
were not yet ripe for doing great matters; so that which he now look'd to,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rot. Pat.</hi> Regn. 26. Part. 1st.</note> was to see that all
should submit to the Kings Supremacy; and renounce any dependance on the Pope,
whose name was to be struck out of all the Publick Offices of the Church. This
was begun in <hi>May</hi> 1535. <hi>Stokesly</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi>
submitted not to this Visitation,<note place="margin">Regist. <hi>Stoks,</hi>

Priviledges.</p>
            <p>In <hi>October,</hi> began the great Visitation of Monasteries,
which was committed to several Commissioners. <hi>Leighton,</hi>

               <hi>Lee</hi> and

and enrolled, have been taken out of the Rolls; for there are none of them to
be found there. Yet I encline to think, they were not under the great
Seal.<note place="margin">In MSS. D<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> G. <hi>Pierpoint.</hi>
               </note> For I
have seen an Original Commission for the Visitation, that was next year, which

the Commissions this year, were of the same nature: yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such

for these things. So what their Power was, I am not able to discover. But
besides their Powers and Commissions, they got Instructions to direct them in
their Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Injunctions to be left in every House, of which, though

  <hi>Numb.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi>
                  </note>) and they should teach the people, that the
Kings Power was Supreme on Earth, under God, and that the Bishop of

and Decretals, which had been long tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Prince, but was now justly
taken away.</p> 
               <p> The Abbot and Brethren were declared to be absolved from any
Oath, they had Sworn to the Pope, or to any Forreign Potentate; and the Satutes
of any Order, that did bind them to a Forreign Subjection, were abrogated and
ordered to be razed out of their Books.</p> 
               <p> That no Monk should go out of the precinct, nor any woman enter
within it, without leave from the King or the Visitor, and that there should be

               <p> Some Rules were given about their Meals, and a Chapter of the Old

be served with common Meats, and not with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and strange Dishes; and
either he, or one of the Seniors, were to be always there to entertain
strangers.</p> 
               <p> Some other Rules follow about the distribution of their Alms,
their accommodation in Health and Sickness. One or two of every House, was to
be kept at the University; that when they were well Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they might

the Rule, and apply it according to Christ's Law; and to shew them, that their
Ceremonies were but Elements, introductory to true Christianity; and that
Religion consisted not in Habits, or in such like Rites, but in cleanness of
Heart, pureness of Living, unfeigned Faith, Brotherly Charity, and true
honouring of God in Spirit and Truth: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must not rest in

               </note> to offer him some short
view of the Rise and Progress of Monastick Orders in <hi>England,</hi> and of
the state they were in at this time. What the Ancient <hi>British</hi> Monks
were, or by what Rule they were Governed; whether it was from the Eastern
Churches, that this Constitution was brought into <hi>Britain,</hi> and was
either suited to the Rule of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> St. <hi>Pachon,</hi> or St.
<hi>Basil</hi>; or whether they had it from <hi>France,</hi> where
<hi>Sulpitius</hi> tells us, St. <hi>Martin</hi> set up Monasteries, must be
left to conjecture. But from the little that remains of them, we find they were
very numerous, and were obedient to the Bishop of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> as all the
Monks of the Primitive times were to their Bishops, according to the Canons of
the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But upon the confusions which the <hi>Gothick</hi> Wars brought

                  </gap>edict</hi> and
others set up Religious Houses; and more artificial Rules and Methods were
found out for their Government. Not long after that, <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk
came into <hi>England</hi>; and having Baptized <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> he
perswaded him to Found a Monastery at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which the King,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
               </note> by his Charter, exempted
from the Jurisdiction of the Arch-Bishop and his Successors. This was not only
done by <hi>Austins</hi> consent, but he by another Writing confirms this
Foundation; and exempted both the Monastery and all the Churches belonging to
it, from his, or his Successors Jurisdictions; and most earnestly conjures his
Successors, never to give any trouble to the Monks, who were only to be subject
to their own Abbot. And this was granted, that they might have no disturbance
in the Service of God. But (whether this, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ancient Foundations,
were not latter Forgeries, which I vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently suspect, I leave to Criticks to
discuss) the next Exemption, that I find, was granted in the year 680, to the
Abby of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> by Pope <hi>Agatho,</hi> and was Signed by
<hi>Theodore,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> called the Popes Legate
(this I doubt was Forged afterwards.) In the year 725, King <hi>Ina</hi>'s
Charter to the Abbey of <hi>Glassenbury,</hi> relates to their Ancient
Charters, and exempts them from the Bishops Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. King <hi>Offa</hi>
Founded, and exempted the Monastery of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> 
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:104314:115"/> in the year 793, which Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the 3d
Confirmed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1218, <hi>Kenulph</hi> King of <hi>Mercia</hi> founded
and exempted <hi>Abington,</hi> in the year 821. <hi>Knut</hi> Founded and

            <p>About the end of the Eighth Century, the <hi>Danes</hi> began to
make their descents into <hi>England,</hi> and made every-where great
depredations;<note place="margin">Monasteries generally wasted and

               </note> that they were generally abandon'd by the Monks, who
as they loved the ease and wealth they had enjoyed formerly in their Houses, so
had no mind to expose themselves, to the persecutions of those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
Invaders. But when they had deserted their Seats, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Clergy came and
possessed them; so that in King <hi>Edgars</hi> time, there was scarce a Monk
in all <hi>England.</hi>
               <note place="margin">But are again set up by King
  <hi>Edgar.</hi>
               </note> He was a most dissolute and lewd Prince, but being
perswaded by <hi>Dunstan</hi> and other Monks, that what he did towards the
restoring of that decayed State, would be a matter of great Merit, became the
great Promoter of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastical State in <hi>England</hi>; For he converted
most of the Chapters into Monasteries; and by his Foundation of the Priory of
<hi>Worcester,</hi> it appears, he had then founded no fewer then Fourty Seven,
which he intended to encrease to Fifty, <hi>the number of Pardon.</hi> Yet in
his Foundations, he only exempted the Monasteries, from all exactions or dues,
which the Bishops claim'd. There are Exemptions of several rates and sizes:
Some Houses were only Exempted from all Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; others from all
Jurisdiction or Visitations; others had only an Exemption for their precinct;
others for all the Churches that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them. <hi>Edward</hi> the
Confessor exempted many of these Houses, which <hi>Edgar</hi> had founded, as
<hi>Ramsey</hi> &amp;c. He also founded and Exempted <hi>Coventry</hi> and
<hi>Westminster,</hi> and the Exemption of the last, was likewise confirmed by
Pope <hi>Nicolas,</hi> in a Bull to King <hi>Edward. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the
Conqueror Founded and Exempted the Abbey of <hi>Battel</hi> from all Episcopal
Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>But after that time I do not find, that our Kings exempted Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys
from any thing, but Episcopal Exactions; for though former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kings had made
Laws, and given Orders about Ecclesiastical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet now the claim to an
Immunity from the Civil Jurisdiction, and also the Papal Authority, were grown
to that height, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were to meddle no more with sacred things. And
henceforth all Exemptions were granted by the Popes, who claimed a Jurisdiction
over the whole Church; and assumed that Power to themselves with many other
Usurpations.</p>
            <p>All the Ancient Foundations were subscribed by the King,<note place="margin">Arts used by the Monks for enriching their Houses.</note> the
Queen, and Prince, with many Bishops and Abbots, and Dukes and Earls
consenting. The Abbeys being exempted from all jurisdiction, both Civil and
Spiritual, and from all Impositions; and having gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Priviledge of
Sanctuary for all that fled to them, were at ease, and accountable to none, so
they might do what they pleased. They found also means to enrich themselves,
First by the belief of Purgatory. For they perswaded all people, that the Souls
departed, <pb n="188" facs="tcp:104314:116"/> went generally thither; few were so Holy, as
to go straight to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and few so bad, as to be cast to Hell. Then people
were made believe, that the saying of Masses for their Souls, gave them great
relief in their Torments, and did at length deliver them out of them. This
being generally received, it was thought by all a piece of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their
Parents, and of necessary care for themselves, and their families, to give some
part of their Estates towards the enriching of these Houses, for having a Mass
said every day for the Souls of their Ancestors, and for their own, after their
death. And this did so spread, that if some Laws had not restrained their
profuseness, the greater part of all the Estates in <hi>England,</hi> had been
given to those Houses. But the Statutes of <hi>Mortmain</hi> were not very
effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains; for what King soever had refused to grant a
<hi>Mortmain,</hi> was sure to have an uneasie reign ever after.</p>
            <p>Yet this did not satisfie the Monks, but they fell upon other
contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, to get the best of all mens Jewels, Plate, and Furniture. For
they perswaded them, that the protection and intercession of Saints, were of
mighty use to them; so that whatsoever respect they put on the Shrines and
Images, but chiefly on the Relicks of Saints, they would find their account in
it, and the Saints would take it kindly at their hands, and intercede the more
earnestly for them. And peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who saw Courtiers much wrought on by presents,
imagined the Saints were of the same temper; only with this difference, that
Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers love to have Presents put in their own hands, but the Saints were
satisfied, if they were given to others. And as in the Courts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the
new Favourite commonly had greatest credit, so every new Saint was believed to
have a greater force in his Addresses; and therefore every body was to run to
their Shrines, and make great Presents to them. This being infused into the
credulous Multitude, they brought the richest things they had, to the places
where the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or Relicks of those Saints were laid. Some Images were also
believed, to have a peculiar Excellencie in them; and Pilgrimages and Presents
to these, were much magnified. But to quicken all this, the Monks found the
means, either by dreams and visions, or strange Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous stories, to feed
the devotion of the people. Relicks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number, were every-where
discovered; and most wonderful rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Martyrdome, and other miracles
of the Saints, were made and read in all places to the people; and new
Improvements were daily made in a Trade, that through the craft of the Monks,
and the simplicity of the people, brought in great advantages. And though there
was enough got to enrich them all, yet there was strange rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, not only
among the several Orders, but the Houses of the same Order. The Monks,
especially, of <hi>Glassenbury,</hi> St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and St.
<hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundsbury,</hi> vied one with another, who could tell the most
extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant stories, for the honour of their House, and of the Relicks in
it.</p>
            <p>The Monks in these Houses abounding in wealth, and living at
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase and in idleness,<note place="margin">They became generally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</note> did so degenerate, that
from the Twelfth Century downward, their reputation abated much; and the
Priviledges of Sanctuaries, were a general Grievance, and oft complained of in
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments: For they received all that fled to them, which put a great stop
to Justice, and did encourage the most criminal offenders. They 
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104314:116"/> became lewd and dissolute, and so impudent in it, that
some of their farms were let, for bringing in a yearly tribute to their Lusts:
nor did they keep Hospitality and relieve the poor; but rather encouraged
Vagabonds and Beggars, against whom Laws were made, both in <hi>Edward</hi> the
3d, King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, and this Kings Reign.</p>
            <p>But from the Twelfth Century,<note place="margin">Upon which the
  Begging Friars grew much in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</note> the Orders of Begging Friers were
set up, and they by the appearance of Severity and Mortification, gained great
esteem. At first they would have nothing, no real e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, but the ground on
which their House stood. But afterwards distinctions were found, for satisfying
their Consciences in larger Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions. They were not so idle and lazy as the
Monks, but went about and Preached, and heard Confessions, and carryed about
Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, with many other pretty little things, <hi>Agnus Del</hi>'s,
<hi>Rosaries,</hi> and <hi>Pebles,</hi> which they made the World believe, had
great vertue in them. And they had the esteem of the people, wholly engrossed
to themselves. They were also more formidable to Princes, than the Monks,
because they were poorer, and by consequence, more hardy and bold. There was
also a firmer union of their whole Order, they having a General at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and being divided into many Provinces, subject to their
Provincials. They had likewise the <hi>Schooll-Learning</hi> wholly in their
hands, and were great Preachers, so that many things concurred, to raise their
esteem with the people very high, yet great Complaints lay against them, for
they went more abroad than the Monks did, and were believed guilty of
Corrupting Families. The Scandals that went on them, upon their relaxing the
primitive strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Orders, were a little rectified by some
Reformations of these Orders. But that lasted not long; for they became liable
to much Censure, and many visitations had been made, but to little purpose.
This Concurring with their secret practices against the King, both in the
matter of his Divorce and Supremacy, made him more willing to examine the truth
of these reports; that if they were found guilty of such scandals, they might
lose their credit with the people, and occasions be ministred to the King, to
justifie the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of them.</p>
            <p>There were also two other Motives, that enclined the King to this
Counsel. The one was,<note place="margin">The Kings secret motives for
  dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> that he apprehended a War from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
who was then the only Prince in the World, that had any considerable force at
Sea; having both great Fleets in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and being Prince of the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> where the greatest trade of these parts was driven.
Therefore the King judged it necessary to fortifie his Ports, and seeing the
great advantages of Trade, which began then to rise much, was resolved to
encourage it: For which end he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to build many Havens and Harbors. This
was a matter of great charge, and as his own revenue could not defray it, so he
had no mind to lay heavie Taxes on his Subjects, therefore the Suppression of
Monasteries, was thought, the easiest way of raising Money.</p>
            <p>He also intended to erect many more Bishopricks, to which
<hi>Cranmer</hi> advised him much, that the vastness of some Diocesses, being
reduced to a narrower compass, Bishops might better discharge their duties, and
oversee their Flocks, according to the Scriptures and the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Rules.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:104314:117"/>But <hi>Cranmer</hi> did on another reason,
press the Suppression of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries. He found that their Foundations, and
whole State, was inconsistent with a full and true Reformation.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>anmers</hi>
  de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in it.</note> For among the things to be reform'd, were these Abuses,
which were essential to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution; (such as the Belief of Purgatory,
of Redeeming Souls by Masses, the worship of Saints and Images, and
Pilgrimages, and the like.) And therefore those Societies, whose interest it
was to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Reformation, were once to be suppressed: and then he hoped,
upon new Endowments and Foundations, new Houses should have been erected at
every Cathedral, to be Nurseries for that whole Diocess; which he thought would
be more suitable, to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive use of Monasteries, and more profitable to
the Church. This was his Scheme, as will afterwards appear; which was in some
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure effected, though not so fully as he projected, for Reasons to be told
in their proper place.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">First Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery that was
  dissolved.</note>There had been a Bull sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> for dissolving
some Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and Erecting Bishopricks out of them, as was related in the
former Book, in the year 1532. And it seems it was upon that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that
in the year 1533. the Priory of Christs Church near <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> in
<hi>London,</hi> was dissolved, and given to the Lord Chancellor Sir <hi>Thomas
Audley</hi>; (not to make him speak shriller for his Master in the House of
Commons, as <hi>Fuller</hi> mistakes it; for he had been Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor a
year before this was given him.) The Popes Authority not being at that time put
down, nor the Kings Supremacy set up, I conjecture it was done, pursuant to the
Bull for the Dissolution of some Religious Houses; but I never saw the
Dissolution, and so can only guess,<note place="margin">Act. 10. <hi>Rot. Parl.

the former year, in which the Kings Grant of that House, to the Lord Chancellor
was confirmed, it is said in the Preamble, 
<q>That the Prior and Convent, had resigned that House to the King
  the 24th of <hi>February</hi> 23d <hi>Regni.</hi> and had left their House;

               <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Visitors.</note>But now
I come to Consider, how the Visitors carryed on their Visitations. Many severe
things are said of their Proceedings, nor is it any wonder, that men who had

esteemed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of their Ruin,<note place="margin">

<hi>Cromwell</hi> it appears, that in most Houses, they found Monstrous
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. That many fell down on their knees, and prayed they might be
discharged, since they had been forced to make vows against their wills; with
these the Visitors dispensed, and set them at liberty. They found great
Factions in the Houses, and Barbarous Cruelties exercis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one Faction,
against another, as either of them prevailed. In many places, when they gave
them the Kings injunctions, many cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, that the severity of them was
intolerable, and they desired rather to be suppressed, than so reformed. They
were all extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted to Idolatry and Superstition. In some they found
the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, and other tools for multiplying and coyning.</p>
            <p>But for the Lewdness of the Confessors of Nunneries, and the great
Corruption of that State, whole Houses being found almost all with Child; for
the dissoluteness of Abbots and the other Monks and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, 
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104314:117"/> not only with whores, but Marryed Women; and for their
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Lusts and other brutal practices; these are not fit to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, much less enlarged on, in a work of this Nature. The full report of this

found his whore with him; and in the Abbots Coffer, there was an habit for her,
for she went for a young Brother. Whether the shame of this discovery, or any
other consideration prevailed with him, I know not; but on the 13th of
<hi>November,</hi> he, and Ten Monks Signed a Resignation, which hath an odd
kind of Preamble, to be found in the Collection. 
<q>It sayes, that the revenue of the House, was so much endamaged,
  and engaged in so much debt,<note place="margin">

  ruined, both as to its Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal concerns; therefore they
  surrender up their House to the King.</q> They were of the Order of
<hi>Premonstre,</hi> and their House was dedicated, to the honor of the Blessed
Virgin, and St. <hi>Thomas Becket.</hi> This precedent was followed, by the

<hi>Kent.</hi> But neither among the Original Surrenders, nor in the Clause
Rolls, are there any other Deeds, in this year of our Lord, there are indeed in
the same year of the King, (which runs till <hi>April</hi> 1536.) four other
Surrenders, with the same Preambles. Of <hi>Merton</hi> in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
a Covent of <hi>Augustinians,</hi> signed by the Prior and Five Monks, the 9th
of <hi>February,</hi> of <hi>Bilsingtoun</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> Signed by the

Monks, and of <hi>Hornby</hi> in <hi>York-shire,</hi> a Covent of the
<hi>Premonstre,</hi> Signed by the Prior and Two Monks the 23d of
<hi>March.</hi> These were all the Surrenders, that I can discover to have been
made, before the Act of Parliament, for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the lesser Monasteries,
passed in the next Session that was assembled in <hi>February.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before that, the afflicted and unfortunate Queen
<hi>Katharine</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at <hi>Kimbolton</hi>; She had been much
disquieted,<note place="margin">1536.</note> because she would not lay down her
Title of Queen.<note place="margin">The death of Queen
  <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine.</hi>
               </note> Many of her servants were put from her, on that
account; but she would accept of no Service, from any that did not use her as a
Queen, and call her so. The King sent oft to her, to perswade her, to more
Complyance. But she stood her ground, and said, since the Pope had judged her
Marriage good,<note place="margin">Originals. <hi>Otho.</hi> C. 10.
  <hi>Cott.</hi> Lib.</note> she would lose her life, before she did any thing in
prejudice of it. She became more cheerful, than she had wont to be; and the
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people came much to her, whom she received, and used very Obligingly.
The King had a mind she should go to <hi>Fotheringhay</hi>-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104314:118"/> But when it was proposed to her, she plainly said, she
would never go thither, unless she were carryed as a Prisoner, bound with
Ropes. She desired leave to come nearer <hi>London</hi>; but that was not
granted. She had the jointure that was assigned her, as <hi>Princess
Dowager</hi>; and was treated with the respect due to that Dignity, but all the
Women about her, still called her Queen. I do not find she had any thoughts of
going out of <hi>England</hi>; though her Life in it was but Melancholy. Yet
her care to support her Daughters Title, made her bear all the Disgraces, she
lay under. The Officious and practising Clergy, that were for the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> look'd on her as the Head of their Party, and asserted her
Interests much. Yet she was so watched, that she could not hold any great
Correspondence with them; though in the matter of the Maid of <hi>Kent,</hi>
she had some Medling.</p>
            <p>When she sicken'd, she made her Will; and appointed her Body to be
buryed, in a Convent of Observant Friars, (who had done and suffered most for
her;) and Ordered Five Hundred Masses to be said for her Soul; and that one
should go a Pilgrimage, to our Lady of <hi>Walsingham,</hi> and give Two
Hundred Nobles by the way to the poor. Some other small Legacies, she left to
her Servants. When the King heard she was sick, he sent a kind Message to her;
and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Ambassador went to see her, and to chear her up, but when she
found her sickness like to prove Mortal; she made one about her, write a Letter
in her name, to the King. In the Title she call'd him, 
<q>
                  <hi>Her dear Lord, King and Husband.</hi> She advised him to
  look to the health of his Soul. She forgave him, all the Troubles he had cast
  her into. She recommended their Daughter <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> to him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired he would be a Loving Father
  to her. She also desired, that he would provide Matches for her Maids, who were
  but Three; and that he would give her Servants one years Wages, more than was
  due to them And Concluded lastly, <hi>I make this Vow, That mine eyes desire
  you above all things.</hi>
               </q> By another Letter, she recommended her Daughter
to the Emperors care. On the 8th of <hi>Ianuary</hi> she dyed, in the Fiftyeth
year of her Age, Thirty Three years after she came to <hi>England.</hi> She was
a devout and pious Princess, and led a severe and mortified Life. In her
Greatness, she wrought much with her own hands, and kept her Women, well
employed about her; as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the Two Legates came once to speak with
her. She came out to them with a Skein of silk about her Neck, and told them,
she had been within, at work with her Women. She was most pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
devoted, to the Interests of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they being so
interwoven with her own. And in a word, she is represented as a most wonderful
good Woman. Only I find on many occasions, that the King complained much, of
her uneasiness and peevishness. But whether the fault was in her humor, or in
the Provocations, she met with, the Reader may conjecture. The King received
the news of her death, with some regrett. But he would not give leave to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
her, as she had ordered; but made her body be laid in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey Church of
<hi>Peterborough,</hi> which he afterwards Converted to an Episcopal Cathedral.
But Queen <hi>Anne</hi> did not carry her death so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently; for she express'd
too much joy at it, both in her Carriage and dress.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:104314:118"/>On the 4th of <hi>February</hi> the
Parliament sate,<note place="margin">1536.</note> upon a Prorogation of 14th
Months, (for in the Record there is no mention of any intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Prorogation,) where a great many Laws, relating to Civil concerns,<note place="margin">A new Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> were passed. By the 15th
Act, the Power that had been given by a former Act to the King, for naming
thirty two Persons, to make a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Ecclesiastical Laws, was again
confirmed; for nothing had been done upon the former Act. But there was no
limitation of time in this Act, and so there was nothing done in pursuance of
it.</p>
            <p>The great business of this Session of Parliament,<note place="margin">The lesser Monasteries are suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> was the
suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the lesser Monasteries. How this went thorough the two Houses, we
cannot know from the Journals, for they are lost. But all the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians of
that time, tell us, that the report which the Visitors made to the King, was
read in Parliament; which represented the manners of these Houses so odiously,
that the Act was easily carried. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble bears, 
<q>That small Religious Houses, under the number of twelve Persons,
  had been long and notoriously guilty of vicious and abominable Living; and did
  much consume and waste, their Churches, Lands, and other things belonging to
  them; and that for above two hundred years, there had been many Visitations for
  reforming these Abuses, but with no success; their vicious living encreasing
  daily: So that except small Houses were dissolved, and the Religious put into
  greater Monasteries, there could no Reformation be expected in that matter.
  Whereupon the King having received a full infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of these Abuses, both by
  his Visitors and other credible ways; and considering that there were divers
  great Monasteries, in which Religion was well kept and observed, which had not
  the full number in them, that they might and ought to receive, had made a full
  Declaration of the Premisses in Parliament. Whereupon it was Enacted, That all
  Houses which might spend yearly 200 <hi>l.</hi> or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, should be
  suppressed, and their Revenues converted to better uses, and they compelled to
  reform their Lives.</q> The Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> thinks it strange, that the
Statute in the printed Book, has no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, but begins bluntly.
<hi>Fuller</hi> tell us, that he wonders, that Lord did not see the Record; and
he sets down the Preamble, and says, <hi>The rest follow as in the printed
Statute, Chap.</hi> 27th. by a mistake for the 28th. This shews, that neither
the one, nor the other, ever look'd on the Record. For there is a particular
Statute of Dissolution, distinct from the 28th Chap. And the Preamble which
<hi>Fuller</hi> sets down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to the 28th Chapter, as he says, but to
the 18th Chapter, which was never printed: and the 28th relates in the
Preamble, to that other Statute, which had given these Monasteries to the
King.</p>
            <p>The reasons, that were pretended for dissolving these Houses,
were:<note place="margin">Reasons for doing it.</note> That whereas there was but
a small number of persons in them, they entred into Confederacies together, and
their Poverty set them on, to use many ill arts to grow Rich. They were also
much abroad, and kept no manner of Discipline in their Houses. But those Houses
were generally much richer, than they seemed to be: For the Abbots raising
great Fines out of them, held the Leases still low; and by that means they were
not obliged to entertain a greater number in their House, and so enriched
themselves and their Brethren by the Fines that were raised: For many Houses
then rented at two hundred pounds, <pb n="194" facs="tcp:104314:119"/> were worth many
thousands, as will appear to any that compares, what they were then valued at,
(which is Collected by <hi>Speed,</hi>) with what their Estates are truely
worth. When this was passing in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Stokesl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London</hi> said, 
<q>These lesser Houses were as Thorns soon pluck't up, but the
  great Abbots were like putrified old Oaks; yet they must needs follow, and so
  would others do in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, before many years were passed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By another Act, all these Houses, their Churches, Lands, and all
their Goods were given to the King, and his Heirs and Successors, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with all other Houses, which within a year before the making of the Act, had
been dissolved or suppressed: And for the gathering the Revenues that belonged
to them, a new Court was Erected, called the Court of the <hi>Augmentations of
the Kings Revenue</hi>; which was to consist of a Chancellor, a Treasurer, an
Attourney and Sollicitor, and ten Auditors, seventeen Receivers, a Clerk, an
Usher, and a Messenger. This Court was to bring in the Revenues of such Houses
as were now dissolved, excepting only such as the King by his Letters-Patents,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their former state, appointing a Seal for the Court, with full
Power and Authority to dispose of these Lands so as might be most for the Kings
Service.</p>
            <p>Thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell the lesser
Abbeys, to the number of 376, and soon after, this Parliament, which had done
the King such eminent Service, and had now sate six years, was dissolved, on
the 14th of <hi>April.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Convocation, a motion was made of great consequence; That
there should be a Translation of the Bible in <hi>English,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of the Bible in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
  designed.</note> to be set up in all the Churches of <hi>England.</hi> The
Clergy, when they procured <hi>Tindalls</hi> Translation to be condemned, and
suppressed it, gave out that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make a Translation into the
Vulgar-Tongue: Yet it was afterwards, upon a long Consultation, Resolved, that
it was free for the Church to give the Bible in a Vulgar-Tongue, or not, as
they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and that the King was not obliged to it, and that at that time
it was not at all expedient to do it. Upon which, those that promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the
Reformation, made great complaints, and said, it was visible, the Clergy knew
there was an opposition between the Scriptures and their Doctrine. That they
had first condemned <hi>Wickliffs</hi> Translation, and then <hi>Tindalls</hi>;
and though they ought to teach men the Word of God, yet they did all they could
to suppress it.</p>
            <p>In the times of the Old Testament, the Scriptures were writ in the
Vulgar-Tongue, and all were charged to read and remember the Law.<note place="margin">The reasons for it.</note> The Apostles wrote in Greek, which was
then the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Language in the World. Christ did also appeal to the
Scriptures, and sent the people to them. And by what St. <hi>Paul</hi> says of
<hi>Timothy,</hi> it appears, that children were then early trained up in that
study. In the Primitive Church, as Nations were converted to the Faith, the
Bible was Translated into their Tongue. The Latine Translation was very
Ancient; the Bible was afterwards put into the <hi>Scythian, Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
and <hi>Gothick</hi> Tongues. It continued thus for several Ages, till the
state of Monkery rose; And then, when they engrossed the riches, and the Popes
assumed the Dominion of the World, it was not consistent with these Designs,
nor with the Arts used to promote them, to let the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be much known:
Therefore Legends and strange stories of Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <pb n="195" facs="tcp:104314:119"/> with
other devices, were thought more proper for keeping up their Credit, and
carrying on their Ends.</p>
            <p>It was now generally desired, that if there were just exceptions
against what <hi>Tindal</hi> had done, these might be amended in a New
Translation. This was a plausible thing, and wrought much on all that heard it;
who plainly concluded, that those who denyed the people the use of the
Scriptures in their vulgar tongues, must needs know their own Doctrine and
practices to be inconsistent with it. Upon these grounds <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who
was projecting the most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means for promoting a Reformation of
Doctrine, moved in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, that they should Petition the King for leave
to make a Translation of the Bible. But <hi>Gardiner</hi> and all his party
opposed it, both in Convocation, and in secret with the King. It was said, that
all the Heresies and extravagant Opinions, which were then in <hi>Germany,</hi>
and from thence coming over to <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The
  Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to it.</note> sprang from the free use of the Scriptures. And
whereas in <hi>May</hi> the last year, Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>Hollanders</hi> were
accused of some Heretical Opinions; 
<q>denying Christ to be both God and man, or that he took Flesh and
  Blood of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or that the Sacraments had any effect on
  those that received them; </q>in which opinions Fourteen of them remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Obstinate, and were burnt by pairs in several places; it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that
all those drew their Damnable errors from the indiscreet use of the Scriptures.
And to offer the Bible in the <hi>English</hi> tongue to the whole Nation,
during these distractions, would prove, as they pretended, the greatest Snare
that could be. Therefore they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that there should be a short
exposition of the most useful and necessary Doctrines of the Christian Faith,
given to the people in the <hi>English</hi> tongue, for the Instruction of the
Nation, which would keep them in a certain Subjection to the King and the
Church, in Matters of Faith.</p>
            <p>The other party, though they liked well the publishing such a
Treatise in the vulgar tongue, yet by no means thought that suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; but
said, the people must be allowed to search the Scripture, by which they might
be convinced that such Treatises were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. These Arguments
prevailed with the Two Houses of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation. So they petitioned the King,
that he would give order to some, to set about it. To this, great Opposition
was made at Court. Some, on the one hand, told the King, that a diversity of
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions would arise out of it; and that he could no more Govern his Subjects,
if he gave way to that. But on the other hand, it was represented, that nothing
would make his Supremacy so acceptable to the Nation, and make the Pope more
hateful, than to let them see, that whereas the Popes had Governed them by a
blind obedience, and kept them in darkness, the King brought them into the
light, and gave them the free use of the word of God. And nothing would more
effectually extirpate the Popes Authority, and discover the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures of the
Monks, than the Bible in <hi>English</hi>; in which all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would clearly
discern, there was no Foundation for those things. These Arguments, joyned with
the Power that the Queen had in his affections, were so much considered by the
King, that he gave order for setting about it immediately. To whom that work
was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <pb n="196" facs="tcp:104314:120"/> or how they proceeded in it, I know not.
For the Account of these things has not been preserved, nor conveighed to us,
with that care that the Importance of the thing required. Yet it appears that
the work was carryed on at a good rate: for Three years after this, it was
Printed at <hi>Paris</hi>; which shows they made all convenient hast, in a
thing that required so much deliberation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The fall of Queen <hi>Anne.</hi>
               </note>But this
was the last publick good Act of this unfortunate Queen; who, the nearer she
drew to her end, grew more full of good works. She had distributed, in the last
Nine Moneths of her Life, between Fourteen and Fifteen Thousand Pounds to the
poor, and was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and publick good things. And by all appearance,
if she had lived, the Money that was raised by the Suppression of Religious
Houses, had been better employed than it was. In <hi>Ianuary,</hi> she brought
forth a dead Son. This was thought to have made ill Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions on the King:
and that, as he concluded from the death of his Sons by the former Queen, that
the Marriage was displeasing to God; so he might upon this misfortune, begin to
make the like Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Marriage. Sure enough the Popish party were
earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set against the Queen, looking on her as the great supporter of
Heresie. And at that time, <hi>Fox</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> was in
<hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> at <hi>Smalcald,</hi> treating a League with the Protestant
Princes, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted much on the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confession. There were many
Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between <hi>Fox</hi> and Doctor <hi>Barnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The whole Popish party drove it on.</note> and some others, with
the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines, for accommodating the differences between them,
and the thing was in a good forwardness. All which was imputed to the Queen.
<hi>Gardiner</hi> was then Ambassador in <hi>France,</hi> and wrote earnestly
to the King, to dissuade him from entring into any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous League with these
Princes: for that would alienate all the World from him, and dispose his own
Subjects to Rebel. The King thought the <hi>German</hi>-Princes and Divines
should have submitted all things to his Judgment, and had such an Opinion of
his own Learning, and was so puft up with the flattering praises that he daily
heard, that he grew impatient of any opposition, and thought that his Dictates
should pass for Oracles. And because the <hi>Germans</hi> would not receive
them so, his mind was alienated from them.</p>
            <p>But the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> at Court, and <hi>Gardiner</hi>
beyond Sea, thought there might easily be found a mean to accommodate the King,
both with the Emperor and the Pope, if the Queen were once out of the way; for
then he might freely Marry any one whom he pleased, and that Marriage, with the
Male Issue of it, could not be disputed: Whereas, as long as the Queen lived,
her Marriage, as being judged Null from the beginning, could never be allowed
by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any of that Party: with these reasons of
State, others of affection concurred. The Queen had been his Wife Three years;
but at this time he entertained a secret Love for <hi>Iane Seimour,</hi> who
had all the charmes both of Beauty and Youth in her person; and her humor was
tempered, between the severe gravity of Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> and the gay
pleasantness of Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> The Queen perceiving this Alienation of
the Kings heart, used all possible Arts to recover that affection, of whose
decay she was sadly sensible. But the Success was quite contrary to what she
designed. For the <pb n="197" facs="tcp:104314:120"/> King saw her no more with those
eyes,<note place="margin">1535.</note> which she had formerly cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated; but
grew jealous, and ascribed these caresses to some other criminal affections, of
which he began to suspect her. This being one of the most memorable passages of
this Reign, I was at more than ordinary pains to learn all I could concerning
it, and have not only seen a great many Letters that were writ, by those that
were set about the Queen, and catcht every thing that fell from her, and sent
it to Court, but have also seen an account of it, which the Learned
<hi>Spelman,</hi> who was a Judge at that time, writ with his own hand in his
Common-place Book, and another account of it writ by one <hi>Anthony
Anthony</hi> a Surveyor of the Ordnance of the <hi>Tower.</hi> From all which I
shall give a just and faithful relation of it, without conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the least
circumstance, that may either seem favourable or unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to her.</p>
            <p>She was of a very cheerful temper,<note place="margin">The Kings
  jealousie of her.</note> which was not always limited within the bounds of
exact decency and discretion. She had rallied some of the Kings Servants, more
than became her. Her Brother, the Lord <hi>Rochford,</hi> was her Friend as
well as Brother; but his spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wife was jealous of him: and being a Woman
of no sort of Vertue, (as will appear afterwards by her serving Queen
<hi>Katharine Howard</hi> in her beastly practices, for which she was attainted
and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted,) she carryed many Stories to the King, or some about him, to
perswade, that there was a familiarity between the Queen and her Brother,
beyond what so near a Relation could justifie. All that could be said for it,
was only this; that he was once seen leaning upon her Bed, which bred great
suspition. <hi>Henry Norris,</hi> that was Groom of the Stole, <hi>Weston,</hi>
and <hi>Brereton,</hi> that were of the Kings Privy-Chamber, and one <hi>Mark
Smeton,</hi> a Musician, were all observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have much of her favour. And
their zeal in serving her, was thought too warm and diligent to flow from a
less active Principle than Love. Many circumstances were brought to the King,
which working upon his aversion to the Queen, together with his affection to
Mistress <hi>Seimour,</hi> made him conclude her guilty. Yet somewhat which
himself observed, or fancied, at a Tilting at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to have given the Crisis to her Ruin. It is said, that he spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her let her
Handkerchief fall to one of her Gallants to wipe his face, being hot after a
Course. Whether she dropt it carelesly, or of design; or whether there be any
truth in that story, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning her fall, making no mention of it,
I cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; for <hi>Spelman</hi> makes no mention of it, and gives a
very different account of the discovery in these words. <hi>As for the evidence
of this matter, it was discovered by the Lady</hi> Wingfield, <hi>who had been
a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Queen, and becoming on a sudden infirm sometime before her
death, did swear this matter to one of her .....</hi> and here unluckily the
rest of the Page is torn off. By this it seems, there was no legal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
against the Queen, and that it was but a Witness at second hand, who deposed
what they heard the Lady <hi>Wingfield</hi> swear. Who this person was we know
not, nor in what temper of mind the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Wingfield</hi> might be, when she
swore it. The safest sort of forgery, to one whose Conscience can swallow it,
is to lay a thing on a dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons name, where there is no fear of discovery
before the great day: and <pb n="198" facs="tcp:104314:121"/> when it was understood that
the Queen had lost the Kings heart, many, either out of their zeal to Popery,
or design to make their fortune, might be easily induced to carry a story of
this Nature. And this it seems was that which was brought to the King at
<hi>Greenwich,</hi> who did thereupon immediately return to <hi>Whitehall,</hi>
it being the 1st of <hi>May.</hi> The Queen was immediately restrained to her
Chamber, the other Five were also seized on: But none of them would confess
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, but <hi>Mark Smeton, as to any actual thing,</hi> so
<hi>Cromwell</hi> writ. Upon this they were carryed to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Letters about this <hi>Cott.</hi> Lib. <hi>Otho</hi> C.
  10.</note> The poor Queen was in a sad condition; she must not only fall under
the Kings displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but be both defam'd and destroyed at once. At first she
smiled and carryed it cheerfully; and said, she believed the King did this
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove her. But when she saw it was in earnest; she desired to have the
Sacrament in her Closet, and expressed great devotion, and seemed to be
prepared for death.</p>
            <p>The surprize and confusion she was in, raised fits of the Mother,
which those about her did not seem to understand: But Three or Four Letters,
which were, writ concerning her to Court, say, that she was at some times very
devout, and cryed much; and of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den would burst out in Laughter, which are
evident signs of Vapours. When she heard that those who were accused with her,
were sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> she then concluded her self lost; and said,
she should be sent thither next; and talked idlely, saying, 
<q>That if her Bishops were about the King, they would all speak
  for her. She also said, That she would be a Saint in Heaven, for she had done
  many good deeds; and that there should be no Rain, but heavy judgments on the
  Land, for what they were now doing to her.</q> Her Enemies had now gone too
far, not to destroy her. Next day she was carryed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and
some Lords, that met her on the River, declared to her what her Offences were.
Upon which, she made deep Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations of her Innocence, and begged leave to
see the King; but that was not to be expected.<note place="margin">She is put in
  the <hi>Tower,</hi> and pleads her Innocency.</note> When she was carryed into
the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> 
               <q>She fell down on her knees, and prayed God to help her, as she
  was not guilty of the thing for which she was accused.</q> That same day the
King wrote to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> to come to <hi>Lambeth</hi>; but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him
not to come into his presence. Which was procured by the Queens Enemies, who
took care, that one who had such credit with the King, should not come at him,
till they had fully perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that she was guilty. Her Uncles Lady, the
Lady <hi>Boleyn,</hi> was appointed to lye in the Chamber with her. Which she
took ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill; for, upon what reason I know not, she had been in very ill
terms with her. She engaged her into much discourse, and studied to draw
Confessions from her. Whatsoever she said, was presently sent to the Court. And
a Woman full of Vapours, was like enough to tell every thing that was true,
with a great deal more; for persons in that condition, not only have no command
of themselves, but are apt to say any thing that comes in their fancy.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and some of the Kings Council, were
with her; but could draw nothing from her, though they made her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that
<hi>Norris</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> had accused her. But when they were gone, she
fell down on her knees and wept, and prayed often, <hi>Iesu 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104314:121"/> have Mercy on me</hi>; and then fell a-laughing: when
that fit was over, she desired to have the Sacrament still by her, that she
might cry for Mercy. And she said to the Lieutenant of the Tower, she was as
clear of the company of all men, as to sin, as she was clear from him; and that
she was the Kings true wedded Wife. And she cryed out, 
<q>O <hi>Norris,</hi> hast thou accused me? thou art in the
  <hi>Tower</hi> with me, and thou and I shall dye together; and <hi>Mark,</hi>
  so shall thou too.</q> She apprehended they were to put her in a Dungeon;<note place="margin">But confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet words.</note> and sadly bemoaned
her own, and her Mothers misery; and asked them, whether she must dye without
Justice. But they told her, the poorest Subjects had Justice, much more would
she have it. The same Letter sayes, that <hi>Norris</hi> had not accused her;
and that he said to her Almoner, that he could swear for her, <hi>she was a
good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> But she being made believe that he had accused her, and not
being then so free in her thoughts, as to consider that ordinary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice for
drawing out Confessions, told all she knew, both of him and <hi>Mark.</hi>
Which though it was not enough to destroy her, yet certainly wrought much on
the jealous and alienated King. 
<q>She told them, that she once asked <hi>Norris,</hi> why he did
  not go on with his Marriage? who answered her, that he would yet tarry some
  time. To which she replyed, you look for dead mens shoes; for if ought come to
  the King but good, you would look to have me. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, if he had any such
  thought, he would his head were cut off. Upon which, she said, she could undoe
  him if she pleased, and thereupon she fell out with him. As for <hi>Mark,</hi>
  who was then laid in Irons, she said, he was never in her Chamber, but when the
  King was last at <hi>Winchester</hi>; and then he came in to play on the
  Virginals: she said, that she never spoke to him after that, but on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday
  before <hi>May</hi> day, when she saw him standing in the Window, and then she
  asked him, why he was so sad; he said, it was no matter: she answered, you may
  not look to have me speak to you, as if you were a Nobleman, since you are an
  inferior person. No, no, Madam, said he, a Look sufficeth me. She seemed more
  ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of <hi>Weston,</hi> than of any body. For on
  <hi>Whitsun-Munday</hi> last he said to her, that <hi>Norris</hi> came more to
  her Chamber upon her account, than for any body else that was there. She had
  observed, that he loved a Kinswoman of hers, and challenged him for it, and for
  not loving his Wife. But he answered her, that there were Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the House,
  whom he loved better than them both; she ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who is that; your self said he;
  upon which, she said, she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him.</q> 
            </p>
            <p>This Misery of the Queens, drew after it the common effects that
follow persons under such a disgrace, for now all the Court was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her,
and every one was courting the rising Queen. But <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> had not
learned these Arts, and had a better Soul in him, than to be capable of such
baseness and ingratitude. He had been much obliged by her, and had conceived an
high opinion of her, and so could not easily receive ill impressions of her;
yet he knew the Kings temper, and that a down-right Justification of her would
provoke him: therefore he wrote the following Letter, on the 3d of
<hi>May,</hi> with all the softness that so tender a point required; in which
he justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <pb n="200" facs="tcp:104314:122"/> her,<note place="margin">1536.</note> as far
as was consistent with Prudence and Charity. The Letter showes of what a
Constitution he was that wrote it; and contains so many things that tend highly
to her honour, that I shall insert it here, as I copied it from the
Original.</p>

                     </note> written in your Graces name,
  I came to <hi>Lambeth</hi> yesterday, and do there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to know your Graces
  further pleasure. And forsomuch as without your Graces Commandment, I dare not,
  contrary to the Contents of the said Letters, presume to come unto your Graces
  Presence; nevertheless of my most bounden duty, I can do no less than most
  humbly to desire your Grace, by your great Wisdom, and by the Assistance of
  Gods help, somewhat to suppress the deep sorrows of your Graces heart, and to
  take all Adversities of Gods hands both patiently and thankfully. I cannot
  deny, but your Grace hath great causes many ways of lamentable heaviness: and
  also that in the wrongful estimation of the World, your Graces honour of every
  part is so highly touched (whether the things that commonly be spoken of, be
  true or not,) that I remember not that ever Almighty God sent unto your Grace,
  any like occasion to try your Graces constancy throughout, whether your
  Highness can be content to take off Gods hand, as well things displeasant, as
  plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant. And if he find in your most Noble heart such an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto his
  Will, that your Grace, without murmuration and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch heaviness, do accept
  all adversities, not less thanking him, than when all things succeed after your
  Graces Will and Pleasure, nor less procuring his Glory and Honour; then I
  suppose your Grace did never thing more acceptable unto him, since your first
  Governance of this your Realm. And moreover, your Grace shall give unto him
  occasion to multiply and encrease his Graces and benefits unto your Highness,
  as he did unto his most faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Iob</hi>; unto whom, after his
  great Calamities and heaviness, for his obedient heart, and willing acceptation
  of Gods scourge and rod, <hi>Addidit ei Dominus cuncta duplicia.</hi> And if it
  be true, that is openly reported of the Queens Grace, if men had a right
  estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things, they should not esteem any part of your Graces Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
  to be touched thereby, but her Honour only to be clearly disparaged. And I am
  in such a perplexity, that my mind is clean amazed. For I never had better
  opinion in Woman, than I had in her; which maketh me to think, that she should
  not be culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And again, I think your Highness would not have gon so far,
  except she had surely been culpable. Now I think that your Grace best knoweth,
  that next unto your Grace, I was most bound unto her of all creatures living.
  Wherefore I most humbly beseech your Grace, to suffer me in that, which both
  Gods Law, Nature, and also her kindness, bindeth me unto; that is, that I may
  with your Graces favour wish and pray for her, that she may declare her self
  inculpable and innocent. And if she be found culpable, considering your Graces
  goodness towards her, and from what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition your Grace of your only meer
  goodness took her, and set <pb n="201" facs="tcp:104314:122"/> the Crown upon her head; I
  repute him not your Graces faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant and Subject, nor true unto the
  Realm, that would not desire the offence without mercy to be punished, to the
  example of all other. And as I loved her not a little, for the Love which I
  judged her to bear towards God and his Gospel; so if she be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed culpable,
  there is not one that loveth God and his Gospel, that ever will favour her, but
  must hate her above all other; and the more they favour the Gospel, the more
  they will hate her: For then there was never creature in our time that so much
  slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Gospel. And God hath sent her this punishment, for that she
  feignedly hath professed his Gospel in her mouth, and not in heart and deed.
  And though she have offended so, that she hath deserved never to be reconciled
  unto your Graces favour; yet Almighty God hath manifoldly declared his goodness
  towards your Grace, and never offended you. But your Grace, I am sure,
  knowledgeth that you haue offended him. Wherefore I trust that your Grace will
  bear no less entire favour unto the truth of the Gospel, than you did before:
  Forsomuch as your Graces favour to the Gospel, was not led by affection unto
  her, but by zeal unto the truth. And thus I beseech Almighty God, whose Gospel
  he hath ordained your Grace to be Defender of, ever to preserve your Grace from
  all evil, and give you at the end, the promise of his Gospel.</p>

            <p>But Jealousie, and the Kings new affection, had quite defaced all
the remainders of esteem for his late beloved Queen. Yet the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
continued practising, to get further evidence for the Tryal; which was not
brought on, till the 12th of <hi>May</hi>; and then <hi>Norris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">She
  is brought to a Tryal.</note> 
               <hi>Weston, Brereton,</hi> and <hi>Smeton,</hi>
were tryed by a Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> in
<hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall. They were twice indicted, and the indictments were
found by two Grand Juries, in the Counties of <hi>Kent</hi> and
<hi>Middlesex</hi>: The Crimes with which they were charged, being 
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:104314:123"/> said to be done in both these Counties. <hi>Mark
Smeton</hi> confessed, he had known the Queen Carnally Three times: The other
Three plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>not Guilty,</hi> but the Jury upon the evidence formerly
mentioned, found them all <hi>Guilty</hi>; and Judgment was given, that they
should be drawn to the place of Execution, and some of them to be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
others to be beheaded, and all to be quartered, as Guilty of high Treason. On
the 15th of <hi>May,</hi> the Queen and her Brother the Lord <hi>Rochford</hi>
(who was a Peer, having been made a Viscount when his Father was Created Earl
of <hi>Wiltshire</hi>) were brought to be Tryed by their Peers: The Duke of
<hi>Norfolk</hi> being Lord high Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard for that occasion. With him sate the
Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Arundel,</hi> and Twenty Five more Peers, of whom their Father the Earl of
<hi>Wiltshire</hi> was one. Whether this unnatural complyance was imposed on
him by the Imperious King, or officiously submitted to by himself, that he
might thereby be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from the Ruin that fell on his Family, is not
known. Here the Queen of <hi>England</hi> by an unheard-of president was
brought to the Bar, and Indicted of high Treason. The Crimes charged on her
were, <hi>that she had procured her Brother and the other Four to lye with her,
which they had done often; that she had said to them, that the King never had
her heart, and had said to every one of them by themselves, that she loved them
better than any person whatsoever. Which was to the slander of the issue that
was begotten between the King and her.</hi> And this was Treason, according to
the Statute made in the 26th year of this Reign (so that the Law that was made
for her and the issue of her Marriage, is now made use of to destroy her). It
was also added in the Indictment, that she, and her complices, <hi>had
conspired the Kings death</hi>; but this it seems was only put in to swell the
charge, for if there had been any evidence for it, there was no need of
stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other Statute, or if they could have proved the violating of
the Queen, the known Statute of the Twenty Fifth year of the Reign of
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third had been sufficient. When the Indictment was read,
she held up her hand, and Pleaded <hi>not Guilty,</hi> and so did her Brother,
and did answer the evidence was brought against her discreetly. One thing is
remarkable that <hi>Mark Smeton,</hi> who was the only person that confessed
any thing, was never confronted with the Queen, nor was kept to be an evidence
against her, for he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Sentence Three dayes before, and so could
be no witness in Law: but perhaps, though he was wrought on to confess, yet
they did not think he had confidence enough to aver it to the Queens face;
therefore the evidence they brought, as <hi>Spelman</hi> says, was the Oath of
a Woman that was dead, yet this, or rather the Terror of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King,
so wrought on the Lords, that they found her and her Brother <hi>Guilty</hi>:
and Judgment was given, that she should be <hi>Burnt,</hi> or <hi>Beheaded at
the Kings pleasure.</hi> Upon which <hi>Spelman</hi> observes, that whereas
Burning is the death which the Law appoints for a Woman that is attainted of
Treason, yet since she had been Queen of <hi>England,</hi> they left it to the
King to determine, whether she should dye so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous a death, or be Beheaded;
but the Judges complained of this way of proceeding, and said, such a
disjunctive in a Judgment of Treason, had never been seen. The Lord
<hi>Rochford</hi> was also Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="203" facs="tcp:104314:123"/> to be Beheaded and
Quartered. Yet all this did not satisfie the enraged King, but the Marriage
between him and her must be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, and the issue illegitimated. The King
remembred an Intrigue that had been between her and the Earl of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> which was mentioned in the former Book; and that the
then Lord <hi>Piercy</hi> had said to the Cardinal, 'That he had gone so far
before witnesses, "that it lay upon his Conscience, so that he could not go
back: this it's like might be some promise he made to Marry her, <hi>per verba
de futuro,</hi> which though it was no Precontract in it self, yet it seems the
poor Queen was either so ignorant or so ill-advised, as to be perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
afterwards it was one, though it's certain that nothing, but a Contract <hi>per
verba de praesenti,</hi> could be of any force to annul the subsequent
Marriage. The King and his Council, reflecting upon what it seems the Cardinal
had told him, resolved to try what could be made of it, and pressed the Earl of
<hi>Northumberland</hi> to confess a Contract between him and her. But he took
his Oath before the Two Arch-Bishops, that there was no Contract, nor promise
of Marriage ever between them, and received the Sacrament upon it, before the
Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and others of the Kings Privy Council; wishing it
might be to his Damnation, if there was any such thing, (concerning which I
have seen the Original Declaration under his own hand.) Nor could they draw any
Confession from the Queen, before the Sentence, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if they could
have done that, the Divorce had gone before the Tryal; and then she must have
been tryed only, as <hi>Marchioness</hi> of <hi>Pembroke.</hi> But now she
lying under so terrible a Sentence, it is most probable, that either some hopes
of Life were given her;<note place="margin">Upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is
  di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced.</note> or at least, she was wrought on by the Assurances of
mitigating that cruel part of her judgment, of being <hi>Burnt,</hi> into the
milder part of the Sentence, of <hi>Having her head cut off</hi>; so that she
confessed a Pre-contract, and on the 17th of <hi>May</hi> was brought to
<hi>Lambeth</hi>; and in Court, the afflicted Arch-Bishop sitting Judge, some
persons of Quality being present, she confessed some just and lawful
impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments; by which it was evident, that her Marriage with the King was not
valid. Upon which Confession, the Marriage between the King and her was judged
to have been null and void. The Record of the Sentence is burnt; but these
particulars are repeated in the Act that passed in the next Parliament,
touching the Succession to the Crown. It seems this was secretly done, for
<hi>Spelman</hi> writes of it thus; It was said, there was a Divorce made
between the King and her, upon her confessing a Precontract with another before
her Marriage with the King: so then it was then only talkt of, but not
generally known.</p>
            <p>The two Sentences that were past upon the Queen, the one of
At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taindor for Adultery, the other of Divorce because of a Precontract, did so
contradict one another, that it was apparent, one, if not both of them must be
unjust; for if the Marriage between the King and her was null from the
beginning, then since she was not the Kings wedded Wife, there could be no
Adultery: and her Marriage to the King was either a true Marriage, or not; if
it was true, then the annulling of it was unjust, and if it was no true
Marriage, then the Attainder was unjust; for there could be no breach of that
Faith which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <pb facs="tcp:104314:124"/>

               </gap>eedings against her. Two days
after this, she was ordered to be Executed in the Green on <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi>
How she received these tidings, and how stedfast she continued in the
protestations of her Innocence, will best appear by the following
circumstances. The day before she suffered, upon a strict search of her past
Life, she called to mind, that she had played the Step-Mother too severely to
Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and had done her many injuries. Upon which, she made the
Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower's</hi> Lady sit down in the Chair of State;<note place="margin">Her Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for
  Death.</note> which the other, after some Ceremony, doing, she fell down on her
knees, and with many tears charged the Lady, as she would answer it to God, to
go in her name, and do, as she had done, to the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and ask her
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness for the wrongs she had done her. And she said, she had no quiet in
her Conscience till she had done that. But though she did in this what became a
Christian, the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> could not so easily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don these injuries;
but retained the resentments of them her whole life.</p>
            <p>This ingenuity and tenderness of Conscience about lesser matters,
is a great presumption, that if she had been guilty of more eminent faults, she
had not continued to the last denying them, and making protestations of her
Innocency. For that same night she sent her last message to the King, and
acknowledged her self much obliged to him, that had continued still to advance
her. She said, he had, from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gentlewoman, first made her a
Marchioness, and then a Queen; and now, since he could raise her no higher, was
sending her to be a Saint in Heaven: She protested her Innocence, and
recommended her Daughter to his care. And her carriage that day she died, will
appear from the following Letter writ by the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi>
copied from the Original, which I insert, because the Copier imployed by the
Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> has not writ it out faithfully; for I cannot think that
any part of it was left out on design.</p>

            <p>A little before Noon, being the 19th of <hi>May,</hi> she was
brought to the Scaffold,<note place="margin">Her Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> where she
made a short Speech to a great company that came to look on the last Scene of
this fatal Tragedy: The chief of whom, were the Dukes of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and
<hi>Richmond,</hi> the Lord Chancellor, and Secretary <hi>Cromwell,</hi> with
the Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen of <hi>London.</hi> 
               <q>She said, She was come to die, as she was Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law;
  she would accuse none, nor say any thing of the ground upon which she was
  judged. She prayed heartily for the King; and called him a most merciful and
  gentle Prince, and that he had been always to her, a good, gentle, Soveraign
  Lord: and if any would meddle with her cause, she required them to judge the
  best. And so she took her leave of them, and of the world; and heartily desired
  they would pray for her.</q> After she had been some time in her Devotions,
being her last words, <hi>To Christ I commend my Soul</hi>; her Head was cut
off by the Hangman of <hi>Calais,</hi> who was brought over as more expert at
Beheading than any in <hi>England</hi>: her Eyes and Lips were observed to move
after her Head was cut off, as <hi>Spelman</hi> writes; but her Body was thrown
into a common Chest of Elme-tree that was made to put Arrows in, and was buried
in the Chappel within the <hi>Tower</hi> before twelve a Clock.</p>
            <p>Her Brother with the other four did also suffer; none of them were
Quartered, but they were all Beheaded, except <hi>Smeton,</hi> who was Hanged.
It was generally said, that he was corrupted into that Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and had his
Life promised him; but it was not fit to let him live to tell Tales.
<hi>Norris</hi> had been much in the Kings favour, and an offer was made him of
his life, if he would confess his guilt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the Queen. But he
generously rejected that un-handsome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and said, 
<q>That in his Conscience he thought her Innocent of these things
  laid to her charge; but whether she was or not, he would not accuse her of any
  thing, and he would die a thousand times, rather than ruin an Innocent
  Person.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These proceedings occasioned as great variety of Censures,<note place="margin">The several Censures that were then passed on those
  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</note> as there were diversity of Interests. The Popish Party
said, the justice of God was visible, that she who had supplanted Queen
<hi>Katharine,</hi> met with the like, and harder measure, by the same means.
Some took notice of her faint justifying her self on the Scaffold, as if her
Conscience had then prevailed so far, that she could no longer deny a thing,
for which she was so soon to answer at another Tribunal. But others thought her
care of her Daughter made her speak so tenderly; for <pb n="206" facs="tcp:104314:126"/> she
had observed, that Queen <hi>Katharines</hi> obstinacy had drawn the Kings
indignation on her Daughter; and therefore that she alone might bear her
misfortunes, and derive no share of them on her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, she spake in a
stile, that could give the King no just offence: And as she said enough to
justifie her self, so she said as much for the Kings honour, as could be
expected. Yet in a Letter that she wrote to the King from the
<hi>Tower,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 4<hi>th.</hi>
               </note>
(which will be found in the Collection,) she pleaded her Innocence, in a strain
of so much Wit, and moving passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Eloquence, as perhaps can scarce be
paralelled: certainly her spirits were much exalted when she wrote it, for it
is a pitch above her ordinary stile. Yet the Copy I take it from, lying among
<hi>Cromwells</hi> other papers, makes me believe it was truely written by
her.</p>
            <p>Her carriage seemed too free, and all people thought that some
freedoms and levities in her had encouraged those unfortunate persons to speak
such bold things to her, since few attempt upon the Chastity, or make
declarations of Love, to persons of so exalted a quality, except they see some
invitations, at least in their carriage. Others thought that a free and jovial
temper might, with great Innocence, though with no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, lead one to all
those things that were proved against her; and therefore they concluded her
chast, though indiscreet. Others bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the King, and taxed his cruelty in
proceeding so severely against a person whose Chastity he had reason to be
assured of, since she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted his addresses near five years, till he
Legitimated them by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. But others excused him. It is certain her
carriage had given just cause of some jealousie, and that being the rage of a
man, it was no wonder if a King of his temper, conceiving it against one whom
he had so signally obliged, was transported into unjustifiable excesses.</p>
            <p>Others condemned <hi>Cranmer,</hi> as a man that obsequiously
followed all the Kings appetites; and that he had now Divorced the King a
second time, which shewed that his Conscience was governed by the Kings
pleasure as his Supreme Law. But what he did was unavoidable. For whatever
motives drew from her the Confession of that Precontract, he was obliged to
give Sentence upon it: And that which she confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, being such as made her
incapable to contract Marriage with the King, he could not decline the giving
of Sentence upon so formal a Confession. Some loaded all that favoured the
Reformation: and said, It now appeared what a woman, their great Patroness and
Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter had been. But to those it was answered, That her faults, if true,
being secret, could cast no reflection on those, who being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them,
made use of her Protection. And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thought not their
Cause suffered, by the enraged Cruelty and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the cursed
<hi>Irene,</hi> who had convened the second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and set
up the worship of Images again in the East; whom the Popes continued to court
and magnifie, after her barbarous murder of her Son, with other acts of
unsatiated spite and ambition. Therefore they had no reason to think the worse
of persons for claiming the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a Queen, whose faults (if she was at
all criminal,) were unknown to them when they made use of her.</p>
            <p>Some have since that time concluded it a great evidence of her
Guilt, that during her Daughters long and glorious Reign, there was no full nor
compleat vindication of her published. For the Writers of <pb n="207" facs="tcp:104314:126"/> that time thought it enough to speak honourably of her; and in
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to call her, <hi>Innocent.</hi> But none of them ever attempted a
clear discussion of the particulars laid to her charge. This had been much to
her Daughters honour, and therefore, since it was not done, others concluded it
could not be done; and that their knowledge of her guilt restrained their Pens.
But others do not at all allow of that Inference, and think rather, that it was
the great wisdom of that time not to suffer such things to be called in
question; since no wise Government will admit of a debate about the clearness
of the Princes Title. For the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attempting to prove it weakens it more,
than any of the proofs that are brought can confirm it; therefore it was
prudently done of that Queen and her great Ministers, never to suffer any
Vindication or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to be written. Some indiscretions could not be denied,
and these would all have been catched hold of, and improved by the busie
Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But nothing did more evidently discover the secret cause of this
Queens ruin, than the Kings Marrying <hi>Iane Seimour</hi>; the day after her
Execution. She of all King <hi>Henries</hi> Wives, gained most on his esteem
and affection: But she was happy in one thing, that she did not out-live his
love; otherwise she might have fallen as signally as her Predecessor had done.
Upon this turn of Affairs a great change of Counsels followed.</p>
            <p>There was nothing now,<note place="margin">The Lady <hi>Mary</hi>
  en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours a reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with her Father.</note> that kept the Emperor and
the King at a distance, but the Illegitimation of the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and
if that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been adjusted, the King was in no more hazard of trouble
from him: Therefore it was proposed, that she might be again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to the
Kings favour. She found this was the best opportunity she could ever look for,
and therefore laid hold on it, and wrote an humble submission to the King, and
desired again to be admitted to his presence. But her Submissions had some
reserves in them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she was pressed to be more express in her
acknowledgments. At this she stuck long, and had almost embroyled her self
again with her Father. She freely offered to submit to the Laws of the Land
about the Succession, and confessed the fault of her former Obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But the
King would have her acknowledge, that his Marriage to her Mother was incestuous
and unlawful; and to renounce the Popes Authority, and to accept him, as
Supream Head of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> These things were of hard
digestion with her, and she could not easily swallow them; so she wrote to
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> to befriend her at the Kings hands. Upon which many Letters
passed between them. He wrote to her, that it was impossible to recover her
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers favour, without a full and clear Submission in all points. So in the
end she yielded, and sent the following Paper, all written with her own hand,
which is set down, as it was Copied from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal yet extant.</p>

speech, told them, 
<q>That when the former Parliament was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, the King had no
  thoughts of Summoning a new one so soon. But for two reasons, he had now called
  them. The one was, that he finding himself subject to so many infirmities, and
  considering that he was Mortal, (a rare thought in a Prince) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired 
  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:104314:128"/> to settle an apparent heir to the Crown, in case he
  should die without Children lawfully begotten. The other was, to repeal an Act
  of the former Parliament, concerning the Succession of the Crown, to the issue
  of the King by Queen <hi>Anne Boleyn.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them to reflect on the
  great troubles and vexation the King was involved in, by his first unlawful
  Marriage, and the dangers he was in by his second; which might well have
  frighted any body from a third Marriage. But <hi>Anne,</hi> and her
  Conspirators, being put to death, as they well deserved; the King at the humble
  request of the Nobility, and not out of any Carnal concupiscence, was pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
  to Marry again, a Queen, by whom there were very probable hopes of his having
  children: Therefore he recommended to them, to provide an heir to the Crown by
  the Kings direction, who if the King dyed without children lawfully begotten,
  might Rule over them. He desired they would pray God earnestly, that he would
  grant the King issue of his own body; and return thanks to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that
  preserved such a King to them out of so many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers, who imployed all
  his care and endeavours, that he might keep his whole people in quiet, peace,
  and perfect charity, and leave them so to those that should succeed
  him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But though this was the chief cause of calling the Parliament, it
seems the Ministers met with great difficulties,<note place="margin">The Act of
  Succession.</note> and therefore spent much time, in preparing mens minds. For
the Bill about the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Crown, was not brought into the House of
Lords before the 30th day of <hi>Iune,</hi> that the Lord Chancellor offered it
to the House. It went through both Houses without any Opposition. 
<q>It contained first, a repeal of the former Act of Succession,
  and a Confirmation of the two Sentences of Divorce, the issue of both the Kings
  for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Marriages being declared illegitimate, and for ever excluded from
  claiming the inheritance of the Crown, as the Kings Lawful heirs by lineal
  descent. The Attainder of Queen <hi>Anne</hi> and her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices is confirmed.
  Quen <hi>Anne</hi> is said, to have been inflamed with pride, and Carnal
  desires of her body; and, having confederated her self with her complices, to
  have committed divers Treasons, to the danger of the Kings Royal person; (with
  other aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting words,) for which she had justly suffered death, and is now
  attainted by Act of Parliament. And all things that had been said or done
  against her, or her Daughter, being contrary to an Act of Parliament then in
  force, are pardoned; and the inheritance of the Crown is established, on the
  issue of Queen <hi>Iane,</hi> whether Male or Female, or the Kings issue by any
  other Wife whom he might Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry afterwards.</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q>But since it was not fit to declare, to whom the Succession of
  the Crown belonged after the Kings death lest the person, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, might
  be thereby enabled to raise trouble and Commotions; therefore they considering
  the Kings wise and excellent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and confiding in the love and
  affection which he bore to his Subjects, did give him full Power to declare the
  Succession to the Crown, either by his Letters Patents under the great Seal, or
  by his last will, Signed with his hand; and promised all faithful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to
  the persons named by him. And if any, so designed <pb n="211" facs="tcp:104314:128"/> to
  succeed in default of others, should endeavor to usurp upon those before them,
  or to exclude them, they are declared Traytors, and were to forfeit all the
  Right they might thereafter claim to the Crown. And if any should maintain the
  Lawfulness of the former Marriages, or that the issue by them was legitimate,
  or refused to swear to the Kings issue by Queen <hi>Iane,</hi> they were also
  declared Traytors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By this Act it may appear how absolutely this King Reigned in
<hi>England.</hi> Many question'd much the validity of it, and (as shall
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appear,) the <hi>Scots</hi> said, that the Succession to the Crown
was not within the Parliaments Power to determine aboutit, but must go by
inheritance to their King, in default of issue by this King. Yet by this, the
King was enabled to settle the Crown on his Children whom he had now declared
Illegitimate, by which he brought them more absolutely to depend upon himself.
He neither made them desperate, nor gave them any further Right, than what they
were to derive purely from his own good pleasure. This did also much pacifie
the Emperor, since his Kinswoman was, though not restored in blood, yet put in
a capacity to succeed to the Crown.</p>
            <p>At this time there came a new Proposition from <hi>Rome,</hi> to
try if the King would accommodate matters with the Pope.<note place="margin">The
  Pope endeavoured a reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the King.</note> Pope <hi>Clement</hi>
the Seventh dyed two years before this, in the year 1534. and Cardinal
<hi>Farnese</hi> succeeded him, called Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third. He had
before this made one unsuccessful attempt upon the King; but, upon the
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading of the Bishop (and declared Cardinal) of <hi>Rochester,</hi> he had
Thundered a most terrible Sentence of Deposition against the King, and designed
to commit the Execution of it to the Emperor: Yet now, when Queen
<hi>Katharine</hi> and Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> who were the occasions of the
Rupture, were both out of the way, he thought it was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per conjuncture to
try if a Reconciliation could be effected. This he proposed to Sir <hi>Gregory
Cassali,</hi> who was no more the Kings Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor at <hi>Rome,</hi> but was
still his Correspondent there. The Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired he would move the King in it,
and let him know that he had ever favoured his Cause in the former Popes time,
and though he was forced to give out a Sentence against him, yet he had never
any intention to proceed upon it to further Extremities.</p>
            <p>But the King was now so entirely alienated from the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">But in vain.</note> that to cut off all hopes
of reconciliation, he procured two Acts to be passed in this Parliament. The
one was for the utter extinguishing the Authority of the Bishop of
<hi>Rome.</hi> It was brought into the House of Lords on the 4th of
<hi>Iuly</hi>: And was read the first time the 5th, and the second time on the
6th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and lay at the Committee till the 12th. And on the 14th,
it was sent down to the Commons; who, if there be no mistake in the Journal,
sent it up that same day: They certainly made great haste, for the Parliament
was dissolved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Four days.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>The Preamble of this first Act contains severe Reflections on
  the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (whom some called the Pope,) who had long dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
  Gods word, that it might serve his Pomp, Glory, Avarice, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and
  Tyranny; both upon the Souls, Bodies, and Goods, of all Christians; excluding
  Christ out of the Rule of mans Soul, and Princes out of their Dominions: And
  had exacted in <hi>England</hi> 
                  <pb facs="tcp:104314:129"/> great Sums, by dreams, and
  vanities, and other Superstitious ways.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pon these reasons his Usurpations
  had been by Law put down in this Nation; yet many of his Emissaries were still
  practising up and down the Kingdom, and perswading people to acknowledg his
  pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Authority. Therefore every person so offending after the last of
  <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly</hi> next to come, was to
  incur the pains of a <hi>Premunire</hi>; and all Officers, both Civil, and
  Ecclesiastical, were commanded to make enquiry about such offences, under
  several penalties.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On the 12th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> a Bill was brought in, concerning
Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es obtained from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was read the First
time. And on the 17th it was agreed to, and sent down to the Commons, who sent
it up again the next day. 
<q>It bears, that the Popes had, during their Usurpation, granted
  many Immunities to several Bodies and Societies in <hi>England,</hi> which upon
  that Grant had been now long in use: Therefore all these Bulls, Breves, and
  every thing depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, or flowing from them, were declared void and of no
  force. Yet all Marriages celebrated by vertue of them, that were not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
  contrary to the Law of God, were declared good in Law; and all Consecrations of
  Bishops by vertue of them, were confirmed. And for the future, all who enjoyed
  any Priviledges by Bulls, were to bring them in to the Chancery, or to such
  persons as the King should appoint for that end. And the Arch-Bishop of
  <hi>Canterbury</hi> was Lawfully to grant anew the effects contained in them,
  which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rant was to pass under the
  great Seal, and to be of full force in Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This struck at the Abbots Rights. But they were glad to bear a
Diminution of their Greatness, so they might save the whole, which now lay at
stake. By the Thirteenth Act, they corrected an Abuse which had come in, to
evade the force of a Statute made in the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty First year of this King, about
the Residence of all Ecclesiastical persons in their Livings. One
qualification, that did excuse from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence, was their staying at the
University for the compleating of their Studies. Now it was found, that many
dissolute Clergymen went and lived at the Universities, not for their Studies,
but to be excused from serving their Cures. So it was Enacted, that none above
the Age of Forty, that were not either Heads of Houses, or Publick Readers,
should have any Exemption from their Residence, by vertue of that Clause in the
former Act. And those under that Age should not have the Benefit of it, except
they were present at the Lectures, and perform'd their Exercises in the
Schools.</p>
            <p>By another Act, there was Provision made against the prejudice the
Kings Heirs might receive, before they were of Age, by Parliaments held in
their Non-Age; That whatsoever Acts were made before they were Twenty Four
years of Age, they might at any time of their lives after that, Repeal and
Annul, by their Letters Patents, which should have equal force with a Repeal by
Act of Parliament. From these Acts it appears, that the King was absolute
Master, both of the affections and fears of his Subjects; when in a new
Parliament cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on a sudden, and in a Session of six weeks, from the 8th of
<hi>Iune,</hi> to the 18th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> Acts of this Importance were
passed without any Protest or publick Opposition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:104314:129"/>But having now opened the business of the
Parliament, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the State, I must next give an account of the
Convocation, which sate at this time, and was very busie,<note place="margin">The
  Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> as appears by the Journal of the House
of Lords, in which this is given for a reason of many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journments, because
the Spiritual Lords were busie in the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It sate down on the 9th of
<hi>Iune,</hi> according to <hi>Fullers</hi> Extract, it being the Custom of
all this Reign, for that Court to meet two or three days after the Parliament.
Hither <hi>Cromwell</hi> came as the Kings Vicar-General: But he was not yet
Vice-Gerent. For he sate next the Arch-Bishop; but when he had that Dignity he
sate above him. Nor do I find him Stiled in any Writing Vice-gerent for some
time after this; though the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> says, he was made Vice-gerent
the 18th of <hi>Iuly</hi> this year, the same day in which the Parliament was
Dissolved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Latimer,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> preached the
Latine Sermon, on these words. <hi>The Children of this World are wiser in
their Generation, than the Children of Light.</hi> He was the most Celebrated
Preacher of that time. The simplicity and plainness of his matter, with a
serious and fervent Action that accompanied it, being preferred to more learned
and elaborate Composures. On the 21st of <hi>Iune, Cromwell</hi> moved, that
they would Confirm the Sentence of the Invalidity of the Kings Marriage with
Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> which was accordingly done by both Houses of Convocation.
But certainly <hi>Fuller</hi> was asleep when he wrote; <hi>That Ten days
before that, the Arch-Bishop had passed the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Divorce, on the day
before the Queen was beheaded.</hi> Whereas if he had considered this more
fully, he must have seen that the Queen was put to death a Month before this,
and was Divorced two days before she dyed. Yet, with this animadversion, I must
give him my thanks for his pains in copying out of the Journals of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
many remarkable things, which had been otherwise irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably lost.</p>
            <p>On the 23d of <hi>Iune,</hi> the lower House of Convocation sent
to the upper House a Collection of many opinions, that were then in the Realm;
which, as they thought, were abuses, and errors, worthy of special Reformation.
But they began this Representation with a Protestation: 
<q>That they intended not to do, or speak any thing,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fuller.</hi>
                  </note> which might be unpleasant to the King;
  whom they acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Supream Head, and were resolved to obey his
  Commands, renouncing the Popes usurp'd Authority, with all his Laws and
  In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, now extinguisht and abolisht, and did addict themselves to
  Almighty God, and his Laws, and unto the King, and the Laws made within this
  Kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are Sixty Seven opinions set down, and are either the Tenets
of the Old <hi>Lollards,</hi> or the New Reformers, together with the
Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists opinions. Besides all which, they complained of many unsavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and
indiscreet expressions, which were either feigned on design to disgrace the New
Preachers, or were perhaps the extravagant Reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of some illiterate and
injudicious persons; who are apt upon all occasions, by their heat and folly,
rather to prejudice, than advance their party; and affect some petulant jeers,
which they think witty, and are perhaps well entertained by some others, who
though they <pb n="214" facs="tcp:104314:130"/> are more judicious themselves, yet imagining
that such jests on the contrary opinions will take with the people, do give
them too much Encouragement. Many of these jests, about Confession, praying to
Saints, Holy Water, and the other Ceremonies of the Church, were complained of.
And the last Articles contained sharp reflexions on some of the Bishops, as if
they had been wanting in their Duty to suppress such things. This was clearly
levelled at <hi>Cranmer, Latimer,</hi> and <hi>Shaxton,</hi> who were noted as
the great Promoters of these opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. The first did it prudently and solidly.
The second zealously and simply. And the third with much indiscreet pride and
vanity. But now that the Queen was gone, who had either raised or support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, their Enemies hoped to have advantages against them, and to lay the
growth of these opinions to their charge. But this whole Project failed, and
<hi>Cranmer</hi> had as much of the Kings favour as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for in stead of that
which they had projected, <hi>Cromwell,</hi> by the Kings order, coming to the
Convocation, Declared to them, that it was the Kings pleasure, that the Rites
and Ceremonies of the Church, should be Reformed by the Rules of Scripture, and
that nothing was to be maintained which did not rest on that Authority, for it
was absurd, since that was acknowledged to contain the Laws of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that
recourse should rather be had to Glosses, or the Decrees of Popes, than to
these. There was at that time one <hi>Alexander Alesse,</hi> a Scotch-man, much
esteemed for his Learning and Piety, whom <hi>Cranmer</hi> entertained at
<hi>Lambeth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Antiq. <hi>Britt. in vita
  Cranm.</hi>
               </note> Him <hi>Cromwell</hi> brought with him to the Convocation,
and desired him to deliver his opinion about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. He enlarged
himself much to Convince them, that only Baptism and the Lords Supper were
Instituted by Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stokesley</hi> Bishop of <hi>London</hi> answered him in a
long Discourse, in which he shewed he was better acquainted with the Learning
of the Schools, and the Canon-Law, than with the Gospel; He was Seconded by the
Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and others of that Party.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Cranmer</hi> in a long and learned Speech, shewed how
useless these niceties of the Schools were, and of how little Authority they
ought to be; and discoursed largely of the Authority of the Scriptures, of the
use of the Sacraments, of the uncertainty of Tradition, and of the Corruption
which the Monks and Friars had brought into the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine. He was
vigorously seconded by the Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> who told them, the
world would be no longer deceived with such So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticated stuff as the Clergy
had formerly vented: The Laity were now in all Nations studying the Scriptures,
and that, not only in the vulgar Translations, but in the original Tongues; and
therefore it was a vain imagination to think they would be any longer governed
by those arts which in the former Ages of Ignorance had been so effectual. Not
many days after this, there were several Articles brought in to the upper House
of Convocation, devised by the King himself, about which there were great
debates among them. The two Arch-Bishops, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Parties,
<hi>Cranmer</hi> was for a Reformation, and with him joyned <hi>Thomas
Goodrich,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely, Shaxton,</hi> of <hi>Sarum, Latimer,</hi> of
<hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, Fox,</hi> of <hi>Hereford, Hilsey,</hi> of <hi>Rochester,</hi>
and <hi>Barlow,</hi> of St. <hi>Davids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Lee,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> was a known
favourer of the Popes Interests; which, as it first appeared in his scrupling
so much, with <pb n="115" facs="tcp:104314:130"/> the whole Convocation of <hi>York,</hi>
the acknowledging the King to be <hi>Supreme Head of the Church of
England</hi>; so he had since discovered it on all occasions, in which he durst
do it without the fear of losing the Kings favour: So he, and
<hi>Stokesley,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London, Tonst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll,</hi> of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resm, Gardiner,</hi> of <hi>Winchester,
Longland,</hi> of <hi>Lincoln, Sherburn,</hi> of <hi>Chichester, Nix,</hi> of
<hi>Norwich,</hi> and <hi>Kite,</hi> of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> had been still
against all changes. But the King discovered, that those did in their hearts
love the Papal Authority, though <hi>Gardiner</hi> dissembled it most
artificially. <hi>Sherburn,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> upon what
inducement I cannot understand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed his Bishoprick, which was given to
<hi>Richard Sampson,</hi> Dean of the Chappel; a Pension of 400 <hi>l.</hi>
being reserved to <hi>Sherburn</hi> for his Life, which was confirmed by an Act
of this Parliament. <hi>Nix,</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> had also offended the
King signally, by some correspondence with <hi>Rome,</hi> and was kept long in
the <hi>Marshalsea,</hi> and was convicted and found in a <hi>Premunire</hi>:
The King considering his great Age, had upon his humble submission discharged
him out of Prison, and pardon'd him. But he died the former year; though
<hi>Fuller,</hi> in his slight way, makes him fit in this Convocation: For by
the 17th Act of the last Parliament,<note place="margin">Act 17.27.
  <hi>Regni.</hi>
               </note> it appears that the Bishoprick of <hi>Norwich</hi> being
vacant, the King had recommended <hi>William Abbot</hi> of St. <hi>Bennets</hi>
to it; but took into his own hands all the Lands and Manours of the Bishoprick,
and gave the Bishop several of the Priories in <hi>Norfolk</hi> in exchange,
which was confirmed in Parliament.</p>
            <p>I shall next give a short abstract of the Articles about Religion,
which were after much consultation and long debating agreed to.</p>
            <q> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>First,</hi>
                  <note place="margin"> 
                     <p>Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion.</p> 
                     <p>Printed by <hi>Fuller.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> All Bishops and
Preachers must instruct the people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the whole Bible, and the three
Creeds, that made by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and the
<hi>Athanasian</hi>; and interpret all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, and in the
very same words, and condemn all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies contrary to them, particularly those
condemned by the first four general Councils.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of <hi>Baptism</hi> the people must be
instructed; That it is a Sacrament instituted by Christ, for the Remission of
sins, without which none could attain Everlasting Life: And that, not only
those of full Age, but Infants, may, and must be Baptized, for the pardon of
Original sin, and obtaining the gift of the Holy Ghost, by which they became
the Sons of God. That none Baptized, ought to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized again. That the
opinions of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Pelagians,</hi> were detestable
Heresies: And that those of ripe Age, who desired Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, must with it joyn
Repentance and Contrition for their sins, with a firm Belief of the Articles of
the Faith.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Concerning <hi>Penance,</hi> they were to
instruct the people, that it was instituted by Christ, and was absolutely
necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That it consisted of Contrition, Confession and
Amendment of Life; with exterior works of Charity, which were the worthy
<hi>Fruits of Pennance.</hi> For Contrition, it was an inward shame and sorrow
for sin, because it is an offence of God, which provokes his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. To
this must be joyned, a Faith of the mercy and goodness of God, whereby the
penitent must hope, that God will forgive him, and repute him justified, and of
the number of his Elect Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not for the worthiness of any merit or work
done by him, but <pb n="116" facs="tcp:104314:131"/> for the only Merits of the Blood and
Passion of our Saviour Jesus Christ. That this Faith is got and confirmed, by
the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Promises of the Gospel, and the use of the
Sacraments: And for that end, Confession to a Priest is necessary, if it may be
had, whose Absolution was instituted by Christ, to apply the promises of Gods
Grace to the penitent: Therefore the people were to be taught, That the
Absolution is spoken by an Authority given by Christ in the Gospel to the
Priest, and must be believed, as if it were spoken by God himself, according to
our Saviours words; and therefore none were to condemn auricular Confession,
but use it for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their Consciences. The people were also to be
instructed, that though God pardoned sin, only for the satisfaction of Christ;
yet they must bring forth the Fruits of Penance, Prayer, Fasting, Almsdeeds,
with restitution and satisfaction for wrongs done to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with other works
of Mercy and Charity, and Obedience to Gods Commandments, else they could not
be saved; and that by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these, they should both obtain Everlasting Life,
and mitigation of their Afflictions in this present life, according to the
Scriptures.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As touching the Sacrament of the Altar, people
were to be instructed, that under the Forms of Bread and Wine, there was truly
and substantially given, the very same Body of Christ, that was born of the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; and therefore it was to be received with all Reverence,
every one duly Examining himself, according to the words of St.
<hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The people were to be instructed, That
Justification signifieth Remission of sins, and acceptation into the favour of
God; that is to say, a perfect Renovation in Christ. To the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining which,
they were to have, Contrition, Faith, Charity, which were both to concur in it,
and follow it; and that the good works necessary to Salvation, were not only
outward Civil works, but the inward motions and graces of Gods Holy Spirit, to
dread, fear, and love him, to have firm confidence in God, to call upon him,
and to have patience in all adversities, to hate sin, and have purposes and
wills not to sin again; with such other motions and vertues, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting and
agreeable to the Law of God.</p> 
               <p> The other Articles were about the Ceremonies of the Church.
<hi>First,</hi> of Images. The people were to be instructed, That the use of
them was warranted by the Scriptures, and that they served to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to
them good Examples, and to stir up Devotion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was meet that
they should stand in the Churches. But that the people might not fall into such
Superstition as it was thought they had done in time past, they were to be
taught, to reform such Abuses, lest Idolatry might ensue, and that in censing,
kneeling, offering, or worshipping them, the people were to be instructed, not
to do it to the Image, but to God and his honour.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the honouring of Saints, they were not to
think to attain these things at their hands, which were only obtained of God,
but that they were to honour them, as persons now in glory, to praise God for
them, and imitate their vertues, and not fear to die for the Truth, as many of
them had done.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For praying to Saints, The people were to be
taught, <pb n="217" facs="tcp:104314:131"/> that it was good to pray to them, to pray for,
and with us. And to correct all Superstitious Abuses in this matter, they were
to keep the days appointed by the Church for their Memories, unless the King
should lessen the number of them, which if he did, it was to be obeyed.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Of Ceremonies. The people were to be taught,
That they were not to be condemned and cast away, but to be kept as good and
laudable, having mystical significations in them, and being useful to lift up
our minds to God. Such were the Vestments in the worship of God: The sprinkling
holy-water to put us in mind of our Baptism and the Blood of Christ: Giving
holy Bread, in sign of our Union in Christ, and to remember us of the
Sacrament: Bearing Candles on <hi>Candlemas</hi>-day, in remembrance, that
Christ was the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Light: Giving Ashes on <hi>Ash-wednes</hi>-day, to
put us in mind of Penance, and of our Mortality: Bearing Palms on
<hi>Palm-sunday,</hi> to show our desire to receive Christ in our hearts, as he
entred into <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>: Creeping to the Cross on <hi>Good-friday,</hi>
and kissing it, in memory of his death, with the setting up the Sepulchre on
that day: The Hallowing the Font, and other Exorcisms and Benedictions.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>And lastly,</hi> As to Purgatory, They were to declare it
good and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to pray for the Souls departed, which was said to have
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church from the beginning: And therefore the people were to
be instructed, That it consisted well with the due order of Charity, to pray
for them, and to make others pray for them, in Masses and Exequies, and to give
Alms to them for that end. But since the place they were in, and the pains they
suffered, were uncertain by the Scripture, we ought to remit them wholly to
Gods mercy: Therefore all these Abuses were to be put away, which, under the
pretence of Purgatory, had been advanced, as if the Popes pardons did deliver
Souls out of it, or Masses said in certain places, or before certain Images,
had such efficiency: with other such-like Abuses.</p>
            </q>
            <p>These Articles being thus conceived, and in several places
corrected, and tempered by the Kings own hand, were signed by
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and seventeen
other Bishops, forty Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots and Priors, and fifty Arch-Deacons and Proctors of
the lower House of Convocation. Among whom, <hi>Polidor Virgil</hi> and
<hi>Peter Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> signed with the rest, as appears by the Original yet
extant.<note place="margin">Published by the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> They being
tendered to the King, he confirmed them, and ordered them to be published with
a Preface in his name. 
<q>It is said in the Preface, that he, accounting it the chief part
  of his Charge, that the Word and Commandments of God should be believed and
  observed, and to maintain unity and concord in opinion; and understanding, to
  his great regret, that there was great diversity of opinion arisen among his
  Subjects, both about Articles of Faith and Ceremonies, had in his own Person
  taken great pains and study about these things, and had ordered also the
  Bishops, and other Learned men of the Clergy, to examine them; who after long
  deliberation had concluded on the most special Points, which, the King thought,
  proceeded from a good, right, and true judgment, according to the Laws of God;
  these would also be profitable, for establishing unity in the Church of
  <hi>England</hi>: Therefore he had ordered them to be published, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring 
  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:104314:132"/> all to accept of them, praying God so to illuminate
  their hearts, that they might have no less zeal and love to unity and concord
  in reading them, than he had in making them to be devised, set forth, and
  published; which good acceptance should encourage him to take further pains for
  the future, as should be most for the honour of God, and the profit, and the
  quietness of his Subjects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This being published, occasion'd great variety of Censures. Those
that desired Reformation,<note place="margin">And variously censured.</note> were
glad to see so great a step once made; and did not doubt, but this would make
way for further Changes. They rejoyced to see the Scriptures, and the ancient
Creeds, made the Standards of the Faith, without mentioning Tradition, or the
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Church. Then the Foundation of Christian Faith was truly
stated, and the terms of the Covenant between God and man in Christ were
rightly opened, without the niceties of the Schools of either side. Immediate
worship of Images and Saints was also remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Purgatory was declared
uncertain by the Scripture. These were great advantages to them, but the
establishing the necessity of Auricular Confession, the Corporal presence in
the Sacrament, the keeping up and doing reverence to Images, and the praying to
Saints, did allay their joy, yet they still counted it a victory, to have
things brought under debate, and to have some Grosser abuses taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>The other Party were unspeakably troubled. Four Sacraments were
passed over, which would encourage ill-affected people to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them. The
gainful trade by the Belief of Purgatory was put down; for though it was said
to be good to give Alms for praying for the dead, yet since both the dreadful
Stories of the Miseries of Purgatory, and the Certainty of Redeeming Souls out
of them by Masses, were made doubtful, the peoples Charity and bounty that way
would soon abate. And in a word, the bringing matters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dispute, was a
great Mortification to them, for all concluded, that this was but a Preamble to
what they might expect after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>When these things were seen beyond Sea, the Papal party made
every-where great use of it, to show the Necessity of adhering to the Pope;
since the King of <hi>England,</hi> though, when he broke off from his
Obedience to the Apostolick See, he pretended, he would maintain the Catholick
Faith entire, yet was now making great Changes in it. But others, that were
more moderate, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that there was great temper and prudence in
contriving these Articles. And it seems, the Emperor, and the more Learned
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines about him, both approved of the Precedent, and liked the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
so well, that not many years after, the Emperor published a work not unlike
this, called, <hi>The Interim</hi>; because it was to be in force in that
<hi>Interim,</hi> till all things were more fully debated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by a
General Council, which, in many particulars, agreed with these Articles. Yet
some stricter persons censured this work much, as being a Political dawbing, in
which, they said, there was more pains taken to gratifie persons, and serve
particular ends, than to assert Truth in a free and un-biassed way, such as
became Divines. This was again excused, and it was said, that all things, could
not <pb n="219" facs="tcp:104314:132"/> be attained on a sudden: that some of the Bishops
and Divines, who afterwards arrived at a clearer understanding of some matters,
were not then so fully convinced about them, and so it was their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and not their Cowardice or Policy, that made them compliant in some things.
Besides, it was said, that as our Savior did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal all things to his
Disciples, till they were able to bear them; and as the Apostles did not of a
sudden abolish all the Rites of Judaisme, but for some time, to gain the Jews,
complyed with them, and went to the Temple, and offered Sacrifices: so the
people were not to be over driven in this Change. The Clergy must be brought
out of their ignorance by degrees, and then the people were to be better
instructed; but to drive furiously, and do all at once, might have spoiled the
whole design, and totally alienated those who were to be drawn on by degrees;
it might have also much endangered the peace of the Nation, the people being
much disposed by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the Friers to rise in Arms: Therefore these
slow steps were thought the surer and better method.</p>
            <p>On the last day of the Convocation, there was another Writing
brought in by <hi>Fox</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The
  Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares against the Council called by the Pope.</note>
occasioned by the Summons for a General Council to sit at <hi>Mantua,</hi> to
which the Pope had cited the King to appear. The King had made his appeal from
the Pope to a General Council, but there was no reason to expect any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in an assembly so constituted, as this was like to be. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was
thought fit to publish somewhat of the Reasons why the King could not submit
his matter to the Decision of such a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as was then intended. And it was
moved, that the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should give their sense of it.</p>
            <p>The Substance of their Answer, (which the Reader will find in the
Collection,) was,<note place="margin">Collect <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <q>That as nothing was better Instituted by the Ancient Fathers,
  for the Establishment of the Faith, the Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heresies, the Healing
  of Schisms, and the Unity of the Christian Church, than General Councils,
  gathered in the Holy Ghost, duely called to an indifferent place; with other
  necessary requisites: So on the other hand nothing could produce more
  pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiferous effects, than a General Council called upon private malice, or
  Ambition, or other carnal respects; which <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> so well
  observed in his time, that he thought <hi>all Assemblies of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were to be
  eschewed, for he never saw good come of any of them, and they had encreased,
  rather than healed the distempers of the Church. For the appetite of
  vain-glory, and a contentious humor bore down rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> Therefore they
  thought Christian Princes ought to employ all their endeavors to prevent so
  great a mischief. And it was to be considered, First, who had Authority to call
  one. Secondly, If the Reasons for calling one were weighty. Thirdly, who should
  be the Judges. Fourthly, what should be the manner of Proceeding. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
  what things should be treated of in it. And as to the first of these, they
  thought neither the Pope, nor any one Prince of what dignity soever, had
  Authority to call one, without the Consent of all other Christian Princes:
  especially such as had entire and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Government over all their
  Subjects.</q> This was Signed on the 20th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> by
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> 
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:104314:133"/> with 14 Bishops, and 40 Abbots, Priors, and Clerks, of
the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Whether this and the former Articles
were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Signed by the Convocation of the Province of <hi>York,</hi> does not
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by any Record, but that I think is not to be doubted. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obtained, the King published a long and sharp Protestation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Council
now Summoned to <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King publishes his
  reasons against it.</note> In which he shewes, that the Pope had no Power to
call one; 
<q>for as it was done by the Emperors of old; so it pertained to
  Christian Princes now. That the Pope had no Jurisdiction in <hi>England,</hi>
  and so could Summon none of this Nation to come to any such meeting. That the
  place was neither safe nor proper: That nothing could be done in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to
  any purpose,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fox.</hi>
                  </note> if the Pope sate Judge in
  chief in it, since one of the true ends, why a Council was to be desired, was
  to reduce his Power within its old limits. A free General Council was that
  which he much desired; but he was sure this could not be such: And the present
  distractions of Christendom, and the Wars between the Emperor and the
  <hi>French</hi> King, shewed this was no proper time for one. The Pope who had
  long refused or delayed to call one, did now choose this Conjuncture of
  affairs, knowing that few would come to it, and so they might carry things as
  they pleased. But the World was now awake; the Scriptures were again in mens
  hands, and people would not be so tamely couzen'd as they had been. Then he
  shewes how unsafe it was, for any <hi>English</hi> man to go to
  <hi>Mantua,</hi> how little regard was to be had to the Popes safe Conduct,
  they having so oft broken their Oaths and Promises. He also shew's how little
  reason he had to trust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Pope, how kind he had been to that See
  formerly, and how basely they had requited it: And that now these Three years
  past, they had been stirring up all Christian Princes against him, and using
  all possible means to create him trouble. Therefore he declared, he would not
  go to any Council called by the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; but when there was a
  General peace among Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he would most gladly hearken to the
  motion of a true Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council: and in the mean-while, he would preserve all
  the Articles of the Faith in his Kingdom, and sooner lose his Life and his
  Crown, than suffer any of them to be put down. And so he protested against any
  Council to be held at <hi>Mantua,</hi> or any where else, by the Bishop of
  <hi>Romes</hi> Authority: That he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it, nor receive any of
  their Decrees.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Reginald Pool,</hi> who was of the Royal Blood,
being by his Mother descended from the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Brother to
King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth,<note place="margin">Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi>
  opposes the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</note> and in the same degree of kindred with
the King by his Fathers side, was in great esteem for his Learning, and other
Excellent vertues. It seems the King had determined to breed him up to the
greatest dignity in the Church; and to make him as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent in Learning, and
other acquired parts, as he was for Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a Natural Sweetness and
Nobleness of temper. Therefore the King had given him the Deanery of
<hi>Excester,</hi> with several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dignities, towards his maintenance
beyond Sea; and sent him to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he stayed several years:
There he first incurred the Kings displeasure. For, being desired by him to
concur with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, <pb n="221" facs="tcp:104314:133"/> in procuring the Subscriptions
and Seals of the <hi>French</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, he excused himself; yet it was
in such terms, that he did not openly declare himself against the King: After
that, he came over to <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>as he writes himself,</hi> was
present when the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy made their Submission, and acknowledged the King
<hi>Supream Head</hi>: In which, since he was then Dean of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and
kept his Dean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry several years after that, it is not to be doubted, but that,
as he was by his place obliged to sit in the Convocation, so he concurred with
the rest in making that Submission. From thence he went to <hi>Padua,</hi>
where he lived long, and was received into the Friendship and Society of some
celebrated persons, who gave themselves much to the Study of Eloquence and of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors. These were <hi>Centareno, Bembo, Caraffa,
Sadoletti,</hi> with a great many more, that became afterwards well known over
the World: But all those gave <hi>Pool</hi> the Preheminence, and that justly
too, for he was accounted one of the most Eloquent men of his time.</p>
            <p>The King called him oft home to assist him in his affairs, but he
still declined it; at length finding delays could prevail no longer, he wrote
the King word, that he did not approve of what he had done, neither in the
matter of his Divorce, nor his separation from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick See. To this the
King answered, desiring his reasons why he disagreed from him, and sent him
over a Book which Doctor <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> had writ in defence of the
Proceedings in <hi>England.</hi> Upon which he wrote his Book <hi>De unione
Ecclesiastica,</hi> and sent it over to the King; and soon after Printed it
this year.<note place="margin">And writes his Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> In which
Book he condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Kings Actions, and pressed him to return to the
obedience he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> with many sharp reflections; but
the Book was more considered for the Author, and the Wit and Eloquence of it,
than for any great Learning, or deep reasoning in it. He did also very much
depress the Royal, and exalt the Papal Authority: He compared the King to
<hi>Nebuchadonosor,</hi> and addressed himself in the Conclusion to the
Emperor, whom he conjured to turn his Arms ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the King than the
Turk. And indeed the indecencies of his expressions against the King, not to
mention the scurrilous Language he bestows on <hi>Sampson,</hi> whose Book he
undertakes to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, are such, that it appears how much the <hi>Italian</hi>
Air had chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and that his Converse at <hi>Padua</hi> had for some time
defac'd that generous temper of mind, which was otherwise so natural to
him.</p>
            <p>Upon this, the King desired him at first to come over, and explain
some passages in his Book: But when he could not thus draw him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his
toyles, he proceeded severely against him, and devested him of all his
Dignities; but these were plentifully made up to him by the Popes bounty, and
the Emperors. He was afterwards rewarded with a Cardinals hat, but he did not
rise above the degree of a Deacon. Some believe that the Spring of this
opposition he made to the King was a secret affection he had for the Lady
<hi>Mary.</hi> The publishing of this Book, made the King set the Bishops on
work to write Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his Actions: which <hi>Stokesley</hi> and
<hi>Tonstal</hi> did in a long and Learned Letter, that they wrote to
<hi>Pool.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Many Books are written for the King.</note>
And <hi>Gardiner</hi> publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Book of <hi>true obedience</hi>: To which
<hi>Bonner,</hi> who was hot on <pb facs="tcp:104314:134"/> the scent of Preferment, added a
Preface. But the King designed sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tools for <hi>Pool's</hi> punishment:
Yet an Attaindor in absence was all he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld do against himself. But his Family and kindred felt the weight
of the Kings displeasure very sensibly.</p>
            <p>But now I must give an account of the dissolution of the
Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries pursuant to the Act of Parliament, though I cannot fix the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
time in which it was done. I have seen the Original Instructions with the
Commission, given to those who were to visit the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries in and about
<hi>Bristol.</hi> All the rest were of the same kind: They bear date the 28th
of <hi>April,</hi> after the Session of Parliament was over; and the report was
to be made in the Octaves of St. <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> the Arch-Angel. But I am
inclined to think that the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion and disorder things were in by the
Queens death, made the Commissioners unwilling to proceed in so invidious a
matter, till they saw the Issue of the new-Parliament. Therefore I have
delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed giving any account of the Proceedings in that matter till this place.
The Instructions will be found in the Collection. The Substance of them was as
follows.</p>

Monasteries.</p>
                  </note>The Auditors of the Court of Augmentations, were the
  persons that were employed. Four, or any Three of them, were Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned to
  execute the Instructions in every particular Visitation. One Auditor, or
  Receiver, and one of the Clerks of the former Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were to call for
  Three discreet persons in the County, who were also named by the King. They
  were to signifie to every House the Statute of Dissolution, and shew them their
  Commission. Thenthey were to put the Governor, or any other officer of the
  House, to declare upon Oath the true State of it: And to require him speedily
  to appear before the Court of Augmentations, and in the mean time not to meddle
  with any thing belonging to the House. Then to examine how many Religious
  persons were in the House, and what lives they led; how many of them were
  Priests, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them would go to other Religious Houses, and how many of
  them would take Capacities and go into the World. They were to estimate the
  State and Fabrick of the House, and the number of the Servants they kept: and
  to call for the Covent-Seal, and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and put them in some sure place,
  and take an Inventory of all their Plate, and their Movable goods, and to know
  the value of all, that before the 1st of <hi>March</hi> last belonged to the
  House, and what debts they owed. They were to put the Covent-Seal, with the
  Jewels and Plate in safe keeping, and to leave the rest (an Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory being
  first taken) in the Governors hands, to be kept by them till further Order. And
  the Governors were to meddle with none of the Rents of the House, except for
  necessary Sustenance, till they were another way disposed of. They were to try
  what Leas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Deeds had been made for a whole year before the 4th of
  <hi>February</hi> last. Such as would still live in Monasteries, were to be
  recommended to some of the great Monasteries that lay next: and such as would
  live in the world, must come to the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or the
  Lord Chancellor, to receive Capacities. (From which it appears that
  <hi>Cromwell</hi> was not at this time Lord Vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, for he granted these
  Capacities when he was in that Power.) <pb n="223" facs="tcp:104314:134"/> And the
  Commissioners were to give them a reasonable allowance for their Journey,
  according to the distance they lived at. The Governor was to be sent to the
  Court of Augmentations, who were to assign him a yearly pension for his
  Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What Report those Commissioners made, or how they obeyed their
Instructions, we know not; for the Account of it is razed out of the Records.
The Writers that lived near that time represent the matter very odiously, and
say; about ten Thousand persons were set to seek for their Livings; only Forty
Shillings in Money, and a Gown, being given to every Religious man. The Rents
of them all, rose to about Thirty Two Thousand Pound: And the Goods, Plate,
Jewels, and other movables, were valued at an Hundred Thousand Pound: And it is
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally said, and not improbably, that the Commissioners were as careful to
enrich themselves, as to encrease the Kings Revenue. The Churches and Cloysters
were for the most part pulled down; and the Lead, Bells, and other Materials
were sold; and this must needs have raised great discontents every-where.</p>
            <p>The Religious persons that were undone, went about complaining of
the Sacriledge and Injustice of this Suppression; That what the piety of their
Ancestors had dedicated to God and his Saints,<note place="margin">Great
  discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents among all sorts of people.</note> was now invaded and converted to
secular ends. They said, the Kings severity fell first upon some particular
persons of their Orders, who were found delinquents; but now, upon the
pretended miscarriages of some Individual persons, to proceed against their
Houses, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them, was an unheard-of practice. The Nobility, and
Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whose Ancestors had founded or enriched these Houses, and who provided
for their younger Children, or empoverished Friends, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into
these Sanctuaries, complained much of the prejudice they sustained by it. The
people, that had been well entertained at the Abbots Tables, were sensible of
their loss: for generally, as they Travelled over the Countrey, the Abbies were
their Stages, and were Houses of Reception to Travellers and Strangers. The
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouter sort of people of their perswasion, thought their friends must now
lie in Purgatory without relief, except they were at the charge to keep a
Priest, who should daily say Mass for their Souls. The poor, that fed on their
daily Alms, were deprived of that supply.</p>
            <p>But to compose these discontents,<note place="margin">Endeavors are
  used to quiet these.</note> first many Books were publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to shew what
Crimes, Cheats, and Impostures, those Religious persons were guilty of. Yet
that wrought not much on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for they said, why were not these Abuses
severely punished and reformed? But must whole Houses, and the Succeeding
Generations, be punished for the faults of a few? Most of these reports were
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so denyed, and even those who before envyed the ease and plenty in which the
Abbots and Monks lived, began now to pity them, and condemned the proceedings
against them. But to allay this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral discontent; <hi>Cromwell</hi> advised
the King to sell their Lands at very easie rates to the Gentry in the several
Counties, obliging them, since they had them upon such terms, to keep up the
wonted Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality. This drew in the Gentry a-pace both to be satisfied with
what was done; and to Assist the Crown for ever in the defence of these Laws:
their own interest being so enterwoven with the Rights <pb n="224" facs="tcp:104314:135"/>
of the Crown. The commoner sort, who, like those of old that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Christ
for the Loaves, were most concerned for the loss of a good dinner on a
Holy-day, or when they went over the Countrey about their business, were now
also in a great measure satisfied, when they heard that all to whom these Lands
were given, were obliged under heavy Forfeitures to keep up the Hospitality;
and when they saw that put in practice, their discontent, which lay chiefly in
their Stomach, was appeased.</p>
            <p>And to quiet other people, who could not be satisfied with such
things, the King made use of a Clause in the Act that gave him the lesser
Monasteries, which Empowered him to continue such as he should think fit.
Therefore on the 17th of <hi>August,</hi> he by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, did of
new give back <hi>in perpetuam Eleemosynam</hi> for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Alms,<note place="margin">Collect
  <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. sect. 2.</note> Five Abbies. The first of these, was the
Abbey of St. <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Betlesden</hi> of the <hi>Cistercian</hi>
order in <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> ten more were afterwards confirmed. Sixteen
Nunneries, were also confirmed; In all Thirty one Houses. The Patents (in most
of which some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors are excepted, that had been otherwise disposed of,) are
all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, and yet none of our Writers have taken any notice of this. It
seems these Houses had been more regular than the rest: So that in a General
Calamity they were rather reprieved than excepted: for two years after this, in
the Suppression of the rest of the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they fell under the common
fate of other Houses. By these new Endowments, they were obliged to pay Tenthes
and first-Fruits, and to obey all the Statutes and Rules that should be sent to
them from the King, as Supream Head of the Church. But it is not unlike, that
some presents, to the Commissioners, or to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> made these Houses
outlive this ruin: for I find great trading in Bribes at this time, which is
not to be wondred at, when there was so much to be shared.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Yet people generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to
  Rebel.</note>But great disorders followed upon the Dissolution of the other
Houses. People were still generally discontented. The Suppression of Religious
Houses occasioned much out-crying, and the Articles then lately published about
Religion, encreased the distaste they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the Government. The old
Clergy were also very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to improve all opportunities, and to blow upon
every spark. And the Popes Power of deposing Kings had been for almost five
hundred years received as an Article of Faith. The same Council that
esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Transubstantiation, had asserted it: and there were many
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, not only in <hi>Germany, France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
but also in <hi>England,</hi> of Kings that were Deposed by Popes, whose
Dominions were given to other Princes. This had begun in the Eighth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in two famous Deprivations. The one in <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Childeric</hi>
the 3d, who was deprived, and the Crown given to <hi>Pepin</hi>: and about the
same time, those Dominions in <hi>Italy</hi> which were under the Eastern
Emperors, renounced their alleagance to them. In both these the Popes had a
great hand, yet they rather confirmed and approved of those Treasonable
Mutations, than gave the first rise to them. But after Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>
the 7th's time, it was clearly assumed, as a Right and Prerogative of the Papal
Crown, to Depose Princes, and absolve Subjects from the Oaths of Alleagance,
and set up others in their <pb n="225" facs="tcp:104314:135"/> stead. And all those Emperors
or Kings, that contested any thing with Popes, sat very uneasie and unsafe in
their Thrones, ever after that. But if they were tractable to the demands of
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> then they might oppress their Subjects, and Govern
as unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they pleased: for they had a mighty support from that Court.
This made Princes more easily bear the Popes usurpations, because they were
assisted by them in all their other Proceedings. And the Friers, having the
Consciences of people generally in their hands as they had the word given by
their General at <hi>Rome,</hi> so they disposed people, either to be obedient,
or seditious, as they pleased.</p>
            <p>Now, not only their own Interests, mixed with their zeal for the
ancient Religion, but the Popes Authority, gave them as good a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to
encline the people to Rebel, as any had in former times, of whom some were
Canonized for the like practices. For in <hi>August</hi> the former year, the
Pope had Summoned the King to appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Ninety days, and to answer for
putting away his Queen, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another Wife; and for the Laws he had made
against the Church, and putting the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> and others to
death for not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying these Laws: and if he did not reform these faults, or
did not appear to answer for them, the Pope Excommunicated him, and all that
favoured him, deprived the King, put the Kingdom under an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict, forbade
all his Subjects to obey, and other States to hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with him,
dissolved all his Leagues with forreign Princes, commanded all the Clergy to
depart out of <hi>England,</hi> and his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to rise in Arms against him.
But now, the force of those Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which had formerly produced great
Earth-quakes and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was much abated; yet some storms were raised by
this, though not so violent as had been in former times.</p>
            <p>The people were quiet till they had reaped their Harvest.<note place="margin">The Kings injunctions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion.</note> And though some
Injunctions were published a little before, to help it the better forward, most
of the Holy days in Harvest being abolished by the Kings Authority; yet that
rather Inflamed them the more. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Injunctions were also published in the
Kings name by <hi>Cromwell</hi> his Vice-gerent, which was the first Act of
pure Supremacy done by the King. For in all that went before, he had the
Concurrence of the two Convocations. But these, it is like, were penned by
<hi>Cranmer.</hi> The Reader is referred to the Collection of Papers for them,
as I transcribed them out of the Register.</p>
            <q> 
               <p> The Substance of them was, that first, all Ecclesiastical
Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents were for a quarter of an year after that, once every Sunday,<note place="margin">Collect <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.</note> and ever after that, twice every
quarter, to publish to the people: That the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> usurped
Power, had no ground in the Law of God: and therefore was on good reasons
abolished in this Kingdom: And that the Kings Power was by the Law of God,
Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream over all persons in his Dominions. And they were to do their uttermost
endeavour, to extirpate the Popes Authority, and to establish the Kings.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They were to declare the Articles lately
published, and agreed to, by the Convocation: and to make the people know which
of them were Articles of Faith, and which of them Rules for the decent and
politick Order of the Church.</p> 
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:104314:136"/> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They were to declare the
Articles lately set forth, for the Abrogation of some superfluous Holy days,
particularly in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest time.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They were no more to extol Images or Relicks,
for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition or gain; nor to exhort people to make Pilgrimages, as if
blessings and good things were to be obtained of this or that Saint or Image.
But in stead of that, the people were to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to apply themselves to
the keeping of Gods Commandments, and doing works of Charity; and to believe
that God was better served by them, when they stayed at home and provided for
their Families, than when they went Pilgrimages: and that the Moneys laid out
on these, were better given to the poor.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They were to exhort the people to teach their
Children the Lords Prayer, the Creed, and the ten Commandments, in
<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>: and every Incumbent was to explain these, one Article a day,
till the people were Instructed in them. And to take great care, that all
Children were bred up to some trade or way of Living.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi>, They must take care that the Sacraments and
Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals be reverently administred in their Parishes, from which when at
any time they were absent, they were to Commit the Cure to a Learned and expert
Curate; who might instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in wholsome Doctrine: that they might
all see, that their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors did not pursue their own profits or interests, so
much as the Glory of God, and the good of the Souls under their Cure.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> They should not, except on urgent occasion,
go to Taverns or Ale-houses: nor sit too long at any sort of Games after their
Meals: but give themselves to the Study of the Scripture, or some other honest
exercise; and remember that they must excel others in purity of life, and be
examples to all others to live well and Christianly.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Because the goods of the Church, were the
goods of the poor; every Beneficed person that had twenty Pound or above, and
did not reside, was yearly to distribute the Fortieth part of his Benefice to
the poor of the Parish.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Every Incumbent that had an hundred Pound a
year, must give an Exhibition for one Schollar at some Grammar School, or
University; who after he had compleated his Studies, was to be Partner of the
Cure and Charge, both in Preaching, and other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And so many hundred
Pounds as any had, so many Students he was to breed up.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Where Parsonage or Vicarage-Houses were in
great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, the Incumbent was every year to give a fifth part of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
to the repairing of them, till they were finished; and then to maintain them in
the State they were in.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> All these Injunctions were to be observed,
under pain of suspension and sequestration of the mean profits till they were
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            </q>
            <p>These were equally ingrateful to the Corrupt Clergy, and to the
Laity that adhered to the old Doctrine.<note place="margin">Which were much
  censur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> The very same opinions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Pilgrimages, Images, and
Saints departed, and instructing the people in the Principles of Christian
Religion in the Vulgar tongue, <pb n="227" facs="tcp:104314:136"/> for which the
<hi>Lollards</hi> were not long ago, either burnt or forced to abjure them,
were now set up by the Kings Authority. From whence they concluded, that
whatsoever the King said of his maintaining the old Doctrine, yet he was now
changing it. The Clergy also were much troubled at this Precedent, of the Kings
giving such Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them, without the consent of the Convocation: From
which they concluded, they were now to be slaves to the Lord Vice-gerent. The
matter of these Injunctions was also very uneasie to them. The great profits
they made by their Images, and Relicks, and the Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to them, were now
taken away: and yet severe Impositions and heavy Taxes were laid on them; a
fifth part for Repairs, a tenth at least for an Exhibitioner, and a fortieth
for Charity, which were cryed out on as intolerable burdens. Their Labour was
also increased, and they were bound up to many severities of Life: All these
things touched the Secular Clergy to the quick, and made them concur with the
Regular Clergy in disposing the people to Rebel.</p>
            <p>This was secretly fomented by the great Abbots. For though they
were not yet struck at, yet the way was prepared to it; and their Houses were
oppressed with crouds of those who were sent to them from the suppressed
Houses. There was some pains taken to remove their fears. For a Letter was sent
to them all in the Kings name, to silence the reports that were spread abroad,
as if all Monasteries were to be quite suppressed. This they were required not
to believe but to serve God according to their Order, to obey the Kings
Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to keep Hospitality, and make no wastes nor dilapidations. Yet
this gave them small comfort; and as all such things do, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encreased than
quieted their jealousies and fears. So many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret causes concurring, no
wonder the people fell into mutinous and seditious practices.</p>
            <p>The first rising was in <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> in the beginning of
<hi>October,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Rebellion in
  <hi>Lincolnshire.</hi>
               </note> where a Church-man, disguised into a Cobler, and
directed by a Monk, drew a great body of men after him. About 20000 were
gathered together. They swore to be true, to God, the King, and the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and digested their Grievances into a few Articles, which they
sent to the King, desiring a redress of them.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>They complained of some things that related to secular concerns,
  and some Acts of Parliament that were uneasie to them:<note place="margin">Their
 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> They also complained of the suppression of so many Religious
  Houses: that the King had mean persons in high places about him, who were ill
  Councellors: They also complained of some Bishops who had subverted the Faith;
  and they apprehended the Jewels and Plate of their Churches, should be taken
  away. Therefore they desired the King would call to him the Nobility of the
  Realm, and by their advice redress their Grievances: Concluding with an
  acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kings being their Supream Head, and that the Tenthes and
  first Fruits of all Livings, belonged to him of Right.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the King heard of this Insurrection,<note place="margin">The
  Kings answer.</note> he presently sent the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> with a
Commission to raise forces for dispersing them: But with him he sent an answer
to their Petition. 
<q>He began with that about his Councellors, and said; It was never
  before heard of that the Rabble presumed to Dictate to their Prince, what
  Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors <pb n="228" facs="tcp:104314:137"/> he should choose. That was the Princes work
  and not theirs. The Suppression of Religious Houses was done pursuant to an Act
  of Parliament, and was not set forth by any of his Counsellors. The Heads of
  these Religious Houses, had under their own hands confessed those horrid
  scandals, which made them a reproach to the Nation. And in many Houses there
  were not above Four or Five Religious persons. So it seemed they were better
  pleased, that such dissolute persons should consume their Rents in riotous and
  idle living, than that their Prince should have them for the Common good of the
  whole Kingdom. He also answered their other Demands in the same high and
  commanding strain; and required them to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to his mercy, and to
  deliver their Captains and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants into the hands of his Lieutenants; and
  to disperse, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themselves as became good and obedient Subjects, and to
  put an hundred of their number into the hands of his Lieutenants, to be ordered
  as they had deserved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When this answer was brought to them, it raised their Spirits
higher. The practising Clergy-men continued to inflame them. They perswaded
them that the Christian Religion would be very soon defaced, and taken away
quite, if they did not vigorously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it: That it would come to that, that
no man should marry a Wife, receive any of the Sacraments, nor eat a piece of
rost meat, but he should pay for it: That it were better to live under the
<hi>Turk,</hi> than under such oppression. Therefore there was no cause in
which they could with more honour and a better conscience hazard their Lives,
than for the Holy Faith. This encouraged and kept them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a little
longer. They had forced many of the Gentry of the Countrey to go along with
them. These sent a secret Message to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> letting him
know what ill effects the Kings rough answer had produced: That they had joyned
with the people only to moderate them a little, and they knew nothing that
would be so effectual as the offer of a general pardon. So the Duke of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> as he moved towards them with the forces which he had drawn
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">It's quieted by the Duke of
  <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
               </note> sent to the King to know his pleasure, and earnestly
advised a gentle composing of the matter without blood. At that same time the
King was advertised from the North, that there was a general and formidable
Rising there. Of which he had the greater apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, because of their
neighbourhood to <hi>Scotland</hi>;<note place="margin">

               </note> whose King,
being the Kings Nephew, was the Heir presumptive of the Crown, since the King
had Illegitimated both his Daughters. And though the Kings firm Alliance with
<hi>France</hi> made him less apprehensive of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and their King was at this time in <hi>France,</hi> to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Daughter of
<hi>Francis</hi>; yet he did not know how far a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rising might invite
that King, to send orders to head and assist the Rebels in the North. Therefore
he resolved first to quiet <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnshire.</hi> And as he had raised a great
force about <hi>London,</hi> with which he was marching in person against them;
so he sent a new Proclamation, Requiring them to return to their obedience,
with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret assurances of mercy. By these means they were melted away. Those
who had been carryed in the Stream, submitted to the Kings mercy, and promised
all obedience for the future: Others, that were <pb n="229" facs="tcp:104314:137"/>
obstinate, and knew themselves unpardonable, fled Northward, and joyned
themselves to the Rebels there: Some of their other Leaders were apprehended,
in particular the Cobler, and were Executed.</p>
            <p>But for the Northern Rebellion, as the parties concerned, being at
a greater distance from the Court, had larger opportunities to gather
themselves into a huge Body; so the whole Contrivance of it was better laid.
One <hi>Ask</hi> Commanded in chief. He was a Gentleman of an ordinary
condition, but understood well how to draw on and Govern a Multitude. Their
march was called the <hi>Pilgrimage of Grace.</hi> And to inveigle the people,
some Priests marched before them with Crosses in their hands. In their Banners
they had a Crucifix with the Five wounds, and a Chalice: and every one wore on
his sleeve, as the badge of the Party, an Emblem of the Five wounds of Christ,
with the name <hi>Iesus</hi> wrought in the midst. All that joyned to them took
an Oath, 
<q>That they entered into this <hi>Pilgrimage of Grace,</hi> for
  the love of God, the preservation of the Kings person, and issue, the purifying
  the Nobility, and driving away all base born and ill Counsellors; and for no
  particular profit of their own, nor to do displeasure to any, nor to kill any
  for envy; but to take before them the Cross of Christ, his Faith, the
  Restitution of the Church, and the Suppression of Hereticks, and their
  opinions.</q> These were specious pretences,<note place="margin">Which grew very
  formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> and very apt to work upon a giddy and discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
multitude. So people flocked about their Crosses and Standards in great
numbers; and they grew to be 40000 strong. They went over the Countrey without
any great opposition. The Arch-Bishop of <hi>York</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Darcy</hi> were in <hi>Pomfret</hi> Castle; which they yielded to them, and
were made to swear their Covenant. They were both suspected of being secret
Promoters of the Rebellion: the latter suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for it, but how the former
excused himself I cannot give any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. They also took <hi>York,</hi> and
<hi>Hull</hi>; but though they summoned the Castle of <hi>Skipton,</hi> yet the
Earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> who would not degenerate from his Noble Ancestors,
held it out against all their force: and though many of the Gentlemen, whom he
had entertained at his own cost, deserted him, yet he made a brave resistance.
<hi>Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> Castle was also long besieged; but there Sir <hi>Ralph
Evers,</hi> that Commanded it, gave an un-exampled instance of his fidelity and
cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; for though his provisions fell short, so that for twenty days he and
his men had nothing but bread and water, yet they stood out till they were
relieved.</p>
            <p>This Rising in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> encouraged those of
<hi>Lancashire,</hi> the Bishoprick of <hi>Duresm,</hi> and
<hi>Westmoreland,</hi> to Arm. Against these the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
that he might not fall short of the Gallantry and Loyalty of his renownd
Ancestors, made head: though he had no Commission from the King. But he knew
his zeal and fidelity would easily procure him a pardon, which he modestly
asked for the service he had done. The King sent him not only that, but a
Commission to command in chief all his forces in the North. To his Assistance
he ordered the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> to march; and sent <hi>Courtney</hi>
Marquess of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Earls of <hi>Huntington,</hi> and
<hi>Rutland,</hi> to joyn him. He also order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
with the force that he had led into <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> to lye still there;
lest they, being but newly quieted, should <pb n="230" facs="tcp:104314:138"/> break out
again, and fall upon his Armies behind; when the <hi>Yorkshire</hi> men met
them before.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and others sent
  a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</note>On the 20th of <hi>October,</hi> he sent the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk</hi> with more forces to joyn the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>: But
the Rebels were very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and desperate. When the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
understood their strength, he saw great reason to proceed with much caution:
for if they had got the least advantage of the Kings Troops, all the
discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in <hi>England</hi> would upon the report of that have broken out.
He saw their numbers were now such, that the gaining some time was their ruin:
for such a great Body could not subsist long together, without much provisions;
and that must be very hard for them to bring in: So he set forward a Treaty. It
was both honourable for the King to offer mercy to his distracted Subjects, and
of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to his affairs: for as their numbers did every day lessen;
so the Kings forces were still encreasing. He wrote to the King, that
considering the season of the year, he thought the offering some fair
conditions might perswade them to lay down their Arms, and disperse themselves:
Yet when the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> sent a Herald with a Proclamation,
ordering them to lay down their Arms, and submit to the Kings mercy;
<hi>Ask</hi> received him sitting in State, with the Arch-Bishop on the one
hand, and the Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> on the other, but would not suffer any
Proclamation to be made, till he knew the Contents of it. And when the Herauld
told what they were, he sent him away without suffering him to publish it. And
then the Priests used all their endeavours, to engage the people to a firm
resolution of not dispersing themselves, till all matters about Religion were
fully setled.</p>
            <p>As they went forward, they every-where repossessed the ejected
Monks of their Houses; and this encouraged the rest, who had a great mind to be
in their old Nests again. They published also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stories among them of the
growing burdens of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and made them believe that Impositions would be laid on every
thing that was either bought or sold. But the King hearing how strong they
were, sent out a general Summons to all the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to meet him at
<hi>Northampton</hi> the 7th of <hi>November.</hi> And the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces sent against
the Rebels advanced to <hi>Doncaster,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They advance to
  <hi>Doncaster.</hi>
               </note> to hinder them from coming further southward; and
took the Bridge, which they fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and laid their forces along the River
to maintain that Pass.</p>
            <p>The Writers of that time say, that the day of Battel was agreed
on; but that the night before, excessive Rains falling, the River swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so,
that it was unpassable next day, and they could not force the Bridge. Yet it is
not likely the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> having in all but 5000 men about
him, would agree to a pitched Battel with those who were Six times his number,
being then 30000. Therefore it is more likely that the Rebels only intended to
pass the River the next day, which the Rain that fell hindred: But the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk</hi> continued to press a Treaty, which was hearkned to by the
other side; who were reduced to great straits; for their Captain would not
suffer them to spoyl the Countrey, and they were no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to subsist
without doing that. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> directed some that were
secretly gained, or had been sent over to them as <pb facs="tcp:104314:138"/> Deserters, to
spread reports among them; that their Leaders were making Terms for themselves,
and would leave the rest to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. This joyned to their necessities, made
many fall off every day. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> finding his Arts had so
good an operation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go to Court,<note place="margin">The
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays.</note> with
any whom they would send with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and to intercede for them. This
he knew would take up some time, and most of them would be dispersed before he
could return. So they sent two Gentlemen, whom they had forced to go with them,
to the King to <hi>Windsor.</hi> Upon this, the King discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rendezvous
at <hi>Northampton,</hi> and delayed the sending an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer as much as could
be: But at last, hearing that though most of them were dispersed; yet they had
engaged to return upon warning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they took it ill that no answer
came; he sent the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> to them with a general pardon, six
only excepted by name, and four others that were not named. But in this the
Kings Counsels were generally censured, for every one was now in fear, and so
the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels rejected the Proposition. 
<q>The King also sent them word by their own Messenger That he took
  it very ill at their hands, that they had chosen rather to rise in Arms against
  him, than to Petition him about these things which were uneasie to them.</q>
And to appease them a little, the King by new Injunctions, commanded the
Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to continue the use of all the Ceremonies of the Church. This, it is
like, was intended for keeping up the four Sacraments, which had not been
mentioned in the former Articles. The Clergy, that were with the Rebels, met at
<hi>Pomfret</hi> to draw up Articles to be offered at the Treaty that was to be
at <hi>Doncaster</hi>: where three hundred were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to come from the
Rebels to treat with the Kings Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. So great a number was called, in
hopes that they would disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree about their Demands, and so fall out among
themselves. On the 6th of <hi>December</hi> they met to treat, and it seems had
so laid their matter before, that they agreed upon these following Demands.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>A general Pardon to be granted: a Parliament to be held at
  <hi>York</hi>; and Courts of justice to be there; that none on the North of
  <hi>Trent</hi> might be brought to <hi>London</hi> upon any Law-sute. They
  desired a Repeal of some Acts of Parliament:<note place="margin">Their
 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> Those for the last Subsidy, for uses, for making words
  misprision of Treason, and for the Clergies paying their Tenthes and first
  Fruits to the King. They desired the Princess <hi>Mary</hi> might be restored
  to her right of Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; the Pope to his wonted Jurisdiction and the Monks
  to their Houses again: that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> might be punished, that
  <hi>Audley</hi> the Lord Chancellor, and <hi>Cromwell</hi> the Lord Privy-Seal,
  might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the next Parliament; and <hi>Lee</hi> and
  <hi>Leighton,</hi> that had visited the Monasteries, might be imprisoned for
  Bribery and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the Lords, who knew that the King would by no means agree to
these Propositions, rejected them. Upon which the Rebels took heart again, and
were growing more enraged and desperate; so that the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
wrote to the King, that if some content were not given them, it might end very
ill, for they were much stronger than his Forces were: And both he, and the
other Commanders of the Kings Forces, in their hearts wished that most of their
Demands were <pb facs="tcp:104314:139"/> granted; being persons, who though they complied
with the King, and were against that Rebellion, yet were great Enemies to
<hi>Lutheranism,</hi> and wished a Reconciliation with <hi>Rome</hi>; of which
the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> was afterwards accused by the Lord
<hi>Darcy,</hi> as if he had secretly encouraged them to insist on these
Demands. The King seeing the humour was so obstinate, resolved to use gentler
Remedies; and so sent to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> a general Pardon, with a
promise of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ordering him not to make use of these, except in
extremity. This was no easie thing to that Duke, since he might be afterwards
made to answer for it, whether the extremity was really such, as to justifie
his granting these things. But the Rebels were become again as numerous as
ever, and had resolved to cross the River, and to force the Kings Camp, which
was still much inferiour to theirs in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But Rains falling the second
time, made the Foords again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passable. This was spoken of by the Kings Party,
as little less than a a Miracle, that Gods Providence had twice so opportunely
interposed for the stopping of the progress of the Rebels: And it is very
probable that on the other side, it made great impression on the Superstitious
multitude; and both discouraged them, and disposed them, to accept of the offer
of Pardon, and a Parliament to be soon called, for consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their other
Demands. The King signed the Pardon at <hi>Richmond,</hi> the 9th of
<hi>December</hi>: by which all their Treasons and Rebellion to that day, were
pardoned, provided they made their submission to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
and the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and lived in all due obedience for the
future. 
<q>The King sent likewise a long answer to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,<note place="margin">The Kings answer to them.</note> as to what they complained about
  the subversion of the Faith; He protested his zeal for the true Christian
  Faith, and that he would live and die in the defence and preservation of it.
  But the ignorant multitude were not to instruct him what the true Faith was,
  nor to presume to correct what he and the whole Convocation had agreed on. That
  as he had preserved the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her true Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, so
  he would do still; and that he had done nothing that was so oppressive, as many
  of his Progenitours had done upon lesser grounds. But that he took it very ill
  of them, who had rather one Churl or two should enjoy the Profits of their
  Monasteries, to support them in their dissolute and abominable course of
  living, than that their King should have them for defraying the great Charge he
  was at for their defence against Forreign Enemies. For the Laws, it was high
  presumption in a rude multitude to take on them to judge what Laws were good,
  and what not. They had more reason to think, that he after twenty eight years
  Reign should know it better than they could. And for his Government, he had so
  long preserved his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in Peace and Justice, had so defended them from
  their Enemies, had so secured his Frontier, had granted so many general
  Pardons, had been so unwilling to punish his Subjects, and so ready to receive
  them into mercy; that they could shew no paralel to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among all
  their former Kings. And whereas it was said, That he had many of the Nobility
  of his Council, in the beginning of his Reign, and few now; he shewed them in
  that one instance how they were abused by the lying slanders of some
  disaffected Persons: For when he came to the Crown, there were none that were
  born <pb n="233" facs="tcp:104314:139"/> Noble, of his Council, but only the Earl of
  <hi>Surrey,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>; whereas now, the Dukes of
  <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the
  Lord <hi>Steward,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Sussex,</hi> and
  the Lord <hi>Sands,</hi> were of the Privy-Council: And for the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality,
  the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Winchester,
  Hereford</hi> and <hi>Chichester,</hi> were also of it: And he and his whole
  Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil judging it necessary to have some at the board who understood the Law
  of <hi>England,</hi> and the Treaties with Forreign Princes; he had by their
  Unanimous advice brought in his Chancellor, and the Lord Privy-Seal. He thought
  it strange, that they who were but brutes, should think they could better judg
  who should be his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors than himself and his whole Council: Therefore he
  would bear no such thing at their hands; it being inconsistent with the duty of
  good Subjects, to meddle in such matters. But if they or any of his other
  Subjects, could bring any just complaint against any about him, he was ready to
  hear it; and if it were proved, he would punish it according to Law. As for the
  complaints against some of the Prelates for preaching against the Faith, they
  could know none of these things but by the report of others; since they lived
  at such a distance, that they themselves had not heard any of them preach.
  Therefore he required them not to give credit to Lies, nor be misled by those
  who spread such Calumnies and ill reports: And he concluded all with a severe
  Expostulation; adding that such was his love to his Subjects, that imputing
  this Insurrection, rather to their folly and lightness, than to any malice or
  rancour, he was willing to pass it over more gently, as they would perceive by
  his Proclamation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now the people were come to themselves again, and glad to get off
so easily; and they all chearfully accepted the Kings offers,<note place="margin">1537.</note> and went home again to their several dwellings.<note place="margin">The Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is quieted.</note> Yet the Clergy were no way
satisfied, but continued still to practise amongst them, and kept the Rebellion
still on foot; so that it broke out soon after. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
and the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> were ordered to lie still in the Country
with their Forces, till all things were more fully composed. They made them all
come to a full submission; and first, to revoke all Oaths and Promises made,
during the Rebellion, for which they asked the Kings Pardon on their knees;
2ly, To swear to be true to the King, and his Heirs and Successors; 3ly, To
obey and maintain all the Acts of Parliament made during the Kings Reign. 4ly,
Not to take Arms again but by the Kings Authority. 5ly, To apprehend all
Seditious persons. 6ly, To remove all the Monks, Nuns, and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, whom they
had placed again in the dissolved Monasteries. There were also Orders given to
send <hi>Ask</hi> their Captain, and the Lord <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> to Court.
<hi>Ask</hi> was kindly received, and well used by the King. He had shewed
great conduct in Commanding the Rebels; and it seems the King had a mind,
either to gain him to his service, or, which I suspect was the true Cause, to
draw from him a discovery of all those, who, in the other parts of the Kingdom,
had favoured or relieved them. For he suspected, not without cause, that some
of the great Abbots had given secret supplies of Money to the Rebels: For which
many of them were afterwards tryed and attainted. The Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> was
under great apprehensions, and studied to purge <pb n="234" facs="tcp:104314:140"/>
himself,<note place="margin">1537.</note> that he was forced to a Compliance with
them; but plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the long and important services, he had done the Crown
for fifty years, he being then fourscore, together with his great Age and
Infirmity, might mitigate the Kings displeasure. But he was made Prisoner.
Whether this gave those who had been in Arms, new jealousies, that the Kings
Pardon would not be inviolably observed; or whether the Clergy had of new,
prevailed on them to rise in Arms, I cannot determine: But it broke out again,
though not so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously as before.<note place="margin">New risings but soon
  dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed.</note> Two Gentlemen of the North, <hi>Musgrave</hi> and
<hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> raised a body of 8000 men; and thought to have surprised
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisle</hi>; but were repulsed by those within. And in their return the
Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> fell upon them, and routed them. He took many
prisoners, and by Martial Law hanged up all their Captains, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty other
Prisoners on the Walls of <hi>Carlisle.</hi> Others at that same time thought
to have surprised <hi>Hull</hi>; but it was prevented, and the leaders of that
Party were also taken and Executed.</p>
            <p>Many other Risings were in several places of the Countrey, which
were all soon repressed; the ground of them all was, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which
was promised, was not called: But the King said, they had not kept conditions
with him, nor would he call a Parliament till all things were quieted. But the
Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> vigilance every-where, prevented their gathering
together in any great Body. And after several un-succesful attempts, at length
the Countrey was absolutely quieted in <hi>Ianuary</hi> following. And then the
Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> proceeded according to the Martial Law against many
whom he had taken. <hi>Ask</hi> had also left the Court without leave, and had
gone amongst them, but was quickly taken. So he and many others were sent to
several places, to be made publick Examples. He suffered at <hi>York,</hi>
others at <hi>Hull,</hi> and in other Towns in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi> But the Lord
<hi>Darcy,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Hussy,</hi> were arraigned at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> and attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Treason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The former for the
Northern, and the other for the <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> Insurrection. The Lord
<hi>Darcy</hi> was beheaded at <hi>Towerhill</hi>; and was much lamented.<note place="margin">The chief of the Rebels ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted.</note> Every body thought that
considering his Merits, his Age, and former services, he had hard measure. The
Lord <hi>Hussy</hi> was beheaded at <hi>Lincoln.</hi> The Lord <hi>Darcy</hi>
in his Tryal, accused the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>; that in the Treaty at
<hi>Doncaster,</hi> he had encouraged the Rebels to continue in their demands.
This the Duke denyed, and desired a Tryal by Combate, and gave some
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions to shew that the Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> bore him ill-will, and said
this out of Malice. The King either did not believe this, or would not seem to
believe it: And the Dukes great diligence in the Suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of these
Commotions set him beyond all jealousies. But after those Executions, the King
wrote to the Duke in <hi>Iuly</hi> next, to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim an absolute Amnesty over
all the North; which was received with great joy, every body being in fear of
himself: and so this threatning storm was dissipated without the effusion of
much blood, save what the sword of justice drew. At the same time the King of
<hi>Scotland</hi> returning from <hi>France</hi> with his Queen, and touching
on the Coast of <hi>England</hi>; many of the people fell down at his feet,
praying him to assist them, and he should have all. But he was, it seems, bound
up by the <hi>French</hi> King: and so went home without giving them 
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104314:140"/> any encouragement. And thus ended this Rebellion, which
was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carryed on by the Clergy, under pretence of Religion.</p>
            <p>And now the King was delivered of all his apprehensions that he
had been in, for some years in fear of Stirs at home.<note place="margin">A new
  Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries.</note> But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now happily composed; as he
knew it would so overawe the rest of his discontented Subjects, that he needed
fear nothing from them for a great while; so it encouraged him to go on in his
other designs, of suppressing the rest of the Monasteries, and reforming some
other Points of Religion. Therefore there was a new Visitation appointed for
all the Monasteries of <hi>England.</hi> And the Visiters were ordered, to
Examine all things that related either to their Conversation, to their
affection to the King, and the Supremacy, or to their Superstition, in their
several Houses: To discover what Cheats and Impostures there were, either in
their Images, Relicks, or other miraculous things, by which they had drawn
people to their Houses on Pilgrimages, and gotten from them any great Presents.
Also to try how they were affected during the late Commotions, and to discover
every thing that was amiss in them, and report it to the Lord Vice-gerent. In
the Records of the whole Twenty Eighth year of the Kings Reign, I find but one
Original Surrender of any Religious House. The Abbot of <hi>Furnese</hi> in
<hi>Lincolnshire</hi> valued at 960 <hi>lib.</hi> with Thirty Monks resigning
up that House to the King, on the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> which was very near
the end of the year of the Kings Reign, for it commenced on the 22d of
<hi>April.</hi> Two other Surrenders are enrolled that year. The one was of
<hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondsey</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> the first of <hi>Iune</hi> in the
twenty eighth of the Kings Reign. The Preamble was, that they Surrendred in
hopes of greater Benevolence from the King. But this was the effect of some
secret practice, and not of the Act of Parliament. For it was valued at 548
<hi>lib.</hi> and so fell not within the Act. The other was of
<hi>Bushlisham</hi> or <hi>Bishtam</hi> in <hi>Berkshire,</hi> made by
<hi>Barlow</hi> Bishop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> that was Commendator of it, and
a great Promoter of the Reformation. It was valued at 327 <hi>lib.</hi> But in
the following year they made a quicker Progress, and found strange Enormities
in the greater Houses. It seems all the Houses under 200 <hi>lib.</hi> of Rent
were not yet suppressed. For I find many within that value afterwards resigning
their Houses. So that I am enclined to believe, that the first visitation being
made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Suppression of the lesser Monasteries, and that (as appears
by their Instructions) being not to be finished till they had made a report of
what they had done to the Court of Augmentations, who were after the report
made to determine what pensions were to be reserved to the Abbot and other
Officers; (which report was to be made in the Octaves of St. <hi>Michael,</hi>
and after that, a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was to be given for their Suppression;) when
that was done, they went no further at that time, that so I cannot think there
were many Houses Suppressed when these Stirres began: and after their first
rising, it is not likely that great Progress would be made in a business that
was like to inflame the people more, and encrease the number of the Rebels.
Neither do I find any Houses suppressed by vertue of the former Act of
Parliament till the twenty ninth year of the Kings Reign.<note place="margin">Some of the great Abbots surrender their Houses.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And yet they made no great hast this year. For there are but 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:104314:141"/> twenty one Surrenders all this year, either in the
Rolls, or Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation-Office. And now, not only small Abbeys, but greater
ones, were surrendred to the King. The Abbots were brought to do it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
several Motives. Some had been faulty during the late Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and were
liable to the Kings displeasure: and these, to redeem themselves, compounded
the matter by a Resignation of their House. Others began to like the
Reformation, and that made them the more willing to surrender their Houses:
such as <hi>Barlow</hi> Bishop of St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi> who not only
surrendered up his own House of <hi>Bushlisham,</hi> but prevailed on many
others to do the like: Others were convicted of great disorders in their
Conversation; and these not daring to stand a Tryal, were glad to accept of a
Pension for life, and deliver up their House. Others were guilty of making
great wastes and Dilapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. For they all saw the Dissolution of their
Houses approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and so every one was induced to take all the care he could
to provide for himself, and his kindred; so that the Visitors found in some of
the Richest Abbies of <hi>England,</hi> as St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and
<hi>Battell,</hi> such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations made, that at St. <hi>Albans</hi> an Abbot
could not subsist any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the rents were so low; and in <hi>Battell,</hi>
as all their furniture was old and torn, not worth an 100 <hi>lib.</hi> so both
in House and Chappel, they had not 400 Marks worth of Plate. In other Houses
they found not above twelve or fifteen Ounces of Plate, and no furniture at
all, but only such things as they could not embezel; as the Walls, and Windows,
Bells, and Lead. In other Houses, the Abbot and Monks were glad to accept of a
Pension for themselves during life: and so being only concerned for their own
particular interest, resigned their House to the King. Generally, the Monks had
eight Marks a year Pension, till they were provided for. The Abbots Pensions
were proportioned to the Value of their House, and to their Innocence. The
Abbots of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> had 400 Marks a year a
piece. The Abbot of St. <hi>Edmundsbury</hi> was more Innocent, for the
Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors wrote from thence, that they could find no scandals in that House: So
he (it seems) was not easily brought to Resign his House, and had 500 Marks
Pension reserved to him. And for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Officers some had 30. some 10.
or 8. and the lowest 6 <hi>lib.</hi> Pension.</p>
            <p>In other places, upon a vacancy, either by death, or deprivation,
they did put in an Abbot only to resign up the House. For after the Kings
Supremacy was established, all those Abbots that had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly confirmed
by the Pope, were placed in this manner. The King granted a <hi>Conge
d'elire</hi> to the Prior and Convent, with a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Letter, declaring the
name of the person whom they should choose: then they returned an election to
the King, who, upon that, gave his assent to it by a Warrant under the great
Seal, which was certified to the Lord Vice-gerent; who thereupon Confirmed the
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and returned him back to the King, to take the Oaths: upon which,
the Temporalities were restored. Thus all the Abbots were now placed by the
King, and were generally pickt out to serve this turn. Others, in hope of
advancement to Bishopricks, or to be Suffragan Bishops, as the inferior sort of
them were made generally, were glad to recommend themselves to the Kings
favour, by a quick and cheerful Surrender of their Monasterie. Upon some of
these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements <pb n="237" facs="tcp:104314:141"/> it was,<note place="margin">1538.</note> that the greatest number of the Religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were resigned to the King, before there was any Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made for
their Suppression. In several Houses, the Visitors, who were generally, either
Masters of Chancery, or Auditors of the Court of Augmentations, studied not
only to bring them to resign their Houses, but to Sign Confessions of their
passed lewd and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute lives. Of these, there is only one now extant, which
(it is like) escaped the general rasure and destruction of all Papers of that
kind, in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time. But from the Letters that I have seen, I
perceive there were such Confessions made by many other Houses. That Confession
of the Prior and Benedictins of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
is to be seen in the Records of the Court of Augmentations. 
<q>In which,<note place="margin">Confessions of horrid Crimes made in
 several Houses.</note> with the most aggravating expressions that could be
  devised, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their past ill life, for which the Pitt of Hell was
  ready to swallow them up. They confessed that they had neglected the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
  of God, lived in Idleness, Gluttony, and Sensuality, with many other woful
  expressions to that purpose.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Other Houses, as the Monastery of <hi>Betlesden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collect <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 4.</note> resigned with
this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, 
<q>That they did profoundly consider, that the manner and trade of
  living, which they, and others of their pretended Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had for a long
  time followed, consisted in some dumb ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and other Constitutions, of
  the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other forreign Potentates; as the Abbot of
  <hi>Cisteaux,</hi> by which they were blindly led, having no true knowledg of
  Gods Laws; procuring exemptions from their Ordinary and Diocesan, by the Power
  of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and submitting themselves wholly to a forreign
  Power, who never came hither to reform their abuses, which were now found among
  them. But that now knowing the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way of living is sufficiently
  declared by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; and that it was most fit for them to be
  Governed by the King, who was their Supream Head on earth; they Submitted
  them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to his Mercy, and surrendered up their Monastery to him on the 25th
  of <hi>September</hi> in the 30th year of his Reign.</q> This writing was
signed by the Abbot, the Sub-prior, and nine Monks. There are five other
Surrenders to the same purpose; by the <hi>Gray,</hi> and <hi>White
Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars</hi> of <hi>Stamford,</hi> the <hi>Gray-Friars</hi> of <hi>Coventry,
Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> yet to be seen. Some are resigned upon
this Preamble, 
<q>That they hoped the King would of new found their House; which
  was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise like to be ruined, both in Spirituals and Temporals.</q> So did
the Abbot of <hi>Chertsey</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> with fourteen Monks, on the
14th of <hi>Iuly</hi> in the 29th year of this Reign, whose House was valued at
744 <hi>lib.</hi> I have some reason to think that this Abbot was for the
Reformation, and intended to have had his House new founded to be a House of
true and well regulated devotion: And so I find the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of great
<hi>Malverine</hi> in <hi>Worcestershire</hi> offered such a Resignation. He
was recommended by Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> with an
earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that his House might stand, <hi>not in Monkery, but so as to be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Preaching, Study, and Prayer.</hi> And the good Prior was
wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to compound for his House by a Present of 500 Marks to the King, and
of 200 to <hi>Cromwell.</hi> He is commended, for being an old wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, a
good Housekeeper, and one that daily fed many poor <pb n="238" facs="tcp:104314:142"/>
people. To this <hi>Latimer</hi> adds; <hi>Alas my good Lord! Shall we not see
Two or Three in every shire changed to such remedy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Resolution was taken once to extirpate all. And therefore
though the Visitors interceded earnestly for one Nunnery in <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,
Godstow,</hi> where there was great strictness of life; and to which were most
of the young Gentlewomen of the County were sent to be bred; so that the
Gentrey of the Country desired the King would spare the House, yet all was
uneffectual.</p>

not so well like this preamble; and therefore did, without any reason or
preamble, give away their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to the Visitors, as Feofees in trust for the
Kings use. And thus they went on, procuring daily more surrenders. So that in
the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of the Kings Reign there were 159 Resignations enrolled, of
which the Originals of 155 do yet remain. And for the Readers further
satisfaction,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi>

of all these Houses so surrendred, with other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars relating to them,
which would too much weary him, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in the thread of this Work. But
there was no Law to force any to make such Resignations. So that many of the
great Abbots would not comply with the King in this matter, and stood it out
till after the following Parliament that was in the 31th year of his Reign.</p>
            <p>It was questioned by many, whether these surrenders could be good
in Law, since the Abbots were but Trustees and Tenants for Life. It was thought
they could not absolutely alienate, and give away their House for ever. But the
Parliament afterwards declared the Resignations were good in Law. For by their
Foundations all was trusted to the Abbot and the Senior Brethren of the House;
who putting the Covent-Seal to any Deed, it was of force in Law. It was also
said,<note place="margin">Divers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about these.</note> that they thus
surrendering, had forfeited their Charters and Foundations; and so the King
might seize and possess them with a good Title, if not upon the Resignation,
yet upon Forfeiture. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thought, that, whatsoever the Nicety of Law
might give the King, yet there was no sort of equity in it, that a few
Trustees, who were either bribed, or frighted, should pass away that which was
none of theirs, but only given them in Trust and for Life. Other Abbots were
more roughly handled.<note place="margin">Some Abbots attainted of
  Treason.</note> The Prior of <hi>Wooburn</hi> was suspected of favouring the
Rebels, of being against the Kings Supremacy, and for the Popes; and of being
for the General Council then summoned to <hi>Mantua.</hi> And he was dealt with
to make a submission and acknowledgment. In an account of a long Conference
which he had with a Privy Counsellor under his own hand, I find that the great
thing which he took of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at, was, That <hi>Latimer</hi> and some other
Bishops preached against the Veneration of the Blessed Virgin, and the other
Saints: and that the <hi>English</hi> Bible then set out, differed in many
things from the <hi>Latin</hi>; with several lesser matters. So that they
looked on their Religion as <pb n="239" facs="tcp:104314:142"/> changed, and wondered that
the Judgments of God upon Queen <hi>Anne</hi> had not terrified others from
going on to subvert the Faith: yet he was prevailed with, and did again submit
to the King, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg his Supremacy; but he afterwards joyned himself to
the Rebels and was taken with them, together with the Abbot of
<hi>Wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and two Monks of his House; and the Abbot of
<hi>Gervanx,</hi> with a monk of his House; and the Abbot of <hi>Sawley</hi> in
<hi>Lancashire,</hi> with the Prior of that House; and the Prior of
<hi>Burlington</hi>; who were all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of High Treason, and Executed. The
Abbots of <hi>Glastenbury</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> were men of great power
and Wealth. The one was rated at 3508. <hi>lib.</hi> and the the other at 2116.
<hi>lib.</hi> They seeing the storm like to break out on themselves, sent a
great deal of the Plate and Money that they had in their House, to the Rebels
in the North. Which being afterwards discovered, they were attainted of High
Treason a year after this; but I mention it here for the affinity of the
matter: Further particulars about the Abbot of <hi>Reading</hi> I have not yet
discovered. But there is an account given to <hi>Cromwel</hi> of the
procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings against the Abbot of <hi>Glastenbury</hi> in two Letters which I
have seen, the one was writ by the Sheriff of the County, the other by Sir
<hi>Iohn Russell,</hi> who was present at his Trial, and was reputed a man of
as great Integrity and Virtue as any in that time; which he seems to have left
as an inheritance to that Noble Family that has descended from him. These
inform, that he was indicted of Burglary, as well as Treason; for having broken
the House in his Monastery where the Plate was kept, and taken it out, which as
Sir <hi>William Thomas</hi> says, was sent to the Rebels. The evidence being
brought to the Jury, who (as Sir <hi>Iohn Russel</hi> writes,) were as good and
worthy men as had ever been on any Jury in that County; they found him guilty.
He was carried to the place of Execution, near his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery; where (as
the Sheriff writes) he acknowledged his guilt, and begged God and the King
pardon for it. The Abbot of <hi>Colchester</hi> was also attainted of High
Treason. What the particulars were I cannot tell. For the Record of their
Attainders was lost; But some of our own Writers deservs a severe censure, who
Write it was for denying the King Supremacy; whereas, if they had not
undertaken to write the History without any information at all, they must have
seen that the whole Clergy, but most particularly the Abbots, had over and over
again acknowledged the Kings Supremacy.</p>
            <p>For clearing which and discovering the Impudence of
<hi>Sanders</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this matter, I shall lay before the Reader, the
Evidences that I find of the Submission of these and all the other Abbots to
the Kings Supremacy: First, in the Convocation, in the 22d year of this Reign,
they all acknowledged the King, <hi>Supream Head of the Church of England.</hi>
They did all also swear to maintain the Act of the Succession of the Crown,
made in the 25th year of his Reign, in which the Popes Power was plainly
condemned. For in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against <hi>More and Fisher,</hi> it was
frequently repeated to them, that all the Clergy had sworn it. It is also
entred in the Journal of the House of Lords, that all the members of both
Houses swore it at their breaking up: And the same Journals inform us, that the
Abbots of <hi>Colchester</hi> and <hi>Reading</hi> sate in that Parliament, and
as <pb n="240" facs="tcp:104314:143"/> there was no Protestation made against any of the
Acts passed in that Session,<note place="margin">1537.</note> so it is often
entred, that the Acts were agreed to by the Unanimous consent of the Lords. It
appears also by several Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Letters, that the heads of all the Religious
Houses in <hi>England</hi> had Signed that Position, <hi>that the Pope had no
more Iurisdiction in this Kingdom, than any forreign Bishop whatsoever.</hi>
And it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by none but some <hi>Carthusians,</hi> and
<hi>Franciscans</hi> of the <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> who were proceeded against,
for refusing to acknowledg it: When they were so pressed in it, none can
imagine that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Abbot would have been dispenced with. And in the
last Parliament, in which the second Oath about the Succession to the Crown was
enacted, it was added, that they should also swear the King to be the Supream
head of the Church. The Abbots of <hi>Glassenbury</hi> and <hi>Reading</hi>
were then present, as appears by the Journals, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to it: So little
reason there is for Imagining that they refus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, or any other Complyance
that might secure them in their Abbies.</p>
            <p>In particular, the Abbot of <hi>Reading</hi> had so got into
<hi>Cromwels</hi> good opinion, that in some differences between him and
<hi>Shaxton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that was <hi>Cromwels</hi>
creature, he had the better of the Bishop. Upon which, <hi>Shaxton,</hi> who
was a proud ill-natured man, wrote an high expostulating Letter to
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> 
               <q>Complaining of an Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he had granted against him at the
  Abbots desire. He also shewed that in some contests between him and his
  Residentiaries, and between him and the Major of <hi>Salisbury, Cromwel</hi>
  was always against him: he likewise challenged him, for not answering his
  Letters. He tells him, God will judge him for abusing his Power as he did; he
  prays God to have pity on him, and to turn his heart, with a great deal more
  provoking Language.</q> He also adds many insolent praises of himself; and his
whole Letter is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant a piece of vanity and insolence, as ever I saw.
To this <hi>Cromwel</hi> wrote an answer, that shews him to have been indeed a
great man. The Reader will find it in the Collection, and see from it how
modestly and discreetly he carryed his Greatness.<note place="margin">Collect.

            </p>
            <p>But how justly soever these Abbots were attainted, the seizing on
their Abbey-Lands, pursuant to those Attainders, was thought a great stretch of
Law; since the Offence of an Ecclesiastical Incumbent is a Personal thing, and
cannot prejudice the Church; no more than a secular man, who is in an Office,
does by being Attainted, bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diminution of the Rights of his Office on
his successors. It is true there were some words cast into the thirteenth Act
of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in the 26th year of this Reign, by which divers Offences
were made Treason, that seemed to have been designed for such a purpose. The
words are, that whatsoever Lands any Traytor had <hi>of any Estate of
Inheritance in use or possession, by any Right, Title or Means,</hi> should be
forfeited to the King. By which, as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Estates in Tayl were
comprehended, so the Lands that any Traytor had in Possession or use, seem to
be included; and that the rather, because by some following words their heirs
and Successors are for ever excluded. This either was not thought on when the
Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> was Attainted, or perhaps was not claimed, since 
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:104314:143"/> the King intended not to lessen the number of
Bishopricks, but rather to increase them. Besides, the words of the Statute
seem only to belong to an <hi>Estate of Inheritance</hi>: within which,
Church-Benefices could not be included, without a great force put on them. 'Tis
true the word <hi>Successor</hi> favoured these seisures, except that be
thought an expletory word put in, out of form, but still to be limited to an
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of Inheritance. That word does also import, that such Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals might
have successors. But if the whole Abbey was forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, these Abbots could have
no successors: Yet it seems the seizures of these Abbeys were founded on that
Statute, and this stretch of the Law occasioned that Explanation, which was
added of the words <hi>Estate of Inheritance,</hi> in the Statute made in
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Reign about Treasons: Where it is expressed, that
Traitors should forfeit to the Crown, what Lands they had of any <hi>Estate of
Inheritance,</hi> to which is added <hi>in their own Right,</hi> it seems, on
design to cut off all Pretence for such Proceedings for the future, as had been
in this Reign. But if there was any Illegality in these seizures, the following
Parliament did at least tacitly Justifie them. For they excepted out of the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visos made concerning the Abbies that were suppressed, such as had been
<hi>forfeited and seized on by any Attaindors of Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Surrender is not unlike these, but rather less
Justifiable. Many of the <hi>Carthusian</hi> Monks of <hi>London</hi> were
executed for their open denying of the Kings Supremacy, and for receiving Books
from forreign parts against his Marriage and other proceedings; divers also of
the same House, that favoured them, but so secretly, that clear proof could not
be found to convict them, were kept Prisoners in their Cells, till they dyed.
But the Prior was a worthy man, of whom <hi>Thomas Bedyl,</hi> one of the
Visitors, writes, <hi>that he was a man of such Charity that he had not seen
the like, and that the eyes of the people were much on that House, and
therefore he advised that the House might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to some good use.</hi>
But the Prior was made to resign, with this Preamble, 
<q>That many of that House had offended the King, so that their
  goods might be justly confiscated, and themselves adjudged to a severe death:
  which they desired to avoid, by an humble Submission, and Surrender of their
  House to the King.</q> But there were great Complaints made of the Visitors, as
if they had practised with the Abbots and Priors to make these Surrenders: and
that they had conspired with them to cheat the King, and had private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
embezeled most of the Plate and furniture. The Abbess of <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow</hi>
complained in particular of Doctor <hi>London</hi> one of the Visitors, that he
had been corrupting her Nuns: and generally it was cryed out on, that
under-hand and ill practices were used. Therefore to quiet these reports, and
to give some colour to justifie what they were about, all the foul Stories that
could be found out were published to defame these Houses. <hi>Battel</hi>-Abbey
was represented to be a little <hi>Sodom</hi>; so was Christ Church in
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> with several other Houses. But for Whoredom and Adultery
they found Instances without number; and of many other unnatural practices and
secret Lusts, with arts to hinder Conceptions and make Abortions. But no story
became so publick, as a discovery made of the Prior of the <hi>Crossed
Friars</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; who on a Friday at eleven a Clock in the day
was found in <pb n="240" facs="tcp:104314:144"/>

down on his knees, and prayed those who surprised him, not to publish his
shame: But they had a mind to make some advantage by it, and asked him Money.
He gave them 30 <hi>lib.</hi> which he protested was all he had, but he
promised them 30 <hi>lib.</hi> more: yet failing in the payment, a Sute
followed on it: and in a Bill which I have seen given to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> then
Master of the Rolls, the case is related.</p>
            <p>But all stories of this Kings served only to disgrace those Abbots
or Monks that were so faulty.<note place="margin">The Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and cheats of
  these Houses disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</note> And the people generally said, these were
personal crimes which ought to be punished: but they were no way satisfied with
the Justice of the Kings proceedings, against whole Houses for the faults of a
few. Therefore another way was thought on, which indeed proved more effectual,
both for recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people out of the Superstitious fondness they had for
their Images and Relicks, and for discovering the secret Impostures that had
been long practised in these Houses. And this was, to order the Visitors to
examine well all the Relicks, and feigned Images, to which Pilgrimages were
wont to be made. In this, Doctor <hi>London</hi> did great service. From
<hi>Reading</hi> he writes, 
<q>That the chief Relicks of Idolatry in the Nation was there: an
  Angel with one wing, that brought over the Spears head that pierced our Saviors
  side. To which he adds a long Inventory of their other Relicks, and says there
  were as many more as would fill Four Sheets of Paper. He also writes from other
  places that he had every-where taken down their Images and Trinkets.</q> At St.
<hi>Edmundsbury,</hi> as <hi>Iohn ap Rice</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they found some of
the Coals that Roasted St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> the Parings of St.
<hi>Edmunds</hi> Toes, St. <hi>Thomas Becket's</hi> Penknife, and Boots; with
as many pieces of the Cross of our Savior, as would make a large whole Cross.
They had also Relicks against Rain, and for hindring weeds to spring. But to
pursue this further were endless, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks were so innumerable. And the
value which the people had of them may be gathered from this; that a piece of
St. <hi>Andrews</hi> finger set in an ounce of silver, was laid to pledge by
the House of <hi>Westacre</hi> for 40 <hi>lib.</hi> but the Visitors, when they
suppressed that House, did not think fit to redeem it at so high a rate.</p>
            <p>For their Images, some of them were brought to <hi>London,</hi>
and were there at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross in the sight of all the
people,<note place="margin">Images pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly broken.</note> broken; that they
might be fully convinced of the jugling Impostures of the Monks. And in
particular, the Crucifix of <hi>Boxley</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the Rood of Grace</hi>; to which many Pilgrimages had been made, because it
was observed sometimes to bow, and to lift it self up, to shake, and to stir
head, hands, and feet, to roul the eyes, move the lips, and bend the brows: All
which were looked on by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused multitude, as the effects of a Divine
Power. These were now publickly discovered to have been cheats: For the Springs
were shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by which all these motions were made. Upon which <hi>Iohn
Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> made a Sermon, and Broke the
Rood in pieces. There was also another famous Imposture discovered at
<hi>Hales</hi> in <hi>Glocestershire</hi>; where the Blood of Christ was shewed
in a viol of Christal, which the people sometimes saw but sometimes they could
not see it: So they were made believe, that they were <pb n="243" facs="tcp:104314:145"/>
not capable of so signal a favour,<note place="margin">1538.</note> as long as
they were in Mortal sin; and so they continued to make presents, till they
bribed Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to give them the sight of so Blessed a Relick.<note place="margin">

               </note> This was now discovered to have been the Blood
of a Duck, which they renewed every week: and the one side of the Viol, was so
thick that there was no seeing through it, but the other was clear and
transparent: And it was so placed near the Altar, that one in a secret place
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, could turn either side of it outward. So when they had drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the
Pilgrims that came thither, of all they had brought with them, then they
afforded them the favour of turning the clear side outward; who upon that went
home very well-satisfied with their journey and the expence they had been at.
There was brought out of <hi>Wales</hi> a huge Image of wood, called <hi>Darvel
Gatheren,</hi> of which one <hi>Ellis Price</hi> Visitor of the Diocess of St.
<hi>Asaph</hi> gave this account. On the 6th of <hi>April</hi> 1537. 
<q>That the people of the Countrey had a great Superstition for it,
  and many Pilgrimages were made to it: so that the day before he wrote, there
  were reckoned to be above five or six hundred Pilgrims there: Some brought Oxen
  and Cattel, and some brought Money; and it was generally believed, that if any
  offered to that Image, he had Power to deliver his Soul from Hell.</q> So it
was ordered to be brought to <hi>London,</hi> where it serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for fewel to
burn Friar <hi>Forrest.</hi> There was an huge Image of our Lady at
<hi>Worcester,</hi> that was had in great reverence; which when it was stript
of some veils that covered it, was found to be the Statue of a Bishop.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barlow</hi> Bishop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> did also give many
advertisements of the Superstition of his Countrey, and of the Clergy and Monks
of that Diocess, who were guilty of Heathenish Idolatry, gross Impiety, and
Ignorance, and of abusing the people with many evident forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: about which
he said, he had good evidence when it should be called for. But that which drew
most Pilgrims and presents in those parts, was an Image of our Lady with a
Taper in her hand; which was believed to have burnt nine years, till one
forswearing himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, it went out: and was then much Reverenced and
Worshipped. He found all about the Cathedral so full of Superstitious conceits,
that there was no hope of working on them; therefore he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the
Translating the Episcopal Seat from St. <hi>Davids</hi> to
<hi>Caermaerden</hi>; which he pressed by many Arguments, and in several

<hi>Walsingham,</hi> of <hi>Ipswich,</hi> and <hi>Islington,</hi> with a great
many more, were brought up to <hi>London,</hi> and burnt by <hi>Cromwels</hi>

the Martyr:</hi> who being raised up by King <hi>Henry</hi> the ad, to the
Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> did afterwards give that King much
trouble; by opposing his Authority, and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes. And though he once
consented to the Articles agreed on at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> for bearing down the
Papal, and securing the Regal Power; yet he soon after repented, of that only
piece of Loyalty, of which he was guilty all the while he was Arch-Bishop. He
fled to the Pope, who received him as a Confessor for the dearest Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Belief: The King and Kingdoms were Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:104314:146"/> and put under an Interdict upon his Account. But
afterwards, upon the Intercession of the <hi>French</hi> King, King
<hi>Henry</hi> and he were reconciled, and the Interdict was taken off. Yet his
unquiet Spirit could take no rest, for he was no sooner at <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
than he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Embroyl the Kingdom again: and was proceeding by Censures
against the Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and some other Bishops, for Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kings Son in his Absence. Upon the news of that, the King being then in
<hi>Normandy,</hi> said, <hi>If he had faithful Servants he would not be so
troubled with such a Priest</hi>; whereupon some zealous or offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Courtiers, came over and killed him: For which, as the King was made to
undergoe a severe pennance, so the Monks were not wanting in their ordinary
Arts to give out many miraculous stories concerning his Blood. This soon drew a
Canonization from <hi>Rome</hi>; and he being a Martyr for the Papacy, was more
extolled than all the Apostles or Primitive Saints had ever been. So that for
300 years, he was accounted one of the greatest Saints in Heaven, as may appear
from the accounts in the leger-Books, of the offerings made to the three
greatest Altars in Christs Church in <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The one was to
Christ, the other to the Virgin, and the third to St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi> In one
year there was offered at Christ's Altar, 3 <hi>lib.</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6
<hi>d.</hi> To the Virgins Altar, 63 <hi>lib.</hi> 5<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi>
But to St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Altar 832<hi>lib.</hi> 12<hi>s.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi>
But the next year the odds grew greater; for there was not a penny offered at
Christs Altar, and at the Virgins, only 4 <hi>lib.</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> 8
<hi>d.</hi> But at St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s 954 <hi>lib.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 3
<hi>d.</hi> By such offerings it came, that his Shrine was of inestimable
value. There was one Stone offered there by <hi>Lewis</hi> the 7th of
<hi>France,</hi> who came over to visit it, in a Pilgrimage, that was believed
the Richest in <hi>Europe.</hi> Nor did they think it enough to give him one
day in the Calendar the 29th of <hi>December</hi>; but unusual honours were
devised, for this Martyr of the liberties of the Church greater than any that
had been given to the Martyrs for Christianity. The day of raising his body, or
as they called it, of his Translation, being the 7th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> was not
only a holy-day, but every 50th year, there was a Jubilee for 15 days
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and Indulgence was granted, to all that came to visit his
shrine:<note place="margin">

after his Translation, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1420; which bears, that there were then
about an hundred thousand strangers come to visit his Tomb. The Jubilee began
at twelve a clock on the Vigil of the feast, and lasted 15 days, by such Arts
they drew an incredible deal of wealth to his shrine. The Riches of that,
together with his disloyal practices, made the King resolve both to un-shrine
and un-Saint him at once. And then his skull, which had been much worshipped,
was found an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture. For the true skull was lying with the rest of his
bones in his grave. The shrine was broken down, and carryed away; the Gold that
was about it, filling two Chests, which were so heavy that they were a load to
Eight strong men to carry them out of the Church. And his bones were as some
say burnt, so it was understood at <hi>Rome,</hi> but others say they were so
mixed with other dead bones, that it would have been a Miracle indeed to have
distinguished them afterwards. The King also ordered his name to be struck out
of the Kalendar, and the office for his Festivity to be dasht out of all
Breviaries. <pb n="245" facs="tcp:104314:146"/> And thus was the Superstition of
<hi>England</hi> to Images and Relicks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated.</p>
            <p>Yet the King took care to qualifie the distaste which the Articles
published the former year had given.<note place="margin">New Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles about
  Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</note> And though there was no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the year
1537. yet there was a Convocation; upon the Conclusion of which, there was
Printed an Explanation of the chief points of Religion, Signed by nineteen
Bishops, eight Arch-Deacons, and seventeen Doctors of Divinity and Law. In
which there was an Exposition of the Creed, the seven Sacraments, the ten
Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Lords Prayer, and the Salutation of the Virgin, with an
Account of Justification and Purgatory. But this work was put in a better Form
afterwards, where the Reader will find a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account of it. When
all these Proceedings of the Kings were known at <hi>Rome,</hi> all the
Satyrical Pens there were employed to paint him out, as the most Infamous
Sacrilegious Tyrant that ever was.<note place="margin">Invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the
  King Printed at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> They represented him as one that made War
with Heaven, and the Saints that were there: That committed outrages on the
bodies of the Saints, which the Heathenish Romans would have punished severely
for any that committed the like on those that were dead, how mean or bad soever
they had been. All his proceedings against the Priests or Monks that were
Attainted and Executed for high Treason, were represented as the effects of
savage and barbarous Cruelty. His suppressing the Monasteries, and devouring
what the Devotion of former Ages had Consecrated to God, and his Saints, was
called Ravenous and Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sacrilege; nor was there any thing omitted that
could make him appear to posterity, the blackest Tyrant that ever wore a Crown.
They compared him to <hi>Pharaoh, Nabuchadonosor, Belshazar, Nero,
Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi> and <hi>Dioclesian</hi>; but chiefly to <hi>Iulian</hi> the
Apostate. This last Paralel liked them best, and his Learning, his Apostacy,
and pretence of Reforming, were all thought copied from <hi>Iulian</hi>; only
they said his manners were worse. These things were every day Printed at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the Informations that were brought out of <hi>England</hi>
were generally addressed to Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> whose style was also known
in some of them: All which possest the King with the deepest and most
implacable hatred to him that ever he bore to any person, and did provoke him
to all these severities that followed on his Kindred and Family.</p>
            <p>But the malice of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> did not stop
there.<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.</note> For now the Pope
published all these Thunders which he had threatned three years before. The
Bull of Deposition is Printed in <hi>Cherubins Bulla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Romanum,</hi> which
since many have the confidence to deny mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact; the Most publickly
acted, shall be found in the Collection of Papers, the substance of it is as
follows. 
<q>The Pope being Gods Vicar on Earth; and according to
  <hi>Ieremy's</hi> Prophecy,<note place="margin">The Popes Bulls against the
 King.</note> set over Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdoms, <hi>to root out and destroy</hi>;
  and having <hi>the supream power over all the Kings in the whole World</hi>;
  was bound to proceed to due correction, when milder courses were ineffectual;
  therefore since King <hi>Henry,</hi> who had been formerly a <hi>Defender of
  the Faith,</hi> had fallen from it; had contrary to an Inhibition made, put
  away his Queen, and marryed one <hi>Anne Bollein,</hi> and had made impious and
  hurtful Laws; denying the Pope to be the Supream Head of <pb n="246" facs="tcp:104314:147"/>
  the Church, but assuming that Title to himself; and had required all his
  Subjects under pain of death to swear it; and had put the Cardinal of
  <hi>Rochester</hi> to death, because he would not consent to these Heresies;
  and by all these things had rendred himself unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Regal Dignity; and
  had hardened his heart (as <hi>Pharoah</hi> did) against all the Admonitions of
  Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since these his crimes were so
  notorious, he in imitation of what the Apostle did to <hi>Elimas</hi> the
  Magician, proceeds to such Censures as he had deserved; and with the advice of
  his Cardinals, does first exhort him and all his Complices, to return from
  their errours, to annull the Acts lately made; and to proceed no farther upon
  them: which he requires him and them to do, under the pains of Excommunication
  and Rebellion, and of the Kings losing his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; whom he required within 90
  dayes, to appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> by himself or Proxy, and his Complices
  within 60 dayes, to give an account of their Actions; otherwise he would then
  proceed to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sentence against them. And Declares, that if the King and
  his Complices do not appear, he has fallen from the right to his Crown, and
  they from the right to their Estates; and when they die, they were to be denied
  Christian Burial. He puts the whole Kingdom under an Interdict; and declares
  all the Kings Children by the said <hi>Anne,</hi> and the Children of all his
  Complices, to be under the same pains, though they be now under age; and
  Incapacitates them for all honours or employments; and declares all the
  Subjects or Vassals of the Kings or his Complices, absolved from all Oaths or
  Obligations to them, and requires them to acknowledg them no more. And declares
  him and them Infamous, so that they might nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be witnesses nor make Wills.
  He requires all other persons to have no dealings with him or them, neither by
  Trading, nor any other way, under the pain of Excommunication; the annulling
  their Contracts, and the exposing goods so Traded in, to all that should catch
  them. And that all Clergymen should within five dayes after the expiration of
  the time prefixed, go out of the Kingdom; (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only so many Priests as
  would be necessary for Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and giving the Sacrament to such as
  died in Penitence) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pains of Excommunication and Deprivation. And
  Charges all Noble-men and others in his Dominions, under the same pains, to
  rise up in Arms against him, and to drive him out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that
  none should take Arms for him, or any way assist him: and Declares all other
  Princes absolved from any Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies made, or to be made, with him; and
  earnestly obtests the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and all Kings, and requires other Princes under
  the former pains, to trade no more with him; and in case of their disobedience
  he puts their Kingdomes under an Interdict. And requires all Princes and
  Military persons, in the vertue of Holy Obedience, to make War upon him, and to
  force him to return to the Obedience of the Apostolick See; and to seize on all
  Goods, or Merchandizes belonging to the King or his Complices, where-ever they
  could find them; and that such of his Subjects that were seized on, should be
  made Slaves. And requires all Bishops, Three dayes after the time that was set
  down was elapsed, to intimate this Sentence in all <pb n="247" facs="tcp:104314:147"/> their
  Churches, with putting out of Candles, and other Ceremonies that ought to be
  used, in the most solemn and publick manner that might be. And all who hindered
  the Publication of this Sentence, are put under the same Pains. He ordained
  this Sentence to be affixed at <hi>Rome, Tournay,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk</hi>;
  which should stand for a sufficient publication; and concludes, that if any
  should endeavour to oppose, or enervate any of the premises, he should incur
  the indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Almighty God, and the Holy Apostles, St. <hi>Peter</hi>
  and <hi>Paul.</hi> Dated at <hi>Rome</hi> the 30th of <hi>August,</hi>
  1635.</q> But the Pope found the Princes of Christendom liked the precedent, of
using a King in that manner, so ill, that he suspended the Execution of this
Bull till this time, that the suppression of Abbies, and the burning of
<hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> Bones (for it was so represented at <hi>Rome,</hi>
though our writers say they were buried;) did so inflame the Pope, that he
could forbear no longer; and therefore by a new sentence he did all he could to
shake him in his Throne.</p>
            <p>The Preamble of it was, 
<q>That as our Saviour had pity on St. <hi>Peter</hi> after his
  fall, so it became St. <hi>Peters</hi> successors to imitate our Saviour in his
  Clemency; and that therefore though he having heard of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s
  crimes, had proceeded to a sentence against him; (Here the former Bull was
  recited.) Yet some other Princes who hoped he might be reclaimed by gentler
  methods, had interposed for a suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Sentence: and he being easie
  to believe, what he so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desired, had upon their Intercession
  suspended it. But now he found they had been deceived in their hopes, and that
  he grew worse and worse; and had done such dishonour to the Saints, as to raise
  St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterburies</hi> body, to arraign him of High
  Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and to burn his Body, and Sacrilegiously to rob the Riches that had
  been offered to his Shrine, as also to suppress St. <hi>Austins</hi> Abbey in
  <hi>Canterbury</hi>; and that having thrust out the Monks, he had put in wild
  Beasts into their grounds, having transformed himself into a Beast. Therefore
  he takes off the Suspension, and publishes the Bull, commanding it to be
  executed: Declaring that the affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at <hi>Diepe</hi> or
  <hi>Bulloign</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> or
  <hi>Callistren,</hi> (that is <hi>Callstream,</hi> a Town near the border of
  <hi>England,</hi>) in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Tuam,</hi> or <hi>Artifert</hi>
  in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any two of these, should be a sufficient Publication.
  Dated the 7th of <hi>December, Anno Dom.</hi> 1538.</q>
            </p>
            <p>No man can read these Bulls, but he must conclude that if the Pope
be the Infallible and Universal Pastor of the Church, whom all are bound to
obey, he has a full authority over all Kings, to proceed to the highest
Censures possible: and since the matters of fact, enumerated in the Sentence as
the grounds of it, were certainly true; then
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Pope is either cloathed
with the powers of Deposing Princes, or if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, he lied to the world
when he pretended to it thus, and taught false Doctrine, which cannot stand
with Infallibility: And the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded grounds of the sentence as to matter of
fact, being evidently true, this must be a just Sentence; and therefore all
that acknowledged the Infallibility of that See, were bound to obey it, and all
the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions that followed, during the reign of the King or his Children,
were founded on this sentence, and must be justified by it; otherwise the 
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104314:148"/> Popes Infallibility must fall to the ground. But this
was to be said for the Pope, that though he had raised the several branches of
this Sentence, higher than any of his Predecessors had ever done; yet as to the
main, he had very good and Authentick Precedents for what he did, from the
Depositions of Emperours or Kings, that were made by former Popes for about 500
years together. This I thought need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be more fully opened, because of the
present Circumstances we are now in; since hereby every one that will consider
things, must needs see that the belief of the Popes Infallibility does
neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily infer the acknowledgment of their power of deposing Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Kings. For it is plain, the Pope did this <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> and as a Pastor
Feeding and Correcting his Flock.</p>
            <p>But not content with this he also wrote to other Princes,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming them against the King; Particularly to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi>
and <hi>Scotland.</hi> To the last of these he sent a <hi>Breve</hi>; declaring
King <hi>Henry</hi> a Heretique, a Schismatique, a manifest Adulterer, a
publick Murtherer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lesley, Hist. Scot.</hi>
               </note> a
Rebel, and convict of High Treason against him, the Pope his Lord; for which
Crimes he had deposed him, and offered his Dominions to him, if he would go and
invade them. And thus the breach between him and the Pope was past reconciling:
and at <hi>Rome</hi> it was declared equally meritorious to fight against him,
as against the <hi>Turk.</hi> But <hi>Card. Pool</hi> made it more meritorious
in his Book. Yet the Thunders of the <hi>Vatican</hi> had now lost their force;
so that these had no other effect but to enrage the King more against all such
as were suspected to favour their interests, or to hold any correspondence with
Cardinal <hi>Pool.</hi> Therefore he first procured a Declaration against the
Popes pretensions, to be Signed by all the Bishops of <hi>England</hi>: In
which, after they declared against the Popes Ecclesiastical Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,<note place="margin">The Clergy in <hi>England</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared against these.</note>
upon the grounds formerly touched, they concluded, 
<q>That the People ought to be Instructed, that Christ did expresly
  forbid his Apostles or their Successors to take to themselves the power of the
  Sword, or the authority of Kings. And that, if the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or
  any other Bishop assumed any such power, he was a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Usurper of other
  mens Rights, and a subverter of the Kingdom of Christ.</q> This was subscribed
by 19 Bishops, (all that were then in <hi>England,</hi>) and 25 Doctors of
Divinity and Law. It was at some time before <hi>May</hi> 1538. For <hi>Edward
Fox</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> who was one that signed it died the 8th.
of <hi>May</hi> that year. There was no Convocation called by Writ for doing
this. For as there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any such Writ in the Registers, so if it
had been done by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, <hi>Cromwell</hi> had signed it first; but his
hand not being at it, it is more probable that a meeting of the Clergy was
called by the Kings Missive Letters; or that, as was once done before, the
Paper was drawn at <hi>London,</hi> and sent over the Kingdom to the Episcopal
Sees, for the Bishops hands to it.</p>
            <p>There is another original Paper extant, Signed at this time by
eight Bishops: from which I conjecture those were all that were then about
<hi>London.</hi> It was to shew, 
<q>That by the Commission which Christ gave to Church-men,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.</note> they were only Ministers of his
  Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to instruct the people in the purity of the Faith: But that by other
  places of Scripture, the Authority of Christian Princes over 
  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:104314:148"/> all their Subjects, as well Bishops and Priests, as
  others, was also clear. And that the Bishops and Priests have charge of Souls
  with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Cures, Power to administer Sacraments, and to teach the word of
  God: To the which word of God, Christian Princes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg themselves
  subject; and that in case the Bishops be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, it is the Christian
  Princes Office to see them do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</q> This, being Signed by <hi>Iohn
Hilsey</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> must be after the year 1537. in which
he was consecrated; and <hi>Latimer</hi> and <hi>Shaxton</hi> also Signing, it
must be before the year 1539. in which they resigned. But I believe it was
Signed at the same time that the other was: And the design of it was to refuse
those Calumnies spread at <hi>Rome,</hi> as if the King had wholly Suppressed
all Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Offices, and denyed them any divine Authority, making them
wholly dependent on the Civil Power, and Acting by Commission only from him.
And therefore they explained the limits of both these Powers, in so clear and
moderate a way, that it must have stopt the Mouths of all Opposers. But whether
there was any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick use made of this Paper, I can by no means discover.</p>
            <p>The King did also set forward the Printing of the <hi>English</hi>
Bible, which was finished this year, at <hi>London,</hi> by <hi>Grafton</hi>
the Printer, who Printed 1500 of them at his own Charge.<note place="margin">The
  Bible Printed in <hi>English.</hi>
               </note> This Bible <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
presented to the King, and procured his Warrant, allowing all his Subjects in
all his Dominions to read it, without controul or hazard. For which, the
Arch-Bishop wrote <hi>Cromwel</hi> a Letter of most hearty thanks, dated the
13th of <hi>August.</hi> 
               <q> Who did now rejoyce that he saw this day of Reformation, which
  he concluded was now risen in <hi>England,</hi> since the Light of Gods word
  did shine over it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Cloud.</q> The Translation had been sent over to
<hi>France</hi> to be Printed at <hi>Paris</hi>: the workmen in
<hi>England</hi> not being judged able to do it, as it ought to be. Therefore
in the year 1537. it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to <hi>Bonners</hi> care, who was then
Ambassador at <hi>Paris,</hi> and was much in <hi>Cromwels</hi> favour, who was
setting him up against <hi>Gardiner.</hi> He procured the King of
<hi>France</hi>'s leave to Print it at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> in a large Volume: but
upon a complaint made by the <hi>French</hi> Clergy, the Press was stopt, and
most of the Copies were seized on and publickly burnt: but some Copies were
conveyed out of the way, and the work-men and fourms were brought over to
<hi>England</hi>:<note place="margin">New injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions set out by the
  King.</note> where it was now finished and published. And Injunctions were
giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out in the Kings name, by <hi>Cromwel</hi> to all Incumbents, 
<q>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide one of these Bibles, and set it up publickly in the
  Church,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.</note> and not to hinder
  or discourage the reading of it, but to encourage all persons to peruse it, as
  being the true lively word of God, which every Christian ought to believe,
  embrace, and follow, if he expected to be saved. And all were exhorted, not to
  make contests about the Exposition or sense of any difficult place, but to
  refer that to men of higher judgment in the Scriptures. Then some other Rules
  were added, about the Instructing the people in the Principles of Religion, by
  teaching the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments in
  <hi>English</hi>: And that in every Church there should be a Sermon, made every
  quarter of an year, at least, to declare to the people the true Gospel of
  Christ, and to exhort them to the <pb n="250" facs="tcp:104314:149"/> works of Charity,
  Mercy, and Faith: and not to trust in other mens works, or Pilgrimages, to
  Images, or Relicks, or saying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Beads, which they did not understand; since
  these things tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Idolatry and Superstition, which of all offences did
  most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Gods Indignation. They were to take down all Images, which were
  abused by Pilgrimages, or offerings made to them; and to suffer no Candles to
  be set before any Image; only there might be Candles before the Cross, and
  before the Sacrament, and about the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre: And they were to Instruct the
  people, that Images serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only as the Books of the un-learned, to be
  remembrances of the Conversations of them whom they represented: but if they
  made any other use of Images, it was Idolatry: for remedying whereof, as the
  King had already done in part, so he intended to do more for the abolishing
  such Images, which might be a great offence to God, and a danger to the Souls
  of his Subjects. And if any of them had formerly Magnified such Images, or
  Pilgrimages, to such purposes; They were ordered openly to recant, and
  acknowledg, that in saying such things they had been led by no ground in
  Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but where deceived by a vulgar error, which had crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
  Church, through the Avarice of those who had profit by it. They were also to
  discover all such as were Letters of the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods word in
  <hi>English,</hi> or hindred the Execution of these Injunctions. Then followed
  orders for keeping of Registers in their Parishes, for Reading all the Kings
  Injunctions once every quarter at least: That none were to alter any of the
  Holy-days without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections from the King: And all the Eves of the Holy-days
  for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly abrogated, were declared to be no Fasting-days: The Commemoration of
  <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> was to be clean omitted: The kneeling for the Avies
  after Sermon were also forbidden; which were said in hope to obtain the Popes
  Pardon. And whereas in their Processions they used to say so many Suffrages
  with an <hi>Ora pro nobis</hi> to the Saints, by which they had not time to say
  the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages to God himself, they were to teach the people, that it were
  better to omit the <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> and to sing the other Suffrages
  which were most necessary and most effectual.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These Injunctions struck at three main Points of Popery:
contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encouragements to the vulgar, to Read the Scriptures in a known
tongue, and putting down all worship of Images, and leaving it free for any
Curate to leave out the Suffrages to the Saints. So that they were looked on as
a deadly blow to that Religion. But now those of that party did so Artificially
comply with the King, that no advantages could be found against any of them for
their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The King was Master at home, and no more to be diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.
He had not only broken the Rebellion of his own Subjects, and secured himself
by Alliance from the dangers threatned him by the Pope; but all their
expectations from the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> were now clouded: For on the 12th of
<hi>October</hi> 1537. Queen <hi>Iane</hi> had born him a Son; who was
Christned <hi>Edward</hi>; the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of
his God-Fathers.<note place="margin">Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> born.</note> This
very much encouraged all that were for Reformation, and disheartned those who
were against it. But the joy for this young Prince was qualified by the Queens
death, <pb n="251" facs="tcp:104314:149"/> two days after; which afflicted the King very
much: for of all his Wives, she was the dearest to him. And his grief for that
loss is given as the reason, why he continued two years a Widower. But others
thought he had not so much tenderness in his Nature, as to be much or long
troubled for any thing. Therefore the slowness of his Marrying was ascribed to
some reasons of State. But the Birth of the Prince was a great disappointment
to all those whose hopes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted on the Lady <hi>Maries</hi> succeeding her
Father: Therefore they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselves with more than ordinary Compliance
to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gardiner</hi> was as busie as any in declaiming against the
Religious Houses,<note place="margin">Great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances by the Popish
  party.</note> and took occasion in many of his Sermons to commend the King for
suppressing them: The Arch-Bishop of <hi>York</hi> had recovered himself at
Court: And I do not find that he interposed in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of any of the
Religious Houses, except <hi>Hexham,</hi> about which he wrote to
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> that it was a great Sanctuary when the <hi>Scots</hi> made
Inroads: And so he thought that the continuing of it might be of great use to
the King. He added in that Letter, 
<q>that he did carefully silence all the Preachers of Novelties.
  But some of these boasted, that they would shortly have Licences from the King,
  as he heard they had already from the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; but
  he desired <hi>Cromwel</hi> to prevent that mischief.</q> This is all that I
find of him.</p>
            <p>There is a Pardon granted to <hi>Stokesly</hi> Bishop of
<hi>London,</hi> on the 3d of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the 30th year of his Reign
being this year, for having Acted by Commission from <hi>Rome,</hi> and sued
out Bulls from thence. If these crimes were done before the Separation from
<hi>Rome,</hi> they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the General Pardon. If he took a
particular Pardon, it seems strange that it was not enrolled till now. But I am
apt to believe it was rather the Omission of a Clerk, than his being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of
such a Transgression about this time; for I see no cause to think the King
would have Pardoned such a Crime in a Bishop in those days. All that Party had
now by their complyance and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission gained so much on the King, that he
began to turn more to their Councils, than he had done of late years.
<hi>Gardiner</hi> was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>France,</hi> where he had been
Ambassador for some years: He had been also in the Emperors Court, and there
were violent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions that he had secretly reconciled himself to the Pope,
and entred into a Correspondence with him. For one of the Legates Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
discoursed of it at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> to one of Sir <hi>Henry Knevets</hi>
reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue (who was joyned in the Embassy with <hi>Gardiner,</hi>) whom he took
to be <hi>Gardiners</hi> Servant, and with whom he had an old acquaintance. The
matter was traced, and <hi>Knevet</hi> spoke with the <hi>Italian</hi> that had
first let it fall, and was perswaded of the truth of the thing: But
<hi>Gardiner</hi> smelling it out, said, That <hi>Italian</hi> upon whose
Testimony the whole matter depended, was corrupted to ruine him; and
complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it to the Emperors Chancellor <hi>Granvel</hi>: Upon which
<hi>Ludovico</hi> (that was the <hi>Italian</hi> name) was put in Prison. And
it seems the King either looked on it as a Contrivance of <hi>Gardiners</hi>
enemies, or at least seemed to do so, for he continued still to employ him. Yet
on many occasions he expressed great contempt of him, and used him 
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104314:150"/> not as a Councellor, but as a slave. But he was a man of
great cunning, and had observed the Kings temper exactly, and knew well to take
a fit occasion for moving the King in any thing, and could improve it
dextrously. He therefore represented to the King, that nothing would so secure
him both at home, and abroad, against all the mischief the Pope was
contriving,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gardiner</hi> stirs up the King against those
  called <hi>Sacramenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
               </note> as to shew great zeal against
Hereticks, chiefly the <hi>Sacramentaries,</hi> (by that name they branded all
that denied the Corporal presence of Christ in the Eucharist.) And the King
being all his life, zealous for the belief of the Corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was
the more easily perswaded to be severe on that Head: And the rather because the
Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> whose friendship was necessary to him, being all
<hi>Lutherans,</hi> his proceedings against the <hi>Sacramentaries</hi> would
give them no offence.</p>
            <p>An occasion at that time presented it self as opportunely as they
could have wished, one <hi>Iohn Nicolson,</hi> alias <hi>Lambert,</hi> was then
que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for that opinion.<note place="margin">And <hi>Lamb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt</hi>
  in particular.</note> He had been Minister of the <hi>English</hi> Company at
<hi>Antwerp</hi>; where being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Tindal</hi> and
<hi>Frith,</hi> he improved that knowledg of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which was first infused
in him by <hi>Bilney</hi>: But Chancellor <hi>More</hi> ordered the Merchants
to dismiss him; so he came over to <hi>England,</hi> and was taken by some of
Arch-Bishop <hi>Warhams</hi> officers, and many Articles were objected to him.
But <hi>Warham</hi> died soon after, and the change of Counsels that followed
occasioned his Liberty. So he kept a School at <hi>London,</hi> and hearing
Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi> afterwards Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Preach of the
presence of Christ in the Sacrament, he came to him upon it, and offered his
reasons why he could not believe the Doctrine he had Preached: Which he put in
Writing, digesting them into ten Arguments. <hi>Taylor</hi> shewed this to
Doctor <hi>Barnes,</hi> who as he was bred among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> so had
not only brought over their opinions, but their temper with him: He thought
that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would more obstruct the progress of the Reformation than the
venting that Doctrine in <hi>England.</hi> Therefore <hi>Taylor</hi> and he
carryed the Paper to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who was at that time also of
<hi>Luthers</hi> opinion, which he had drunk in from his friend <hi>Osiander.
Latimer</hi> was of the same belief. So <hi>Lambert</hi> was brought before
them, and they studyed to make him retract his Paper: But all was in vain, for
<hi>Lambert</hi> by a fatal resolution appealed to the King.<note place="margin">Who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the King.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Gardiner</hi> laid hold on, and perswaded the King to
proceed so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and severely in it. The King was soon prevailed with, and
both Interest and Vanity concurred to make him improve this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for
shewing his zeal and Learning. So Letters were written to many of the Nobility
and Bishops, to come and see this Tryal; in which the King intended to sit in
Person, and to manage some part of the Argument. In <hi>November,</hi> on the
day that was prefixed, there was a great appearance in
<hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> of the Bishops, and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the Nobility, Judges,
and the Kings Council; with an incredible number of Spectators. The Kings
Guards were all in White, and so was the Cloth of State.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly tryed at
  <hi>Westminster.</hi>
               </note>When the Prisoner was brought to the Barr. The
Tryal was opened by a Speech of Doctor <hi>Dayes,</hi> which was to this
effect: 
<q>That this Assembly was not at all convened to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute 
  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:104314:150"/> about any Point of Faith; but that the King being
  Supream Head, intended openly to condemn and confute that mans Heresie in all
  their presence.</q> Then the King commanded him to declare his opinion about
the Sacrament. To which <hi>Lambert</hi> began his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer with a Preface,
acknowledging the Kings great goodness, that he would thus hear the Causes of
his Subjects, and commending his great Judgment and Learning. In this the King
interrupted him, telling him in Latine, that he came not there to hear his own
praises set forth, and therefore commanded him to speak to the matter. This he
uttered with a stern Countenance; At which <hi>Lambert</hi> being a little
disordered, the King asked him again, whether was Christ's body in the
Sacrament or not? He answered in the Words of St. <hi>Austine, It was his Body
in a certain manner.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arguments brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
  him.</note> But the King bade him answer plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether it was Christs Body
or not? So he answered, <hi>That it was not his Body.</hi> Upon which the King
urged him with the words of Scripture, <hi>This is my Body</hi>; and then he
commanded the Arch-Bishop to confute his Opinion, who spoke only to that part
of it, which was grounded on the Impossibility of a Bodies being in two places
at once. And that he confuted from Christs appearing to St. <hi>Paul</hi>;
shewing that though he is alwayes in Heaven, yet he was seen by St.
<hi>Paul</hi> in the Air. But <hi>Lambert</hi> affirmed, that he was then only
in Heaven; and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> heard a Voice, and saw a Vision, but not
the very body of Christ. Upon this they disputed for some time: in which it
seems the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> thought <hi>Cranmer</hi> argued but
faintly, for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed in the Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tonstals</hi> arguments run all upon Gods Omnipotency, that it
was not to be limited by any appearances of difficulties, which flowed from our
want of a right understanding of things; and our Faculties being weak, our
notions of Impossibilities were proportioned to these. But <hi>Stokesley</hi>
thought he had found out a Demonstration that might put an end to the whole
Controversie; for he shewed, that in Nature we see one substance changed into
another, and yet the accidents remain. So when Water is boyled, till it
evaporates into Air, one substance is changed into another, and moysture that
was the accident remains, it being still moist. This (as one of the
eye-witnesses relates) was received with great applause, and much joy appeared
in the Bishops looks upon it. But whether the Spectators could distinguish well
between Laughter for Joy, and a scornful smile, I cannot tell: For certainly
this Crotchet must have provoked the latter rather; since it was a Sophisme,
not to be forgiven any above a Junior Sophister; thus from an accidental
conversion, where the substance was still the same, only altered in its Form
and Qualities, (according to the Language of that Philosophy, which was then
most in vogue,) to infer a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial mutation, where one substance was
annihilated, and a new one produced in its place. But these arguments it seems
disorder'd <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> somewhat; and either the Kings stern looks, the
variety of the Disputants, ten, one after another, engaging with him, or the
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the presence, with the length of the action, which continued five
hours, put him in some confusion; it is not improbable but they might in the
end bring him to be quite silent. This one that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent said, flowed from
his being spent and wearied; and that he saw <pb n="254" facs="tcp:104314:151"/> what he
said was little considered: but others ascribed it to his being confounded with
the arguments that were brought against him. So the general applause of the
Hall, gave the victory on the Kings side. When he was thus silent, the King
asked him if he was convinced by these arguments, and whether he would live or
die? He answered, <hi>That he committed his Soul to God, and submitted his Body
to the Kings Clemency.</hi> But the King told him, if he did not recant he must
die, for he would not be a Patron of Hereticks; and since he would not do that,
the King ordered <hi>Cromwel</hi> to read the Sentence, (which he as "the Kings
Vice-gerent did,<note place="margin">He is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note>) declaring him an
Incorrigible Heretick, and condemning him to be burnt. Which was soon after
executed in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> in a most barbarous manner; for when his Legs
and Thighs were burnt to the Stumps, there not being fire enough to consume the
rest of him suddenly, two of the Officers raised up his body on their Halberds,
he being yet alive, and crying out, <hi>None but Christ, none but Christ</hi>;
and then they let him fall down into the Fire, where he was quickly consumed to
ashes.<note place="margin">And Burned.</note> He was a learned and good man. His
answers to the Articles objected to him by <hi>Warham,</hi> and a Book which in
his Imprisonment he wrote for justifying his opinion, which he directed to the
King; do shew both great Learning for those times, and a very good
Judgment.</p>
            <p>This being done, the party that opposed the Reformation,
perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the King that he had got so much reputation to himself by it, that
it would effectually refute all aspersions, which had been cast on him, as if
he intended to change the Faith: neither did they forget to set on him in his
weak side, and magnifie all that he had said, as if the Oracle had uttered it:
By which they said it appeared he was indeed a Defender of the Faith, and the
Supream Head of the Church. And he had so good a conceit of what was then done,
that he intended to pursue these severities further; and therefore soon after
he resolved on Summoning a Parliament, partly for confirming what he had done,
and compleating what remained to be done fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the suppression of the
Monasteries; and likewise for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a new Law for punishing some Opinions,
which were then sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about the Sacrament, and some other Articles, as
will soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>Now the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Interest at Court,
suffered a great diminution.<note place="margin">The Popish party gain ground at
  Court.</note> His chief friend among the Bishops, was <hi>Fox</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of
<hi>Hereford,</hi> who was much esteemed, and imployed by the King. He was a
Privy-Councellor, and had been imployed in a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation with the Princes of
<hi>Germany,</hi> to whom he was a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Minister. They proposed,
That the King would receive the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confession, except in such
things as should be altered in it by common Consent, and defend it in a free
Council, if any such were called; and that neither of them should acknowledg
any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil called by the Pope: That the King should be called the Patron of
their League, and they should mutually assist one another, the King giving
100000 Crowns a year towards the defence of the League.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> being then in <hi>France,</hi>
did much disswade the King from making a Religious League with them; against
which <pb n="255" facs="tcp:104314:151"/> he gave some plausible politick reasons, for his
Conscience never strugled with a maxim of State. But the King liked most of the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;<note place="margin">The Kings correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the
  <hi>German</hi> Princes.</note> only he would not accept the Title of Defender
of their League, till some differences in the Doctrine were agreed. So they
were to have sent over <hi>Sturmius</hi> as their Agent; and <hi>Melancthon,
Bucer,</hi> and <hi>George Draco,</hi> to confer with the Kings Divines. But
upon Queen <hi>Anne's</hi> fall this vanished; and though the King entered into
a Civil League with them, and had frequently a mind to bring over
<hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon,</hi> for whom he had a great value, yet it never took effect.
There were three things in which the <hi>Germans</hi> were more positive than
in any other point of Reformation. These were, the Communion in both kinds, the
worship in a known Tongue, and an allowance for the marriage of the Clergy. All
the people had got these things in their heads; so that it was generally
believed, that if the Pope had in time consented to them, the Progress of the
Reformation had been much stopped. The express words of the Institution, and
the Novelty of the contrary practice, had engaged that Nation very early for
Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in both kinds. Common sense made them all desire to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what
they did and said in the Worship of God; and the lewd and dissolute practices
of the unmarried Clergy, were so publick, that they thought the honour of their
Families, of which that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is extremely sensible, could not be secured,
unless the Clergy might have Wives of their own. But at these the King stuck
more, than at other things that were more disputable. For in all other points
that were material, he had set up the Doctrine of the <hi>Ausburg</hi>
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; and there was good ground to hope that the Evidence of at least
two of these would have brought over the King to a fuller Agreement, and firmer
Union with them. But the Bishop of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's</hi> death gave a great blow
to that design. For though that party thought they had his room well
filled,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonners</hi> dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</note> when they had
got <hi>Bonner</hi> to be his Successor; yet they found afterwards what a fatal
mistake they committed, in raising him now to <hi>Hereford,</hi> and
translating him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few months to <hi>London,</hi> vacant by
<hi>Stokesleys</hi> death. But during the vacancy of the See of <hi>Hereford,
Cranmer</hi> held a Visitation in it, where he left some Injunctions (to be
found in the Collection) which chiefly related to the encouraging of reading
the Scriptures,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coll. Numb.</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>2.</note> and giving all due
obedience to the Kings Injunctions. For the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that adhered to
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> they were rather clogs than helps to him. <hi>Latimers</hi>
simplicity and weakness made him be despised: <hi>Shax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> proud and
litigious humour drew hatred on him: <hi>Barlow</hi> was not very discreet; and
many of the Preachers whom they cherished, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of an unbridled
forwardness of temper, or a true zeal that would not be managed and governed by
politick and prudent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, were flying at many things that were not yet
abolished. Many complaints were brought of these to the King. Upon which,
letters were sent to all the Bishops in the Kings name, to take care that as
the People should be instructed in the truth, so they should not be unwarily
charged with too many novelties; since the publishing these, if it was not
tempered with great discretion, would raise much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and other
inconveniencies that might be of dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But it seems this
Caveat did not produce what was designed <pb n="256" facs="tcp:104314:152"/> by it, or at
least the opposite party were still bringing in new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: for I have
seen an original Letter of <hi>Cromwels</hi> to the Bishop of
<hi>Landaffe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coll. Numb.</hi> 13.</note> bearing
date the 6th of <hi>Ianuary</hi>: In which he makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings
Letters sent to that purpose, and requires him to look to the Execution of
them, both against the violence of the new Preachers, and against those that
secretly carried on the pretended authority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>;
otherwise he threatens to proceed against him in an other manner. All these
things concurred to lessen <hi>Cranmers</hi> interest in the Court; nor had he
any firm friend there but <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who was also careful to preserve
himself: There was not a Queen now in the Kings bosome to favour their motions.
Queen <hi>Iane</hi> had been their friend, though she came in <hi>Anne
Bolleyns</hi> room that had supported them most. The King was observed to be
much guided by his Wives, as long as they kept their interest with him.
Therefore <hi>Cromwel</hi> thought the only way to retrieve a design that was
almost lost, was to engage the King in an Alliance with some of the Princes of
<hi>Germany</hi>; from whence he had heard much of the Beauty of the Lady
<hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cleve</hi>'s Sister, whose
elder sister was married to the Duke of <hi>Saxony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A new Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</note>But while he was
setting this on foot, a Parliament was summoned to meet the 28th of

Cirencester, Teukesbury, Colchester</hi> and <hi>Tavestoke,</hi> sate in it. On
the 5th of <hi>May,</hi> the Lord Chancellour acquainted them, that the King
being most desirous to have all his Subjects of one mind in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and to
quiet all Controversies about it, had commanded him to move to them, that a
Committee might be appointed for examining these different opinions, and
drawing up Articles for an agreement, which might be reported and considered by
the House. To this the Lords agreed, and named for a Committee,
<hi>Cromwel</hi> the Vice-gerent, the two Arch-Bishops, the Bishops of
<hi>Duresme, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells, Ely, Bangor, Carlisle</hi> and
<hi>Worcester</hi>: Who were ordered to go about it with all haste, and were
dispenced with for their attendance in the House, till they had ended their
business. But they could come to no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the Arch-bishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> having the Bishops of <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Worcester</hi>
to second him, and being favoured by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther five could
carry nothing against them: Nor would either party yeeld to the other, so that
11 dayes passed in these debates.</p>
            <p>On the 16th of <hi>May,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> told the
Lords, That the Committee that was named had made no progress,<note place="margin">The 6 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</note> for they were not of one
mind; which some of the Lords had objected, when they were first named.
Therefore he offered some Articles to the Lords consideration, that they might
be examined by the whole House, and that there might be a perpetual Law made
for the observation of them, after the Lords had freely delivered their minds
about them. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were.</p>
            <q> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>First,</hi> Whether in the Eucharist, Christs real Body was
present without any Transubstantiation? (so it is in the Journal <hi>absque
Transubstantiatione</hi>) it seems so the Corporal Presence had been 
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:104314:152"/> established, they would have left the manner of it
indefinite.<note place="margin">1539.</note>
               </p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether that Sacrament was to be given to the
Laity in both kinds?</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether the Vows of Chastity, made either by
Men or Women, ought to be observed, by the Law of God?</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whether by the Law of God private Masses ought
to be celebrated?</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Whether Priests by the Law of God might
marry?</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Whether Auricular Confession were necessary by
the Law of God?</p>
            </q>
            <p>Against these the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> argued long.
For the first, he was then in his opinion a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> so he was not
like to say much against it. But certainly he opposed the second much; since
there was not any thing for which those with whom he held corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence were
more earnest, and seemed to have greater advantages,<note place="margin">Reasons
  a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</note> both from Christs own words in the Institution, and the
constant practice of the Church for 12 ages.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Third,</hi> It seemed very hard to suppress so many
Monasteries, and set the Religious persons at liberty, and yet bind them up to
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity. That same Parliament by another Act, absolved them from their vow of
Poverty, giving them Power to purchase Lands: now it was not reasonable to bind
them up to some parts of their Vow, when they absolved them from the rest. And
it was no ways pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to bind them up from Marriage, since, as long as they
continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that State, they were still capable to re-enter into their
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, when a fair occasion should offer; whereas they, upon their
Marrying, did effectually lay down all possible pretentions to their former
Houses.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Fourth,</hi> The Asserting the Necessity of private
Masses, was a plain Condemnation of the Kings proceedings in the Suppression of
so many Religious Houses, which were Societies chiefly dedicated to that
purpose. For if these Masses did profit the Souls departed, the destroying so
many Foundations could not be justified. And for the living, these private
Masses were clearly contrary to the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, by which that which was
blessed and consecrated was to be distributed: And it was to be a Communion,
and so held by the Primitive Church, which admitted none, so much as to see the
Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of that Sacrament, but those who received it: Laying Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
upon such as were present at the rest of that office, and did not stay and
Communicate.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Fifth,</hi> it touched <hi>Cranmer</hi> to the quick,
for he was then Marryed. The Scripture did in no place enjoyn the Celibate of
the Clergy. On the contrary Scripture speaks of their Wives; and gives the
Rules of their living with them. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in express words
condemns all mens leaving their Wives, without exception, saying <hi>That the
man hath not Power over his own body but the Wife.</hi> In the Primitive
Church, though those that were in orders did not Marry, yet such as were
Marryed before Orders kept their Wives, of which there were many Instances; and
when some moved in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that all that had been
Marryed, when they entred into Orders, should put away their Wives, it was
rejected, and ever since the <pb n="258" facs="tcp:104314:153"/> 
               <hi>Greek</hi> Churches
have allowed their Priests to keep their Wives. Nor was it ever commanded in
the Western Church, till the Popes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their Usurpation. Therefore the
prohibition of it being only grounded on the Papal Constitutions, it was not
reasonable to keep it up, since that Authority on which it was built was now
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</p>
            <p>What was said concerning Auricular Confession, I cannot so easily
recover. For though <hi>Cranmer</hi> argued three days against these Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
I can only gather the substance of his Arguments from what himself wrote on
some of these Heads afterwards. For nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of what passed there, but
what is conveyed to us in the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which is short and defective.</p>
            <p>On the 24th of <hi>May</hi> the Parliament was Prorogued to the
30th, upon what reason it does not appear. It was not to set any of the Bills
backward; for it was agreed, that the Bills should continue in the State in
which they were then, till their next meeting. When they met again; on the 30th
of <hi>May</hi> being <hi>Friday,</hi> the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor intimated to them,
that not only the Spiritual Lords, but the King himself, had taken much pains
to bring things to an agreement which was effected. Therefore he moved in the
Kings name, that a Bill might be brought in for punishing such as offended
against these Articles. So the Lords appointed the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Ely,</hi> and St. <hi>Davids,</hi> and
Doctor <hi>Petre,</hi> a master of Chancery, (afterwards Secretary of State,)
to draw one Bill; and the Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> the Bishop of
<hi>Duresin,</hi> and <hi>Winchester,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Tregonnel,</hi>
another Master of Chancery, to draw another Bill about it; and to have them
both ready, and to offer them to the King by Sunday next. But the Bill that was
drawn by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and those with him, was best liked:
yet it seems the Matter was long contested, for it was not brought to the House
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 7th of <hi>Iune</hi>; and then the Lord Chancellor offered it, and
it was read the first time. On the 9th of <hi>Iune</hi> it had the second
reading, and on the 10th it was engrossed and read the third time. But when it
passed, the King desired the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to go out of
the House, since he could not give his consent to it; but he humbly excused
himself, for he thought he was bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to stay and vote against
it. It was sent down to the House of Commons, where it met with no great
opposition; for on the 14th it was agreed to, and sent up again: And on the
28th it had the force of a Law by the Royal Assent.</p>
            <p>The Title of it was, an Act <hi>for abolishing Diversity of
opinions in certain Articles concerning Christian Religion.</hi> It is said in
the Preamble, 
<q>that the King,<note place="margin">An Act past for them.</note>
  considering the blessed effects of union, and the mischiefs of discord, since
  there were many different opinions, both among the Clergy and Laity, about some
  points of Religion, had called this Parliament, and a Synod at the same time,
  for removing these differences, where six Articles were proposed, and long
  debated by the Clergy: And the King himself had come in person to the
  Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and Council, and opened many things of high Learning and great
  knowledg about them: And that he, with the Assent of both Houses of Parliament,
  had agreed on the following Articles. <pb n="259" facs="tcp:104314:153"/> 
                  <hi>First,</hi>
  That in the Sacrament of the Altar after the Consecration there remained no
  Substance of Bread and Wine, but under these forms, the Natural Body and Blood
  of Christ were present. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Communion in both kinds was not
  necessary to Salvation to all persons by the Law of God; but that both the
  Flesh and Blood of Christ were together in each of the kinds. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
  That Priests after the order of Priesthood might not Marry by the Law of God.
  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That vows of Chastity ought to be observed by the Law of
  God. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That the use of private Masses ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued;
  which as it was agreeable to Gods Law, so men received great benefit by them.
  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That Auricular Confession was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, and necessary, and
  ought to be retained in the Church. The Parliament thanked the King, for the
  pains he had taken in these Articles: And Enacted, that if any after the 12th
  of <hi>Iuly,</hi> did speak, preach, or write against the first Article, they
  were to be judged Hereticks, and to be burnt without any abjuration; and to
  forfeit their real and personal Estates to the King. And those who preached or
  obstinately disputed against the other Articles, were to be judged Felons; and
  to suffer death as Felons, without benefit of Clergy. And those, who either in
  word or writing, spake against them, were to be Prisoners during the Kings
  pleasure, and forfeit their goods and Chattels to the King, for the first time:
  And if they offended so the second time, they were to suffer as Felons. All the
  Marriages of Priests are declared void; and if any Priest did still keep any
  such woman, whom he had so Marryed, and lived familiarly with her, as with his
  Wife, he was to be judged a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon: And if a Priest lived carnally with any
  other woman, he was upon the first Conviction to forfeit his Benefices, Goods,
  and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and to be Imprisoned during the Kings pleasure; and upon the
  second Conviction, was to suffer as a Felon. The women so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, were also
  to be punished in the same manner, as the Priests; and those who contemned, or
  abstained from Confession, or the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, at the accustomed times, for the
  first offence were to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their Goods and Chattels, and be Imprisoned; and
  for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, were to be adjudged of Felony. And for the Execution of this
  Act, Commissions were to be issued out to all Arch-Bishops and Bishops, and
  their Chancellors and Commissaries, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the several shires as
  the King should name, to hold their Sessions quarterly, or oftner; and they
  were to proceed upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments, and by a Jury. Those Commissioners were to
  swear, that they should execute their Commission indifferently, without favour,
  affection, corruption, or malice. As Ecclesiastical Incumbents were to read
  this Act in their Churches once a quarter. And in the end a Proviso was added,
  concerning vows of Chastity. That they should not oblige any, except such as
  had taken them at or above the Age of 21 years; or had not been compelled to
  take them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Act was received, by all that secretly favoured Popery,<note place="margin">which is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.</note> with great joy; for now they
hoped to be revenged on all those who had hitherto set forward a Reformation.
It very much quieted the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots; who were now perswaded that the King would
not set up He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, <pb n="260" facs="tcp:104314:154"/> since he passed so severe an Act
against it; and it made the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Suppression of Monasteries go the more
easily thorough. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Clergy liked all the Act very well, except that
severe branch of it against their unchast practices. This was put in by
<hi>Cromwel</hi> to make it cut with both edges. (Some of our inconsiderate
Writers, who never perused the Statutes, tell us it was done by a different Act
of Parliament; but greater faults must be forgiven them who write upon
hearsay.) There was but one comfort that the poor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers could pick out of
the whole Act, that they were not left to the Mercy of the Clergy, and their
Ecclesiastical Courts, but were to be tryed by a Jury; where they might expect
more candid and gentle dealing. Yet the denying them the benefit of Abjuration,
was a severity beyond what had ever been put in practise before: So now they
began to prepare for new storms and a heavy persecution.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">An Act about the Suppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the greater
  Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries.</note>The other chief business of this Parliament was the
Suppression of Monasteries. It is said in the Preamble of that Act, 
<q>That divers Abbots. Priors, and other Heads of Religious Houses,
  had, since the 4th of <hi>February</hi> in the 27th year of the Kings Reign,
  without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, of their own accord, and according to the due course of
  the Common Law, by sufficient writings of Record, under their Covent-Seals,
  given up their Houses and all that belonged to them to the King. Therefore all
  Houses that were since that time sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, dissolved, relinquished,
  forfeited, or given up, are Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the King and his Successors for ever:
  And all Monasteries that should thereafter be suppressed, forfeited, or given
  up, are also Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to the King and his Successors. And all these Houses,
  with the Rents belonging to them, were to be disposed of by the Court of
  Augmentations for the Kings profit; excepting only such as were come into the
  Kings hands by Attaindors of Treason, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Exchequer.
  Reserving to all persons, except the Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trons, Founders, and Donors of such
  Houses, the same right to any parts of them, or jurisdiction in them, which
  they could have claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if that Act had never been made. Then followed many
  clauses for Annulling all Deeds and Leases, made within one year before the
  Suppression of any Religious House, to the prejudice of it, or different from
  what had been granted formerly. And all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or Chappels, which belonged
  to these Monasteries, and were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly exempted from the Visitation or
  Jurisdiction of their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are declared to be within the Jurisdiction of
  the Bishop, of the Diocess, or of any other that should be appointed by the
  King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Act passed in the House of Peers, without any Protestation
made by any of the Abbots, though it appears by the Journal that at the first
reading of it, there were eighteen Abbots present, at the second reading
twenty, and seventeen at the third reading, and the Abbots of <hi>Glastenbury
Colchester</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> were among those who were present; so
little reason there is to think they were attainted for any open withstanding
the Kings proceedings, when they did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against this Act, which was
so plainly levelled at them. It was soon dispatched by the Commons; and offered
to the Royal Assent. By it, no Religious Houses were suppressed, as is
generally taken for granted; but only the Surrenders, that either had been, or
were to <pb n="261" facs="tcp:104314:154"/> be made, were Confirmed. The last Proviso for
Annulling all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions of Churches and Chappels, had been a great happiness
to the Church, if it had not been for that Clause; <hi>That the King might
appoint others to visit them</hi>; which in a great degree did enervate it. For
many of those who afterwards purchased these Lands with the Impropriated
Tithes, got this likewise in their Grants, that they should be the Visitors of
the Churches and Chappels formerly exempted: from whence great disorders have
since followed in these Churches, which not falling within the Bishops
Jurisdiction, are thought not lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Censures; so that the Incumbents
in them, being under no restraints, have often been scandalous to the Church;
and given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to those who were disaffected to the Hierarchy, to censure
the Prelates, for these offences which they could not punish; since the
offenders were thus excepted out of their Jurisdiction. This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, which
first sprang from the Ancient Exemptions that were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed or Granted by the
See of <hi>Rome,</hi> has not yet met with an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Remedy.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, this Suppression of Abbies was universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
censured, and besides the common Exceptions which those that favoured the old
Superstition, made, it was questioned whether the Lands that formerly belonged
to Religious Houses, ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Founders and Donors by way
of <hi>Reverter,</hi> or to have fallen to the Lords of whom the Lands were
holden by way of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat,</hi> or to have come to the Crown. It is true,
by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, or at least by a Judgment of the Senate in
<hi>Theodosius</hi>'s time, the Endowments of the Heathenish Temples were upon
a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, whether they should return to the right Heirs, or be
Confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, in the end adjudged to the <hi>Fisc</hi> or the Emperors
Exchequer; upon this reason, that by the will of the Donors, they were total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alienated from them and their Heirs. But in <hi>England</hi> it went
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. And when the Order of the Knights-Templers was dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was
then judged in favour of the Lord by Escheat. For though the Founders and
Donors had totally alienated these Lands from themselves and their heirs, yet
there was no reason from thence to conclude any thing that might wrong the
Superior Lord of his Right in the case of an Escheat. And this must have held
good, if those alienations and Endowments had been absolute without any
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But the Endowments being generally rather of the Nature of
Covenants and Contracts, and made in Consideration of so many Masses to be said
for their Souls, then it was most just, that, upon a non-performance of the
Condition, and when that publick Error and Cheat which the Monks had put upon
the World was discovered, the Lands should have returned to the Founders and
Patrons and their Heirs and Successors. Nor was there any grounds for the Lords
to pretend to them by Escheat, especially where their Ancestors had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to, and confirmed those Endowments. Therefore there was no need of Excluding
them by any special Proviso. But for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Donors, certainly if
there had not been a Particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so made against them, they might have
recovered the Lands which their Ancestors had superstitiously given away; and
the Surrenders which Religious persons made to the Crown, could not have cut
off <pb n="262" facs="tcp:104314:155"/> their Title. But this Act did that effectually. It
is true, many of the greatest of them were of Royal Foundation, and these would
have returned to the Crown without Dispute.</p>
            <p>On the 23 of <hi>May,</hi> in this Session of Parliament a Bill
was brought in by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for giving the King Power to Erect new
Bishopricks by his Letters Patents.<note place="margin">Another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the
  Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks.</note> It was read that day for the first, second,
and third time; and sent down to the Commons. The Preamble of it was, 
<q>That it was known what slothful and ungodly Life had been led by
  those who were called Religious. But that these Houses might be converted to
  better uses; that Gods word might be better set forth, Children brought up in
  Learning, Clarks nourished in the Universities, and that old decayed Servants
  might have Livings, poor people might have Alms-Houses to maintain them,
  Readers of <hi>Greek, Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> might have good
  Stipend, daily Alms might be Ministred, and Allowance might be made for mending
  of the high-ways, and Exhibition for Ministers of the Church, for these ends,
  if the King thought fit to have more Bishopricks or Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Churches erected
  out of the Reat of these Houses; full Power was given to him to erect, and
  found them; and to make Rules and Statutes for them, and such Translations of
  Sees or divisions of them as he thought fit.</q> But on this Act I must adde a
singular Remark. The Preamble and material parts of it, were drawn by the King
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and the first draught of it under his hand is yet extant; which shows
his extraordinary application and understanding of business. But in the same
Paper there is a List of the Sees which he intended to found; of which what was
done afterwards came so far short, that I know nothing to which it can be so
reasonably imputed, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of <hi>Cranmers</hi> Interest at Court;
who had proposed the Erecting of new Cathedrals and Sees, with other things
mentioned in the Preamble of the Statute, as a great mean for Reforming the
Church. The Sees which the King then designed, with the Abbies out of which
they were to be Erected,<note place="margin">The Kings design about these.</note>
follow, as it is in the Paper under the Kings own hand.</p>

<hi>Shropshire,</hi> bearing date the 24th of <hi>August</hi> this year. So it
seems the See of <hi>Chester</hi> was Erected and endowed before the Act
passed, though there is among the Rolls a Charter for Endowing and founding of
it afterwards. <hi>Bristow</hi> is not mentioned in this Paper, though a See
was afterwards Erected there. It was not before the end of the next year that
these Sees were founded; and there was in that Interval so great a Change made,
both of the Counsels and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that no wonder the things now designed
were never accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</p>
            <p>Another Act passed in this Parliament,<note place="margin">An Act
  about the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations.</note> concerning the obedience due to the
Kings Proclamations. There had been great exceptions made to the Legality of
the Kings proceedings, in the Articles about Religion, and other Injunctions
published by his authority, which were complained of as contrary to Law; since
by these the King had without consent of Parliament, altered some Laws, and had
laid Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es on his Spiritual Subjects. 
<q>Upon which an Act passed, which sets forth in the preamble, the
  contempt and disobedience of the Kings Proclamations, by some who did not
  consider what a King by his Royal power might do; which if it continued, would
  tend to the disobedience of the Laws of God, and the dishonour of the Kings
  Majesty, (who may full ill bear it.) Considering also, that many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
  might require speedy Remedies, and that delaying these till a Parliament met,
  might occasion great prejudices to the Realm; and that the King by his Royal
  power given of God, might do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in such cases; Therefore it is
  Enacted, That the King for the time being, with advice of his Council, might
  set forth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations with pains and penalties in them, which were to be
  o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed as if they were made by an Act of Parliament. But this was not to be so
  extended, that any of the Kings Subjects should suffer in their Estates,
  Liberties, or Persons, by vertue of it: Nor that by any of the Kings
  Proclamations, Laws or Customs were to be broken and subverted.</q> Then follow
some Clauses about the publishing of Proclamations, and the way of prosecuting
those who contemned and disobeyed them. It is also added, 
<q>That if any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended against them, and in further contempt went
  out of the Realm, he was to be adjudged a Traitor. This also gave power to the
  Counsellours of the Kings Successor, if he were under age, to set forth
  Proclamations in his name, which were to be obeyed in the same manner with
  these set forth by the King himself.</q> This Act gave great power to the
Judges, since there were such Restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in some branches of it, which
seemed to lessen the great extent <pb n="264" facs="tcp:104314:156"/> of the other parts of
it; so that the Expositors of the Law had much referred to them: upon this Act
were the great changes of Religion in the Non-age of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th
grounded.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">An Act about Precedence.</note>There is another
Act, which but collaterally belongs to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs; and therefore
shall be but slightly touched. It is the Act of the Precedency of the Officers
of State, by which the Lord Vice-gerent has the Precedence of all persons in
the Kingdom next the Royal Family: and on this I must make one Remark, which
may seem very improper for one of my profession; especially when it is an
animadversion on one of the greatest men that any age has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the most
Learned Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi> He in his Titles of Honour, sayes, 
<q>That this Statute was never printed in the Statute-Book, and but
  incorrectly by another, and that therefore he infers it Literally as is in the
  Record.</q> In which there are two mistakes. For it is Printed in the
Statute-Book, that was set down in that Kings Reign, though left out in some
latter Statute-Books; and that which he prints, is not exactly according to the
Record. For as he prints it, the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> is not named in the
precedency; which is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Parliament-Roll, in which the Bishop
of <hi>London</hi> has the precedence next the Arch-Bishop of <hi>York</hi>;
and though this is corrected in a Posthumous edition; yet in that set out by
himself, it is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: Nor is that Omission among the Errours of the Press,
for though there are many of these gathered to be amended, this is none of
them. This I do not take notice of out of any vanity, or humour of Censuring a
man so great in all sorts of Learning; but my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is only to let ingenious
persons see, that they ought not to take things on trust easily, no not from
the greatest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
            <p>These are all the publick Acts that relate to Religion, which were
passed in this Parliament.<note place="margin">Some Acts of Attainders.</note>
With these there passed an Act of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the Marquess of
<hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Montacute,</hi> with many others, that were
either found to have had a great hand in the late Rebellion; or were discovered
to hold correspondence with Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> who was then trafficking
with forreign Princes, and projecting a League among them against the King. But
of this I shall give a more full account at the end of this Book; being there
to open the grounds of all the Attaindors that were passed in these last years
of the Kings Reign. There is one remarkable thing that belongs to this Act.</p>
            <p>Some were to be attainted in absence; others they had no mind to
bring to make their answer, but yet designed to attain them. Such were the
Marchioness of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Countess of <hi>Sarum,</hi> Mother to
Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> whom by a gross mistake, <hi>Speed</hi> fancies to have
been condemned without Arraignment or Tryal, as <hi>Cromwel</hi> had been by
Parliament. For she was now condemned a year before him. About the Justice of
doing this there was some debate; and to clear it, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> sent for
the Judges, and asked their opinions, Whether a man might be attainted in
Parliament without being brought to make his answer? They said it was a
dangerous Question. That the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament ought to be an example to all
inferiour Courts; and that when any person was charged with a Crime, he, by the
common Rule of <pb n="265" facs="tcp:104314:156"/> Justice and Equity should be heard to
plead for himself. But the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being the Supream Court of the Nation,
what way soever they proceeded, it must be good in Law; and it could never be
que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, whether the party was brought to answer or not. And thus a very
ill president was made, by which the most innocent person in the world might be
ruined. And this, as has often been observed in the like cases, fell very soon
heavily on the Author of the Counsel, as shall appear.</p>
            <p>When the Parliament was Prorogued, on the 28th of
<hi>Iune,</hi>

               </note> the King
apprehending that the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> might be much cast
down with the Act for the six Articles, sent for him and told him; That he had
heard how much, and with what Learning he had argued against it, and therefore
he desired he would put all his arguments in writing, and bring them to him.
Next day he sent the Dukes of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to dine with him. Ordering them to assure him of the
Kings constant and unshaken kindness to him, and to encourage him all they
could. When they were at Table with him at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> they run out much
on his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and acknowledged he had opposed the Act with so much
Learning, Gravity and Eloquence; that even those that differed from him were
much taken with what he said, and that he needed fear nothing from the King.
<hi>Cromwel</hi> saying, that this difference the King put between him, and all
his other Councellors; that when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were brought of others, the King
received them, and tried the truth of them; but he would not so much as hearken
to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Arch-Bishop. From that he went on to make a Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
between him and Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi>: That the one lost his Friends by his
haughtiness and pride, but the other gained on his Enemies by his gentleness
and mildness. Upon which the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> said, he might best speak
of the Cardinal, for he knew him well, having been his man. This nettled
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> who answered, that though he had served him, yet he never
liked his manners: and that though the Cardinal had designed, (if his attempt
for the Popedome had been successful,) to have made him his Admiral; yet he had
resolved not to accept of it, nor to leave his Countrey. To which the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk</hi> replied with a deep Oath, <hi>That he Lied</hi>; with other
reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful language. This troubled <hi>Cranmer</hi> extremely, who did all he
could to quiet and reconcile them. But now the Enmity between those two great
Ministers broke out to that height, that they were never afterwards hearty
friends.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Cranmer</hi> went about that which the King had commanded:
and made a Book of the reasons that led him to oppose the six Articles in which
the places out of the Scriptures,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cranmer</hi> writes his
  reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the six Articles.</note> the Authorities of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Doctors, with the arguments drawn from these, were all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested in a good
method. This he commanded his Secretary to write out in a fair hand, that it
might be given the King. The Secretary returning with it from <hi>Croydon,</hi>
where the Arch-Bishop was then, to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> found the Key of his
Chamber was carried away by the Arch-Bishops Almoner: So that he being obliged
to go over to <hi>London,</hi> and not daring to trust the Book to any others
keeping, carried it with himself; where both he and the Book met with an
un-lookt-for <pb n="266" facs="tcp:104314:157"/> encounter.<note place="margin">1538.</note>
Some others that were with him in the Wherry, would needs go to the
<hi>South-wark</hi> side, to look on a Bear-baiting that was near the River,
where the King was in person. The Bear broke loose into the River, and the Dogs
after her. They that were in the Boat leaped out, and left the poor Secretary
alone there. But the Bear got into the Boat, with the Dogs about her, and sunk
it. The Secretary apprehending his life was in danger, did not mind his Book,
which he lost in the water. But being quickly rescued, and brought to land, he
begun to look for his Book, and saw it floating in the River. So he desired the
Bear-ward to bring it to him; who took it up, but before he would restore it,
put it into the hands of a Priest that stood there, to see what it might
contain. The Priest reading a little in it found it a Confutation of the six
Articles: and told the Bearward that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever claimed it, would be hanged for
his pains. But the Arch-Bishops Secretary thinking to mend the matter, said it
was his Lords Book. This made the Bear-ward more intractable, for he was a
spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Papist, and hated the Arch-Bishop; so that no offers nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
could prevail with him to give it back. Whereupon <hi>Morice,</hi> (that was
the Secretaries name,) went and opened the matter to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> the next
day, <hi>Cromwel</hi> was then going to Court, and he expected to find the
Bearward there, looking to deliver the Book to some of <hi>Cranmers</hi>
Enemies; he therefore ordered <hi>Morice</hi> to go along with him. Where, as
they had expected, they found the fellow with the Book about him; upon whom
<hi>Cromwel</hi> called, and took the Book out of his hands, threatning him
severely for his presumption in medling with a Privy Councellors Book.</p>
            <p>But though <hi>Cranmer</hi> escaped this hazard, yet in
<hi>London</hi> the storm of the late act was falling heavily on them that were
obnoxious.<note place="margin">Proceedings upon that Act.</note>
               <hi>Shax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Latimer,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and
<hi>Worcester,</hi> within a week after the Session of Parliament, as it
appears, resigned their Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks. For on the 7th of <hi>Iuly</hi> the
Chapters of these Churches Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the King for his leave to fill those
Sees, they being then vacant by the free Resignation of the former Bishops.
Upon which the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge d'Elire</hi> for both was granted. Nor was this all,
but they being presented as having spoken against the six Articles, were put in
Prison, where the one lay till the King died, and the other till a little
before his death, as shall be shewn in its proper place. There were also
Commissions issued out, for proceeding upon that Statute: and those who were
Commissioned for <hi>London,</hi> were all secret favourers of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; so they
proceeded most severely, and examined many Witnesses against all who were
presented: whom they Interrogated not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the express words of the
Statute, but upon all such collateral or presumptive circumstances, as might
entangle them, or conclude them guilty. So that in a very little while 500
persons were put in prison, and involved in the breach of the Statute. Upon
this not only <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> but the Duke of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Audley</hi> the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour represented to the King
how hard it would be, and of what ill consequence, to execute the Law upon so
many persons. So the King was prevailed with to pardon them all; and I find no
further procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon this Statute till <hi>Cromwel</hi> fell.</p>
            <p>But the opposite Party used all the Arts possible to insinnuate
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <pb n="267" facs="tcp:104314:157"/> into the King. And therefore,<note place="margin">1539.</note> to shew how far their compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance would go,
<hi>Bonner</hi> took a strange commission from the King, on the 12th of
<hi>November</hi> this year. It has been certainly Enrolled; but it is not
there now, so that I judge it was razed in that suppression of Records, which
was in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time. But, as men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more careless at
home, <hi>Bonner</hi> has left it on Record in his own Register. Whether the
other Bishops took such Commissions from this King, I know not. But I am
certain there is none such in <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> Register: and it is not
likely, if any such had been taken out by him, that ever it would have been
razed. The Commission it self will be found in the Collection of Papers at the
end. The substance of it is, 
<q>That since all Jurisdictions both Ecclesiastical and Civil,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> flowed from the King as Supream Head, and he was the
  foundation of all power; it became those who exercised it only
  (<hi>Precario</hi>) at the Kings courtesie, gratefully to acknowledge, that
  they had it only of his bounty; and to declare that they would deliver it up
  again, when it should please him to call for it. And since the King had
  consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> his Vice-gerent in Ecclesiastical
  affairs; yet because he could not look into all those Matters, therefore the
  King, upon <hi>Bonners</hi> petition, did Empower him in his own stead, to
  ordain such as he found worthy, to present and give institution, with all the
  other parts of Episcopal Authority, for which he is duely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionated; and
  this to last during the Kings pleasure only. And, all the parts of the
  Episcopal Function being reckoned up, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a strict Charge to the
  Bishop to Ordain none but such of whose Integrity, good life and learning he
  had very good assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For as the Corruptions of the Christian Doctrine, and
  of mens manners, had chiefly proceeded from ill Pastours; so it was not to be
  doubted, but good Pastours well-chosen would again reform the Christian
  Doctrine, and the Lives of Christians.</q> After he had taken this Commission,
<hi>Bonner</hi> might have been well called one of the <hi>Kings Bishops.</hi>
The true reason of this profound Compliance, was, That the Popish party
apprehended that <hi>Cranmers</hi> great interest with the King, was chiefly
grounded on some opinions he had, of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Officers being as much
subject to the Kings power as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Civil Officers were. And this having
endeared him so much to the King, therefore they resolved to out-do him in that
point. But there was this difference, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> was once of that
opinion; and if he followed it at all, it was out of Conscience: but
<hi>Bonner,</hi> against his Conscience, (if he had any,) complied with it.</p>
            <p>Now followed the final dissolution of the Abbeys; there are 57
Surrenders upon Record this year. The originals of about 30 of these are yet to
be seen. Thirty seven of them were Abbies or Priories,<note place="margin">Dissolution of the great Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies.</note> and 20 Nunneries. The
good House of <hi>Godstow</hi> now fell with the rest, though among the last of
them. Now the great Parliament Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots surrendred apace; as those of
<hi>Westminster,</hi> St. <hi>Albans,</hi> St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundsbury,
Canterbury,</hi> St. <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>York, Selby,</hi> St. <hi>Peters</hi>
in <hi>Glocester, Cirencester, Waltham, Winchcombe, Malmsbury</hi> and
<hi>Battel.</hi> Three others were attainted; <hi>Glassenbury, Reading,</hi>
and <hi>Colchester.</hi> The Deeds of the rest are lost. Here it will not be
unacceptable to the Reader, to know who were the Parliamentary Abbots. There
were in all 28, as they <pb n="268" facs="tcp:104314:158"/> were commonly given.
<hi>Fuller</hi> has given a Catalogue of them in three places of his History of
<hi>Abbies</hi>; but as every one of these differs from the others; so none of
them are according to the Journals of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; The Lord <hi>Herbert</hi>
is also mistaken in his account. I shall not rise higher in my enquiry than
this Reign, for anciently many more Abbots and Priors sate in Parliament,
beside other Clergy that had likewise their Writs; and of whose right to sit in
the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, there was a question moved in <hi>Edward</hi> the sixths
Reign, as shall be opened in its proper place. Much less will I presume to
deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine so great a point in Law, whether they sate in the House of Lords, as
being a part of the Ecclesiastical State, or as holding their Lands of the King
by Baronage? I am only to observe the matter of fact, which is, That in the
Journals of Parliament in this Reign, these 28 Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots had their writs,
<hi>Abington,</hi> St. <hi>Albans,</hi> St. <hi>Austins Canterbury,
Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,</hi> St. <hi>Bennets</hi> in the <hi>Holm, Berdeny, Cirencester,
Colchester, Coventry, Croyland,</hi> St. <hi>Edmundsbury, Evesham, Glassenbury,
Glocester, Hide, Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>York,

Westminster</hi> and <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelcomh</hi>; to whom also the Prior of St.
<hi>Iohns</hi> may be added. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all these, I find that in the 28 year
of this King, the Abbot of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> upon <hi>Trent</hi> sate in
Parliament. Generally <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Burton</hi> were held by the
same man, as one Bishop held both <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi>
though two different Bishopricks; but in that year they were held by two
different persons, and both had their Writts to that Parliament. The method
used in the suppression of these Houses will appear by one compleat Report
made, of the Suppression of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey of <hi>Tewksbury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</note> which out of
many I copyed, and is in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. From it the Reader will see, what
provision was made for the Abbot, the Prior, the other Officers, and the Monks,
and other servants of the House; and what Buildings they ordered to be defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and what to remain; and how they did estimate the Jewels, Plate, and other
Ornaments. But Monasteries were not sufficient to stop the appetite of some
that were about the King; for Hospitals were next lookt after. One of these was
this year surrendred by <hi>Thomas Thirleby</hi> with two other Priests;<note place="margin">Some Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> he was Master of St.
<hi>Thomas</hi> Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and was designed Bishop of
<hi>Westminster,</hi> to which he made his way by that Resignation. He was a
learned and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest man, but of so fickle or cowardly a temper, that he turned
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with the Stream in every change that was made, till Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown; but then, being ashamed of so many turns,
he resolved to shew he could once be firm to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Abbeys sold or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away.</note>Now were
all the Monasteries of <hi>England</hi> suppressed, and the King had then in
his hand the greatest opportunity of making Royal and Noble Foundations, that
ever King of <hi>England</hi> had. But whether out of policy to give a general
Content to the Gentry, by selling to them at low rates, or out of easiness to
his Courtiers, or out of an unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured lavishness in his expence, it came far
short of what he had given out he would do, and what himself seemed once to
have design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The clear yeerly value of all the Suppressed Houses is cast up,
in an account then stated to be <hi>viz.</hi> 131607. <hi>lib.</hi> 6.
<hi>s.</hi> 4. <hi>d.</hi> as the Rents <pb n="269" facs="tcp:104314:158"/> were then rated,
but was at least ten times so much in true value. Of which he designed to
convert 18000. <hi>lib.</hi> into a Revenue for eighteen Bishopricks and
Cathedrals. But of these he only erected six, as shall be afterwards shewn.
Great sums were indeed laid out on building and fortifying many Ports, in the
Channel, and other parts of <hi>England,</hi> which were raised by the Sale of
Abbey-Lands.</p>
            <p>At this time many were offering projects for Noble Foundations, on
which the King seemed very earnest: But it is very likely,<note place="margin">A

himself in his Bounty, that it was not possible for him to bring these to any
effect. Yet I shall set down one of the projects, which shews the greatness of
his mind that designed it; that is, of Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> who was
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards one of the wisest Ministers that ever this Nation bred. The King
designed to found a House for the Study of the Civil Law, and the purity of the
<hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Tongues: So he ordered Sir <hi>Nicolas
Bacon,</hi> and two others, <hi>Thomas De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

nature, and orders of such a House, who brought it to him in a writing; the
original whereof is yet ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The design of it was, that there should be frequent pleadings, and other
exercises in the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>French</hi> tongues: and when the
Kings Students were brought to some ripeness, they should be sent with his
Embassadors to Forreign parts, and trained up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of forreign
affairs; and so the House should be the Nursery for Ambassadors. Some were also
to be appointed to write the History of all Embassies, Treaties, and other
foreign Transactions: as also of all Arraignments, and publick Tryals at home.
But before any of them might write on these Subjects, the Lord Chancellour was
to give them an Oath, that they should do it truly, without respect of persons,
or any other corrupt affection. This noble Design miscarried. But if it had
been well laid and regulated, it is easie to gather what great and publick
advantages might have flowed from it. Among which, it is not inconsiderable,
that we should have been delivered from a Rabble of ill-Writers of History, who
have without due care or enquiry, delivered to us the Transactions of that time
so imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there is still need of enquiring into Registers and
Papers for these matters. Which in such a House had been more certainly and
clearly conveighed to posterity, than can be now expected, at such a distance
of time; and after such a rasure of Records, and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions, in which
many of these Papers have been lost. And this help was the more necessary,
after the suppression of Religious Houses: in most of which a Chronicle of the
times was kept, and still filled up as new Transactions came to their knowledg.
It is true, most of these were written by men of weak Judgments, who were more
pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in delivering Fables and Trifles, than in opening observable
Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions. Yet some of them were men of better understandings; and it is
like were directed by their Abbots, who being Lords of Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>fairs well: only an
invincible humor of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it might raise the credit of their Religion,
or Order, or House, runs through all their Manuscripts.</p>
            <p>One thing was very remarkable, which was this year granted, at 
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:104314:159"/> 
               <hi>Cranmers</hi> Intercession. There was nothing could
so much recover Reformation, that was declining so fast, as the free use of the
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;<note place="margin">A Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation about the free use of the
  Scriptures.</note> and though these had been set up in the Churches a year ago,
yet he pressed, and now procured leave, for private persons to buy Bibles, and
keep them in their Houses. So this was granted by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents directed to
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> bearing date the 13th of <hi>November.</hi> The Substance of
which was,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <q>That the King was desirous to have his Subjects attain the
  knowledg of Gods word, which could not be effected by any means so well, as by
  granting them the free and liberal use of the Bible in the <hi>English</hi>
  tongue; which to avoid dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sension, he intended should pass among them only by
  one Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore <hi>Cromwel</hi> was charged to take care, that for
  the space of five years there should be no Impression of the Bible, or any part
  of it, but only by such as should be assigned by him.</q> But <hi>Gardiner</hi>
opposed this, all he could: and one day, in a Conference before the King, he
provoked <hi>Cranmer</hi> to shew any difference between the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the
Scriptures, and of the Apostolical Canons, which he pretended were equal to the
other writings of the Apostles. Upon which, they disputed for some time. But
the King perceived solid Learning tempered with great Modesty in what
<hi>Cranmer</hi> said; and nothing but vanity and affectation in
<hi>Gardiner</hi>'s reasonings. So he took him up sharply, and told him, that
<hi>Cranmer</hi> was an old and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Captain, and was not to be
troubled by fresh-men and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
            <p>The great matter of the Kings Marriage came on at this time. Many
reports were brought the King of the beauty of <hi>Anne</hi> of
<hi>Cleve,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to Mary <hi>Anne</hi> of
  <hi>Cleve.</hi>
               </note> so that he inclined to ally himself with that Family.
Both the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and the King of <hi>France,</hi> had courted him to Matches
which they had projected. The Emperor proposed the Dutchess of <hi>Milan,</hi>
his kinswoman, and Daughter to the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> He was then
designing to break the League of <hi>Smalcald,</hi> and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self master
of <hi>Germany</hi>: And therefore he took much pains with the King, to divide
him from the Princes there; which was in great part effected by the Statute for
the six Articles: Upon which the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors of the Princes had complained,
and said, That whereas the King had been in so fair a way of union with them,
he had now broke it off, and made so severe a Law about Communion in one kind,
Private Masses, and the Celibate of the Clergy, which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much from
their Doctrine, that they could entertain no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther correspondence with him,
if that Law was not mitigated. But <hi>Gardiner</hi> wrought much on the Kings
vanity and passions; and told him that it was below his Dignity, and high
Learning, to have a Company of dull <hi>Germans</hi> and small Princes, dictate
to him in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. There was also another thing which he oft made
use of, (though it argues somewhere a great Ignorance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of
the Empire,) That the King could not expect these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would ever be for
his Supremacy; since if they acknowledged that in him, they must likewise yield
it to the Emperor. This was a great mistake. For as the Princes of
<hi>Germany</hi> never acknowledged the Emperor to have a sove raignty in their
Dominions; so they did acknowledg the Diet, in which the Soveraignty of the
Empire lies, <pb n="271" facs="tcp:104314:159"/> to have a Power of making or changing what
Laws they pleased a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion.<note place="margin">1538.</note> And in things
that were not determined by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, every Prince pretended to it as highly
in his own Dominions, as the King could do in <hi>England.</hi> But as untrue
as this Allegation was it served <hi>Gardiner's</hi> turn; for the King was
sufficiently irritated with it against the Princes, so that there was now a
great coldness in their correspondence. Yet the Project of a Match with the
Dutchess of <hi>Milan</hi> failing, and these proposed by <hi>France</hi> not
being acceptable, <hi>Cromwel</hi> moved the King about an Alliance with the
Duke of <hi>Cleve</hi>; who, as he was the Emperors Neighbour in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> had also a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension to the Dutchie of <hi>Guelders,</hi>
and his eldest Daughter was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the Duke of <hi>Saxony.</hi> So that
the King having then some apprehensions of a War with the Emperor, this seemed
a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Alliance to give him a Diversion.</p>
            <p>There had been a Treaty between her Father, and the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> in order to a match between the Duke of <hi>Lorrain's</hi>
Son, and her. But they both being under Age, it went no further than a Contract
between their Fathers. <hi>Hans Holbin</hi> having taken her Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, sent it
over to the King. But in that he bestowed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon complement of his Art,
somewhat too liberally, on a Lady that was in a way to be Queen. The King liked
the Picture, better than the Original, when he had the occasion afterwards to
compare them. The Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who was very zealous for the
<hi>Aus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, finding
the King had declined so much from it, disswaded the Match. But
<hi>Cromwel</hi> set it on mightily; expecting a great Support from a Queen of
his own making: whose friends being all <hi>Luth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rans,</hi> it tended also to bring down the Popish Party
at Court, and again to recover the ground they had now lost. Those that had
seen the Lady did much commend her beauty, and person. But she could speak no
Language but <hi>Dutch</hi>; to which the King was a stranger. Nor was she bred
to Musick, with which the King was much taken. So that except her person had
charmed him, there was nothing left for her to gain upon him by. After some
Months Treaty, one of the Counts Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> with other
Ambassadors from the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and her Brother the Duke of
<hi>Cleves,</hi> (for her Father was lately dead,) came over, and concluded the
Match.</p>
            <p>In the end of <hi>December,</hi> she was brought over to
<hi>England</hi>:<note place="margin">Who comes over to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note>
And the King, being impatient to see her, went down <hi>Incognito</hi> to
<hi>Rochester.</hi> But when he had a sight of her, finding none of these
charms which he was made believe were in her, he was so extreamly surprized,
that he not only did not like her, but took an Aversion to her, which he could
never after overcome. He swore they had brought over a <hi>Flanders</hi> Mare
to him, and was very sorry he had gone so far, but glad it had proceeded no
further. And presently he resolved,<note place="margin">But is much disliked by
  the King.</note> if it were possible, to break off the matter, and never to
yoke himself with her. But his Affairs were not then in such a condition, that
he could safely put that affront on the Dukes of <hi>Saxony</hi> and
<hi>Cleves</hi> which the sending back of this Lady would have done. For the
<hi>Germans,</hi> being of all Nations most sensible of every thing in which
the Honour of their Family is touched; he knew they would resent such an
Injury. And it was not safe for him to Adventure that at such 
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:104314:160"/> a time.<note place="margin">1539.</note> For the Emperor
was then in <hi>Paris,</hi> whither he had gone to an Enterview with
<hi>Francis.</hi> And his Reception was not only as Magnificent as could be,
but there was all the Evidence possible of hearty Friendship and kindness. The
King also understood, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them there was somewhat projected against
himself. And now <hi>Francis</hi> that had been as much obliged by him, as
possibly one Prince could be by another; was not only forgetful of it, but
intended to take advantage from the distractions and discontents of the
<hi>English,</hi> to drive them out of <hi>France,</hi> if it were possible.
And it is not to be doubted but the Emperor would gladly have embroyled these
two Kings, that he might have a better opportunity both to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Master
of <hi>Germany</hi>; and to force the King of <hi>England</hi> into an
Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, by which the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> should be Legitimated, and the
Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Germany</hi> be left destitute of a Support, which made them
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent and Intractable. The King apprehended the Conjunction of those two
great Princes against himself, which was much set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the Pope; and
that they would set up the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> against him, who with that
forreign Assistance, and the discontents at home, would have made War upon
great advantages; especially those in the North of <hi>England,</hi> being ill
affected to him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he judged it necessary for his Affairs not to
lose the Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> Only he resolved, first, to try if any
Nullities or Pre-contracts could excuse him fairly at their hands. He returned
to <hi>Greenwich</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Melancholy. He much blamed the Earl of
<hi>Southampton,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent over to receive her at <hi>Callice,</hi>
had written an high Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of her Beauty. But he excused himself, that
he thought the thing was so far gone, that it was decent to write as he had
done. The King lamented his condition in that Marriage; and expressed great
trouble, both to the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Brown,</hi> Sir
<hi>Anthony Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and others about him. 
<q>The last of those told him, this was one Advantage that mean
  persons had over Princes: That great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces must take such Wives as are
  brought them, whereas meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons go and chuse Wives for themselves.</q>
But when the King saw <hi>Cromwel,</hi> he gave his grief a freer vent to him.
He, finding the King so much Troubled, would have cast the chief blame on the
Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> for whom he had no great kindness: And said, when
he found her so far short of what reports and Pictures had made her, he should
have stayed her at <hi>Callice,</hi> till he had given the King notice of it.
But the Earls Commission being only to bring her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; he said, It had been
too great a presumption in him, to have interposed in such a manner. And the
King was convinced he was in the right. So now, all they had to insist on, was
the clearing of that Contract that had passed between her and the Marquess of
<hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>: which the Ambassadors, who had been with the King, had
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken should be fully done, and brought over with her in due form of Law.
So after the Lady was brought in great State to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> the Council
met, and sent for the Ambassadors of the Duke of <hi>Cleves</hi> that conducted
her over; and desired to see what they had brought for clearing the breach of
that Contract with the Marquess of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain.</hi> But they had brought
nothing, and made no account of it; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Contract was in their
Minority, when they could give <pb n="273" facs="tcp:104314:160"/> no consent; and that
nothing had followed on it, after they came to be of Age. But this did not
satisfie the Kings Council, who said, these were but their words, and they must
see better proofs. The Kings Marriage was Annulled with <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi>
upon a pre-contract; therefore he must not again run the like hazard. So
<hi>Olisleger</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sden,</hi> the Ambassadors from <hi>Cleve,</hi> did by a formal
Instrument Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test before <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that in a peace made between their
late Master <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Cleve,</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> one of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was, that this Lady being then under
Age, should be given in Marriage to <hi>Francis</hi> Son to the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> who was likewise under Age; which Treaty they affirmed they
saw and read. But that afterwards <hi>Henry de Groffe</hi> Ambassador of
<hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres,</hi> upon whose mediation that peace
had been concluded, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their hearing, that the Espousals were
Annulled and of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and that this was Registred in the Chancery of
<hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve,</hi> of which they
promised to bring an Authentical Extract within three Months to
<hi>England.</hi> Some of the Counsellors, who knew the Kings secret dislike of
her person, would have insisted more on this. But the Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Duresm,</hi> said, if there was no
more than that, it could be no just hindrance to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization of the
Marriage. So the King seeing there was no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and being much pressed both
by the Ministers of <hi>Cleve,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1540.</note> and by the
Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> Marryed her on the 6th of <hi>Ianuary</hi>: But
expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so much aversion and dislike of her,<note place="margin">But yet
  Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries her.</note> that every body about him took notice of it. Next day the
Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> asked him how he liked her then. He told him, <hi>He was
not every man</hi>; therefore he would be free with him: He liked her worse
than he did. He sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected she was no Maid; and had such ill smells about her,
that he loathed her more than ever, and did not believe he should ever
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate the Marriage. This was sad news to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who knew well
how delicate the King was in these matters;<note place="margin">And could never
  love her.</note> and that so great a Misfortune must needs turn very heavy on
him, that was the chief Promoter of it. He knew his Enemies would draw great
advantages from this; and understood the Kings temper too well, to think his
Greatness would last long, if he could not induce the King to like the Queen
better. But that was not to be done; for though the King lived five Months with
her in that State, and very oft lay in the Bed with her, yet his Aversion
rather encreased than abated. She seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not much concerned at it: and, as
their Conversation was not great, so she was of an heavy Composition, and was
not much displeased, to be delivered from a Marriage in which she had so
lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle satisfaction. Yet one thing shews that she wanted not Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For
she learned the <hi>English</hi> Language very soon: and before her Marriage
was Annulled, she spoke <hi>English</hi> freely, as appears by some of the
Depositions.</p>
            <p>There was an Instrument brought over from <hi>Cleve,</hi> taken
out of the Chancery there; by which it appeared, That <hi>Henry de Groffe,</hi>
Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador from the Duke of <hi>Gueldres,</hi> had on the 15th of
<hi>February</hi> in the year 1535. declared the Nullity of the former
Contract, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words, which are set down in high <hi>Dutch,</hi> but
thus put in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine. Sponsalia illa progressum suum non habitura</hi> (I
will not answer <pb n="274" facs="tcp:104314:161"/> for the <hi>Latine,</hi>) <hi>ex quo
dictus Dux Carolus admodum doleret, &amp; prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea quaedam fecisset, &amp;
amplius facturus esset.</hi> And <hi>Pallandus,</hi> that was Ambassador from
the Duke of <hi>Cleves</hi> in the Duke of <hi>Guelders</hi> Court, wrote to
his Master, <hi>Illustrissimum Ducem Gueldriae certo scire prima illa Sponsalia
inter Domicellam Annam fore inania &amp; progressum suum non habitura.</hi>
When this was shewed the King, his Council found great exceptions to it, upon
the Ambiguity of the word <hi>Sponsalia</hi>; it not being expressed, whether
they were Espousals by the words of the present, or of the future tense; and
intended to make use of that when there should be a fit opportunity for it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A Parliament called.</note>On the 12th of
<hi>April</hi> a Session of Parliament was held. The Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal shews that
neither the Abbot of <hi>Westminster,</hi> nor any other Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot was present.
After the Lord Chancellor had opened the reasons for the Kings meeting them at
that time, as they related to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government, <hi>Cromwel</hi> as Lord
Vice-gerent spake next in the Kings name; and said, 
<q>There was nothing which the King so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,<note place="margin">Where <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> speaks as Lord vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</note> as a
  firm union among all his Subjects, in which he placed his chief security. He
  knew there were many Incendiaries, and much Cockle grew up with the Wheat. The
  rashness and licentiousness of some, and the inveterate Superstition and
  stiffness of others in the Ancient Corruptions, had raised great dissensions to
  the sad regret of all good Christians. Some were called Papists, others
  He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; which bitterness of Spirit seemed the more strange, since now the
  Holy Scriptures, by the Kings great care of his people, were in all their
  hands, in a Language which they understood. But these were grosly perverted by
  both sides, who studied rather to justifie their passions out of them, than to
  direct their belief by them. The King leaned neither to the right nor to the
  left hand, neither to the one nor the other Party, but set the pure and
  sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Doctrine of the Christian Faith only before his eyes: And therefore
  was now resolved to have this set forth to his Subjects, without any corrupt
  mixtures; and to have such decent Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies continued, and the true use of
  them taught, by which all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses might be cut off, and Disputes about the
  Exposition of the Scriptures cease, that so all his Subjects might be well
  instructed in their Faith, and directed in the reverent worship of God; and
  resolved to punish severely all transgressors, of what sort or side soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
  they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were. The King was resolved, That Christ, That the Gospel of Christ,
  and the truth should have the victory. And therefore had appointed some Bishops
  and Divines to draw up an Exposition of those things that were necessary for
  the Institution of a Christian-man: Who were, the two Arch-Bishops, the Bishop
  of <hi>London, Duresm, Winchester, Rochester, Hereford,</hi> and St.
  <hi>Davids</hi>; and Doctors <hi>Thirleby, Robertson, Cox, Day, Oglethorp,
  Redmayn, Edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, Crayford, Symonds, Robins,</hi> and <hi>Tresham.</hi> He
  had also appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others to examine what Ceremonies should be retained, and
  what was the true use of them; who were the Bishops of <hi>Bath</hi> and
  <hi>Wells, Ely, Sarum, Chichester, Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Landaff.</hi> The
  King had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so commanded the Judges, and other Justices of the Peace, and
  persons commissioned for the Execution of the Act formerly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to proceed
  against all transgressors, and punish them according <pb n="275" facs="tcp:104314:161"/> to
  Law.<note place="margin">1540.</note> And he Concluded with an high Commendation
  of the King, whose due praises, he said, a man of far greater Eloquence than
  himself was, could not fully set forth.</q> The Lords approved of this
Nomination, and ordered that these Committees should sit constantly, on
Mundays, Wedensdays, and Fridays: and no other days they were to sit in the
afternoon. But their Proceedings will require so full a Relation, that I shall
first open the other Affairs that passed in this Session, and leave these to
the last.</p>
            <p>On the 14th of <hi>April</hi> the King created <hi>Cromwel</hi>

            <p>On the 22d of <hi>April,</hi> a Bill was brought in for
Suppressing the Knights of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Knights of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> at
  <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </note> Their first Foundation was to be a Guard to the
Pilgrims that went to the Holy Land. For some Ages that was extolled as the
highest expression of devotion and reverence to our Saviour, to go and view the
places of his abode; and chiefly the places where he was Crucified, Buried, and
ascended to Heaven. Upon which, many entred into a Religious Knighthood, who
were to defend the Holy Land, and conduct the Pilgrims. Those were of two
sorts; The <hi>Knights-Templars</hi> and <hi>Hospitallers.</hi> The former were
the greater and richer, but the other were also very considerable. The Popes
and their Clergy did every-where animate all Princes, and great persons, to
undertake expeditions into these parts: Which were very costly and dangerous,
and proved fatal to almost all the Princes that made them. Yet the belief of
the pains of Purgatory, from which all were delivered by the Popes Power, who
went on this Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; such as dyed in it being also reckoned Martyrs;
wrought won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully on a blind and Superstitious Age. But such as could not
go, were perswaded, That if on their death-beds they vowed to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their
recovery, and left some Lands to maintain a Knight that should go thither and
fight against the Infidels, it would do as well. Upon this, great and vast
Endowments were made. But there were many Complaints made of the
<hi>Templars,</hi> for betraying and robbing the Pilgrims, and other horrid
abuses, which may reasonably be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have been true; though other
Writers of that Age lay the blame rather on the Covetousness of the King of
<hi>France,</hi> and the Popes malice to them: Yet in a General Council the
whole Order was Condemned, and Suppressed, and such of them as could be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
were cruelly put to death. The Order of the <hi>Hospitallers</hi> stood, yet
did not grow much after that. They were beaten out of the <hi>Holy-Land</hi> by

at this time in <hi>Malta.</hi> Their great Master depended on the Pope and the
Emperor: so it was not thought fit, to let a House that was subject to a
Forreign Power stand longer. And it seems they would not willingly Surrender up
their House, as others had done. Therefore it was necessary to force them out
of it by an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; which on the 22d of <hi>April</hi> was read the
first time, and on the 26th the 2d time, and on the 29th the third time; by
which both <pb n="276" facs="tcp:104314:162"/> their House in <hi>England,</hi> and another
they had in <hi>Kilmainam</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> were suppressed, great
pensions being reserved by the Act to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, a 1000 <hi>lib.</hi> to him
of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> and 500 Marks to the other, with
very considerable allowances for the Knights, which in all amounted near to
3000 <hi>lib.</hi> yearly. But on the 14th of <hi>May</hi> the Parliament was
Prorogued to the 25th, and a vote passed that their Bills should remain in the

               </gap>eting, as they were going on in their business, a great Change of
Court broke out. For on the 13th of <hi>Iune,</hi> at the Council Table, the
Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> in the Kings name challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord
<hi>Cromwel</hi> of high Treason,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> and Arresting him,
sent him Prisoner to the Tower. He had many Enemies among all sorts of persons.
The Nobility despised him, and thought it lessened the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their
Titles, to see the Son of a Black-Smith raised so many degrees above them. His
aspiring to the Order of the Garter was thought inexcusable vanity: and his
having so many places heaped on him, as Lord Privy Seal, Lord Chamberlain of
<hi>England,</hi> and Lord Vice-gerent, with the Mastership of the Rolls, with
which he had but lately parted, drew much envy on him. All the Popish par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hated him out of measure. The Suppression of the Abbies was laid wholly at his
door: The Attaindors and all other severe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were imputed to his
Counsels. He was also thought to be the person that had kept the King and the
Emperor at such distance: And therefore the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and
<hi>Gardiner,</hi> beside private Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities, hated him on that account. And
they did not think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, if he were out of the way, to bring on a
Treaty with the Emperor; which they hoped would open the way for one with the
Pope. But other more secret reasons wrought his ruin with the King. The fear he
was in of a Conjunction between the Emperor and <hi>France</hi> did now abate:
For he understood that it went no further than Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements. And though he
clearly discovered, having sent over the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> to
<hi>Francis,</hi> that he was not to depend much on his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; yet at the
same time he knew that the Emperor would not yield up the Dutchy of
<hi>Milan</hi> to him, upon which his heart was much set. So he saw they could
come to no agreement. Therefore he made no great account of the loss of
<hi>France,</hi> since he knew the Emperor would willingly make an Alliance
with him: The hopes of which made him more indifferent, whether the
<hi>German</hi> Princes were pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what he did, or not: since he had
now attained the end he had proposed to himself in all his Negotiations with
them, which was to secure himself from any trouble the Emperor might give him.
Therefore <hi>Cromwels</hi> Counsels were now disliked, for he had always
enclined the King to favour those Princes against the Emperor. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother secret
cause was, that as the King had an unconquerable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to his Queen; so he
was taken with the Beauty and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Mistress <hi>Katharine Howard</hi>
Daughter to the Lord <hi>Edmond Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King in
  love with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress <hi>Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Howard.</hi>
               </note> a Brother of the Duke of
<hi>Norfolks.</hi> And as this designed Match raised the credit of her Uncle,
so the ill consequences of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer drew him down who had been the chief
Counsellor in it. The King also found his Government was grown uneasie, and
therefore judged it was no ill Policy to cast over all that had been done
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, <pb n="277" facs="tcp:104314:162"/> upon a Minister who had great Power with
him:<note place="margin">1539.</note> and being now in disgrace, all the blame of
these things would be taken off from the King, and laid on him, and his Ruin
would much appease discontents, and make them more moderate in censuring the
King or his Proceedings. It is said that other Particulars were charged on him,
which lost him the Kings favour. If this be true, it is like they related to
the encouragement he was said to have given to some Reformers, in the
opposition they made to the six Articles: Upon the Execution of which the King
was now much set. His fall was so secretly carryed, that though he had often
before looked for it, knowing the Kings uneasie and jealous temper; yet at that
time he had no apprehensions of it, till the Storm broke upon him. In his fall
he had the common fate of all disgraced Ministers, to be forsaken by his
Friends, and insulted over by his Enemies. Only <hi>Cranmer</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
still so much of his former simplicity, that he could never learn these Court
Arts.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cranmers</hi> friendship to
  <hi>Cromwel.</hi>
               </note> Therefore he wrote to the King about him next day, 
<q>He much magnified his diligence in the Kings service and
  preservation, and discovering all Plots as soon as they were made: That he had
  always loved the King above all things, and served him with great fidelity and
  success: That he thought no King of <hi>England</hi> had ever such a servant;
  upon that account he had loved him, as one that loved the King above all
  others. But if he was a Traytor, he was glad it was discovered. But he prayed
  God earnestly, to send the King such a Councellor in his stead, who could and
  would serve him as he had done.</q> This shews, both the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of
<hi>Cranmers</hi> friendship to him, and that he had a great Soul, not turned
by the changes of mens fortunes, to like or dislike them, as they stood or
declined from their greatness. And had not the Kings kindness for
<hi>Cranmer</hi> been deeply rooted, this Letter had ruined him. For he was the
most impatient of Contradiction, in such cases, that could be.
<hi>Cromwels</hi> ruin was now Decreed, and he who had so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily complyed
with the Kings pleasure in procuring some to be Attainted the year before,
without being brought to make their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, fell now under the same severity.
For whether it was that his Enemies knew, That if he were brought to the Bar he
would so justifie himself that they would find great difficulties in the
Process; or whether it was that they blindly resolved to follow that
injustifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Precedent, of passing over so necessary a Rule to all Courts, of
giving the Party accused an hearing; the Bill of Attaindor was brought in to
the House of Lords, <hi>Cranmer</hi> being absent that day, as appears by the
Journal on the 17th of <hi>Iune,</hi> and read the first time, and on the 19th
was read the second and third time, and sent down to the Commons. By which it
appears, how few friends he had in that House, when a Bill of that nature went
on so hastily. But it seems he found in the House of Commons somewhat of the
same measure, which ten years before he had dealt to the Cardinal, though not
with the same success. For his matter stuck ten days there. At length a new
Bill of Attaindor was brought up, conceived in the House of Commons, with a
Proviso annexed to it. They also sent back the Bill which the Lords sent to
them. But it is not clear from the Journals what they meant by these two Bills.
It seems they reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <pb n="278" facs="tcp:104314:163"/> the Lords Bill, and yet sent it
up with their own, either in re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spect to the Lords, or that they left it to
their choice, which of the two Bills they would offer to the Royal Assent. But
though this be an unparliamentary way of proceeding, I know no other sense
which the words of the Journal can bear, which I shall set down in the

  persons of honour, found him to be the most Corrupt Traitor,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.</note> and deceiver of the King and
  the Crown, that had ever been known in his whole Reign. He had taken upon him
  to set at liberty divers persons put in Prison for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prision of Treason, and
  others that were suspected of it. He had also received several bribes, and for
  them granted Licenses to carry Money, Corn, Horses, and other things out of the
  Kingdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Kings Proclamations. He had also given out many
  Commissions without the Kings knowledg; and being but of a base Birth, had
  said, <hi>That he was sure of the King.</hi> He had granted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Passports,
  both to the Kings Subjects and Forreigners for pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Seas, without
  search. He being also an Heretick, had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed many Erroneous Books among
  the Kings Subjects, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly some that were contrary to the Belief of the
  Sacrament. And when some had informed him of this, and had shewed him these
  Heresies in Books Printed in <hi>England,</hi> he said, <hi>they were good, and
  that he found no fault in them</hi>; and said, <hi>It was as Lawful for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
  Christian man to be the Minister of that Sacrament as a Priest.</hi> And
  whereas the King had constituted him Vice-gerent for the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affairs of
  the Church, he had under the Seal of that office li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed many that were
  suspected of Heresie to Preach over the Kingdom; and he had both by word and in
  writing suggested to several Sheriffs, That it was the Kings pleasure they
  should discharge many Prisoners, of whom some were Indicted, others apprehended
  for Heresie. And when many particular complaints were brought to him of
  detestable Heresies, with the names of the offenders; he not only defended the
  Hereticks, but severely checkt the Informers: and vexed some of them by
  Imprisonment, and other ways. The particulars of all which were too tedious to
  be recited. And he having entertained many of the Kings Subjects about himself,
  whom he had infected with Heresie, and imagining he was by force able to defend
  his Treasons and Heresies; on the last of <hi>March</hi> in the 30th year of
  the Kings Reign, in the Parish of St. <hi>Peters the poor</hi> in
  <hi>London,</hi> when some of them complained to him of the new Preachers, such
  as <hi>Barnes</hi> and others, he said; <hi>Their Preaching was good</hi>; and
  said also among other things, <hi>That if the King would turn from it, yet he
  would not turn: And if the King did turn, and</hi>

  himself; and extorted much Money from the Kings Subjects, and being greatly
  enriched, had treated the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility with much contempt. And on the last of
  <hi>Ianuary</hi> in the 31th year of the Kings Reign, in the Parish of St.
  <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields, when some had put him in mind to what the King
  had raised him, he said, <hi>If the Lords would handle him so, he would give

  proudest of them should know it.</hi> For all which Treasons and Heresies, he
  was At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted to suffer the pains of death, for Heresie and Treason, as should
  please the King, and to forfeit all his Estate and goods to the Kings use, that
  he had on the last of <hi>March</hi> in the 31st year of the Kings Reign, or
  since that time. There was added to this Bill, a Proviso; That this should not

            </p>
            <p>From these particulars the Reader will clearly see,<note place="margin">Censures past upon it.</note> why he was not brought to make his
answer, most of them relating to Orders and Directions he had given, for which
it is very probable he had the Kings Warrant. And for the matter of Heresie, it
has appeared how far the King had proceeded towards a Reformation, so that what
he did that way, was most likely done by the Kings Order: But the King now
falling from these things, it was thought they intended to stifle him by such
an Attaindor; that he might not discover the secret Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or directions given
him for his own Justification. For the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of Bribery and Extortion,
they being mentioned in general expressions, seem only cast into the heap to
defame him. But for those Treasonable words, it was generally thought that they
were a Contrivance of his Enemies: since it seemed a thing very extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
for a Favourite in the height of his Greatness to talk so rudely. And if he had
been guilty of it, <hi>Bedlam</hi> was thought a fitter place for his Restraint
than the <hi>Tower.</hi> Nor was it judged likely that he having such great and
watchful Enemies at Court, any such discourses could have layn so long secret:
Or if they had come to the Kings know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, he was not a Prince of such a
temper as to have forgiven, much less imployed and advanced a man after such
discourses. And to think that during these fifteen months, after the words were
said to have been spoken, none would have had the zeal for the King, or the
malice to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> as to repeat them, were things that could not be
believed. The formality of drawing his Dagger made it the more suspected; for
this was to affix an overt-Act to these words, which in the opinion of many
Lawyers was necessary to make words Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable. But as if these words had not
been ill enough, some wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters since have made them worse; as if he had said,
<hi>He would thrust his Dagger in the Kings heart</hi>: About which
<hi>Fuller</hi> hath made another <pb n="280" facs="tcp:104314:165"/> story to excuse these
words, as if they had not been meant of the King, but of another. But all that
is founded on a mistake, which, if he had looked in the Record, he had
corrected.</p>

  Queen.</note>
               <hi>Cromwels</hi> Fall was the first step towards the Kings
Divorce. For on the 24th of <hi>Iune</hi> he sent his Queen to
<hi>Richmond,</hi> pretending the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey air would agree better with her.
But on the 6th of <hi>Iuly</hi> a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made, and assented to in the
House of Lords, that they should make an address to the King, desiring him to
suffer his Marriage with the Queen to be tryed. Upon which, the Lord
Chancellor, the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Dukes of
<hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and
the Bishop of <hi>Duresm,</hi> were sent down to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; to represent the
matter to them, and to desire their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Address. To which they
agreed, and ordered twenty of their number to go along with the Peers. So the
whole House of Lords with these Commoners, went to the King; and told him they
had a matter of great consequence to propose to him, but it was of that
Importance that they first begged his leave to move it. That being obtained,
they desired the King would order a Tryal to be made, of the validity of his
Marriage. To which the King consented, and made a deep Protestation as in the
presence of God, that he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal nothing that related to it, and all
its circumstances; And that there was nothing he held dearer than the Glory of
God, the good of the Common-wealth, and the declaration of truth. So a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was issued out to the Convocation to try it.</p>

               <note place="margin">It's referred to the convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note>On the

will see a fuller account in the Collection at the end than is needful to be

Brown,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Denny,</hi> Doctor <hi>Chambers,</hi> and Doctor
<hi>Butts,</hi> the Kings Physicians, and of some Ladies that had talked with
the Queen. All which amounted to this; that the King expected that the
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contract with the Marquess of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reasons
  pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for it.</note> should have been more fully cleared. That the King
always disliked her, and Marryed her full sore against his heart; and since
that time he had never consummat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marriage. So the substance of the whole
evidence being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, it amounted to these three Particulars.
<hi>First,</hi> That there had been a Contract between the Marquess of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> and the Queen, which was not sufficiently cleared: for it did
not yet appear whether these Espousals were made by the Parties themselves, or
in the words of the present tense. Then it was said, That the King having
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed her against his will, he had not given a pure, inward, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
consent: And since a mans Act is only what is inward, extorted or forced
promises do not bind. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he had never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated the
Marriage. To which was added the great interest the whole Nation had in the
Kings having more issue, which they saw he <pb n="281" facs="tcp:104314:165"/> could never
have by the Queen.<note place="margin">1540.</note> This was furiously driven on
by the Popish Party. And <hi>Cranmer,</hi> whether overcome with these
arguments, or rather with fear, for he knew it was contrived to send him
quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after <hi>Cromwel,</hi> consented with the rest.<note place="margin">Convocation agreed to it. Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.</note> So
that the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation without one disagreeing Vote, Judged the marriage
null, and of no force: and that both the King, and the Lady, were free from the
bond of it.</p>
            <p>This was the greatest piece of Compliance that ever the King had
from the Clergy.<note place="margin">It is censured.</note> For as they all knew
there was nothing of weight in that praecontract; so they laid down a most
pernicious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, for invalidating all publick Treaties and Agreements:
since if one of the Parties being unwilling to it, so that his consent were not
inward, he was not bound by it, there was no safety among men more. For no man
can know whether another consents inwardly: And when a man does any thing with
great aversion, to infer from thence, that he does not inwardly consent, may
furnish every one with an excuse, to break loose from all engagements: For he
may pretend he did it unwillingly, and get his friends to declare that he
privately signified that to them. And for that argument, which was taken from
the want of Consummation; they had forgotten what was pleaded on the Kings
behalf 10 years before, That consent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Consummation, made a Marriage
compleat; by which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that though Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> had not
Consummated his Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with Queen <hi>Katherine</hi>; yet his consent did so
complete it, that the King could not afterwards lawfully marry her. But as the
King was resolved on any terms, to be rid of this Queen; so the Clergy were
also resolved not to incur his displeasure: In which they rather sought for
reasons to give some colour to their Sentence, than past their judgment upon
the strength of them. This only can be said for their excuse, that these were
as just and weighty reasons, as used to be admitted by the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> for a Divorce; and most of them being Canonists, and knowing how
many Precedents there were to be found for such Divorces, they thought they
might do it as well as the Popes had formerly done.</p>
            <p>On the 9th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> Sentence was given: Which was signed
by both Houses of Convocation, and had the two Arch-bishops Seals put to it; of
which whole Tryal the Record does yet remain, having esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Fate of the
other Books of Convocation. The Original depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions are also yet extant.</p>
            <p>Only I shall add here a reflection upon <hi>Cromwels</hi>
misfortune, which may justly abate the loftiness of haughty men. The day after
he was attainted, being required to send to the King a full account under his
hand of the business of his Marriage; which Account he sent,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 17.</note> as will be found in the
Collection; he Concludes it with these abject words: 
<q>I a most woful Prisoner, ready to take the death, when it shall
  please God and your Majesty: and yet the frail flesh inciteth me continually to
  call to your Grace for Mercy, and Grace for mine offences. And thus Christ
  save, preserve, and keep you. Written at the <hi>Tower</hi> this Wednesday the
  last of <hi>Iune,</hi> with the heavy heart, and trembling hand, of your
  Highness most heavy, and most miserable Prisoner, and poor slave, <hi>Thomas
  Cromwel.</hi> 
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:104314:166"/> And a little below that,<note place="margin">1529.</note> 
                  <hi>Most Gracious Prince, I cry for Mercy, Mercy,
  Mercy.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>On the 10th of <hi>Iuly</hi> the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> reported to the House of Lords,<note place="margin">Report
  made to the Parl.</note> That the Convocation had judged the Marriage Null,
both by the Law of God, and the Law of the Land. The Bishop of
<hi>Winchester</hi> delivered the Judgment in Writing; which being read, he
enlarged on all the reasons of it. This satisfied the Lords, and they sent down
<hi>Cranmer</hi> and him to the Commons, to give them the same account. Next
day the King sent the Lord Chancellor, the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Earl
of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> to let the
Queen know what was done: who was not at all troubled at it, and seemed not ill
pleased. They told her, that the King would by Letters Patents Declare her his
Adopted Sister, and give her prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before all the Ladies of
<hi>England,</hi> next his Queen and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and assign her an Estate of
3000 <hi>lib.</hi> a year; and that she had her choice either to live in
<hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Queen consents to it.</note> or to
return home again. She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the offer and under her hand declared her
consent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sentence; and chose to live still in
<hi>England</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where she was in great honour, rather than return under
that disgrace to her own Countrey. She was also desired to write to her
Brother, and let him know, that she approved of what was done in her matter,
and that the King used her as a Father, or a Brother; and therefore to desire
him and her other friends not to take this matter ill, or lessen their
friendship to the King. She had no mind to do that, but said, it would be time
enough when her Brother wrote to her, to send him such an answer. But it was
answered, That much depended on the first Impressions that are received of any
matter. She in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion said, she would obey the King in every thing he
desired her to do.<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.</note> So she
wrote the Letter as they desired it; and the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being the 12th of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> the Bill was brought into the House, for annulling the Marriage,
which went easily through both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>On the 16th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> a Bill was brought in, for
moderating the Statute of the six Articles in the Clauses that related to the
marriage of the Priests,<note place="margin">An Act about the Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of
  Priests.</note> or their Incontinency with other Women. On the 17th, it was
agreed by the whole House without a contradictory vote, and sent down to the
Commons; who on the 21th, sent it up again. By it the pains of Death were
turned to forfeitures of their Goods and Chattels, and the rents of their
Ecclesiastical promotions, to the King.</p>
            <p>On the 20th of <hi>Iuly</hi> a Bill was brought in concerning a
Declaration of the Christian Religion,<note place="margin">Another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
  Religion.</note> and was then read the first, 2d, and 3d, time, and passed
without any opposition, and sent down to the Commons, who agreeing to it, sent
it up again the next day. 
<q>It contained, that the King as Supream Head of the Church, was
  taking much pains for an Union among all his Subjects in matters of Religion:
  and for preventing the further progress of Heresie, had appointed many of the
  Bishops and the most learned Divines, to declare the principal Articles of the
  Christian Belief, with the Ceremonies, and way of Gods service to be observed.
  That therefore a thing of that weight might not be rashly done, or hasted
  through, in this Session of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; <pb n="283" facs="tcp:104314:166"/> but be done
  with that care which was requisite;<note place="margin">1540.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
  it was Enacted, that whatsoever was determined by the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Bishops,
  and the other Divines, now Commissionated for that effect, or by any others
  appointed by the King, or by the whole Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> and
  published by the Kings Authority concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Christian Faith, or the
  Ceremonies of the Church, should be believed and obeyed by all the Kings
  Subjects; as well as if the particulars so set forth had been ennumerated in
  this Act, any Custom or Law to the Contrary notwithstanding. To this, a strange
  Proviso was added, which destroyed the former Clause; That nothing should be
  done or determined by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Act, which was contrary to the
  Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom.</q> But whether this Proviso was added by the
House of Commons, or originally put into the Bill, does not appear. It was more
likely it was put in at the first by the Kings Council: for these contradictory
Clauses raised the Prerogative higher, and left it in the Judges power to
determine which of the two should be followed; by which all Ecclesiastical
matters were to be brought under Tryals at Common Law: for it was one of the
great designs, both of the Ministers and Lawyers at this time, to bring all
Ecclesiastical Matters to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Cognizance of the Secular Judge.</p>
            <p>But another Bill passed, which seems a little odd, concerning the
circumstances of that time. 
<q>That whereas many Marriages had been annulled in the time of
  Popery, upon the pretence of Precontracts, or other degrees of kindred, than
  those that were prohibited by the Law of God: Therefore, after a Marriage was
  consummated, no pretence of any pre-contract, or any degrees of kindred or
  alliance, but those mentioned in the Law of God, should be brought or made use
  of, to annull it; since these things had been oft pretended, only to dissolve a
  Marriage, when the parties grew weary of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was contrary to
  Gods Law. Therefore it was Enacted that no pretence of precontract, not
  consummated, should be made use of to annull a Marriage duly solemnized, and
  consummated; and that no degrees of kindred, not mentioned by the Law of God,
  should be pleaded to annull a Marriage.</q> This Act gave great occasion of
censuring the Kings former proceedings against Queen <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi>
since that which was now condemned had been the pretence for dissolving his
Marriage with her. Others thought the King did it on design to remove that
Impediment out of the way of the Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s succeeding to the
Crown; since that judgment upon which she was Illegitimated, was now indirectly
censured: And that other branch of the Act, for taking away all prohibitions of
Marriages, within any degrees but those forbidden in Scripture, was to make way
for the Kings Marriage with <hi>Katherine Howard,</hi> who was Cousin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to Queen <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi>; for that was one of the prohibited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees by
the Canon Law.</p>
            <p>The Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> offered a Subsidy of four
shillings in the pound, of all Ecclesiastical preferments, to be payed in two
years,<note place="margin">Subsidies granted by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the great charges of the King had been at, and was still to 
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:104314:167"/> be at, in building Havens, Bullwarks, and other Forts,
for the defence of his Coasts, and the security of his Subjects. This was
confirmed in Parliament. But that did not satisfie the King; who had husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the money that came in by the sale of Abbey Lands, so ill, that now he wanted
money, and was forced to aske a subsidy for his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Parliament:
this was obtained with great difficulty. For it was said,<note place="margin">And
  Laiety.</note> That if the King was already in want, after so vast an income,
especially being engaged in no Warr, there would be no end of his necessities;
nor could it be possible for them to supply them. But it was answered, that the
King had laid out a great Treasure in forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Coast: and though he was
then in no visible Warr, yet the charge he was at in keeping up the Warr beyond
Sea, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the expence of a Warr; and much more to the advantage of his
people, who were kept in peace and plenty. This obtained a Tenth, and four
15ths. After the passing of all these Bills, and many others that concerned the
publick, with several other Bills of Attaindor, of some that favoured the Popes
Interests, or Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi>; which shall be
mentioned in another place, the King sent in a General Pardon, with the
Ordinary Exceptions; and in particular, excepted <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the Countess
of <hi>Sarum,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, then in person; Some of them were put in
for oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Kings Supremacy, and others for transgressing the Statute of
the six Articles; On the 24th of <hi>Iuly</hi> the Parliament was
dissolved.</p>

                     </gap>s</hi> Death.</note>And now <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who had
been six weeks a Prisoner, was brought to his Execution. He had used all the
endeavours he could for his own preservation. Once he wrote to the King in such
melting terms, that he made the Letter to be thrice read, and seemed tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with it. But the charms of <hi>Katharine Howard,</hi> and the endeavours of the
Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> at length
prevailed. So a Warrant was sent to cut off his Head, on the 28th of
<hi>Iuly</hi> at <hi>Tower-hill.</hi> 
               <q>When he was brought to the Scaffold, his kindness to his Son
  made him very cautious in what he said; he declined the purging of himself, but
  said, he was by Law condemned to die, and thanked God for bringing him to that
  death, for his offences. He acknowledged his Sins against God, and his offences
  against his Prince, who had raised him from a base degree. He declared that he
  died in the Catholick Faith, not doubting of any Article of Faith, or of any
  Sacrament of the Church: and denied that he had been a Supporter of those who
  believed ill opinions: He confessed he had been seduced, but now died in the
  Catholick Faith, and desired them to pray for the King, and for the Prince, and
  for himself: and then prayed very fervently for the remission of his past sins,
  and admittance into Eternal Glory: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given the Sign, the Executioner
  cut off his Head very bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note>Thus fell that great
Minister, that was raised meerly upon the strength of his natural parts. For as
his Extraction was mean, so his Education was low: All the learning he had,
was, that he had got the new-Testament in Latine by heart. His great wisdom,
and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity in business, raised him up through several steps, till he was
become as great as a Subject could be. He carryed his greatness with 
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:104314:167"/> wonderful temper and moderation; and fell under the
weight of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular <hi>Odium,</hi> rather than Guilt. The disorders in the
Suppression of Abbeys were generally charged on him. Yet when he fell, no
Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor cheating of the King, could be fastned on him; though such things
came out in swarms on a disgraced Favourite, when there is any ground for them.
By what he spoke at his death, he left it much doubted of what Religion he
dyed. But it is certain he was a <hi>Lutheran.</hi> The term
<hi>Catholick-Faith</hi> used by him in his last speech seemed to make it
doubtful, but that was then used in <hi>England,</hi> in its true sense, in
Opposition to the Novelties of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as will afterwards
appear, on another occasion. So that his Profession of the Catholich-Faith was
strangely perverted, when some from thence Concluded that he dyed in the
Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But his praying in <hi>English,</hi>
and that only to God through Christ, without any of these tricks that were used
when those of that Church died, shewed he was none of theirs, With him the
Office of the Kings Vice-gerent in Ecclesiastical affairs died, as it rose
first in his person: and as all the Clergy opposed the seting up a new Officer,
whose Interest should oblige him to oppose a Reconciliation with <hi>Rome,</hi>
so it seems none were fond to succeed in an Office, that proved so fatal to him
that had first carryed it. The King was said to have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his death, after
it was too late; but the fall of the new Queen, that followed not long after,
and the miseries which fell also on the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and his
Family, some years after, were looked on as the Scourges of Heaven, for their
cruel prosecution of this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Minister.</p>
            <p>With his fall, the progress of the Reformation, which had been by
his endeavours so far advanced, was quite stopt. For all that <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
could do after this, was to keep the ground they had gained. But he could never
advance much further.<note place="margin">Designs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
  <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
               </note> And indeed every one expected to see him go next.
For, as one <hi>Gostwick</hi> Knight for <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire,</hi> had named him
in the House of Commons, as the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter and Promoter of all the Heresie that
was in <hi>England</hi>; so the Popish party reckoned they had but half done
their work, by destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Cromwel</hi>; and that it was not finished till
<hi>Cranmer</hi> followed him. Therefore all possible endeavors were used to
make discoveries of the Encouragement, which, as was believed he gave to the
Preachers of the condemned Doctrines. And it is very probable, that had not the
Incontinence of <hi>Katherine Howard</hi> (whom the King declared Queen on the
8th of <hi>August,</hi>) broken out not long after, he had been Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed the
next Session of Parliament.</p>
            <p>But now I return to my proper business, to give an account of
Church-matters for this year; with which these great Changes in Court had so
great a Relation, that the Reader will excuse the digression about them.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Cromwels</hi> fall, <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and those that
followed him, made no doubt but they should quickly recover what they had lost
of late years. So their greatest attempt was upon the Translation of the
Scriptures. The Convocation Books (as I have been forced often to lament,) are
lost; so that here I cannot stir, but as <hi>Fuller</hi> leads me: who assures
the World that he Copied out of the Records with his <pb n="286" facs="tcp:104314:168"/> own
Pen what he published. And yet I doubt he has mistaken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the year;
and that which he calls the Convocation of this year, was the Convocation of
the year 1542. For he tells us that their 7th Session was the 10th of
<hi>March.</hi> Now in this year the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation did not sit down till the
13th of <hi>April,</hi> but that year it sate all <hi>March.</hi> So likewise
he tells us of the Bishops of <hi>Westminster, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> and
<hi>Peterborough,</hi> bearing a share in this Convocation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as these were
not Consecrated before Winter, and could not sit as Bishops in this Synod. And
besides, <hi>Thirleby</hi> sate at this time in the lower House; as was
formerly shewn in the Process about <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleves</hi> Marriage.
So that their attempt against the new Testament belongs to the year 1542.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sits about Religion.</note>But
they were now much better employed, though not in the way of Convocation. For a
select number of them sate by vertue of a Commission from the King confirmed in
Parliament. Their first work was to draw up a Declaration of the Christian
Doctrine, <hi>for the necessary erudition of a Christian man.</hi> They thought
that to speak of Faith in general, ought naturally to go before an Exposition
of the Christian Belief; and therefore with that they began.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that designed to keep her Children in
ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,<note place="margin">An Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith.</note> had made no
great account of Faith: which they generally taught, consisted chiefly in an
Implicite Believing whatever the Church proposed; without any explicite
knowledg of particulars. So that a Christian Faith, as they had explained it,
was a Submission to the Church. The Reformers finding that this was the Spring
of all their other errors, and that which gave them colour and Authority; did
on the other hand set up the strength of their whole Cause on an Explicite
believing the truth of the Scriptures, because of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, who
had revealed them. And said, that as the great Subject of the Apostles
Preaching, was <hi>Faith,</hi> so that which they every-where taught, was to
read and believe the Scriptures. Upon which followed nice Disputing, what was
that saving Faith by which the Scriptures say <hi>we are Iustified.</hi> They
could not say it was bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crediting the Divine Revelation, since in that
sense the Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. Therefore they generally placed it, at first, in
their being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that they should be saved by Christs dying for them. In
which, their design was to make Holiness and all other Graces neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
requisites in the Composition of Faith; though they would not make them
formally parts of it. For since Christs death has its full vertue and effect
upon none but those who are regenerate, and live according to his Gospel; none
could be assured that he should be sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christs death, till he first found
in himself these necessary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications which are delivered in the Gospel.
Having once setled on this phrase, their followers would needs defend it, but
really made it worse by their Explanations. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thought
they had them at great advantages in it, and called them <hi>Solifidians,</hi>
and said they were against good works: though whatever unwary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions some
of them threw out, they always declared good works indispensably necessary to
Salvation. But they differed from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in two things
that were material: There was also a third, but there the difference was more
in the manner of expression. The <pb n="287" facs="tcp:104314:168"/> one was, what were good
works. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally delivered, that works which
did an immediate honour to God or his Saints, were more valuable, than works
done to other men: and that the honour they did to Saints in their Images, and
Relicks, and to God in his Priests, that were dedicated to him, were the
high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pieces of Holiness: as having the best Objects. This was the
foundation of all that Trade, which brought in both Riches and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their
Church. On the other hand, the Reformers taught that justice and mercy, with
other good works done in obedience to Gods Commandments, were only necessary.
And for these things so much magnified at <hi>Rome,</hi> they acknowledged
there ought to be a decent splendor in the worship of God: and good provision
to be made for the encouragement of those who dedicated themselves to his
Service in the Church: and that what was beyond these, was the effect of
Ignorance and Superstition. The other main difference was about the Merit of
good works: which the Friars had raised so high, that people were come to think
they bought and sold with Almighty God, for Heaven, and all other his
blessings. This the Reformers judged was the height of Arrogance: And therefore
taught that good works were indeed absolutely necessary to Salvation: but that
the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of Heaven was only by the Death and Intercession of Jesus Christ.
With these material differences they joyned another that consisted more in
words. Whether Obedience was an essential part of Faith. The Reformers said it
certainly accompanyed and followed Faith: but thought not fit to make it an
Ingredient in the nature of Faith. These things had been now much canvassed in
disputes: And it was thought by many, that men of ill lives made no good use of
some of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the Reformers, that separated Faith from good
works, and came to perswade themselves, that if they could but attain to a firm
assurance, That they should be saved by Christ, all would be well with them.
Therefore now when they went about to state the true Notion of Faith,
<hi>Cranmer</hi> commanded Doctor <hi>Redmayn,</hi> who was esteemed the most
learned and judicious Divine of that time, to write a short Treatise on these
Heads: which he did with that solidity and clearness, that it will sufficiently
justifie any advantagious Character that can be given of the Author; and
according to the Conclusions of that Treatise they laid down the nature of
Faith, thus: That it stands in two several senses in Scripture, 
<q>The one is a perswasion of the truths, both of natural and
  revealed Religion, wrought in the mind by Gods holy Spirit: And the other is
  such a belief as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a submission to the will of God, and hath Hope, Love,
  and Obedience to Gods Commandments joyned to it: which was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
  Faith, and that which according to St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrought by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and
  was so much commended in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> That this was the
  Faith which in Baptism is professed, from which Christians are called the
  <hi>Faithful</hi>: And in those Scriptures where it is said, That we are
  justified by Faith, they declared, we may not think that we be justified by
  Faith, as it is a separate vertue from Hope and Charity, Fear of God, and
  Repentance; but by it is meant Faith, neither only, nor alone, but with the
  foresaid vertues coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together; containing (as is aforesaid) the Obedience
  to the <pb n="288" facs="tcp:104314:169"/> whole Doctrine and Religion of Christ.<note place="margin">1539.</note> But for the Definition of Faith, which some proposed,
  as if it were a certainty that one was Predestinated, they found nothing of it,
  either in the Scriptures, or the Doctors: and thought that could not be known:
  for though God never failed in his Promises to men, yet such was the frailty of
  men, that they often failed in their promises to God, and so did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their
  right to the promises, which are all made upon conditions that depend on
  us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this occasion I shall digress a little, to show with what
care <hi>Cranmer</hi> considered so weighty a point.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cranmers</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion about it.</note> Among his other
Papers, I find a Collection of a great many places out of the Scripture,
concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Justification by Faith, together with a vast number of Quotations,
out of <hi>Origen, Basil, Ierome, Theodoret, Ambrose, Austin, Prosper,
Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom, Gennadius, Beda, Hesychins, Theophylact,</hi> and
<hi>Oecumenius</hi>; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many later writers, such as <hi>Anselm,
Bernard, Peter Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, Hugo Cardinalis, Lyranus,</hi> and <hi>Bruno</hi>; in
which the sense of those Authors in this Point did appear; all drawn out with
his own hand. To this is added another Collection of many places of the
Fathers, in which they speak of the <hi>merit of good works</hi>: and at the
end of the whole Collection he writes these words, 
<q>This Proposition that we be justified by Christ only, and not by
  our good works; is a very true and necessary Doctrine of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi>
  and the other Apostles, taught by them, to set forth thereby the Glory of
  Christ, and the Mercy of God through Christ.</q>And after some further
discourse to the same purpose, he concludes, 
<q>although all that be justified must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have Charity,
  as well as Faith; yet neither Faith nor Charity be the worthiness nor merits of
  our Justification: but that is to be ascribed only to our Saviour Christ: who
  was offered upon the cross for our sins, and rose again for our
  Justification.</q> This I set down to let the World see that <hi>Cranmer</hi>
was not at all concerned in those ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties, which have been so much enquired
into since that time, about the instrumentality of Faith, in Justification; all
that he then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, being that the glory of it might be ascribed only to
the Death and Intercession of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Creed.</note>After
this was thus laid down, there followed an Explanation of the Apostles Creed;
full of excellent matters; being a large Paraphrase on every Article of the
Creed, with such serious and practical Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that I must acknowledg,
after all the practical Books we have had, I find great Edification in reading
that over and over again. The Style is strong, nervous, and well-fitted for the
weakest capacities. There is nothing in this that is controverted between the
Papists and the Reformers; except the Definition of <hi>the Holy Catholick
Church,</hi> which they give thus. <hi>That it comprehends all Assemblies of
men over the whole World, that receive the Faith of Christ: who ought to hold
an unity of Love, and Brotherly agreement together, by which they become
members of the Catholick Church.</hi> Upon which a long excursion is made, to
shew the unjustice and unreasonableness of the plea of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi>; who place the unity of the Catholick Church, in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to
the Bishop of their City; without any ground from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the Ancient
writers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:104314:169"/>From that they proceeded to Examine the
seven Sacraments:<note place="margin">1540.</note> And here fell in stiff
debates, which remain in some Authentick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that give a great light to
their proceedings.<note place="margin">The seven Sacraments.</note> The method
which they followed was this. First, the whole business they were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
was divided into so many heads; which were proposed as Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and these were
given out to so many Bishops and Divines: And at a prefixed time every one
brought his opinion in writing, upon all the Queries. So concerning the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ven Sacraments, the Queries were given
out to the two Arch-Bishops, the Bishops of <hi>London, Rochester,</hi> and
<hi>Carlisle,</hi> (though the last was not in the Commission,) And to the
Bishops of <hi>Duresm, Hereford,</hi> and St. <hi>Davids.</hi>
               <note place="margin">With grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
  maturity.</note> For though the Bishop of <hi>Winch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ster</hi> was in this Commission, yet
he did nothing in this particular; but I Imagine that he was gone out of Town,
and that the Bishop of <hi>Carlisle</hi> was appointed to supply his absence.
The Queries were also given to Doctor <hi>Thirleby,</hi> then Bishop Elect of
<hi>Westminster,</hi> to Doctor <hi>Robertson, Day, Redmayn, Cox,
Leighton,</hi> (though not in the Commission) <hi>Symmonds, Tresham,
Coren,</hi> (though not in the Commission,) <hi>Edgeworth, Oglethorp, Crayford,
Wilson,</hi> and <hi>Robins.</hi> When their answers were given in, two were
appointed to compare them, and draw an Extract of the particulars, in which
they agreed or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed: which the one did in <hi>Latine,</hi> and the other
in <hi>English</hi>; only those who compared them, it seems, doing it for the
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> took no notice of his Opinions in the
Extract they made. And of these, the Original answers of the two Arch-Bishops,
the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>London, Rochester,</hi> and <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and these
Doctors, <hi>Day, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertson, Redmayn, Cox, Leighton, Symmonds, Tresham, Coren,
Edgeworth,</hi> and <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> are yet extant. But the Papers given in
by the Bishops of <hi>Duresm, Hereford,</hi> and St. <hi>Davids,</hi> and the
Elect of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and Doctors, <hi>Crayford, Wilson,</hi> and
<hi>Robins,</hi> though they are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Extracts made out of them,
yet are lost.<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.</note> This the
Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will find in the Collection; which, though it be somewhat large, yet I
thought such pieces were of too great Importance, not to be communicated to the
World; since it is perhaps as great an Evidence of the ripeness of their
proceedings, as can be shewed in any Church, or any Age of it. And though other
Papers of this sort do not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in this Kings Reign; yet I have reason to
conclude from this Instance, that they proceeded with the same maturity in the
rest of their deliberations. In which I am the more confirmed, because I find
another instance like this, in the Reformation that was further carried on in
the succeeding Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th; of many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Divines
giving in their opinions under their hands, upon some heads then examined and
changed. In <hi>Cranmers</hi> Paper some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular opinions of his about the
nature of Ecclesiastical Offices will be found; but as they are delivered by
him with all possible modesty, so they were not established as the Doctrine of
the Church, but laid aside as particular conceits of his own, and it seems that
afterwards he changed his opinion. For he Subscribed the Book that was soon
after set out; which is directly contrary to those opinions set down in these
Papers. <hi>Cranmer</hi> was for reducing the Sacraments to two, but the Popish
party was then prevalent, so the old number of seven wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> agreed to.</p>

               <note place="margin">1539.</note>Baptism was
explained in the same manner that had been done three years before, in the
Articles then set out: only the matter of Original Sin was more enlarged
on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Pennance was formally placed in the absolution
of the Priest; which by the former Articles was only declared a thing
desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and not to be contemned if it might be had; yet all merit of good
works was rejected, though they were declared necessary: and sinners were
taught to depend wholly on the Sufferings of Christ; with other good directions
about Repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the Explanation of the Eucharist,
Transubstantiation was fully asserted: as also the Concomitancy of the Blood
with the Flesh; so that Communion in both kinds was not necessary. The use of
hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mass, though one did not Communicate, was also asserted. To which were
added ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> good Rules about the
disposition of mind that ought to accompany this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Matrimony was said to be Instituted of God, and
San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Christ: The degrees in the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law were declared
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory, and none else: and the Bond of Marriage was declared not separable
on any account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Orders were to be administred in the Church,
according to the New-Testament: but the particular forms, of Nominating,
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, Presenting, or appointing Ecclesiastical Ministers, was left to the
Laws of every Countrey, to be made by the assent of the Prince. The Office of
Church-men was to Preach, Administer the Sacraments, to bind and loose, and to
pray for the whole Flock: But they must execute these, with such limitation as
was allowed by the Laws of every Kingdom. The Scripture, they said, made
express mention on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the two Orders of Priests and Deacons. To these the
Primitive Church had added some Inferior degrees, which were also not to be
contemned. But no Bishop had any Authority over other Bishops by the Law of
God. Upon which followed a long Digression, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the pretensions of the
Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi>; with an Explanation of the Kings Authority in
Ecclesiastical matters; which was before hand set down in another place, to
shew what they understood by the Kings being <hi>Supream Head of the
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Confirmation was said to have been used in the
Primitive Church, in Imitation of the Apostles; who by laying on their hands
conferred the Holy-Ghost, in an extraordinary manner. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was of
great advantage, but not necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Extream-unction was said to have been derived
from the practice of the Apostles, mentioned by St. <hi>Iames,</hi> for the
health both of Body, and Soul: And though the sick person was not always
recovered of his bodily sickness by it, yet remission of sins was obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by
it; and that which God knew to be best for our bodily condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to whose will
we ought always to submit. But this Sacrament was only fruitful to those who by
pennance were restored to the State of Grace.</p>
            <p>Then followed an Explanation of the Ten Commandements, which
contains many good rules of Morality,<note place="margin">The ten
  Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> drawn from every one of them. The 2d Commandment
<hi>Gardiner</hi> had a minde to have shortned, and to cast it into the first.
<hi>Cranmer</hi> was for setting it down as it was in <pb n="291" facs="tcp:104314:170"/>
the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> But a temper was found:<note place="margin">1540.</note> it was placed as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Commandment, but not at
full length; the words, <hi>For I the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. being left
out, and only those that go before being set down. In the Explanation of this
Commandment, Images were said to be profitable for putting us in mind of the
great blessings we have received by our Saviour, and of the vertues and
holiness of the Saints, by which we were to be stirred up to imitate them: So
that they were not to be despised, though we be forbidden to do any god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honour to them. And therefore the Superstition of preferring one Image to
another, as if they had any special vertue in them, or the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning them
richly, and making Vowes and Pilgrimages to them, is condemned; yet the Censing
of Images, and Kneeling before them, are not condmned: but the people must be
taught, that these things were not to be done to the Image it self, but to God
and his honour. To the third Commandment, they reduced the Invocation of Gods
name for his Gifts. And they condemned the Invocation of Saints, when such
things were prayed for from them, which were only given by God. This was the
giving his Glory to Creatures: yet to pray to Saints as Intercessors is
declared lawful, and according to the Doctrine of the Catholick Church. Upon
the 4th Commandement a Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t from
labour every 7th day is said to be Ceremonial, and such as only obliged
<hi>Iews</hi>: but the Spiritual signification of Rest among Christians, was to
abstain from Sin, and other Carnal pleasures. But besides that, we were also
bound by this Precept sometimes to cease from labour, that we may serve and
worship God both in publick and private: And that on the dayes appointed for
this purpose, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to examine their lives, the past week, and set to
amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and give themselves to prayer, reading, and meditation. Yet in
cases of necessity, such as saving their Corn, or Cattel, men ought not
superstitiously to think that it is a Sin to work on that day; but to do their
work without scruple. Then follow very profitable Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the other
Commandments, with many grave and weighty admonitions concerning the duties by
them enjoyned, and against those sins which are too Common in all Ages.</p>
            <p>After that, an Explanation of the Lords Prayer was added.<note place="margin">The Lords Prayer.</note> In the preface to which, it is said, that
it is meet and requisite that the unlearned people should make their Prayers in
their Mother-Tongue; whereby they may be the more stirred to Devotion, and to
mind the things they prayed for. Then followed an Exposition of the Angels
Salutation of the Blessed Virgin: In which, the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the
Incarnation of Christ was opened, and the <hi>Ave Maria</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; which
Hymne was chiefly to be used,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
               </note>
in Commemoration of Christs Incarnation, and likewise to set forth the praises
of the Blessed Virgin. The next article is about Free-will, which they say must
be in man, otherwise all Precepts and Exhortations are to no purpose. They
defined it <hi>a power of the will, joyned with Reason, whereby a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
creature, without constraint, in things of reason,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Free-will.</note> 
               <hi>discerneth and willeth good and evil; but
chooseth good by the assistance of Gods grace and evil of it self.</hi> This
was perfect in the State of Innocency, but is much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by <hi>Adams</hi>
Fall, and now by an especial grace (offered to all men, but enjoyed only by
those who by their free-will do accept the same,) <pb n="292" facs="tcp:104314:171"/> it was
restored, that with great watchfulness we may serve God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably. And as
many places of Scripture shew, That free-will is still in man, so there be many
others which shew that the grace of God is necessary, that doth both prevent
us, and assist us, both to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and perform every good work. Therefore all
men ought most gratefully to receive and follow the motions of the Holy Ghost,
and to beg Gods grace with earnest devotion, and a stedfast Faith: which he
will grant to all that so ask it, both because he is naturally good, and he has
promised to grant our desires. For he is not the author of Sin, nor the Cause
of mans Damnation; but this men draw on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who by vice have corrupted
these Natures which God made good. Therefore all Preachers were warned so to
moderate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this high point, that they neither should so preach the
Grace of God as to take away Free-will, nor so extol Free-will, as injury might
be done to the Grace of God.</p>
            <p>After this they handled Justification. Having stated the miseries
of man by nature,<note place="margin">Justification.</note> and the guilt of Sin,
with the unspeakable goodness of God in sending Christ to redeem us by his
death, who was the Mediator between God and man; They next shew how men are
made partakers of the blessings which he hath procured. Justification is the
making of us righteous before God, whereby we are reconciled to him, and made
heirs of Eternal life: that by his Grace we may walk in his ways, and be
reputed just and righteous in the day of Judgment, and so attain Everlasting
Happiness. God is the chief cause of our Justification: yet man prevented by
Grace is by his free-consent and obedience a worker toward the attaining his
own Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For though it is only procur'd through the merits of
Christs death, yet every one must do many things to attain a right and claim to
that which, though it was offered to all, yet was applied but to a few. We must
have a stedfast Faith, true Repentance, real purposes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; committing
Sin no more, but serving God all our lives; which if we fall from, we must
recover it, by Penance, Fasting, Almes, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with other good works, and a
firm Faith, going forward in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and obedience to the Laws of God:
It being certain that men might fall away from their Justification. All curious
reasonings about Predestination were to be set apart; there being no certainty
to he had of our Election, but by feeling the motions of Gods Spirit in us, by
a good and virtuous life, and persevering in it to the end. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was
to be taught, that as on the one hand we are justified freely by the free Grace
of God, so on the other hand, when it is said <hi>We are justified by
Faith,</hi> it must be understood of such a Faith, in which the fear of God,
Repentance, Hope, and Charity, be included, all which must be joyned together
in our Justification: and though these be imperfect, yet God accepteth of them
freely thorough Christ.</p>
            <p>Next, good works were explained, which were said to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to Salvation.<note place="margin">Good Works.</note> But these were not
only outward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral works, but inward Spiritual works, as the Love and Fear
of God, Patience, Humility, and the like. Nor were they Superstitions, and mens
Inventions, such as those in which Monks and Friers exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised themselves: nor
only moral works done by the power of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <pb n="293" facs="tcp:104314:171"/> reason:
but the works of Charity, flowing from a pure heart, a good Conscience, and
Faith unfeigned; which were meritorious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the attaining of Everlasting
life. Other works were of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior sort; such as Fasting, Almsdeeds, and
other fruits of Penance. And the merit of good works is reconciled with the
freedom of Gods mercies to us, since all our works are done by his Grace; so
that we have no cause of boasting, but must ascribe all to the Grace and
goodness of God. The last Chapter is about Prayers for Souls depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which
is the same that was formerly set out in the Articles three years before.</p>
            <p>All this was finished and set forth this year,<note place="margin">All this set forth in a Book,</note> with a Preface writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by
those of the Clergy who had been imployed in it: declaring with what care they
had examined the Scriptures, and the ancient Doctors, out of whom they had
faithfully gathered this Exposition of the Christian Faith. To this the King
added another Preface some years after,<note place="margin">And publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the
  Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> declaring that although he had cast out the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by setting forth the Scriptures to his people, which had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced very good
effects; yet, as hypocrisie and superstition were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged away, so a Spirit of
presumption, dissension, and carnal liberty was breaking in. For repressing
which he had by the advice of his Clergy, set forth a Declaration of the true
knowledg of God, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting all mens belief and practice; which both Houses
of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had seen, and liked very well. So that he verily trusted it
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a true and sufficient Doctrine, for the attaining everlasting life.
Therefore he required all his people, to read and print in their hearts, the
Doctrine of this Book. He also willed them to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that as there were
some Teachers, whose Office it was to instruct the people; so the rest ought to
be taught, and to those it was not necessary to read the Scriptures: and that
therefore he had restrained it from a great many, esteeming it sufficient for
such to hear the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Scriptures taught by their Preachers, which
they should lay up in their hearts, and practise in their lives. Lastly, he
desired all his Subjects to pray to God to grant them the Spirit of Humility,
that they might read and carry in their hearts the Doctrine set forth in this
Book. But though I have joyned the account of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, to the Extract
here made of the Bishops Book, yet it was not prefixed to it, till above two
years after the other was set out.</p>
            <p>When this was published,<note place="margin">It is variously
  censured.</note> both parties found cause in it both to be glad and sorrowful.
The Reformers rejoyced to see the Doctrine of the Gospel thus opened more and
more; for they concluded that Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and prejudices, being the chief
supports of the Errours they complained of; the instructing people in Divine
Matters, even though some particulars displeased them, yet would awaken and
work upon an inquisitive humour that was then a-stirring; and they did not
doubt but their Doctrines were so clear, that Inquiries into Religion would do
their business. They were also glad to see the Morals of Christianity so well
cleared, which they hoped would dispose people to a better taste of Divine
matters; since they had observed that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Soul does mightily prepare
people for sound opinions. Most of the Superstitious conceits and practices,
which had for some ages em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based <pb n="294" facs="tcp:104314:172"/> the Christian Faith,
were now removed; and the great funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of Christianity, the Covenant
between God and man in Christ, with the conditions of it, was plainly and
sincerely declared. There was also another principle laid down, that was big
with a further Reformation: for every National Church was declared a compleat
Body within it self, with power to reform heresies, correct abuses, and do
every thing else that was necessary for keeping it self pure, or governing its
members. By which there was a fair way opened for a full discussion of things
afterwards, when a fitter opportunity should be offered. But on the other hand,
the Popish party thought they had gained much. The seven Sacraments were again
asserted, so that here much ground was recovered, and they hoped more would
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. There were many things laid down, to which they knew the Reformers
would never consent. So that they, who were resolved to comply with every thing
that the King had a mind to, were pretty safe. But the others, who followed
their perswasions and consciences were brought into many snares; and the Popish
party was confident that their absolute compliance, which was joyned with all
possible submission and flattery, would gain the King at length: and the
stiffness of others, who would not give that deference to the Kings judgment
and pleasure, would so alienate him from them, that he would in the end abandon
them; for with the Kings years his unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness and peevishness grew mightily on
him.</p>
            <p>The dissolution of the Kings Marriage with <hi>Anne</hi> of
<hi>Cleves,</hi> had so offended the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> that though
upon the Ladies account, they made no publick noise of it; yet there was little
more intercourse between the King and them, especially <hi>Cromwel</hi>
falling, that had alwayes carried on the correspondence with them. And as this
intercourse went off, so a secret Treaty was set on foot between the King and
the Emperor: yet it came not to a Conclusion till two years after.</p>

and so slight, that there was no need of reprinting, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Missals,
Breviaries, or other Offices; for a few rasures of these Collects in which the
Pope was prayed for, of <hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> Office, and the Offices of
other Saints, whose days were by the Kings Injunctions no more to be observed,
with some other Deletions, made, that the old Books did still serve. For
whether it was, that the Change of the Mass-Books, and other publick Offices,
would have been too great a Charge to the Nation; or whether they thought it
would have possessed the people with an opinion that the Religion was alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
since the Books of the ancient worship were changed; which remaining the same,
they might be the more easily perswaded, that the Religion was still the same;
there was no new impression of the Breviaries, Missals, and other Rituals,
during this Kings Reign. Yet in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time they took care that
Posterity should not know how much was dashed out or changed. For as all
Parishes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to furnish themselves with new compleat Books of the
Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; <pb n="295" facs="tcp:104314:172"/> so the dashed Books were every-where brought
in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. But it is likely that most of those Scandalous Hymnes and
Prayers, which are addressed to Saints in the same style, in which good
Christians worship God, were all struck out; because they were now condemned,
as appears from the Extract of the other Book set out by the Bishops.</p>
            <p>But as they went on in these things, the Popish party, whose
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels were laid very close, and managed with great dexterity,<note place="margin">A Persecution of Protestants.</note> chiefly by the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Gardin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r,</hi> pursued the ruine of those whom they called Hereticks:
knowing well that if the King was once set against them, and they provoked
against the Government, he would be not only alienated from them, but forced,
for securing himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, to gain the hearts of his other Subjects by
a Conjunction with the Emperor, and by his means with the Pope. The first on
whom this design took effect, were Doctor <hi>Barnes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gerard,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> all Priests; who had been among the earliest Converts
to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s Doctrine. <hi>Barnes</hi> had in a Sermon at
<hi>Cambridg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of <hi>Barnes</hi> and others.</note>
during the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals greatness, reflected on the Pomp and State in which he
lived, so plainly, that every body understood of whom he meant. So he was
carried up to <hi>London</hi>; but by the interposition of <hi>Gardiner</hi>
and <hi>Fox,</hi> who were his friends, he was saved at that time, having
abjured some opinions that were objected to him. But other accusations being
afterwards brought against him, he was again Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it was believed
that he would have been burnt. But he made his escape and went to
<hi>Germany,</hi> where he gave himself to the study of the Scriptures and
Divinity. In which he became so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that not only the
<hi>German</hi> Divines, but their Princes, took great notice of him: and the
King of <hi>Denmark</hi> sending over Ambass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dors to the King, he was sent with them; though perhaps
<hi>Fox</hi> was ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when he says he was one of them. <hi>Fox</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> being at <hi>Smalcald</hi> in the year 1536. sent
him over to <hi>England</hi>; where he was received and kindly entertained by
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> and well used by the King. And by his means the
correspondence with the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> was chiefly kept up. For he was often
sent over to the Courts of the several Princes. But in particular, he had the
misfortune to be first employed in the project of the Kings Marriage with the
Lady <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleves</hi>; for that giving the King so little
satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, all who were the main promoters of it fell in disgrace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
            <p>But other things concurred to destroy <hi>Barnes.</hi> In Lent
this year <hi>Bonner</hi> had appointed him and <hi>Gerrard,</hi> and
<hi>Ierome,</hi> turns in the Course of Sermons at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross:
they being in favour with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> on whom <hi>Bonner</hi> depended
wholly. But <hi>Gardiner</hi> sent <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> word, that he intended
himself to preach on Sunday at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross: and in his Sermon he
treated of Justification, and other points, with many reflections on the
<hi>Lutherans. Barnes,</hi> when it came to his Turn, made use of the same
Text, but preached contrary Doctrine; not without some unhandsome reflections
on <hi>Gardiners</hi> person; and he play<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed on his name, alluding to a
Gardiners setting ill Plants in a Garden. The other two preached the same
Doctrine, but made no reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on any person. <hi>Gardiner</hi> seemed to
bear it with a great appearance of <pb n="296" facs="tcp:104314:173"/> neglect and
indifferency. But his friends complained to the King of the unsufferable
insolencies of these Preachers, who did not spare so great a Prelate,
especially he being a Privy Councellor. So <hi>Barnes</hi> was questioned for
it, and commanded to go and give the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>
satisfaction. And the Bishop carried the matter with a great shew of
moderation, and acted ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wardly in
it, as became his Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: though it was believed the matter stuck deeper in
his heart, which the effects that followed seemed to demonstrate. The King
concerned himself in the matter, and did argue with <hi>Barnes</hi> about the
points in difference. But whether he was truly convinced, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rather
with the fear of the King than with the force of his reasonings; he and his two
Friends, <hi>William Ierome,</hi> and <hi>Tho. Gerrard,</hi> signed a
paper,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.</note> (which will be
found in the Collection,) in which he acknowledged, 
<q>That having been brought before the King, for things preached by
  him; His Highness, being assisted by some of the Clergy, had so disputed with
  him, that he was convinced of his rashness and oversight: and promised to
  abstain from such indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions for the future, and to submit to any orders
  the King should give for what was past.</q>
            </p>
            <q> 
               <p> The Articles were. <hi>First,</hi> That though we are Redeemed
only by the death of Christ, in which we participate by Faith and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; yet
by not following the Commandments of Christ we lose the benefits of it, which
we cannot recover but by Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That God is not the Author of Sin, or evil,
which he only permits.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That we ought to reconcile our selves to our
neighbours, and forgive, before we can be forgiven.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That good works, done sincerely according to
the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are profitable and helpful to Salvation.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That Laws made by Christian Rulers ought to be
obey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by their Subjects, for conscience sake: and that whosoever breaks them
breaks Gods Commandments.</p>
            </q>
            <p>It's not likely that <hi>Barnes</hi> could say any thing directly
contrary to these Articles: though having brought much of <hi>Luthers</hi> heat
over with him, he might have said some things that sounded ill upon these
heads. There were other points in difference between <hi>Gardiner</hi> and him,
about Justification; but it seems the King thought these were of so subtile a
nature, that no Article of Faith was controverted in them: and therefore left
the Bishop and him to agree these among themselves, which they in a great
measure did. So the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Barnes</hi> and his friends to preach
at the <hi>Spittle</hi> in the <hi>Easter</hi>-week, and openly to recant what
they had formerly said. And <hi>Barnes</hi> was in particular to ask the Bishop
of <hi>Winchester</hi>'s pardon, which he did: and <hi>Gardiner</hi> being
twice desired by him, to give some signe that he forgave him, did lift up his
Finger. But in their Sermons, it was said they justified in one part what they
recanted in another. Of which complaints being brought to the King, he, without
hearing them sent them all to the <hi>Tower.</hi> And <hi>Cromwels</hi>
interest at Court was then declining so fast, that either he could not protect
them, or else would not prejudice himself by interposing in a matter which gave
the King <pb n="297" facs="tcp:104314:173"/> so great offence. They lay in the Tower till
the Parliament met, and then they were attained of Heresie, without ever being
brought to make their answer.<note place="margin">Who were condemned in
  Parliament.</note> And it seems for the Extraordinariness of the thing, they
resolved to mix attaindors for things that were very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from one
Another. For four others were by the same Act at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of Treason, who were
<hi>Gregory Buttolph, Adam Damplip, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Brindholme,</hi> and <hi>Clement
Philpot,</hi> for assisting <hi>Reginald Pool,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> denying the King to be the Supream Head on earth of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and designing to surprize the Town of <hi>Callice.</hi>
One <hi>Derby Gunnings</hi> was also attainted of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for assisting one
<hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> a Traitor in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And after all these,
<hi>Barnes, Gerard,</hi> and <hi>Ierome,</hi> are attainted of Heresie, being,
as the Act sayes, 
<q>Detestable Hereticks, who had conspired together to set forth
  many Heresies, and taking themselves to be men of learning, had expounded the
  Scriptures; perverting them to their Heresies, the number of which was too long
  to be repeated; that having formerly abjured, they were now incorrigible
  Hereticks: and so were condemned to be burned, or suffer any other death; as
  should please the King.</q> And two dayes after <hi>Cromwels</hi> death, being
the 30th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> They were brought to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> where in
their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution there was as odd a mixture, as had been in their Attaindors.
For <hi>Abel Fetherston,</hi> and <hi>Powel,</hi> that were attainted by
another Act of the same Parliament, for owning the Popes Supremacy, and
deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings, were carried to the place of Execution, and coupled with
the other three. So that one of each was put into a Hurdle, and carried
together, which every body condemned as an Extravagant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of the shew
of Impartial Justice.</p>
            <p>When they were brought to the Stake,<note place="margin">Their
  Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at the Stake.</note> 
               <hi>Barnes</hi> spake thus to the People. 
<q>Since he was to be burned as an Heretick, he would declare what
  opinions he held. So he enlarged on all the Articles of the Creed, to shew he
  believed them all. He expressed a particular ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of an opinion which
  some Anabaptists held, That the Blessed Virgin was as a Saffron Bagg; (by which
  indecent <hi>Simile</hi> they meant that our Saviour took no substance of her.)
  He explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his opinion of Good works, that they must of necessity be done,
  since without them none should ever enter into the Kingdom of God. They were
  commanded of God, to shew forth our profession by them: but he believed, as
  they were not pure nor perfect, so they did not avail to our Justification, nor
  merit any thing at the hands of God; for that was to be ascribed to the Merits
  of the Death and Passion of Christ. He professed great Reverence to the Blessed
  Virgin and Saints. But said, he saw no warrant in Scriptures for praying to
  them: nor was it certain whether they prayed for us or not; but if the Saints
  did pray for those on Earth, he trusted within half an hour to be praying for
  them all.</q> Then he asked the Sheriff if he had any Articles against them,
for which they were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: who answered he had none. He next asked the
people, if they knew wherefore he died, or if they had been led into any
Errours by his Preaching; but none made answer. Then he said, he heard he was
condemned to die by an Act of Parliament; and it seemed it was for Heresie,
since they were to be burnt. He prayed God to forgive <pb n="298" facs="tcp:104314:174"/>
those who had been the occasions of it. And in particular, for the Bishop of
<hi>Winchester,</hi> if he had sought or procured his death, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God
heartily to forgive him, as Christ forgave his Murtherers. He prayed earnestly
for the King, and the Prince; and exhorted the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pray for them. He
said, some had reported that he had been a Preacher of Sedition and
Disobedience: But he declared to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, that they were bound by the Law of God, to obey their
Kings Laws with all humility, not only for fear, but for Conscience; adding,
that if the King commanded any thing against Gods Law, though it were in their
Power to resist him, yet they might not do it. Then he desired the Sheriff to
carry five requests from him to the King.</p>
            <q> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>First,</hi> That since he had taken the Abbey-Lands into his
hands, for which he did not blame him, (as the Sheriff fancied he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to
do, and thereupon stopped him,) but was glad that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition was taken away;
and that the King was then a compleat King, obeyed by all his Subjects, which
had been done through the Preaching of them, and such wretches as they were:
yet he wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King would bestow these goods, or some of them, to the
comfort of his poor Subjects who had great need of them.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Marriage might be had in greater esteem,
and that men might not upon light pretences cast off their Wives; and that
those who were unmarried, might not be suffered to live in Whoredome.</p> 
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Abominable Swearers might be punished.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That since the King had begun to set forth
Christian Religion, he would go forward in it, and make an end: for though he
had done a great deal, yet many things remained to be done, and he wished that
the King might not be deceived with false Teachers.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The fifth desire he said he had forgot.</p>
            <p>Then he begged that they all would forgive him, if at any time he
had said or done evil unadvisedly: and so turned about, and prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for his death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ierome</hi> spake next, and declared his Faith upon every
Article of the Creed; and said that he believed all that was in the Holy
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He also prayed for the King, and the Prince. And conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a
very Pathetical Exhortation to mutual Love and Charity; that they would propose
to themselves the pattern of Christs wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Love, through whom only he
hoped to be saved; and desired all their Prayers for himself and his Brethren.
Then <hi>Gerard</hi> declared his Faith, and said, That if through ignorance or
negligence, he had taught any error, he was sorry for it; and asked God pardon
and them, whom he had thereby offended. But he protested, that according to his
Learning and Knowledg, he had always set forth the honour of God, and the
obedience of the Kings Laws. Then they all prayed for the pardon of their Sins,
and constancie and patience in their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: And so they embraced and
kissed one another, and then the Executioners tyed them to the Stake, and set
fire to them.</p>
            <p>Their death did rather encourage than dishearten their followers:
who seeing such an extraordinary measure of patience in them, were the more
confirmed in their resolutions of suffering for a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, 
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:104314:174"/> and for his name, who did not forsake his Servants in
these cruel Agonies. One difference between their Sufferings, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
three who were hanged for asserting the Popes Supremacy, was remarkable; that
though the others demeaned themselves toward them with the most uncharitable
and spiteful malice that was possible, (so that their own Historian sayes, That
their being carryed with them to their Execution was bitterer to them than
death it self;) yet they declared their hearty forgiving of their Enemies, and
of <hi>Gardiner</hi> in particular, who was generally looked on as the person
that procured their death: which Imputation stuck fast to him, though by a
Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Apologie he studyed to clear himself of any other concernment in it,
than by giving his vote for the Act of their Attaindor.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Bonner</hi> began to shew his nature.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonners cruelty</hi>
               </note> Hitherto he had acted another
part. For being most extreamly desirous of Preferment, he had so complyed with
<hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that they had great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him;
and he being a blustering and forward man, they thought he might do the
Reformation good service, and therefore he was advanced so high by their means.
But as soon as ever <hi>Cromwel</hi> fell, the very next day he shewed his
Ingratitude, and how nimbly he turned with the Wind. For <hi>Grafton</hi> the
Printer, (whom <hi>Cromwel</hi> favoured much for his Printing the Bible, and
who was by that means very familiar with <hi>Bonner,</hi>) meeting him, said,
he was very sorry for the news he heard of <hi>Cromwels</hi> being sent to the
Tower. <hi>Bonner</hi> answered, it had been good he had been dispatcht long
ago. So the other shrunk away, perceiving the change that was in him. And some
days after that, <hi>Grafton</hi> being brought before the Council, for some
Verses which he was believed to have Printed in commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Cromwel,
Bonner</hi> informed the Council of what <hi>Grafton</hi> had said to him upon
<hi>Cromwels</hi> being Arrested, to make the other Charge seem the more
probable. Yet <hi>Audley</hi> the Chancelor was <hi>Graftons</hi> friend, and
brought him off. But <hi>Bonner</hi> gave the City of <hi>London</hi> quickly
cause to apprehend the utmost severities from him. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were endicted by
his procurement. Yet the King was loth to give too many Instances of Cruelty,
in this declination of his Age, and therefore by an order from the
<hi>Star-Chamber</hi> they were discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But upon what motives I cannot
fancie, he pickt out an Instance, which, if the deeper stains of his following
life had not dasht all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular spots, had been sufficient to have blemished
him for ever. There was one <hi>Richard Mekins</hi> a Boy not above fifteen
years of Age, and both Illiterate and very Ignorant, who had said somewhat
against the corporal presence of Christs Body in the Sacrament, and in
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Doctor <hi>Barnes.</hi> Upon this he was Endicted. The words
were proved by two witnesses, and a day was appointed for the Juries to bring
in their verdict. The day being come, the Grand Jury was called for, then the
Fore-man said, they had found nothing. This put <hi>Bonner</hi> in a fury, and
he charged them with Perjury: But they said they could find nothing, for the
witnesses did not agree. The one deposed, That he had said the Sacrament was
nothing but a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi>: and the other, That it was nothing but a
<hi>Signification.</hi> But <hi>Bonner</hi> still persisted and told them, that
he had said <hi>That Barnes dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Holy.</hi> But they could not find these
words to be against the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. <pb n="300" facs="tcp:104314:175"/> Upon which
<hi>Bonner</hi> cursed, and was in a great rage, and caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to go aside
again: So they being overawed, returned and found the Indictment. Then sate the
Jury vpon life and death, who found him Guilty: and he was adjudged to be
burnt. But when he was brought to the Stake, he was taught to speak much good
of <hi>Bonner,</hi> and to condemn all Hereticks, and <hi>Barnes</hi> in
particular, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had learned Heresie of him. Thus the Boy was made to die
with a lie in his mouth. For <hi>Barnes</hi> held not that opinion of the
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament's being only a Ceremony or signification, but was a zealous
<hi>Lutheran</hi>: which appeared very signally on many occasions, chiefly in
<hi>Lamberts</hi> case. Three others were also burned at <hi>Salisbury</hi>
upon the same Statute, one of whom was a Priest. Two also were burned at
<hi>Lincoln</hi> in one day. Besides, a great number of persons were brought in
trouble, and kept long in Prison upon the Statute of the six Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. But
more blood I find not spilt at this time.</p>
            <p>In the end of this year were the new Bishopricks founded. For in
<hi>December</hi> was the Abbey of <hi>Westminster</hi> converted into a
Bishops See,<note place="margin">New Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks

twelve Prebends, with the Officers for a Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral and a Quire. And in the
year following on the 4th of <hi>August,</hi> the King erected out of the
Monastery of St. <hi>Werburg</hi> at <hi>Chester,</hi> a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick, a Deanry,
and six Prebends. In <hi>September</hi> out, of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery at St.
<hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Glocester</hi> the King endowed a Bishoprick, a Deanry,
and six Prebendaries. And in the same Month, the Abbey of <hi>Peterborough</hi>
was converted to a Bishops seat, a Deanry, and six Prebendaries. And to lay
this whole matter together, two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, the Abbey of <hi>Osney</hi>
in <hi>Oxford</hi> was converted into a Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick, a Deanry, and six
Prebends. And the Monastery of St. <hi>Austins</hi> in <hi>Bristol</hi> was
changed into the same use. There are many other Grants also in the Rolls, both
to the Bishops, and Deans, and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of these Sees. But these Foundations
will be better understood, by their Charters: of which, since the Bishoprick of
<hi>Westminster</hi> is least known, because long ago suppressed, I have chosen
to set down the Charter of that See; which the Reader will find in the
Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And they running all in the same style, one may serve for the
rest.<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mb.</hi> 23.</note> The Substance of the Preamble is, 
<q>That the King being mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Grace of God, and intending
  nothing more than that true Religion, and the sincere worship of God, should
  not be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, but rather restored to the Primitive sincerity, and reformed
  from these abuses with which the profession and the lives of the Monks had so
  long and so lamentably corrupted Religion; had, as far as humane Infirmity
  could foresee, designed that the word of God might be sincerely Preached, the
  Sacraments purely administred, good Order kept up, the Youth well Instructed,
  and old people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, with other publick Almsdeeds. And therefore the King
  Erected and Endowed these Sees.</q> The day after these several Grants, there
followed a Writ to the Arch-Bishop, containing, that the King had appointed
such a person to be Bishop of that See, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring him to Consecrate and Ordain
him in due form. Then the Priories at most Cathedrals, such as <hi>Canterbury,
Winchester, Duresm, Worcester, Carliste, Rochester,</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> were
also converted into Dean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Colledges of Prebends, with many other
Officers, and <pb n="301" facs="tcp:104314:175"/> an allowance of Charity to be yearly
distributed to the poor.</p>
            <p>But as all this came far short of what the King had once
intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so <hi>Cranmers</hi> Design was quite disappointed.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> For he had
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that in every Cathedral there should be provision made for Readers,
of Divinity, and of <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and a great number of
Students to be both exercised in the daily worship of God, and trained up in
Study and Devotion; whom the Bishop might trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant out of this Nursery, into
all the parts of his Diocess. And thus every Bishop should have had a Colledge
of Clergy-men under his eye, to be preferred according to their merit: he saw
great disorders among some Prebendaries, and in a long Letter, the Original of
which I have seen, he expressed his regret that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hese Endowments went in such a
Channel. Yet now his Power was not great at Court, and the other party run down
all his motions. But these who observed things narrowly, judged that a good
mixture of Prebendaries, and of young Clerks bred up about Cathedrals, under
the Bishops eye, and the Conduct and Direction of the Dean and Prebendaries,
had been one of the greatest Blessings that could have befallen the Church:
Which not being sufficiently provided of Houses for the Forming of the minds
and manners of those who are to be received into Orders, has since felt the ill
effects of it very sensibly. Against this, <hi>Cranmer</hi> had projected a
Noble Remedy, had not the Popish party then at Court, who very well apprehended
the advantages such Nurseries would have given to the Reformation, born down
this Proposition, and turned all the Kings Bounty and Foundations another
way.</p>
            <p>These new Foundations gave some credit to the Kings proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and made the Suppression of Chantries and Chappels go on more smoothly. But
those of the <hi>Roman</hi> party beyond Sea,<note place="margin">These
  Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.</note> censur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, as they had done all the rest of
the Kings Actings. They said, it was but a slight Restitution of a small part
of the goods, of which he had robbed the Church. And they complained of the
Kings encroaching on the Spiritual Jurisdiction of the Church, by dismembring
Dioceses, and removing Churches from one Jurisdiction to another. To this it
was answered, that the necessities which their practices put on the King, both
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ortifie his Coast and
Dominions, to send money be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ond Sea
for keeping the War at a distance from himself, and to secure his quiet at
home, by easie grants of these Lands, made him that he could not do all that he
intended. And for the Division of Dioceses, many things were brought from the
<hi>Roman</hi> Law, to shew, That the Division of the Ecclesiastical
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, whether of
Patriarches, Primates, Metropolitans, or Bishops, was Regulated by the
Emperors; of which the Ancient Councils al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways approved. And in
<hi>England,</hi> when the Bishoprick of <hi>Lincoln</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judged of too
great an Extent, the Bishoprick of <hi>Ely</hi> was taken out of it, it was
done only by the King, with the consent of his Clergy and Nobles. Pope
<hi>Nicolas</hi> indeed officiously intruded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into that matter, by
sending afterwards a Confirmation of that which was done. But that was one of
the great Arts of the Papacy, to offer Confirmations of things that were done
without the Popes. For these being easily received by them, that thought of
nothing more than to give the better countenance to their own Acts, the 
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:104314:176"/> Popes afterwards founded a Right on these
Confirmations.<note place="margin">1541.</note> The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry receiving of them was
pretended to be an acknowledgment of a Title in the Pope. And the matter was so
artificially managed, that Princes were noozed into some approbation of such a
pretence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were aware of it. And then the Authority of the
Canon-Law prevailing, Maxims were laid down in it, by which the most tacite and
inconsiderate Acts of Princes, were construed to such sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as still
advanced the greatness of the Papal pretensions.</p>
            <p>This business of the new Foundations being thus setled, the
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church were now put in a method: and the Bishops Book was the
standard of Religion. So that whatsoever was not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that, was judged
Heretical, whether it leaned to the one side, or the other. But it seems that
the King by some secret Order had chained up the party, which was going on in
the Execution of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the six Articles, that they should not proceed
capitally.</p>
            <p>Thus matters went this year, and with this, the Series of the
Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Reformation,<note place="margin">The State of the Court at this
  time.</note> made by this King, ends: for it was now digested and formed into a
Body. What followed was not in a Thred, but now and then some remarkable things
were done: sometimes in favour of the one, and sometimes of the other party.
For after <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> fell, the King did not go on so steadily in any
thing as he had done formerly. <hi>Cromwel</hi> had an Ascendant over him,
which after Cardinal <hi>Wolseys</hi> fall none besides himself ever had. They
knew how to manage the Kings uneasie and imperious humor: But now none had such
a Power over him. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was rich and brave, and made his
Court well, but had not so great a Genius; so that the King did rather trust
and fear, than esteem him. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi> was only a Tool, and being of an
abject Spirit, was employed, but not at all reverenced by the King.
<hi>Cranmer</hi> retained always his candor and simplicity, and was a great
Prelate; but neither a good Courtier, nor a States-man. And the King esteemed
him more for his vertues, than for his dexterity and cunning in business. So
that now the King was left wholly to himself; and being extream hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and
impati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt, there were more errors
committed in the last years of his Government, than had been for his whole
Reign before <hi>France</hi> forsook him, <hi>Scotland</hi> made War upon him,
which might have been fatal to him, if their King had not dyed in the beginning
of it, leaving an Infant Princess, but a few days old, behind him. And though
the Emperor made peace with him, yet it was but an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low agreement. Of all
which I shall give but slender hints, in the rest of this Book; and rather open
some few particulars, than pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue a Continued Narration, since the matter of
my Work failes me.</p>
            <p>In <hi>May</hi> the 33d year of the Kings Reign, a new Impression
of the Bible was finished,<note place="margin"> 
                  <p>The Bible in <hi>English</hi> set up in all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</p> 
                  <p>Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.</p>
               </note> and the King by
Proclamation, 
<q>Required all Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and Parishioners of every Town and Parish,
  to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a Copy of it before All-Hallowtide: under the penalty of
  for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting forty Shillings a month, after that, till they had one. He declared
  that he set it forth, to the end that his people might by Reading it, perceive
  the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God: Observe his Commandments, obey the
  Laws, and their Prince, and <pb n="303" facs="tcp:104314:176"/> live in Godly Charity among
  themselves. But that the King did not thereby intend that his Subjects should
  presume to expound, or take arguments from Scripture; nor disturb Divine
  Service, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, when Mass was Celebrating: but should read it meekly,
  hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and reverently, for their Instruction, Edification, and
  Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> There was also care taken so to Regulate the Prices of the
Bibles, that there should be no exacting on the Subjects in the Sale of them.
And <hi>Bonner</hi> seeing the Kings mind was set on this, ordered six of these
great Bibles to be set up in several places of St. <hi>Pauls</hi>: that all
persons who could read, might at all times have free access to them. 
<q>And upon the Pillars to which these Bibles were chained,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  came thither to read; That they should lay aside vain-glory, hypocrisie, and
  all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupt affections, and bring with them, Discretion, good
  In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, Charity, Reverence, and a quiet behaviour: for the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of
  their own Souls; but not to draw multitudes about them, nor to make Expositions
  of what they read, nor to read aloud, nor make noise in time of Divine Service,
  nor enter into Disputes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</q> But people came generally to hear
the Scriptures read, and such as could read, and had clear voices, came often
thither with great Crowds about them. And many set their Children to School,
that they might carry them with them to St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and hear them read
the Scriptures. Nor could the people be hindred from entring into disputes
about some places: for who could hear the words of the Institution of the
Sacrament, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> or St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Discourse against
worship in an unknown tongue, and not from thence be led to consider, that the
people were deprived of the Cup, which by Christs express Command was to be
drunk by all; and that they were kept in a worship, to which the unlearned
could not say <hi>Amen,</hi> since they understood not what was said, either in
the Collects or Hymns? So the King had many Complaints brought him, of the
Abuses that were said to have risen from the Liberty given the people to read
the Scriptures. Upon which, <hi>Bonner,</hi> (no doubt having obtained the
Kings leave,) set up a new Advertisement; in which he complained of these
Abuses, in the reading the Bible: for which he threatned the people, that he
would remove these Bibles out of the Church, if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued as they did, to
abuse so high a favour. Yet these Complaints produced no further severity at
this time. But by them the Popish party afterwards obtained what they desired.
This Summer the King turned the Monastery of <hi>Burton</hi> upon
<hi>Trent,</hi> into a Collegiat Church for a Dean and four Prebends: and the
Monastery of <hi>Thornton</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnshire</hi> into another, for a
Dean and four Prebends.<note place="margin">1541.</note> In this year
<hi>Cranmer</hi> took it into Consideration,<note place="margin">

whereby those Revenues that ought to have been applyed to better purposes,<note place="margin">A Rule about Churchmens housekeeping.</note> were wasted on great
Entertainment which though they passed under the decent name of Hospitality,
yet were in themselves both too high and expensive, and proved great
hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances to Church-mens Charity, in more necessary and profitable Instances.
He therefore set out an Order, for Regulating that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: by which, an
Arch-Bishops Table was not to exceed six dish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of meat, and four of 
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellaria.</hi>

Deans or Arch-Deacons Table was not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed four dishes, and two of Banquet;
and other Clergy-men might be served only with two dishes. But he that gives us
the account of this, laments that this Regulation took no effect. And complains
that the people expecting generally such splendid House-keeping from the
Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified Clergy, and not considering how short their Revenues are, of what
they were anciently: they out of a weak Complyance with the Multitude, have
disabled themselves from keeping Hospitality, as our Saviour ordered it, not
for the Rich, but the Poor; not to mention the other ill effects that follow
too sumptuous a Table.</p>
            <p>In the end of this year, the Tragical fall of the Queen put a stop
to all other proceedings.<note place="margin">The King goes to <hi>

               </note> The King had invited
his Nephew the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to meet him at <hi>York,</hi> who was
resolved to come thither. The King intended to gain upon him all he could, and
to engage him to follow the Copy he had set him, in Extirpating the Popes
Supremacy, and Suppressing Abbeys, and to establish a firm agreement in all
other things. The Clergy of <hi>Scotland</hi> feared the ill effects of that
Interview, especially their King being a Prince of most extraordinary parts,
who, had he not blemished his Government with being so extreamly addicted to
his pleasures, was the Greatest Prince that Nation had for several Ages. He was
a great Patron of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Executor of Justice: he used in person and
<hi>Incognito,</hi> to go over his Kingdom, and see how Justice was every-where
done. He had no very good opinion of the Religious Orders, and had encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<hi>Buchanan</hi> to write a severe and witty Libel against the
<hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscan</hi> Friars. So that they were very apprehensive that he might
have been wrought on by his Uncle. Therefore they used all their endeavours to
divert his Journey. But the <hi>French</hi> King, that had him fast engaged to
his Interests, falling then off from the King, wrought more on him. So instead
of meeting the King at <hi>York,</hi> where magnificent preparations were made
for his Reception, he sent his Excuse; which provoked his Uncle, and gave
occasion to a breach that followed not long after.</p>
            <p>But here I shall crave the Readers leave to give a full
representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the state of Religion at this time in
<hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An account of the State of
  <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> and of the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Reformation had got there:
Its neighbourhood to <hi>England,</hi> and the union of these Kingdoms, first
in the same Religion, and since under the same Princes, together with the
intercourse that was both in this and the next Reign, between these Nations,
seem not only to justifie this Digression, but rather to challenge it as a part
of the History, without which it should be defective. And it may be the rather
expected from one, who had his Birth and Education in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Correspondence between that Crown and <hi>France</hi> was the
cause that what Learning they had,<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of
  Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there.</note> came from <hi>Paris</hi>: where our Kings generally
kept some Schollars, and from that great Nursery they were brought over, and
set in the Universities of <hi>Scotland</hi> to propagate Learning there. From
the year 1412, in which <hi>Wardlaw</hi> Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi>
first founded that University, Learning had made such a progress, that more
Colledges were soon after founded in that City. Universities were also founded
both at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> 
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:104314:177"/> which
have since furnished that Nation with many eminent Scholars in all professions.
But at the time that Learning came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the knowledg of true
Religion also followed it:<note place="margin">And of the Reformation.</note> and
in that same Arch-Bishops time, one <hi>Iohn Resby,</hi> an <hi>English</hi>
man, a follower of <hi>Wickliffs</hi> opinions, was charged with Heresie.<note place="margin">Arch-Bishop <hi>Spotswood.</hi>
               </note> Forty Articles were
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to him, of which two are only mentioned. The one was, that <hi>The
Pope is not Christs Vicar.</hi> The other was, that <hi>he was not to be
estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Pope, if he was a man of wicked life.</hi> For maintaining these,
he was burnt <hi>Anno</hi> 1407. 24 years after that, one <hi>Paul Cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> came out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and being a

                  <hi>Lesley.</hi>
               </note> was infusing his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine into some at
St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> which being discovered, he was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an obstinate
Heretick, and burnt there, <hi>Anno</hi> 1432. And to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage people to
prosecute such persons, <hi>Fogo,</hi> who had discovered him, was rewarded
with the Abbey of <hi>Melross</hi> soon after.</p>
            <p>It does not appear that those Doctrines, which were called
<hi>Lollar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> had gained many followers in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> till near the end of that Century. But then it was found
that they were much spread over the Western parts: which being in the
neighbourhood of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> those who were persecuted there, might
perhaps fly into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and spread their Doctrine in that
Kingdom.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Spotswood.</hi>
               </note> Several persons of
Quality were then charged with these Articles, and brought to the Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Glasgows</hi> Courts. But they answered him with such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that
he thought fit to discharge them; with an admonition to take heed of new
Doctrines, and to content themselves with the Faith of the Church.</p>
            <p>At this time the Clergy in <hi>Scotland</hi> were both very
ignorant and dissolute in their manners.<note place="margin">The Clergy were both
  ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and cruel.</note> The Secular Clergy minded nothing but their Tithes,
and did either hire some Friers to Preach, or some poor Priests to sing Masses
to them at their Churches. The Abbots had possessed themselves of the best
seats, and the greatest wealth of the Nation: and by a profuse Superstition,
almost the one half of the Kingdom fell into the hands of the Churchmen. The
Bishops looked more after the affairs of the State, than the concerns of the
Church; and were resolved to maintain by their cruelty, what their
Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors had acquired by fraud and impostures. And as <hi>Lesly</hi>
himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, there was no pains taken to instruct the people in the
princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion; nor were the Children at all Catechised, but left in
ignorance: and the ill lives of the Clergy, who were both covetous and lewd,
disposed the people to favour those that preached for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The first
that suffered in this Age was <hi>Patrick Hamilton,</hi> a person of very noble
blood:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Patrick Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>'s suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> his
Father was Brother to the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and his Mother Sister to the
Duke of <hi>Albany</hi>; so nearly was he on both sides related to the King. He
was provided of the Abbey of <hi>Fern</hi> in his youth; and being designed for
greater preferments, he was sent to travel: but as he went thorough
<hi>Germany,</hi> he contracted a friendship with <hi>Luther, Melanction,</hi>
and others of their Perswasion; by whose means he was instructed in the points
about which they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He returned to
<hi>Scotland,</hi> that he might communicate that knowledg to others with which
himself was so happily enlightned. And little considering, either the hindrance
of his further Preferment, or the other dangers that might lie in his 
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:104314:178"/> way, he spared not to lay open the Corruptions of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, and to shew the Errours that had crept into the
Christian Religion. He was a man both of great learning, and of a sweet and
charming conversation, and came to be followed and esteemed by all sorts of
people.</p>
            <p>The Clergy being enraged at this, invited him to St.
<hi>Andrews,</hi> that there might be Conferences held with him, about those
points which he condemned. And one Frier <hi>Campbel,</hi> Prior of the
<hi>Dominicans,</hi> who had the reputation of a Learned man, was appointed to
treat with him. They had many Conferences together, and the Prior seemed to be
convinced in most points; and acknowledged there were many things in the Church
that required Reformation. But all this while he was betraying him; So that
when the Abbot looked for no such thing, he was in the night time made
Prisoner, and carried to the Arch-Bishops Castle. There several Articles were
objected to him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Original Sin, Free-will, Justification, Good Works,
Priestly Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, Auricular Confession, Purgatory, and the Popes being
Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. Some of these he positively adhered to, the others he thought were
disputable points; yet he said he would not condemn them, except he saw better
reasons than any he had yet heard. The matter was referred to 12 Divines of the
University, of whom Frier <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> was one. And within a day or two
they censured all his Tenets as Heretical, and contrary to the Faith of the
Church. On the first of <hi>March</hi> Judgment was given upon him, by
<hi>Beaton</hi> Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> with whom sate the
Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Dunkeld, Brichen</hi> and
<hi>Dunblan,</hi> five <hi>Abbots,</hi> and many of the inferior Clergy. They
also made the whole University, old and young, sign it. He was declared an
obstinate Heretick, and delivered to the Secular Power.</p>
            <p>The King had at that time gone a Pilgrimage to <hi>Ross,</hi> and
the Clergy fearing lest nearness of blood, with the Intercessions which might
be made for him, should snatch this prey out of their hands, proceeded that
same day to his Execution. So in the afternoon he was brought to the Stake
before St. <hi>Salvators</hi> Colledg. He stripped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of his Garments,
and gave them to his man; and said, <hi>he had no more to leave him, but the
example of his death. That he prayed him to keep in mind. For though it was
bitter and painful in mans Iudgment, yet it was the entrance to Everlasting
life, which none could inherit that denied Christ before such a
Congregation.</hi> Then was he tied to a Stake, and a great deal of fewel was
heaped about him: which he seemed not to fear. but continued lifting up his
eyes to heaven, and recommending his soul to God. When the train of Powder was
kindled, it did not take hold of the Fewel, but only scorched his hand, and the
side of his face. This occasioned some delay, till more powder was brought from
the Castle; during which time the Friers were very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and called to
him to turn, and pray to our Lady, and say <hi>Salve Regina.</hi> None was more
officious than Frier <hi>Campbel.</hi> The Abbot wished him often to let him
alone, and give him no more trouble. But the Frier continuing to importune him;
he said to him, <hi>Wicked man, thou knowest that I am not an Heretick, and
that it is the truth of God for which I now suffer. So much thou didst confess
to me in private: and <pb n="307" facs="tcp:104314:178"/> thereupon I appeal thee to answer
before the Iudgment Seat of Christ.</hi> By this time more powder was brought
and the fire was kindled. He cried out with a loud voice, <hi>How long, O Lord,
shall darkness oppress this Realm? how long wilt thou suffer this Tyranny of
Men?</hi> and died repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these words, <hi>Lord Iesus receive my
Spirit.</hi> The patience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy he expressed in his sufferings, made
the Spectators generally conclude that he was a true Martyr of Christ: in which
they were the more confirmed, by Frier <hi>Campbells</hi> falling into great
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair soon after, who from that turned frantick, and died within a year.</p>
            <p>On this I have insisted the more fully, because it was indeed the
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and raised there an humour
of inquiring into points of Religion, which did always prove fatal to the

<hi>Seaton</hi> a Dominican Frier who was the Kings Confessor. He being
appointed to preach the next Lent at St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> insisted much on
these points: 
<q>That the Law of God was the only Rule of Righteousness, that Sin
  was only committed when Gods Law was violated, that no man could satisfie for
  Sin, and that pardon was to be obtained by unfeigned repentance and true
  faith.</q> But he never mentioned Purgatory, Pilgrimages, Merits, nor Prayers
to Saints; which used to be the Subjects on which the Friers insisted most on
these occasions. Being gone from St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> he heard that another
Frier of his own Order had refuted these Doctrines. So he returned, and
confirmed them in another Sermon; in which he also made some reflections on
Bishops that were not <hi>Teachers,</hi> calling them <hi>Dumb-Dogs.</hi> For
this he was carried before the Arch-Bishop; but he defended himself, saying,
that he had only in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words said <hi>a Bishop should
teach,</hi> and in <hi>Esaias</hi> words, that such as did not teach were
<hi>Dumb-doggs</hi>: but having said this in the general, he did not apply it
to any Bishop in particular. The Arch-Bishop was netled at this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, yet
resolved to let him alone till he should be brought into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace with the
King. And that was soon done, for the King being a licentious Prince, and Frier
<hi>Seaton</hi> having often reproved him boldly for it, he grew weary of him.
The Clergy perceiving this, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to fall upon him. So he withdrew to
<hi>Berwick,</hi> but wrote to the King, that if he would hear him make his
defence, he would return and justifie all that he had taught. He taxed the
cruelty of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and desired the King would restrain their Tyranny, and
consider that he was obliged to protect his Subjects from their severity and
malice. But receiving no satisfactory answer, he lived in <hi>England,</hi>
where he was entertain'd by the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> as his Chaplain. Not
long after this, one <hi>Forrest,</hi>

                  <hi>Forrest</hi>'s
  suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</note> a simple <hi>Benedictin</hi> Monk was accused for having
said that <hi>Patrick Hamilton had died a Martyr</hi>: yet since there was no
sufficient proof to convict him; a Frier one <hi>Walter Lainge</hi> was sent to
confess him, to whom in Confession he acknowledged, he thought
<hi>Hamilton</hi> was a good man, and that the Articles for which he was
condemned, might be defended. This being revealed by the Frier, was taken for
good evidence. So the poor man was condemned to be burnt as an Heretick. As he
was led out to his Execution, he said, <hi>Fie on falshood, fie on Friers,
revealers of Confession; Let never man <pb n="308" facs="tcp:104314:179"/> trust them after
me: they are despisers of God, and deceivers of men.</hi> When they were
considering in what place to burn him, a simple man, that attended the
Arch-bishop, advised to burn him in some low Cellar; for said he, <hi>the smoak
of Mr.</hi> Patrick Hamilton <hi>has infected all those on whom it
blew.</hi>

               </note>Soon after this,
Abbot <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Brother and Sister were brought into the Bishops
Courts: but the King, who favoured this Brother, perswaded him to absent
himself. His Sister and six others being brought before the Bishop of
<hi>Ross,</hi> who was deputed by the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to proceed against them, the
King himself dealt with the Woman to abjure, which she and the other six did.
Two others were more resolute, The one was <hi>Normand Gowrlay,</hi> who was
charged with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Popes Authority in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and saying
there was no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory: The other was <hi>David Straiton.</hi> He was charged
with the same Opinions. They also alledged that he had denied that Tithes were
due to Church-men: and that when the Vicar came to take the Tith out of some
Fish-boats that belonged to him, he alledged the Tith was to be taken where the
stock grew, and therefore ordered the tenth fish to be cast into the Sea, and
bade the Vicar to seek them there. They were both judged obstinate Hereticks,
and burnt at one Stake the 27th of <hi>August,</hi> 1534. Upon this persecution
some others who were cited to appear fled into <hi>England.</hi> Those were
<hi>Alexander Alesse, Iohn Fife, Iohn Mackbee,</hi> and one
<hi>Mackdowgall.</hi> The first of these was received by <hi>Cromwel</hi> into
his Family, and grew into great favour with King <hi>Henry,</hi> and was
commonly called his Scholar; of whom see what was said Page 214. But after
<hi>Cromwels</hi> death, he took <hi>Fife</hi> with him, and they went into
<hi>Saxony,</hi> and were both Professors in <hi>Leipsick. Mackbee</hi> was at
first entertained by <hi>Shaxton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>; but he went
afterwards into <hi>Denmark,</hi> where he was known by the name of Doctor
<hi>Maccabeus,</hi> and was Chaplain to King <hi>Christian</hi> the second.</p>
            <p>But all these violent proceedings were not effectual enough to

searching the Scriptures came to the knowledg of the Truth: and the noise of
what was then doing in <hi>England,</hi> awakned others to make further
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into matters of Religion. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th apprehending
that King <hi>Henry</hi> might prevail on his Nephew to follow his

                  <hi>Lesley.</hi>
               </note> wrote Letters full of
earnest exhortations to him to continue in the Catholick Faith. Upon which King
<hi>Iames</hi> called a Parliament, and there in the presence of the Popes
Nuncio, declared his zeal for that Faith and the Apostolick See. The Parliament
also concurred with him in it; and made acts against Hereticks, and for
maintaining the Popes authority. That same Pope did afterwards send to desire
him to assist him in making war against the King of <hi>England</hi>; for he
was resolved to divide that Kingdom among those who would assist him in driving
out King <hi>Henry.</hi> But the firm peace at that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King of
<hi>England</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, kept him quiet from any trouble,
which otherwise the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> might have given him. Yet King
<hi>Henry</hi> sent the Bishop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> with the Duke of
<hi>Norfolks</hi> Brother, Lord <hi>William Howard</hi> to him, so
unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, that they came to him at <hi>Sterlin</hi> before he had heard of
their <pb n="309" facs="tcp:104314:179"/> being sent. The Bishop brought with him some of
the Books that had been writ for the justifying King <hi>Henry</hi>'s

            <p>The secret business they came for, was, to perswade that King to
concur with his Uncle, and to agree an Interview between them: and they offered
him in their Masters name the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and that he
should be made Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and

               </note> Lord Lieutenant of all
<hi>England.</hi> But the Clergy diverted him from it, and perswaded him rather
to go on in his design of a match with <hi>France.</hi> And their Counsels did
so prevail, that he resolved to go in person, and fetch a Queen from thence. On
the first of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1537. he was married to <hi>Magdalen,</hi>
daughter to <hi>Francis</hi> the First. But she being then gone far in a
Consumption, died soon after he had brought her home, on the 28th of
<hi>May.</hi> She was much lamented by all persons, the Clergy only excepted:
for she had been bred in the Queen of <hi>Navarres</hi> Court, and so they
apprehended she might incline the King to a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But he had seen
another Lady in <hi>France, Mary</hi> of <hi>Guise,</hi> whom he then liked so
well; that after his Queens death, he sent Cardinal <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> into
<hi>France</hi> to treat for a match with her. This gave the Clergy as much joy
as the former marriage had raised fear; for no Family in Christendome was more
devoted to the interests of the Papacy than that was. And now the King though
he had freer thoughts himself, yet was so engaged to the pretended old
Religion, that he became a violent persecutor of all who differed from it.</p>
            <p>The King grew very expensive,<note place="margin">The King wholly
  guided by the Clergy.</note> he indulged himself much in his pleasures; he
built four noble Palaces, which considering that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and that Age, were
very extraordinary Buildings; he had also many natural Children: All which
things concurred to make him very desirous of Money. There were two different
parties in the Court. The Nobility on the one hand represented to him, the
great wealth that the Abbots had gathered; and that if he would do as his
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle had done, he would thereby raise his Revenue to the triple of what it
was, and provide plentifully for his Children. The Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy on the other hand
assured him, that if he would set up a strict inquisition of Hereticks, he
would discover so many men of Estates that were guilty, that by their
Forfeitures he might raise above an hundred thousand Crowns a year: And for his
Children, the easiest way of providing for them, was to give them good Abbies
and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories. This they thought would engage both the King and his Sons to
maintain their Rights more steadily, if their own Interests were interwoven
with them. They also perswaded the King that if he maintained the established
Religion, it would give him a good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in <hi>England,</hi> and make him
be set up by forreign Princes as the head of the League, which the Pope and the
Emperor were then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting against King <hi>Henry.</hi> These Counsels being
seconded by his Queen, who was a wise and good Lady, but wonderfully zealous
for the Papacy, did so prevail with him, that as he made four of his Children
Abbots or Priors, so he gave way to the persecuting humor of 
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:104314:180"/> his Priests: and give Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> (a
natural Brother of the Earl of <hi>Arrans,</hi> in whom the Clergy put much
confidence, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to proceed against all that were suspected of
Heresie. In the year 1539. many were cited to appear before a meeting of the
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Of those, nine abjured, many were banished and
five were burnt. <hi>Forrester,</hi> a Gentleman, <hi>Simpson,</hi> a Secular
Priest; <hi>Killore,</hi> and <hi>Beverage,</hi> two Friers; and
<hi>Forrest,</hi> a Canon Regular; were burnt on the <hi>Castle-hill</hi> of
<hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The last of these was a zealous constant Preacher, which
was a rare thing in those days. His Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan, the Bishop of <hi>Dunkeld</hi>
sent for him, and rebuked him for it; and bid him, <hi>When he found a good
Epistle, or good Gospel, that made for the liberties of the Holy Church, to
preach on that, and let the rest alone.</hi> The good man answered; <hi>he had
read both the Old Testament, and the New, and never found an ill Epistle, or
ill Gospel in any of them.</hi> The Bishop replied, that <hi>he thanked God he
had lived well these many years, and never knew either the Old or New: he
contented himself with his Portuise, and his Pontifical; and if the other would
trouble himself with these fantasies, he would repent it when he could not help
it.</hi> Forrest <hi>said, He was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do what he conceived was his
duty, whatever might be the danger of it.</hi> By this it appears how
deliberately the Clergy at that time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered themselves up to Ignorance and
Superstition.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Two other Martyrs.</note>In the same year
<hi>Russel,</hi> a <hi>Franciscan</hi> Frier, and one <hi>Kennedy,</hi> a young
man of 18 years of age, were brought before the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow.</hi> That Bishop was a learned and moderate man, and was much
against these cruel proceedings: he was also in great credit with the King,
having been his Tutor. Yet he was forced by the threatnings of his Brethren, to
go on with the persecution. So those two, <hi>Russel,</hi> and
<hi>Kennedy,</hi> being brought before him, <hi>Kennedy,</hi> that was young
and fearful, had resolved to submit and abjure. But being brought to the Bar,
and encouraged by <hi>Russels</hi> discourses, he felt so high a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of
courage and joy in his heart, that he fell down on his knees, and broke forth
in these words; 
<q>Wonderful, O God, is thy love and mercy towards me a miserable
  wretch: for now, when I would have denied thee, and thy Son my Saviour, thou
  hast by thine own hand pulled me back from the bottom of Hell, and given me
  most Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly comfort, which hath removed the ungodly fear that before
  oppressed my mind. Now I defie death, do what you please, I thank God I am
  ready.</q> There followed a long dispute between the Frier and the Divines that
sate with the Arch-Bishop: but when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they would hear nothing, and
answered him only with revilings and jeers, he gave it over and concluded in
these words; 
<q>This is your hour and power of darkness: now you sit as Judges,
  and we stand wrongfully condemned; but the day cometh which will shew our
  innocence, and you shall see your own blindness to your everlasting confusion;
  Go on, and fulfil the measure of your iniquity.</q> This put the Arch-Bishop in
great confusion, so that he said to those about him, that these rigorous
executions did hurt the cause of the Church more than could be well thought of;
and he declared that his opinion was, that their lives should be spared, and
some other course taken with them. But those that sate with him said, if he
took a course different from what the other Prelates had taken, he was not the
Churches <pb n="211" facs="tcp:104314:180"/> friend. This, with other threatning
expressions, prevailed so far on his fears, that he gave Judgment. So they were
burnt; but at their death they expressed so much constancy and joy, that the
people were much wrought on by their behaviour. <hi>Russel</hi> encouraged
<hi>Kennedy,</hi> his partner in sufferings, in these words. 
<q>Fear not, Brother, for he is more mighty that is in us, than he
  that is in the world; the pain which we shall suffer is short, and light; but
  our joy and consolation shall never have an end. Death cannot destroy us, for
  it is destroyed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by him, for whose sake we suffer. Therefore let us
  strive to enter in by the same strait way, which our Saviour hath taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
  us.</q> With the blood of such Martyrs was the field of that Church sowen,
which did quickly rise up in a plentiful harvest.</p>
            <p>Among those that were at this time in hazard, <hi>George
Buchanan</hi> was one. The Clergy were resolved to be revenged on him for the
sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Poems he had written against them. And the King had so
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely left all men to their mercy, that he had died with the rest, if he
had not made his escape out of Prison: Then he went beyond Sea, and lived 20
years in that Exile, and was forced to teach a School most part of the time;
yet the greatness of his mind was not oppressed with that mean employment. In
his writings there appears, not only all the beauty and graces of the Latine
Tongue, but a vigor of mind and quickness of thought, far beyond
<hi>Bembo,</hi> or the other <hi>Italians,</hi> who at that time affected to
revive the purity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Stile. It was but a feeble imitation of
<hi>Tully</hi> in them; but his stile is so natural and nervous, and his
reflections on things are so solid, (besides his immortal Poems, in which he
shews how well he could imitate all the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, in their several
ways of writing, that he who compares them, will be often tempted to prefer the
Copy to the Original,) that he is justly reckoned the greatest and best of our
modern Authors. This was the state of affairs at this time in
<hi>Scotland.</hi> And so I shall leave this digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, on which if I have
stayed too long, my kindness to my native Countrey must be my excuse; and now I
return to the affairs of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King went his progress with his fair and beloved Queen, and he
when came to <hi>York,</hi> he issued out a Proclamation, 
<q>
                  <hi>That all who</hi> had been aggrieved for want of Justice, by
  any whom he had formerly employed, should come to him, and his Counsel for
  redress.</q> This was done to cast all past miscarrages on <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
and to put the people in hopes of better times. But upon his return to
<hi>London,</hi> he met with a new affliction. He was so much taken with his
Queen, that on All-Saints day, when he received the Sacrament, he openly gave
God thanks for the good life he led, and trusted still to lead with her: and
desired his Ghostly Father to joyn with him in the same Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to God.
But this joy lasted not long: for the next day, the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> came to him, and gave him a doleful account of the Queens
ill Life, as it had been brought him by one <hi>Iohn Lassels</hi>: Who, when
the King was in his Progress, had told him that his Sister, who had been an old
Servant of the Duke of <hi>Norfolks,</hi> under whose care the Queen was
brought up, said to him, that the Queen was lewd, and that one <hi>Francis
Deirham</hi> had enjoyed her often; as also one <hi>Mannock</hi>; with other
foul circumstances, not fit to be related. The Arch-Bishop communicated it to
the Lord Chancellor, and the other <pb n="312" facs="tcp:104314:181"/> Privy Councellors
that were at <hi>London.</hi> They agreed, that the Arch-Bishop should open it
to the King. But he not knowing how to do it in Discourse, set it down in
writing, and put it in the Kings hands. When the King read it,<note place="margin">The Queens ill life is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note> he seemed much
perplexed; but loved the Queen so tenderly, that he looked on it as a Forgery.
And now the Arch-Bishop was in extream danger, for if full evidence had not
been brought, it had been certainly turned on him to his ruine. The King
imparted it to some other Councellors, and told them, that he could not believe
it, yet he would try it out, but with all possible secrecty. So the Lord
Privy-Seal was sent to <hi>London,</hi> to examine <hi>Lassels,</hi> who stood
to what he had informed. Then he sent that same Lord into <hi>Sussex,</hi>
where <hi>Lassels</hi> Sister lived, to try if she would justifie what her
Brother had reported in her name. And she owning it, he ordered
<hi>Deirham</hi> and <hi>Mannock</hi> to be arrested upon some other pretences;
But they being examined, not only confessed what was informed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
some other circumstances that shewed the Queen had laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all sense of
Modesty, as well as the fear of a Discovery; three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral women having been
witnesses to these her lewd practices. The report of that struck the King into
a most profound Pensiveness, and he burst out into tears, and lamented his
misfortune. The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and some other Counsellors,
were sent to examine the Queen. She at first denied every thing, but when she
perceived it was already known,<note place="margin">And confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by her self
  and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> she confessed all, and set it under her hand. There were
also evident presumptions that she had intended to continue that Course of
Life: for, as she had got <hi>Deirham</hi> into her service, so she had brought
one of the Women, who had been formerly privy to their familiarities, to serve
about her Bed-chamber. One <hi>Culpeper</hi> was also charged upon vehement
suspicion: For when the King was at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> by the Lady
<hi>Rochfords</hi> means, he was brought into the Queens Chamber at 11 a clock
in the night, and stayed there till four the next morning. The Queen also gave
him a Gold Chain, and a rich Cap. He being examined confessed the Crime; for
which, both <hi>Deirham,</hi> and he suffered. Others were also Endited of
misprision of Treason, and condemned to perpetual Imprisonment. But this
occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a new Parliament to be Summoned.</p>
            <p>On the 16th of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the Parliament met: to which, the
Bishops of <hi>Westminster,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1542.</note> 
               <hi>Chester,
Peterborough,</hi> and <hi>Glocester,</hi> had their Writs. The Lord
<hi>Cromwel</hi> also had his Writ,<note place="margin">A new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
  cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> though I do not find by any Record that he was restored in
Blood. On the 28th of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> the Lord Chancellor moved the House of
Lords, to consider the case the King was in, by the Queens ill carriage: and
that there might be no ground of suspition or complaint, he proposed that some
of their number should be sent to examine the Queen. Whereupon the Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Southampton</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Westminster,</hi> were sent to her.
How much She Confessed to them, is not very clear, neither by the Journal, nor
the Act of Parliament: which only says, that she confessed, without mentioning
the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Upon this, the processes of those that had been formerly
attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, being also brought as an Evidence, the Act passed in both Houses.
In it they Petitioned the King,</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:104314:181"/> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>First,</hi> Not to be troubled at the matter, since 
  <note place="margin">1542.</note> that might be a mean to shorten
  his Life.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the

               <p> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Queen and her Complices might be
  attainted of High Treason, for her taking <hi>Deirham</hi> into her service;
  and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Woman into her Chamber, who had known their former ill Life; by
  which it appeared what she intended to do: and then admitting
  <hi>Culpeper,</hi> to be so long with Her, in a vile place so many hours in the
  night. Therefore it is desired, that she and they, with the Bawd, the Lady
  <hi>Rochford,</hi> may be Attainted of Treason; and that the Queen and the Lady
  <hi>Rochford</hi> should suffer the pains of Death.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That the Dutchess Dowager of
  <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Countess of <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> the Lord <hi>William

  Attainted by the Course of Common Law, (except the Dutchess of

  Queens vicious Life, and had concealed it, should be all Attainted of
  Misprision of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p> 
               <p> It was also Enacted, that whosoever knew any thing of the
  In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence of the Queen, (for the time being,) should reveal it with all
  possible speed under the pains of Treason. And that if the King or his
  Successors should intend to marry any Woman, whom they took to be a pure and
  clean Maid; if she, not being so, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the same to the King, it
  should be High Treason: and all who knew it, and did not reveal it, were guilty
  of Misprision of Treason. And if the Queen, or the Princes Wife, should procure
  any by Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, or words, to know her carnally; or any other by Messages or
  words should sollicite them; they, their Councellors, and Abettors, are to be

<hi>Tower-Hill</hi> the 12th of <hi>February.</hi> The Queen confessed the
miscarriages of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life, before the King married her. But stood
absolutely to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, as to any thing after that: and protested to Dr.
<hi>White</hi> afterwards Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> That she took God and
his Angels to be her Witnesses, upon the Salvation of her Soul, that she was
guiltless of that Act of defiling her Soveraigns bed, for which she was
condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Yet the Lasciviousness of her former Life, made people incline to
believe any ill thing that could be reported of her. But for the Lady
<hi>Rochford,</hi> every body observed Gods Justice on her; who had the chief
hand, both in Queen <hi>Anne Boleyns,</hi> and her own Husbands death: and it
now appearing so evidently what sort of Woman she was, it tended much to raise
their Reputations again, in whose Fall, her spite, and other Artifices had so
great a hand. She had been a Lady of the Bed-Chamber to the last four Queens:
But now it was found how unworthy she was of that Trust.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:104314:182"/>It was thought extream cruelty to be so
severe to the Queens kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, for not discovering her former ill life. Since
the making such a discovery had been inconsistent with the Rules of Justice or
Decency. The old Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> being her Grandmother, had bred
her of a Child: and it was said, for her to have gone, and told the King, That
she was a Whore, when he intended to marry her, as it was an unheard-of thing,
so the not-doing of it could not have drawn so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a punishment, from any
but a Prince of that Kings temper. But the King pardoned her, and most of the
rest; tho some continued in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son after the rest were discharged.</p>
            <p>But for the other part of this Act, obliging a Woman to reveal her
own former Incontinence; if the King intended to marry her, (which by a mistake
the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> sayes was passed in another Act, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it from
<hi>Hall,</hi> and not looking into the Record:) It was thought a piece of
grievous Tyranny; since if a King, especially one of so imperious a temper, as
this was, should design such an honour to any of his Subjects, who had failed
in their former life; they must either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame themselves, by publishing so
disgraceful a secret, or run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being afterwards attainted of
Treason. Upon this, those that took an indiscreet liberty to rally that Sex
injustly and severely, said, the King could induce none that was reputed a Maid
to Marry him: so that not so much choice, as necessity, put him on Marrying a
Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow about two years after this. But this part of the Act was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
repealed in the first Parliament of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th.</p>
            <p>There passed another Act in this Parliament, that made way for the
dissolution of Colledges,<note place="margin">Act about Hospitals,
  <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Hospitals, and other Foundations of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The
Courtiers had been practising with the Presidents and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of some of
these, to make Resignations of them to the King; which were conceived in the
same stile that most of the surrenders of Monasteries did run in. Eight of
these were all really procured, which are enrolled. But they could not make any
great progress, because it was provided by the Local Statutes of most of them,
that no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, or any other Fellows could make any such Deed, without the
Consent of all the Fellows in the House; and this could not be so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obtained. Therefore all such Statutes were annulled, and none were any more to
be sworn to the observation of them.</p>

against it. It was certainly the greatest eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore of the Popish party: and

there was no opposing it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, for the King was fully resolved to go

condemned, and then to promise a new one: in the making and publishing of

another singular conceit: He fancied there were many words in the New

the Bishops were resolved, either to condemn the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of the Bible, or
to proceed so slowly in it, that it should come to nothing. Therefore he moved
the King to refer the perusing of it to the two Universities. The Bishops took
this very ill, when <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> intimated it to them in the Kings name;
and objected that the Learning of the Universities was much decayed of late,
and that the two Houses of Convocation were the more proper Judges of that,
where the Learning of the Land was chiefly gathered together. But the
Arch-Bishop said he would stick close to the Kings pleasure, and that the
Universities should examine it. Upon which, all the Bishops of his Province,

vileness of Sin; and should also explain the Prayers for that day, that so the
People might pray with one heart; and should teach them the use of the

            </q>
            <p>These Injunctions, especially when they are considered at their
full length, will give great light into the temper of men at that time: and
particularly inform us of the design and method of Preaching,<note place="margin">The manner of Preaching at that time.</note> as it was then set
forward. Concerning which the Reader will not be ill pleased to receive some
information. In the time of Popery there had been few Sermons but in Lent: for
their discourses on the Holydays, were rather Panegyricks on the Saint, or the
vain magnifying of some of their Reliques, which were laid up in such or such
places. In Lent there was a more solemn and serious way of Preaching; and the
Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, who chiefly maintained their credit by their performances at that
time, used all the force of their skill and industry to raise the People into
heats, by passionate and affecting discourses. Yet these generally tended to
raise the value of some of the Laws of the Church, such as 
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:104314:183"/> Abstinence at that time, Confession, with other Corporal
Severities; or some of the little devices, that both inflamed a blind Devotion,
and drew Money; such as Indulgences, Pilgrimages, or the enriching the Shrines,
and Reliques of the Saints. But there was not that pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to inform the
People of the hatefulness of Vice, and the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Holiness, or of the
wonderful Love of Christ, by which men might be engaged to acknowledge and obey
him. And the design of their Sermons was rather to raise a present heat, which
they knew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards how to manage, than to work a real Reformation on their
Hearers. They had also intermixt with all Divine Truths so many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that
they were become very extravagant; and that alloy had so embased the whole,
that there was great need of a good discerning, to deliver People from those
prejudices, which these mixtures brought upon the whole Christian Doctrine.
Therefore the Reformers studied with all possible care, to instruct the People
in the Fundamentals of Christianity, with which they had been so little
acquainted. From hence it came, that the People ran after those New Preachers
with wonderful zeal. It is true, there seem to be very foul and indiscreet
re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lections on the other Party, in
some of their Sermons. But if any have applied themselves much to observe what
sort of men, the Fryars, and the rest of the Popish Clergy were at that time;
they shall find great excuses for those heats. And as our Saviour laid open the
Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisies and Impostures of the Scribes and Pharisees, in a style which such
corruptions extorted; so there was great cause given to treat them very
roughly: tho it is not to be denied, but those Preachers had some mixtures of
their own resentments, for the cruelties and ill usage which they received from
them. But now that the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made a greater progress, much pains was
taken to send eminent Preachers over the Nation: not confining them to
particular charges, but sending them with the Kings Licence, up and down to
many places. Many of these Licences are enrolled, and it is likely that many
were granted that were not so carefully preserved. But provision was also made
for peoples daily Instruction: and because in that ignorant time, there could
not be found a sufficient number of good Preachers, and in a time of so much
jugling, they would not trust the Instruction of the people to every one;
Therefore none was to Preach except he had gotten a particular Licence for it,
from the King, or his Diocesan. But to qualifie this, a Book of Homilies was
Printed: in which the Gospels and Epistles of all the Sundays, and Holidays of
the year were set down, with an Homily to every one of these, which is a plain
and practical Paraphrase on those parcels of Scripture. To these are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
many serious exhortations, and some short explanations of the most obvious
difficulties, that shew the Compiler of them was a man both of good judgement
and learning. To these were also added, Sermons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on several occasions; as for
Weddings, Christnings, and Funerals; and these were to be read to the people by
such as were not Licensed to Preach. But those who were Licensed to Preach,
being oft accused for their Sermons, and Complaints being made to the King by
hot men on both sides; they came generally to write and read their Sermons.
From thence the reading of Sermons grew into a practise in this Church: in
which, if there was not that heat, and fire, which the <pb n="318" facs="tcp:104314:184"/>

Declamations, so that the passions of the Hearers were not so much wrought on
by it; yet it has produced the greatest Treasure of weighty, grave and solid
Sermons, that ever the Church of God had; which does in a great measure
compensate that seeming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

greatest blemish of that time. These were the Stage-plays and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, that

Poems were ill contriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they were not,) which at this distance is lost. But from the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the
immoralities and disorders of the Clergy, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act the Pageantry
of their Worship. This took with the people much, who being provoked by the
miscarriages and cruelties of some of the Clergy, were not ill pleased to see
them and their Religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to publick scorn. The Clergy complained much
of this; and said it was an introduction to Atheism, and all sort of
Irreligion. For if once they began to mock sacred things, no stop could be put
to that petulant humour. The grave and learned sort of Reformers disliked and
condemned these courses, as not sutable to the <hi>genius</hi> of true
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but the political men of that party, made great use of them,
encouraging them all they could; for they said, Contempt being the most
operative and lasting affection of the mind, nothing would more effectually
drive out many of those Abuses, which yet remained, than to expose them to the
contempt and scorn of the people.</p>

Homage was done for the Crown of <hi>Scotland.</hi> To this the Scots replied,
that in the Invasion of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, he had carried away all
their ancient Records; so these being lost, they could only appeal to the
Chronicles that lay up and down the Nation in their Monasteries: That all these
affirmed the contrary, and that they were a free Kingdom; till <hi>Edward</hi>
the first taking advantage of their disputes about the Succession to their
Crown, upon the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, got some of the

Writers answered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That these submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions by their Records, (which were
the solemn Instruments of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ought never to be called in

consent of their States. In this uncertainty I must leave it with the
Reader.</p>

               <q>But after the King had opened this Pretension, he complained of
  the disorders committed by the Scots; of the unkind returns he had met with

They loved not to be commanded by any but their King, and were already weary of
the insolence of that Favourite, who being but of ordinary birth,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scotish</hi> Army defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> was despised by them;
so that they were begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to separate. And when they were upon that occasion
in great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, a small body of <hi>English,</hi> not above 500 Horse
appeared. But they apprehending it was the Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> Army,
refused to fight, and fell in confusion. Many Prisoners were taken, the chief
of whom were, the Earls of <hi>Glencairn,</hi> and <hi>Cassillis,</hi> the
Lords <hi>Maxwell, Sommervell, Oliphant, Gray,</hi> and <hi>Oliver

                  </gap>th,</hi> where he was a
Prisoner upon his parole, <hi>Cranmer</hi> studied to free him from the
darkness and fetters of Popery; in which he was so successful, that the other
was afterwards a great Promoter of the Reformation in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The
<hi>Scots</hi> had been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to possessed with most extraordinary prejudices
against the Changes that had been made in <hi>England</hi>: which concurring
with the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Animosities between the two Nations, had raised a wonderful
ill opinion of the Kings proceedings. And though the Bishop of St.
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> (<hi>Barlow,</hi>) had been sent into <hi>Scotland</hi> with
the Book of the <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a Christian Man,</hi> to clear these ill
impressions; yet his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were unsuccessful. The Pope, at the instance
of the <hi>French</hi> King, and to make that Kingdom sure, made <hi>David
Beaton,</hi> Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> a Cardinal; which gave him
great Authority in the Kingdom: so he with the rest of the Clergy diverted the
King from any correspondence with <hi>England,</hi> and assured him of Victory
if he would make War on such an Heretical Prince. The Clergy also of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the
King 50000 Crowns a-year, towards a War with <hi>England</hi>; and possessed
all the Nation with very ill thoughts of the Court and Clergy there. But the
Lords that were now Prisoners, (chiefly the Earl of <hi>Cassillis,</hi> who was
best instructed by his Religious Host;) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a better opinion of the
Reformation; and carried home with them those seeds of knowledg, which produced
afterwards a very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Harvest. On all these things I have dwelt the
longer, that it might appear, whence the inclination of the <hi>Scotish</hi>
Nobility to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, did take its first rise, though there was afterwards in
the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods by which it was advanced, too great a mixture of the heat and
forwardness that is natural to the Genius of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>When the news of the King of <hi>Scotlands</hi> death, and of the
young Queens birth that succeeded him, came to the Court, the King thought this
a very favourable conjuncture to unite and settle the whole Island. But that
unfortunate Princess was not born under such happy Stars, though she was Mother
to him, in whom this long-desired Union took effect. The Lords that were then
Prisoners began the <pb n="321" facs="tcp:104314:185"/> motion; and that being told the
King,<note place="margin">1543.</note> he called for them to
<hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court,</hi> in the Christmas-time; and said now an opportunity was
put in their hands, to quiet all troubles that had been between these two
Crowns, by the Marriage of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to their young Queen:
In which he desired their assistance, and gave them their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they
leaving hostages for the performance of what was then offered by them. They all
promised their Concurrence, and seemed much taken with the greatness of the
<hi>English</hi> Court, which the King always kept up, not without affectation:
they also said, they thought God was better served there than in their own
Countrey. So on New-years-day they took their journey towards
<hi>Scotland</hi>; but the sequel of this will appear afterwards.</p>
            <p>A Parliament was summoned to meet the two and twentieth of
<hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> which sate to the 12th of <hi>May.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1543.</note> So the Session begun in the 34th and ended in the
35th year of the Kings Reign; from whence it is called in the Records, the
Parliament of the 34th and 35th year. Here both the Temporality and
Spirituality gave great Subsidies to the King, of six shillings in the Pound,
to be paid in three years.<note place="margin">A new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> They set
forth in their Preambles, 
<q>The expence the King had been at, in his War with
  <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for his other great and urgent occasions, by which was
  meant a War with <hi>France,</hi> which broke out the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Summer.</q>
But with these, there passed other two Acts of great importance to Religion.
The Title of the first was, <hi>An Act for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of True Religion,
and abolishment of the contrary.</hi> The King was now entring upon a War; so
it seemed reasonable to qualifie the severity of the late Acts about Religion,
that all might be quiet at home. <hi>Cranmer</hi> moved it first;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cranmer</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> and was faintly
seconded by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Worcester, Hereford, Chichester,</hi> and
<hi>Rochester,</hi> who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to stick to him in it. At this time a
League was almost fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed between the King and the Emperour, which did again
raise the Spirits of the Popish Faction. They had been much cast down ever
since the last Queens fall. But now that the Emperor was like to have an
Interest in <hi>English</hi> Councils, they took heart again; and
<hi>Gardiner</hi> opposed the Arch-Bishops motion with all possible
earnestness. And that whole Faction fell so upon it, that the timorous Bishops
not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forsook <hi>Cranmer,</hi> but <hi>Heath</hi> of <hi>Rochester,</hi>
and <hi>Skip</hi> of <hi>Hereford,</hi> were very earnest with him to stay for
a better opportunity: But he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously preferred his Conscience to those arts
of Policy, which he would never practise; and said, he would push it as far as
it would go. So he plied the King, and the other Lords so earnestly, that at
length the Bill passed, though clogg'd with many Provisoes, and very much short
of what he had designed.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>The Preamble set forth, that there being many dissensions about
  Religion, the Scriptures,<note place="margin">An Act

  had put into the hands of his People, were abused by many seditious persons, in
  their Sermons, Books, Playes, Rithmes, and Songs: from which great
  Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were like to arise. For preventing these, it was necessary to
  e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish a Form of sincere Doctrine, conformable to that which was taught by
  the Apostles. Therefore all the Books of the Old and New Testament, of
  <hi>Tindals</hi> Translation (which is called <hi>Crafty, False,</hi> and
  <hi>Vntrue,</hi>) are forbidden to be kept o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> used, in the Kings Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: <pb n="322" facs="tcp:104314:186"/> with all
  other Books, contrary to the Doctrine set forth in the year 1540. with
  Punishments and Fines, and Imprisonment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such as sold or kept such Books.
  But Bibles that were not of <hi>Tindals</hi> Translation were still to be kept,
  only the Annotations, or Preambles, that were in any of them, were to be cut
  out, or dashed; and the Kings Proclamations, and Injunctions, with the Primmers
  and other Books Printed in <hi>English,</hi> for the instruction of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
  before the year 1540, were still to be in force: and among these,
  <hi>Chancers</hi> Books are by name mentioned. No Books were to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
  about Religion, without the Kings Allowance. In no Playes, nor Enterludes, they
  might make any Expositions of Scripture; but only reproach Vice, and set forth
  virtue in them. None might read the Scripture in any open Assembly, or expound
  it; but he who was Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed by the King or his Ordinary; with a Proviso, that
  the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors in Parliament, Judges, Recorders, or any others, who were wont
  in publick occasions to make Speeches, and commonly took a place of Scripture
  for their Text, might still do as they had done formerly. Every Noble-man, or
  Gentle-man, might cause the Bible to be read to him, in or about his House,
  quietly and without disturbance. Every Merchant that was a Housholder, might
  also read it. But no Woman, nor Artificers, Apprentices, Journeymen,
  Serving-men, under the degree of Yeomen; nor no Husbandmen, or Labourers, might
  read it. Yet every Noble Woman, or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, might read it for her self:
  and so might all other persons, but those who were excepted. Every person might
  read and teach in their Houses, the Book set out in the year 1540. with the
  Psalter, Primmer, Paternoster, the Ave, and the Creed in <hi>English.</hi> All
  Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual persons, who preached or taught contrary to the Doctrine set forth
  in that Book, were to be admitted, for the first conviction, to renounce their
  errors; for the second to abjure, and carry a Faggot; which if they refused to
  do, or fell into a third offence, they were to be burnt. But the Laity, for the
  third offence, were only to forfeit their Goods and Chattels, and be liable to
  perpetual Imprisonment. But these offences were to be objected to them, within
  a year after they were committed. And whereas before, the Party accused was not
  allowed to bring Witnesses for his own Purgation; this was now granted him. But
  to this a severe Proviso was added, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to overthrow all the former
  favour; that the Act of the six Articles was still in the same force, in which
  it was before the making of this Act. Yet that was moderated by the next
  Proviso; That the King might at any time hereafter at his pleasure change this
  Act or any Provision in it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This last Proviso was made stronger by another Act, made for the
due execution of Proclamations, in pursuance of a former Act to the same
effect, of which mention was made in the 31st year of the Kings Reign. By that
former Act there was so great a number of Officers of State, and of the Kings
Houshold, of Judges, and other persons, to sit on these Trials, that those not
being easily brought together, the Act had never taken any effect. Therefore it
was now appointed, that nine Counsellors should be a sufficient number for
these Trials. At the passing of that Act the Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> protested
against it, which <pb n="323" facs="tcp:104314:186"/> is the single Instance of a
Protestation against any publick Bill, through this Kings whole Reign.</p>
            <p>The Act about Religion, freed the Subjects from the fears under
which they were before. For now the Laity were delivered from the hazard of
burning; and the Spirituality were not in danger, but upon the third
Conviction. They might also bring their own witnesses, which was a great favour
to them. Yet that high power which was given the King, of altering the Act or
any parts of it, made, that they were not absolutely secured from their fears,
of which some instances af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appeared. But as this Act was some
mitigation of former severities, so it brought the Reformers to depend wholly
on the Kings Mercy, for their Lives: since he could now chain up, or let loose,
the Act of the six Articles upon them, at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>Soon after the end of this Parliament,<note place="margin">A League
  between the King and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</note> a League was sworn between the King and
the Emperour, on Trinity Sunday; Offensive, and Defensive, for <hi>England,
Calais,</hi> and the places about it, and for all <hi>Flanders</hi>; with many
other particulars, to be found in the Treaty set down at large by the Lord
<hi>Herbert.</hi> There is no mention made of the Legitimation of the Lady
<hi>Mary</hi>; but it seems it was promised, that she should be declared next
in the Succession of the Crown, to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> if the King had no
other Children; which was done in the next Parliament, without any reflections
on her Birth; and the Emperor was content to accept of that, there being no
other terms to be obtained. The Popish party, who had set up their rest on
bringing the King and Emperour to a League, and putting the Lady <hi>Mary</hi>
into the Succession, no doubt prest the Emperor much to accept of this: which
we may reasonably believe was vigorously driven on by <hi>Bonner,</hi> who was
sent to <hi>Spain,</hi> an Ambassador for concluding this Peace, by which also
the Emperor gained much; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving engaged the Crowns of <hi>England,</hi>
and <hi>France</hi> in a War, and drawn off the King of <hi>England</hi> from
his League with the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> he was now at more leisure to
prosecute his designs in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the negotiation in <hi>Scotland</hi> succeeded not to the
Kings mind, though at first there were very good appearances. The Cardinal, by
forging a Will for the dead King,<note place="margin">A Treaty for a match with
  the Queen of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> got himself and some of his party to be
put into the Government. But the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> (<hi>Hamilton,</hi>)
being the nearest in blood to the young Queen, and being generally beloved for
his Probity, was invited to assume the Government: which he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with great
moderation, and an universal applause. He summoned a Parliament which confirmed
him in his Power, during the Minority of the Queen. The King sent Sir <hi>Ralph
Sadler</hi> to him, to agree the Marriage, and to desire him to send the young
Queen into <hi>England.</hi> And if private ends wrought much on him,
<hi>Sadler</hi> was empowered to offer another Marriage of the Kings second
Daughter, the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> to his Son. The Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>
was himself inclinable to Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and very much hated the Cardinal. So he
was easily brought to consent to a Treaty for the Match, which was concluded in
<hi>August.</hi> By which the young Queen was to be bred in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
till she was ten years of age: but the King might send a Nobleman, and his
Wife, with other persons, not exceeding 20, to wait on her. And for
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this, six Noblemen were to be sent from <hi>Scotland</hi> for
Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages. The Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> being then Governor, kept the Cardinal 
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:104314:187"/> under restraint till this Treaty was Concluded: But he,
corrupting his Keepers made his escape, and joyning with the Queen Mother, they
made a strong faction against the Governor; all the Clergy joyned with the
Cardinal to oppose the Match with <hi>England,</hi> since they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for
ruine if it succeeded. The Queen, being a sister of <hi>Guise,</hi> and bred in
the <hi>French</hi> Court, was wholly for their Interests; and all that had
been obliged by that Court, or depended on it, were quickly drawn into the
Party. It was also said to every body, that it was much more the Interest of
<hi>Scotland</hi> to match with <hi>France,</hi> than with <hi>England.</hi> If
they were united to <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Interests
  there.</note> they might expect an easie Government. For the <hi>French</hi>
being at such distance from them, and knowing how easily they might throw
themselves into the Armes of <hi>England,</hi> would certainly rule them
gently, and avoid giving them great Provocations. But if they were united to
<hi>England,</hi> they had no remedy, but must look for an heavier yoke to be
laid on them. This meeting with the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Antipathy, that by a long
continuance of War, was grown up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them to a savage hatred of the
<hi>English</hi> Nation; and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by the considerations of Religion,
raised an universal dislike of the Match with <hi>England,</hi> in the greatest
part of the whole Nation; only a few men of greater Probity, who were weary of
the depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Wars in the Borders, and had a liking to the Reformation
of the Church, were still for it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Court struck in vigorously with their Party in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and sent over the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi>; who, as he was
next in blood to the Crown,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> party
  pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails.</note> after the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> so was of the same family
of the <hi>Stewarts,</hi> which had endeared him to the late King. He was to
lead the Queens party against the <hi>Hamiltons.</hi> Yet they employed another
Tool, which was <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> base Brother to the Governor, who was
afterwards Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> He had great power over his
Brother, who being then not above four and twenty years of age, and having been
the only lawful Son of his Father in his old age, was never bred abroad: and so
understood not the Policies and arts of Courts, and was easily abused by his
base Brother. He assured him, that if he went about to destroy Religion, by
matching the Queen to an Heretical Prince, they would depose him from his
Government, and declare him Illegitimate. There could be indeed nothing clearer
than his Fathers Divorce from his first Wife. For it had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved,
that she had been married to the Lord <hi>Yesters</hi> Son, before he married
her, who claimed her as his Wife; upon which, her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Earl of
<hi>Arran</hi> was declared Null in the year 1507. And it was ten years after,
that the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> did Marry the Governors Mother: Of which things
the Original Instruments are yet extant. Yet it was now said that that
Precontract with the Lord <hi>Yesters</hi> Son was but a forgery, to dissolve
that Marriage: and if the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> (who was next to the Crown,
in case the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> was Illegitimated,) should by the assistance
of <hi>France</hi> procure a review of that Process from <hi>Rome,</hi> and
obtain a Revocation of that Sentence, by which his Fathers first Marriage was
annulled; then it was plain that the second marriage, with the issue by it,
would be of no force. All this wrought on the Governor much, and at length drew
him off from the Match with <hi>England,</hi> and brought him over to the
<hi>French</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:104314:187"/> Interests. Which being effected, there was no
further use of the Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l of L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nnox; so he finding himself neglected,
by the Queen, and the Cardinal, and abandoned by the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
fled into <hi>England</hi>: where he was very kindly received by the King, who
gave him in marriage his Neece, Lady <hi>Margaret Dowglass,</hi> whom the Queen
of <hi>Scotland</hi> had born to the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> her second
Husband. From which Marriage issued the Lord <hi>Darnly</hi> Father to King
<hi>Iames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Lords of the <hi>French</hi> Faction had carried things
to their mind in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was next considered, what they should do
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the Hostages whom the Lords, who were Prisoners in <hi>England,</hi>
had left behind them. And for this, no other Remedy could be found, but to let
them take their hazard; and leave them to the King of <hi>England</hi>'s mercy:
To this they all agreed, only the Earl of <hi>Cassilis</hi> had too much Honour
and Vertue to do so mean a thing. Therefore, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had done all he could
for maintaining the Treaty about the Match, he went into <hi>England,</hi> and
offered himself again to be a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner. But as generous actions are a reward
to themselves, so they often meet with that entertainment which they deserve.
And upon this occasion, the King was not wanting to express a very great value
for that Lord. He called him another <hi>Regulus,</hi> but used him better. For
he both gave him his Liberty, and made him noble Presents, and sent him and his
Hostages back, being resolved to have a severer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the injury done
him. All which I have opened more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because this will give a great light
to the affairs of that Kingdom: which will be found in the Reigns of the
succeeding Princes, to have a great intermixture with the affairs of this
Kingdom. Nor are they justly represented by any who write of these times; and
having seen some Original Papers relating to <hi>Scotland</hi> at that time, I
have done it upon more certain information.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> made War next upon <hi>France</hi>:
The grounds of this War are recited by the Lord <hi>Herbert.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A War with <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> One of these is proper for me
to repeat; 
<q>That the <hi>French</hi> King had not deserted the Bishop of
  <hi>Rome,</hi> and consented to a Reformation, as he had once Promised. The
  rest related to other things, such as the seizing our Ships; The detaining the
  yearly Pension due to the King; The Fortifying <hi>Ardres</hi> to the prejudice
  of the <hi>English</hi> pale; The revealing the Kings secrets to the Emperor;
  The having given, first his Daughter, and then the Duke of <hi>Guises</hi>
  Sister, in Marriage, to his Enemy, the King of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and his
  confederating himself with the Turk. And Satisfaction not being given in these
  particulars a War is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Iuly</hi> the King married <hi>Katharine Parre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A new perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</note> who had been formerly
married to <hi>Nevil</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer.</hi> She was a secret Favourer of
the Reformation; yet could not divert a storm, which at this time fell on some
in <hi>Windsor.</hi> For that being a place to which the King did oft retire,
it was thought fit to make some examples there. And now the League with the
Emperour, gave the Popish Faction a greater inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in the Kings Counsels.
There was at this time a Society at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> that favoured the
Reformation. <hi>Anthony Person</hi> a Priest, <hi>Robert Testwood,</hi> and
<hi>Iohn Marbeck</hi> Singing Men, and <hi>Henry Filmer</hi> of the Town of

<hi>Gardiner,</hi> by whose means he was made a Prebendary there. And to shew
how dextrously he could make his Court both ways, or to make compensation for
what he had formerly done, he took care to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a whole Book of
Informations, against these in <hi>Windsor,</hi> who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the <hi>New
Learning,</hi> (which was the modest phrase by which they termed the
Reformation.) He carried this Book to <hi>Gardiner,</hi> who moved the King in
Council, that a Commission might be granted for searching suspected Houses at
<hi>Windsor,</hi> in which it was Informed there were many Books against the
six Articles. The King granted the Warrant for the Town, but not for the
Castle. So those before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, were seized on, and some of these Books were
found in their houses. Dr. <hi>Hains,</hi> Dean of <hi>Exceter,</hi> and
Prebendary of <hi>Windsor,</hi> being informed against, was also put in Prison;
so was likewise Sir <hi>Philip Hobby.</hi> But there were likewise some Papers
of Notes on the Bible, and of a Concordance in <hi>English,</hi> found in
<hi>Marbecks</hi> house, written with his own hand: and he being an Illiterate
man, they did not doubt but these were other mens works, which he was writing
out. So they began with him, and hoped to draw discoveries from him. He was
frequently examined, but would tell nothing that might do hurt to any other
person. But being Examined, who wrote these Notes, he said they were his own:
for he read all the Books he could light on, and wrote out what every man had
written on any place of Scripture. And for his Concordance, he told them, that
being a poor man, he could not buy one of the Bibles, when they came first out
in <hi>English,</hi> but set himself to write one out: by which another
perceiving his Industry, suggested to him, that he would do well to write a
Concordance in <hi>English</hi>; but he said, he knew not what that was: so the
other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son explaining it to him, he got a <hi>Latin</hi> Concordance, and an
<hi>English</hi> Bible; and having learned a little <hi>Latin,</hi> when he was
young, he, by comparing the <hi>English</hi> with the <hi>Latin,</hi> had drawn
out a Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,<note place="margin">

                  </gap> great ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</note> which he had brought to the Letter L.
This seemed so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant a thing to <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and the other Bishops
that examined him, that they could by no means believe it. But he desired they
would draw out any words of the letter M. and give him the <hi>Latin</hi>
Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, with the <hi>English</hi> Bible, and after a little time they
should see whether he had not done the rest. So the Trial was made, and in a
dayes time he had drawn out three sheets of Paper, upon those words that were
given him. This both satisfyed, and astonished the Bishops, wondering at the
Ingeniousness and diligence of so poor a man. It was much talked of, and being
told the King, he said <hi>Marbeck employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his time better than those that
examined him.</hi> For the others, they were kept in Prison at <hi>London,</hi>
till the 24th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> that the King gave orders to try them at

Epistle of <hi>Calvins</hi> against it; which, he said, he copied before the
Act of the six Articles was made. The Jury was not called out of the Town, for
they would not trust it to them, but out of the Farms of the Chappel. They were
all found guilty, and so condemned to be burnt, which was Executed on three of
them the next day: only <hi>Marbeck</hi> was recommended to the Bishop of
<hi>Winchesters</hi> care, to procure his Pardon, which was obtained. The other
three expressed great composure of mind in their Sufferings, and dyed with much
Christian Resolution and Patience; forgiving their persecutors, and committing
themselves to the Mercies of God through <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in their Tryal, Doctor <hi>London,</hi> and

Lawyer and an Informer, had studied to fish out accusations against many of the
Kings Servants, as Sir <hi>Philip Hobby,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Cardine,</hi>
with their Ladies, and several others who had favoured those men. With these
Informations, <hi>Okam,</hi> that had been the Clerk of the Court, was sent to
<hi>Gardiner</hi>: But one of the Queens servants who had discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the
design, was before him at Court. Upon the advertisement which he had brought,
<hi>Okam</hi> was seized on at his coming to Court, and all his Papers were
examined; in which they discovered a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy against those Gentlemen, with
other Plots, that gave the King great Offence; but the particulars are not
mentioned. So Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Simmonds</hi> were sent for, and
examined upon this desertion. But they, not knowing that their Letters were
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, denyed there was any such Plot; and being put to their Oaths,
swore it. Then their own hand-writing was produced against them. Upon which,
they being thus Perjured, were ordered to be carryed on Horse-back, with their
faces to the Horse tailes, and Papers on their Foreheads, for their perjury;
and then to be set in the Pillory, both in <hi>Windsor, Reading,</hi> and
<hi>Newbury,</hi> where the King was at that time. This was accordingly
executed on them; but sunk so deep in Doctor <hi>Londons</hi> heart, that he
dyed soon after. From all this it will appear what sort of men the Persecutors
at that time were.</p>
            <p>But this was a small part of what <hi>Gardiner</hi> had
Projected:<note place="margin">A Conspiracy against <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
               </note> For
he looked on these, as persons unworthy of his displeasure. <hi>Cranmer</hi>
was chiefly aimed at by him. And therefore all that party were still infusing
it into the Kings mind, that it was great Injustice to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute poor men with
so much severity, and let the chief Supporter of Heresie stand in so eminent a
degree, and in such favour about him. At length the King, to discover the
bottom of their designs, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give ear to their accusations, and desired
to hear what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars could be objected against him. This gave them great
encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; for till that time, the King would let nothing be said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Cranmer.</hi> So they concluded he would be quickly ruined, since the King
had opened his ear to their Informations. Therefore many particulars were
quickly laid together, and put into the Kings hands; who a little after that,

to condemn those as Hereticks, who stood for the Word of God, against humane
Inventions. But after some discourse, the King told him he was the man, who, as
he was informed, was the chief Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager of Heresie; and then gave him the
Articles that were brought against him, and his Chaplains, both by some

<hi>Kent.</hi> When he read them, he kneeled down, and desired the King would
put the matter to a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. He acknowledged he was still of the same mind he
was of, when he opposed the Six Articles; but that he had done nothing against
them. Then the King asked him about his Wife. He frankly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed he had a
Wife; but said, That he had sent her to <hi>Germany,</hi> upon the passing the
Act against Priests having Wives. His candor and simplicity wrought so on the
King, that he discovered to him the whole Plot that was laid against him; and
said, That instead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to any Tryal about it, he would have him
try it out, and proceed against those his Accusers. But he excused himself, and
said it would not be decent for him to sit Judge in his own Cause. But the King
said to him, he was resolved none other should Judge it, but those he should
name. So he named his Chancellor, and his Register; to whom the King added
another: And a Commission be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given them, they went into <hi>Kent,</hi> and
sate three weeks to find out the first Contrivers of this Accusation. And now
every one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned it, since they saw he was still firmly rooted in the Kings
esteem and favour. But it being observed, that the Commissioners proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
faintly, <hi>Cranmers</hi> friends moved that some man of Courage and
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, might be sent thither to canvass this Accusation more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
So Doctor <hi>Lee</hi> Dean of <hi>York,</hi> was brought up about
<hi>All-hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tid,</hi> and sent
into <hi>Kent.</hi> And he, who had been well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Arts of
discovering secrets, when he was one of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors of the Abbeys, managed it
more vigorously. He ordered a search to be made of all suspected persons; among
whose Papers, Letters were found, both from the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Lon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> and some
of those whom <hi>Cranmer</hi> had treated with the greatest freedom and
kindness, in which the whole Plot against him was discovered. But it was now
near the Session of Parliament: and the King was satisfied with the discovery,
but thought it not fit to make much noise of it. And he received no addresses
from the Arch-Bishop to prosecute it further:<note place="margin">His Christian

noted for his Clemency, and following our Saviours Rule, of <hi>Doing good for
evil,</hi> that it was commonly said, The way to get his favour, was to do him
an injury. These were the only Instances in which he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed 
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:104314:189"/> his resentments. Two of the Conspirators against
him,<note place="margin">1544.</note> had been persons signally obliged by him:
The one was the Bishop Suffragan of <hi>Dover</hi>; the other was a Civilian,
whom he had imployed much in his business. But all the notice he took of it,
was to shew them their Letters, and to admonish them to be more faithful and
honest for the future. Upon which he freely forgave them, and carryed it so to
them afterwards, as if he had absolutely forgotten what they had contrived
against him. And a person of Quality coming to him about that time, to obtain
his favour and assistance in a Sute, in which he was to move the King, he went
about it, and had almost procured it: but the King calling to mind, that he had
been one of his secret accusers, asked him whether he took him for his friend;
he answered that he did so. Then the King said, the other was a Knave, and was
his mortal Enemy; and bid him, when he should see him next, call him a Knave to
his Face. <hi>Cranmer</hi> answered, that such Language did not become a
Bishop. But the King sullenly commanded him to do it; yet his modesty was such,
that he could not obey so harsh a Command. And so he passed the matter over.
When these things came to be known, all persons, that were not unjustly
prejudiced against him, acknowledged that his behaviour was sutable to the
Example and Doctrine of the meek and lowly Saviour of the World: And very well
became so great a Bishop, and such a Reformer of the Christian Religion; who in
those sublime and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Instances practised that which he taught
others to do. The year in which this fell out is not exprest by those who have
record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; but by the concurring circumstances, I judge it likeliest to have
been done this year.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, the Parliament met, that was Summoned to meet the

  against the Popes Supremacy, and for maintaining the Succession in all points
  according to this Act: which whosoever refused to take, was to be adjudged a
  Traitor; and whosoever should, either in words, or by writing, say any thing
  contrary to this Act, or to the peril and slander of the Kings heirs, limited
  in the Act, was to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged a Traitor.</q> This was done, no doubt, upon a

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:104314:190"/> how much this lessened the Prerogative,<note place="margin">1542.</note> and the Right of Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, will be easily

            <p>There was another Bill about the qualifying of the Act of the six
Articles, that was sent divers times from the one House to the other. It was
brought to the Lords the 1st of <hi>March,</hi> and read the first time; and
stuck till the 4th, when it was read the second time; on the 5th it was read
the third time, and passed, and was sent down to the Commons, with <hi>words to
be put in, or put out of it.</hi> On the 6th, the Commons sent it up with some
alterations: And on the 8th, the Lords sent it down again to the Commons: where
it lay till the 17th, and then it was sent up with their agreement. And the
Kings Assent was given by his Letters Patents on the 29th of
<hi>March.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act against Conspiracies.</note> The Preamble
was, 
<q>That whereas untrue accusations, and presentments, might be
  maliciously contrived against the Kings Subjects, and kept secret till a time
  were espied to have them by malice convicted: Therefore it was Enacted, That
  none should be Endited, but upon a presentment by the Oaths of twelve men, to
  at least, three of the Commissioners appointed by the King: and that none
  should be Imprisoned, but upon an Enditement, except by a special Warrant from
  the King, and that all Presentments should be made within one year after the
  Offences were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and if words were uttered in a Sermon, contrary to
  the Statute, they must be complained of within forty dayes, unless a just cause
  were given why it could not be so soon: Admitti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  have in any other case of Felony.</q> This Act has clearly a Relation to the
Conspiracies mentioned the former year, both against the Arch-Bishop, and some
of the Kings Servants.</p>
            <p>Another Act passed, continuing some former Acts for revising the
Canon-Law, and for drawing up such a body of Ecclesiastical Laws, as should
have Authority in <hi>England.</hi> This <hi>Cranmer</hi> pressed often with
great vehemence; and to shew the necessity of it, drew out a short Extract of
some passages in the Canon-Law, (which the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will find in the
Collection,) to shew how undecent a thing it was,<note place="margin">Collect.
  <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.</note> to let a Volume, in which such Laws were, be studyed
or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered any longer in <hi>England.</hi> Therefore he was earnest to have
such a Collection of Ecclesiastical Laws made, as might regulate the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Courts. But it was found more for the greatness of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and the
Authority of the Civil Courts, to keep that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined; so he could never
obtain his desire during this Kings Reign.</p>
            <p>Another Act passed in this Parliament for the remission of a Loan
of Money, which the King had raised. This is almost copied out of an Act to the
same effect, that passed in the twenty first year of the Kings Reign: with this
addition, That by this Act, those who had got payment, either in whole, or in
part, of the Sums so lent the King, were to repay it back to the Exchequer. All
business being finished, and a general pardon passed, with the ordinary
exceptions of some Crimes, among which, Heresie is one, the Parliament was 
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:104314:190"/> Prorogued on the 29th of <hi>March,</hi> to the 4th of

            <p>The King had now a War both with <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Scotland</hi> upon him. And therefore to prepare for it, he both enhanced
the value of Money, and embased it: for which, he that writes his vindication
gives this for the reason; That the Coin being generally embased all over
<hi>Europe,</hi> he was forced to do it, lest otherwise all the Money should
have gone out of the Kingdom. He resolved to begin the War with
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and sent an Army by Sea thither,<note place="margin">The Wars

<hi>Hartford,</hi> (afterwards Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi>) who landing at
<hi>Grantham,</hi> a little above <hi>Leith,</hi> burnt, and spoiled,
<hi>Leith,</hi> and <hi>Edenburgh</hi>; in which they found more riches than
they thought could possibly have been there; and they went through the
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, burning and spoiling it every-where, till they came to
<hi>Berwick.</hi> But they did too much if they intended to gain the hearts of
that people, and too little if they intended to subdue them. For as they
besieged not the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which would have cost them more
time, and trouble; so they did not fortifie <hi>Leith,</hi> nor leave a
Garrison in it, which was such an inexcusable Omission, that it seems their
Counsels were very weak and ill laid. For <hi>Leith</hi> being fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and
a Fleet kept going between it and <hi>Berwick</hi> or <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> the
Trade of the Kingdom must have been quite stopt, <hi>Edinburgh</hi> ruined, the

forced to submit to the King. But the spoils this Army made, had no other
effect, but to enrage the Kingdom, and unite them so entirely to the

the Western parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where his Power lay, he could get none

            <p>The King was now to cross the Seas: but, before he went, he
stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to settle the matters of Religion, so that both Parties might have
some content. <hi>Audley</hi> the Chancellor dying, he made the Lord
<hi>Wrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesley,</hi> that had been Secretary, and was of the Popish Party,
Lord Chancellor; but made Sir <hi>William Petre,</hi> that was
<hi>Cranmers</hi> great friend, Secretary of State. He also committed the
Government of the Kingdom in his absence, to the Queen, to whom he joyned the
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord Chancellor, the Earl of
<hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Petre.</hi> And if there was need of any
Force to be raised, he appointed the Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi> his Lieutenant;
under whose Government the Reformers needed not fear any thing. But he did
another Act, that did wonderfully please that whole Party, which was, the

opening his ears to motions for Reformation, to which they had been shut now
about six years: And therefore they looked that more things of

            <p>Things being thus setled at home, the King having sent his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

               <note place="margin">1545.</note>
that so he might drive the <hi>English</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> intended
first to make himself Master of the Sea. And he set out a great Fleet of an
hundred and fifty greater Ships, and sixty lesser ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many Gallies
brought from the Streights. The King set out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hundred Ships. On both
sides these were only Merchant Ships that were hired for this War. But after
the <hi>French</hi> Fleet had looked on <hi>England,</hi> and attempted to Land
with ill success, both in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and in <hi>Sussex,</hi>
and had engaged in a Sea-fight for some hours; they returned back without any
considerable action: Nor did they any thing at Land. But the Kings Fleet went
to <hi>Normandy,</hi> where they made a descent, and burnt the Countrey. So
that this year was likewise glorious to the King. The Emperor had now done what
he long designed: And therefore being courted by both Crowns, he undertook a
Mediation, that under the Colour of Mediating a peace, he might the more
effectually keep up the War.</p>
            <p>The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> saw what mischief was designed
against them.<note place="margin">The <hi>German</hi>

<hi>Trent</hi> was now opened, and was condemning their Doctrine. A League was
also concluded between the Pope and the Emperor, for procuring Obedience to
their Canons and Decrees: And an Army was raising. The Emperor was also setting
on foot old quarrels with some of the Princes: A firm Peace was concluded with
the <hi>Turk.</hi> So that if the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France</hi> were not brought to an Agreement, they were undone. They sent
Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, to both Courts to mediate a Peace. With them <hi>Cranmer</hi>
joyned his endeavours, but he had not a <hi>Cromwel</hi> in the Court, to
manage the Kings temper; who was so provoked with the ill Treatment he had
received from <hi>France,</hi> that he would not come to an Agreement:

<hi>France</hi> against him, if he made any further Innovation in Religion.
This diverted the King from it; and in <hi>August</hi> this year the only great

continued in the height of favor; which was always kept up, not only by an
agreement of humours between the King and him, but by the constant success
which followed him in all his exploits. He was a Favourer of the Reformation,
as far as could consist with his interest at Court, which he never endangered
upon any account.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Cranmer</hi> was left alone, without friend or support.
Yet he had gained one great Preferment in the Church, to a man of his own mind.

<hi>Litchfield, Day</hi> that was a Moderate man, and inclinable to

greater Party among the Bishops than at any time before.</p>
            <p>But though there were no great Transactions about Religion in
<hi>England</hi> this year, there were very remarkable things done in

            <p>Mr. <hi>George Wishart</hi> was descended of a Noble Family; he

               </gap>se parts. But the
Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal offended at this, sent a threatning Message to the Magistrates; upon
which one of them, as <hi>Wishart</hi> ended one of his Sermons,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Spotswood.</hi>
               </note> was so obsequious as to forbid him to
Preach any more among them, or give them any further trouble: to whom he
answered, 
<q>That God knew he had no design to trouble them, but for them to
  reject the Messengers of God, was not the way to escape trouble; when he was
  gone, God would send Messengers of another sort among <pb facs="tcp:104314:192"/> them. He
  had to the hazard of his Life, Preached the word of Salvation to them, and they
  had now rejected him: but if it was long well with them, he was not led by the
  Spirit of Truth; and if unlooked for trouble fell on them, he bade them
  remember this was the Cause of it, and turn to God by Repentance.</q> From
thence he went to the Western parts, where he was also much followed. But the
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> giving order, that he should not be admitted
to Preach in Churches, he Preached often in the fields: and when in some places
his followers would have forced the Churches, he checkt them and said, it was
the word of Peace that he Preached, and therefore no blood should be shed about
it: But after he had stayed a month there, he heard that there was a great
Plague in <hi>Dundee,</hi> which broke out the fourth day after he had left it:
upon which, he presently returned thither and Preached oft to them, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over one of the Gates, having taken care that the Infected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons should
stand without, and those that were clean within the Gate. He continued among
them and took care to supply the poor, and to visit the sick, and do all the
Offices of a faithful Pastor in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. Once as he ended his Sermon, a
Priest coming to have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, was taken with the weapon in his hand, but
when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were rushing furiously on him, <hi>Wishart</hi> got him in his
Arms and saved him from their rage, for he said he had done no harm, only they
saw what they might look for. He became a little after this more than ordinary
serious and apprehensive of his end: he was seen sometimes to rise in the
night, and spend the greatest part of it in Prayer; and he often warned his
hearers, that his Sufferings were at hand, but that few should suffer after
him, and that the Light of true Religion should be spread over the whole Land.
He went to a great many places, where his Sermons were well received, and came
last to <hi>Lothian,</hi> where he found a greater neglect of the Gospel, than
in other parts, for which he threatned them, <hi>That Strangers should chace
them from their dwellings and possess them.</hi> He was Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Gentleman
of Qualities house <hi>Cockburn</hi> of <hi>Ormeston,</hi> when in the night
the house was beset by some horsemen, who were sent by the Cardinals means to
take him. The Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi> that had the chief Jurisdiction in the
County, was with them, who promising that no hurt should be done him, he caused
the Gate to be opened, saying, <hi>The Blessed Will of God be done.</hi> When
he presented himself to the Earl of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> he desired to be
proceeded with according to Law, for he said, he feared less to die openly,
than to be Murdered in secret. The Earl promised upon his honour, that no harm
should be done him: and for some time seemed resolved, to have made his words
good, but the Queen Mother and Cardinal in end prevailed with him, to put
<hi>Wishart</hi> in their hands, and they sent him to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
where it was agreed to make a Sacrifice of him. Upon this the Cardinal called a
meeting of the Bishops to St. <hi>Andrews</hi> against the 27th of
<hi>February,</hi> to destroy him with the more Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but the Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Glasgow</hi> moved, that there should be a Warrant procured from the
Lord Governour for their proceedings. To this the Cardinal consented, thinking
the Governour was then so linked to their Interests, that he would deny them
nothing: but the <pb n="335" facs="tcp:104314:192"/> Governor bearing in his heart a secret
love to Religion, and being plainly dealt with by a Noble Gentleman of his
name, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <hi>Preston,</hi> who
laid before him the just and terrible Judgments of God he might look for, if he
suffered poor Innocents to be so Murdered at the appetite of the Clergy; sent
the Cardinal word not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed till he himself came, and that he would not
consent to his death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till the cause was well examined; and that if the
Cardinal proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against him, his blood should be required at his hands. But
the Cardinal resolved to go on at his peril, for he apprehended, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
it, there might be either a Legal or a violent rescue made: so he ordered a
mock Citation of <hi>Wishart</hi> to appear; who being brought the next day to
the Abbey-Church, the Process was opened with a Sermon, in which the Preacher
delivered a great deal of good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning the Scriptures, being the
only Touchstone by which Heresie was to be tryed. After Sermon, the Prisoner
was brought to the Bar: he first fell down on his knees, and after a short
Prayer, he stood up, and gave a long account of his Sermons, That he had
Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing, but what was contained in the ten Commandments, the Apostles
Creed, and the Lords Prayer; but was interrupted with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful words, and
required to answer plainly to the Articles ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to him. Upon which he appealed to an indifferent Judge: he
desired to be tryed by the word of God and before my Lord Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, whose
Prisoner he was: but the Indictment being read, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing and offering to
justifie, most of the Articles objected against him, was Judged an obstinate
Heretick, and Condemned to be burnt. All the next night he spent in Prayer: In
the Morning, two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>riers came to
Confess him, but he said, he would have nothing to do with them, yet if he
could, he would gladly speak with the Learned man, that Preached the day
before. So he being sent to him, after much Conference he asked him, if he
would receive the Sacrament? <hi>Wishart</hi> answered, he would most gladly do
it, if he might have it as Christ had instituted it, under both kinds; but the
Cardinal would not su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he discoursed to those that were present, of the
death of Christ, and the ends of the Sacrament, and then having blessed and
consecrated the Elements, he took the Sacrament himself, and gave it to those
that were with him. That being done, he would taste no other thing, but retired
to his Devotion. Two hours after the Executioners came, and put on him a Coat
of black Linning, full of bags of Powder, and carryed him out to the place of
Execution, which was before the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Castle. He spake a little to the
people, desiring them not to be offended at the good word of God, for the
sufferings that followed it, it was the true Gospel of Christ that he had
Preached, and for which with a most glad heart and mind he now offered up his
Life. The Cardinal was set in state in a great Window of his Castle, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on this sad Spectacle. When <hi>Wishart</hi> was tyed to the Stake, he cryed
aloud, <hi>O Saviour of the World have Mercy upon me!

fire. Thus died this eminent servant and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss of Christ, on whose Sufferings I have enlarged the more,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they proved so fatal to the interests of the Popish Clergy, for not
any one thing hastned forward the Reformation more, than this did, and since he
had both his Education and Ordination in <hi>England,</hi> a full account of
him seems no impertinent Digression.</p>
            <p>The Clergy rejoyced much at his death, and thought (according to
the constant Maxime of all Persecutors) that they should live more at ease, now
when <hi>Wishart</hi> was out of the way. They magnified the Cardinal for
proceeding so vigorously, without, or rather against the Governor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Orders: But the people did universally
look on him as a Martyr, and believed an extraordinary measure of Gods Spirit
had rested on him, since besides great innocency and purity of Life, his
predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions came so oft to pass, that he was believed a Prophet as well as a
Saint: And the Reformation was now so much opened by his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that
was so confirmed by his death that the Nation was generally possessed with the
love of it. The Nobility were mightily offended with the Cardinal, and said
<hi>Wisharts</hi> death was no less than Murder, since the Clergy without a
Warrant from the Secular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, could dispose of no mans Life: So it came
universally to be said, that he now deserved to die by the Law, yet since he
was too great for a Legal Tryal, the Kingdom being under the feeble Government
of a Regency, it was fit private persons should undertake it; and it was given
out, that the killing an Usurper, was always esteemed a commendable Action, and
so in that state of things, they thought secret practices might be justified.
This agreeing so much with the temper of some in that Nation, who had too much
of the heat and forwardness of their Countrey, a few Gentlemen of Quality, who
had been ill used by the Cardinal, conspired his death. He was become generally
hateful to the whole Nation, and the Marriage of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Daughter to the
Earl of <hi>Crawfords</hi> eldest Son, enraged the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility the more against
him; and his carriage towards them all was insolent and provoking. These
offended Gentlemen came to St. <hi>Andrews</hi> the 29th of <hi>May,</hi> and
the next Morning, they and their attendants, being but twelve in all, first
attempted the Gate of his Castle, which they found open, and made it sure; and
though there were no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than an hundred reckoned to be within the Castle,
yet they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the passages of the House, went with very little noise, to
the Servants Chambers, and turned them almost all out of doors; and having thus
made the Castle sure, they went to the Cardinals door. He who till then was
fast asleep, suspecting nothing, perceived at last by their rudeness, that they
were not his friends, and made his door fast against them. So they sent for
fire to set to it, upon which he treated with them, and upon assurance of Life
he opened the door: but they rushing in, did most cruelly and treacherously
Murder him. A Tumult was raised in the Town, and many of his friends came to 
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:104314:193"/> rescue him, but the Conspirators carryed the dead body
and exposed it to their view, in the same Window out of which he had not long
before lookt on, when <hi>Wishart</hi> was burnt, which had been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
censured as a most indecent thing in a Churchman, to deligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in such a Spectacle. But those who
condemned this Action, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Gods Justice in so exemplary a
punishment, and refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting on <hi>Wisharts</hi> last words, were the more
confirmed in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had of his Sanctity. This Fact was differently
censured; some justified it and said, it was only the killing of a mighty
Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, others that were glad he was out of the way, yet condemned the manner
of it, as treacherous and inhumane. And though some of the Preachers did
afterwards fly to that Castle as a Sanctuary, yet none of them, were either
Actors or Consenters to it: it is true they did generally extenuate it, yet I
do not find that any of them justified it. The exemplary and signal ends of
almost all the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, scarce any of them dying an ordinary death, made
all people the more inclined to condemn it. The day after the Cardinal was
kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, about 140 came into the Castle and prepared for a Siege. The House was
well furnished in all things necessary, and it lying so near the Sea, they
expected help from King <hi>Henry,</hi> to whom they sent a Messenger for his
Assistance, and declared for him. So a Siege fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, they were so well
supplyed from <hi>England,</hi> that after five months the Governor was glad to
treat with them, apprehending much the footing the <hi>English</hi> might have,
if those within being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to extremities, should receive a Garrison from
King <hi>Henry</hi>: They had the Governor also more at their mercy, for as the
Cardinal had taken his Eldest Son into his house, under the pretence of
educating him, but really as his Fathers Hostage, designing likewise to infuse
in him a violent hatred of the new Preachers; so the Conspirators finding him
in the Castle, kept him still to help them to better terms. A Treaty being
agreed on, they demanded their pardon for what they had done, together with an
Absolution to be procured from <hi>Rome,</hi> for the killing of the Cardinal;
and that the Castle and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors Son, should remain in their hands, till
the Absolution was brought over. Some of the Preachers apprehending the Clergy
might revenge the Cardinals death on them, were forced to fly into the Castle;
but one of them <hi>Iohn Rough</hi> (who was afterwards burnt in
<hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time) being so offended at the
licentiousness of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were in the Castle, who were a reproach
to that which they pretended to favour, left them, and went away in one of the
ships, that brought Provisions out of <hi>England.</hi> When the Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
came from <hi>Rome,</hi> they excepted to it, for some words in it, that called
the killing of the Cardinal, <hi>Crimen irremissibile,</hi> an unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
crime; by which they said the Absolution gave them no securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, since it was
null, if the Fact could not be pardoned. The truth was, they were encouraged
from <hi>England,</hi> so they refused to stand to the Capitulation, and
rejected the Absolution. But some ships and Souldiers being sent from
<hi>France,</hi> the Castle was besieged at Land, and shut up also by Sea, and
which was worst of all a Plague broke out within it, of which many died. Upon
this no help coming sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly from <hi>England,</hi> they were forced to
deliver up the place on <pb n="338" facs="tcp:104314:194"/> no better terms, than that their
Lives should be spared, but they were to be Banisht <hi>Scotland</hi> and never
to return to it. The Castle was demolished according to the Canon Law, that
appoints all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where any Cardinal is killed to be razed. This was not
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated this year, and not till two years after, only I thought it best to
joyn the whole matter together and set it down all at once</p>
            <p>In <hi>November</hi> following a New Parliament was held: where
toward the expence of the Kings Wars, the Convocation of the Province of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> granted a continuation of the former Subsidy of six
shillings in the pound,<note place="margin">A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sits.</note> to be
payed in two years. But for the Temporality, a Subsidy was demanded from them
of another kind: There were in the Kingdom several Colledges, Chappels,
Chantries, Hospitals, and Fraternities,<note place="margin">Chapters and
  Chanteries gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the King.</note> consisting of Secular Priests, who
enjoyed Pensions for saying Mass for the Souls of those who had endowed them.
Now the belief of Purgatory being left indifferent, by the Doctrine set out by
the Bishops, and the Trade of redeeming souls being condemned; it was thought
needless to keep up so many Endowments to no purpose. Those Priests were also
generally ill-affected to the Kings proceedings, since their Trade was so much
lessened by them. Therefore many of them had been dealt with to make
resignations: And four and twenty of them had surrendred to the King. It was
found also, that many of the Founders of these Houses had taken them into their
own hands, and that the Master, Wardens, and Governors of them had made
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for them, and given Leases of them: Therefore now a Subsidy being
demanded, all these were given to the King by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which also
confirmed the Deeds that any had made to the King: Empowering him in any time
of his life to issue out Commissions for seizing on these Foundations, and
taking them into his own possession: which being so seized on, should belong to
the King and his successors for ever. They also granted another Subsidy for the
War. When all their business was done, the King came to the House, and made a
long Speech, of which I cannot sufficiently wonder that no Entry is made in the
Journals of the House of Lords; Yet it is not to be doubted but he made it, for
it was published by <hi>Hall</hi> soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>When the Speaker of the House of Commons had presented the Bills,
with a Speech full of respect and complement, as is usual upon these occasions;
The King answered, 
<q>Thanking them for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidie,<note place="margin">The Kings
 speech to the Houses.</note> and the Bill about the Colledges and Chanteries;
  and assured them that he should take care, both for supplying the Ministers,
  for encouraging Learning, and relieving the Poor; and they should quickly
  perceive that in these things their expectations should be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, beyond
  what they either wished or desired. And after he had expressed his affection to
  them, and the assurance he had of their duty and fidelity to him, he advised
  them to amend one thing; which was, that in stead of Charity and Concord,
  Discord and Division ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led every where. He cited St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words,
  <hi>That Charity was gentle, and not envious, nor proud.</hi> But when one
  called another Heretick, and the other called him Papist, and Pharisee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
  were these the signs of Charity? The fault of this he charged chiefly on the
  Fathers and Teachers of the Spiritualty, who preached one against another,
  without <pb n="339" facs="tcp:104314:194"/> Charity or Discretion; some being too stiff in
  their old <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mpsimus,</hi>
  others too busie and curious in their new <hi>Sumpsimus</hi>; and few Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
  the Word of God truly and sincerely. And how could the poor people live in
  concord, when they sowed debate among them? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorted them to set
  forth Gods word, by true Preaching, and giving a good Example; or else he, as
  Gods Vicar, and high Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, would see these Enormities corrected, which if
  he did not do, he was an unprofitable Servant and an untrue Officer. He next
  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them of the Temporality, who railed at their Bishops and Priests:
  whereas if they had any thing to lay to their charge, they ought to declare it
  to the King or his Council, and not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to judge such high points.
  For tho they had the Scriptures given them in their Mother-Tongue, yet that was
  only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their own consciences, and instruct their Children and
  Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; but not to dispute, nor from thence to rail against Priests, and
  Preachers, as some vain persons did. He was sorry that such a Jewel, as the
  Word of God, was so ill used; that Rithmes and Songs were taken out of it: but
  much more sorry that men followed it so little; for Charity was neverfainter, a
  godly life never less appeared, and God was never less reverenced and
  worshipped. Therefore he exhorted them to live as Brethren in Charity together,
  to love, dread, and serve God; and then the love and union between Him and them
  should never be dissolved. And so exhorting them to look to the Execution of
  the Laws which themselves had desired, he gave his Royal Assent to the Bills,
  and dismissed the Parliament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King gave at this time a Commission to the Bishops of
<hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Chichester,</hi> and the Chancellor
of the Court of Augmentation, Sir <hi>Edward North,</hi> conteining, 
<q>That whereas the King had founded many Cathedrals, in which he
  had given large allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, both to be distributed to the poor, and to be laid
  out for the mending of high ways; To <hi>Canterbury</hi> 100 pounds for the
  poor, and 40 pounds for the high ways: To <hi>Rochester</hi> 20 pounds for the
  poor, and 20 pounds for the High-ways: To <hi>Westminster,</hi> 100 pounds for
  the poor, and 40 pounds for the High-ways: To <hi>Winchester</hi> 100 Marks for
  the poor, and 50 for the High-ways: To <hi>Bristol, Glocester, Chester,
  Burton</hi> upon <hi>Trent, Thornton, Peterborough,</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> 20
  pounds a piece for the poor, and as much for the High-ways: To
  <hi>Worcester</hi> 40 pounds for the poor, and 40 pounds for the High-ways: To
  <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resm</hi> 100 Marks for the poor, and 40 pounds for the High-ways: And
  to <hi>Carlile</hi> 15 pounds for the poor, and as much for the High-ways: In
  all about 550 pounds a year to the poor, and about 400 pounds a year for the
  High-ways: They were to enquire how this money was distributed; and, if they
  saw cause, they might order it to be applied to any other use which they should
  judge more charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and convenient.</q> But what followed upon this, does
not appear by the Records.</p>
            <p>After the Parliament was dissolved,<note place="margin">The King

ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the King, that they might not be included within the general

  Beggery would drive the Clergy to Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Superstition, and the old
  Idolatry: There were ravenous Wolves about the King, that would devour
  Universities, Cathedrals, and Chantries, and a thousand times as much.
  Posterity would wonder at such things: Therefore he desired the Universities
  might be secured from their Spoyls.</q> But the King did quickly free them from
these fears.</p>
            <p>Now I enter into the last year of this Kings Reign. The War in
<hi>France</hi> was managed with doubtful success: yet the losses were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on the <hi>English</hi> side. And the Forces being commanded by the Earl of
<hi>Surr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> who was brave, but
unsuccessful, he was not only blamed but recalled, and the Earl of
<hi>Hertford</hi> sent to Command in his room. But he being a man of an high
Spirit, and disdaining the Earl of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> who was now preferred
before him, let fall some words of high resentment, and bitter contempt, which
not long after wrought his ruine. The King was now alone in the War, which was
very charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him; and observing the Progress that the Council of
<hi>Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi> was making, where
Cardinal <hi>Pole</hi> being one of the Legates, he had reason to look for some
severe Decree to be made against himself; since none of the Hereticks of
<hi>Germany</hi> were so much hated by the Court of <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> as he was: Therefore he listned to the Counsels
of peace. And tho he was not old, yet he felt such decays in his strength, that
being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely corpulent, he had no reason to think he could live very long:
Therefore that he might not leave his young Son involved in a War of such
consequence,<note place="margin">Peace with <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> Peace was
concluded in <hi>Iune</hi>; which was much to the Kings honour, though the
taking and keeping of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> (which by this Peace the King was to
keep for eight years,) cost him above 1300000 pounds.</p>
            <p>Upon the peace, the <hi>French</hi> Admiral <hi>Annebault</hi>
came over to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A new design for
  Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And now again a Resolution of going on with a Reformation
was set on foot: for it was agreed between the King and the Admiral, That in
both Kingdoms, the Mass should be changed into a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and
<hi>Cranmer</hi> was Ordered to draw a Form of it. They also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to press
the Emperor to do the like in his Dominions, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to make War upon him.
But how this Project failed, does not appear. The Animosities which the former
War had raised between the two Kings, were converted into a firm Friendship:
which grew so strong on <hi>Francis</hi>'s part, that he never was seen glad at
any thing, after he had the news of the Kings death.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Shaxtons</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy.</note>But now one
of the Kings angry fits took him at the Reformers, so that there was a new
Prosecution of them. <hi>Nicholas Shaxton,</hi> that was Bishop of
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> had been long a Prisoner: but this year, he had said in his
Imprisonment, in the Counter in <hi>Bread-street, That Christs natural Body was
not in the Sacrament, but that it was a Sign and Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of his Body that was
crucified for us.</hi> Upon this he was endicted, and condemned to be burnt.
But the King sent the Bishops of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> to
deal with him to recant; which on the 9th of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> he did,
acknowledging, 
<q>That that year he had fallen in his old age in the Heresie of
  the Sacramentaries. But that he was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of that error, by their
  endeavours whom the King had sent to him. And therefore he thanked the King for

  subscribed a Paper of Articles, which will be found in the Collection.</q> Upon
this, he had his pardon and discharge sent him the 13 of <hi>Iuly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.</note> and soon after preached the
Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at the burning of <hi>Anne Askew</hi>; and wrote a Book in defence of
the Articles he had subscribed. What became of him all <hi>Edward</hi> the 6ths
time, I cannot tell: But I find, he was a cruel prosecutor and Burner of
Protestants, in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days. Yet it seems those to whom he went
over, did not consider him much, for they never rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him higher than to be
Bishop Suffragan of <hi>Ely.</hi> Others were also Endicted upon the same
Statute, who got off by recantation, and were pardoned. But <hi>Anne
Askews</hi> Trial had a more bloody Conclusion.</p>
            <p>She was nobly descended, and educated beyond what was ordinary in
that age to those of her Sex. But she was unfortunately married, to one
<hi>Kyme,</hi> who being a violent Papist, drave her out of his House, when he
found she favoured the Reformation. So she came to <hi>London,</hi>

               </note> where infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
being given of some words, that she had spoken against the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral presence
in the Sacrament, she was put in Prison: upon which, great applications were
made by many of her friends, to have her let out upon Bail. The Bishop of
<hi>London</hi> examined her, and after much pains, she was brought to set her
hand to a Recantation, by which she ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, 
<q>That the natural Body of Christ was present in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
  after the Consecration; whether the Priest were a good or an ill man: and that,
  whether it was presently consumed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the <hi>Pix,</hi> it was the
  true Body of Christ.</q> Yet she added to Her subscription, that she believed
all things according to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, and not otherwise. With this the
Bishop was not satisfied; but after much adoe, and many importunate addresses,
she was Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the end of <hi>March</hi> this year. But not long after
that, she was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain apprehended, and examined before the Kings Council then at
<hi>Greenwich,</hi> where she seemed very indifferent what they did with her.
She answered them in general words, upon which they could fix no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and
made some sharp reparties upon the Bishop of <hi>Winchester.</hi> Some liked
the wit and freedom of her discourse, but others thought she was too forward.
From thence she was sent to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where she wrote some devotions,
and Letters, that shew her to have been a woman of most extraordinary parts.
She wrote to the King, 
<q>That as to the Lords Supper, she believed as much as Christ had
  said in it, and as much, as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church from him did Teach.</q> Upon
<hi>Shaxtons</hi> Recantation they sent him to her to prevail with her. But she
in stead of yielding to him, charged his Inconstancy home upon him. She had
been oft at Court, and was much favoured by many great Ladies there; and it was
believed the Queen had shewed kindness to her. So the Lord Chancellor examined
her of what Favour or Encouragement she had from any in the Court, particularly
from the Dutchess of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Countess of <hi>Hertford,</hi> and
some other Ladies. But he could draw nothing from her, save that one in Livery
had brought her some money, which he said came from two Ladies in the Court.
But they resolved to extort further Confessions from her. And therefore
carrying her to the <hi>Tower,</hi> they caused her to be laid on the Rack, and
gave her a taste of it. Yet she confessed nothing. That she was rackt is very
certain, for I find it in an Original Journal of the Transactions in the Tower,
written by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony <pb n="342" facs="tcp:104314:197"/> Anthony;</hi> but <hi>Fox</hi>
adds a passage that seems scarce credible, the thing is so extraordinary, and
so unlike the Character of the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, who though he was fiercely
zealous for the old Superstition, yet was otherwise a great person: it is, that
he commanded the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> to stretch her more; but he
refused to do it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further prest told him plainly he would not do
it.<note place="margin">She endures the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ck.</note> The other threatned him, but to no purpose; so the Lord
Chancellor throwing off his Gown, drew the Rack so severely, that he almost
tore her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy asunder: yet could draw nothing from her, for she endured it
with unusual Patience and Courage. When the King heard this, he bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the
Lord Chancellor for his Cruelty, and excused the Lieutenant of the Tower.
<hi>Fox</hi> does not vouch any Warrant for this, so that though I have set it
down, yet I give no entire credit to it: if it was true, it shews the strange
influence of that Religion, and that it corrupts the Noblest natures; yet the
poor Gentlewomans being Rackt, wrought no pity in the King towards her, for he
left her to be proceeded against according to the Sentence: she was carried to
the Stake in <hi>Smith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

brought with her at the same time, one <hi>Nicolas Belenian</hi> a Priest,
<hi>Iohn Adams</hi> a Taylor, and <hi>Iohn Lassels</hi> one of the Kings
Servants, (it is likely he was the same person that had discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Queen
<hi>Katharine Howard</hi>'s incontinency, for which, all the Popish Party, to
be sure, bore him no good will.) They were all convicted upon the Statute of
the Six Articles, for denying the Corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ in the
Sacrament. When they were brought thither, <hi>Shaxton,</hi> to compleat his
Apostasie, made a Sermon of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inveighed against their Errors.
That being ended, they were tyed to the Stake; and then the Lord Chancellor
sent and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them their pardon, which was ready passed under the Seal, if
they would recant. But they loved not their lives so well, as to redeem them by
the loss of a good Conscience; and therefore encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging one another to suffer
patiently for the Testimony of the truth: so they endured to the last, and were
made Sacrifices by fire unto God. There were also two in <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

both of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and of the Queen: Conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that if these attempts were successful, they should carry every thing else.
They therefore renewed their Complaints of the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi>; and told the King, That though there were evident proofs
ready to be brought against him, yet because of his Greatness, and the Kings
Carriage upon the former Complaints, none durst appear against him. But if he
were once put in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that men might hope to be heard, they
undertook to bring full and clear Evidences of his being a Heretick. So the
King consented, That he should be the next day called before the Council, and
sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> if they saw cause for it. And now they concluded
him ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But in the night, the King sent Sir <hi>Anthony Denny</hi> to
<hi>Lambeth,</hi> to bring the Arch-Bishop to speak with him. And when he came,
the King told him what Informations had been brought against him, 
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:104314:197"/> and how far he had yielded to them, that he should be

<hi>Cranmer</hi> thanked him, that he had not left him in the dark, to be
surprised in a matter that concerned him so neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He acknowledged the Equity
of the Kings proceedings; and all that he desired, was, That he might be
brought to make his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: And that since he was to be Questioned for some of

                  </gap>e witnesses would not be suborned to
  ruin him. Therefore since he did not take care of himself, he would look to
  it.</q> And so he ordered him to appear next day before the Council, upon their
Summons; and when things were objected to him, to say, that since he was a
privy Councellor, he desired they would use him, as they would look to be used
in the like case: And therefore to move that his Accusers might be brought face
to face, and things be a little better considered before he was sent to the
<hi>Tower.</hi> And if they refused to grant that, then he was to appeal
personally to the King, (who intended to be absent that day,) and in token of
it, should shew them the Kings Seal-Ring which he wore on his finger, and was
well known to them all. So the King, giving him his Ring, sent him privately
home again. Next Morning a Messenger of the Council came early, and Summoned
him to appear that day before the Council. So he went over, but was long kept
waiting in the Lobby, before he was called in. At this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual sight many were
astonished. But Doctor <hi>Buts</hi> the Kings Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, that loved
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> and presumed more on a diseased King than others durst do,
went and told the King what a strange thing he had seen: 
<q>The Primate of all <hi>England</hi> waiting at the Council-door,
  among the foot-men and Servants.</q> So the King sent them word, that he should
be presently brought in; which being done, they said, That there were many
Informations against him, that all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies that were in <hi>England</hi>
came from him and his Chaplains. To which he answered as the King had directed
him. But they insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what was before projected, he said he was sorry to
be thus used, by those with whom he had sate so long at that Board, so that he
must appeal from them to the King: And with that took out the Kings Ring, and
shewed it. This put them in a wonderful confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they all rose up and
went to the King; 
<q>who checkt them severely for using the Arch-Bishop so
  unhandsomly. He said, he thought he had a wiser Council, than now he found they
  were. He protested by the Faith he owed to God, laying his hand on his Breast,
  That if a Prince could be obliged by his Subject, he was by the Arch-Bishop,
  and that he took him to be the most faithful Subject he had, and the person to
  whom he was most beholding.</q> The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> made a trifling
excuse, and said, They mean't no harm to the Arch-Bishop, but only to vindicate
his Innocency by such a Tryal, which would have freed him from the aspersions
that were cast on him. But the King answered, he would not suffer men 
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:104314:198"/> that were so dear to him, to be handled in that fashion.
He knew the Factions that were among them, and the malice that some of them
bore to others; which he would either extinguish or punish very speedily. So he
commanded them all to be Reconciled to <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>: Which was done with
the outward Ceremony of taking him by the hand; and was most real on his part,
though the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did not so easily lay down the hatred they bore
him.<note place="margin">Antiqu. <hi>Brit.</hi> in <hi>vita Cranmer</hi>

               <note place="margin">Another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign against the Queen.</note>That
Party finding it was in vain to push at <hi>Cranmer</hi> any more, did never
again endeavor it. Yet one Design failing, they set on another against the
Queen. She was a great Favourer of the Reformers, and had frequently Sermons in
her Privy-Chamber, by some of those Preachers; which were not secretly carryed;
but became generally known: When it came to the Kings ears, he took no notice
of it. And the Queen carryed her self, in all other things, not only with an
exact conduct, but with that wonderful care about the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which
became a Wife that was raised by him to so great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he was much taken
with her: So that none durst adventure on making any complaints against her.
Yet the Kings distempers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, and his peevishness growing with them, he
became more uneasie; and whereas she had frequently used to talk to him of
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and defend the Opinions of the Reformers, in which he would
sometimes pleasantly maintain the Argument; now, becoming more impatient, he
took it ill at her hands. And she had sometimes in the heat of discourse gone
very far. So one night, after she had left him, the King being displeased,
vented it to the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> that stood by: And he craftily
and maliciously struck in with the Kings anger, and said all that he could
devise against the Queen, to drive his resentments higher: and took in the Lord
Chancellor into the design, to assist him. They filled the Kings head with many
stories of the Queen, and some of her Ladies: and said, They had favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Anne Askew,</hi> and had Heretical Books amongst them; and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the King, that they were Traitors as well as Hereticks. The matter went so far,
that Articles were drawn against her, which the King Sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed; for without that, it was not safe for any to Impeach
the Queen. But the Lord Chancellor putting up that Paper carelesly it dropt
from him: And being taken up by one of the Queens Party, was carryed to her.
Whether the King had really designed her ruin, or not, is differently
represented by the Writers who lived near that time. But she seeing his hand to
such a Paper, had reason to conclude her self lost. Yet by advice of one of her
Friends, she went to see the King. who receiving her kindly, set on a Discourse
about Religion. But she answered, that women, by their first Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, were
made subject to men; and they being made after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, as the Women
were after their Image, ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their Wives; who were to learn of
them: and she much more, was to be taught by his Majesty, who was a Prince of
such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <pb n="345" facs="tcp:104314:198"/> Learning, and Wisdom. <hi>Not so by</hi>
St. <hi>Mary,</hi> said the King, <hi>you are become a Doctor, able to Instruct
us, and not to be Instructed by us.</hi> To which she answered, That it seemed
he had much mistaken the freedom she had taken to argue with him, since she did
it partly to engage him in discourse, and so put over the time, and make him
forget his pain; and partly to receive Instructions from him, by which she had
profited much. <hi>And is it even so?</hi> said the King, <hi>then we are
friends again.</hi> So he embraced her with great affection, and sent her away
with very tender assurances of his constant Love to her. But the next day had
been appointed for carrying her, and some of her Ladies, to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
The day being fair, the King went to take a little air in the Garden, and sent
for her to bear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. As they were together, the Lord Chancellor came
in, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about forty of the Guard with him, to have arrested the Queen. But
the King stept aside to him, and after a little discourse, he was heard to call
him <hi>Knave, Fool,</hi> and <hi>Beast,</hi> and he bade him get him out of
his Sight. The Innocent Queen who understood not that her danger was so near,
studied to mitigate the Kings displeasure, and interceded for the Lord
Chancellor. But the King told her, she had no reason to plead for him.</p>
            <p>So this design miscarried, which as it absolutely disheartned the
Papists, so it did totally alienate the King from them; and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar from
the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> whose sight he could never after this
endure. But he made an humble Submission to the King, which though it preserved
him from further punishment, yet could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him to the Kings favour.
But the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The causes of the Duke of
  <hi>Norfolks</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</note> and his Son the Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi>
fell under a deeper Misfortune. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> had been long Lord
Treasurer of <hi>England</hi>: He had done great services to the Crown on many
signal Occasions, and success had always accompanied him. His Son the Earl of
<hi>Surrey</hi> was also a brave and noble person, Witty and Learned to an high
degree, but did not command Armies with such Success. He was much provoked at
the Earl of <hi>Hertfords</hi> being sent over to <hi>France</hi> in his room,
and upon that had said, <hi>That within a little-while they should smart for
it</hi>; with some other expressions that savoured of Revenge, and a dislike of
the King, and a hatred of the Counsellors. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> had
endeavoured to ally himself to the Earl of <hi>Hertford,</hi> and to his
Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sir <hi>Thomas Seimour,</hi> perceiving how much they were in the
Kings favour, and how great an Interest they were like to have under the
succeeding Prince. And therefore would have engaged his Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a
Widower, to Marry that Earls Daughter: And pressed his Daughter, the Dutchess
of <hi>Richmond,</hi> Widow to the Kings Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son, to Marry Sir <hi>Thomas
Seimour.</hi> But though the Earl of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi> advised his Sister to the
Marriage projected for her, yet he would not consent to that designed for
himself, nor did the Proposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Sister take effect. The
<hi>Seimours,</hi> could not but see the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi>
bore them, and they might well be jealous of the Greatness of that Family;
which was not only too big for a Subject of it self, but was raised so high by
the dependence of the whole Popish Party, both at home and abroad, that they
were like to be very dangerous Competitors for the chief Government of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:104314:199"/> if the King were once out of the way; whose disease was
now growing so fast upon him, that he could not live many weeks. Nor is it
unlikely that they perswaded the King, that if the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi>
should marry the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> it might embroil his Sons Government, and
perhaps ruine him. And it was suggested, That he had some such high project in
his thoughts, both by his continuing unmarried, and by his using the Armes of
<hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, which of late he had given in his Coat, without
a Diminution. But to compleat the Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> ruin, his Dutchess
who had complained of his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her ill, and had been separated from him about
four years, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Informer against him. His Son and Daughter were also in ill
terms together. So the Sister Informed all that she could against her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And one Mrs <hi>Holland,</hi> for whom the Duke was believed to have an
unlawful affection, discovered all she knew; but all amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no more, than
some passionate Expressions of the Son, and some Complaints of the Father, who
thought he was not beloved by the King, and his Councellors, and that he was
ill used, in not being trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the secret of affairs. And all persons
being encouraged to bring Informations against them, Sr. <hi>Richard

               </hi> in some points that were of a higher nature: which the Earl
denied, and desired to be admitted, according to the Martial Law, to fight in
his shirt with <hi>Southwel.</hi> But that not being granted, he and his Father
were committed to the <hi>Tower.</hi> That which was most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on, was,
their giving the Arms of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor which were only to be
given by the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> This the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi>
justified, and said, they gave their Arms, according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the
Kings Heraulds. But all excuses availed nothing, for his Father and he were
designed to be destroyed, upon reasons of State; for which, some colours were
to be found out.</p>

resolved to compleat the misfortunes of that Family,<note place="margin">The

all his Eminent Services were now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, so the Submissions he made, could
not allay a displeasure, that was only to be satisfied with his Life and
Fortune. He wrote to the King, Protesting his Innocency: 
<q>That he had never a thought to his prejudice, and could not
  imagine what could be laid to his Charge: He had spent his whole Life in his
  Service, and did not know that ever he had offended any person; or that any
  were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with him, except for prosecuting the breakers of the Act about
  the Sacrament of the Altar. But in that, and in every thing else, as he had
  been always obedient to the Kings Laws, so he was resolved still to obey any
  Laws he should make. He desired he might <pb n="347" facs="tcp:104314:199"/> be examined
  with his Accusers face to face, before the King,<note place="margin">1547.</note>
  or at least before his Council; and if it did not appear that he was wrongfully
  accused, let him be punished as he deserved. In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion he begged the King
  would have pity on him, and restore him to his favour; taking all his Lands, or
  Goods from him, or as much of them, as he pleased.</q> Yet all this had no
effect on the King. So he was desired to make a more formal Submission; which
he did on the 12th of <hi>Ianuary</hi> under his hand, ten Privy Councellors
being Witnesses. In it he confessed, 
<q>First his discovering the Secrets of the Kings Council.
  <hi>Secondly,</hi> his concealing his Sons Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in using to give the Arms
  of St. <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, which did only belong to the King, and to
  which his Son had no Right. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he had ever since his
  Fathers death, born in the first quarter of his Arms, the Arms of
  <hi>England</hi>: with a difference of the Labells of Silver, that are the
  proper Arms of the Prince; which was done in prejudice of the King and the
  Prince: and gave occasion for disturbing or interrupting the Succession to the
  Crown of the Realm. This he acknowledged was high Treason, he confessed he
  deserved to be attainted of high Treason; and humbly begged the Kings Mercy and
  Compassion.</q> He yielded to all this, hoping by such a Submission and
Compliance to have overcome the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure. but his Expectations failed
him.</p>
            <p>A Parliament was called, the reason whereof was pretended to be
the Coronation of the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The
  Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meets.</note> But it was thought the true cause of calling it, was,
to Attaint the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>: for which they had not colour enough,
to do it in a Tryal by his Peers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Attaindor by Act of Parliament
was thought the better way. So it was moved, that the King intending to Crown
his Son, Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> desired they would go on with all possible
haste in the Attaindor of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>; that so these Places
which he held by Patent, might be disposed of by the King to such as he thought
fit, who should Assist at the Coronation. And upon this slight pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, since
a better could not be found; The Bill of Attaindor was read the first time on
the 18th of <hi>Ianuary</hi>: And on the 19th and 20th it was read the second
and third time.<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
  At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted.</note> And so passed in the House of Lords: and was sent down to
the Commons. Who on the 24th sent it up also passed. On the 27th the Lords were
ordered to be in their Robes, That the Royal assent might be given to it: which
the Lord Chancellor, with some others joyned in Commission, did give by vertue
of the Kings Letters Patents. And it had been executed the next Morning, if the
Kings death had not prevented it. Upon what grounds this Attaindor was founded,
I can only give this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from the 34th Act of the first Parliament of
Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; in which this Act is declared null and void, by the Common
Law of the Land; for I cannot find the Act it self upon Record. In the Act of
Repeal it is said, 
<q>That there was no special matter in the Act of Attaindor, but
  only general words of Treasons and Conspiracies: and that out of their care of
  the preservation of the King and the Prince, they passed it. But the Act of
  Repeal says also, That the only thing with which he was charged, was, For
  bearing of Arms, which he and his Ancestors had born, both within and without
  the <pb n="348" facs="tcp:104314:200"/> Kingdom: both in the Kings presence, and in the
  sight of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors: which they might Lawfully bear and give, as by good
  and substantial matter of Record it did appear. It is also added, That the King
  dyed after the date of the Commission, That the King only empowered them to
  give his Assent, but did not give it himself: And that it did not appear by any
  Record, that they gave it. That the King did not Sign the Commission with his
  own hand, his Stamp being only set to it: and that not to the upper, but the
  nether part of it, contrary to the Kings custom.</q> All these particulars,
though cleared afterwards, I mention now, because they give light to this
matter.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Act was passed, a Warrant was sent to the
Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by
  the Kings.</note> to cut off his head the next Morning; but the King dying in
the night, the Lieutenant could do nothing on that Warrant. And it seems it was
not thought advisable, to begin the new Kings Reign with such an Odious
Execution. And thus the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> escaped very narrowly. Both
Parties descanted on this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently. The Conscientious Papists said, it was
Gods just Judgment on him, (who had in all things followed the Kings pleasure,
often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times against his own Conscience;) That he should smart under that Power,
which himself had helped so considerably to make it be raised so high. The
Protestants could not but observe an hand of God, in measuring out such a hard
measure to him, that was so heavy on all those poor people that were questioned
for Heresie. But <hi>Cranmers</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in this matter was suitable to the
other parts of his Life, for he withdrew to <hi>Croydon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fox.</hi>
               </note> and would not so much as be present in
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, when so unjust an Act was passed, and his absence at this time was
the more considerable, since the King was so dangerously ill, that it must be
concluded it could be no slight Cause that made him withdraw at such a time.
But the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> had been his constant Enemy, therefore he
would not so much as be near the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Councils, when so strange an Act was
passing. But at the same time the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> was officiously
hanging on in the Court: and though he was forbid to come to Council, yet
always when the Councellors went into the Kings Bed-Chamber, he went with them
to the door, to make the World believe he was still one of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and
staying at the door till the rest came out, he returned with them. But he was
absolutely lost in the Kings Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors designs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the
  Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testants.</note>There is but one other step of Forreign business in this
Reign; which was an Embassy sent over by the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> to let
the King know of the League between the Pope and the Emperor, for the
Extirpation of Heresie: And that the Emperor was making War on him, and the
other Princes, in pursuance of that League. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he desired the Kings
Assistance. But at the same time, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror did by his Agents every-where
disown, that the War was made upon a Religious Account: And said it was only to
maintain the Rights of the Empire; which those Princes had affronted. So the
King answered, that as soon as it did appear to him, that Religion was the
cause of the War, he would Assist them. But that which made this so involved,
was, That though at <hi>Rome</hi> the Pope declared it was a Holy War, and
ordered Prayers and Processions to be made, <pb n="349" facs="tcp:104314:200"/> for Success;
yet the Emperor in all his Declarations took no notice of Religion: He had also
divided the Protestant Party, so that some of them joyned with him, and others
were Neutrals. And when in <hi>Germany</hi> it self this matter was so little
understood, it was easie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse Strangers by giving them a wrong Account of
it.</p>
            <p>The King was now overgrown with corpulency and fatness,<note place="margin">The
  Kings sickness.</note> so that he became more and more unwieldy. He could not
go up or down stairs, but as he was raised up, or let down by an Engine. And an
old sore in his Leg became very uneasie to him; so that all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in his
Body sinking down into his Leg, he was much pained, and became exceeding
froward and intractable, to which his inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable severity to the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk</hi> and his Son may be in a great measure imputed. His Servants
durst scarce speak to him, to put him in mind of his approaching end. And an
Act of Parliament which was made for the security of the Kings Life, had some
words in it against the Foretelling of his death; which made every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to speak to him of it: lest he in his angry and imperious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors should have
Ordered them to be Endicted upon that Statute. But he felt nature declining
apace, and so made the Will that he had left behind him at his last going into
<hi>France,</hi> be written over again; with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his only difference, That
<hi>Gardiner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> whom he had appointed one of
the Executors of his Will, and of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors to his Son, till he came of
Age, was now left out: Of which when Sir <hi>Anthony Brown</hi> put the King in
mind apprehending it was only an Omission, he answered, That he knew
<hi>Gardiners</hi> temper well enough, and though he could Govern him, yet none
of them would be able to do it; and that he would give them much trouble. And
when <hi>Brown</hi> at another time repeated the motion to the King; he told
him, if he spake more of that, he would strike him out of his Will too. The
Will was said to be Signed the 30th of <hi>December.</hi> It is Printed at
large by <hi>Fuller</hi>; and the most Material parts of it by <hi>Heylin.</hi>
So I need say little of it, only the most signal Clause in it, was, That he
excluded the Line of <hi>Scotland</hi> out of the Succession, and preferred the
two Daughters of the <hi>French</hi> Queen by <hi>Charles Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to
them. And this leads me to discover several things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Will, which
have been hitherto unknown. I draw them from a Letter written to Sir
<hi>William Cecil,</hi> then Secretary of State to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
(afterwards Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi>) by <hi>William Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of
<hi>Leithingtoun</hi> Secretary of State to the Queen of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
This <hi>Maitland</hi> was accounted a man of the greatest parts of any in his
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at that time; though his Treachery in turning over to the Party that
was against the Queen, very much blemished his other Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but he
expiated his fault by a real Repentance; which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his returning to
his duty, and losing all afterwards in her quarrel. His Letter will be found in
the <hi>Collection.</hi> The Substance and design of it, is,<note place="margin">Collect. <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. His latter will a Forgery</note> to
clear the Right his Mistress had to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>: in case the
Queen should die without Heirs of her Body. Therein after he had answered other
Objections, he comes to this of the Will. To it he says. 
<q>That according to the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Kings Will was to
  be Signed with his own hand; but this Will was only Signed by the Stamp. Then
  the King never Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <pb n="350" facs="tcp:104314:201"/> the Stamp to be put to it:<note place="margin">1542.</note> He had been oft desired to Sign it, but had always
  put it off; but when they saw his death approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one <hi>William
  Clark</hi> servant to <hi>Thomas Hennage</hi> put the Stamp to it, and some
  Gentlemen that were waiting without, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in to Sign it as Witnesses.
  For this he appeal'd to the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and desired
  the Marquess of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Earl of
  <hi>Pembroke,</hi> Sir <hi>William Petre,</hi> Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>vil,</hi> Sir <hi>Maurice Berkley,</hi>
  Sir <hi>Anthony Denny,</hi> Doctor <hi>Buts,</hi> and some others, might be
  examined; and that their Depositions might be entred in the Chancery. He also
  appealed to the Original Will, by which it would appear, That it was not
  Signed, but only Stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that not being according to the Act of
  Parliament, which in such extraordinary things must be strictly taken, the Will
  was of no force. Thus it appears, what vulgar Errors pass upon the World.</q>
And though for seventy five years, the <hi>Scotish</hi> Race has enjoyed the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and after so long a possession it is very
superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to clear a Title which is universally acknowledged; yet the
Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will not be ill pleased to see how ill-grounded that pretence was,
which some managed very seditiously during the Reign of Queen
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi> for excluding that Line.</p>
            <p>But if this Will was not signed by the King, other Grant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was certainly made by him on his
death-bed: one was to the City of <hi>London,</hi> of 500 Marks a year for
endowing an Hospital which was called <hi>Christs Hospital</hi>; and he order'd
the Church of the <hi>Franciscans</hi> a little within <hi>Newgate</hi> to be
opened, which he gave to the Hospital. This was done the 3d of
<hi>Ianuary.</hi> Another was of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledg in <hi>Cambridg</hi>
one of the Noblest Foundations in Christendom. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in a decay till
the 27 of the moneth; and then many signs of his approaching end appearing, few
would adventure on so unwelcom a thing as to put him in mind of his change then
imminent: but Sir <hi>Anthony Denny</hi> had the honesty and courage to do it,
and desired him to prepare for death, and remember his former life, and to call
on God for mercy through Jesus Christ. Upon which the King expressed his grief
for the Sins of his past Life, yet he said he trusted in the mercies of Christ,
which were greater than they were. Then <hi>Denny</hi> asked him if any
Churchman should be sent for; and he said, if any, it should be Arch-Bishop
<hi>Cranmer:</hi> and after he had rested a little, finding his Spirits decay
apace, he ordered him to be sent for to <hi>Croydon,</hi> where he was then.
But before he could come, the King was Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. So <hi>Cranmer</hi> desired
him to give some sign of his dying in the Faith of Christ, upon which he
squeezed his hand, and soon after died; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had Reigned 37 years, and 9
months, in the six and fiftieth year of his age. His death was kept up three
dayes, for the Journals of the House of Lords shew, that they continued reading
Bills, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in business till the 31st. and no sooner did the Lord
Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor signify to them that the King was dead, and that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was thereby dissolved. It is certain the Parliament had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the
Kings breath was out; so their sitting till the 31st shews, that the Kings
death was not generally known all those three dayes. The reasons of concealing
it so long might either be, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering what to do with the
Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> or that the <hi>Seymours</hi> 
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:104314:201"/>
were laying their matters,<note place="margin">1547.</note> so as to be secure in
the Government before they published the Kings Death. I shall not adventure on
adding any further Character of him, to that which is done with so much Wit and
Judgment by the Lord <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

an account of the blackest part of it, the Attaindors that passed the last 13
years of his life: which are comprehended within this Book, of which I have
cast over the Relation to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of it.</p>
            <p>In the latter part of his Reign,<note place="margin">An account of
  the Kings severities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Party.</note> there were many things
that seem great severities, especially as they are represented by the Writers
of the <hi>Roman</hi> party; whose relations are not a little strengthned by
the faint excuses and the mistaken accounts, that most of the Protestant
Historians have made. The King was naturally impetuous, and could not bear
provocation; the times were very ticklish; his Subjects were generally addicted
to the old Superstition, especially in the Northern parts; the Monks and Friers
were both numerous and wealthy; the Pope was his implacable Enemy, the Emperor
was a formidable Prince, and being then Master of all the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
had many advantages for the War he designed against <hi>En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>land.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Pole</hi> his kinsman, was going
over all the Courts of Christendom, to perswade a League against
<hi>England</hi>; as being a thing of greater necessity and merit than a War
against the <hi>Turk.</hi> This being, without the least aggravation, the state
of affairs at that time, it must be confessed he was sore put to it. A
Superstition that was so blind and headstrong, and Enemies that were both so
powerful, so spiteful, and so industrious, made ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour necessary: nor is any
General of an Army more concerned to deal severely with Spies and
Intelligencers, than he was to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the Popes adherents, or
such as kept correspondence with <hi>Pole.</hi> He had observed in History,
that upon much less provocation than himself had given, not only several
Emperors and forreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had been dispossessed of their Dominions; but
two of his own An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d and King <hi>Iohn</hi> had been
driven to great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, and forced to unusual and most indecent
submissions by the means of the Popes and their Clergy.</p>
            <p>The Popes power over the Clergy was so absolute, and their
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and obedience to him was so implicite; and the Popish Clergy had so
great an interest in the superstitious multitude, whose conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they
governed, that nothing but a stronger passion could either tame the Clergy, or
quiet the People. If there had been the least hope of impunity; the last part
of his Reign would have been one continued Rebellion; therefore to prevent a
more profuse effusion of blood, it seemed necessary to execute Laws severely in
some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar instances.</p>
            <p>There is one calumny that runs in a thread through all the
Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of the Popish side, which not a few of our own have ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken up, That many were put to death for not swearing the Kings Supremacy. It
is an impudent falshood; for not so much as one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son suffered on that
account; nor was there any Law for any such Oath before the Parliament in the
28th year of the Kings Reign, when the unsufferable Bull of Pope <hi>Paul</hi>
the 3d, engaged him to look a little more to his own safety. Then indeed in the
Oath for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="352" facs="tcp:104314:202"/> the successiono f the Crown, the
Subjects were required under the pains of Treason, to swear that the King was
supream head of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; but that was not mentioned in
the former Oath that was made in the 25th, and enacted in the 26 year of his
Reign. It cannot but be confessed, that to enact under pain of death that none
should deny the Kings Titles, and to proceed upon that against offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, is a
very different thing, from forcing them to swear the King to be the Supream
Head of the Church.</p>

judgment was given that they should suffer as Traitors. The Record mentions no
other particulars; but the writers of the Popish side make a splendid recital
of the courage and constancy they expressed both in their Tryal, and at their
Death. It was no difficult thing for men so used to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend, and the making
of fine stories for the Saints and Martyrs of their Orders, to dress up such
Narratives with much pomp. But as their pleading <hi>Not Guilty</hi> to the

themselves confessed the Enditement, before the Jury went aside, and put

dyed, the tenth was hanged in the beginning of <hi>August.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those persons I find this said in some Original Letters, that they had brought
over into <hi>England,</hi> and vented in it, some Books that were written
beyond Sea, against the Kings Marriage, and his other proceedings, which being
found in their house, they were pressed to peruse the Books that were written
for the King, but obstinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to do it; they had also been involved in
the business of the Maid of <hi>Kent,</hi> for which, though all the Complices
in it, except those whom suffered for it, were pardoned by Act of Parliament,
yet such as had been concerned in it, were still under jealousie: and it is no
wonder that upon new provocations they met with the uttermost ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the
Law.</p>
            <p>These Tryals made way for two others that were more Signal:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fishers</hi> Tryal and death.</note> of the Bishop of
<hi>Rochester,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas More.</hi> The first of these had been a
Prisoner above a year, and was very severely used: he complained in his Letters
to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that he had neither Cloaths, nor fire, being then about
fourscore. This was understood at <hi>Rome,</hi> and upon it, Pope
<hi>Clement,</hi> by an Officious kindness to him, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in spite to King
<hi>Henry,</hi> declared him a Cardinal, and sent him a Red-hat. When the King
knew this, he sent to Examine him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; but he protested he had used no
endeavours to procure it, and valued it so little, that if the Hat were lying
at his feet, he would not take it up. It never came nearer him than
<hi>Picardy</hi>: yet this did precipitate his ruin. But if he had kept his
opinion of the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy to himself, they could not have proceeded
further. He would not do that, but did upon several occasions speak against it,
so he was brought to his Tryal on the 17th of <hi>Iune.</hi> The Lord
Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and some other Lords, together with
the Judges, sate upon him by a Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and
<hi>Terminer.</hi> He pleaded <hi>not-Guilty,</hi> but being found Guilty,
Judgment was passed on him to die as a Traitor; but he was by a Warrant from
the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed. Upon the 22d of <hi>Iune,</hi> being the day of his
Execution, he dressed himself with more than ordinary care; and when his man
took notice of it, he told him, he was to be that day a Bridegroom. As he was
led to the place of Execution, being stopt in the way by the croud, he opened
his new Testament, and prayed to this purpose; that, as that Book had been his
companion and chief comfort in his imprisonment, so then some place might turn
up to him, that might <pb n="354" facs="tcp:104314:203"/> comfort him in his last passage:
This being said, he opened the Book at a venture, in which these words of St.
<hi>Iohns</hi> Gospel turned up: <hi>This is Life eternal to know th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

whom thou hast sent.</hi> So he shut the Book with much saisfaction, and all
the way was repeating and meditating on them. When he came to the Scaffold he
pronounced the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and after some other devotions his head was
cut off.</p>

               <note place="margin">His Character.</note>Thus dyed <hi>Iohn
Fisher</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> in the 80th year of his Age. He was a
Learned and devout man, but much addicted to the superstitions in which he had
been bred up: And that led him to great severities against all that opposed
them. He had been for many years Confessor to the Kings Grand-Mother, the
Countess of <hi>Richmon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>; and
it was believed that he perswaded her to these Noble designs for the
advancement of Learning, of Founding two Colledges in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> St.
<hi>Iohns,</hi> and <hi>Christs Colledge,</hi> and Divinity Professors in both
Universities. And in acknowledgment of this, he was chosen Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the
University of <hi>Cambridge. Henry</hi> the 7th gave him the Bishoprick of
<hi>Rochester,</hi> which he, following the rule of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church,
would never change for a better; he used to say his Church was his Wife, and he
would never part with her, because she was poor. He continued in great favour
with the King, till the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of the Divorce was set on foot; and then he
adhered so firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Queens cause, and the Popes Supremacy, that he was
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed by that, headlong into great Errors; as appears by the business of the
Maid of <hi>Kent</hi>: Many thought the King ought to have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against
him rather upon that, which was a point of State, than upon the Supremacy,
which was matter of Conscience. But the King was resolved to let all his
Subjects see, there was no Mercy to be expected by any that denyed his being
Supream head of the Church; and therefore made him and <hi>More,</hi> two
Examples for ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the rest. This being much censured beyond Sea,
<hi>Gardiner,</hi> that was never wanting in the most servile complyances,
wrote a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Kings proceedings. The Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> had it
in his hands, and tells us it was written in elegant Latine, but that he
thought it too long, and others judged it was too vehement, to be inserted in
his History.</p>

pressing him concerning the Kings Supremacy, he said he would not meddle with

<q>
                  <hi>Rich</hi> pressed him,<note place="margin">1535.</note> that
  since the Parliament had Enacted that the King was Supream Head, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
  ought to agree to it, and said <hi>Rich,</hi> what if the Parliament should
  declare me King, would you not acknowledge me? I would, said <hi>More,
  Quia</hi> (as it is in the Indictment) <hi>Rex per Parliamentum fieri potest,
  &amp; per Parliamentum deprivari</hi>; but <hi>More</hi> turned the Argument on
  <hi>Rich,</hi> and said, what if the Parliament made an Act that God was not
  God; <hi>Rich</hi> acknowledged it could not bind: but replyed to
  <hi>More,</hi> that since he would acknowledg him King, if he were made so by
  Act of Parliament, why would he not acknowledg the King Supream Head, since it
  was enacted by Parliament. To that <hi>More</hi> answered, that the Parliament
  had power to make a King, and the people were bound to acknowledg him, whom
  they made; but for the Supremacy, though the Parliament had Enacted it, yet
  those in forreign parts had never assented to it.</q> This was carryed by
<hi>Rich</hi> to the King, and all these particulars were laid together, and
judged to amount to a denyal of the Supremacy. Judge <hi>Spelman</hi> writ,
that <hi>More</hi> being on his Tryal, pleaded strongly against the Statute
that made it Treason to deny the Supremacy, and argued that the King could not
be Supream Head of the Church: When he was brought to the Bar, he pleaded not
Guilty, but being found Guilty, judgment was given against him as a Traitor. He
received it with that equal temper of mind, which he had shewed in both
conditions of Life, and then set himself wholly to prepare for death; he
expressed great contempt of the World, and that he was weary of Life, and
longed for death; which was so little terrible to him, that his ordinary
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetiousness remained with him even on the Scaffold. It was censured by many
as light and undecent; but others said, that way having been so natural to him
on all other occasions, it was not at all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; but shewed that death did
no way discompose him, and could not so much as put him out of his ordinary
humour. Yet his rally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing on the Scaffold, was thought to have more
of the Stoick than the Christian in it. After some time spent in secret
devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he was beheaded on the 6th of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus did Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> end his days, in the 53d year of
his age.<note place="margin">His Character.</note> He was a man of rare vertues,
and excellent parts: In his youth he had freer thoughts of things, as appears
by his <hi>Vtopia,</hi> and his Letters to <hi>Erasmus</hi>; but afterwards he
became superstitiously devoted to the interests and passions of the Popish
Clergy: and as he served them when he was in Authority, even to assist them in
in all their cruelties; so he employed his pen in the same cause, both in
writing against all the new opinions in general, and in particular against
<hi>Tindal, Frith,</hi> and <hi>Barnes,</hi> as also an unknown Writer, who
seemed of neither party, but reprooved the corruptions of the Clergy, and
condemned their cruel proceedings. <hi>More</hi> was no Divine at all, and it
is plain to any that reads his writings, that he knew nothing of Antiquity;
beyond the quotations he found in the Canon-Law, and in the Master of the
senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: (only he had read some of St. <hi>Austins</hi> treatises,) for upon
all points of Controversie, he quotes only what he found in these Collections;
nor was he at all conversant in the critical learning upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but
his peculiar excellency in writing, was, that he had a <pb n="356" facs="tcp:104314:205"/>
natural easie expression, and presented all the opinions of Popery with their
fair side to the Reader, disguising or concealing the black side of them with
great Art; and was no less dextrous in exposing all the ill consequences that
could follow on the Doctrine of the Reformers: and had upon all occasions great
store of pleasant tales, which he applyed wittily to his purpose. And in this
consists the great strength of his Writings, which were designed rather for the
Rabble, than for Learned men. But for justice, contempt of money, humility, and
a true generosity of mind, he was an example to the Age in which he lived.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing unjustly added to the praise of these two
great men, or rather feigned, on design to lessen the Kings honour; that
<hi>Fisher</hi> and he penned the book which the King wrote against
<hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> This <hi>Sanders</hi> first published, and <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
and others since have taken it up upon his Authority. Strangers may be pardoned
such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but they are inexcusable in an <hi>English</hi> man. For in
<hi>Mores</hi> print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works there is a Letter written by him out of the
<hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> in which he gives an account of his
behaviour concerning the Kings Divorce and Supremacy: among other particulars
one is, 
<q> that when the King shewed him his Book against <hi>Luther,</hi>
  in which he had asserted the Popes Primacy to be of Divine right, <hi>More</hi>
  desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to leave it out; since as there had been many contests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
  Popes and other Princes, so there might fall in some between the Pope and the
  King; therefore he thought it was not fit for the King to publish any thing,
  which might be afterwards made use of against himself: and advised him either
  to leave out that point, or to touch it very tenderly; but the King would not
  follow his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, being perhaps so fond of what he had writ, that he would
  ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther run himself upon a great inconvenience, than leave out any thing that
  he fancied so well written.</q> This shews that <hi>More</hi> knew that Book
was written by the Kings own pen; and either <hi>Sanders</hi> never read this,
or maliciously concealed it, lest it should discover his foul dealing.</p>
            <p>These Executions so terrified all people, that there were no
further provocations given: and all persons either took the Oaths, or did so
dextrously conceal their opinions, that till the Rebellions of
<hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> and the North, broke out, none suffered after this upon
a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick account. But when these were quieted, then the King resolved to make
the chief Authors and Leaders of those Commotions publick examples to the rest.
The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> proceeded against many of them by Martial Law,

that they had met together on the 17th of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and consulted how

were then in the North; by which they had forfeited all the favour, to which
they could have pretended, by vertue of the Indemnity that was granted in the
end of <hi>December,</hi> and of the pardons which they had taken out. They
were all found Guilty, and had judgment as in cases of Treason; divers of them
were carryed down into <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> and <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and
execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the places where their Treasons were committed; but most of them

for the great conduct of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the King had by all
appearance lost his Crown. And it will not seem strange that a King,
(especially so tempered as this was,) had a mind to strike terror into the rest
of his Subjects, by some signal Examples, and to put out of the way the chief
lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that design: nor was it to be wondered at, that the Abbots and
other Clergy-men who had been so active in that Commotion, were severely
handled. It was by their means that the discontents were chiefly fomented; they
had taken all the Oaths that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them, and yet continued to be still
practising against the State; which, as it was highly contrary to the peaceable
Doctrines of the Christian Religion, so it was in a special manner contrary to
the Rules which they professed; that obliged them to forsake the World, and to
follow a Religious and Spiritual course of Life.<note place="margin">1538.</note>

<hi>Observant</hi> Frier; he had been, as <hi>Sanders</hi> says, Confessor to
Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> but it seems departed from her interests; for he
insinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself so into the King, that he recovered his good Opinion.
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ignorant and lewd man, he was accounted by the better sort of that
House, to which he belonged in <hi>Greenwich,</hi> a Reproach to their Order,
(concerning this, I have seen a large account in an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Letter written by
a Brother of the same House.) Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained the Kings good Opinion, he put
all those who had favoured the Divorce under great fears, for he proceeded
cruelly against them. And one <hi>Rainscroft,</hi> being suspected to have
given secret Intelligence of what was done among them, was shut up, and so
hardly used that he dyed in their hands, which was (as that Letter relates)
done by Frier <hi>Forrests</hi> means. This Frier was found to have denyed the
Kings Supremacy: for though he himself had sworn it, yet he had infused it into
many in Confession, that the King was not the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Head of the Church.
Being questioned for these practices, which were so contrary to the Oath that
he had taken, he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 
<q>that he took that Oath with his outward man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hall.</hi>
                  </note> but his inward man had never consented to

that he held, he submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <pb n="358" facs="tcp:104314:206"/> to the Church.<note place="margin">1538.</note> Upon this he had more freedom allowed him in the
Prison; but some coming to him diverted him from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission he had
offered; so that when the Paper of Abjuration was brought him, he refused to
set his hand to it: upon which he was judged an Obstinate Heretick. The Records
of these Proceedings are lost, but the Books of that time say, that he denyed
the Gospel; it is like it was upon that pretence, that without the
determination of the Church it had no Authority, upon which, several writers of
the Roman Communion have said undecent and scandalous things of the holy
Scriptures. He was brought to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> where were present the Lords
of the Council, to offer him his pardon if he would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure. <hi>Latimer</hi>
made a Sermon against his errors, and studyed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to recant; but
he continued in his former opinions, so he was put to death in a most severe
manner. He was hanged in a chain about his middle, and the great Image that was

of mind, and ended his Life in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly manner, as <hi>Hall</hi> says, who
adds this Character of him,

  see a change of this World; I trust to have a fair day upon those Knaves that
  rule about the King; and I trust to see a merry World one day.</q> Words to the
same purpose were also charged on the Marquess: the Lord <hi>Montacute</hi>
further said, 
<q>I would I were over the Sea with my Brother, for this World will
  one day come to stripes: it must needs so come to pass, and I fear we shall

and had subjected themselves to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome, Pole</hi> being made
Cardinal by him; and for writing Treasonable Letters, and sending them into
<hi>England.</hi> On the 4th of <hi>February</hi> following, Sir <hi>Nicholas

  of the Court is, the more just and honourable it ought to be in the
  proceedings, and to give Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Justice to inferior Courts.</q> The chief
of these were the Marchioness of <hi>Exeter</hi> and the Countess of
<hi>Sarum.</hi> The special mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter charged on the former, is, her
confederating her self to Sir <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Carew</hi> in his Treasons; to which
is added, 
<q>that she had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted divers other abominable Treasons. The
  latter is said to have confederated her self with her Son the Cardinal, with
  other aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating words.</q> It does not appear by the Journal that any
Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses were examined; only that day that the Bills were read the third time
in the House of Lords, <hi>Cromwell</hi> shewed them a Coat of white silk,
which the Lord Admiral had found among the Countess of <hi>Sarums</hi> Cloaths,
in which the Arms of <hi>England</hi> were wrought on the one side, and the
Standard that was carryed before the Rebels was on the other side. This was
brought as an evidence that she approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Rebellion. Three
<hi>Irish</hi> Priests were also Attainted for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Letters out of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Pope and Cardinal <hi>Pole,</hi> as also Sir
<hi>Adrian Fortescue</hi> for endeavouring to raise Rebellion, <hi>Thomas
Ding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> a Knight of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
<hi>Robert Granceter</hi> Merchant, for going to several Forreign Princes, and
perswading them to make War upon the King, and assist the Lords <hi>Darcy</hi>
and <hi>Hussie</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion they had raised. Two Gentlemen, a
Dominican Frier, and a Yeoman, were by the same Act Attainted, for saying that,
<hi>that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Serpent the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>was Supream Head of the
Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Another Gentleman, two Priests, and a Yeoman are
Attainted for Treason in general, no particular crime being specified. Thus
six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen persons were in this manner Attainted, and if there was any
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of Witnesses for convicting them, it was either in the
Star-Chamber, or before the Privy Council; for there is no mention of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
evidence that was brought in the Journals: There was also much haste made in
the passing this Bill: it being brought in the 10th of <hi>May,</hi> was read
that day for the first, and second time, and the 11th of <hi>May</hi> for the
third time. The Commons kept it five days before they sent it back, and added
some more to those that were in the Bill at first; but how many were named in
the Bill Originally, and how many were afterwards added, cannot be known.
<hi>Fortescue</hi> and <hi>Dingley</hi> suffered the 10th of <hi>Iuly.</hi> As
for the Countess of <hi>Sarum,</hi> the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> saw in a Record,
that Bulls from the Pope were found in her House, 
<q>that she kept correspondence with her Son, and that she forbade
  her Tenants to have the new Testament in <hi>English,</hi> or any other of the
  Books that had been published by the Kings Authority.</q> She was then about
seventy years of Age, but shewed by the answers she made, that she had a
vigorous and masculine mind. She was kept two years Prisoner in the
<hi>Tower,</hi> after the Act had passed, the King by that reprieve designing
to oblige her Son to a better behaviour; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a fresh provocation by a new
Rebellion in the North, she was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, <pb n="361" facs="tcp:104314:207"/> and in her,
the name and line of <hi>Plantagenet</hi> determined.<note place="margin">1540.</note> The Marchioness of <hi>Exceter</hi> died a natural
death. In <hi>November</hi> this year were the Abbots of <hi>Reading,
Glossenbury</hi> and <hi>Colechester</hi> Attainted of Treason, of which
mention was made formerly.</p>
            <p>In the Parliament that sate in the year 1540 they went on to
follow that strange precedent, which they had made the former year. By the 56th
Act <hi>Giles Heron</hi> was Attainted of Treason, no special matter being
mentioned.</p>
            <p>By the 57th Act, <hi>Richard Fetherstoun, Thomas Abell,</hi> and
<hi>Edward Pole</hi> Priests, and <hi>William Horn</hi> a Yeoman were
Attainted, for denying the Kings Supremacy, and adhering to the Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi>: by the same Act the Wife of one <hi>Tirrell</hi> Esquire was
Attainted, for refusing her duty of Alleageance, and denying Prince
<hi>Edward</hi> to be Prince and heir of the Crown; and one <hi>Laurence
Cook</hi> of <hi>Doncaster</hi> was also Attainted for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving the Kings
death.</p>
            <p>By the 58th Act, <hi>Gregory Buttolph, Adam Damplip,</hi> and
<hi>Edward Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deholm</hi> Clerks, and <hi>Clement Philpot</hi> Gentleman,
were Attainted, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for corresponding
with Cardinal <hi>Pole,</hi> and endeavouring to surprize the Town of
<hi>Callais</hi>: By the same Act <hi>Barnes, Gerard,</hi> and <hi>Ierome,</hi>
were Attainted, of whose sufferings an account has been already given.</p>
            <p>By the 59th Act, <hi>William Bird</hi> a Priest, and Chaplain to
the Lord <hi>Hungerford</hi> was attainted, for having said to one that was
going to Assist the King against the Rebels in the North, 
<q>I am sorry thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, seest thou not how the King plucketh
  down Images and Abbies every day? and if the King go thither himself, he will
  never come home again, nor any of them all which go with him, and in truth it
  were pity he should ever come home again; and at another time upon ones saying,
  O good Lord, I ween all the World will be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in a little time:
  <hi>Bird</hi> said, doest thou marvel at that? I tell thee it is no marvel, for
  the great Master of all is an Heretick, and such a one as there is not his like
  in the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By the same Act the Lord <hi>Hungerford</hi> was likewise
Attainted. 
<q>The Crimes specified are, that he knowing <hi>Bird</hi> to be a
  Traitor, did enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him in his house as his Chaplain; that he ordered
  another of his Chaplains, Sir <hi>Hugh Wood,</hi> and one Doctor
  <hi>Maudlin</hi> to use Conjuring, that they might know how long the King
  should live, and whether he should be victorious over his Enemies or not; and
  that these three years last past he had frequently committed the detestable sin
  of Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with several of his Servants:</q> All these were Attainted by that
Parliament. The Lord <hi>Hungerford</hi> was Executed the same day with
<hi>Cromwell</hi>; he dyed in such disorder that some thought he was frenetick,
for he called often to the Executioner to dispatch him, and said he was weary
of Life, and longed to be dead, which seemed strange in a man that had so
little cause to hope in his death. For <hi>Powel, Fetherstoun,</hi> and
<hi>Abell,</hi> they suffered the same day with <hi>Barnes</hi> and his
friends, as hath been already shewn.</p>
            <p>This year <hi>Sampson</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> and one
Doctor <hi>Wilson</hi> were put in the <hi>To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er,</hi> upon suspition of correspondence with the Pope. But upon
their submission they had their pardon and liberty. In the year 1541, five
Priests and ten secular persons, some of them being Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen 
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:104314:208"/> of Quality,<note place="margin">1535.</note> were raising
a new Rebellion in <hi>Yorkshire</hi>; which was suppressed in time, and the
Promoters of it being apprehended, were Attainted and Executed, and this
occasioned the death of the Countess of <hi>Sarum,</hi> after the Execution of
the Sentence had been delayed almost two years.</p>
            <p>The last instance of the Kings severity was in the year 1543, in
which one <hi>Gardiner</hi> that was the Bishop of <hi>Winchesters</hi> kinsman
and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, and three other Priests, were tryed, for denying the Kings
Supremacy, and soon after Executed. But what special matter was laid to their
charge, cannot be known, for the Record of their Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor is lost.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>These were the
proceedings of this King against those that adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the interests of
<hi>Rome</hi>: in which, though there is great ground for just censure, for as
the Laws were rigorous, so the Execution of them was raised to the highest that
the Law could admit; yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them to justifie all the clamors,
which that party have raised against King <hi>Henry,</hi> and by which they
pursue his memory to this day; and are far short, both in number and degrees,
of the cruelties of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign, which yet they endeavour all
that is possible to extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or deny.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, we have now gone through the Reign of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, who is rather to be reckoned among the <hi>Great</hi>
than the <hi>Good</hi> Princes. He exercised so much severity on men of both
perswasions, that the writers of both sides have laid open his faults, and
taxed his cruelty. But as neither of them were much obliged to him, so none
have taken so much care to set forth his good qualities, as his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have
done to enlarge on his Vices: I do not deny that he is to be numbered among the
<hi>ill</hi> Princes, yet I cannot rank him with the <hi>worst.</hi>

               <p>THere it is said, that the Earl of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> Father to
  Queen <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi> was one of the Peers that Judged her.</p>
               <p>In this I too Implicitly followed Doctor <hi>Heylin,</hi> he
  seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to write with more than ordinary care for the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that
  Queen, and with such assurance, as if he had seen the Records concerning her,
  so that I took this upon trust from him. The reason of it was, that in the
  search I made of Attaindors, I did not find the Record of her Tryal; so I
  concluded, that either it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by Order during her Daughters Reign,
  or was accidentally lost since that time: And thus having no Record to direct
  me, I too easily followed the Printed Books in that particular. But after that
  part of this History was wrought off, I by chance met with it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place
  where it was mislaid; and there I discovered the error I had committed. The
  Earl of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> was not one of her Judges; these by whom she was
  tryed were the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Exceter,</hi> the
  Earls of <hi>Arundell, Oxford, Northumberland, West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland, Derby, Worcester,
  Rutland, Sussex,</hi> and <hi>Huntington,</hi> and the Lords <hi>Audley,
  Delaware, Mountague, Morley, Dacres, Cobham, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travers, Powis, Mounteagle,
  Clinton, Sands, Windsor, Wentworth, Burgh,</hi> and <hi>Mordant</hi>: in all
  twenty six, and not twenty Eight as I reckoned them upon a Vulgar Error. The
  Record mentions one particular concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
  that he was taken with a sudden fit of sickness, and was forced to leave the
  Court before the Lord <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> was Tryed. This might have been only
  Casual: but since he was once in Love with the Queen, and had designed to Marry
  her (see Page. 44) it is no wonder if so sad a change in her Condition, did
  raise an unusual disorder in him.</p>
               <p>When I had discovered the mistake I had made, as I resolved to
  publish this free Confession of it; so I set my self not without some
  Indignation to examine upon what Authority Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> had led me
  into it. I could find no Author that went before him in it, but
  <hi>Sanders</hi>; the chief design of whose writing, was to defame Queen
  <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and to blast her Title to the Crown. To that end it was no
  ill piece of his skill, to perswade the World of her Mother lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to say,
  that her own Father was convinced of it, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="364" facs="tcp:104314:209"/>
  her for it. And Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> took this, as he has done many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
  things, too easily upon <hi>Sanders</hi> Testimony.</p>

  Sacraments, which had been left undetermined by the former Articles, might be

               <p>The second Paper consists of two Resolutions, made concerning
  Confirmation by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Stokesley</hi>
  Bishop of <hi>London</hi> (by which I perceive the way of examining matters by
  giving out of questions to Bishops and Divines was sooner practised, then when
  I first took notice of it page 286.) there are several other Papers concerning
  Confirmation, but these are only Subscribed: and the rest do generally follow
  these two Prelates who were then the heads of two different parties. The
  Arch-Bishop went on this ground, that all things were to be tryed by the
  Scripture; but <hi>Stokesley</hi> and almost the whole Clergy, were for
  receiving the Tradition of the Church, as not much inferiour to the Scriptures,
  which he asserts in his Subscription.</p>
               <p>The third Paper was offered to the King by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> to
  perswade him to proceed to a further Reformation:<note place="margin">Collect.
 Addenda <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.</note> that things might be long and well considered
  before they were determined, that nothing might be declared a part of Gods
  faith, without good proofs from Scripture: the departing from which rule had
  been the occasion of all the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that had been in the Church: that now men
  would not be led as they had been, but would examine matters: that many things
  were now acknowledged to be truths, such as the unlawfulness of the Popes
  Usurped Power, for which many had formerly suffered death. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he
  desires that some points might be Examined by Scrinture, as, whether there is a
  Purgatory, whether departed Souls ought to be Invocated, whether Tradition
  ought to be believed; whether there be any satisfaction besides the
  satisfaction of Christ, whether free will <pb n="365" facs="tcp:104314:209"/> may dispose it
  self to grace, and whether Images ought to be kissed, or used to any other end,
  but as representations of a piece of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? In all these he desired the King
  would suspend his Judgment: and in particular, that he would not determine
  against the Lawfulness of the Marriage of the Clergy, but would for some time
  silence both parties. He also proposed that this point might by order from the
  King, be examined in the Universities before indifferent Judges: that all the
  Arguments against it, might be given to the Defenders twelve days before the
  publick disputation; and he offered, that if those who should defend the
  Lawfulness of Priests Marriage, were in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of indifferent Judges
  overcome, they should willingly suffer death for it; but if otherwise, all they
  desired was, that in that point the King might leave them in the liberty to
  which the Word of God left them.</p>

               <p>I have seen a much fuller paper concerning Orders and
  Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal functions (which the Reader will find in the Collection) signed
  by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the two Arch-Bishops and eleven Bishops,<note place="margin">Collect. Addenda <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.</note> and twenty Divines and
  Canonists, Declaring that the Power of the Keys and other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functions is
  formally distinct from the Power of the Sword. That this Power is not absolute,
  but to be limited by the Rules that are in the Scripture; and is ordained only
  for the edification and good of the Church: that this Power ought to be still
  preserved, since it was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by Christ as the mean of reconciling sinners to
  God. Orders were also declared a Sacrament, since they consisted of an outward
  action instituted by Christ, and an inward grace conferred with them: But that
  all Inferiour Orders, <hi>Ianitors, Lectors,</hi> &amp;c. were brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
  the Church to beautifie and adorn it, and were taken from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the
  <hi>Iews</hi>: And that in the New Testament there is no mention made but of
  Deacons or Ministers, and Priests or Bishops: nor is there belonging to Orders
  any other Ceremony mentioned in the Scripture, but Prayer and Imposition of
  hands. This was signed either in the year 1537 or 1538, since it is Subscribed
  both by <hi>Iohn Hilsey</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and <hi>Edward
  Fox</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> for the one was consecrated in 1537, and
  the other dyed in <hi>May</hi> 1538.</p>
               <p>On this Paper I will add two remarks, the one is, that after
  this I do never find the Inferiour Degrees under a Deacon mentioned in this
  Church; so it seems at this time they were laid aside. They were first set up
  in the Church about the end of the second or the beginning of the third
  Century, in the middle of which we find both <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop of
  <hi>Rome,</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> mentioning them as Orders that were
  then established; and it seems they were designed as previous steps to the
  Sacred functions, that none might be Ordained to these, but such as had been
  long before separated from a secular state of Life, and had given good proofs
  of themselves in these lower degrees. But it turned in the Church of
  <hi>Rome</hi> to be only a matter of form; and many took the first Tonsure,
  that they might be exempted from the Secular Power, and be qualified for
  Commendams, and some other Worldly advantages to which these lower Orders were
  sufficient, by those Rules which the Canonists had brought in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:104314:210"/>Another thing is, that both in this
  Writing and in the Necessary Erudition of a Christian man, Bishops and Priests
  are spoken of as one and the same Office. In the Antient Church they knew none
  of those Subtilties which were found out in the latter Ages. It was then
  thought enough that a Bishop was to be dedicated to his function by a new
  Imposition of hands, and that several Offices could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without
  Bishops, such as Ordination Confirmation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they did not
  refine in these matters, so much as to enquire whether Bishops and Priests
  differed in Order and Office or only in degree. But after the Schoolmen fell to
  examine matters of Divinity with Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Unintelligible niceties, and the
  Canonists began to Comment upon the rules of the Ancient Church, they studied
  to make Bishops and Priests seem very near one another, so that the difference
  was but small. They did it with different designs. The Schoolmen having set up
  the grand Mystery of Transubstantiation, were to exalt the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office as
  much as was possible: for the turning the Host into God was so great an action,
  that they reckoned there could be no Office higher than that which qualified a
  man to so mighty a Performance: therefore as they changed the form of
  Ordination from what it was Anciently believed to consist in, to a delivering
  of the Sacred Vessels, and held that a Priest had his Orders by that rite, and
  not by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands; so they raised their Order or Office so high
  as to make it equal with the Order of a Bishop: But as they designed to extol
  the Order of Priesthood, so the Canonists had as great a mind to depress the
  Episcopal Order. They generally wrote for preferment, and the way to it was to
  exalt the Papacy. Nothing could do that so effectually as to bring down the
  Power of Bishops. This only could justifie the Exemptions of the Monks and
  Friers, the Popes setting up Legantine Courts, and receiving at first Appeals,
  and then Original causes before them; together with many other Encroachments on
  their Jurisdiction: All which were unlawful, if the Bishops had by Divine
  right, Jurisdiction in their Dioceses: Therefore it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to lay them
  as low as could be, and to make them think that the Power they held, was rather
  as Delegates of the Apostolick See, than by a Commission from Christ or his
  Apostles: So that they looked on the declaring Episcopal Authority to be of
  Divine right, as a blow that would be fatal to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; and
  therefore they did after this at <hi>Trent</hi> use all possible endeavours to
  hinder any such Decision. It having been then the Common stile of that Age to
  reckon Bishops and Priests as the same Office, it is no wonder if at this time
  the Clergy of this Church, the greatest part of them being still leavened with
  the old superstition, and the rest of them not having enough of spare-time to
  examine lesser matters, retained still the former phrases in this
  par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>On this I have insisted the more, that it may appear how little
  they have considered things, who are so far carryed with their zeal against the
  established Government of this Church, as to make much use of some passages of
  the Schoolmen and Canonists that deny them to be distinct Offices; for these
  are the very dregs of Popery, the one rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Priests higher for the sake
  of Transubstantiation, the other pulling the Bishops lower for the sake of the
  Popes Supremacy, and <pb n="367" facs="tcp:104314:210"/> by such means bringing them almost
  to an equality. So partial are some men to their particular conceits, that they
  make use of the most mischievous Topicks when they can serve their turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  these Arguments will run if they ever admit them.</p>

               <p>The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> did always press the King to
  enter into a Religious League with them: the first League that was made in the
  year 1536 was conceived in general terms, against the Pope as the Common Enemy,
  and for setting up true Religion according to the Gospel: But they did
  afterwards send over Ambassadors to treat about particulars; and they having
  presented a Memorial of these, there were Conferences appointed between them
  and some Bishops and Divines of this Church. I find no Divines was sent over
  hither but <hi>Frederick Miconius</hi> Minister of <hi>Gotha,</hi> by whom
  <hi>Melanthon,</hi> who could not be spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Germany,</hi> sent
  several Letters to the King; the fullest and longest of them will be found in
  the Collection. It is all to this purpose,<note place="margin">Collect. Addenda
 <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.</note> to perswade the King to go on vigorously in the
  Reforming of Abuses according to the word of God. The King sent over the
  particulars which they proposed in order to a perfect agreement, to
  <hi>Gardiner</hi> who was then at <hi>Paris</hi>: Upon which he sent back his
  Opinion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all; the Original of which, under his own hand I have
  seen, but it relates so much to the other Paper that was sent him, which I
  never saw, that without it his meaning can hardly be understood, and therefore
  I have not put it in the Collection. The main thing in it, at which it chiefly
  drives, is to press the King to finish first a Civil League with them, and to
  leave those particulars concerning Religion to be afterwards treated of. The
  King followed his advice so far as to write to the <hi>German</hi> Princes to
  that effect. But when the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his resolution to have the six
  Articles established, all that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Reformation were much alarmed at
  it, and pressed their friends in <hi>Germany</hi> to interpose with the King
  for preventing it. I have seen an Original Letter of <hi>Hains</hi> Dean of
  <hi>Exeter,</hi> in which he laments the sad effects that would follow on that
  Act, which was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring; that all the Corruptions in the Church rose
  from the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some points without clear proofs from Scripture: he
  wished the <hi>Germans</hi> would consider of it, for if the King and
  Parliament should make such a Law, this was a President for the Emperor to make
  the like in the Diet of the Empire. Neither were the <hi>German</hi>
  Ambassadors back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in doing their friends in <hi>England</hi> all the
  service they could: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had held several conferences with these
  that were appointed by the King to treat with them; they finding they could not
  prevail with them, wrote a long and Learned Letter to the King, against the
  taking away the Chalice in the Sacrament, and against private Masses and the
  Celibate of the Clergy,<note place="margin">Collect. Addenda <hi>Numb.</hi>
 7.</note> with some other abuses which the Reader will find in the Collection,
  as it is Copied from the Original which I have seen. To this I have added the
  Answer which the King wrote to it: He employed <hi>Tonstall</hi> Bishop of
  <hi>Duresm</hi> to draw it,<note place="margin">Collect. Addenda <hi>Numb.</hi>
 8.</note> for I have seen a rude draught of a great part of it written with his
  hand. By <pb n="368" facs="tcp:104314:211"/> both these compared together, every indifferent
  Reader will clearly see the force and simplicity of the Arguments on the one
  hand, and the art and shuffling that was used on the other side. As soon as the
  Act was past, notwithstanding all their endeavours to the contrary, they in an
  Audience before the King, represented the great concern their Masters would
  have, when the King on whom they had relyed so much, as the Defender of the
  Faith, should proceed with the severity expressed in that Act, against those
  that agreed with them in Doctrine, and pressed the King earnestly to put a stop
  to the Execution of it. The King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised he would see to it, and that though
  he judged the Act neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to restrain the Insolence of some of his Subjects;
  yet it should not be Executed but upon great provocation: he also proposed the
  renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Civil League with them, without mentioning matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. To
  this the Princes made answer, that the League as it was at first projected, was
  chiefly upon a design of Religion, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a common consent of
  all that were in their League, they could not alter it: they lamented this
  passing of the late Act, but writ their thanks to the King for stopping the
  Execution of it, and warn'd him that some of his Bishops, who set him on to
  these courses, were in their hearts still for all the old Abuses, and for the
  Popes Supremacy, and were pressing on the King to be severe against his best
  Subjects, that they might thereby bring on a design which they could not hope
  to effect any other way: they advised the King to beware of such Counsels. They
  also proposed that there might be a Conference agreed on between such Divines
  as the King would name, and such as they should depute, to meet either in
  <hi>Gueldres, Hamburgh, Bremen,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place that should be
  appointed by the King, to examine the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of private Masses, of denying
  the Chalice, and the Prohibiting the Marriage of the Clergy. On these things
  they continued treating till the Divorce of <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve</hi> and
  <hi>Cromwells</hi> fall, after which I find little Correspondence between the
  King and them.</p>

  great Indiscretions: that the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion had been occasioned by them;
  therefore he required the Bishops to take care, that the Articles formerly

  and preach Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws, and the good ends of those Ceremonies that
  were then retained, that the people might neither despise them, nor put too
  much trust in them: and to silence all disputes and contentions concerning
  things indifferent; and to signifie to the Kings Council, if there were any
  Priests in their Diocesses that were Marryed, and yet did discharge any part of
  the Priestly Office. All which, will be better understood by the Letter it
  self, that I have put into the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>

               <p>I do there acknowledg that I knew not what Arguments were used
  against the necessity of Auricular Confession: But I have made since that time,
  a Considerable discovery in this particular, from an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Letter written
  all with the Kings own hand to <hi>Tonstal</hi>; by which it appears, there had
  been conferences in the House, and that the Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> the
  Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> and <hi>Duresm</hi> had plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much for it, as
  necessary by a Divine Institution, and that both the King and the Arch-Bishop
  of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had maintained, that though it was good and profitable,
  yet it was not necessary by any precept of the Gospel: and that though the
  Bishops brought several texts out of Scripture and Ancient Doctors, yet these
  were so clearly answered by the King, and the Arch-Bishop, that the whole House
  was satisfied with it: Yet <hi>Tonstall</hi> drew up in a writing all the
  reasons he had made use of in that debate, and brought them to the King,<note place="margin">Collect. Addenda <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.</note> which will be found in
  the Collection, with the Anotations and reflections which the King wrote on the
  Margent, with his own hand, taken from the Original;<note place="margin">Collect.
 Addenda <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.</note> together with the Kings Letter written in
  answer to them: By this it will appear that the King did set himself much to
  study points of Divinity, and examined matters with a scrupulous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness.
  The issue of the debate was, that though the Popish party endeavoured to have
  got Auricular Confession declared to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Christ, as a part of the
  Sacrament of Pennance; yet the King overruled that, so it was enacted that
  Auricular Confession <hi>was necessary and expedient to be retained in the
  Church of God.</hi> These debates were in the House of Lords, which appears not
  only by the Kings Letter, that speaks of the <hi>House,</hi> but by the Act of
  Parliament in the Preamble of which it is said, that the King had come himself
  to the Parliament, and had opened several points of high Learning to them.</p>

               <p>There I mention the Kings diligence in drawing an Act of
  Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his own hand; but since that was Printed, I have seen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
  other Acts and Papers, if not Originally Penned by the King, yet so much
  altered by his Corrections, that in some sort they may be esteemed his
  draughts. There are two draughts of the Act of the six Articles, both corrected
  in many places by the King, and in some of these the Correction is three lines
  long. There is another Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Precontracts of Marriage, likewise
  Corrected very much by his Pen. Many draughts of Proclamations, particularly
  these about the use of the Bible in <hi>English</hi> are yet extant interlined
  and altered with his Pen. There is a large Paper written by <hi>Tonstall,</hi>
  of arguments for Purgatory, with Copious Animadversions on it, likewise written
  by the King; which shew that then he did not believe there was a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. I

                        </gap>ulation of his
restitution unto liberty on yours and his behalf, to his singular comfort and
consolation; and so much the more, because that I was the first that made like
salutation in any great Princes Name; He being well assured that I spake the
same on the behalf of his two chief, sincere, &amp; unfeigned Friends:
Wherefore with great high thanks, and long <pb n="22" facs="tcp:104314:228"/> discourse,
with rehearsal of the King's and your Merits and Acts, in most vertuous and
Catholick manner, employed for his restitution, and your continual and
effectual study how the See Apostolique might recover the pristine Reputation
and Dignity; He confirmed as much as I had spoken. After this Mr.
<hi>Gregory</hi> and I entred into our Charge, shewing at length the high
deserts of the Princes and Realm of <hi>England,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the same
towards the Church; how expedient it was, as well for the See Apostolique, as
for the said Realm, to foresee and provide that all occasions of Dissension and
War were extinct and put away; which for lack of Heir Male of our Sovereign's
Line, and Stem, should undoubtedly follow, with other considerations at length
contained in our Instructions. We desired his Holiness to commit the knowledg
of the Dispensation that was obtained in time of <hi>Iulius,</hi> of famous
memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for Matrimony to be had between the King and the Widow, Relict late of
Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>; and that we might have it in form as that was that your
Grace sent hither. His Holiness answered, That our sayings had great likelihood
of truth, for lacking of Issue Male of the King's Stem, considering the nature
of Men being prone unto Novelties, and disposed unto Parties and Factions. The
Realm of <hi>England</hi> would not only enter into their accustomed Divisions,
but also would owe or do small devotion unto the Church; Wherefore his Holiness
was right well content and ready to adhibit all Remedy that in him was possible
as this time would serve. And because he was not expert in making of
Commissions, he would consult with the Cardinal <hi>Sanctorum Quatuor,</hi> and
use his advice, which we should shortly know.</p>
                     <p>We perceiving that the obtaining of our Charges after the
King's and your Graces pleasure, depended much upon the Advice of <hi>Sanctorum
Quatuor,</hi> did prevent his going unto the Pope and delivering your Grace's
Letters with Recommendations accordingly, we desired him to be good and
favourable unto our Requests in the King's behalf; and for the better obtaining
of our desires, we promised to see unto him with a competent reward. And this
communication had, we shewed unto him the Commission, which he said could not
pass without perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual dishonour unto the Pope, the King, and your Grace; and
a great part of such Clauses as be omitted, he hath touched and laid reason for
the same in a Writing, which I do send unto your Grace with this. Considering
his great Experience, Wisdom, Learning, and the entire affection that he
beareth unto the King and your Grace; and that it was far from the King's
desire, and nothing for your purposes, that I should first have sent the said
Cardinal's Sayings unto your Grace, and abide answer, and eft-soons prevent to
do the same: Considering also that the said King desireth a Commission
convenient and sufficient, we desired him to make the minute of one, which he
gladly did: When it was made, the Pope said, That at his being in the Castle of
St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> the General of the Observants in <hi>Spain,</hi> required
his Holiness, in the Emperor's Name, not to grant unto any Act that might be
preparative, or otherwise, to Divorce to be made between the King and the
Queen: and moreover desired an Inhibition, that the said Cause should not come
in knowledg before any Judg within the King's Dominions. The Pope answered that
<hi>Inhibitio non datur nisi post litem motam.</hi> And as unto the first his
Holiness was content, if any like thing were demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <pb n="23" facs="tcp:104314:228"/>
to advertise the Emperor before, that he did let it pass; and this was in a
manner for his Holiness being in Captivity. But his Holiness being yet in
Captivity, as your Grace reports, and esteemeth him to be as long as the
<hi>Almaines</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> continueth in <hi>Italy</hi>; he
thought if he should grant this Commission, that he should have the Emperor his
perpetual Enemy, without any hope of reconciliation: Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was
content rather to put himself in evident ruine, and utter undoing, then the
King, or your Grace, should suspect any point of ingratitude in him, heartily
desiring <hi>cum suspiriis &amp; lachrimis,</hi> that the King and your Grace,
which have always been fast and good unto him, will not now suddenly
precipitate him for ever; which should be done, if immediately upon delivering
of the Commission your Grace should begin Process. He intendeth to save all
upright thus: If <hi>Monsieur de Lautrech</hi> would set forwards, which he
saith daily that he will do, but yet he doth not, at his coming the Pope's
Holiness may have good colour to say, He was required by the Ambassadour of
<hi>England</hi> of a like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. And denying the same, because of his
promise unto the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, he was eft-soons by <hi>Monsieur de Lautrech,</hi>
to grant the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, inasmuch as it was but a Letter of Justice. And
by this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour he would cover the Matter, so that it might appear unto the
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, That the Pope did it not as he that would gladly do displeasure unto
the Emperor, but as an indifferent Prince that could not nor might deny
Justice, specially being required by such Personages; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately he would
dispatch a Commission, bearing date after the time that <hi>Monsieur
Lautrech</hi> had been with him or nigh unto him. The Pope most instantly
beseecheth your Grace, to be a mean that the King's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness may accept this
in a good part, and that he will take patience for this little time, which as
it is supposed will be but short, and <hi>(in omnem eventum)</hi> I do bring a
Commission with me, and a Dispensation, which I trust the King and your Grace
will like well.</p>

Quatuor</hi> 4000 Crowns, and unto the Secretary 30 Crowns.</p>

                     <head> To the KING.</head>
                     <p>PLease it your Highness to understand, That as soon as the
Pope was at liberty, and came unto <hi>Orvieto,</hi> I resorted unto his
Holiness with all diligence; and at my coming unto him, did make congratulation
on your Highness behalf; forasmuch as he was restored unto his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which
he accepted very joyfully and thankfully, giving unto your Highness manifold
and high thanks for your great goodness, as well proved in his adversity, as
when he was in his most felicity. After this he rehearsed my being at
<hi>Rome,</hi> how dangerous it was, inasmuch as when my being there was
detect, espial was made, and I was not passed out of <hi>Rome</hi> by the space
of two hours, or two hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded and searched the
House. He shewed also that he had received all such Letters as I at my being in
<hi>Rome</hi> did send unto his Holiness; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he did perceive the Effect
of your Highness desire concerning your Dispensation: And albeit he did send me
word that I should depart, and his Holiness would send unto me the said
Dispensation fully speed. Nevertheless he trusted that your Highness would be
content to tarry for a time: for the General of the Observants in
<hi>Spain</hi> being lately in <hi>Rome,</hi> had required him, according unto
his Instructions, that he should suffer nothing to pass that might be
prejudicial or against the Queen, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, but that the Pope
should first advertise thereof cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Caesarians</hi> here. And
forasmuch as this Dispensation might encourage your Grace to cause my Lord
Legate <hi>Auctoritate Legationis</hi> to hear and decern in the Cause that
your Highness intendeth, and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness standeth as yet in manner in
captivity and perplexity: His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness therefore besought your Grace to have
patience for a time, and it should not be long e're your Highness should have,
not only that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation, but any thing else that may lie in his power. I
replied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, That his Holiness had once granted it, and that I had
dispatched a Post, and made relation thereof, by my Writings, unto your
High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so that I could not imagine by what reason I might perswade unto you
that he would perform the promise that he had once broken. In conclusion; He
was content that your Highness should have it, but he would have it delivered
with this condition; That the <hi>Prothonotary</hi> and <hi>Gambora</hi> and I,
should beseech your Highness not to attempt any thing in your Cause against the
Queen, till such time as the Pope were frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his Liberty; which could not
be as long as the <hi>Almaynes</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> did thus reign in
<hi>Italy</hi>; and promise made, we should deliver the Dispensation: and in my
poor judgment, it was best always to be in possession of this Dispensation.
After this he shewed the Minute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cardinal <hi>Sanctorum Quatuor,</hi>
willing him to reform it according to the stile of this Court; which done, he
shewed it unto me, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter said, That he thought good I should depart,
because I rode but competent Journies, and the Prothonotary <hi>Gambora</hi>
should follow by Post and bring the Bull with him, which is of the same form
and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that your Highness's Minute is of: And if there be any thing
omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <pb n="25" facs="tcp:104314:229"/> or to be added, his Holiness is always content
to reform it, and to put it under the same date that the same Dispensation now
beareth; the Copy whereof I do send unto your Highness with this, the
Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion General and Protestation being void, because they were conceived
<hi>durante captivitate</hi> only. And here, on my behalf, none other thing
being to be done, I took my leave of the Pope and departed. At my coming unto
<hi>Scarperii</hi> near unto <hi>Bonony,</hi> I did meet with <hi>Thadeus</hi>
this Courier, which brought certain Expeditions Triplicat; the one unto the
Protho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notar <hi>Gambora,</hi> the other unto <hi>Gregory de Cassali,</hi> and
the third unto me; among which was a general Commission Triplicat, the one to
be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my Lord Legate; and if that could not be obtained, because my
Lord Legate might be thought partial, then the same to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto
<hi>Staphileius. Item</hi>; There was a Copy of a Dispensation, where I
perceived, by your Grace's Letter, that your pleasure was to have your
Dispensation in form, after the minute that <hi>Barlow</hi> brought, which was
then sped, and already passed; so remained nothing to be sped, but the
Commission your Highness pleases. This knowing, I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my Servants to
continue their Journey, and with one Servant and this Courier, I returned unto
<hi>Orvieto</hi> with Post-Horses; where Mr. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> and I, with much
Business, have obtained a Commission directed unto my Lord Legate, not in the
form that was conceived in <hi>England,</hi> but after such manner as is
sufficient for the Cause, and as I trust shall content your Highness; wherein
the Lord Cardinal <hi>Sanctorum Quatuor,</hi> hath taken great pains to pen, as
well your Dispensation as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; for which, and that hereafter he may
do unto your Highness the better service, Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> and I have
rewarded him with 4000 Crowns, of such Mony as your Highness hath caused to be
made unto <hi>Venice</hi> for the furtherance of your Causes. But albeit that
every thing is passed according to your Highness pleasure, I cannot see, but in
case the same be put in execution at this time, the Pope is utterly undone, and
so he saith himself. The <hi>Imperialists</hi> do daily spoil Castles and Towns
about <hi>Rome; Monsieur de Lautrek</hi> is yet at <hi>Bonony,</hi> and small
hope is of any great Act that he intends. The <hi>Caesarians</hi> have taken
within these three days, two Castles lying within six miles of this: and the
Pope being in this perplexity, not assured of any one Friend but of your
Highness, that lieth too far off; if he do at this time any displeasure unto
the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, he thinketh he is undone for ever; wherefore he puts his Honour
and Health wholly into your Highness Power and Disposition. This morning I
return homewards, and <hi>Gregory de Cassali</hi> goeth in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as far
as unto <hi>Florence</hi>; and from thence he goeth unto <hi>Monsieur de
Lautrek,</hi> to sollicit him forwards, if it may be. The Holy Ghost send your
Highness a prosperous New Year, and many.</p>

 for any other thing that could not be obtained without long tract, and

 Vannes</hi> his Instructions, directing him to threaten the Pope. An
 Original.</head>
                  <p>— ANd <hi>Peter,</hi> as of himself, shall a-part say
 unto his Holiness; Sir, I being an <hi>Italian,</hi> cannot but with a more
 fervent zeal and mind than any other, study and desire the Weal, Honour, and 
 <pb n="48" facs="tcp:104314:241"/> Safety of your Holiness and the See Apostolick; which
 compelleth me to shew unto your Holiness, frankly, what I see in this matter.
 Surely, Sir, in case your Holiness continuing this particular respect of fear
 of the Emperor, do thus delay, protract, and put off the accomplishment of the
 King's so instant desire in this Matter, and not impart to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty therein
 bounteously of the Treasure and Goods of the Church, and the See Apostolick,
 <hi>quantum potestis ex Thesauro Ecclesiae &amp; ex ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudine Potestatis ac
 Autoritate a Deo vel ab Ecclesia collata.</hi> I see assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it will
 be a means so to alienate the fast and entire mind which his Highness beareth
 to your said Holiness, as not not only thereby his Grace, Nobles, and Realm,
 but also many other Princes his Friends and Confederates, with their Nobles and
 Realms, shall withdraw their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and Obedience from your Holiness, and
 the See Apostolick, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying how they may acquite this your Ingratitude, in
 the highest cause that can be devised, shewed, and so long continued with the
 sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And therefore, Sir, at the reverence of Almighty God, cast not from
 you the heart of this noble virtuous Prince, who finally cannot fail, the Peace
 had, which Christendom may not long forbear, to have in his puissance, such a
 stay as may be able, in the highest and largest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to recompence his
 Friends, and to acquite the contrary.</p>

 notorium est; &amp; tacita ad hunc modum aetate, mendacium pro causa suggestum
 est manifestissimum; Cupiisse, <hi>viz.</hi> tunc Serenissimum Regem contrahere
 Matrimonium, ad hoc ut pacis foedera continuarentur: facti veritas est, tum
 quid agere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ignorasse, &amp; etiamsi tum scivisset, tamen non fuisse verum
 quod cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peret ad hoc ut pacis foedera continuarentur, aetas ostendit, quae per
 communis juris dispositionem discretionem non admittit; cupere quidem affectus
 est, caeterum cupere contrahere Matrimonium, ad hoc ut pacis foedera
 continuarentur, judicii est &amp; discretionis. Porro autem, quum de
 continuandis inter duos Principes foederibus ageretur, alter ante man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datam
 exequutioni Bullam fatis concessit, &amp; re integra, causa, si quae fuit,
 cessavit.</p>

 deinde Breve falsum esse, &amp; pro falso judicari deberi, multis rationibus
 convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur; denique falsum cum sit, &amp; tamen prioris Bullae errores
 corrigat, illam opinionem merito confirmet, ne prior Dispensatio efficax
 videatur, vel eorum judicio, qui hoc Matrimonium defendere studuerunt, viz. qui
 veris allegationibus diffisi, ad falsas &amp; confictas Dispensationes, vitia
 ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecta removentes confugere coacti sunt.</p>
                  <p>Ista, si singula minus sufficiant, saltem collata, obtineant
 &amp; persuade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant licere. Illa vero opinio multis persuasa, Pontificem, viz.
 non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuisse dispensare, ut sola infirmet Dispensationem, non petitur, sed
 habet nihilominus aliquid considerationis; quanquam enim refellatur a
 qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busdam &amp; reprobetur, manet tamen scripta, atque adeo testimonio ipsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us

 depend so many high Consequences, as for no earthly Cause to suffer or

 amendment or danger of life; nor as is aforesaid, oweth to be by his Holiness
 preteromitted, whether the same be in the state of Recovery, or in any doubt or
 despair thereof: for one assured and principal fundamental and ground is to be
 regarded, whereupon the King's Highness doth plant and build his Acts and
 Cogitations in this behalf, which is from the reasonable favour and justice,
 being the things from the which the Pope's Holiness, <hi>in prosperis nec
 adversis,</hi> may lawfully and honestly digress; and when the plainness of his
 Cause is well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, with the manifest Presumptions, Arguments, and
 Suspitions, both of the insufficiency of the Bull, and falsity of the Brief,
 such as may lead any Man of reason or intendment, well to perceive and know,
 that no sufficiency or assured truth can be therein; How may the Pope's
 Holiness, <hi>ex aequo &amp; justo,</hi> refuse or deny to any Christian Man,
 much less to a Prince of so high merits, and in a Cause whereupon depend so
 many consequences, to his Holiness well known, for a vain respect of any
 Person, or by excuse of any Sickness, justifie, colour, or defend any manner
 refusal, tract, or delay, used in declaration of the truth in so great a
 Matter, which neither for the infinite conveniences that thereby might ensue,
 admitteth or suffereth to be delaied, nor by other than himself, his Act or
 Authority, may lawfully be declared. And well may his Holiness know, That to
 none it appertaineth more to look unto the justness of the King's desire in
 this behalf, than to his Highness his self, whose Interest, whose Cause, with
 the same of his Realm and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession resteth herein; for if his Grace were
 minded, or would intend to do a thing inique or injust, there were no need to
 recurr unto the Pope's Holiness for doing thereof. But because his Highness and
 his Council, who best know the whole of this Matter, and to whose part 
 <pb n="52" facs="tcp:104314:243"/> it belongeth most profoundly to weigh and ponder every
 thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same, be well assured of the truth of the Matter, needing
 none other thing but for observance of his Duty towards God and his Church, to
 have the same Truth also approbate and declared by him to whom the doing
 thereof appertaineth; his Grace therefore seeing an untruth alleadged, and that
 so craftily as by undue and perverse ways, the same, without good reason
 adhibited, may for a season bring things into confusion, doth communicate unto
 the Pope's Holiness presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and evidences enough, and sufficient to
 inform the Conscience of his Holiness of the very truth: which then, if his
 Holiness will not see, but either for affection, fear, or other private cause,
 will hearken to every dilatory and vain allegation of such as led upon undue
 grounds would colour the Truth; What doth his Holiness less therein, than
 un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a right vain colour expresly deny and refuse the said Justice, which to
 be done either in health or sickness, in a matter of so great moment, is in no
 wise tolerable? But for the same reasons that be before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the
 thing, whether the Pope's Holiness be in hope or despair of life, without
 further tract to be absolved and determined; for if Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God grant his
 Holiness life, this Act is, and always shall be, able to bear it self, and is
 meet to be an Example, a President, and a Law, in all like Cases emerging, the
 Circumstances and Specialities of the same in every part concurring as they do
 in this; nor can the Emperor make exceptions at the same, when he best knowing,
 percase, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth shall see the grounds and occasions, that of necessity
 and meer Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice have enforced and constrained the Pope's Holiness thereunto;
 which he could not refuse to do, unless he would openly and manifestly commit
 express injury and notorious injustice. For be it that the Pope's Holiness
 hearkning to the said frivolous and vain Allegations, would refuse to declare
 the Law herein to the King's purpose, then must his Holiness, either standing
 in doubt, leave and suffer the Cause to remain in suspence to the extream
 danger of the King's Realm and Succession for ever, or else declare the Bull or
 Breve, or both to be good, which I suppose neither his Holiness nor any true
 Christian Man can do, standing the manifest occasions, presumptions, and
 apparent evidences to the contrary. Then if the matter be not to be left in
 suspence, no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be truly given to the approbation of the Bull or
 Breve; how can the Pope's Holiness of Conscience, Honour or Vertue, living or
 dying, thus procrastinate or put over the immediate finishing thereof,
 ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the King's desire? or how may his Holiness find his Conscience
 towards God exonerate, if either living he should be the cause of so many evils
 as hereof may arise; or dying, wilfully leave this so great a Matter, by his
 own default, in this confusion, incertainty and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? It is not to be
 supposed, that ever Prince most devout to the See Apostolick, could so long
 tolerate so high an Injury, as being so meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards the said See, is both
 unacquitted for his kindness with any special Grace, and also denied upon his
 petition of that, which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be plain Justice. This thing is
 otherwise to be looked upon, than for the Pope's Sickness, where most need were
 to put an end unto it, to be delaied, seeing that living and amending, it is of
 it self expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and justifiable, and dying, it shall be an act both
 necessary, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious and honourable. For this cause ye now knowing the
 King's <pb n="53" facs="tcp:104314:243"/> mind in this behalf, shall, if ye have not already
 before this time spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the Pope's Holiness at length in these Matters,
 as the King's Grace trusteth ye have done, sollicite as well by the means of
 <hi>Messiere Iacobo Salviati,</hi> as by the Bishop of <hi>Verone,</hi> and
 otherwise as ye can think best, to have such commodious access unto his
 Holiness, as ye may declare the Premises unto him; which by your wisdoms, in as
 ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and vive manner as ye can open it unto his Holiness. It is
 un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to be thought the same shall rather be to his comfort and
 en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Health, than to any his trouble or unquietness; and that his
 Holiness hearing these Reasons not evitable, will, whether he be in way and
 hope of amendment, or otherwise, both proceed to the said indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and also
 to the Declaration of the Law, and passing of a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and ample Decretal,
 as hath been devised in the King's said Cause, with other such things, as by
 former Letters and Instructions, by the Decrees mentioned in the same, that
 failing have been committed unto you, to be solicited and procured there; in
 the labouring where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, albeit since your departures from hence, the things
 have, by reasons of the Pope's sore sickness, otherwise chanced than was here
 supposed, by means whereof ye not instructed what to do in any such case, were
 peradventure not over-hasty or importune to labour these Matters, till the
 Pope's Holiness might be better amended, nor could percase find the means to
 have convenient access unto his presence for the same, ye must nevertheless
 adhibit such diligence, as howsoever the sickness of his Holiness shall cease,
 amend, or continue, these things be not for the same, or any other cause,
 tracted or left in longer suspense; but finding possible means to come unto the
 Pope's presence, to declare all such things unto the same, mentioned both in
 the former Letters and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions given unto you, and also in these
 presents, as may make to the purpose; and failing of often access in your own
 Persons to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, ye cause the Bishop of <hi>Verone,</hi> and other
 such assured Friends as ye can attain, being about him at such times as they
 may have with his Holiness, to inculcate unto him the said Points and
 Considerations, and all other that ye can excogitate and devise to the
 furtherance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of these Matters, not forbearing or sparing also,
 if ye shall see difficulty at the Pope's hand, or in audience to be given to
 you or your Friends there, being about his Person, to break and open after a
 good fashion and manner the same unto such of the Cardinals, as ye may perceive
 assuredly and constantly to favour the King's Highness, and the <hi>French</hi>
 King in Election of a future Pope, in case (as God forbid) the Pope's Holiness
 should decease; and to shew unto the same Cardinals, all such things as you
 shall think meet, both for their more ample instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the truth and
 specialities of the Matters, as well concerning the Indication of Truce, as the
 King's said Cause, and the presumptuous Reasons, and plainer Evidences, leading
 to the insufficiency of the Bull, and apparent falsity of the said Breve; to
 the intent, that as many of the said Cardinals as ye can win, made sure in
 those Matters, they may, both in time of sickness, and also of amendment, move
 and induce the Pope's Holiness thereunto, laying before him as well the Merits
 and Honour that may ensue by the perfection of the Premises, as the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
 imminent by the contrary: and semblably it shall be expedient that ye win and
 make sure to the same purpose, as many of the Officers of <pb n="54" facs="tcp:104314:244"/>
 the <hi>Rota</hi> and other as ye can, who as ye write be not accustomed, nor
 will give counsel to any Person but the Pope's Holiness; for albeit, ye cannot
 have them to be of the King's Council, yet nevertheless they may do as much
 good, or more, in training and counselling the Pope's Holiness, upon the great
 Reasons that you can shew unto them, to hearken unto your Overtures in this
 behalf. To which purpose you shall adjure, make, and win, as many Friends of
 the Cardinals, of them, and other, as ye possibly may, as for the thing which
 the King's Highness and I more esteem than twenty Papalities; and amongst
 other, ye shall insist, by all means and good persuasions ye can, for the
 continuance there of the said Bishop of <hi>Verone,</hi> so as he may
 countervail the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puan</hi>; who, as it seemeth, is
 continually about the Pope's Person, and were necessary to be met with in the
 labours and persuasions, which by likelihood he maketh to the hindrance of the
 King's Purpose: For the better continuing of the which Bishop of
 <hi>Verone,</hi> not only the King's Highness and I write unto him at this
 time, as by the Copy of the same several Letters being herewith ye shall
 perceive, but also the <hi>French</hi> King will do the semblable. And
 furthermore, to the intent that the Pope's Holiness may well perceive, that not
 only the said <hi>French</hi> King mindeth the King's said Cause, and taketh it
 to heart as much as it were his own, and will effectually join and concur with
 the King's Highness therein, but that also he is and will be conformable to the
 said Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; He will send thither, with all speed, the Bishop of
 <hi>Bayon</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sollicite, and set forth the same; who, before his
 departure from hence, which was a good season passed, was and is sufficiently
 and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply instructed in all things requisite to this purpose; and not only in
 these Matters, but also in such other as were written unto you by <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
 de Cassalis,</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> upon advertisement given hither that
 the Pope's Holiness was deceased; so as ye may be sure to have of him
 ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual concurrence and advice in the furtherance and sollicitation of your
 Charges, whether the Pope's Holiness amend, remain long sick, or (as God
 forbid) should fortune to die; trusting, that being so well furnished by all
 ways that can be devised, ye will not fail to use such diligence as may be to
 the consecuting and attaining of the King's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: wherein, tho ye be so
 amply and largely instructed, that more cannot be, yet nevertheless having
 lately received from the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> a Memorial of divers
 great things to be well noted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, for trial of the falsity of the
 said Brieve, I send you herewith a Copy of the same Memorial, to the intent ye
 substantially visiting and perusing the same, may follow and put in execution
 such part thereof, for better trial of the falsity, as is to be done there,
 like as the rest meet to be done here, shall not fail to be executed with
 diligence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                  <p>Thus be ye with these, and other former Writings, sufficiently
 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed what is to be done by you there, whether the Pope's Holiness
 continue long in his sickness, or whether the same fortune to decease, or soon,
 God willing, to amend. There resteth no more, but that ye always take for a
 perfect ground, That tho to every new chance not before known, sufficient
 Provision and Instruction could not be given to you at your departure, ye
 always note, remember, and regard, That this the King's Cause admitteth nor
 suffereth any manner negative, <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104314:244"/> tract, or delay; wherefore
 knowing that so well as ye do, and also how much the Indiction of the Truce
 shall be commodious and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, both to the King's Highness in particular,
 and to all Christendom in general, by means whereof his Grace shall avoid
 Contribution, and other Charges of the War, ye must now, if ever you will have
 thanks, laud, or praise for your Service, employ your selves <hi>opportune
 &amp; impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> to put an end to the Points to the King's satisfaction
 and desire; and in every difficulty to study, by your Wisdoms, the best and
 next Remedy, and not always to tract your doings, till upon your Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
 hither, ye shall have new knowledg from hence: For thereby the matter it self,
 and also your demur there, be of over-long a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and infinite
 inconveniences by the same may ensue. I therefore require you, according to the
 special trust and confidence that the King's Highness and I have in you, now
 for ever to acquit your selves herein with all effect possible, accordingly so
 as the King's Highness be not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger kept in this perplexity and suspence, to
 his Graces intolerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietness, and the great heaviness of all those that
 observe and love the same.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, tho it so be that the King's Trust, and also mine
 is, Ye will by your Wisdom find such good means and ways as ye shall not fail,
 God willing, to open and declare unto the Pope's Holiness, the whole of the
 King's Mind, and all and singular the Premisses, with the residue
 above-mentioned in your former Instructions and Letters sent unto you: Yet
 nevertheless considering what ye wrote of the doubt of continuance of the
 Pope's sickness, and to make sure for all Events and Chances, in case his
 Holiness (as God forbid) should long remain in such state, as he might either
 take upon him the naming of the Peace, journying and repairing to the sacre
 Diet, nor also hear the whole of the things by you to be opened and propounded
 touching the King's said Cause; It hath been thought to the King's Highness
 convenient, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than these great and weighty Matters should hang in longer
 su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense, to excogitate some other good means and way how these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, so
 necessary, may by some ways be conduced and brought to an end: And it is this;
 That the Pope's Holiness not being able to travel to the place devised, where
 the Princes may be near him for Treaty, and managing of the Peace, he do depute
 me and my Lord Cardinal <hi>Campegius, conjunctim &amp; divisim,</hi> as his
 Legats for that purpose, to do and execute all such things in his Holiness's
 Name, as the same should do in that behalf if he were there present; whereunto,
 for the well of Christendom, we shall be contented to condescend. So always,
 that as hath been written heretofore unto you, before I pass or set forth to
 any Convention or Place, to the intent before specified, the Kings Highness be
 fully satisfied and pleased in his said matter of Matrimony, without which,
 neither with nor without the Pope's presence, I will ever begin or take that
 Voyage: for performance whereof, this Article following is of new devised, to
 be by you propounded unto his Holiness, if the Decretals cannot be obtained, or
 some other thing, that ye shall well know and perceive, by advice of expert
 Counsel there, to be better to the Kings purpose than this thing now devised,
 and that may without tract be passed or granted; that is to say, That his
 Holiness do enlarge, extend, and amplify his Commission given to me and my Lord
 Legate <pb n="56" facs="tcp:104314:245"/> 
                     <hi>Campegius,</hi> whereby we jointly and
 severally may be sufficiently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and authorized, to do as much in this
 cause of Matrimony, with all the emergents and dependencies upon the same, as
 his Holiness may do of his ordinary and absolute Power, with sufficient and
 ample Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>ad Decernend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; Interpretand. jura, leges, &amp;
 Rescripta quae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

 be, to exhibit and produce any manner Witness, Records, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, Rescripts,
 or other thing, in what place, or time we, or the one of us shall require them,
 or any of them in this behalf, with all and singular the Circumstances
 requisite and necessary to such a Commission, after such ample and assured
 manner, as the same once had, we shall not need for any Objections, doubt, or
 other thing that might infringe or lack, to send of new to the Pope's Holiness
 for other provision, whereby the King's said Cause might hang in any longer
 tract or delay. In which case of coming to this Commission, ye Mr.
 <hi>Stevins</hi> must have special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to see the same sufficiently and
 substantially penned, by advice of the most expert Men that ye can find to that
 purpose: For the better doing whereof, I send unto you herewith a Copy of the
 said Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to me and my Lord <hi>Campegius,</hi> with certain Additions
 thereunto noted in the Margin, such as have been here devised; and also a Copy
 of certain Clauses in a Bull, to the intent ye may see how amply the same be
 couched, to avoid appellations and other delays in Causes of far less moment
 and importance than the King's is. Nevertheless ye must, if it shall come to
 the obtaining of this new Commission, see to the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and more fully
 perfecting thereof, so as the same may be in due perfection, without needing to
 send eftsoons for remedying of any thing therein, as is aforesaid; looking also
 substantially whether the Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of Policitation, being already in your
 hands, be so couched, as the Date, and every thing considered, it may
 sufficiently oblige and astringe the Popes Holiness to confirm all that we, or
 one of us, shall do, by virtue of this New or the Old Commission: And if it be
 not of such efficacy so to do, then must ye in this case see, that either by
 suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and ample words to be put in this new Commission, if it may be so
 had, or by a new Chirograph the Pope's Holiness may be so astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; which
 Chirograph, with the Commissions before specified, if ye obtain the same, the
 King's pleasure is, That ye Sir <hi>Francis Brian</hi> shall bring hither, in
 all possible diligence, after the having and obtaining thereof, solliciting
 nevertheless, whether the Pope be to be facilly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with, or not, the
 immediate Indication of the Truce, as is aforesaid, without which in vain it
 were for me, either with or without the Pope, to travel for labouring and
 conducing of the Peace. And so by this way should the Pope's Holiness, with his
 merit and sufficient justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proceed for the Truce, as a fundament of
 Universal Peace, satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the King's desires, and avoid any doubt of the
 Emperor; forasmuch as his Holiness might alledg, That being so extreamly sick,
 that he was not able to know of the Cause himself, he could no less do of
 ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, than to commit it unto other, seeing that the same is of such 
 <pb n="57" facs="tcp:104314:245"/> importance as suffereth no tract or delay. And finally,
 the King's Highness, God willing, by this means, should have an end of this
 Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. One thing ye shall well note, which is this; Albeit this new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
 was now for doubt of the Pope's long continuance in sickness, first excogitate;
 yet is it not meant, nor ye be limited to this Device, in case ye can obtain
 any other, nor ye be also commanded, to prefer this before all the other
 Devices: but now that ye shall see and understand what this Device is, and
 knowing what thing is like or possible to be obtained there, without long
 putting over of your pursuits, expend, consider, and regard well with your
 self, what thing of this, or any other that may best serve to the brief and
 good expedition of the King's Cause. So always that it be a thing sure,
 sufficient, and available to his Grace's Purpose, that may without any further
 tract be there had; and then by your Wisdom taking unto you the best Learned
 Counsel that ye can have there, leave you to the expedition of that which so
 may be most meet, as the times require and suffer, to the brief furnishing of
 the King's said Cause to this purpose, without tract or delay, and that ye may
 see is the thing, which as the matter stands, can speedily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and
 sped, as is aforesaid. For whether the Decretal be better than this, or this
 better than that, or which soever be best, far it shall be from Wisdom to
 stick, and still to rest upon a thing that cannot be obtained; but since ye
 know the King's meaning, which is to have a way sufficient and good for the
 speedy finishing of this Cause to his Grace's purpose, note ye now, and
 consider with your self, by advice of Learned Counsel, as is aforesaid, how ye
 may bring that to pass, and shall ye deserve as high thanks as can be possible.
 So always that it be so well provided and looked upon, that in it be no such
 limitations or defaults, as shall compel us any more to write or send for
 reformation thereof: And coming to this Commission, tho percase ye can by no
 means or sticking have it in every point as the Copy, which I send you with the
 Annotations do purport; yet shall ye not therefore refuse it, but take it, or
 any other thing as can be had, after such form as may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially serve, and
 as ye can by your wisdom and good sollicitations obtain, for the speedy
 finishing of the King's Cause to his purpose, as is aforesaid, which is the
 scope whereunto we must tend at this time; and therefore ye be not limited or
 coacted within any such bounds as ye should thereby be compelled or driven, for
 lack of obtaining any thing or point mentioned in these or other your
 Instructions, or former Writings, to send hither again for further knowledg of
 the King's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; but ye be put at liberty so to qualify, so to add,
 detray, immix, change, chuse or mend as ye shall think good; so always that ye
 take the thing that best can be had, being such as may as effectually as ye can
 bring about, serve to the King's purpose, and to put indelayed end to it,
 according to his Grace's desire, without further tract, or sending thither,
 which is as much as here can be said or devised. And therefore at the reverence
 of Almighty God, bring us out of this perplexity, that this Vertuous Prince may
 have this thing sped to the purpose desired, which shall be the most joyous
 thing that this day in Earth may chance and succeed to my heart; and therefore
 I eftsoons beseech you to regard it accordingly: Howbeit if the Pope's Holiness
 refusing all your desires, shall make difficulty and delay therein, it is an
 evident sign and token, <pb n="58" facs="tcp:104314:246"/> that his Holiness is neither
 favourable to the King's reasonable Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor indifferent, but should
 thereby show himself both partial, and expresly averse unto his Grace;
 wherefore in that case finding in his Holiness such unreasonableness, as it can
 in no wise be thought ye shall do, The King's pleasure is, that ye proceed to
 the Protestations mentioned in the first Instructions given to you Mr.
 <hi>Stevins,</hi> for you and the residue of your Collegues; and that ye not
 only be plain and round with the Pope's Holiness therein, if ye come to his
 speech, but also ye show and extend unto the Cardinals, and other that be your
 Friends, which may do any good with him, the great peril and danger imminent
 unto the Church and See Apostolick; thereby exhorting them, That they like
 vertuous Fathers have regard thereunto, and not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Pope's Holiness,
 if he would thus wilfully, without reason or discretion to precipitate himself
 and the said See, which by this refusal is like to suffer ten times more
 detriment, than it could do for any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment that the Emperor could take
 with the contrary: for ye shall say, sure they may be, and so I for my
 discharge declare, both to the Pope's Holiness and to them, If this Noble and
 Vertuous Prince, in this so great and so reasonable a Cause, be thus extreamly
 denied of the grace and lawful favour of the Church, the Pope's Holiness shall
 not fail for the same to lose Him and his Realm, the <hi>French</hi> King and
 his Realm, with many other their Confederates; besides those that having
 particular Quarrels to the Pope, and so aforesaid will not fail, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
 other, as they daily seek occasions, and provoke the King's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
 thereunto, which will do the semblable, being a thing of another sort to be
 regarded, than the respect to the Emperor; for two Cities, which nevertheless
 shall be had well enough, and the Emperor neither so evil contented, nor so
 much to be doubted herein, as is there sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, This, with other words
 mentioned in your Instructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning like matter, ye shall declare unto
 his Holiness, and to the said Cardinals, and other being your Friends, if it
 come to that point; whereby it is not to be doubted, but they perceiving the
 dangers afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, shall be glad to exhort and induce his Holiness, for the
 well of himself and the Church, to condescend to the King's desire; which is as
 much as can be here thought or devised, to be by you done in all Events and
 Chances: And therefore I pray you, eft-soons, and most instantly require you,
 as afore, to handle this Matter with all effect possible. Coming to this new
 Commission, when you shall have once attained such thing as shall be sufficient
 for the King's purpose, as is aforesaid; and that ye have it in your hands and
 custody, and not afore, lest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye might hinder the expedition thereof,
 ye shall by all ways and means possible, labour and insist, That the King's
 Highness, as need shall be, may use and enjoy the benefit of the Decretal,
 being already in my Lord Cardinal <hi>Campegius</hi>'s hands, whereunto his
 Highness and I desire you to put all your effectual labour for the attaining of
 the Pope's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereunto accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Ye shall furthermore understand, That it is thought here, in
 case, as God forbid, the Pope should die before ye should have impetrate any
 thing that may serve to the absolution of the King's Matter, That the Colledg
 of Cardinals have Authority, Power, and Jurisdiction, <hi>sede 
 <pb n="59" facs="tcp:104314:246"/> vacante,</hi> to inhibit, avoke, <hi>&amp; ex
 consequenti,</hi> to pass and decide the King's Matter, seeing that the same is
 of so high moment and importance, concerning the surety of a Prince and his
 Realm, as more amply ye shall perceive in the Chapters, <hi>ubi Periculum de
 Electione, ne Romani, de Iure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurando, &amp; capite primo de Scismaticis</hi>;
 Wherefore the King's pleasure is, That ye Mr. <hi>Stevins</hi> shall diligently
 weigh and ponder the effect of the said Chapters, not only with your self, but
 also with such the King's Learned Counsel as ye and your Collegues have
 conducted there; and what Jurisdiction, <hi>sede vacante,</hi> the Colledg of
 Cardinals have, either by the Common Law, usage or prescription, which may far
 better be known there than here: And if ye find that the Cardinals have in this
 the King's Cause, and such other like Authority and Jurisdictions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite,
 avoke and decern, then, <hi>in casu mortis Pontificis, quod Deus aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat,</hi>
 ye shall specially foresee and regard that for none Intercession or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute
 made by the Emperor and his Adherents, they shall either inhibit or avoke: And
 also if before such Death, ye shall not have obtained such thing to the Kings
 desire and purpose, as these present Letters before do purport, his Grace's
 pleasure is, That ye shall pursue the effectual expedition of the same, at the
 hands of the said Colledg, <hi>Sede vacante, ne res quae nullam dilationem
 exposcit, tantopere usque ad Electionem novi Pontificis quoquam modo
 differatur</hi>; using for this purpose all such Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Allegations, and
 Persuasions mentioned in those Letters, and your former Instructions, as ye
 shall see and perceive to serve to that effect; and so to endeavour and acquit
 your self, that such things may be attained there, as may absolve this the
 King's Matter, without any further tract or delay; whereby ye shall as afore
 highly deserve the King's and my special thanks, which shall be so acquitted,
 as ye shall have cause to think your pains and diligences therein in the best
 wise imployed, trusting in God that howsoever the World shall come, ye shall by
 one means or other bring the King's Matter, which so highly toucheth his Honour
 and quiet of Mind, unto the desired end and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>Finally; Ye shall understand that the <hi>French</hi> King,
 among other things, doth commit at this time to the Bishop of <hi>Bayon,</hi>
 and Mr. <hi>Iohn Ioachim</hi> to treat and conclude the Confederation
 heretofore spoken of, between his Holiness and the King's Highness, the
 <hi>French</hi> King, the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> and other Potentates of
 <hi>Italy,</hi> for a continual Army to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained to invade
 <hi>Spain</hi> in case it stand by the Emperor, that the Peace shall not take
 effect: Wherefore the King's pleasure is, That ye having conference with them
 at good length in that Matter, do also for your parts, sollicite, procure, and
 set forth the same; entring also on the King's behalf unto the Treaty, and
 conclusion thereof, after such manner as your former Instructions and Writings
 do purport. So as like as the <hi>French</hi> King is determined, that his
 Agents shall join and concur with you in the King's Pursuits and Causes; So ye
 must also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with them in advancement of their Affairs, the successes
 whereof, and of all other your doings there, it shall be expedient ye more
 often notify hitherto than ye do, for many times in one whole month no knowledg
 is had from you, which is not meet in those so weighty Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, specially
 considering that sometime by such as pass to <hi>Lyons,</hi> ye 
 <pb n="60" facs="tcp:104314:247"/> might find the means to send your Letters, which should
 be greatly to the King's and my consolation, in hearing thereby from time to
 time, how the things succeed there; I pray you therefore to use more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
 therein, as the Kings and my special trust is in you. And hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fare you
 well. From my Palace besides <hi>Westminster,</hi> the sixth day of

11.</note>RIght well beloved Friends, I commend me unto you in my hearty
 manner, letting you wit, that by the hands of <hi>Thadeus</hi> bearer hereof,
 the King's Highness hath received your several Letters to the same, directed
 with the Pope's Pollicitation mentioned in the same, and semblablie I have
 received your Conjunct and several Letters of the date of the 18 and 29 days of
 <hi>March</hi>; the 8, 19, 20, and 22 of <hi>April,</hi> to me directed,
 wherein ye at right good length have made mention of such Discourses,
 Conferences, Audiences and Communications as ye have had concerning your
 Charge, since the time of your former Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements made in that behalf, with
 all such Answers and Replications as have been made unto you by the Pope's
 Holiness, and other on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half concerning the same. In the Circumstances
 whereof ye have so diligently, discreetly, and substantially, acquitted your
 selves, as not only your firm and fervent desire, to do unto the King's
 Highness spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and singular service in this his great and weighty Cause, but
 also your Wisdom, Learning, and perfect dexterities, heretofore well known,
 hath every one for his part thereby been largely of new shewed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate and
 declared to the King's good contentment, my rejoice and gladness, and to your
 great laud and praise. For the which his Grace giveth unto you right hearty
 thanks, and I also for my part do the sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable; assuring you, in few words,
 though the time and state of things hath not suffered that your desires might
 at this time be brought unto effect, yet the King's Grace well knoweth,
 perceiveth, and taketh, that more could not have been done, excogitated, or
 devised, than ye have largely endeavoured your self unto for conducing the
 King's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, which his Grace accepteth, as touching your merits and
 acquittal <pb n="61" facs="tcp:104314:247"/> in no less good and thankful part, than if ye
 finding the disposition of things in more direct state, had consecute all your
 pursuits and desires: Nor ye shall doubt or think, that either the King's
 Highness or I have conceived, or thought any manner negligence in you for such
 things as were mentioned, in the last Letters sent unto you by
 <hi>Alexander,</hi> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, but that albeit his Highness had cause, as the
 same wrote, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of your long demor, and lack of expedition of one or
 other of the things committed to your charge; yet did his Highness right well
 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade unto himself the default not to be in you, but in some other cause,
 whereof his Grace not knowing the same, might justly and meritoriously be
 brought unto admiration, and marvel: And therefore be ye all of good comfort,
 and think your perfect endeavours used, and services done, to be employed
 there, as it can right well, in every part regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and considered.</p>
                  <p>In effect coming to the Specialities of the things now to be
 answered, The King's Highness having groundly noted and considered the whole
 continue and circumstances of all your said Letters and Advertisements, findeth
 and perceiveth evidently, that whatsoever Pursuits, and Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and
 Requests have been, or shall be for this present time, made there by you on his
 Grace's behalf to the Pope's Holiness, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the said great
 and weighty Cause; and how much soever the necessity of Christendom for the
 good of Peace, the importance of the Matter, the justness of the thing it self,
 reason, duty, respect to good Merits, detecting of Falsities used, evident
 Arguments and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions to the same, or other thing whatsoever it be,
 making for the King's purpose, do weigh; the Times be now such, as all that
 shall be done in any of the Premisses there, is apparent by such privy
 Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and promise as is between the Pope and the Emperor, to hang and
 depend upon the Emperor's Will, Pleasure, and Arbitre, as whom the Pope's
 Holiness neither dare nor will in any part displease, offend, or miscontent,
 nor do by himself any thing notable therein, which he shall think or suppose to
 be of moment, the said Emperor first inconsulted, or not consenting thereunto.
 And for that cause, since the Emperor not only is the Adversary of Universal
 Peace, Letter, and Impeacher there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but also, as hath appeared by sundry
 Letters heretofore, and now of new sent out of <hi>Spain,</hi> doth shew
 himself adverse, and enterponing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as a Party against the King's said
 great Matter; It were in manner all one to prosecute the same at the Emperor's
 hands, as at the Popes, which so totally dependeth upon the Emperor; and as
 much Fruit might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of the one as of the other, so as far discrepant it
 were from any wisdom in a thing so necessary, and which as ye know must needs
 be brought unto an end without any further delay, to consume and spend the
 time, where such express contrariety and in manner dispair appeareth to do good
 therein, and where should be none other but continual craft, colour, abuses,
 refuses and delays, but rather to proceed unto the same in place, and after
 such form as may be a appearance of some good and brief effect to ensue.
 Wherefore to shew you in Counsel, and to be reserved unto your selves, The
 King's Highness finding this ingratitude in the Pope's Holiness, is minded for
 the time to dissemble the Matter, and taking as much as may be had and attained
 there to the benefit of his Cause, to proceed in the Decision of the same here,
 by virtue <pb n="62" facs="tcp:104314:248"/> of the Commission already granted unto me and
 my Lord Legate <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for because that ye Mr. <hi>Stevins</hi> be largely
 ripened and acquainted in this Matter, and that both the King's Highness and I
 have right large experience of your entire zeal and mind to the studying and
 setting forth of such things concerning the Law, as may be to the furtherance
 hereof; considering also that for any great thing like to be done there herein,
 such Personages as be of good Authority, Wisdom, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, tho they be
 not learned in the Law, may with such Counsel as ye have retained there, right
 well serve to the accomplishment of such other things as shall occur, or be
 committed unto them on the King's behalf, tho so many Ambassadors do not there
 remain and continue: His Grace therefore willing and minding to revoke you all
 by little and little, except you Sir <hi>Gregory</hi> being his Ambassadour
 there continually residing, willeth, That after such things perfected and done,
 as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shall be mentioned, ye Mr. <hi>Stevins,</hi> and you Sir
 <hi>Francis Brian,</hi> shall take you leave of the Pope's Holiness, and with
 diligence return home. For if ne had been the absence of you Mr.
 <hi>Stevins,</hi> seeing that there is small appearance of any Fruit to be
 obtained there, the King's Highness would have entred into Process here before
 this <hi>Whitsuntide</hi>: But because his Grace would have you here present,
 as well for the forming of the said Process, and for such things as be trusted
 that ye shall obtain and bring with you, as also for the better knowledge to be
 had in sundry Matters, wherein you may be the better ripened and informed by
 means of your being in that Court: And otherwise his Highness will somewhat the
 longer defer the commencement of the said Process, and respite the same, only
 for your coming; which his Grace therefore desireth you so much the more to
 accelerate, as ye know how necessary it is, that all diligence and expedition
 be used in that Matter. And so ye all to handle and endeavour your selves
 there, for the time of your demor, as ye may do the most benefit and advantage
 that may be to the speedy furtherance of the said Cause.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as at the dispatch of your said last Letters, ye
 had not opened unto the Pope's Holiness, the last and uttermost Device here
 conceived, and to you written in my Letters sent by the said
 <hi>Alexander,</hi> but that ye intended, as soon as ye might have time and
 access, to set forth the same; wherein it is to be trusted, since that thing
 could by no colour or respect to the Emperor be reasonably denied, ye have
 before this time done some good, and brought unto perfection; I therefore
 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting you to such Instructions as ye received at that time, advertise you
 that the King's mind and pleasure is, ye do your best to attain the Ampliation
 of the said Commission, after such form as is to you, in the said last Letters
 and Instructions, prescribed; which if ye cannot in every thing bring to pass,
 at the least to obtain as much to the King's purpose, and the benefit of the
 Cause as ye can; wherein all good policy and dexterity is to be used, and the
 Pope's Holiness by all perswasions to be induced thereunto; shewing unto the
 same how ye have received Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the King's Highness and me, responsives
 to such as ye wrote of the Dates before rehearsed; whereby ye be advertised
 that the King's Highness, perceiving the Pope's strange demeanour in this his
 great and weighty Cause, with the little respect that his Holiness hath, either
 <pb n="63" facs="tcp:104314:248"/> to the importance thereof, or to do unto his Holiness at
 this his great necessity, gratuity and pleasure; not only cannot be a little
 sorry and heavy to see himself frustrate of the future hope and expectation
 that his Grace had, to have found the Pope's Holiness a most loving, fast, near
 and kind Father, and assured Friend, ready and glad to have done for his Grace,
 that which of his Power Ordinary or Absolute, he might have done in this thing,
 which so near toucheth the King's Conscience, Health, Succession, Realm, and
 Subjects; But also marvelleth highly, That his Holiness, both in Matters of
 Peace, Truce, in this the King's Cause, and in all other, hath more respect to
 please and content him of whom he hath received most displeasures, and who
 studieth nothing more than the detriment of the See, than his Holiness hath
 either to do that which a good common Father, for the well of the Church,
 Himself, and all Christendom, is bounden, and oweth to do, or also that which
 every thing well pondered, it were both of Congruence, Right, Truth, Equity,
 Wisdom, and conveniency for to do. Thinking ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that his Highness deserved
 to be far otherwise entreated, and that not at his most need in things nearest
 touching his Grace, and where the same had his chief and principal confidence,
 thus to have his just and reasonable Petitions rejected and totally to be
 converted, to the arbitre of his Enemy, which is not the way to win, acquire
 and conserve Friends to the Pope's Holiness and See Apostolick, nor that which
 a good and indifferent Vicar of Jesus Christ, and common Father unto all
 Princes, oweth and is bound to observe. Nevertheless ye shall say the King's
 Highness, who always hath shewed, and largely comprobate himself a most devout
 Son unto the See Apostolick, must and will take patience; and shall pray to God
 to put in the Pope's mind, a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and vertuous intent, so to proceed in
 his acts and doing, as he may be found a very Father, upright, indifferent,
 loving and kind; and not thus for partial respect, fear, or other inordinate
 Affection, or cause, to degenerate from his best Children, showing himself unto
 them, as a Step-Father, nor the King's Highness ye shall say can persuade unto
 himself, that the Pope's Holiness is of that nature and disposition, that he
 will so totally fail his Grace in this Matter of so high importance, but that
 by one good mean or other, his Holiness will perfectly comprobate the intire
 love that always the same hath shewed to bear towards his Highness, wherein ye
 shall desire him now to declare by his Acts the uttermost of his intent and
 disposition; so as ye Mr. <hi>Stevins</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who be
 revoked home, do not return with void hands, or bring with you things of such
 meagerness, or little substance, as shall be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: And thus by these,
 or like words, seconding to the same effect, which as the time shall require,
 and as he shall have cause, ye by your Wisdoms can qualifie and devise, It is
 not to be doubted, but that the Pope's Holiness perceiving how the Kings
 Highness taketh this Matter, and that two of you shall now return, will in
 expedition of the said Ampliation of the Commission, and other things
 requisite, strain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to do unto the King's Highness as much gratuity and
 pleasure as may be; for the better attaining whereof, ye shall also shew, how
 heavy and sorry I with my Lord Legate <hi>Campegius</hi> be, to see this manner
 of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and the large promises which he and I so often have made unto
 the King's Highness, of the Pope's fast and assured mind, to do all that 
 <pb n="64" facs="tcp:104314:249"/> his Holiness, <hi>etiam ex plenitudine potestatis,</hi>
 might do, thus to be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: most humbly beseeching his Holiness on my
 behalf, by his high Wisdom to consider, what a Prince this is; the infinite and
 excellent gratitudes which the same hath exhibited to the Pope's Person in
 parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and to the See Apostolick in the general; the magnitude and
 im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this Cause, with the Consequences that may follow, by the good
 or ill entreating of the King's Highness in the same; wherein ye shall say, I
 have so largely written, so plainly for my discharge declared the truth unto
 his Holiness, and so humbly, reverently, and devoutly, made intercession, that
 more can I not add or accumulate thereunto, but only pray unto God that the
 same may be perceived, understood, and taken, as the exigence of the Case, and
 the merits of this Noble Prince doth require; trusting always, and with fervent
 desire, from day to day, abiding to hear from his said Holiness some such thing
 as I shall now be able constantly to justifie and defend, the great things
 which I and my said Lord Legate have said and attested on his Holiness
 behalf.</p>
                  <p>This, with all other such matter as may serve to the purpose,
 ye shall extend as well as ye can, and by that means get and attain as much to
 your purpose for the corroboration and surety of all things to be done here as
 is possible, leaving to speak any more, or also to take or admit any rescripts
 for exhibition of the Brief, advocation of the Cause, or other of the former
 degrees, seeing that all which shall or can be done or attained there, shall
 hang meerly upon the Emperor's Will, Consent, and Arbitre: and therefore
 nothing is now or hereafter to be procured, that may tend to any Act to be
 done, in decision of the Cause or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there, or which may bring the
 adverse Party to any advantage to be taken by the favour or partiality, that
 the same may have in that Court; but to convert and employ all your suit, to
 that thing which may be to the most convalidation and surety of the Process,
 and things to be done here, as well by attaining, as ample, large, and
 sufficient words, clauses and sentences as ye can get, for ampliation of the
 new Commission.</p>
                  <p>As for the defeating of any thing that may be procured to the
 im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of the Process thereof, and the corroboration of the things to be
 passed, and done, by virtue of the same. And amongst other things, whereas ye
 with these last Letters, sent the Pope's Pollicitation, for the non-inhibition
 or avoking of the Cause, the ratifying and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Sentence by us
 his Legates herein to be given, and other things mentioned in the same, ye
 shall understand, that the said Pollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is so couched and qualified, as
 the Pope's Holiness whensoever he will may resile; like-as by certain Lines and
 Annotations, which in the Margin of a Copy of the said Pollicitation I send you
 herewith, ye shall perceive more at large: And therefore after your other
 suits, for the ampliation of the new Commission, if any such may be attained,
 brought unto as good a purpose as ye can, ye shall by some good way find the
 mean to attain a new Pollicitation, with such, or as many of the words and
 additions newly devised as ye can get; which ye may do under this form and
 colour, that is to say, to shew unto the Pope's Holiness, by way of sorrow and
 doleance, how your Courier, to whom ye committed the conveyance of the said
 Pollicitation, so chanced, in <pb n="65" facs="tcp:104314:249"/> wet and water in the
 carriage thereof, as the Pacquet wherein it was, with such Letters as were with
 the same, and amongst other the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts of Pollicitation, were totally wet,
 defaced, and not legible; so as the Pacquet and Rescript was and is detained by
 him to whom ye direct your Letters, and not delivered amongst the other unto
 the King's hands; and unless his Holiness, of his goodness unto you, will grant
 you a double of the said Pollicitation, ye see not but there shall be some
 no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table blame imputed unto you for not better ordering thereof, to the
 conservation of it from such chance. And thus coming to a new Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation,
 and saying, ye will devise it as near as ye can remember, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the
 former, ye by your Wisdoms, and namely ye Mr. <hi>Stevins,</hi> may find the
 means to get as many of the new and other pregnant, fat, and available words as
 is possible, the same signed and sealed as the other is, to be written in
 Parchment; the politick handling whereof, the King's Highness and I commit unto
 your good discretions; for therein, as ye Mr. <hi>Stevins</hi> know, resteth a
 great strength and corroboration of all that shall be done there, in decision
 of the King's said Cause; and as ye write, may be in manner as beneficial to
 the King's purpose, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission Decretal.</p>
                  <p>And to the intent ye may the better know how to proceed in
 this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, I advertise you that the King's Highness hath now received
 fresh Letters out of <hi>Spain,</hi> answering to those sent by <hi>Curson</hi>
 jointly with a Servant of the Queens, for exhibition of the Original Brief
 here, of whose expedition you Mr. <hi>Stevins</hi> were privy before your
 departure. The Letters were of sundry dates, the last whereof is the 21 of
 <hi>April,</hi> at which time the Emperor was at <hi>Caesar Augusta,</hi> upon
 his departure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Barselona.</hi> In effect, the Emperor minding by
 his departure thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and other his Acts, to make a great demonstration of
 his coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> who is to nothing, as the King's Ambassadours
 write, more unmeet and unfurnished to that voyage, not having any Gallies there
 but three, which lay on dry Land unrigged, as they have done a long time
 passed, none Assembly of the States of that Land, none order, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of
 Victual, towardness in conscription of Men of War, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of such
 thing, but that his going to <hi>Barselona,</hi> is chiefly under pretext to
 attain certain old Treasure there remaining, and to give the better reputation
 to his Affairs in <hi>Italy.</hi> As to the matter of Peace and Truce, he
 seemeth not so alien from it, but that he would, under colour thereof, be glad
 to separate and dis-join other from the sincerity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that is
 between them, working somewhat with the <hi>French</hi> King, which he himself
 confesseth to be but abuses. On the other side, he maketh overture of Peace or
 Truce to be had with the King's Highness apart; and in the mean time
 entertaineth the Pope's Holiness, as one whom won from the residue of the
 Confederates, he thinketh himself most assured of: Howbeit in all this his
 Business, ye may constantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that his Compasses cannot prevail in any
 thing that may be exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate to the separation of the King's Highness and the
 <hi>French</hi> King, who so entirely proceed together, that the Emperor coming
 or not coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> the said <hi>French</hi> King intendeth to
 prosecute him in the place where his Person shall be. To whom the King's
 Highness now sendeth the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> with the Treasurer of his
 honourable Houshold; <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104314:250"/> who, if the Pope will not really and
 actually intend to the maintaining of the Peace, coming to the convention of
 his Holiness, moved as the case shall require, shall be furnished of a
 substantial number of Men of War out of his Realm to the assistance of the said
 <hi>French</hi> King, if the Emperor happen to descend in <hi>Italy.</hi> So as
 his things there, be not like to be in such surety as might bring the Pope's
 Holiness to this extremity of fear and respect. And all the Premisses touching
 this knowledg had out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King's
 Interest with the King's Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as afore; It shall be well done ye
 declare to the Pope's Holiness, whereby peradventure the same shall be removed
 from some part of his said overmuch respect to that part.</p>
                  <p>As to sending of the Brief, the Emperor refusing to send it
 into <hi>England,</hi> sheweth some towardness of sending it to <hi>Rome,</hi>
 minding and intending to have the King's Matter decided there and not here;
 how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit all be but vain Collusions: For as ye shall perceive by such things as
 be extracted out of the Letters of the King's Orators Resident in
 <hi>Spain,</hi> a Copy whereof I send you herewith, the more the said Breve
 cometh into light and knowledg, the more falsities be deprehended therein; and
 amongst other, one there is specially to be noted, making, if it be true, a
 clearer and manifest proof of the same Falsity; which because if it were
 perceived by the adverse Party, or any of their Friends, Counsellors, or
 Adherents, it might soon by a semblable falsity be reformed, is above all other
 things to be kept secret, both from the Pope, and all other there, except to
 your selves: for in computation of the Year of our Lord is a diverse order
 observed in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in Bulls and Breves; That is to say, in
 the Bull beginning at the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Lord, in the Brief at the
 Nativity; So as the thing well searched, it is thought it shall be found, that
 the date presupposed to be of the Breve, which is 26 <hi>Decemb. Anno Dom.</hi>
 1503. <hi>Pontificatus Iulii anno primo,</hi> well conferred with the manner
 and usages of that Court: He that counterfeited the Brieve, not knowing such
 diversity between the date of the Bull and Breves, and thinking to make both
 Dates of one day, dated the Breve at a day before Pope <hi>Iulii</hi> was Pope;
 which ye shall more plainly perceive by the said Copy, and specially if under
 some good colour ye ripen your selves there, whether the year in the date of
 Breves change upon <hi>Christmass</hi> day, or upon <hi>New-years</hi> day,
 wherein the King's pleasure is, that ye ensearch and certifie here what ye
 shall know and perceive. And if ye shall by such inquiry find matter making to
 the purpose, as it is not doubted but ye shall do, then for the more sure
 justification and proof thereof before the Judges; It shall be expedient ye in
 writing make mention of such a doubt, finding the means that it may be answered
 and declared in the same Writing, by certain expert Persons of the Secretaries,
 and other Officers of that Court, with subscription of their Answer and Names;
 whereby it may appear here before us as Judges, as a thing true and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:
 Howbeit, great dexterity is to be used for the secrecy thereof; for if such
 Exceptions might come to the knowledg of the Adverse Party, they might, as the
 said Orators write, soon reform that default by detrahing one Letter, or Title,
 or forging a new Brief, alledging error in the Transumpts, which might be the
 total disappointment of <pb n="67" facs="tcp:104314:250"/> deprehension of the falsity in
 that chief and principal point. I pray you therefore to regard that Matter
 substantially, and to order it by your good Wisdoms accordingly.</p>

 <hi>Rome.</hi> An Original.</head>
                  <p>RIght well beloved Friends, I commend me unto you in my most
 hearty manner, by the hands of <hi>Alexander,</hi> Messenger; I have in good
 diligence received your Letters of the 4<hi>th</hi> of this Month; and
 semblably the King's Highness hath received your other Letters, sent by the
 same Messenger unto his Grace: By tenour whereof it well appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the
 King's Highness is now frustrate of the good hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation that his
 Grace and semblably I were in of the Pope's determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to have done for
 his Highness in this great and weighty Cause of Matrimony, as his Holiness by
 his Chamberlain promised; not only that which might be done of power ordinary,
 but also of absolute; and that ye be utterly in despair to consecute or attain
 any thing to the purpose there, to the benefit of the said Cause, with the
 strange demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that hath been used in calling you to make answer, why the
 sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications presented by the Emperor's Ambassador for advocation of the
 Cause should not proceed; and how discreetly and substantially ye have answered
 and ordered your selves therein: Affirming finally, that as to that Matter, ye
 think it shall not serve to any purpose, but only to stop your suit in the
 obtaining of a new Commission, and desiring to be ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the King's
 pleasure touching the Protestation mentioned in your Instructions, and how the
 same is meant and understood, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things comprised in your said
 Letters, right well and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially couched and handled; for the which the
 Kings Highness giveth you hearty thanks, and I also thank you in most hearty
 manner for my part.</p>
                  <p>Ascertaining you, that by <hi>Thadeus,</hi> Courier, upon
 receipt of your former Letters sent by him, who I trust be arrived with you
 long before this time; I wrote unto you the King's mind and pleasure, as well
 to forbear any further pursuits of the Degrees committed unto your Charge,
 except only the expedition of a new Commission and Pollicitation men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in
 the same. As also that you Mr. <hi>Stevins,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis
 Brian,</hi> should return home, like as my said Letters purported. And
 forasmuch as now it appeareth, that there is no hope for you to attain the said
 Commission and Pollicitation, the King's Highness supposing that ye the said
 Mr. <hi>Stevins</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis</hi> be on your way homeward; and
 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that it should be necessary for his Grace to have there a
 substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Counsellor of his, well learned in the Laws, as well to defend all
 such things as shall be procured or set forth by the <hi>Caesareans,</hi> to
 the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of the King's Cause, as to let and impeach any Advocations,
 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, or other thing that may be dammageable thereunto, hath
 di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched thither this Bearer and Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> who hath commandment 
 <pb n="72" facs="tcp:104314:253"/> to shew unto you, and every of you, wheresoever he shall
 meet with or find you, his whole Instructions, by tenour whereof ye shall be
 ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised of the King's further mind and pleasure in that behalf; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
 this shall be only to signifie unto you, how his Highness will that ye now
 forbear any further pursuit, either for Commission, Pollicitation or Rescript
 to be sent to the Emperor for exhibition of the Brief, either here or at
 <hi>Rome,</hi> but that following in every part the tenor of the said
 Instructions, ye Mr. <hi>Stevins</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Brian</hi> use all
 the diligence possible in your Voyage homeward, and the residue of you to
 intend to such things as be mentioned in the said Instructions; ascertaining
 you, that whereas ye were in doubt what is meant by the Protestation spoken of
 in my former Letters and your Instructions, it was none other thing than in the
 same Instructions was plainly specified and declared; That is to say, Failing
 of all your Requests and Pursuits touching the King's great Matter, to have
 shewed unto his Holiness the danger that might ensue, by losing the entire
 favour of this Prince, by mean of his so strange and unkind dealing with his
 Grace; howbeit, considering in what state the things now be, and how much the
 Pope's Holiness seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be inclined to the Emperors part. And yet as
 appeareth both by your Letters, and by such other knowledg as the King hath,
 his Holiness would gladly conserve the King's Love and Favour, and is loth to
 do any thing to the prejudice of his Cause: It is no time to come to any
 ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous or extream words with his Holiness, but in gentle and modest manner
 to shew himself in such words as be mentioned in my said last Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters sent by
 <hi>Thadeus</hi>; and so without irritation of him, but with conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of
 his favour to entertain his Holiness in the best manner that may be, without
 medling in any other Protestation, but only to look what may be done touching
 such Protestations apart, as is mentioned in the said Instructions given to Mr.
 <hi>Benet,</hi> which with these Letters shall be a sufficient information of
 you all what to do in the Causes to you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, not doubting but in all
 other particular suits of Bulls, and other things committed unto you, ye Mr.
 <hi>Stevins</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Brian,</hi> have or will do your best to
 bring the same with you; the expedition whereof, if they be not sped already,
 the King's Highness committeth to the Wisdoms of such of you as shall fortune
 to be in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> at the receipt hereof; wherein, and in all
 other things, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness trusteth, and I do the semblable, that ye will
 order your selves with all effectual diligence, as the special confidence that
 is put in you doth appertain.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as the greatest thing that is to be looked unto
 is the importune Suit of the <hi>Caesareans,</hi> not only to stop any further
 things to be granted to the King's Highness, but also to revoke the Commission
 given to the Lord Legate <hi>Campegius</hi> and to me, which should be a clear
 disappointment and frustration of the King's Cause; ye shall therefore look
 substantially by all politick means to withstand, that no such thing be
 granted; assuring the Pope and all the Cardinals, and such other as have
 respect to the well of the See Apostolick, that if he should do such an high
 injury to the King and his Realm, and an Act so contumelious to us his Legates,
 and so contrarious to his Faith and Promise, he should thereby not fail so
 highly to irritate the King and all the Nobles of this Realm, that undoubtedly
 they should decline from the obedience of <pb n="73" facs="tcp:104314:253"/> the See
 Apostolick, and consequently all other Realms should do the semblable,
 forasmuch as they should find in the <hi>Head</hi> of the same, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
 justness, uprightness, nor truth; and this shall be necessary, as the case
 shall require, well to be inculked and put in his head, to the intent his
 Holiness by the same may be preserved from granting, passing, or condescending
 to any such thing.</p>
                  <p>After these Letters perfected hither, and read unto the King's
 High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, albeit that mention is made in sundry places heretofore, that

                     </gap> to make any
 further means or pursuit for the New Commission and Pol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licitation, but clearly
 to use silence therein; yet nevertheless regarding and more profoundly
 considering the effect of your Letters last sent, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> doth plainly appear, that tho after
 the overture made to the Pope's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of the said New Commission, the
 Business chanced to be made by the Emperor's Ambassador, upon preferring a
 Supplication for advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Cause; which thing by your writing, Mr.
 <hi>Stevins,</hi> to <hi>Capisuke</hi> was well avoided; yet was there none
 express refusal made by the Pope's Holiness to condescend unto the said New
 Commission, but order given that you should consult and confer with the
 Cardinal <hi>Anconitane</hi> and <hi>Symonette</hi> upon the same; which
 Conference, by mean of the said Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, was deferred and disappointed,
 without any final conclusion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution taken thereupon. Wherefore inasmuch
 as yet there appeareth none utter despair of obtaining the said New Commission
 and Pollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with some more fat, pregnant, and effectual Clauses than
 the other hath; The King's pleasure is, That notwithstanding any words before
 mentioned, both ye the said Mr. <hi>Stevins,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis
 Brian,</hi> if ye be not departed from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> do for the
 time of your demur there, which the King's pleasure is, shall not be long, but
 only for taking of your leave; and also the rest of the King's said Orators,
 after your departure, shall, as ye shall see the case require, endeavour your
 selves as much as may be, to obtain the said New Commission and Pollicitation,
 foreseeing always that you handle the matter after such manner, as thereby the
 Pope be not the rather induced to hearken and incline to any persuites of the
 Imperials for advocation of the Cause, which were a total frustration of all
 the King's intent, but so to use your selves, as ye shall see to be to the
 benefit, and not to the hindrance thereof: Which done, the King's Grace doth
 refer the good handling of this thing to your wisdoms and discretions, neither
 to leave the persuit for the said Commission and Pollicitation, if it may
 without dammage be followed; nor to follow it, if thereby you shall see
 apparent danger of any such Advocation, or advantage to ensue to the purpose of
 the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists,</hi> like as his Highness doubteth not, knowing now the
 King's mind and pleasure, you will with wisdom and dexterity, order your selves
 herein accordingly.</p>
                  <p>And furthermore, you shall in any wise dissuade the Pope for
 sending either by his Nuntio, to be sent unto <hi>Spain,</hi> or otherwise, for
 the Original Brief: And if the Nuntio be already passed, having charge to speak
 for send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> then to find the means
 that a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be by the Pope's Holiness sent after him, not to make any
 mention <pb n="74" facs="tcp:104314:254"/> thereof: Which done to you, the King's said
 Ambassador shall have a good colour to induce the Pope's Holiness, saying, as
 of your self, That you have well considered your own pursuits for producing the
 Brief at <hi>Rome</hi>; and because the Emperor might per-case think that the
 Pope were about to arect unto him the falsity of the said Brief, therefore you
 can be contented that that matter be put off, and no mention to be made thereof
 by his Nuntio, or otherwise; whereunto it is not to be doubted but the Pope's
 Holiness will have special regard, and facilly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to your desires in
 that behalf.</p>
                  <p>Finally; It appeareth also by certain your Letters sent, as
 well to the King's Highness as to me, that the Pope's Holiness is much desirous
 to study and find a mean and way to satisfy the King's Highness in this behalf:
 Amongst which one clause in his Letters to me is this; <hi>Tametsi enim
 jurisperitorum consilium quaesiverimus, sed nihil reperimus, quod bonis or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>toribus simul &amp; justitiae ac honori
 nostro satisfaceret; sed tamen agimus omnia, &amp; tentamus omnes modos Regiae
 suae Serenitati, ac circumspectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni tuae satisfaciendi.</hi> (And it is added
 in the Margin, with <hi>Wolsey</hi>'s hand;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mi Petre, referas tuis literis pervelim quid tibi &amp;

 In nomine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris, &amp;c.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore since his Holiness so plainly declared, that he
 seeketh the ways and means to satisfie the King's Highness, it shall be in any
 wise expedient, that you the said Orators perceiving any towardness of
 Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, lay this to the Pope's Holiness, saying, That that is not the way
 to satisfy his Grace; and yet besides that, by your Wisdoms to find the means
 to understand and know of his Holiness what be the ways and means, which his
 Holiness hath studied or can study to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the King according to his
 writing in this behalf, whereof they shall say his Grace is glad, and is very
 desirous to know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the same; and as you shall perceive any
 towardness or untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Pope in that behalf, so to set forth your
 pursuits to the best purpose accordingly. And thus heartily fare you well. </p>

                  <p>Since your
 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from hence, we have received sundry your Letters to us directed,
 whereof the last beareth date at <hi>Rome,</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> day of the
 last month; and have also seen such other as from time to time ye have sent to
 the most Reverend Father in God, our most entirely well-beloved Counsellor the
 Lord Legate, Cardinal, Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> Primate of
 <hi>England,</hi> and our Chancellour: By continue whereof, we have been
 advertised of the Successes, as well of your Journey thitherwards, as of such
 things as ye to that time had done in our Causes to you commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for the
 which your diligent advertisement, and good acquittal, we give unto you condign
 thanks: ascertaining you, We do not a little marvel, that in your said last
 Letters you shew so much desperation of any great favour to be had at the
 Pope's hand in our said Causes; considering that neither ye then had spoken
 with his Holiness in the same, nor by <pb n="76" facs="tcp:104314:255"/> such Conferences as
 ye had had with Mr. <hi>Iacobo Salviati,</hi> or other on his behalf, we can
 perceive but all good favour and towardness; tho per-case the superiority of
 the Imperials, and the common fame, led you to think the contrary: Howbeit as
 you know no credence is to be given unto such common report, nor we trust the
 same shall prove more true, than hath done the Opinion that was of the Lord
 Legate <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegius</hi> now here Resident, whom we find and certainly know
 to be of a far other sort in his love and inclination towards us, than was
 spoken, not having such affection towards the Emperor, as in him was suspected.
 And to be plain with you, if ever he had been of other mind, we have said
 somewhat to him after such manner as might soon change that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. So that
 little Faith is to be given to the outward Sayings and Opinions of such People
 as measure every thing at their pleasure; which we doubt not but ye right
 wisely do consider, and that ye have before this time, by your diligent
 sollicitation made to speak with the Pope's Holiness for declaration of your
 Charge, proved the contrary. Whereof we shall be glad and joyous to hear;
 willing and desiring you therefore, according to the great and special
 confidence that we have in you, to pretermit no time in the diligent handling
 and execution of your said Charge, but by one good way or other to find the
 mean, if you have not already done it, to declare the same unto the Pope,
 wherein the good advice and address of the Bishop of <hi>Verone</hi> shall, We
 trust, do you great furtherance; and by whose means, if ye for the Pope's
 extreme debility or sickness might in no wise be often admitted unto his
 presence, ye may signify unto him at great length, our whole Mind, Desire, and
 Intent, after such form as your Instructions and Letters given and sent unto
 you in that behalf do purport: For sure ye may be, it shall highly confer unto
 the benefit of our Causes, that ye have there present one so fast and assured
 Friend unto us, as we trust the Bishop of <hi>Verone</hi> is, who shall be able
 right largely to countervail, and meet with the malicious practices of the
 Archbishop of <hi>Capua,</hi> who is thought to be one of the chief Authors and
 Contrivers of the Falsities, Crafts, and Abuses, set forth to the hindrance of
 our said Causes; which no Man shall more politickly and facilly deprehend, than
 the said Bishop of <hi>Verone</hi> may do: And therefore he is by you, with all
 good means and ways possible, to be entertained; as we doubt not but you will
 have special eye and regard to the making, winning, and conservation of as many
 Friends to our purpose as ye can possibly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; so handling your self, as
 now may appear your dexterity and perfect endeavour to conduce, with your
 diligent labour and policy, our Matters to the speedy, indelayed, and desired
 end and effect, which ye may be sure we shall not put in oblivion, but will
 have the same in remembrance accordingly. Marvelling nevertheless, that though
 ye Mr. <hi>Stevins</hi> could not bring hitherto our great Causes to
 perfection, ye had not in the mean season advertised us what is done touching
 such Bulls as were to be sped for our other particular Matters, whereof no
 mention is made in your said Letters; willing and desiring you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by
 your next Letters, to advertise us in what state and train the same be; knowing
 right well that ye being not only by the former Letters and Writings, but also
 by such as be sent unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at this time sufficiently and amply
 instructed of our Mind and Pleasure, will now <pb n="77" facs="tcp:104314:255"/> so acquit
 your self, as shall correspond to the perfect expectation, and firm opinion
 that we have of you, which we shall not fail to have in our tender
 consideration to your well, as is aforesaid. Ye shall also, in your Conferences
 with the said Bishop of <hi>Verone,</hi> understand and know of him, by what
 ways and means ye may best further his advancement to the Cardinality;
 exhorting him, for the manifold good effects that thereof may ensue, to conform
 himself to the acceptation thereof, if it may be obtained; for doubtless his
 Vertue, Wisdom, Experience, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and other great and commendable merits
 well considered, we think no Man more meet at this time to be preferred
 thereunto than him: And therefore our express Mind and Pleasure is, that ye do
 it by all the ways and means to you possible. And finally we will that ye show
 unto him how effectually we have written unto you in that behalf, to the
 intent, being advanced thereunto, he may give us the better thanks, and in
 every way bear to us the more perfect affection. And by your next Letters, We
 will that ye advertise us what Advocates ye have on our part, with their Names
 and Qualities; finding the means also, if it be possible, to retain some
 notable and excellent Divine, a Frier, or other that may, can, or will firmly
 stick to our Causes, in leaning to that, <hi>Quod Pontifex ex Iure Divino non
 potest dispensare, &amp;c.</hi> And of all the Successes to advertise us, as
 our special trust is in you. </p>

                  <p>TRusty and right well-beloved, we greet you well.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cotton</hi> libr. <hi>Vitel.</hi> B. 11.</note> By former
 Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Writings sent to you Sir <hi>Gregory</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peter,</hi>
 with other of your Collegues then being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by such
 conference as was had with you Mr. <hi>Benet</hi> before your departure, you
 were adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised in what state then stood our Cause and Matter of Matrimony,
 and how it was intended that the Process of the same should with diligence be
 commenced before the Pope's Legates here, being authorized for that purpose.
 Since that time, ensuing the deliberation taken in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, the said
 Legates, all due Ceremonies first observed, have directed <pb n="78" facs="tcp:104314:256"/>
 Citations both to us and to the Queen, for our and for her appearing before
 them the 18<hi>th</hi> of this month; which appearance was duly on either Party
 kept, performed, and all requisite Solemnities accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished: At which time the
 Queen trusting more in the power of the Imperialists, than in any justness of
 her Cause, and thinking of likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, by frustratory allegations and delays,
 to tract and put over the Matter to her advantage, did protest at the said day,
 putting in Libels, Recusatories of the Judges; and also made a provocation,
 alledging the Cause to be avoked by the Pope's Holiness, <hi>&amp; litis
 pendentiam coram eodem</hi>; desiring to be admitted for probation thereof, and
 to have a term competent for the same: Whereupon day was given by the Judges
 till the 21 of the same month, for declaration of their minds and intentions
 thereunto; The Queen in Person, and we by our Proctor enjoined to appear the
 same day, to hear what the said Judges should determine in and upon the same.
 At which time both we and the Queen appeared in Person; and notwithstanding
 that the said Judges amply and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared, as well the sincerity of
 their minds directly, justly to proceed without favour, dread, affection, or
 partiality; as also that no such Recusation, Appellation, or term for proving
 of <hi>Litis pendentiam,</hi> could or might be by them admitted: yet she
 nevertheless persisting in her former wilfulness, and in her Appeal, which also
 by the said Judges was likewise recused: And they minding to proceed further in
 the Cause, the Queen would no longer make her abode to hear what the said
 Judges would fully discern, but incontinently departed out of the Court;
 wherefore she was thrice preconnisate, and called eft-soons to return and
 appear; which she refusing to do, was denounced by the Judges
 <hi>Contumax,</hi> and a Citation decerned for her appearance on
 <hi>Friday</hi> next, to make answer to such Articles and Positions as should
 be objected unto her: So as now it is not to be doubted, but that she will use
 all the ways and means to her possible, to impetrate and attain such things, as
 well by her own pursute, as by her Friends, as may be to the impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
 the rightful Process of this Cause, either by Advocation, Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or
 otherwise: Wherefore seeing now in what state this our Matter standeth and
 dependeth, necessary and requisite for the great Consequences hanging upon the
 same, not only for the exoneration of our Conscience, but also for the surety
 of our Succession, and the well of this our Realm and People, to be with all
 celerity perfected and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. It was thought convenient to advertise you of
 the Premisses, to the intent ye being well and sufficiently instructed in all
 things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same, shall by your wisdoms and diligences have special
 regard that nothing pass or be granted there by the Pope's Holiness, which may
 either give delay or disappointment to the direct and speedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to be
 used in this Cause, neither by Advocation of the Cause, Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or
 otherwise; but that if any such thing shall, by the <hi>Caesareans</hi>; or by
 her Agents, or other, be attempted, or desired, the like Men of Wisdom, good
 Zeal, Learning, and Experience, diligently procure the stopping thereof, as
 well upon such Reasons and Considerations as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have been signified unto
 you, as by inferring the high and extream dishonour, and intolerable prejudice
 that the Pope's Holiness thereof should do to his said Legates; and also the
 contrariety both of his Bull and Commission, and also of his Promise and
 Pollicitation passed upon the <pb n="79" facs="tcp:104314:256"/> same; beside the notable
 and excellent displeasure thereby to be done by his Holiness to us, and our
 Realm, clear contrary to our merits and deserts; extending also the other
 dangers mentioned in the said former Writings, apparent to ensue thereby to his
 Holiness, and the See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick, with the manifold, and in manner, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inite inconveniences like to follow of
 the same to all Christendom, and all other such reasons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductions and
 perswasions ye can make and devise for that purpose: putting him also in
 remembrance of the great Commodity coming unto his Holiness herein, by reason
 that this Cause being here decided, the Pope not only is delivered from the
 pains that he should in this time of Disease and Sickness, to the extream peril
 of his Life sustain with the same, seeing that it is of such moment and
 importance, as suffereth no tract or delay; but also his Holiness shall by such
 decision here eschew and avoid all displeasure that he should not fail to have,
 if it were or should be passed elsewhere: which matter is no little wisdom well
 to foresee and consider, and not only to forbear to do or pass any thing
 derogatory or prejudicial to his said Commission, but also by all means
 possible to corroborate and fortify the same, and all such Acts judicial as
 shall pass by his said Legates by virtue thereof. Like-as we doubt not but that
 the Pope's Holiness, of his Uprightness, Vertue, and perfect Wisdom will do;
 and rather like a most loving Father and Friend, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and favour our good,
 just and reasonable Causes and Desires, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereunto all the furtherance
 he may do, than to do or consent to be done any thing hurtful, prejudicial,
 dammageable, or displeasant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, or this our said Cause. And finally; If
 need shall be, we will ye also infer, as the case shall require, how
 inconvenient it were this our Matter should be decided in the Court of
 <hi>Rome</hi>; which now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth totally in the Emperor's Arbitre, having
 such puissance near thereunto, that, as hath been written by the Pope's own
 Letters, their State and Life there is all in the Emperor's hands, whose Armies
 may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish or relieve them at their pleasure. And semblably ye shall not
 for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the prerogative of our Crown and Jurisdiction Royal, by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
 Laws of our Realm, which admitteth nothing to be done by the Pope to the
 prejudice thereof, and also what danger they should incur that would presume to
 bring or present any such thing unto the same, as in our last Letters sent by
 <hi>Alexander</hi> was touched at good length. Wherein since ye be already so
 well and amply instructed, knowing also how much the Matter imports and
 toucheth us, and what profit and agreeable service ye may do unto us herein,
 with the high thanks that ye may deserve for the same; We shall not be more
 prolix, but refer the substantial, perfect, and assured handling hereof to your
 circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spections, fidelities, and diligences, not doubting but that ye will now
 above all other things, look vigilantly hereunto, and so acquit your selves in
 the same, as it may well appear that your Acts shall be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent to our
 firm trust and expectation, and no less tender this thing than ye know it to be
 imprinted in the bottom of our Heart, nor then as ye know both the importance
 and high moment, and also the very necessity of the Matter doth require. In
 which doing, beside the laud and praise that ye shall consecute thereby of all
 good Men, we shall so have your acquittals in our remembrance, as ye shall have
 cause <pb n="80" facs="tcp:104314:257"/> to think your travels, pains, and studies herein,

11.</note>PLease it your Grace to understand, that the 6<hi>th</hi> day of this
 month the Pope's Holiness send for us: Albeit we had made great sute for
 audience before to his Holiness, soon after that we had understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his
 Holiness was recovered of this his last Sickness, into the which he fell the
 second day, after I had my first audience of his Holiness, which was the 21 day
 of the last month: And after our long communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and reasoning in the
 King's Highness Cause, which, at length, we have written to your Grace in our
 common Letter, for a confirmation of many inconveniences and dangers which we
 perswaded to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to follow both to himself and to the See
 Apostolick, in case his Holiness should avoke the cause; I thought much
 convenient at that same time to deliver the King's familiar, and likewise your
 Grace's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so to shew your Grace's Credence to his Holiness. After
 the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Letters delivered, and by his Holiness read, his Holiness shewed
 me, that he perceived by your Grace's Letters, that I had certain Credence to
 shew unto him of great moment and importance, concerning him and the See
 Apostolick. I shewed to his Holiness your Grace's Faith and observance, his
 Holiness doth best know; most humbly besought his Holiness to believe these
 undoubtedly to follow, That if his Holiness should, at the labours of the
 <hi>Caesareans,</hi> avoke the Cause, he should not alonely offend the King's
 Highness, which hitherto hath been a stay, a help, and a defence of the See
 Apostolick; but also by reason of this injury, without remedy, shall alienate
 his Majesty and Realms, with others, from the devotion and obedience of the See
 Apostolick. This I shewed his Holiness, that your Grace doth evidently perceive
 to follow, in case his Holiness should incline to the <hi>Caesareans</hi>
 desire on this behalf: Yea further, I said, that your Grace most clearly
 perceiveth also by that Act, the Church of <hi>England</hi> utterly to be
 destroyed, and likewise your Person; and that these your Grace, with weeping
 tears, most lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably committed unto me to shew to his Holiness. Furthermore
 I shewed to his Holiness, that your Grace, howsoever you should proceed in this
 Cause, did intend to proceed so sincerely, indifferently, and justly, that you
 would rather suffer to be jointed, Joint by Joint, than either for affection or
 fear, do any act either against your Conscience or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. Furthermore I
 said, that seeing his Holiness may be so well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that your Grace will do
 nothing but according to Justice in this Cause, he may the more boldly deny
 Avocations to the <hi>Caesareans,</hi> seeing that the Queen and the Emperor
 can desire but Justice, which they may have at your Grace's hand, and my Lord
 <hi>Campegius,</hi> as well there <pb n="81" facs="tcp:104314:257"/> as here; and by this
 means his Holiness should deliver himself from great pains and unquietness of
 mind, which he should sustain in case the Cause should be known here, where he
 should have the King's Highness on one part, and the Emperor on the other side,
 daily calling upon his Holiness. To this his Holiness most heavily, and with
 tears, answered and said, That now he saw the destruction of Christendom, and
 lamented that his fortune was such to live to this day, and not to be able to
 remedy it, (saying these words) For God is my Judg, I would do as gladly for
 the King, as I would for my self; and to that I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg my self most bounden,
 but in this case I cannot satisfy his desire, but that I should do manifestly
 against Justice to the charge of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to my rebuke, and to the
 dishonour of the See Apostolick; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that his Counsel shews him, that
 seeing the <hi>Caesareans</hi> have a Mandate or Proxie of the Queen, to ask
 the Avocations in her Name, he cannot of Justice deny it, and the whole
 Signature be in that same opinion; so that though he would most gladly do that
 thing that might be to the King's pleasure, yet he cannot do it, seeing that
 Signature would be against him whensoever the Supplication should be up there:
 And so being late, we took our leave of his Holiness, and departed, seeing that
 we could obtain nothing of the Pope for stopping the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, we consulted
 and devised for the deferring of it, till such time as your Grace might make an
 end in the Cause there. And so concluded upon a new Device, which at length we
 have written in our common Letter, wherein I promise your Grace, Mr.
 <hi>Gregory</hi> has used great diligence, and taken great labours at this
 time, we can do no more for our lives: And if your Grace saw the importune
 labour of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of the Emperor's and <hi>Ferdinandoes,</hi> you
 would marvel, I promise your Grace they never cease; wherefore in staying
 hitherto, as we have done, it is marvel, as God knoweth, whom I pray to
 preserve your Grace in health and prosperity <hi>ad multos annos.</hi> I
 beseech your Grace most humbly to commend me to the King's Highness; and
 like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I beseech your Grace to pardon my ill writing. </p>

 quidem billae tenor sequiturin haec verba.</hi> The King's humble, faithful,
 and loving Subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this
 present Parliament assembled, considering and calling to their remembrances,
 the inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Costs, Charges, and Expences, which the King's Highness
 necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath been compelled to support and sustain, since his assumption
 to his Crown, Estate, and Dignity Royal; as well first for the extinction of a
 right dangerous and damnable Schism sprung and risen in the Church; which by
 the providence of the Almighty God, and the high prudence, and provision, and
 assistance of the King's Highness, was, to the great honour, laud, and glory of
 his Majesty, repressed; the Enemies then being of the Church reformed,
 returned, and restored to the unity of the same, and peace over all componed
 and concluded, as also for the modifying of the insatiable and inordinate
 ambition of those which do aspire unto the Monarchy of Christendom, did put
 universal trouble, divisions in the same, intending, if they might, not only to
 have subdued this Realm, but also all the rest unto their Power and 
 <pb n="83" facs="tcp:104314:258"/> Subjection: For the resistance whereof, the King's
 Highness was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, after the Universal Peace, by the great study, labour,
 and travel of his Grace conduced, and the same by some of the Contrahents
 new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violate and infringed; in shewing the form of the Treaties thereupon
 made again, and take Armour. And over and besides the notable and excessive
 treasure and substance which his Highness in his first Wars had emploied for
 the defence of the Church, the Faith Catholick, and this his Realm, and of the
 People and Subjects of the same, was eft-soons brought of necessity to new,
 excellent, and marvellous Charges, both for the supportation of sundry Armies
 by Sea and by Land; and also for divers and manifold Contributions outward, to
 serve, keep, and contain his own Subjects at home in rest and repose; which
 hath been so politickly handled and conduced, that when the most part of all
 reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Christians have been infested with cruel Wars, Discords, Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
 and Dissensions, the great Heads and Princes of the World brought unto
 Captivity; Cities, Towns, and Places, by force and sedition, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, spoiled,
 burnt, and sacked; Men, Women, and Children found in the same slain and
 destroyed; Virgins, Wives, Widows, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Women, ravished and
 defloured; Holy Churches and Temples polluted, and turned unto prophane use;
 the Reliques of the Holy Saints irreverently treated; Hunger, Dearth, and
 Famine, by mean thereof in the said outward Regions, insuing and gentily over
 all, was depopulation, destruction and confusion; the King's said Subjects in
 all this time, were by the high providence and politick means of his Grace
 nevertheless preserved, defended, and maintained, from all these inconveniences
 and dangers; and such provisions taken, by one way or other, so as reasonable
 commodity was always given unto them to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Traffiques of
 Merchandise, and other their Crafts, Mysteries, and Occupations for their
 living; which could not possibly have been brought about, unless then the
 King's Highness, with continual studies, travels, and pains, and with his
 infinite Charges and Expences, had converted the peril and danger of the
 Enterprises and Exploits, set forth for the reduction of the Enemies unto
 Peace, from his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects unto Strangers: Whereof finally such Fruit and
 Effect is ensued, as by the King's policy, puissance, and means, general and
 universal Peace is established amongst all Christian Princes; and this Realm
 now, thanked be God, constitute in free, better, and more assured and
 pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Amity with all outward Parties, than hath been at any time whereof
 is memory or remembrance. Considering furthermore, That his Highness, in and
 about the Premisses, hath been fain to employ, not only such sums of Mony as
 hath risen and grown by any manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution made unto his Grace by his
 said loving Subjects, but also over and above the same, sundry other notable
 and excellent Sums of his own Treasure, and yearly Revenues, which else his
 Grace might have kept and reserved to his own use; amongst which manifold great
 Sums so employed, his Highness also, as is notoriously known, and as doth
 evidently appear by the accompts of the same, hath to that use and none other,
 converted all such Mony, as by any his Subjects and People, Spiritual and
 Temporal, hath been advanced unto his Grace by way of Prest and Loan, either
 particularly, or by any Taxation made of the same, being a thing so well
 collocate and bestowed, seeing the said high <pb n="84" facs="tcp:104314:259"/> and great
 Fruits and Effects thereof ensued, to the honour, surety, well, perfect
 commodity, and perpetual tranquillity of this said Realm, as nothing could
 better nor more to the comfort of his said Subjects be desired, studied, or
 imagined; Of one mind, consent and assent, and by Authority of this present
 Parliament, do for themselves, and all the whole Body of the Realm whom they do
 represent, freely, liberally, and absolutely, give and grant unto the King's
 Highness, by Authority of this present Parliament, all and every Sum and Sums
 of Mony, which to them, and every of them, is, ought, or might be due, by
 reason of any Mony, or any other thing, to his Grace at any time heretofore
 ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, or payed, by way of Prest or Loan, either upon any Letter or Letters
 under the King's Privy Seal, general or particular, Letter, Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, Promise,
 Bond, or Obligation of payment, or by any Taxation, or other Assessing, by
 virtue of any Commission or Commissions, or by any other mean or means
 whatsoever it be heretofore passed for that purpose, and utterly, frankly,
 liberally, and most willingly and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volently, for them, their Heirs,
 Executors, and Successors, do remit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease, and quit claim, unto his
 Highness, his Heirs and Successors for ever, all and every the same Sums of
 Mony, and every parcel thereof, and all and singular Suits, Petitions, and
 Demands, which they, or any of them, their Heirs, Successors, or Executors, or
 the Heirs, Executors, or Successors of any of them, have, had, or may have for
 the same, or any parcel thereof; most humbly and lovingly, beseeching his
 High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for the more clear discharge for the same, that it may be ordained
 and enacted by the King, our said Sovereign Lord, the Lords Spiritual and
 Temporal, and the Commons of this present Parliament assembled, and by
 authority of the same, that all Promises, Bonds, Writings, Obligatory Letters,
 under the King's Privy Seal, Signet, Sign Manual, or Great Seal passed, and
 other Bonds or Promises, whatsoever they be, had, or made, to any Person or
 Persons, Spiritual or Temporal, Shire, City, Burrough, Waxentale, Tranship,
 Hamlet, Village, Monastry, Church, Cathedral, or Collegiat, or to any Guild,
 Fraternity, or Body Corporate, Fellowship, or Company, or other whatsoever,
 having ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to take any Bond, especially and generally, jointly or
 severally, touching or concerning the same Prest or Loan, or every of them, or
 the repaiment of any Sum or Sums of Mony for the same, be from henceforth void
 and of none effect. <hi>Cui quidem billae probe &amp; ad ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num intellectae

                           <hi>Cotton</hi> Libr. <hi>Vitell. B.</hi> 13.</note> That arriving
here at <hi>Cambridg</hi> upon <hi>Saturday</hi> last past at noon, that same
night, and <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> in the Morning, we devised with the
Vice-chancellour, and such other as favoureth your Grace's Cause, how and in
what sort to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass and attain your Grace's Purpose and Intent; wherein we
assure your Grace, we found much towardness, good will, and diligence, in the
Vice-Chancellour and Dr. <hi>Edmunds,</hi> being as studious to serve your
Grace as we could wish or desire: Nevertheless there was not so much care,
labour, study, and diligence employed on our Party, by them, our self, and
other, for attaining your Grace's Purpose, but there was as much done by others
for the lett and empeachment of the same; and as we assembled they assembled,
as we made Friends they made Friends, to lett that nothing should pass as in
the Universities Name; wherein the first day they were Superiors, for they had
put in the ears of them, by whose Voices such things do pass, <hi>multas
fabulas,</hi> too tedious to write unto your Grace. Upon <hi>Sunday</hi> at
afternoon were assembled, after the manner of the University, all the Doctors,
Batchellors of Divinity, and Masters of Art, being in number almost two
hundred: In that Congregation we delivered your Grace's Letters, which were
read openly by the Vice-Chancellor. And for answer to be made unto them, first
the Vice-Chancellor calling apart the Doctors, asked their Advice and Opinion;
whereunto they answered severally, as their Affections led them, <hi>&amp; res
erat in multa confusione. Tandem</hi> they were content Answer should be made
to the Questions by indifferent Men: But then they came to Exceptions against
the Abbot of St. <hi>Benets,</hi> who seemed to come for that purpose; and
likewise against Dr. <hi>Reppes,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Crome</hi>; and also
generally against all such as had allowed Dr. <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Book, inasmuch
as they had already declared their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. We said thereunto, That by that
reason they might except against all; for it was lightly, that in a Question so
notable as this is, every Man Learned hath said to his Friend as he thinketh in
it for the time; but we ought not to judg of any Man, that he setteth more to
defend that which he hath once said, than Truth afterward known. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; The
Vice-Chancellor, because the day was much spent in those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercations,
commanding every Man to resort to his Seat apart, as the manner is in those
Assemblies, willed every Man's mind to be known secretly, whether they would be
content with such an Order as he had conceived for answer to be made by the
University to your Grace's Letters; whereunto that night they would in no wise
agree. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as it was then dark night, the Vice-Chancellor continued
the Congregation till the next day at one of the Clock; at which time the
Vice-Chancellor proponed a Grace after the form herein inclosed; and 
<pb facs="tcp:104314:260"/> 
                        <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:104314:261"/> it was first
denied: When it was asked again, it was even on both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be denied or
granted; and at the last, by labour of Friends to cause some to depart the
House which were against it, it was obtained in such form as the Schedule
herein enclosed purporteth; wherein be two Points which we would have left out;
but considering by putting in of them, we allured many, and that indeed they
shall not hurt the Determination for your Grace's part, we were finally content
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. The one Point is that where it was first, that <hi>quicquid major
pars</hi> of them that be named <hi>decreverit,</hi> should be taken for the
Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the University. Now it referred <hi>ad du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s partes,</hi> wherein we suppose shall
be no difficulty. The other Point is, That your Grace's Question shall be
openly disputed, which we think to be very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and it is agreed
amongst us, That in that Disputation, shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the Abbot of St.
<hi>Benets,</hi> Dr. <hi>Reppes,</hi> and I Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> to all such as
will object any thing or reason against the conclusion to be sustained for your
Grace's part. And because Mr. Doctor <hi>Clyss</hi> hath said, That he hath
somewhat to say concerning the Canon-Law; I your Secretary shall be adjoined
unto them for answer to be made therein. In the Schedule which we send unto
your Grace herewith, containing the names of those who shall determine your
Grace's Question, all marked with the Letter A. be already of your Grace's
Opinion; by which we trust, and with other good means, to induce and obtain a
great part of the rest. Thus we beseech Almighty God to preserve your most
Noble and Royal Estate. </p>

13.</note>PLease it your Highness to be advertised, That as this day I obtained
 the Common Seal of the University of <hi>Padua,</hi> in substantial and good
 form; for all the Doctors were assembled upon <hi>Sunday,</hi> and the Case was
 amongst them solemnly and earnestly disputed all <hi>Monday, Tuesday,
 Wednesday,</hi> and <hi>Thursday,</hi> and this present <hi>Friday</hi> in the
 morning again; and thereupon they concluded with your Highness, and desired a
 No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to set his Sign and Hand unto an Instrument, by <hi>Leonicus</hi> and
 <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netus</hi> devised, in corroboration of your Cause, and thereby to
 testify that this Instrument was their Deed, Device, Act, and Conclusion; and
 for the more credence to be given to the said Instrument, they caused the
 Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the <hi>Potestate</hi> here to set his Hand and Seal for the
 approbation of the Authority of the Notary: A Copy of all the which things I
 send unto your Highness by this Bearer, in most humble wise beseeching the same
 to be advertised, that the General of the Black-Friers hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a
 Commandment, That no Black-Frier dispute the Pope's Power: Notwithstanding
 Prior <hi>Thomas Omnibonus</hi> procureth daily new Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and will do
 till the Brief of contrary Commandment shall come unto his hands.</p>
                  <p>My fidelity bindeth me to advertise your Highness, that all
 <hi>Lutherans</hi> be utterly against your Highness in this Cause, and have
 letted as much with their wretched Power, Malice, without Reason or Authority,
 as they could and might, as well here, as in <hi>Padua</hi> and
 <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where be no small Companies of them. I doubt not but all
 Christian Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if they be well handled, will earnestly conclude with
 your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And to obtain their assent, as well through <hi>Italy, France,
 Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne, Austrich, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> I think it marvellous
 expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for the preferment of this your most honourable and high Cause; As
 from the Seigniory and Dominion of <hi>Venice</hi> towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and
 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Rome,</hi> I think there can be no more done than is done already,
 albeit, gracious Lord, if that I had in time been sufficiently furnished with
 Mony. Albeit I have beside this Seal procured unto your Highness an hundred and
 ten Subscriptions, yet it had been nothing in comparison of that that I might
 easily and would have done; and at this hour I assure your Highness, that I
 have neither Provision nor Mony, and have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed an hundred Crowns, the
 which also are spent about the getting of this Seal; of the which my need, and
 divers impediments in your Highness's Cause here, I have advertised your
 Highness by many and sundry Letters, and with the same sent divers Books and
 Writings, part to <hi>Hierom Molins</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> and factor to
 <hi>Mappheus Bernardus,</hi> by the hands of your Subject <hi>Edmund
 Herwell,</hi> part directed to Mr. <hi>Tuke,</hi> whereof I am nothing
 ascertained whether they be exhibited unto your Highness or not, to no little
 discomfort unto me; notwithstanding I have reserved a Copy of all things,
 Letters, and other, and herein enclosed a Bill, specifying by whom and to whom
 I directed my said <pb n="89" facs="tcp:104314:262"/> Letters, in most humble wise,
 beseeching your most Royal Clemency, to ponder my true, sure, and good
 endeavours, and not to suffer me to be destitute of Mony, to my undoing, and
 utter loss of your most high Causes here; for of my self I have nothing whereby
 to help my self. And thus the most Blessed Trinity keep and preserve your
 High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in his most Royal Estate. </p>

 Divortii Serenissimi &amp; Illustrissimi Regis Angliae, Franciae, &amp;c.
 proposita &amp; diligenter agitata a Reverendo D. D. Edwardo Hereford.
 Episcopo, D. Nicolao Archdiacono &amp; D. D. Barnes, intelleximus Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissimum
 Regem maximis &amp; gravissimis Causis adductum, superatum &amp; conclusum
 esse, ut in hoc negotio Matrimonii sui faceret quod fecit: Nam hoc manifestum
 est &amp; negare nemo potest, quod Lex Levit. tradita Lev. 18. v. 20. prohibet
 ducere fratris Uxorem, &amp;c. sed Divina, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis, &amp; moralis Lex est
 intelligenda tam de vivi quam de mortui fratris Uxore, &amp; quod contra hanc
 legem nulla contraria lex fieri aut constitui possit, sicut &amp; tota Ecclesia
 semper hanc Legem retinuit, &amp; judicavit hujusmodi nuptias incestas esse,
 sicut testantur Synodorum Decreta &amp; Sanctissimorum Patrum Clarissimae
 Sententiae, &amp; has nuptias prohibent &amp; vocant incestas etiam jura
 Civilia. Proinde &amp; nos sentimus, &amp; hanc Legem de non ducenda Uxore
 fratris in omnibus Ecclesiis servandam esse veluti divinam, naturalem, &amp;
 moralem Legem; Nec in nostris Ecclesiis vellemus dispensare aut permittere,
 praesertim ante factum, ut ejusmodi nuptiae contraherentur, &amp; hanc
 Doctrinam possumus &amp; volumus Deo volente facile defendere. Caeterum quantum
 ad Divortium pertinet, nondum sumus plene persuasi ut sententiam nostram ferre
 possimus, An post Contractum Matrimonium in hoc casu Serenissimi Regis debuerit
 fieri Divortium. Rogamus igitur Seren. Regem ut aequo animo ferat, differri
 nostram Sententiam in hac re donec erimus certiores.</p>

 Jesu Christi quaerere debeas? Si id existimas vehementer erras, &amp; a Christi

 amare ac pascere oves? Itane debitum quo Ecclesiae Romanae astringeris, recte
 exsolvis? En ante oculos tuos ab ovili errantes in praecipitium labuntur oves,

 neglectu perierit ovium (pereunt autem multae) de tuis manibus sanguis earum
 exigetur? Quid per os Ezechielis Dominus comminatur, memorare &amp; extimesce.
 Ipse, inquit, Speculatorem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini posuit te Deus, si videris gladium
 venientem, &amp; non insonueris buccina, &amp; aliquis perierit, sanguinem ejus
 de manibus tuis requiram; haec dicit Dominus. Qualis autem &amp; qualis
 iniquitatis &amp; abominationis gladius in Angliae Regnum, atque oves tuas

                  <head>Act. 33. Anno Regni vicesimo tertio. <hi>XLI.</hi> An Act
 concerning Restraint of payment of <hi>Annates</hi> to the See of
 <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>FOrasmuch as it is well perceived, by long approved
 experience, that great and inestimable Sums of Mony have been daily conveyed
 out of this Realm, to the impoverishment of the same; and specially such sums
 of Mony as the Pope's Holiness, his Predecessors, and the Court of
 <hi>Rome,</hi> by long time have heretofore taken of all and singular those
 Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Persons which have been named, elected, presented, or postula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to
 be Arch-Bishops or Bishops within this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> under the
 Title of <hi>Annates,</hi> otherwise called First-Fruits. Which
 <hi>Annates,</hi> or First-Fruits, have been taken of every Arch-Bishoprick, or
 Bishoprick, within this Realm, by restraint of the Pope's Bulls, for
 Confirmations, Elections, Admissions, Postulations, Provisions, Collations,
 Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Institutions, Installations, Investitures, Orders, Holy
 Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Palles, or other things requisite and necessary to the attaining
 of those their Promotions; and have been compelled to pay, before they could
 attain the same, great Sums of Mony, before they might receive any part of the
 Fruits of the said Arch-Bishoprick, or Bishoprick, whereunto they were named,
 elected, presented, or postulated; by occasion whereof, not only the Treasure
 of this Realm hath been greatly conveighed out of the same, but also it hath
 hapned many times, by occasion of death, unto such Arch-Bishops, and Bishops,
 so newly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, within two or three years after his or their Consecration,
 that his or their Friends, by whom he or they have been holpen to advance and
 make paiment of the said <hi>Annates,</hi> or First-Fruits, have been thereby
 utterly undone and impoverished. And for because the said <hi>Annates</hi> have
 risen, grown, and encreased, by an uncharitable Custom, grounded upon no just
 or good title, and the paiments thereof obtained by restraint of Bulls, until
 the same <hi>Annates,</hi> or First-Fruits, have been paied, or Surety made for
 the same; which declareth the said Paiments to be exacted, and taken by
 constraint, against all equity and justice. The Noble Men therefore of the
 Realm, and the Wise, Sage, Politick Commons of the same, assembled in this
 present Parliament, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ceaseth not to
 tax, take, and exact the said great Sums of Mony, under the Title of
 <hi>Annates,</hi> or First-Fruits, as is aforesaid, to the great damage of the
 said Prelates, and this Realm; <pb n="103" facs="tcp:104314:269"/> Which <hi>Annates,</hi>
 or First-Fruits, were first suffered to be taken within the same Realm, for the
 only defence of Christian People against the Infidels, and now they be claimed
 and demanded as mere duty, only for lucre, against all right and conscience.
 Insomuch that it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, that there hath passed out of this Realm
 unto the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> sithen the second year of the Reign of the
 most Noble Prince, of famous memory, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, unto this
 present time, under the name of <hi>Annates,</hi> or First-Fruits, payed for
 the expedition of Bulls of Arch-Bishopricks and Bishopricks, the sum of eight
 hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Ducats, amounting in <hi>Sterling</hi> Mony, at the least, to
 eightscore thousand pounds, besides other great and intolerable Sums which have
 yearly been conveighed to the said Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by many other ways
 and means, to the great impoverishment of this Realm. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, that our
 said Sovereign the King, and all his natural Subjects, as well Spiritual as
 Temporal, been as obedient, devout, Catholick and humble Children of God, and
 Holy Church, as any People be within any Realm christned; yet the said
 exactions of <hi>Annates,</hi> or First-Fruits, be so intolerable and
 importable to this Realm, that it is considered and declared, by the whole Body
 of this Realm now represented, by all the Estates of the same assembled in this
 present Parliament, that the King's Highness before Almighty God, is bound, as
 by the duty of a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Prince, for the conservation and preservation
 of the good Estate and Common-Wealth of this his Realm, to do all that in him
 is to obviate, repress, and redress the said abusions and exactions of
 <hi>Annates,</hi> or First-Fruits. And because that divers Prelates of this
 Realm being now in extream Age, and in other debilities of their Bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
 so that of likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, bodily death in short time shall or may succeed unto
 them; by reason whereof great sums of Mony shall shortly after their deaths, be
 conveighed unto the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the unreasonable and
 unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Causes abovesaid, to the universal damage, prejudice, and
 im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverishment of this Realm, if speedy remedy be not in due time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided:
 It is therefore ordained, established, and enacted, by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this
 present Parliament, That the unlawful paiment of <hi>Annates,</hi> or
 First-Fruits, and all manner Contributions for the same, for any
 Arch-Bishoprick, or Bishoprick, or for any Bulls hereafter to be obtained from
 the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to or for the foresaid purpose and intent, shall
 from henceforth utterly cease, and no such hereafter to be payed for any
 Arch-Bishoprick, or Bishoprick, within this Realm, other or otherwise than
 hereafter in this present Act is declared; And that no manner, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor
 Persons hereafter to be named, elected, presented, or postula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any
 Arch-Bishoprick, or Bishoprick, within this Realm, shall pay the said
 <hi>Annates,</hi> or First-Fruits, for the said Arch-Bishoprick, or Bishoprick,
 nor any other manner of Sum or Sums of Mony, Pensions or <hi>Annates</hi> for
 the same, or for any other like exaction, or cause, upon pain to forfeit to our
 said Sovereign Lord the King, his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, all manner his Goods
 and Chattels for ever, and all the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lands and Possessions of the same
 Arch-Bishoprick, or Bishoprick, during the time that he or they which shall
 offend, contrary to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Act, shall have, possess, or enjoy, the
 Arch-Bishoprick, or Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick; wherefore he shall so offend contrary to the
 form aforesaid. And furthermore it is enacted, by Authority of this present
 Parliament, That <pb n="104" facs="tcp:104314:270"/> if any Person hereafter named and
 presented to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> by the King, or any of his Heirs or
 Successors, to be Bishop of any See or Diocess within this Realm hereafter,
 shall be letted, deferred, or delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> from any
 such Bishoprick, whereunto he shall be so represented, by means of restraint of
 Bulls Apostolick, and other things requisite to the same; or shall be denied,
 at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon convenient suit made, any manner Bulls
 requisite for any of the Causes aforesaid, any such Person or Persons so
 presented, may be, and shall be, consecrated here in <hi>England</hi> by the
 Arch-Bishop, in whose Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the said Bishoprick shall be, so alway that the
 same Person shall be named and presented by the King for the time being to the
 same Arch-Bishoprick: And if any Persons being named and presented, as
 afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, to any Arch-Bishoprick of this Realm, making convenient suit, as is
 aforesaid, shall happen to be letted, deferred, delayed, or otherwise disturbed
 from the same Arch-Bishoprick, for lack of Pall, Bulls, or other to him
 requisite, to be obtained in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, that
 then every such Person named and presented to be Arch-Bishop, may be, and shall
 be, consecrated and invested, after presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, as is aforesaid, by any
 other two Bishops within this Realm, whom the King's Highness, or any of his
 Heirs or Successors, Kings of <hi>England</hi> for the time being, will assign
 and appoint for the same, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and in like manner as divers other
 Arch-Bishops &amp; Bishops have been heretofore, in ancient time by sundry the
 King's most noble Progenitors, made, consecrated, and invested within this
 Realm: And that every Arch-Bishop and Bishop hereafter, being named and
 presented by the King's Highness, his Heirs or Successors, Kings of
 <hi>England,</hi> and being consecrated and invested, as is aforesaid, shall be
 installed accordingly, and shall be accepted, taken, reputed, used, and obeyed,
 as an Arch-Bishop or Bishop of the Dignity, See, or Place whereunto he so shall
 be named, presented, and consecrated requireth; and as other like Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of
 that Province, See, or Diocess, have been used, accepted, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and obeyed,
 which have had, and obtained compleatly, their Bulls, and other things
 requisite in that behalf from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And also shall fully
 and entirely have and enjoy all the Spiritualities and Temporalities of the
 said Arch-Bishoprick, or Bishoprick, in as large, ample, and beneficial manner,
 as any of his or their Predecessors had, or enjoyed in the said
 Arch-Bishoprick, or Bishoprick, satisfying and yielding unto the King our
 Sovereign Lord, and to his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, Kings of <hi>England,</hi>
 all such Duties, Rights, and Interests, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time had been
 accustomed to be paid for any such Arch-Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, or Bishoprick, according
 to the Ancient Laws and Customs of this Realm, and the King's Prerogative
 Royal. And to the intent our said Holy Father the Pope, and the Court of
 <hi>Rome,</hi> shall not think that the pains and labours taken, and hereafter
 to be taken, about the writing, sealing, obtaining, and other businesses
 sustained, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be sustained, by the Offices of the said Court of
 <hi>Rome,</hi> for and about the Expedition of any Bulls hereafter to be
 obtained or had for any such Arch-Bishoprick, or Bishoprick, shall be
 irremunerated, or shall not be sufficiently and condignly recompensed in that
 behalf. And for their more ready expedition to be had therein, it is therefore
 enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That every Spiritual Person of this Realm, 
 <pb n="105" facs="tcp:104314:270"/> hereafter to be named, presented, or postulated, to any
 Arch-Bishoprick or Bishoprick of this Realm, shall and may lawfully pay for the
 writing and obtaining of his or their said Bulls, at the Court of
 <hi>Rome,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sealing the same with Lead, to be had without payment of
 any <hi>Annates,</hi> or First-Fruits, or other charge or exaction by him or
 them to be made, yielden, or paied for the same, five pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi>
 for and after the rate of the clear and whole yearly value of every hundreth
 pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> above all charges of any such Arch-Bishoprick, or
 Bishoprick, or other mony, to the value of the said five pounds, for the clear
 yearly value of every hundreth pounds of every such Arch-Bishoprick, or
 Bishoprick, and not above, nor in any other wise, any things in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
 Act before written notwithstanding. And forasmuch as the King's Highness, and
 this his High Court of Parliament, neither have, nor do intend to use in this,
 or any other like cause, any manner of extremity or violence, before gentle
 courtesie or friendship, ways and means first approved and attempted, and
 without a very great urgent cause and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion given to the contrary, but
 principally coveting to disburden this Realm of the said great exactions, and
 intolerable charges of <hi>Annates,</hi> and First-Fruits, have therefore
 thought convenient to commit the final order and determination of the
 Premisses, in all things, unto the King's Highness. So that if it may seem to
 his high wisdom, and most prudent discretion, meet to move the Pope's Holiness,
 and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> amicably, charitably, and reasonably, to
 compound, other to extinct and make frustrate the payments of the said
 <hi>Annates,</hi> or First-Fruits; or else by some friendly, loving, and
 tolerable composition to moderate the same in such wise as may be by this Realm
 easily born and sustained; That then those ways and compositions once taken,
 concluded, and agreed, between the Pope's Holiness and the King's Highness,
 shall stand in strength, force, and effect of Law, inviolably to be observed.
 And it is also further ordained, and enacted by the Authority of this present
 Parliament, That the King's Highness at any time, or times, on this side the
 Feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> which shall be in the Year of our Lord God, a
 thousand five hundred and three and thirty, or at any time on this side the
 beginning of the next Parliament, by his Letters Pattents under his Great Seal,
 to be made, and to be entred of Record in the Roll of this present Parliament,
 may and shall have full power and liberty to declare, by the said Letters
 Patents, whether that the Premisses, or any part, clause, or matter thereof,
 shall be observed, obeyed, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and take place and effect, as an Act and
 Statute of this present Parliament, or not. So that if his Highness, by his
 said Letters Patents, before the expiration of the times above-limited, thereby
 do declare his pleasure to be, That the Premisses, or any part, clause, or
 matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, shall not be put in execution, observed, continued, nor
 obeyed, in that case all the said Premisses, or such part, clause, or matter,
 as the King's Highness so shall refuse, disaffirm, or not ratifie, shall stand
 and be from henceforth utterly void and of none effect. And in case that the
 King's Highness, before the expiration of the times afore-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, do declare
 by his said Letters Patents, his pleasure and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be, that the
 said Premisses, or every clause, sentence, and part thereof, that is to say,
 the whole, or such part thereof as the King's Highness so shall affirm, accept,
 and ratifie, shall in all points stand, <pb n="106" facs="tcp:104314:271"/> remain, abide,
 and be put in due and effectual execution, according to the purport, tenour,
 effect, and true meaning of the same; and to stand and be from henceforth
 forever after, as firm, stedfast, and avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Law, as the same had
 been fully and perfectly established, enacted, and confirmed, to be in every
 part thereof, immediately, wholly, and entirely executed, in like manner, form,
 and effect, as other Acts and Laws; The which being fully and determinately
 made, ordained, and enacted in this present Parliament: And if that upon the
 foresaid reasonable, amicable and charitable ways and means, by the King's
 Highness to be experimented, moved, or compounded, or otherwise approved, it
 shall and may appear, or be seen unto his Grace, that this Realm shall be
 continually burdened and charged with this, and such other intolerable
 Exactions and Demands, as heretofore it hath been. And that thereupon, for
 continuance of the same, our said Holy Father the Pope, or any of his
 Successors, or the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> will, or do, or cause to be done at
 any time hereafter, so as is above rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, unjustly, uncharitably, and
 unreasonably vex, inquiet, molest, trouble, or grieve our said Sovereign Lord,
 his Heirs or Successors, Kings of <hi>England,</hi> or any of his or their
 Spiritual or Lay-Subjects, or this his Realm, by Excommunication,
 Excomengement, Interdiction; or by any other Process, Censures, Compulsories,
 Ways, or Means; Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the King's
 Highness, his Heirs and Successors, Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and all his
 Spiritual and Lay-Subjects of the same, without any scruples of Conscience,
 shall and may lawfully, to the honour of Almighty God, the encrease and
 continuance of vertue and good example within this Realm, the said Censures,
 Excommunications, Interdictions, Compulsories, or any of them notwithstanding,
 minister, or cause to be ministred, throughout this said Realm, and all other
 the Dominions or Territories belonging or appertaining thereunto; All and all
 manner Sacraments, Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Ceremonies, or other Divine Services of the
 Holy Church, or any other thing or things necessary for the health of the Soul
 of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as they heretofore at any time or times have been vertuously used
 or accustomed to do within the same; and that no manner such Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
 Excommunications, Interdictions, or any other Process or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsories, shall
 be by any of the Prelates, or other Spiritual Fathers of this Region, nor by
 any of their Ministers or Substitutes, be at any time or times hereafter
 published, executed, nor divulged, nor suffered to be published, executed, or
 divulged in any manner of ways. <hi>Cui quidem Billae praedictae &amp; ad

 devout kissing of your blessed Feet. Albeit that we have hitherto differred to
 make answer to those Letters dated at <hi>Bonony,</hi> the 7<hi>th</hi> day of
 <hi>October</hi>; which Letters of late were delivered unto us by <hi>Paul</hi>
 of <hi>Cassali:</hi> Yet when they appear to be written for this Cause, that we
 deeply considering the Contents of the same, should provide for the
 tranquillity of our own Conscience, and should purge such Scruples and Doubts
 conceived of our Cause of Matrimony; We could neither neglect those Letters
 sent for such a purpose, nor after that we had diligently examined and
 perpended the effects of the same, which we did very diligently, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
 conferring, and revolving every thing in them contained, with deep study of
 mind, pretermit ne leave to answer unto them. For sith that your Holiness
 seemeth to go about that thing chiefly, which is to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish those Doubts, and
 to take away inquietations which daily do prick our Conscience; insomuch as it
 doth appear at the first sight to be done of Zeal, Love, and Piety, we
 therefore do thank you of your good will. Howbeit sith it is not performed in
 Deed, that ye pretend, we have thought it expedient to require your Holiness to
 provide us other Remedies; wherefore forasmuch as your Holiness would vouchsafe
 to write unto us concerning this Matter, we heartily thank you, greatly
 lamenting also both the chance of your Holiness, and also ours, unto whom both
 twain it hath chanced in so high a matter of so great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be frustrated
 and deceived; that is to say, That your Holiness not being instructed, nor
 having knowledg of the Matter, of your self, should be compelled to hang upon
 the Judgment of others, and so put forth and make answers, gathered of other
 Men, being variable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant among themselves. And that we being so long
 sick, and exagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with this same Sore, should so long time in vain look for
 Remedy; which when we have augmented our aegritude and distress, by delay and
 protracting of time, ye do so cruciate the Patient and Afflicted, as who seeth
 it should much avail to protract the Cause, and thorough vain hope of the end
 of our desire to lead us whither ye will. But to speak plainly to your
 Holiness; Forasmuch as we have suffered many Injuries, which with great
 difficulty we do sustain and digest; albeit <pb n="108" facs="tcp:104314:272"/> that among
 all things passed by your Holiness, some cannot be laid, alledged, nor objected
 against your Holiness, yet in many of them some default appeareth to be in you,
 which I would to God we could so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish, as it might appear no default; but
 it cannot be hid, which is so manifest, and tho we could say nothing, the thing
 it self speaketh. But as to that that is affirmed in your Letters, both of
 God's Law, and Man's, otherwise than is necessary and truth, let that be
 ascribed to the temerity and ignorance of your Counsellors, and your Holiness
 to be without all default, save only for that ye do not admit more discreet and
 learned Men to be your Counsellors, and stop the mouths of them which liberally
 would speak the Truth. This truly is your default, and verily a great fault,
 worthy to be alienate and abhorred of Christ's Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, in that ye have dealt so
 variably, yea rather so inconstantly and deceivably. Be ye not angry with my
 words, and let it be lawful for me to speak the Truth without displeasure; if
 your Holiness shall be displeased with that we do rehearse, impute no default
 in us, but in your own Deeds; which Deeds have so molested and troubled us
 wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we speak now unwillingly, and as enforced thereunto. Never
 was there any Prince so handled by a Pope, as your Holiness hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated us.
 First; When our Cause was proponed to your Holiness, when it was explicated and
 declared afore the same; when certain Doubts in it were resolved by your
 Counsellors, and all things discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it was required that answer might be
 made thereunto by the order of the Law. There was offered a Commission, with a
 promise also that the same Commission should not be revoked; and whatsoever
 Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence should be given, should streight without delay be confirmed. The
 Judges were sent unto us, the Promise was delivered to us, subscribed with your
 Holiness's hand; which avouched to confirm the Sentence, and not to revoke the
 Commission, nor to grant any thing else that might lett the same; and finally
 to bring us in a greater hope, a certain Commission Decretal, defining the
 Cause, was delivered to the Judges hands. If your Holiness did grant us all
 these things justly, ye did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly revoke them; and if by good and truth the
 same was granted, they were not made frustrate nor annihilate without fraud; so
 as if there were no deceit nor fraud in the Revocation, then how wrongfully and
 subtilly have been done those things that have been done! Whether will your
 Holiness say, That ye might do those things that ye have done, or that ye might
 not do them? If ye will say that ye might do them, where then is the Faith
 which becometh a Friend, yea, and much more a Pope to have, those things not
 being performed, which lawfully were promised? And if ye will say that ye might
 not do them, have we not then very just cause to mistrust those Medicines and
 Remedies with which in your Letters ye go about to heal our Conscience,
 espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that we may perceive and see those Remedies to be prepared for
 us, not to relieve the Sickness and Disease of our Mind, but for other means,
 pleasures, and worldly respects? And as it should seem profitable, that we
 should ever continue in hope or despair, so always the Remedy is attempted; so
 that we being always a-healing, and never healed, should be sick still. And
 this truly was the chief cause why we did consult and take the advice of every
 Learned Man, being free, without all affection, that the Truth (which now with
 our labour and <pb n="109" facs="tcp:104314:272"/> study we seem partly to have attained) by
 their judgments more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly divulged, we might more at large perceive;
 whose Judgments and Opinions it is easy to see how much they differ from that,
 that those few Men of yours do shew unto you, and by those your Letters is
 signified. Those few Men of yours do affirm the prohibition of our Marriage to
 be inducted only by the Law positive, as your Holiness hath also written in
 your Letters; but all others say the prohibition to be inducted, both by the
 Law of God and Nature: Those Men of yours do suggest, that it may be dispensed
 for avoiding of slanders; The others utterly do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that by no means it
 is lawful to dispence with that, that God and Nature hath forbidden. We do
 separate from our Cause the Authority of the See Apostolick, which we do
 perceive to be destitute of that Learning whereby it should be directed; and
 because your Holiness doth ever profess your ignorance, and is wont to speak of
 other Mens mouths, we do confer the sayings of those, with the sayings of them
 that be of the contrary Opinion; for to confer the Reasons it were too long.
 But now the Universities of <hi>Cambridg, Oxford,</hi> in our Realms;
 <hi>Paris, Orleance, Biturisen, Andegavon,</hi> in <hi>France</hi>; and
 <hi>Bonony</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> by one consent; and also divers other of the
 most famous and Learned Men, being freed from all affection, and only moved in
 respect of veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, partly in <hi>Italy,</hi> and partly in <hi>France,</hi> do
 affirm the Marriage of the Brother with the Brother's Wife, to be contrary both
 to the Law of God and Nature; and also do pronounce that no Dispensation can be
 lawful or available to any Christian Man in that behalf: But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think the
 contrary, by whose Counsels your Holiness hath done that, that sithence ye have
 confessed ye could not do, in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to us as we have above rehearsed, and
 giving that Commission to the Cardinal <hi>Campege</hi> to be shewed unto us;
 and after, if it so should seem profitable to burn it, as afterwards it was
 done indeed as we have perceived. Furthermore, those which so do moderate the
 Power of your Holiness, that they do affirm, That the same cannot take away the
 Appellation which is used by Man's Law, and yet is available to Divine Matters
 every-where without distinction. No Princes heretofore have more highly
 esteemed, nor honoured the See Apostolick than we have; wherefore we be the
 more sorry to be provoked to this contention, which to our usage and nature is
 most alienate and abhorred. Those things so cruel we write very heavily, and
 more glad would have been, to have been silent if we might, and would have left
 your Authority untouched with a good will, and constrained to seek the verity,
 we fell, against our Will, into this contention; but the sincerity of the Truth
 prohibited us to keep silence, and what should we do in so great and many
 perplexities? For truly if we should obey the Letters of your Holiness, in that
 they do affirm that we know to be otherwise, we should offend God and our
 Conscience, and we should be a great slander to them that do the contrary,
 which be a great number, as we have before rehearsed: Also, if we should
 dissent from those things which your Holiness doth pronounce, we would account
 it not lawful, if there were not a Cause to defend the Fact, as we now do,
 being compelled by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, lest we should seem to contemn the Authority of
 the See Apostolick. Therefore your Holiness ought to take it in good part, tho
 we do somewhat at large and more liberally speak in this Cause, 
 <pb n="110" facs="tcp:104314:273"/> which doth so oppress us, specially forasmuch as we
 pretend none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocity, nor use no rethorick in the exaggerating and encreasing
 the indignity of the Matter; but if I speak of any thing that toucheth the
 quick, it proceedeth of the meer verity, which we cannot nor ought not to hide
 in this Cause, for it toucheth not Worldly Things but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, not frail but
 eternal; in which things no feigned, false, nor pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Reasons, but only the
 Truth, shall obtain and take place: and God is the Truth to whom we are bound
 to obey rather than to Men; and nevertheless we cannot but obey unto Men also,
 as we were wont to do, unless there be an express cause why we should not;
 which by those our Letters we now do to your Holiness: and we do it with
 charity, not intending to spread it abroad, nor yet further to impugn your
 Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, unless ye do compel us; albeit also, that that we do, doth not
 impugne your Authority, but confirmeth the same, which we revocate to its first
 foundations; and better it is in the middle way to return, than always to run
 forth head-long and do ill. Wherefore if your Holiness do regard or esteem the
 tranquillity of our Mind, let the same be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished with verity, which hath
 been brought to light by the consent of so many Learned Men; So shall your
 Holiness reduce and bring us to a certainty and quietness, and shall deliver us
 from all anxiety, and shall provide both for us and our Realm, and finally
 shall do your Office and Duty. The residue of our Affairs we have committed to
 our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours to be propounded unto you, to whom we beseech your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
 to give credence, &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Cotton</hi> Libr. <hi>Vitel.</hi> B. 13.</note> That sithen we
 <hi>William Benet, Edward Karne,</hi> and <hi>Edmond Bonner,</hi> sent our
 Letters of the 7<hi>th</hi> of this present to your Highness; There hath been
 two Disputations publick, the one the 13<hi>th</hi> of this, the other the
 20<hi>th</hi> day of the same, according to the order given and assigned, which
 was three Conclusions to be disputed every Consistory; and what was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as
 well by your Highness's Counsel, for the justification of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
 purposed the said 13<hi>th,</hi> as also for the impugnation thereof by the
 Party adverse, with Answers made thereunto by your Highness's said Counsel as
 fully as were any wise deduced, your said Highness shall perceive by the Books
 sent herewithal containing the same; and also the Justifications, Objections,
 and Answers, made in the 6<hi>th</hi> of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, according as I
 <hi>Edward Karne</hi> in my said Letters promised. The Copies of all the which
 Justifications, Objections, and Answers, after that they were fully noted and
 deduced in writing, and maturely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by your Highness's Learned
 Counsel, I <hi>Edward Karne</hi> did bring to the Pope's Holiness, and to the
 Cardinals, for their better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and likewise did of the first, alwise
 afore the Consistory, according to the order assigned at the beginning; looking
 in likewise that the Queen's Counsel should do this same, but as yet they have
 done nothing therein, tho your Ambassadors and I have called upon the Pope many
 times for the same. And as concerning such things as were spoken and done for
 either part in the Disputation of the 20<hi>th</hi> day, it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
 for us, by reason of the shortness of time, to reduce all in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and
 to send the same to your Highness at this time; nevertheless with all speed it
 shall be made ready, and sent to your Highness by the next Courier. After the
 Disputation done, the said 13<hi>th</hi> day of this present, the Advocate of
 the Party adverse did alledg, That we did seek this Disputation but only to
 defer the Process; protesting therefore, That the Queen's Counsel would dispute
 no more; and desiring therefore the Pope's Holiness, and the whole Consistory,
 to make Process in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cause. Whereunto I <hi>Edward Karne</hi>
 said, That the Pope's Holiness, with the whole Senate, had granted the
 Disputations upon the Matters, and given an order that the Conclusions
 published should be disputed according to the same. Whereupon I desired that
 forasmuch as there <pb n="112" facs="tcp:104314:274"/> remained sixteen Conclusions not
 disputed, (which to propose and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify, with your Highness's Counsel, I would
 be ready at all times) that if the Party adverse knowing the Conclusions to be
 Canonical, would not confess them, and thereby avoid Disputations, that then
 the said Party should dispute them, and upon the refusal of both the same, the
 Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters excusatories to be admitted byhis Holiness, especially because the
 said Party adverse hath nothing material that could be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to lett the
 same. The Pope's Holiness answered, That he would deliberate upon the demand of
 both Parties. The 16<hi>th</hi> of this present, the Datary on the Pope's
 behalf sent unto me <hi>Edward Karne</hi> an Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for disputation of the
 Consistory to be kept the 20 of this present, and that I should send the
 Conclusions not disputed, that they might be in the said Consistory disputed;
 adding withal, that the said Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story should be, <hi>ultimus &amp;
 peremptorius terminus quoad alias Disputatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> Of the which Intimation
 your Highness shall receive a Copy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Upon this, with the advice of
 your Ambassadors and Counsel here, I repaired unto the said Datary, and brought
 unto him three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions to be disputed, with a Protestation, <hi>De non
 recedendo ab ordine hactenus observato,</hi> according to the Proem of the said
 Conclusions, the Copy whereof your Highness shall receive herewith. Afterwards,
 with the same Conclusions and Protestation, I went to Cardinal <hi>de
 Monte,</hi> who said, at the beginning, That all the Consistory crieth out upon
 the Disputations, and that we had been heard sufficiently, and that it was
 enough that we should have the fourth Disputation; adding withal, That it was a
 thing never seen before after such sort; and that it stood not with the honour
 of the See to have such Disputations in the Consistory, to the great
 disquieting of the Pope and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, especially considering the manner
 that is used, and that all the Conclusions be touched which should content us.
 To this I answered, and desired his most Reverend Lordship to call to his
 remembrance, what he had promised to your Highness's Ambassadors and me, in the
 <hi>Castel-Angel</hi> upon <hi>Shrove-Sunday,</hi> the Pope being present, and
 allowing the same, contented that all the Conclusions should be disputed
 <hi>singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter</hi>; and that I should at my pleasure, from time to time,
 chuse the Conclusions to be disputed. And how also afterward, <hi>viz.</hi> 17
 <hi>Febr.</hi> the Pope's Holiness, Cardinal <hi>Ancona,</hi> and his Lordship,
 not going from that promise, gave direction for three Conclusions to be
 disputed every Consistory; the choice whereof to be at my liberty (according to
 the Copy of the said Order which I sent to your Highness with my Letters, of
 the date of the 22 of the last): And furthermore, that what time the order to
 dispute three Conclusions in a Consistory was sent unto me, and I required to
 send the Conclusions first to be disputed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the said order; I did,
 to avoid all manner of doubts, protest afore I would accept it, and in the
 deliverance of the said Conclusions, that I would not otherwise accept it, but
 that all the Conclusions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order promised in
 <hi>Castel-Angel,</hi> should be disputed and examined <hi>singulariter,</hi>
 and that standing, and not otherwise, I delivered my said Conclusions according
 to the Order of the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February</hi>; which Order the Pope's
 Holiness hitherto had approved and observed, and from that I neither could nor
 would go from: And where he said that we had been heard sufficiently; I said,
 that Audience and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <pb n="113" facs="tcp:104314:274"/> of less than the one half
 of a Matter could not be sufficient; and if they intended to see the truth of
 the whole, every point must be discussed. And as for the crying out of the
 Cardinals, I said, They had no cause so to do, for it was more for the honour
 of the See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick, to see such a Cause as this is, well and surely tried,
 so that the Truth may appear, and the Matters be well known, than to proceed
 <hi>praecipitanter,</hi> as they did at the beginning of this Matter, afore
 they well knew what the Matter was. And as touching the disquieting the Pope's
 Holiness, and the said Cardinals, I said, your Highness for their pains was
 much beholden unto them; nevertheless, I said, that they might on the other
 side ponder such pains as your Highness hath taken for them, in part declared
 by me; which was much more than for them to sit in their Chairs two or three
 hours in a week, to hear the justice of your defence in this cause. And as
 touching the manner used in the said Disputation, I said, his Lordship knew
 well that it was by the Party ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, which all manner of ways goeth about to
 fatigate and make wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Consistory of the Disputations, specially in
 chiding, scolding, and alledging Laws and Decisions that never were, nor spoken
 of by any Doctor, and vainly continuing the time, to the intent that the Pope's
 Holiness, and the Cardinals, dissolving the Consistory, and not giving
 audience, the said Party, without Law, Reason, or any good ground, might attain
 their desire, and keep under the Truth, that it should not appear; and if any
 thing was sharply spoken of our Party, I said it was done only for our defence,
 and to shew the errors and falsity of the Queen's Advocates in their
 Allegations, wherein, I said, they should not be spared. And forasmuch as on
 the behalf of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness there was nothing spoken but that which was
 grounded upon Law, and declared in what place, so that it cannot be denied; I
 desired his Lordship that he would continue his goodness in this Matter, as
 your Highness's especial trust was he would do; and that we might always, as we
 were accustomed, have recourse unto the same in all our Business for his good
 help and counsel. His Lordship not yet satisfied, said, That as concerning the
 Order, the Pope's Holiness might interpretate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what he meaned by
 it; and as touching the Conclusions, they were superfluous, impertinent, and
 calumnious, only proposed to defer the Matter. I answered, and said, That to
 interpretate the said Order, where it is clear out of doubt, the Pope's
 Holiness considering the promise made on <hi>Shrove-Sunday,</hi> with my
 Protestation foresaid, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the said Order to that time, in
 divers Consistories observed, could not by right interpretate the said Order,
 admitting disputation upon all the Conclusions; and of this I said, That if
 such alterations were made, without any cause given of your Highness's Party,
 there was little certainty to be reckoned upon amongst them. And as touching
 the superfluity and impertinency of the said Conclusions, I said, That that was
 the saying of the Party adverse, that did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the same Conclusions.
 And further, that such Conclusions as were clamorously, by the Advocates of the
 Party adverse, alledged to be superfluous, his Lordship in the Disputation and
 trial thereof in the Consistory, did manifestly perceive that it was not so.
 And where it was alledged the said Conclusions to be calumnious, and laid in to
 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Process. I answered, That we might well alledg again the 
 <pb n="114" facs="tcp:104314:275"/> Counsel of the Party adverse, the thing against us
 alledged, and say truly, that we were calumniously dealed withal, seeing the
 matters were so just and clear, and yet not admitted. Then his Lordship went
 fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and said, that <hi>Impedimentum allegatum erat perpetuum,</hi>
 because your Highness, <hi>ex causa reipublicae,</hi> could not come out your
 Realm, and <hi>quia dignitas vestra est perpetua</hi>; and also <hi>quod Causa
 requirit celeritatem.</hi> To this, I said, that his Lordship mistook the
 Matter, for we said not in the Matters that your Highness could not go out of
 your Realm to no place, but we said, that the same could not go, <hi>ad loca
 tam remota,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> is; so that it was not <hi>perpetuum
 impedimentum.</hi> And to the other I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a Text, and the common
 opinion of Doctors in a Cause of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, being <hi>inter Regem &amp;
 Reginam,</hi> which took away the thing that he had said. Then his Lordship
 said, That it was enough that the place were sure to the Procurator by the
 Chapter, <hi>Cum olim de testibus.</hi> I said, That that Chapter did not prove
 that Allegation, and that they mistook the Text that so did understand it, for
 the Alternative that is in that Text is not referred <hi>ad locum tutum,</hi>
 but <hi>ad ordinem Citationis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choandae in persona principali, aut ejus
 procuratore</hi>; and so <hi>Petrus de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorano</hi> understandeth that Text;
 and otherwise understanding the same it should be against the Chapter, <hi>Ex
 parte de appellatione,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion there. Then he said that
 <hi>Aretine</hi> saith, <hi>Quod sufficit quum locus sit tutus
 procuratori.</hi> I said, that under his favour, <hi>Aretine</hi> saith the
 contrary, for he saith, <hi>Quod partibus debet locus tutus assignari si
 poterit, &amp; si non poterit partibus, detur procuratoribus.</hi> Then his
 Lordship said to me, That I knew well he began to set forward these
 Disputations, and that he would do the best he could for the furtherance
 thereof.</p>
                  <p>The 19<hi>th</hi> of this present I went with your Highness's
 Ambassadors to the Pope, and delivered his Holiness in writing those things
 that were done in the Disputation of the 13<hi>th</hi> of this: And then your
 Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors were in hand with the Pope to alter the Intimation, and to put out
 the term <hi>peremptory,</hi> and other that were exclusory of further
 Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be had upon the same Conclusions. The Pope's Holiness said,
 That Disputations was no act Judicial requiring to be in the Consistory; and
 therefore he said, he would call certain Congregations of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, on
 <hi>Friday</hi> and <hi>Monday</hi> following, to hear the Disputations. Then I
 <hi>William Benet</hi> said, That that could not stand very well with the
 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Intimation, which was peremptory for any further Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
 after the 20<hi>th</hi> of this present; and therefore I spake that the same
 term <hi>peremptory</hi> might be put out of the Intimation, alledging withal,
 that upon the said <hi>Friday</hi> or <hi>Monday</hi> it was no time to hear
 the Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being so nigh after; and that his Holiness hitherto hath
 observed the Consistory for the Disputations, which Consistory cannot be unto
 after <hi>Easter,</hi> if the manner of the Court be observed. Then the Pope
 said, he might call a Consistory when he would, as he hath done in making of
 Cardinals, an Act much more solemn than a Disputation. To that, I said, his
 Holiness might so do if he would; howbeit, it should be <hi>praeter solitum
 morem:</hi> and therefore desired his Holiness to consider therein the order
 before assigned, and that this term <hi>peremptory</hi> would not stand with
 the order. His Holiness then willed we should inform the Cardinals,
 <hi>Anchona,</hi> and <hi>de Monte,</hi> and so we did; <hi>Anchona</hi> shewed
 himself somewhat reasonable, and was contented the term <hi>peremptory</hi> 
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:104314:275"/> should be put out. <hi>De Monte</hi> said that the Pope
 would promise to hear the Conclusions disputed in Congregations, calling
 thereto certain Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, so that the term <hi>peremptory</hi> should not be
 prejudicial. Then I <hi>Edward Karne</hi> desired him, that if the said term
 should not be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, that it might be stricken out, for I told him
 plainly that I would not stand to words, the writing shewing the contrary;
 adding withal, that I would not dispute in this term, <hi>tanquam
 peremptorio,</hi> but would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly shew and protest, That I, with other
 your Highness's Counsel, were ready to defend the Conclusions published,
 according to the order given, and hitherto observed; alledging also, that the
 Conclusions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justified, the Matters ought to be admitted; and that if the
 Pope's Holiness and the Cardinals would not give audience to me and your
 Highness's said Counsel, for the manifest trial and showing of the truth, they
 should give us cause to complain upon them, and to cry out, <hi>usque ad
 Sidera,</hi> your Highness's Ambassadors all affirming the same. Then the said
 Cardinal <hi>de Monte</hi> said, that the Pope's Holiness would provide for the
 Disputations, notwithstanding the term <hi>peremptory</hi> assigned, and said
 also, that in the Morning he would speak with the Pope, and give your
 Ambassadors and me an answer.</p>
                  <p>In the morning, which was the 20<hi>th</hi> of this present,
 the said Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal would, that nothing of the Decree of Intimation should be
 mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, because the other part had a Copy thereof, but would the Pope's
 Holiness to give an order that the word <hi>peremptory</hi> should be only for
 Disputations to be had in the Consistory, and not in Congregations, in which
 Congregations, the Conclusions remaining might be disputed; and tho they had
 drawn out this Order, yet because it was nothing plain, neither certain to be
 conformable to the former Order, I would have had the said Cardinal to speak to
 the said Datary for to make it as afore: and he was then contented, howbeit the
 Pope's Holiness commanded all the Cardinals to their places, so that I could
 not have the said Order, and was driven thereby either to dispute and accept
 the term, <hi>tanquam peremptorium,</hi> or else to fly the Disputations,
 giving occasion to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Party to say, that I diffided in the justness
 of the Matters, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Conclusions. Whereupon your Highness's
 Ambassadors and we, with other your Learned Counsel, concluded, that I
 <hi>Edward Karne</hi> should protest, <hi>De non consentiendo in termino,
 tanquam perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> and afterward to proceed to the proposing of the
 Conclusions, and so I did by mouth according to the tenour of a Copy, which
 here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al your Highness shall receive. When I had protested, and the Pope
 had spoken this word <hi>Acceptamus,</hi> the Queen's Advocate began to protest
 that they would dispute no more, and desired his Holiness to proceed in the
 principal Cause. Then I <hi>Edward Karne</hi> said, That the Pope's Holiness
 did well perceive, that the Conclusions were published and proposed, not only
 for them to dispute, but also for all other, come who would, for the
 information of his Holiness, and the whole Consistory. And therefore I said,
 that tho they would not dispute, yet I was there, with other your Highness's
 Learned Counsel, to propose the Conclusions, according to the Order given,
 justifying them to be Canonical, and ready to defend them against all those
 that would gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say them; and thereupon desired the Pope's Holiness, that tho
 the Counsel of the Party Adverse would not dispute, yet I with your 
 <pb n="116" facs="tcp:104314:276"/> Highness's Learned Counsel might be heard again; against
 which my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the Queen's Advocate made great exclamations, till at the last
 the Pope commanded him to silence, and willed us to go to the Conclusions,
 which we did.</p>
                  <p>And here now it is determined, That we shall have no more
 Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the Consistory, but the rest of the Conclusions to be disputed
 in Congregations before the Pope, purposely made for the same; and what therein
 shall be determined or done, your Highness from time to time shall thereof by
 us be advertised, and of all other our doings in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning the Letters which your Highness sent by
 <hi>Francis</hi> the Courier, of the last of <hi>February,</hi> as well to the
 Pope, as to me <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Karne,</hi> for the admission of me and the Matter
 excusatory, we shall, according to your Highness's pleasure and order assigned,
 in the common Letter sent unto us by your said Highness, proceed and do therein
 as may be most beneficial and profitable for the same.</p>
                  <p>And thus most humbly we commend us to your Highness,
 beseeching Almighty God to preserve the same in felicity and health many years.

13.</note>PLeaseth it your Highness, sithen our Letters of the 23 of
 <hi>March,</hi> here hath been great labour, and solliciting, to bring the
 Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation publick out of the Consistory kept once in the week, into the
 Congregations, to be observed and kept before the Pope's Holiness and the
 Cardinals, in such place, and as oft as should please them; to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as
 we perceived, that the said Disputation might be the sooner ended, and not take
 such effect as it was devised for. And upon this great importune labour, I,
 <hi>Edward Karne,</hi> was monished oftentimes to send Conclusions to be
 proposed in the said Congregations, as well in <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> week, as in
 <hi>Easter</hi>-week, as appeareth by the Copies of the Intimations sent
 herewithal to your Highness: Upon which Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I delivered certain
 Conclusions, according to the order taken at the beginning, with a Protestation
 devised by your Grace's Counsel here, <hi>De non recedendo ab eodem ordine,
 &amp; de proponendo easdem Conclusiones <pb n="117" facs="tcp:104314:276"/> in Consistorio,
 juxta eundem ordinem &amp; non aliter.</hi> That notwithstanding the Pope's
 Holiness caused me to be monished again, <hi>cum Comminatione,</hi> that if I
 would not come in, <hi>cum Advocatis,</hi> the third day of <hi>April,
 procederet ad ulteriora protestatione me a praevia non obstante.</hi>
 Whereupon, with the advice of your said Learned Counsel, I conceived a
 Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the same delivered to the Pope's Holiness the said third day
 in the morning, protesting as it was therein contained, and causing it to be
 registred by the Datary; of the which Protestation your Highness shall also
 receive a Copy herewithal. This notwithstanding, the Pope's Holiness, the said
 third day in the afternoon made a Congregation, where the said Protestation was
 examined; and after the Treaty had upon the same, we were in conclusion
 remitted again to the Consistory, there to be heard, as much as the Consistory
 intendeth to hear, upon the Conclusions that are published; which was much more
 beneficial to us, than to have had all proposed in Congregations to have been
 kept, as is afore. And by this means the Matter was shifted off, and deferred
 unto the 10<hi>th</hi> of this month; at which time the Pope's Holiness kept
 the Consistory. And one Mr. <hi>Providal,</hi> a singular good Clerk, which
 came from <hi>Bonony</hi> for the furtherance of your Highness's Cause, very
 compendiously, and after good fashion and handling, to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation,
 as appeared, of the Audience there, purposed three Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the which
 two concerned the habilitation of me <hi>Edward Karne,</hi> to lay in the
 Matters Excusatory: And the third was, that the Cause ought to be committed,
 <hi>extra curiam, ad locum tutum utrique parti:</hi> Of the which Conclusions,
 and also his Sayings, the said 10<hi>th</hi> day, your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall receive
 a Copy here-withal. And forasmuch as at the said Consistory, neither the
 <hi>Imperials,</hi> neither yet the Queens Counsel did appear; I, <hi>Edward
 Karne,</hi> with the advice of your Highness's Counsel, said to the Pope's
 Holiness, after the Proposition made by Mr. <hi>Providel,</hi> that his
 Holiness might perceive well, that if the Party adverse had any good matter to
 alledg, against such things as were deduced for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of the
 Conclusions, and matter Excusatory, and did not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide of their part, they
 would not have absented themselves, or shrun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Disputations, which
 they afore had accepted and taken; wherefore I accused their contumacy and
 absence, desiring that it might be enacted, and thereupon departed from the
 Consistory, for that day dissolved.</p>
                  <p>The 14<hi>th</hi> of this present, the Pope's Holiness caused
 Intimation to be made unto me, of the Consistory to be kept the 17<hi>th</hi>
 of the same; willing me to be there, <hi>cum Advocatis,</hi> to dispute all the
 Conclusions not proposed and disputed: Upon the which Intimation, I delivered
 to the Datary three Conclusions, the 19, the 20, and the 21 in order, with a
 Protestation devised by your Learned Counsel, sent here-withal to your
 Highness: And in the said Consistory, Mr. <hi>Providel</hi> did also alledg for
 the justification of the Matters and Conclusions; and over that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to
 such Objections as he thought the Party adverse to make foundation upon, and
 that very compendiously, being sorry that the <hi>Imperials,</hi> and Queen's
 Counsel, did not come in to dispute the said Conclusions, and the sayings of
 the said Mr. <hi>Providel</hi> in the said Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, with my Protestation
 also, in not agreeing to the term, as <hi>peremptory,</hi> your Highness shall
 perceive in writing sent here-withal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:104314:277"/>As concerning the seven Conclusions yet
 remaining undisputed, we think the Pope's Holiness will hear us no further in
 the Consistory; saying, that the Part adverse will not abide the Disputations,
 nor come in to the same: Nevertheless to take otherwise out of the Consistory,
 with the Cardinals Information, his Holiness is well contented.</p>
                  <p>And verily, Sir, to study, labour, set forward, and call upon
 such things as may confer to the advancement of the Matter, and your
 High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's Purpose, there shall not want, neither good will, neither
 dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to the uttermost, that we
 can excogitate or desire, as hitherto surely neither Party hath failed;
 trusting in God that thereby, if Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice be not oppressed, some good effect
 shall follow, to the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of your Highness. With these Presents,
 your Highness shall also receive a Copy of all things that were spoken, as well
 for your Highness's behalf, as by the Party adverse, in the Consistory, the
 20<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>March.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus most humbly we commend us to your Highness,
 beseeching Almighty God long to continue the same in his most Royal Estate.

                  <p>WHere before this time the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the
 King's most noble Progenitors, and the Nobles of the same, have been founded,
 ordained, and established, in the Estate and degree of Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Dignities, and
 other Promotions Spiritual, to the intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the said Prelates,
 and other Persons, having the said Dignities and Promotions Spiritual,
 continually should be abiding, and Reseants upon their said Promotions within
 this Realm; and also keep, use, and exercise Hospitality, Divine Services,
 teaching and preaching of the <pb n="122" facs="tcp:104314:279"/> Laws of Almighty God, to
 such Persons as were and have been within the precinct of their Promotions or
 Dignities, for the Wealth of the Souls of their Givers and Founders, greatly to
 the honour of Almighty God. Of the which said Spiritual Persons, the King's
 Highness, and his most noble Progenitors, have had right honourable, and
 well-learned Personages, apt, meet, and convenient, for to guide and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
 his Highness, and his most noble Progenitors, in their Counsels, concerning as
 well their Outward as Inward Affairs, to be devised and practised for the
 utility and preservation of this Realm; by reason whereof the Issues, Revenues,
 Profits, and Treasure, rising and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the said Spiritual Promotions and
 Dignities, were and should be spent, employed, and converted within this Realm,
 to the great profit and commodity of the King's Subjects of the same. And where
 also by the laudable Laws and Provisions of this Realm, before this time made,
 it hath been ordained, used, and established, that no Person nor Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, of
 whatsoever Estate, Degree, or Quality he or they were, should take or receive
 within this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> to Farm, by any Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, Writ, Letter
 of Attorney, Administrations, by Indenture, or by any other Mean, any Benefice,
 or other Promotion within this Realm, of any Person or Persons, but only of the
 King's true and lawful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, being born under the King's Dominions. And
 also that no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Persons, of what estate and degree soever he or they
 were, by reason of any such Farm, Procuracie, Letter of Attorney,
 Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, Indenture, or by any other mean, as is aforesaid, should
 car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, conveigh, or cause to be carried and conveighed out of this Realm, any
 Gold, Silver, Treasure, or other Commodity, by Letter of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or by way
 of Merchandise, or otherwise, for any of the Causes aforesaid, to the profit or
 commodity of any Alien, or other Stranger, being born out of this Realm, having
 any such Promotion Spiritual within the same, without license of the King's
 Highness, by the advice of his Council, as by the same Laws, Statutes, and
 Provisions, more plainly at large it may appear; which said laudable Laws,
 Statutes, and Provisions, were made, devised, and ordained, by great policy and
 foresight of the King's most noble Progenitors, the Nobles and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of this
 Realm, for the great profit, utility, and benefit of the same, to the intent
 that the Gold, Silver, Treasure, Riches, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of the same, by
 the occasion aforesaid, should not be exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, employed, converted, and
 otherwise transported out of this Realm and Dominions of the same, to the use,
 profit, and commodity of any Stranger being born out of this Realm, or the
 Dominions of the same; But only to be spent, and used, and bestowed within the
 same, to the great comfort and consolation of the Subjects of this Realm.
 Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which said wholsome Laws, Statutes, and Provisions, the King's
 Highness being a Prince of great benignity and liberality, having no knowledg,
 nor other due information, or instruction of the same Laws, Statutes, and
 Provisions, heretofore hath nominated, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and promoted,
 <hi>Laurence Campegius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> with all the Spiritual
 and Temporal Possessions, Promotions, and other Emoluments and Commodities in
 any wise belonging or appertaining to the same: And also hath nominated,
 preferred, and promoted, <hi>Hierome,</hi> being another Stranger, born out of
 the King's said Realm and Dominions, to <pb n="123" facs="tcp:104314:279"/> the See and
 Bishoprick of <hi>Worcester,</hi> with all the Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
 Promotions, and other Emoluments and Commodities, in any wise belonging or
 appertaining to the same. Which said two Bishops, and namely the Bishop of
 <hi>Sarum,</hi> nothing regarding their Duties to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, nor their
 Cures of the said Bishopricks, eversith or for the more part of the time of
 their said Promotions or Profections into the same, have been, and yet be
 resident, dwelling and abiding at the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elsewhere, in
 other parts beyond the Sea, far out and from any of the King's said Dominions;
 by reason whereof, the great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality, Divine Service, teaching and
 Preaching the Laws, and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of good living, and the other good and
 necessary effects before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, have been many years by-past, and yet
 continually be, not only withdrawn, decayed, hindred, and minished, but also
 great quantity of Gold, Silver, and Treasure, to the yearly sum and value of
 3000 <hi>l.</hi> at the least, have been yearly taken and conveighed out of
 this Realm, to the singular profit, and great enriching of the said Bishops,
 and daily is like to be conveighed, transported, and sent, contrary to the
 pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and effect of the said former wholsome Laws and Statutes, to the great
 impoverishing of this Realm, as well presently as for to come, if speedy remedy
 be not had therefore in brief time provided. In consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof, be it
 enacted by the Authority of this present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that the said two several
 Sees and Bishopricks of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> and either
 of them from henceforth, shall be taken, reputed, and accounted in the Law to
 be utterly void, vacant, and utterly desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any Incumbent, or Prelate,

                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:104314:281"/> how benign and
 merciful the Prince was: And that I thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for you to write unto
 his Highness, and to recognize your Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and desire his pardon, which his
 Grace would not deny you now in your age and sickness; which my counsel I would
 you had followed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to have written these Letters to me, excusing
 your self altho there were no manner of default in you. But, my Lord, if it
 were in an other manner of case than your own, and out of the Matter which ye
 favour, I doubt not but that ye would think him that should have done as ye
 have done, not only worthy heavy Words, but also heavy Deeds; for where ye
 labour to excuse your self of your Hearing, Bribing, and concealing of the
 Maiden's false and feigned Revelations, and of your manifold sending of your
 Chaplains unto her, by a certain intent which ye pretend your self to have had,
 to know by communing with her, or by sending your Chaplains to her, whether for
 Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Word of God, or no, alledging divers Scriptures that ye were
 bound to prove them, and to receive them after they were proved. My Lord,
 whether ye have used a due means to try her and her Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or no, it
 appeareth by the process of your own Letters. For where you write that ye had
 conceived a great opinion of the holiness of this Woman, for many
 considerations rehearsed in your Letters, comprised in six Articles; whereof
 the first is grounded upon the bruit and fame of her; the second, upon her
 entring into Religion after her trances and diffiguration; the third, upon
 rehearsal that her Ghostly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being Learned and Religious, should testify
 that she was a Woman of great holiness; the fourth, upon the report that divers
 other vertuous Priests, Men of good Learning and Reputation, should so testify
 of her, with which Ghostly Father, and Priests, ye never spake, as ye confess
 in your Letters; the fifth, upon the praises of my late Lord of
 <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which shewed you, as ye write, that she had many great
 Visions; the sixth, upon the saying of the Prophet <hi>Amos, Non faciet
 Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus Deus Verbum, nisi revelaverit secretum suum ad servos suos
 Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi> By which Considerations ye were induced to the desire to know
 the very certainty of this Matter, whether these Revelations which were
 pretended to be shewed to her from God, were true Revelations or not. Your
 Lordship in all the sequel of your Letters, shew not that ye made no further
 trial upon the truth of her and her Revelations, but only in communing with
 her, and sending your Chaplains to her with idle Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, as of the 3
 <hi>Mary Magdalens,</hi> by which your communication and sending, ye tried out
 nothing of her falshood, neither (as it is credibly supposed) intended to do as
 ye might have done, in any wise more easily than with communing with her, or
 sending to her; for little credence was to be given to her, affirming her own
 feigned Revelations to be from God; for if credence should be given to every
 such lewd Person as would affirm himself to have Revelations from God, what
 readier way were there to subvert all Common-Weals and good orders in the
 World?</p>
                  <p>Verily, my Lord, if ye had intended to trace out the truth of
 her, and of her Revelations, ye would have taken an other way with you; first,
 you would not have been converted with the vain Voices of the People, making
 bruits of her Trances and Diffiguration, but like a wise, discreet, and
 circumspect Prelate, ye should have examined (as <pb n="125" facs="tcp:104314:281"/> other
 since) such sad and credible Persons as were present at her Traun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and
 Diffigurings, not one or two, but a good number, by whose testimony ye should
 have proved, whether the Bruits of her Traunces and Diffigurations were true or
 not. And likewise ye should have tried by what craft and persuasion she was
 made a Religious Woman; and if ye had been so desirous, as ye pretended, to
 enquire out the truth or falshood of this Woman, and of her Revelations; it is
 to be supposed ye would have spoken with her good, religious, and well-learned
 Ghostly Father e're this time, and also with the vertuous and well-learned
 Priest, (as they were esteemed) of whose reports ye would have been informed by
 them which heard them speak; or ye would also have been minded to see the Book
 of her Revelations, which was offered you, of which ye might have had more
 trial of her and her Revelations, than of a hundred communications with her, or
 of as many sendings of your Chaplains unto her. As for the late Lord of
 <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s saying unto you, That she had many great Visions, it
 ought to move you never a deal to give credence unto her or her Revelations;
 for the said Lord knew no more certainty of her, or of her Revelations, than he
 did by her own report. And as touching the saying of <hi>Amos</hi> the Prophet,
 I think verily the same moved you but a little to hearken unto her; for
 si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence the Consummation and the end of the Old Testament, and sithen the
 Passion of Christ, God hath done many great and notable things in the World,
 whereof he shewed nothing to his Prophets that hath come to the knowledg of
 Men. My Lord, all these things moved you not to give credence unto her, but
 only the very matter whereupon she made her false Prophesies; to which matter
 ye were so affected, as ye be noted to be in all matters which ye enter once
 into, that nothing could come amiss that made for that purpose. And here I
 appeal your Conscience, and instantly desire you to answer, Whether if she had
 shewed you as many Revelations for the confirmation of the King's Graces
 Marriage, which he now enjoyeth, as she did to the contrary, ye would have
 given as much credence to her as the same done, and would have let the trial of
 her and her Revelations, to overpass those many years, where ye dwelt not from
 her but twenty miles in the same Shire where her Traunces, and Diffigurings,
 and Prophesies in her Traunces were surmised, and reported. And if percase ye
 will say (as it not unlike but ye will say, minded as ye were wont to be) that
 the matter be not like, for the Law of God, in your opinion, standeth with the
 one and not with the other: Surely, my Lord, I suppose there had been no great
 cause more to trust the one more than the other; for ye know by Scriptures of
 the Bible, that God may by his Revelation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense with his own Law, as with
 the <hi>Israelites</hi> spoiling the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and with
 <hi>Iacob</hi> to have four Wives, and such other. Think you, my Lord, that any
 indifferent Man, considering the quality of the Matter, and your Affections,
 and also the negligent passing over of such lawful Trials as ye might have had
 of the said Maiden, and her Revelations, is so dull, that cannot perceive and
 discern that your communing, and often sending to the said Maid, was rather to
 hear and bruit many of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, than to try out the truth or falshood
 of the same. And in this Business, I suppose, it will be hard for you to purge
 your self before God, or the World, but that ye have been in great default in
 hearing, <pb n="126" facs="tcp:104314:282"/> believing, and concealing such things as tended
 to the destruction of the Prince; and that her Revelations were bent and
 purposed to that end, it hath been duly proved afore as great Assembly and
 Council of the Lords of this Realm, as hath been seen many years meet out of a
 Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And what the said Lords deemed them worthy to suffer, which said,
 heard, believed, and concealed those false Revelations, be more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible than
 any threats spoken by me to your Brother.</p>
                  <p>And where ye go about to defend, that ye be not to be blamed
 for concealing the Revelations concerning the King's Grace, because ye thought
 it not necessary to rehearse them to his Highness, for six Causes following in
 your Letters; afore I shew you my mind concerning these Causes, I suppose that
 albeit you percase thought it not necessary to be shewed to the Prince by you,
 yet that your thinking shall not be your Trial, but the Law must define whether
 ye oughted to utter it or not.</p>
                  <p>And as to the first of the said seven Causes; Albeit she told
 you that she had shewed her Revelations concerning the King's Grace to the King
 her self; yet her saying, or others, discharged not you, but that ye were
 bound, by your fidelity, to shew to the King's Grace that thing which seemed to
 concern his Grace and his Reign so nighly: for how knew you that she shewed
 these Revelations to the King's Grace, but by her own saying, to which ye
 should have given no such credence, as to forbear the utterance of so great
 Matters concerning a King's Weal? And why should you so sinisterly judg the
 Prince, that if ye had shewed the same unto him, he would have thought that ye
 had brought that tale unto him, more for the strengthening and confirmation of
 your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, than for any other thing else. Verily, my Lord, whatsoever your
 Judgment be, I see daily such benignity and excellent humanity in his Grace,
 that I doubt not but his Highness would have accepted it in good part, if ye
 had shewed the same Revelations unto him, as ye were bounden by your
 fidelity.</p>
                  <p>To the second Cause; Albeit she shewed you not that any
 Prince, or other Temporal Lord, should put the King's Grace in danger of his
 Crown; yet there were ways enough by which her said Revelations might have put
 the King's Grace in danger, as the foresaid Council of Lords have substantially
 and duly considered: And therefore albeit she shewed you not the means whereby
 the danger should ensue to the King, yet ye were nevertheless bounden to shew
 him of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>To the third; Think you, my Lord, that if any Person would
 come unto you, and shew you, that the King's destruction were conspired against
 a certain time, and would fully shew you that he were sent from his Master to
 shew the same to the King, and will say further un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, he would go
 streight to the King; were it not yet your duty to certify the King's Grace of
 this Revelation, and also to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the said Person had done his
 foresaid Message or no? Yes verily, and so were ye bound, tho the Maiden shewed
 you it was her Message from God to be declared by her to the King's Grace.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth; Here ye translate the temporal Duty that ye owe
 to your Prince, to the spiritual Duty of such as be bound to declare the Word
 of God to the People, and to shew unto them the ill and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 
 <pb n="127" facs="tcp:104314:282"/> of it in another World; the concealment whereof
 pertaineth to the Judgment of God, but the concealment of this Matter
 pertaineth to other Judges of this Realm.</p>
                  <p>To the fifth; There could no blame be imputed to you, if ye
 had shewed the Maidens Revelation to the King's Grace, albeit they were
 afterward found false, for no Man ought to be blamed doing his Duty: And if a
 Man would shew you secretly, that there were a great Mischief intended against
 the Prince, were ye to be blamed if ye shewed him of it; albeit it was a
 feigned talk, and the said mischief were never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
                  <p>To the sixth; Concerning an Imagination of Mr. <hi>Pary,</hi>
 it was known that he was beside himself, and therefore they were not blamed
 that made no report thereof; but it was not like in this case, for ye took not
 this Maiden for a mad Woman, for if ye had, ye would not have given unto her so
 great credence as ye did.</p>
                  <p>To the final, and seventh Cause; Where ye lay unto the charge
 of our Sovereign, that so hath unkindly entreated you with grievous Words, and
 terrible Letters, for shewing his Grace truth in his great Matter, whereby ye
 were discomforted to shew unto him the Maidens Revelations: I believe that I
 know the King's Goodness, and natural Gentleness so well, that his Grace would
 not so unkindly handled you, as your unkindly writings him, unless ye gave him
 other Causes than be expressed in your Letters. And whatsoever the King's Grace
 hath said or written unto you heretofore, yet notwithstanding ye were
 neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less bounden to utter to him those pernicious Revelations.</p>
                  <p>Finally; Where ye desire, for the Passion of Christ, that ye
 be no more twitched in this matter, for if ye be put to that strait, ye will
 not lose your Soul, but ye will speak as your Conscience bindeth you, with many
 more words of great courage. My Lord, if ye had taken my counsel sent unto you
 by your Brother, and followed the same, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting your self, by your Letters,
 at the King's Grace, for your offences in this behalf, I would have trusted
 that ye should never be quykkrand in this matter more. But now, where ye take
 upon you to defend the whole Matter, as ye were in no default, I cannot so far
 promise you: And surely, my Lord, if the Matter come to trial, your own
 confession in this Letter, besides the Witness which be against you, will be
 suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to condemn you: Wherefore, my Lord, I will eft-soons advise you,
 That laying apart all such excuses as ye have alledged in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which
 in my opinion be of small effect, as I have declared, ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech the King's
 Grace, by your Letters, to be your Gracious Lord, and to remit unto you your
 negligence, over-sight, and offence, committed against his Highness in this
 behalf; and I dare undertake that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall benignly accept you into
 his gracious favour, all matters of displeasure past afore this time forgotten
 and forgiven. As touching the speaking of your Conscience, It is thought that
 ye have written and have spoken as much as ye can, and many things, as some
 right probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, against your own Conscience: and many report, that at
 the last Convocation, ye spake many things which ye could not well defend; and
 therefore it is not greatly feared what ye can say or write in that Matter,
 howsoever ye be qukkrane and startled. And if ye had taken,

 and pretensed Jurisdiction of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> within this Realm:
 and for the assertion and confirmation of the Authority, Jurisdiction, and
 Prerogative of our most noble Sovereign Lord the King, and his Successors; and
 that they shall diligently instruct their Juniors and Youngers, and all other
 committed to their Cure, That the King's Power is by the Laws of God most
 excellent of all under God in Earth; and that we ought to obey him afore all
 other Powers, by God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

 and that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Jurisdiction or Authority here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
 usurped, by no means is founded or established by Holy Scripture: but that the
 same, partly by the craft and deceit of the same Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
 by his evil and ambitious Canons and Decretals; and partly by the toleration
 and permission of Princes, by little and little hath grown up; and therefore
 now, of most right and equity, is taken away and clean expelled out of his
 Realm.</p>
                  <p>Also, that the Abbot, Prior, or President and Brethren, may be

 Superiority to the said Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to any other Forreign

 Statutes to be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with utterly put forth and abolished out of the Books, or

 utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluded from entring into the Limits or Circuit of this Monastery, or
 place, unless they first obtain license of the King's Highness, or his
 Visitor.</p>
                  <p>Also, that there be no entring into this Monastery but one,
 and that by the great fore-gate of the same, which diligently shall be watched
 and kept by some Porter specially appointed for that purpose, and shall be shut
 and opened by the same both day and night, at convenient and accustomed hours;
 which Porter shall repel all manner Women from entrance into the said
 Monastery.</p>
                  <p>Also, that all and singular Brethren, and Monks of this
 Monastery, take their refections altogether in a place called the
 <hi>Misericorde,</hi> such days as they eat Flesh, and all other days in their
 Refectory; and that at every Mess there sit four of them, not of duty demanding
 to them any certain, usual, or accustomed duty or portion of Meat as they were
 wont to do; but that they be content with such Victuals as is set before them,
 and there take their Refections soberly, without excess, with giving due 
 <pb n="139" facs="tcp:104314:288"/> thanks to God; and that at every such Refection, some
 Chapter of the New Testament, or Old, by some of the said Brethren, be read and
 recited to the other, keeping silence, and giving audience to the same.</p>

 for himself and his Guests thither resorting, and that not over-sumptuous and
 full of delicate and strange Dishes, but honestly furnished with common Meats;
 At which Table, the said Abbot, or some Senior in his stead, shall sit to
 receive, and gently entertain the Strangers, the Guests.</p>
                  <p>Also, that none of the Brethren send any part of his Meat, or
 the leavings thereof to any Person, but that there be assigned an Almoner,
 which shall gather the Leavings, both of the Covent and Strangers Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
 after that the Servants of the House have had their convenient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and
 distribute the same to poor People; amongst whom special consideration be had
 of such, before other, as be Kinsfolk to any of the said Brethren, if they be
 of like power and debility as other be; and also of those which endeavour
 themselves, with all their will and labour, to get their living with their
 hands, and yet cannot fully help themselves for their chargeable Houshold, and
 multitude of Children: yet let not them be so cherished, that they shall leave
 labour and fall to idleness; with consideration also specially to be had of
 them, which by weakness of their Limbs and Body be so impotent that they cannot
 labour; and by no means let such Alms be given to valiant mighty and idle
 Beggars and Vagabonds, as commonly use to resort about such places; which
 rather, as drove-Beasts and Mychers, should be driven away and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to
 labour, than in their idleness and lewdness, against the form of the King's
 Graces Statute in this behalf made, cherished, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to the great
 hindrance and damage of the Common-Weal.</p>
                  <p>Also, that all other Almses or Destributions due, or
 accustomed to be made, by reason of the Foundation, Statutes, or customes of
 this place, be made and given, as largely and as liberally as ever they were at
 any time heretofore.</p>
                  <p>Also, that the Abbot, Prior, or President, shall find Wood and

 <hi>Iubilee,</hi> lie together in the Dormitory, every one by himself, in
 several Beds.</p>
                  <p>Also, that no Brother, or Monk, of this House, have any Child
 or Boy laying, or privily accompanying with him, or otherwise haunting unto
 him, other than to help him to Mass.</p>
                  <p>Also, that the Brethren of this House, when they be sick, or
 evil at ease, be seen unto, and be kept in the Infirmary duly, as well for
 their sustenance of Meat and Drink, as for their good keeping.</p>
                  <p>Also, that the Abbot, or President, keep and find in some
 Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, one or two of his Brothers, according to the Ability and
 Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this House; which Brethren, after they be learned in good and
 holy Letters, when they return home, may instruct and teach their Brethren, and
 diligently preach the Word of God.</p>

 one hour, a Lesson of Holy Scripture be kept in this Covent, to which all,
 under pain by this said President to be moderated, shall resort; which
 President shall have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to dispense with them, that they, with a low
 and treatable voice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> say their long hours, which were wont to be sung.</p>
                  <p>Also, that the Brethren of this House, after Divine Service
 done, read or hear somewhat of Holy Scripture, or occupy themself in some such
 like honest and laudable exercise.</p>
                  <p>Also, that all and every Brethren of this House shall observe
 the Rule, Statutes, and laudable Customs of this Religion, as far as they do
 agree with Holy Scripture and the Word of God. And that the Abbot, Prior, or
 President of this Monastery, every day shall expound to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as
 plainly as may be, in English, a certain part of the Rule that they have
 professed, and apply the same always to the Doctrine of Christ, and not
 contrariwise; and he shall teach them, that the said Rule, and other their
 Principles of Religion (so far as they be lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) be taken out of Holy
 Scripture; and he shall show them the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from whence they were derived;
 and that their Ceremonies, and other observances of Religion, be none other
 things than as the first Letters or Principles, and certain Introductions to
 true Christianity, or to observe an order in the Church. And that true Religion
 is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Apparel, manner of going, shaven Heads, and such other
 marks; nor in silence, fasting, up-rising in the night, singing, and such other
 kind of Ceremonies, but in cleanness of mind, pureness of living, Christ's
 Faith not feigned, and brotherly Charity, and true honouring of God in Spirit
 and Verity: And that those above-said things were instituted and begun, that
 they being first exercised in these, in process of time might ascend to those
 as by certain steps, that is to say, to the chief point and end of Religion:
 and therefore let them be diligently exhorted, that they do not continually
 stick and surcease in such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Observances, as tho they had
 perfectly fulfilled the chief and outmost of the whole true Religion; but that
 when they have once past such things, they endeavour themselves to higher
 things, and convert their minds from such external Matters, to more inward and
 deeper Considerations, as the Law of God and Christian Religion doth teach and
 show. And that they assure not themselves of any Reward or Commodity any wise,
 by reason of such Ceremonies and Observances, except they refer all such to
 Christ, and for his sake observe them; and for that they might thereby the more
 easily keep such things as he hath commanded, as well to them as to all
 Christian People.</p>
                  <p>Also, that the Abbot and President of this Place shall make a
 full and true reckoning and accompt of his Administration every year to his
 Brethren, as well of his Receipts as Expences; and that the said Accompt be
 written in a great Book remaining with the Covent.</p>
                  <p>Also, that the Abbot and President of this House shall make no
 waste of the Woods pertaining to this House, nor shall set out unadvisedly any
 Farmes or Reversions, without the consent of the more part of the Convent.</p>
                  <p>Also, that there be assigned a Book and a Register that may
 copy out into that Book all such Writings, word by word, as shall pass under
 the Convent-Seal of this House.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:104314:289"/>Also, that no Man be suffered to
 profess, or to wear the Habit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this House e're he be 24 years of
 Age compleat; And that they entice nor allure no Man with suasions and
 blandyments to take the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> that they shall not shew no Reliques, or
 feigned Miracles, for encrease of Lucre, but that they exhort Pilgrims and
 Strangers to give that to the Poor, that they thought to offer to their Images
 or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</p>
                  <p>Also, that they shall suffer no Fairs, or Markets, to be kept
 or used within the limits of this House.</p>
                  <p>Also, that every Brother of this House that is a Priest, shall
 every day in his Mass, pray for the most happy and most prosperous estate of
 our Sovereign Lord the King, and his most noble and lawful Wife Queen
 <hi>Ann.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also, that if either the Master, or any Brother of this House,
 do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe any of the said Injunctions, any of them shall denounce the same,
 or procure to be denounced, as soon as may be, to the King's Majesty, or to his
 Visitor-General, or his Deputy. And the Abbot, or Master, shall minister
 spending Mony, and other Necessaries, for the way to him that shall so
 denounce.</p>
                  <p>Other Spiritual Injunctions may be added by the Visitor, as
 the place and nature of the Comperts shall require, after his discretion.</p>

                     <p>IT seems there was generally a Confession made with the
Surrender: Of these some few are yet extant, though undoubtedly great care was
taken to destroy as many as could be in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time. That long
and full one made by the Prior of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Northampton,</hi>
the Preamble whereof is printed by <hi>Fuller,</hi> and is at large printed by

  our Ordinaries and Diocesans: submitting our selves principally to Forinsecal
  Potentates and Powers, which never came here to reform such disorders of living
  and abuses. as now have been found to have reigned amongst us. And therefore
  now assuredly knowing, that the most perfect way of living, is most principally
  and sufficiently declared unto us by our Master Christ, his Evangelists and
  Apostles, and that it is most expedient for us to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and ordered by

  and becking, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scapulars and Hoods, and other-like Papistical
  Ceremonies, wherein we have been most principally practised and noseled in
  times past; but the very true way to please God, and to live a true Christian
  Man, without all hypocrisy and feigned dissimulation, is sincerely declared to
  us by our Master Christ, his Evangelists, and Apostles; being minded hereafter
  to follow the same, conforming our self to the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our
  Supream Head, under God, on Earth, the King's Majesty; and not to follow
  henceforth, the superstitious Traditions of any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinsecal Potentate or Power,

10.</note>YOur Grace's displeasure, and my Imprisonment, are things so strange
 unto me, as what to write, or what to excuse, I am altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.
 Whereas you send unto me (willing me to confess a Truth, and so obtain your
 favour) by such an one whom you know to be mine ancient professed Enemy. I no
 sooner received this Message by him, than I rightly conceived your meaning; and
 as if, as you say, confessing a Truth indeed may procure my safety, I shall
 with all wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness and duty perform your Command.</p>
                  <p>But let not your Grace ever imagine that your poor Wife will
 ever be brought to acknowledg a Fault, where not so much as a thought thereof
 preceded. And to speak a Truth, never Prince had Wife more loyal in all duty,
 and in all true affection, than you have ever found in <hi>Ann Boleyn,</hi>
 with which Name and Place I could willingly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented my self, if God,
 and your Grace's pleasure had been so pleased. Neither did I at any time so far
 forget my self in my Exaltation, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Queenship, but that I always
 looked for such an alteration as now I find; for the ground of my preferment
 being on no surer Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than your Grace's Fancy, the least alteration, I
 knew, was fit and sufficient to draw that Fancy to some other Subject. You have
 cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen me, from a low estate, to be your Queen and Companion, far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my
 desert or desire. If then you found me worthy of such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Good your Grace
 let not any light Fancy, or bad counsel of mine Enemies, withdraw your Princely
 Favour from me; neither let that Stain, that unworthy stain of a disloyal heart
 towards your good Grace, ever cast so foul a blot on your most dutiful Wife,
 and the <pb n="155" facs="tcp:104314:296"/> Infant-Princess your Daughter: Try me, good
 King, but let me have a lawful Trial, and let not my sworn Enemies sit as my
 Accusers and Judges; yea, let me receive an open Trial, for my Truth shall fear
 no open shame; then shall you see, either mine innocency cleared, your
 suspicion and Conscience satisfied, the ignominy and slander of the World
 stopped, or my Guilt openly declared. So that whatsoever God or you may
 determine of me, your Grace may be freed from an open censure; and mine Offence
 being so lawfully proved, your Grace is at liberty, both before God and Man,
 not only to execute worthy punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on me as an unlawful Wife, but to follow
 your Affection, already setled, on that Party, for whose sake I am now as I am,
 whose Name I could some good while since have pointed unto: your Grace being
 not ignorant of my suspicion therein.</p>
                  <p>But if you have already determined of me, and that not only my
 Death, but an infamous slander must bring you the enjoying of your desired
 happiness; then I desire of God, that he will pardon your great sin therein,
 and likewise mine Enemies, the Instruments thereof; and that he will not call
 you to a strict account for your unprincely and cruel usage of me, at his
 General Judgment-Seat, where both you and my self must shortly appear, and in
 whose Judgment I doubt not (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the World may think of me) mine
 Innocence shall be openly known, and sufficiently cleared.</p>
                  <p>My last and only request shall be, That my self may only bear
 the burthen of your Grace's displeasure, and that it may not touch the
 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Souls of those poor Gentlemen, who (as I understand) are likewise in
 strait Imprisonment for my sake. If ever I have found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in your sight, if
 ever the Name of <hi>Ann Boleyn</hi> hath been pleasing in your ears, then let
 me obtain this request; and I will so leave to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Grace any further,
 with mine earnest Prayers to the Trinity to have your Grace in his good
 keeping, and to direct you in all your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. From my doleful Prison in the

                     <hi>V.</hi> The Iudgment of the Convocation concerning
 General-Councils. Published by the L. <hi>Herbert</hi> from the
 Original.</head>
                  <p>AS concerning General-Councils, like-as we (taught by long
 ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) do perfectly know that there never was, nor is, any thing devised,
 invented, or instituted by our Fore-Fathers, more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient or more necessary
 for the establishment of our Faith, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Heresies, and the
 abolishing of Sects and Schisms; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, for the reducing of Christ's
 People unto one perfect unity and concord in his Religion, than by the having
 of General-Councils. So <pb n="156" facs="tcp:104314:297"/> that the same be lawfully had
 and congregated in <hi>Spiritu Sancto,</hi> and be also conform and agreeable,
 as well concerning the surety and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of the Places, as all other
 Points requisite and necessary for the same, unto that wholsome and godly
 Institution and usage, for the which they were at first devised and used in the
 Primitive Church. Even so on the other side, taught by like experience, we
 esteem, repute, and judg, That there is, ne can be any thing in the World more
 pestilent and pernicious to the Common-weal of Christendom, or whereby the
 Truth of God's Word hath in times past, or hereafter may be sooner defaced or
 subverted, or whereof hath and may ensue more contention, more discord and
 other devilish effects, than when such General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils have or shall be
 assembled, not christianly nor charitably, but for and upon private malice and
 ambition, or other worldly and carnal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects and Considerations, according
 to the saying of <hi>Gregory Nazianze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in his Epistle to one
 <hi>Procopius,</hi> wherein he writeth this Sentence following; <hi>Sic sentio,
 si verum scribendum est, omnes Conventus Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum fugiendos esse, quia
 nullius Synodi finem vidi bonum, neque habentem magis solutionem malorum, quam
 incrementum: Nam cupiditates contentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, &amp; gloria (sed ne putes me
 odiosum ista scribentem) vincunt rationem.</hi> That is to say; 
 <q>I think this, if I should write truly, That all General
Councils be to be eschewed, for I never saw that they produced any good End or
Effect, nor that any Provision or Remedy, but rather increase of Mischiefs
proceeded of them. For the desire of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Men's Opinions and
ambition of Glory (but reckon not that I write this of malice) hath always in
them overcomed reason.</q> Wherefore we think that Christian Princes,
 especially and above all things, ought and must, with all their wills, power,
 and diligence, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see and provide; <hi>Ne Sanctissima hac in parte majorum
 Instituta, ad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probissimos ambitionis aut malitiae effectus explendos,

 ferat.</hi> That is to say, 
 <q> Least the most noble wholsome Institutions of our El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in this behalf be, perverted to a most contrary and most wicked end and effect;
that is to say, to fulfil and satisfy the wicked affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men's Ambition
and Malice; or, lest they might prevail for any other colour, or bring forth
any other effect than their most vertuous and laudable countenance doth
outwardly to the World shew or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</q> And first of all we think that
 they ought principally to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who hath the Authority to call together a
 General Council. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether the Causes alledged be so weighty and so
 urgent, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily they require a General Council, nor can otherwise be
 remedied. Thirdly, Who ought to be Judges in the General Council. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
 What order of proceeding is to be observed in the same, and how the Opinions or
 Judgments of the Fathers are to be consulted or asked. Fifthly, What Doctrines
 are to be allowed or defended, with diverse other things which in General
 Councils ought of reason and equity to be observed. And as unto the first
 Point, We think that neither the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any one Prince,
 of what estate, degree, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence soever he be, may by his own
 Authority, call, indite, or summon any General Council without the express
 consent, assent, and agreement of the residue of Christian Princes, and
 especially such as <pb n="157" facs="tcp:104314:297"/> have within their own Realms and
 Seigniories, <hi>Imperium merum,</hi> that is to say, of such as have the
 whole, intire, and supream Government and Authority over all their Subjects,
 without knowledging or recognizing of any other supream Power or Authority. And
 this to be true, we be induced to think, by many and sundry, as well Examples
 as great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Authority. The which, forasmuch as it should be over-long
 and tedious to express here particularly, we have thought good to omit the same
 for this present. And in witness that this is our plain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
 Sentence, Opinion, and Judgment, touching the Premisses, we the Prelates and
 Clergy under-written, being congregate together in the Convocation of the
 Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and representing the whole Clergy of the same,

 the Name of God, Amen. In the Year of our Lord God one thousand five hundred
 thirty six, and of the most noble Reign of our Sovereign Lord, <hi>Henry</hi>
 the Eighth, King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the 28 Year, and the
 day of I <hi>Thomas Cromwel</hi> Knight, Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> Keeper of the
 Privy-Seal of our said Sovereign Lord the King, and Vicegerent unto the same,
 for and concerning all his Jurisdictions Ecclesiastical within the Realm,
 visiting by the King's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's Supream Authority Ecclesiastical, the People
 and Clergy of this Deanery of by my trusty Commissary lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and
 constitute for this part, have, to the glory of Almighty God, to the King's
 Highness's honour, the publick Weal of this his Realm, and encrease of Vertue
 in the same, appointed and assigned these Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ensuing to be kept and
 observed, of the Dean, Parsons, Vicars, Curates, and Stipendaries, resiant or
 having cure of Soul, or any other Spiritual Administrations within this
 Deanery, under the pains hereafter limited and appointed.</p>
                  <p>The first is; That the Dean, Parsons, Vicars, and other,
 having cure of Soul any-where within this Deanery, shall faithfully keep and
 ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and as far as in them may lie, shall cause to be observed and kept of
 other, all and singular Laws and Statutes of this Realm, made for the
 abolishing and extirpation of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s pretensed and
 usurped Power and Jurisdiction within this Realm. And for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
 and confirmation of the King's Authority and Jurisdiction of the same, as of
 the Supream Head of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and shall, to the uttermost
 of their Wit, Knowledg, and Learning, purely, sincerely, and without any colour
 or dissimulation, declare, manifest, and open, for the space of one quarter of
 a year next ensuing, once every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and after that at the
 least-wise twice every quarter, in their Sermons and other Collations, that the
 Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s usurped Power and Jurisdiction, having no
 establishment nor ground by the Law of God, was of most just causes taken away
 and abolished; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they owe unto him no manner of obedience or
 subjection; and that the King's Power is within his Dominion the highest Power
 and Potentate, under God, to whom all Men within the same Dominions, by God's
 Commandment, owe most loyalty and obedience, afore and above all other Powers
 and Potentates in Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; Whereas certain Articles were lately devised
 and put forth by the King's Highness's Authority, and condescended upon by the
 Prelates and Clergy of this his Realm in Convocation, whereof part are
 neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be holden and believed for our Salvation, and the other part do
 concern and teach certain laudable Ceremonies, Rites, and Usages of the Church,
 meet and convenient to be kept and used for a decent and politick order in the
 same; the said Dean, Parsons, Vicars, and other Curats, shall so open and
 declare in their said Sermons, and other <pb n="161" facs="tcp:104314:299"/> Collations, the
 said Articles unto them that be under their Cure, that they may plainly know
 and discern which of them be necessary to be believed and observed for their
 Salvation, and which be not necessary, but only do concern the decent and
 politick order of the said Church: according to such Commandment and Admonition
 as hath been given unto them heretofore, by Authority of the King's Highness in
 tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> behalf.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, That they shall declare unto all such as be under
 their Cure, the Articles likewise devised, put forth, and authorized of late,
 for and concerning the abrogation of certain superfluous Holy-days, according
 to the effect and purport of the same Articles: and perswade their Parishioners
 to keep and observe the same inviolable, as things honesty provided, decreed,
 and established, by common consent, and publick Authority, for the Weal,
 Commodity, and Profit of all this Realm.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, to the intent that all Superstition and
 Hypocrisie, crept into divers Mens hearts may vanish away, they shall not set
 forth or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol any Images, Reliques, or Miracles, for any superstition or
 lucre; nor allure the People by any inticements to the pilgrimages of any
 Saint, otherwise than is permitted in the Articles lately put forth by the
 Authority of the King's Majesty, and condescended upon by the Prelates and
 Clergy of this his Realm in Convocation; as though it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or peculiar
 to that Saint to give this Commodity, or that: seeing all Goodness, Health, and
 Grace, ought to be both asked and looked for only of God, as of the very Author
 of the same, and of none other, for without him it cannot be given: But they
 shall exhort, as well their Parishioners as other Pilgrims, that they do rather
 apply themselves to the keeping of God's Commandments, and fulfilling of his
 Works of Charity; perswading them that they shall please God more by the true
 exercising of their bodily Labour, Travail, or Occupation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for
 their Families, than if they went about to the said Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and that it
 shall profit more their Souls health, if they do bestow that on the Poor and
 Needy, which they would have bestowed upon the said Images or Reliques.</p>
                  <p>Also in the same their Sermons, and other Collations, the
 Parsons, Vicars, and other Curats, aforesaid, shall diligently admonish the
 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers, Masters and Governors of Youth, being within their Cure,
 to teach, or cause to be taught, their Children and Servants, even from their
 Infancy, their <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> the Articles of our Faith, and the Ten
 Commandments, in their Mother Tongue: And the same so taught, shall cause the
 said Youth oft to repeat and understand. And to the intent that this may be the
 more easily done, the said Curats shall, in their Sermons, deliberately and
 plainly recite of the said <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> the Articles of our Faith,
 and the Ten Commandments, one Clause or Article one day, and an other another
 day, till those be taught and learnt by little; and shall deliver the same in
 writing, or shew where printed Books containing the same be to be sold, to them
 that can read or will desire the same. And thereto that the said Fathers and
 Mothers, <pb n="162" facs="tcp:104314:300"/> Masters and Governors, do bestow their Children
 and Servants, even from their Childhood, either to Learning, or some other
 honest Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, Occupation, or Husbandry: exhorting, counselling, and by all
 the ways and means they may, as well in their said Sermons and Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as
 otherwise, perswading the said Fathers, Mothers, Masters, and other Governors,
 being under their Cure and Charge, diligently to provide and foresee that the
 said Youth be in no manner-wise kept or brought up in idleness, lest at any
 time afterwards they be driven, for lack of some Mystery or Occupation to live
 by, to fall to begging, steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or some other unthriftiness; forasmuch as we
 may daily see, through sloth and idleness, divers valiant Men fall, some to
 begging, and some to theft and murder; which after brought to calamity and
 misery, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute a great part thereof to their Friends and Governors, which
 suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to be brought up so idely in their Youth; where if they had been
 well educated and brought up in some good Literature, Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Mystery,
 they should, being Rulers of their own Family, have profited, as well
 themselves as divers other Persons, to the great commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and ornament of the
 Common-weal.</p>
                  <p>Also, that the said Parsons, Vicars, and other Curats, shall
 diligently provide that the Sacraments and Sacramentals be duly and reverently
 ministred in their Parishes; and if at any time it hapned them, either in any
 of the Cases expressed in the Statutes of this Realm, or of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial license
 given by the King's Majesty to be absent from their Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they shall
 leave their Cure, not to a rude and unlearned Person, but to an honest,
 well-learned, and expert Curate, that may teach the rude and unlearned of their
 Cure wholsome Doctrine, and reduce them to the right way that do err; and
 always let them see, that neither they, nor their Vicars, do seek more their
 own profit, promotion, or advantage, than the profit of the Souls that they
 have under their Cure, or the Glory of God.</p>
                  <p>Also, the said Dean, Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and other
 Priests, shall in no wise, at any unlawful time, nor for any other cause, than
 for their honest necessity, haunt or resort to any Taverns or Ale-houses; And
 after their Dinner and Supper, they shall not give themselves to Drinking or
 Riot, spending their time idely, by Day or by Night, at Tables or
 Cards-playing, or any other unlawful Game; but at such times as they shall have
 such leisure, they shall read or hear somewhat of Holy Scripture, or shall
 occupy themselves with some other honest Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise; and that they alway do
 those things which appertain to good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruence and honesty, with profit of
 the Common-weal, having always in mind, That they ought to excel all others in
 purity of life, and should be examples to all other to live well and
 christianly.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore; Because the Goods of the Church are called the
 Goods of the Poor, and at these days nothing is less seen than the Poor to be
 sustained with the same; all Parsons, Vicars, Pensionaries, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries, and
 other Beneficed Men within the Deanery, not being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident upon their
 Benefices, which may dispend yearly 20 <hi>l.</hi> or above within this Deanry,
 or elsewhere, shall distribute hereafter yearly amongst <pb n="163" facs="tcp:104314:300"/>
 their poor Parishioners, or other Inhabitants there, in the presence of the
 Church-Wardens, or some other honest Men of the Parish, the fortieth part of
 the Fruits and Revenues of the said Benefices: lest they be worthily noted of
 Ingratitude; which reserving so many parts to themselves, cannot vouchsafe to
 impart the fortieth portion thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the poor People of that Parish,
 that is so fruitful and profitable unto them.</p>
                  <p>And to the intent that Learned Men may hereafter spring the

                  <p>MY Lord, after hearty Commendations,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cott.</hi> Libr. <hi>Cleop.</hi> E. 4.</note> I cannot but
 both much marvel that you whom I have taken as mine trusty Friend, should judg
 me, as I perceive by your Letters you do, and also be glad that ye so frankly
 utter your Stomach to me. I would thank you for your plain writing and free
 monitions, saving that you seem fuller of suspition than it becometh a Prelate
 of your sort to be: and (to say that maketh me more sorry) much worse perswaded
 of me than I thought any of your Learning and Judgment could have been. I took
 a Matter out of your hands to mine, if upon con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iderations mine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice bind me to do so, what cause have ye to
 complain? if I had done this, either upon affection, or intending prejudice to
 your estimation, you might have expostulated with me; and yet if ye then had
 done it after a gentler sort, I should both sooner have amended that I did
 amiss, <pb n="164" facs="tcp:104314:301"/> and also have had better cause to judge your
 writing to me, to be of a friendly heart towards me. If ye be offended with my
 sharp Letters, how can your testy words (I had almost given them another Name)
 delight me? I required you to use no extremity in your Office, <hi>durus est
 hic sermo,</hi> ye call it; and when ye have done, ye begin again, even as tho
 all being said, all were still behind. If ye have used none extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, I am, I
 ensure you, as glad of it as I ought to be: And though ye do not, yet upon a
 complaint my Office bindeth me to succour him that saith he is over-matched,
 and is compelled to sustain wrong. I was thus informed, and by Persons to whom
 I gave more credit than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do hereafter, if they have abused me, as
 ye would make me believe they have. They thus complaining, could I do less than
 grant unto them such Remedies as the King's Highness and his Laws give
 indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently to all his Subjects? Might I not also somewhat gather, that ye
 proceeded the sorer against the Reader, <hi>Roger London,</hi> when I had seen
 how much you desired the preferment of your Servant to that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue? My Lord,
 you had shewed your self of much more patience, I will not say of much more
 prudence, if ye had contented your self with their lawful Appeal, and my lawful
 Injunctions; and rather have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten somewhat fully to instruct us in this
 Matter, than thus to desire to conquer me by shrewd words, to vanquish me by
 sharp threp of Scripture, which as I know to use travel, so I trust to God as
 great a Clerk as ye be, is done already. Thus out of their place, it becometh
 me not, neither yet I am wont to vaunt my self of well-doing, I know who
 worketh all that is well wrought by me; and whereas he is the whole Doer, I
 intend not to offer him this wrong, to labour, and I to take the thanks; yet as
 I do not cease to give thanks, that that it hath pleased his Goodness to use me
 as an Instrument, and to work somewhat by me, so I trust I am as ready to serve
 him in my Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to my little power, as ye are prest to write worse of me
 than ye ought to think. My Prayer is, That God give me no longer life, than I
 shall be glad to use mine Office <hi>in aedificationem,</hi> and not <hi>in
 destructio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> as ye bear me in hand I do. God, ye say, will judg such
 using of Authority, meaning flatly, that I do abuse such Power as hath pleased
 God and the King's Highness to set me in; God, I say, will judg such Judges as
 yeare, and charge also such thoughts as ye misuse: ye do not so well as I would
 ye should do, if ye so think of me as your Letters make me think ye do. The
 Crime that ye charge me withal, is greater than I may or ought to bear,
 untruer, I trust, than they that would fainest, shall be able to prove. It is a
 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>trange thing, you say, that I
 neither would write, nor send you word by mouth, what ye should do with the
 Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Monks of <hi>Abington</hi>; and that the Abbot of <hi>Redding</hi>
 could get streight-way my Letters to inhibit your just doings: That was not my
 mind which I wrote, I did not intend to lett your just doings, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to
 require you to do justly; neither I was swift in granting my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to him,
 albeit I am much readier to help him that complains of wrong, than prest to
 further on him that desireth punishment of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whom I am not sure hath
 offended. I made you no answer, a strange thing! my Lord, I thought ye had
 better known my Business, than for such a Matter to esteem me not your Friend;
 you might have better judged that I was too much cumbred with other Affairs,
 that those which <pb n="165" facs="tcp:104314:301"/> sued for the Abbot, could better espy
 their time than you could. Some Man will think it rather utter displeasure
 conceived before, than that ye have any urgent occasion here to misjudg my mind
 towards you. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Manor you must use your Priviledges as things
 lent unto you, so long as ye shall occupy them well, that is, according to the
 mind and pleasure of them that gave you them. I took neither the Monk's Cause,
 nor any other, into my hands, to be a bearer of any such whom their upright
 dealings is not able to bear. No, you know I think, that I love such readers of
 Scripture as little as ye do: would God Men of your sort were as diligent to
 see that in all their Diocesses good were made, as I am glad to remove things
 when I know them; if ye had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken even then but half the pains to send up such
 things against him as ye now send, neither you should have had cause, no nor
 occasion thus easily to divine of my good or evil-will towards you, nor I have
 been cumbred with this answer. My Lord, I pray you, while I am your Friend,
 take me to be so; for if I were not, or if I knew any cause why I ought not, I
 would not be afraid to show you what had alienated my mind from you; so you
 should well perceive that my displeasure should last no longer than there were
 cause. I pass over your <hi>Nemo lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur nisi a seipso,</hi> I pray with you
 this first part, <hi>Our Lord have pity upon me</hi>; the other part is not in
 my Prayers, <hi>That God should turn my heart,</hi> for he is my Judg, I may
 err in my doings for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but I willingly bear no misdoers, I
 willingly hurt none whom honesty and the King's Laws do not refuse. Undo not
 you your self, I intend nothing less than to work you any displeasure. If
 hitherto I have shewed you any pleasure, I am glad of it: I showed it to your
 Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and not to you; if they tarry with you, my good-will cannot depart
 from you, except your Prayer be heard, that is, <hi>My Heart be turned.</hi> I
 assure you I am right-glad ye are in the place ye are in, and will do what
 shall lie in me to aid you in your Office, to maintain your Reputation, to give
 you credit among your Flock, and elsewhere; as long as I shall see you faithful
 to your Duty, according to your Calling. I will not become your good Lord, as
 your desire is, I am and have been your Friend, and take you to be mine; cast
 out vain suspition, let rash Judgment rule Men of less wit and discretion;
 wilfulness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh all Men better than a Bishop, which should always teach us
 to lack gladly our own Will, because you may not have your own Will. Here is
 <hi>Christus paup. facit &amp; ditat, cum Dominus dedit &amp; Dominus
 abstu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit,</hi> to what purpose? <hi>Sit nomen Domini benedictum,</hi> can
 never lack his place, it becometh alwise in season; or else as great a Divine
 as ye are, I would say, it were not the best Placed here, except you wist
 better, you had rather lose all than any part of your will. I pray you teach
 Patience better in your Deeds, or else speak as little of it as ye can. My
 Lord, you might have provoked an other in my place, that would have used less
 patience with you, finding so little in you; but I can take your Writings, and
 this Heat off your Stomach, even as well as I can, I trust, beware of
 Flatterers. As for the Abbot of <hi>Redding,</hi> and his Monk, if I find them
 as ye say they are, I will order them as I shall think good; ye shall do well
 to do your Duty, if you so do, ye have no cause to mistrust my Friendship; if
 ye do not, I must tell it you, and that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what after the plainest sort, To
 take a Cause out of your hands into <pb n="166" facs="tcp:104314:302"/> mine, I do but mine
 Office, you meddle further than your Office will bear you, thus roughly to
 handle me for using of mine. If ye do so no more, I let pass all that is past,
 and offer you such kindness as ye shall lawfully desire at my hands. Thus fare
 you well.</p>

 of the Word of God, chosen and sent for that intent, are the Messengers of
 Christ, to teach the Truth of his Gospel, and to loose and bind sin,
 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Christ was the Messenger of his Father. The words also of
 St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 20<hi>th</hi> Chap. of the <hi>Acts; Attendite vobis

 Ecclesiam Dei,</hi> were spoken to the Bishops and Priests, to be diligent
 Pastors of the People, both to teach them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and also to be
 circumspect that false Preachers should not seduce the People, as followeth
 immediately after in the same place. Other places of Scripture declare the
 highness and excellency of Christian Princes Authority and Power; the which of
 a truth is most high, for he hath power and charge generally over all, as well
 Bishops, as Priests, as other. The Bishops and Priests have charge of Souls
 within their own Cures, power to minister Sacraments, and to teach the Word of
 God; to the which Word of God Christian Princes knowledg themselves subject;
 and in case the Bishops be negligent, it is the Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Office to

 Supream Head, under Christ, of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I
 <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> Privy Seal, and Vice-gerent to the
 King's said Highness, for all his Jurisdiction Ecclesiastical within this
 Realm, do, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the true honour of Almighty God, encrease of
 Vertue, and discharge of the King's Majesty, give and exhibit unto you these
 Injunctions following, to be kept, observed, and fulfilled, upon the pains
 hereafter declared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First</hi>; That ye shall truly observe and keep all and
 singular the King's Highness Injunctions, given unto you heretofore in my Name,
 by his Graces Authority; not only upon the pains therein expressed, but also in
 your default after this second monition continued, upon further punishment to
 be straitly extended towards you by the King's Highness Arbitriment, or his
 Vice-gerent aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That ye shall provide on this side the Feast of
 next coming, one Book of the whole Bible of the largest Volume in English, and
 the same set up in some convenient place within the said Church that ye have
 Cure of, whereas your Parishioners may most commodiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly resort to the same
 and read it; the charge of which Book shall be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably born between you the
 Parson and the Parishioners aforesaid, that is to say, the one half by you, and
 the other half by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That you shall discourage no Man privily or
 apertly from the reading or hearing of the said Bible, but shall expresly
 provoke, stir, and exhort every Person to read the same, as that which is the
 very lively Word of God, that every Christian Man is bound to embrace, believe,
 and follow, if he look to be saved; admonishing them never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless to avoid all
 contention, altercation therein, and to use an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest sobriety in the
 inquisition of the true sense of the same, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the explication of the
 obscure places to Men of higher judgment in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That ye shall every <hi>Sunday</hi> and
 Holy-day through the Year, openly and plainly recite to your Parishioners,
 twice or thrice together, or oftner, if need require, one particle or sentence
 of the <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> or <hi>Creed,</hi> in English, to the intent they
 may learn the same by Heart; And so from day to day, to give them one little
 lesson or sentence of the same, till they have learned the whole <hi>Pater
 Noster</hi> and <hi>Creed,</hi> in English, by rote. And as they be taught
 every sentence of the same by rote, ye shall expound and declare the
 understanding of the same unto them, exhorting all Parents and Housholders to
 teach their Children and Servants the same, as they are bound in Conscience to
 do. And that done, ye shall declare unto them the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi>
 one by <pb n="179" facs="tcp:104314:308"/> one, every Sunday and Holy-day, till they be
 likewise perfect in the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That ye shall in Confessions every
 <hi>Lent</hi> examine every Person that cometh to Confession unto you, whether
 they can recite the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Faith, and the <hi>Pater Noster</hi> in
 English, and hear them say the same particularly; wherein if they be not
 perfect, ye shall declare to the same, That every Christian Person ought to
 know the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they should receive the blessed Sacrament of the Altar;
 and monish them to learn the same more perfectly by the next year following, or
 else, like-as they ought not to presume to come to God's Board without perfect
 knowledg of the same, and if they do, it is to the great peril of their Souls;
 so ye shall declare unto them, that ye look for other Injunctions from the
 King's Highness by that time, to stay and repel all such from God's Board as
 shall be found ignorant in the Premisses; whereof ye do thus admonish them, to
 the intent they should both es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the peril of their Souls, and also the
 worldly rebuke that they might incur after by the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That ye shall make, or cause to be made, in the
 said Church, and every other Cure ye have, one Sermon every quarter of the year
 at least, wherein ye shall purely and sincerely declare the very Gospel of
 Christ, and in the same exhort your Hearers to the Works of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Mercy,
 and Faith, especially prescribed and commanded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not to repose
 their trust or affiance in any other Works devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Mens fantasies beside
 Scripture; as in wandring to Pilgrimages, offering of Mony, Candels, or Tapers,
 to Images, or Reliques; or kissing or licking the same over, saying over a
 number of Beads, not understanded or minded on, or in such-like superstition;
 for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, ye not only have no promise of reward in Scripture, but
 contrariwise great threats and maledictions of God, as things tending to
 Idolatry and Superstition, which of all other Offences God Almighty doth most
 detest and abhor, for that the same diminisheth most his honour and glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That such feigned Images as ye know in any of
 your Cures to be so abused with Pilgrimages or Offerings of any thing made
 thereunto, ye shall, for avoiding of that most detestable offence of Idolatry,
 forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with take down, and without delay; and shall suffer from henceforth no
 Candles, Tapers, or Images of Wax to be set afore any Image or Picture, but
 only the Light that commonly goeth a-cross the Church by the Rood-loft, the
 Light before the Sacrament of the Altar, and the Light about the Sepulchre;
 which for the adorning of the Church, and Divine Service, ye shall suffer to
 remain: still admonishing your Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that Images serve for none other
 purpose, but as to be Books of unlearned Men, that ken no Letters, whereby they
 might be otherwise admonished of the lives and conversation of them that the
 said Images do represent; which Images if they abuse, for any other intent than
 for such remembrances, they commit Idolatry in the same, to the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
 of their Souls: And therefore the King's Highness graciously ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the weal
 of his Subjects Souls, hath in part already, and more will 
 <pb n="180" facs="tcp:104314:309"/> hereafter, travail for the abolishing of such Images as
 might be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of so great an offence to God, and so great a danger to
 the Souls of his loving Subjects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That all in such Benefices, or Cures, as ye
 have, whereupon ye be not your self Resident, ye shall appoint such Curats in
 your stead, as can both by their hability, and also promptly, execute these
 Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and do their duty, otherwise that ye are bounden in every behalf
 accordingly, and may profit them, no less with good Examples of living, than
 with declaration of the Word of God, or else their lack and defaults shall be
 imputed unto you, who shall straitly answer for the same if they do
 otherwise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That ye shall admit no Man to preach within any
 your Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices or Cures, but such as shall appear unto you to be sufficiently
 li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed thereunto by the King's Highness, or his Grace's Authority, by the
 Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or the Bishop of this Diocess; and such as
 shall be so licensed, ye shall gladly receive to declare the Word of God,
 without any resistance or contradiction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; If ye have heretofore declared to your
 Parishioners any thing to the extolling or setting forth of Pilgrimages,
 feigned Reliques, or Images, or any such superstitions, that you shall now
 openly afore the same recant and reprove the same, shewing them (as the truth
 is) that ye did the same upon no ground of Scripture, but as one led and
 sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a common Error and Abuse crept into the Church, through the
 sufferance and avarice of such as felt profit by the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; If ye do or shall know any Man within your
 Parish, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that is a Letter of the Word of God to be read in
 English, or sincerely preached, or of the execution of these Injunctions; or a
 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s pretensed Power, now by the Laws of
 this Realm justly rejected and extirped; ye shall detect and present the same
 to the King's Highness, or his honourable Council, or to his Vice-gerent
 aforesaid, or the Justice of Peace next adjoining.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That you, and every Parson, Vicar, or Curat
 within this Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, shall for every Church keep one Book or Register, wherein
 he shall write the day and year of every Wedding, Christening, and Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
 made within your Parish for your time, and so every Man succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you
 likewise; and also there insert every Person's Name that shall be so wedded,
 christened, and buried; and for the safe keeping of the same Book, the Parish
 shall be bound to provide, of their common charges, one sure Coffer with two
 Locks and Keys, whereof the one to remain with you, and the other with the
 Wardens of every such Parish wherein the said Book shall be laid up; which Book
 ye shall every <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> take forth, and in the presence of the said
 Wardens, or one of them, write and record in the same, all the Weddings,
 Christenings, and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryings, made the whole week afore; and that done, to lay
 up the Book in the said Coffer, as afore: And for every time that the same
 shall be omitted, the Party that shall be in the fault thereof, shall forfeit
 to the said <pb n="181" facs="tcp:104314:309"/> Church 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> to be
 employed on the reparation of the said Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That ye shall every quarter of a year read
 these and the other former Injunctions, given unto you by the Authority of the
 King's Highness, openly and deliberately before all your Parishioners, to the
 intent that both you may be the better admonished of your duty, and your said
 Parishioners the more incited to ensue the same for their part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; Forasmuch as by a Law established, every Man is
 bound to pay the Tithes; no Man shall, by colour of duty, omitted by their
 Curats, detain their Tithes, and so redouble one wrong with another, or be his
 own Judg, but shall truly pay the same, as hath been accustomed, to their
 Parsons and Curats, without any restraint or diminution; and such lack or
 default as they can justly find in their Parsons and Curats to call for
 reformation thereof at their Ordinaries, and other Superiors hands, who, upon
 complaint, and due proof thereof, shall reform the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That no Person shall from henceforth alter or
 change the order and manner of any Fasting-day that is commanded and indicted
 by the Church, nor of any Prayer, or of Divine Service, otherwise than is
 specified in the said Injunctions, until such time as the same shall be so
 ordered and transported by the Kings Highness's Authority; The Eves of such
 Saints, whose Holy-days be abrog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ted be only excepted, which shall be declared henceforth to be no
 Fasting-days; excepted also the commemoration of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi>
 some-time Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which shall be clean omitted,
 and in the stead thereof, the Ferial Service used.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That the knolling of the Avies after Service,
 and certain other times, which hath been brought in and begun by the pretence
 of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s pardon, henceforth be left and omitted, lest
 the People do hereafter trust to have pardon for the saying of their Avies,
 between the said knolling, as they have done in times past.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; Where in times past Men have used in divers
 places in their Processions, to sing <hi>Ora pro nobis</hi> to so many Saints,
 that they had no time to sing the good Suffrages following, as <hi>Parce nobis
 Domine,</hi> and <hi>Libera nos Domine,</hi> it must be taught and preached,
 that better it were to omit <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> and to sing the other
 Suffrages.</p>
                  <p>All which and singular Injunctions I minister unto you and
 your Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, by the King's Highness Authority to me committed in this
 part, which I charge and command you by the same Authority to observe and keep
 upon pain of Deprivation, Sequestration of your Fruits, or such other coercion
 as to the King's Highness, or his Vice-gerent for the time being shall seem
 convenient.</p>

 herewith receive the King's Highness Letters addressed unto you, to put you in
 remembrance of his Highness travels, and your duty touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order to be taken
 for Preaching, to the intent the People may be taught the Truth, and yet not
 charged at the beginning with over-many Novelties; the publication whereof,
 unless the same be tempered and qualified with much wisdom, do rather breed
 Contention, Division, and contrariety in Opinion in the unlearned Multitude,
 than either edify, or remove from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and out of their hearts, such
 abuses as by the corrupt and unsavoury teaching of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
 and his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples have crept in the same. The effect of which Letters albeit I
 doubt not, but as well for the honesty of the Matter, as for your own
 discharge, ye will so consider and put in execution, as shall be to his Graces
 satisfaction in that behalf: Yet forasmuch as it hath pleased his Majesty to
 appoint and constitute me in the room and place of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and Principal
 Ministry, in all Matters that may touch any thing his Clergy, or their doings,
 I thought it also my part, for the exonera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Duty towards his
 Highness, and the rather to answer to his Graces Expectation, Opinion, and
 Trust conceived in me, and in that amongst other committed to my fidelity, to
 desire and pray you, in such substantial sort and manner, to travel in the
 execution of the Contents of his Graces said Letters; namely, for avoiding of
 Contrariety in preaching, of the pronunciation of Novelties, without wise and
 discreet qualification, and the repression of the temerity of those, that
 either privily, or apertly, directly or indirectly, would advance the
 pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Authority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; as I be not for my
 discharge enforced to complain further, and to declare what I have now written
 unto you for that purpose, and so to charge you with your own fault, and to
 devise such remedy for the same, as shall appertain: desiring your Lordship to
 accept my meaning herein, tending only to an honest, friendly, and Christian
 Reformation, for avoidage of further inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, and to think none
 unkindness, tho in this Matter, wherein it is almost more than time to speak, I
 write frankly, compelled and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereunto, both in respect of my private
 Duty, and otherwise, for my discharge; forasmuch as it pleaseth his Majesty to
 use me in the lieu of a Counsellour, whose Office is as an Eye to the Prince,
 to foresee, and in time to provide remedy for such Abuses, Enormities, and
 Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, as might else with a little sufferance engender more evil in
 Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Weal, than could be after recovered, with much labour, study,
 di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, <pb n="184" facs="tcp:104314:312"/> and travails. And thus most heartily fare

 and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Subjects, the Commons in this your most High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
 assembled; That where your most Royal Majesty, our Natural Sovereign Lord, is
 justly, lawfully, and really entituled to be our sole Supream Head and
 Governour, of this your Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and of the Dominions of the
 same; to whom, and to none other under God, the Kingly Direction, Order, and
 Governance, of your most loving and obedient Subjects, and People of this your
 Realm, only appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and belongeth. And the which your most loving and
 obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, your Highness prudently and quietly, without any manner of
 di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance, by a long time most graciously hath preserved, sustained, and
 defended: And your Highness, for the Quietness, Wealth, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of
 your said humble and obedient Subjects, hath made, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, divers and
 many most godly, vertuous, and wholsome Laws; and for due execution of the
 same, hath not desisted to travel in your own most Royal Person, to support and
 maintain, as well the Laws of Almighty God, as the Laws by your Highness made
 and ordained, by due and condign execution of the same Laws upon the
 Transgressors offending contrary to the same: And your Majesty hath always most
 ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously studied and laboured, by all ways, and all means, to and for the
 set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth thereof, in such wise as it might be most to the Honour, Glory,
 and Pleasure of Almighty God; and for the common accord and wealth of this your
 Realm, and other your Dominions: And for the true execution of the same, hath
 elected, chosen, and made divers, as well of your Nobles, as others, to be of
 your most honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as to the honour of a Noble Prince appertaineth.
 And where your Majesty hath had a special trust and confidence in your said
 most trusty Counsellors, that the same your Counsellors, and every of them, had
 minded and intended, and finally purposed to have followed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued your
 most Godly and Princely Purpose, as of truth the more num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hath most
 faithfully done; Yet nevertheless <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> now Earl of
 <hi>Essex,</hi> whom your Majesty took and received into your trusty Service,
 the same <hi>Thomas</hi> then being a Man of very base and low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and for
 singular favour, trust, and confidence, which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty bare and had in
 him, did not only erect and advance the same <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> unto the State of
 an Earl, and enriched him with many-fold Gifts, as well of Goods, as of Lands
 and Offices, but also him, the said <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> Earl of
 <hi>Essex,</hi> did erect and make one of your most trusty Counsellors, as well
 concerning your Grace's Supream Jurisdictions Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, as your most
 high secret Affairs Temporal. Nevertheless your Majesty now of late hath found,
 and tried, by a large number of Witnesses, being your faithful Subjects, and
 Personages of great Honour, <pb n="188" facs="tcp:104314:314"/> Worship, and Discretion, the
 said <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the
 singular trust and confidence which your Majesty had in him, to be the most
 false and corrupt Traitor, Deceiver, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor against your most Royal
 Person, and the Imperial Crown of this your Realm, that hath been known, seen,
 or heard of in all the time of your most noble Reign: Insomuch that it is
 manifestly proved and declared, by the Depositions of the Witnesses aforesaid,
 That the same <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> usurping upon
 your Kingly Estate, Power, Authority, and Office; without your Grace's
 Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Assent, hath taken upon him to set at liberty divers Persons,
 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convicted and attainted of Misprision of High Treason; and divers other
 being apprehended, and in Prison, for Suspection of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and over
 that, divers and many times, at sundry places, in this your Realm, for manifold
 Sums of Mony to him given, most traiterou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly hath taken upon him, by several
 Writings, to give and grant, as well unto Aliens, as to your Subjects, a great
 number of Licenses for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing and carrying of Mony, Corn, Grain, Beans,
 Beer, Leather, Tallow, Bells, Mettals, Horses, and other Commodities of this
 your Realm, contrary to your Highness's most Godly and Gracious Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
 made for the Common-Wealth of your People of this your Realm in that behalf,
 and in derogation of your Crown and Dignity. And the same <hi>Thomas
 Cromwell,</hi> elated, and full of pride, contrary to his most bounden Duty, of
 his own Authority and Power, not regarding your Majesty Royal; And further,
 taking upon him your Power, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord, in that behalf, divers and many
 times most traiterously hath constituted, deputed, and assigned, many singular
 Persons of your Subjects to be Commissioners in many your great, urgent, and
 weighty Causes and Affairs, executed and done in this your Realm, without the
 assent, knowledg, or consent of your Highness. And further also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a
 Person of as poor and low degree, as few be within this your Realm; pretending
 to have so great a stroak about you, our, and his natural Sovereign Liege Lord,
 that he letted not to say publickly, and declare, That he was sure of you;
 which is detestable, and to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred amongst all good Subjects in any
 Christian Realm, that any Subject should enterprize or take upon him so to
 speak of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Liege Lord and King. And also of his own Authority and
 Power, without your Highness's consent, hath made, and granted, as well to
 Strangers as to your own Subjects, divers and many Pass-ports, to pass over the
 Seas, with Horses, and great Sums of Mony, without any search. And over that,
 most Gracious Soveraign Lord, amongst divers other his Treasons, Deceits, and
 Falshoods, the said <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> being a
 detestable Heretick, and being in himself utterly disposed to sett and sow
 common Sedition and Variance among your true and loving Subjects, hath secretly
 set forth and dispersed into all Shires, and other Territories of this your
 Realm, and other your Dominions, great numbers of false Erroneous Books,
 whereof many were printed and made beyond the Seas, and divers other within
 this Realm, comprising and declaring, amongst many other Evils and Errors,
 manifest Matters to induce and lead your Subjects to diffidence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
 of the true and sincere Faith and Belief, which Christian Religion bindeth all
 Christian People to have, in the most Holy and Blessed <pb n="189" facs="tcp:104314:314"/>
 Sacrament of the Altar, and other Articles of Christian Religion, most
 graciously declared by your Majesty, by Authority of Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
 certain Matters comprised in some of the said Books, hath caused to be
 translated into our maternal and English Tongue: And upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port made unto him
 by the Translator thereof, that the Matter so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated hath expresly been
 against the said most Blessed and Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Yet the same <hi>Thomas
 Cromwell,</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> after he had read the same Translation,
 most heretically hath affirmed the same material Heresie so translated, to be
 good; and further hath said, that he found no fault therein; and over that,
 hath openly and obstinately holden Opinion, and said, That it was as lawful for
 every Christian Man to be a Minister of the said Sacrament, as well as a
 Priest. And where also your most Royal Majesty, being a Prince of Vertue,
 Learning, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, of singular Confidence and Trust, did constitute and
 make the same <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> your Highness's
 Vicegerent within this your Realm of <hi>England</hi>; and by the same, gave
 unto him Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power, not only to redress and reform all, and all
 manner of Errors, and Erroneous Opinions, insurging and growing among your
 loving and obedient Subjects of this your Realm, and of the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the
 same, but also to order and direct all Ecclesiastical and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Causes
 within your said Realm and Dominions; the said <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> Earl
 of <hi>Essex,</hi> not regarding his Duty to Almighty God, and to your
 Highness, under the Seal of your Vicegerent, hath, without your Grace's assent
 or knowledg, licensed and authorized divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, detected and suspected of
 Heresies, openly to teach and preach amongst your most loving and obedient
 Subjects, within this your Realm of <hi>England.</hi> And under the pretence
 and colour of the said great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and Cures, which your Majesty hath
 committed unto him in the Premisses, hath not only, of his corrupt and damnable
 Will and Mind, actually, at some time, by his own Deed and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at
 many other times by his Letters, expresly written to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers worshipful
 Persons, being Sheriffs, in sundry Shires of this your Realm, falsly suggesting
 thereby your Grace's Pleasure so to have been, caused to be set at large many
 false Hereticks, some being there indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and some other being thereof
 apprehended, and in ward: and commonly, upon complaints made by credible
 Persons unto the said <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> of
 great and most detestable Heresies committed and sprung in many places of this
 your Realm, with decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Specialities of the same Heresies, and the
 Names of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders therein, the same <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> Earl of
 <hi>Essex,</hi> by his crafty and subtil means and inventions, hath not only
 defended the same Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks from Punishment and Reformation; but being a
 fautor, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer, and supporter of Hereticks, divers times hath terribly
 rebuked divers of the said credible Persons being their Accusers, and some
 others of them hath persecuted and vexed by Imprisonment and otherwise. So that
 thereby many of your Grace's true and loving Subjects have been in much dread
 and fear, to detect or accuse such detestable known Hereticks; the
 particularities and specialities of which said abominable Heresies, Errors, and
 Offences, committed and done by the said <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Cromwell,</hi> being
 over-tedious, long, and of too great number here to be expressed, declared, or
 written. And to the intent to have those <pb n="190" facs="tcp:104314:315"/> damnable Errors
 and Heresies, to be inculcated, impressed, and infixed in the Hearts of your
 Subjects, as well contrary to God's Laws, as to your Laws and Ordinances. Most
 Gracious Soveraign Lord, the same <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> Earl of
 <hi>Essex,</hi> hath allured and drawn unto him by Retainours, many of your
 Subjects sunderly inhabiting in every of your said Shires and territories, as
 well erroneously perswading and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to them the Contents of the false
 erroneous Books, above-written, to be good, true, and best standing with the
 most Holy Word and Pleasure of God; as other his false and heretical Opinions
 and Errors; whereby, and by his Confederacies therein, he hath caused ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of
 your faithful Subjects to be greatly infected with Heresies, and other Errors,
 contrary to the right Laws and Pleasure of Almighty God. And the same
 <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> by the false and traiterous
 means above-written, supposing himself to be fully able, by force and strength,
 to maintain and defend his said abominable Treasons, Heresies, and Errors, not
 regarding his most bounden Duty to Almighty God, and his Laws, nor the natural
 Duty of Allegiance to your Majesty, in the last day of <hi>March,</hi> in the
 30 year of our most gracious Reign, in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish of <hi>St. Peter the
 Poor,</hi> within your City of <hi>London,</hi> upon demonstration and
 declaration then &amp; there made unto him, that there were certain new
 Preachers, as <hi>Robert Barnes</hi> Clerk, and other, whereof part been now
 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> for preaching and teaching
 of leud Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against your Highness's Proclamations; the same
 <hi>Thomas</hi> affirming the same preaching to be good, most detestably,
 arrogantly, erroneously, wilfully, maliciously, and traiterously, expresly
 against your Laws and Statutes, then and there did not lett to declare, and
 say, these most traiterous and detestable words ensuing, amongst other words of
 like matter and effect; that is to say, That <hi>if the King would turn from
 it, yet I would not turn; And if the King did turn, and all his People, I would
 fight in the Field in mine own Person, with my Sword in my hand, against him
 and all others</hi>; and then, and there, most traiterously pulled out his
 Dagger, and held it on high, saying these words, <hi>Or else this Dagger thrust
 me to the heart, if I would not die in that Quarrel against them all: And I
 trust, if I live one year or two, it shall not lie in the King's Power to
 resist or lett it if he would.</hi> And further, then and there swearing by a
 great Oath, traiterously affirmed the same his traiterous saying and
 pronunciation of words, saying, <hi>I will do so indeed,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending up his
 Arm, as though he had had a Sword in his Hand; to the most perrilous, grievous,
 and wicked Example of all other your loving, faithful, and obedient Subjects in
 this your Realm, and to the peril of your most Royal Person. And moreover, our
 most Gracious Soveraign Lord, the said <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> Earl of
 <hi>Essex,</hi> hath acquired and obtained into his possession, by Oppression,
 Bribery, Extort, Power, and false Promises made by him, to your Subjects of
 your Realm, innumerable Sums of Mony and Treasure; and being so enriched, hath
 had your Nobles of your Realm in great disdain, derision, and detestation, as
 by express words by him most opprobriously spoken hath appeared. And being put
 in remembrance of others, of his estate, which your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hath called him
 unto, offending in like Treasons, the last day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the 31
 year of your most noble Reign, at the Parish of <hi>St. Martin in the
 Field,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> most arrogantly, 
 <pb n="191" facs="tcp:104314:315"/> willingly, maliciously, and traiterously, said,
 published, and declared, That <hi>if the Lords would handle him so, that he
 would give them such a Break-fast as never was made in</hi> England, <hi>and
 that the proudest of them should know</hi>; to the great peril and danger, as
 well of your Majesty, as of your Heirs and Successors: For the which his most
 detestable and abominable Heresies and Treasons, and many other his like
 Offences and Treasons, over-long here to be rehearsed and declared. Be it

 the same to be advertised, That the last time it pleased your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Goodness
 to send unto me the Right Honourable Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, the Right Honourable
 Duke of <hi>Norff.</hi> and the Lord Admiral, to examine, and also to declare
 unto me divers things from your Majesty; among the which, one special thing
 they moved, and thereupon they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me, as I would answer before God at the
 dreadful day of Judgment, and also upon the extreme danger and damnation of my
 Soul and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to say what I knew in the Marriage, and concerning the
 Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, between your Highness and the Queen. To the which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered as I
 knew, declaring unto them the Particulars, as nigh as I then could call to
 remembrance. Which when they had heard, they, in your Majesty's Name, and upon
 like charge as they had given me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, commanded me to write to your
 Highness the truth, as much as I knew in that Matter; which now I do, and the
 very truth, as God shall save me, to the uttermost of my knowledg. First; After
 your Majesty heard of the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Cleves</hi> arrival at
 <hi>Dover,</hi> and that her Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were appointed toward
 <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and that she should be at <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> on New-years
 Even at night, your Highness declared to me, that you would privily visit her
 at <hi>Rochester,</hi> upon New-years-day, adding these words, <hi>To nourish
 love</hi>; which accordingly your Grace did upon New-years-day, as is
 above-said. And the next day, being <hi>Friday,</hi> your Grace returned to
 <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where I spake with your Grace, and demanded of your
 Majesty, How ye liked the Lady <hi>Ann:</hi> your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness answered, as me
 thought, heavily, and not pleasantly, <hi>Nothing so well as she was spoken
 of</hi>; saying further, <hi>That if your Highness had known as much before as
 ye then knew, she should not have come within this Realm</hi>; saying, as by
 the way of lamentation, <hi>What Remedy?</hi> Unto the which I answered and
 said, I know none but was very sorry therefore; and so God knoweth I was, for I
 thought it a hard beginning. The next day after the receipt of the said Lady,
 and her entry made unto <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and after your Highness had brought
 her to her Chamber, I then waited upon your Highness into your Privy-Chamber;
 and being there, your Grace called me unto you, saying to me these words, or
 the like, <hi>My Lord, is it not as I told you? say what they will, she is
 nothing so fair as she hath been reported; howbeit she is well and seemly.</hi>
 Whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and said, By my Faith, Sir, ye say truth; adding
 thereunto, that I thought she had a Queenly manner; and nevertheless was sorry
 that your Grace was no better content: And thereupon your Grace commanded me to
 call together your Council, which were these by name; The Arch-Bishop of
 <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <pb n="194" facs="tcp:104314:317"/>
                     <hi>Suffolk,</hi> my Lord Admiral, and my Lord of <hi>Duresme,</hi> and my
 self, to commune of these Matters, and to know what Commissions the Agents of
 <hi>Cleves</hi> had brought, as well touching the performance of the Covenants
 sent before from hence to Dr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> to have been concluded in
 <hi>Cleves,</hi> as also in the declaration how the Matters stood for the
 Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Marriage, between the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Son, and the
 said Lady <hi>Ann.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Olisleger</hi> and <hi>Hogeston</hi> were
 called, and the Matters purposed; whereby it plainly appeared, that they were
 much astonished and abashed, and desired that they might make answer in the
 next morning, which was <hi>Sunday:</hi> And upon the <hi>Sunday</hi> in the
 morning your said Counsellors and they met together early, and there eft-soons
 was proposed unto them, as well touching the Commission for the performance of
 the Treaty and Articles sent to Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> as also touching the
 Contracts and Covenants of Marriage between the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Son,
 and the Lady <hi>Ann,</hi> and what terms they stood in. To which things so
 proposed, they answered as Men much perplexed, That as touching Commission,
 they had none to treat concerning the Articles sent to Mr. <hi>Wotton.</hi> And
 as to the Contract and Covenants of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age they could say nothing, but that
 a Revocation was made, and that they were but Spousals. And finally, after much
 reasoning, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themselves to remain Prisoners, until such time as
 they should have sent unto them from <hi>Cleves</hi> the first Articles
 ratified under the Duke their Masters Sign and Seal, and also the Copy of the
 Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation made between the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Son and the Lady
 <hi>Ann.</hi> Upon the which Answers, I was sent to your Highness by my Lords
 of your Council, to declare to your Highness their Answer; and came to you, by
 the Privy Way, into your Privy Chamber, and declared unto the same all the
 Circumstances, wherewith your Grace was very much displeased, saying, <hi>I am
 not well handled</hi>; insomuch that I might well perceive that your Highness
 was fully determined not to have gone through with the Marriage at that time,
 saying unto me these words, or the like in effect; <hi>That if it were not that
 she is come so far unto my Realm, and the great Preparations that my States and
 People have made for her, and for fear of making a ruffel in the World; that
 is, to mean to drive her Brother into the hands of the Emperor and the French
 King's hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now together, I would never have ne married her.</hi> So
 that I might well perceive your Grace was neither content with the Person, ne
 yet with the Proceedings of the Agents; And at after-dinner, the said
 <hi>Sunday,</hi> your Grace sent for all your said Counsellors in, repeating
 how your Highness was handled, as well touching the said Articles, as also the
 said Matter of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Son. It might, and I doubt not,
 did appear unto them how loth your Highness was to have married at that time.
 And thereupon, and upon the Considerations aforesaid, your Grace thought that
 it should be well done that she should make a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station before your said
 Counsellors and Notaries to be present, that she was free from all Contracts;
 which was done accordingly. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I repairing to your Highness,
 declared how that she had made her Protestation. Whereunto your Grace answered
 in effect these words, or much like; <hi>Is there none other Remedy, but that I
 must needs, against my Will, put my Neck in the Yoke</hi>; and so departed,
 leaving your Highness in a study or pensiveness. And yet your Grace determined
 the next <pb n="195" facs="tcp:104314:317"/> morning to go through; and in the morning,
 which was <hi>Monday,</hi> your Majesty preparing your self towards the
 Ceremonies; There was one Question, Who should lead to the Church? And it was
 appointed that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> deceased, and an Earl that came with
 her, should lead her to the Church. And thereupon one came to your Highness,
 and said to you, That the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was not come; whereupon your
 Grace appointed me to be one that should lead her: And so I went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her
 Chamber, to the intent to have done your Commandment; and shortly after I came
 into her Chamber, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was come: Whereupon I repaired
 back again into your Graces Privy Chamber, and shewed your Highness how he was
 come; and thereupon your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty advanced towards the Gallery out of your
 Privy Chamber; and your Grace being in and about the midst of your Chamber of
 Presence, called me unto you, saying these words, or the like in sentence;
 <hi>My Lord, if it were not to satisfy the World, and my Realm, I would not do
 that I must do this day for none earthly thing</hi>; and therewith one brought
 your Grace Word that she was coming; and thereupon your Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired into
 the Gallery towards the Closet, and there paused for her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being nothing
 content that she so long tarried as I judged then. And so consequently she
 came, and your Grace afterward proceeded to the Ceremonies; and they being
 finished, travelled the day as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the night after the custom.
 And in the morning, on <hi>Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> I repairing to your Majesty into your
 Privy-Chamber, finding your Grace not so pleasant as I trusted to have done, I
 was so bold to ask your Grace how you liked the Queen? Whereunto your Grace
 soberly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, saying, <hi>That I was not all Men, surely, as ye know, I
 liked her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not well, but now I like her much worse; for,</hi> quoth your
 Highness, <hi>I have felt her Belly, and her Breasts, and thereby, as I can
 judg, she should be no Maid; which strook me so to the Heart when I felt them,
 that I had neither will nor courage to proceed any further in other
 Matters</hi>; saying, <hi>I have left her as good a Maid as I found her:</hi>
 Which me thought then ye spake displeasantly, which made me very sorry to hear;
 Your Highness also after <hi>Candlemass,</hi> and before <hi>Showstie,</hi>
 once or twice said, That <hi>ye were in the same case with her as ye were
 afore, and that your Heart could never consent to meddle with her
 carnally.</hi> Notwithstanding your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness alledged, that ye for the most
 part used to lay nightly, or every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond night by her, and yet your Majesty
 ever said, <hi>That she was as good a Maid for you, as ever her Mother bare
 her, for any thing ye had ministred to her.</hi> Your Highness shewed to me
 also in <hi>Lent</hi> last passed, at such time as your Grace had some
 communication with her of my Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> how that she began to wax
 stubborn and willful, ever lamenting your fate, and ever verifying that ye
 never had any carnal knowledg with her: And also after <hi>Easter,</hi> your
 Grace likewise, at divers times, and in the <hi>Whitsun</hi>-week, in your
 Grace's Privy-Chamber at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly lamented your fate,
 and that your greatest grief was, That <hi>ye should surely never have any more
 Children for the comfort of this Realm, if ye should so continue</hi>; assuring
 me, <hi>that before God ye thought she was never your lawful Wife.</hi> At
 which time your Grace knoweth what answer I made; which was, that I would for
 my part do my utmost to comfort and deliver your Grace of your Afflictions; and
 how sorry I was both to see and hear your Grace God knoweth. Your Grace divers
 times <pb n="196" facs="tcp:104314:318"/> sithen <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> ever alleadging one
 thing, and also saying, That <hi>ye had as much to do to move the consent of
 your Heart and Mind as ever did Man, and that you took God to witness; but
 ever,</hi> you said, <hi>the Obstacle could never out of your Mind.</hi> And,
 Gracious Prince, after that you had first seen her at <hi>Rochester,</hi> I
 never thought in my heart that ye were or would be contented with that
 Marriage. And, Sir, I know now in what case I stand, in which is only the Mercy
 of God and your Grace; if I have not, to the uttermost of my remembrance, said
 the Truth, and the whole Truth in this Matter, God never help me. I am sure
 there is, as I think, no Man in this your Realm that knew more in this than I
 did, your Highness only excepted. And I am sure, my Lord Admiral calling to his
 remembrance, can shew your Highness, and be my Witness what I said unto him
 after your Grace came from <hi>Rochester,</hi> yea, and after your Grace's
 Marriage: And also now of late, sithence <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> and I doubt not
 but many and divers of my Lords of your Council, both before your Marriage and
 sithence, have right-well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that your Majesty hath not been well
 pleased with your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. And as I shall answer to God, I never thought your
 Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, after you had once seen her at <hi>Rochester.</hi> And this is
 all that I know, most gracious and most merciful Sovereign Lord, beseeching
 Almighty God, who ever hath in all your Causes counselled, preserved, opened,
 maintained, relieved, and defended your Highness; So he will now vouchsafe to
 counsel you, preserve you, maintain you, reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy you, relieve and defend you,
 as may be most to your Honour, with Prosperity, Health, and Comfort of your
 Hearts desire. For the which, and for the long Life, and prosperous Reign of
 your most Royal Majesty, I shall, during my Life, and whiles I am here, pray to
 Almighty God, that he of his most abundant Goodness will help, aid, and comfort
 you, after your continuance of <hi>Nestor</hi>'s Years: that that most noble
 Imp, the Princes Grace, your most dear Son, may succeed you to Reign long,
 prosperously, and feliciously to God's pleasure: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching most humbly your
 Grace to pardon this my rude writing, and to consider that I a most woful
 Prisoner, ready to take the Death, when it shall please God and your Majesty;
 and yet the frail flesh inciteth me continually to call to your Grace for Mercy
 and Grace for mine Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and thus Christ save, preserve, and keep you.</p>

 verity intended, upon none sinister affection, nor yet upon none hatred nor
 displeasure, and herein I take God to witness. Now to the Matter I say and
 affirm; That when the first communication was had with me for the Marriage of
 the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Cleves,</hi> I was glad to hearken to it, trusting
 to have some assured Friend by it; I much doubting that time, both the Emperor,
 <hi>France,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; and also because I heard so
 much, both of her excellent Beauty and vertuous Conditions. But when I saw her
 at <hi>Rochester,</hi> the first time that ever I saw her, it rejoiced my heart
 that I had kept me free from making any Pact or Bond before with her till I saw
 her my self; for then I adsure you I liked her so ill, and so far contrary to
 that she was praised, that I was woe that ever she came into <hi>England</hi>;
 and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with my self, that if it were possible to find means to break
 off, I would never enter Yoke with her. Of which misliking, both the great
 Master, the Admiral that now is, and the Master of the Horses, can and will
 here record. Then after my repair to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I
 think, and doubt not, but that the Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> well examined, can,
 and will, or hath declared what I then said to him in that case; not doubting,
 but since he is a Person which knoweth himself condemned to die by Act of
 Parliament, will not damn his Soul, but truly declare the Truth, not only at
 that time spoken by me, but also continually till the day of Marriage; and also
 many times after, whereby my lack of consent, I doubt not, doth or shall well
 appear; And also lack enough of the Will and Power to consummate the same;
 wherein both he, my Physicians, the Lord Privy Seal that now is,
 <hi>Hennage</hi> and <hi>Denny</hi> can, and I doubt not will testify according
 to truth, which is, That I never for love to the Woman consented to marry; nor
 yet if she brought Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-head with her, took any from her by true Carnal
 Copulation. This is my brief, true, and perfect Declaration.</p>

 for want thereof ye should be deceived by vain Reports, I write these present
 Letters unto you, by which ye shall understand, That being advertised how the
 Nobles and Commons of this Realm desired the King's Highness here to commit the
 examination of the Matter of Marriage, between me and his Majesty, to the
 determination of the Clergy: I did the more willingly consent thereunto, and
 since the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination made, have also allowed, approved, and agreed unto the
 same, wherein I have more respect, as becometh me, to Truth and good Pleasure,
 than any worldly Affection that might move me to the contrary. I account God
 pleased with that is done, and know my self to have suffered no wrong or
 injury; but being my Body preserved in the integrity which I brought into this
 Realm, and I truly discharged from all band of Consent, I find the King's
 Highness, whom I cannot justly have as my Husband, to be nevertheless as a most
 kind, loving, and friendly Father and Brother, and to use me as honourably, and
 with as much humanity and liberality as you, I my self, or any of our Kin or
 Allies could wish or desire; wherewith I am, for mine own part, so well content
 and satisfied, that I much desire my Mother, You, and other mine Allies so to
 understand it, accept, and take it; and so to use your self towards this Noble
 and Vertuous Prince, as he may have cause to continue his friendship towards
 you, which on his behalf shall nothing be empaired or altered for this Matter;
 for so hath it pleased his Highness to signify unto me, that like as he will
 shew me always a most fatherly and brotherly kindness, and has so provided for
 me; so will he remain with you, and other, according to such terms as have
 passed in the same knot of Amity which between you hath been concluded, this
 Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter notwithstanding, in such wise as neither I, ne you, or any of our
 Friends shall have just cause of miscontentment. Thus much I have 
 <pb n="201" facs="tcp:104314:321"/> thought necessary to write unto you, lest for want of
 true knowledg ye might otherwise take this Matter than ye ought, and in other
 sort care for me than ye should have cause. Only I require this of you, That ye
 so use your self, as for your untowardness in this Matter, I fare not the
 worse; whereunto I trust you will have regard.</p>

                     <p>To the first Question; I think that the Scriptures do use
this word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in divers places, according to the Matter it
treateth upon, <hi>Tobi.</hi> 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. <hi>Wisd.</hi> 2.6.12.
<hi>Dan.</hi> 2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.3, 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 10.
<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. as also it doth divers other words: Yet, what a
<hi>Sacrament</hi> is by definition, or description of Scripture, I cannot find
it explicated openly. Likewise as I cannot find the definition or description
of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> nor yet such-like things. Mary what other Men can
find, being daily and of long season exercised in Scripture, I cannot tell,
referring therefore this thing to their better knowledg.</p>
                     <p>I think that where this word, <hi>Sacramentum,</hi>

Scripture sheweth not what a Sacrament is. And yet lest any Man might be
offended, thinking, that because the Scripture sheweth not what a Sacrament is,
therefore the same is a light thing, or little to be esteemed: Here may be
remembred, that there are some weighty and godly things, being also of our
Belief, which the Scripture sheweth not expresly what they are. As for Example;
We believe the Son is consubstantial to the Father: <hi>Item</hi>; that the
Father is unbegot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet the Scripture sheweth not what is consubstantial,

                        </note>I Find not in
the Scripture, the Matter, Nature, and Effect of all these which we call the
seven Sacraments, but only of certain of them, as of <hi>Baptism,</hi> in which
we be regenerated and pardoned of our sin by the Blood of Christ: Of
<hi>Eucharistia,</hi> in which we be concorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated unto Christ, and made
lively Members of his Body, nourished <pb n="215" facs="tcp:104314:328"/> and fed to the
Everlasting Life, if we receive it as we ought to do, and else it is to us
rather Death than Life. Of <hi>Pennance</hi> also I find in the Scripture,
whereby Sinners after Baptism returning wholly unto God, be accepted again unto
God's Favour and Mercy. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaketh not of <hi>Pennance,</hi>
as we call it a Sacrament, consisting in three parts, <hi>Contrition,
Confession,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi>; but the Scripture taketh
<hi>Pennance</hi> for a pure conversion of a sinner in heart and mind from his
sins unto God, making no mention of private Confession of all deadly sins to a
Priest, nor of Ecclesiastical satisfaction to be enjoined by him. Of
<hi>Matrimony</hi> also I find very much in Scripture, and among other things,
that it is a mean whereby God doth use the infirmity of our Concupiscence to
the setting forth of his Glory, and encrease of the World, thereby sanctifying
the Act of Carnal Conjunction between the Man and the Wife to that use; yea,
altho one party be an In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>idel: and
in this <hi>Matrimony</hi> is also a Promise of Salvation, if the Parents bring
up their Children in the Faith, Love, and Fear of God. Of the Matter, Nature,
and Effect of the other three, that is to say, <hi>Confirmation, Order,</hi>
and extream <hi>Vnction,</hi> I read nothing in the Scripture as they be taken
for Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>To the seventh; Of <hi>Baptism,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>York.</hi>
                        </note> we find in Scripture the Justification by
the Word of Christ; we find also that the Matter of <hi>Baptism</hi> is Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Effect and Vertue is Remission of Sins. Of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> we find
that the Apostles did confirm those that were baptized, by laying their hands
upon them, and that the Effect then was the coming of the Holy Ghost into them,
upon whom the Apostles laid their hands, in a visible sign of the Gift of
divers Languages, and therewith of ghostly strength to confess Christ,
following upon the same. Of the Sacrament of the <hi>Altar,</hi> we find the
Institution by Christ, and the Matter thereof, Bread and Wine, the Effect,
Increase of Grace. Of the Sacrament of <hi>Pennance,</hi> we find the
Institution in the Gospel, the Effect, Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sinner, and the
union of him to the Mystical Body of Christ. Of the Sacrament of
<hi>Matrimony,</hi> we find the Institution both in the Old and New Testament,
and the Effect thereof, Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Concupiscence and discharge of sin,
which otherwise should be in the Office of Generation. Of the Sacrament of
<hi>Order,</hi> we find, that our Saviour gave to his Apostles power to
baptize, to bind and to loose sinners, to remit sins, and to receive them, to
teach and preach his Word, and to consecrate his most precious Body and Blood,
which be the highest offices of Order; and the effect thereof Grace, we find in
Scripture. Of extream <hi>Vnction,</hi> we find in the Epistle of the Holy
Apostle St. <hi>Iames,</hi> and of the Effects of the same.</p>

                        </note>I think verily,
That of the Substance, Effect, and Vertue of these seven usual Sacraments, that
are to be taken and esteemed above others, we have plainly and expresly by Holy
Scripture. Of <hi>Baptism,</hi> That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever believeth in Christ, and is
Christned, shall be saved; and except that one be born again of Water and the
Holy Ghost, he cannot come within the Kingdom of God. Of <hi>Matrimony,</hi> we
have in Scripture, both by name, and in effect, in the Old and New Testament,
both by Christ and his Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> Of the Sacrament of the
<hi>Altar,</hi> I find plainly expresly, both in the Holy Gospels, and other
places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Of <hi>Pennance</hi> in like manner. Of
<hi>Confirmation</hi> we have in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that when the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
by the preaching of <hi>Philip,</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Word of God and were
Christened; the Apostles hearing of the same, sent <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Iohn</hi> unto them; who when they came thither, they prayed for them that
they might receive the Holy Ghost: then they laid their hands upon them, and so
they received the Holy Ghost; <hi>This,</hi> saith <hi>Bede, is the Office and
Duty only of Bishops.</hi> And <hi>this manner and form</hi> (saith St.
<hi>Hierom</hi>) <hi>as it is written in the</hi> Acts, <hi>the Church hath
kept, That the Bishop should go abroad to call for the Grace of the Holy Ghost,
and lay his hands upon them, who had been Christened by Priests and
Deacons.</hi> Of the Sacrament of <hi>Orders,</hi> we have, That Christ made
his Apostles the Teachers of his Law, and Ministers of his Sacraments, that
they should duly do it, and make and ordain others likewise to do it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them. And so the Apostles ordained <hi>Matthias</hi> to be one of their number,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> made and ordained <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> with
others likewise. Of the Sacrament of <hi>Extream Vnction,</hi> we have
manifestly in the Gospel of <hi>Mark,</hi> and Epistle of St.
<hi>Iames.</hi>

                        </note>ALL Christian
Princes have committed unto them immediately of God the whole Cure of all their
Subjects, as well concerning the Administration of God's Word, for the Cure of
Souls, as concerning the ministration of things Political and Civil Governance:
And in both these Ministrations, they must have sundry Ministers under them to
sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that, which is appointed to their several Offices. The Civil Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
under the King's Majesty, in this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> be those whom it
shall please his Highness for the time to put in Authority under him: As for
Example; The Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, Lord Great Master, Lord Privy
Seal, Lord Admiral, Majors, Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Ministers of God's
Word, under his Majesty, be the Bishops, Parsons, Vicars, and such other
Priests as be appointed by his Highness to that Ministration: As for Example,
The Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Duresme,</hi> the Bishop
of <hi>Winchester,</hi> the Parson of <hi>Winwick,</hi> &amp;c. All the said
Officers and Ministers, as well of that sort as the other, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
assigned, and elected, and in every place, by the Laws and Orders of Kings and
Princes. In the admission of many of these Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, be divers comely
Ceremonies and Solemnities used, which be not of necessity, but only for a good
order and seemly fashion; for if such Offices and Ministrations were committed
without such solemnity, they were nevertheless truly committed: And there is no
more Promise of God, that Grace is given in the committing of the
Ecclesiastical Office, than it is in the committing of the Civil Office. In the
Apostles time, when there was no Christian Princes, by whose Authority
Ministers of God's Word might be appointed, nor Sins by the Sword corrected,
there was no Remedy then for the correction of Vice, or appointing of
Ministers, but only the consent of Christian Multitude among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by an
uniform consent, to follow the advice and perswasion of such Persons whom God
had most endued with the Spirit of Counsel and Wisdom: And at that time,
forasmuch as the Christian People had no Sword, nor Governour amongst them,
they were constrained of necessity to take such Curats and Priests, as either
they knew themselves to be meet thereunto, or else as were commended unto them
by others, that were so replete with the Spirit of God, with such knowledg in
the profession of Christ, such Wisdom, such Conversation and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, 
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104314:331"/> that they ought even of very Conscience to give credit
unto them, and to accept such as by them were presented: and so sometimes the
Apostles and others, unto whom God had given abundantly his Spirit, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nt or appointed Ministers of God's
Word; sometimes the People did choose such, as they thought meet thereunto; and
when any were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed or sent by the Apostles or others, the People of their
own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Will with thanks did accept them: nor for the Supremity,
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or Dominion, that the Apostles had over them to command, as their
Princes and Masters, but as good People ready to obey the advice of good
Counsellors, and to accept any thing that was necessary for their edification
and benefit.</p>

Father to make them Bishops; but if any Christian Prince had then been, the
Apostles had been, and ought to have been obedient Subjects, and would nothing
have attempted, but under the permission and assent of their Earthly Governors:
yet was it meet that they which were special and most Elect Servants of our
Saviour Christ, and were sent by him to convert the World, and having most
abundantly the Holy Ghost in them, should have special ordering of such
Ministry as pertained to the planting and encreasing of the Faith; whereunto I
doubt not, but a Christian Prince, of his godly mind, would most lovingly have
condescended. And it is to be considered, that in this Question, with other
like, this word, <hi>making of a Bishop, or Priest,</hi> may be taken two ways:
for understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, to ordain or consecrate, so it is a thing which

were made Bishops, when they had not only a Flock, but also Shepherds appointed

name of Office, signifying an Overseer. And altho the inferior Shepherds have

                        </note> for so it appeareth <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. and 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 5. with other places of Scripture. But whether any other but only
a Bishop may make a Priest, I have not read, but by singular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of God;
as when <hi>Moses</hi> (whom divers Authors say was not a Priest) made
<hi>Aaron</hi> a Priest. Truth it is, that the Office of a Godly Prince is to
over-see the Church, and the Ministers thereof; and to cause them do their
duty, and also to appoint them special Charges and Offices in the Church, as
may be most for the Glory of God, and edifying of the People: and thus we read
of the good Kings in the Old Testament, <hi>David, Ioas, Ezekias, Iosias.</hi>
But as for <hi>Making,</hi> that is to say, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining and Consecrating of
Priests, I think it specially belongeth to the Office of a Bishop, as far as
can be shewed by Scripture, or any Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as I suppose from the

St. <hi>Anselm</hi> saith, This <hi>Grace to be the Gift of the Bishops Office,
to the which God of his meer goodness had called and preferred him. The
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy</hi> (he saith) <hi>was the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, by the
which he knew what he had to do therein. The Imposition of the hands is that by
the which he was ordained and received that Office: And therefore</hi> (saith
St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>God is my Witness, that I have discharged my self,
showing you as I ought to have done. Now look you well upon it whom that ye
take to Orders, lest ye lose your self thereby. Let Bishops therefore, who</hi>
(as saith St. <hi>Hierome</hi>) <hi>hath power to make Priests, consider well
under what Law the order of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Constitution is bounden; and let
them not think those words of the Apostle to be his, but rather the words of

                        </note> touching Teaching and Preaching the Word of
God in case of such need; we think that Laymen not ordered, not only may, but
must preach Christ and his Faith to Infidels, as they shall see opportunity to
do the same, and must endeavour themselves to win the Miscreants to the Kingdom
of God, if that they can; for as the Wise Man saith, <hi>God hath given charge
to every Man of his Neighbour</hi>; and the Scripture of God <hi>chargeth every
Man to do all the good that he can to all Men:</hi> And surely this is the
highest Alms to draw Men from the Devil the Usurper, and bring them to God the
very Owner. Wherefore in this case every Man and Woman may be an Evangelist,
and of this also we have example. But touching the second part, for case of
Necessity; As we neither find Scripture, nor Example, that will bear, that any
Man, being himself no Priest, may make, that is to say, may give the Order of
Priesthood to another, and authority therewith to minister in the said Order,
and to use such Powers and Offices, as appertaineth to Priesthood grounded in
the Gospel: So we find in such case of need, what hath been done in one of the
ancient Writers; altho this authority to ordain, after form afore-mentioned, be
not to Laymen expresly prohibited in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet such a prohibition is
implied, in that there is no such autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given to them, either in Scripture
or otherways; for so much as no Man may use this or any other authority which
cometh from the Holy Ghost, unless he hath either Commission grounded in
Scripture, or else Authority by Tradition, and ancient use of Christ's Church
universally received over all.</p>

else that God would inspire in the Princes heart, to provide the best and most
handsome Remedy therein: And hard were it peradventure to find such great
necessity, but either in the train of the said Prince, or in the Regions
adjoining thereunto, there might be had some Priests for the said purposes; or,
finally, That the Prince himself, godlily inspired in that behalf, might, for
so good purposes and intents, set forth the Act indeed, referring yet this
thing to the better judgment of others.</p>

In this case, as we have said in the next Article afore, Teaching of the Word
of God may be used by any that can and would use it, to the Glory of God; and
in this case also the Sacrament of Baptism may be ministred by those that be no
Priests; which things altho we have not of Scripture, yet the universal
Tradition and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church, doth teach us: And peradventure contract
of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony might also be made, the Solemnization thereof being only
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Law positive, and not by any ground, either of Scripture, or of
Tradition; altho for very urgent causes, the said Solemnization is to be
observed when it may be observed; but that the Princes may not Make, that is,
may not Order Priests nor Bishops not before Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to minister the other
Sacraments, the ministry whereof in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is committed only to the
Apostles, and from them derived to their Successors, even from the Primitive
Church hitherto, and by none other used, we have answered in the thirteenth
Article.</p>

                        </note>To the fifteenth;
This Scripture is indifferent to secret and open Sins; nor the authority given
in the same is appointed or limited, either to the one, or to the other, but is
given commonly to both: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing that the Sinner is in no other
place of Scripture discharged of the confession of his secret Sins, we think,
that this place chargeth him to confess the secret Sins, as well as the
open.</p>
                     <p>To the fifteenth; I think that as the Sinner is bound by
this authority to confess his open sins,<note place="margin">

                        </note> so also is he bound to confess his secret
sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the special end is, to wit, <hi>Absolutionem a peccato cujus
fecit se ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum,</hi> is all one in both cases: And that all sins as touching
God are open, and in no wise secret or hid.</p>
                     <p>I think that confession of secret deadly sins is necessary
for to attain absolution of them;<note place="margin">

                        </note>
but whether every Man that hath secretly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted deadly sin, is bound by
these words to ask Absolution of the Priest therefore, it is an hard Question,
and of much controversy amongst learned Men, and I am not able to define
betwixt them; but I think it is the surest way, to say that a Man is bound to

                     <p>I think, that altho in these words Confession of privy
Sins,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Redmayn.</hi>
                        </note> is not expresly commanded;
yet it is insinuated and shewed in these words, as a necessary Medicine or
Remedy, which all Men that fall into deadly sin ought, for the quieting of
their Consciences seek, if they may conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently have such a Priest as is meet
to hear their Confession.</p>
                     <p>Where there be two ways to obtain remission of Sin,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Edgeworth</hi>
                        </note> and to recover Grace, a Man is bound
by the Law of Nature to take the surer way, or else he should seem to contemn
his own Health, which is unnatural. Also because we be bound to love God above
all things, we ought by the same Bond to labour for his Grace and Favour: So
that because we be bound to love God, and to love our selves in an Order to
God, we be bound to seek the best and surest Remedy to recover Grace for our
selves. Contrition is one way; but because a Man cannot be well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
whether his Contrition, Attrition, or Displeasure for his sin be sufficient to
satisfie or content Almighty God, and able or worthy to get his Grace:
Therefore it is necessary to take that way that will not fail, and by which
thou mayest be sure, and that is Absolution of the Priest, which by Christ's
promise will not deceive thee, so that thou put no step or bar in the way; as,
if thou do not then actually sin inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor outwardly, but intend to receive
that the Church intendeth to give thee by that Absolution, having the
efficacity of Christ's promise, <hi>Quorum Remiseritis,</hi> &amp;c. Now the
Priest can give thee no Absolution from that sin that he knoweth not: therefore
thou art bound, for the causes aforesaid, to confess thy sin.</p>

to the Law of God, and it is a wise point, and a wholsome thing so for to do,
and God provoketh and allureth us thereto, in giving the active Power to
Priests to assoil in the words, <hi>Quorum Remiseritis.</hi> It is also a safer
way for Salvation to confess, if we may have a Priest: Yet I think that
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is not necessarily deduced of Scripture, nor commanded as a

                     <head>16. Question. Whether a Bishop or a Priest may
excommunicate, and for what Crimes? And whether they only may Excommunicate by
God's Law?</head>
                     <head type="sub">Answers.</head>
                     <p>A Bishop or a Priest by the Scripture,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Canterbury</hi>
                        </note> is neither commanded nor forbidden to
Excommunicate, but where the Laws of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion giveth him authority to
Excommunicate, there they ought to use the same in such Crimes, as the Laws
have such authority in; and where the Laws of the Region forbiddeth them, there
they have no authority at all; and they that be no Priests may also
Excommunicate, if the Law allow thereunto.</p>
                     <p>To the sixteenth; The power to Excommunicate, that is,<note place="margin">

                        </note> to dissever the Sinner from the communion of

                              <desc>•</desc>

Gospel, but for what Crimes, altho in the Gospel doth not appear, saving only
for diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience against the Commandment of the Church, yet we find exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Excommunication used by the Apostles in other cases: As of the Fornicator by
<hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> for their Blaspemy
by the same; and yet of other Crimes mentioned in the Epistle of the said
<hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> And again of them that were
disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his Doctrine, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. We find also charge given to
us, by the Apostle St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that we shall not commune with them, nor
so much as salute him with <hi>Ave,</hi> that would not receive his Doctrine.
By which it may appear that Excommunication, may be used for many great Crimes,
and yet the Church at this day, doth not use it, but only for manifest
disobedience. And this kind of Excommunication, whereby Man is put out of the
Church, and dissevered from the Unity of Christ's Mystical Body, which
Excommunication toucheth also the Soul, no Man may use, but they only, to whom
it is given by Christ.</p>
                     <p>To the sixteenth; I think that a Bishop may
Excommunicate,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>London.</hi>
                        </note> taking example of St.
<hi>Paul</hi> with the <hi>Corinthian</hi>; and also of that he did to
<hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Hymeneus.</hi> And with the Lawyers it hath been a
thing out of Question, That to Excommunicate solemnly, appertaineth to a
Bishop, altho otherwise, both inferior Prelates and other Officers, yea and
Priests too in notorious Crimes, after divers Mens Opinions, may Excommunicate
semblably, as all others that be appointed Governors and Rulers over any
Multitude, or Spiritual Congregation.</p>
                     <p>I answer affirmatively to the first part, in open and
manifest Crimes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rochester.</hi>
                        </note> meaning of such
Priests and Bishops as be by the Church authorized to use that power. To the
second part, I answer, That it is an hard Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, wherein I had rather hear
other Men speak, than say my own <pb n="240" facs="tcp:104314:341"/> Sentence; for I find
not in Scripture, nor in the old Doctors, that any Man hath given Sentence of
Excommunication, save only Priests; but yet I think, that it is not against the
Law of God, that a Lay-man should have authority to do it.</p>

                     <hi>XXII.</hi> Dr. <hi>Barnes</hi>'s Renunciation of some
 Articles informed against him.</head>
                  <p>BE it known to all Men, that I <hi>Robert Barnes,</hi> Doctor
 of Divinity, have as well in Writing, as in Preaching, over-shot my self, and
 been deceived, by trusting too much to mine own heady Sentence, and giving
 judgment in and touching the Articles hereafter ensuing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as being
 convented, and called before the Person of my most gracious Soveraign Lord King
 <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France,</hi>
 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensor of the Faith, Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in Earth Supream Head
 im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under God of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; It pleased his
 High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, of his great clemency and goodness, being assisted with sundry of
 his most discreet and learned Clergy, to enter such Disputation and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
 with me, upon the Points of my over-sight, as by the same was fully and
 perfectly confuted by Scriptures, and enforced only for Truths sake, and for
 want of defence of Scriptures to serve for the maintenance of my part, to
 yeeld, confess, and knowledg my ignorance, and with my most humble submission,
 do promise for ever from henceforth to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain and beware of such rashness:
 And for my further declaration therein, not only to abide such order for my
 doings passed, as his Grace shall appoint and assign unto me, but also with my
 heart to advance and set forth the said Articles ensuing, which I knowledg and
 confess to be most Catholick, and Christian, and necessary to be received,
 observed, and followed of all good Christian People. Tho it so be, that Christ
 by the Will of his Father, is he only which hath suffered Passion and Death for
 redemption of all such as will and shall come unto him, by perfect Faith and
 Baptism; and that also he hath taken upon him <hi>gratis</hi> the burden of all
 their sins, which as afore will, hath, or shall come to him, paying sufficient
 Ransom for all their sins, and so is becomed their only Redeemer and Justifier;
 of the which number I trust and doubt not but that many of us now-adays be of:
 yet I in heart do confess, that after, by the foresaid means we become right
 Christian Folks, yet then by not following our Master's Commandments and Laws,
 we do loose <pb n="245" facs="tcp:104314:343"/> the benefits and fruition of the same, which
 in this case is irrecuperable, but by true Penance, the only Remedy left unto
 us by our Saviour for the same; wherefore I think it more than convenient and
 necessary, that whensoever Justification shall be preached of, that this deed
 be joined with all the fore-part, to the intent that it may teach all true
 Christian People a right knowledg of their Justification.</p>
                  <bibl>By me <hi>Robert Barnes.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Also I confess with my heart, That Almighty God is in no wise
 Author, causer of Sin, or any Evil; and therefore whereas Scripture saith,
 <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duravit Dominus Cor Pharaonis, &amp;c.</hi> and such other Texts of like
 sense, they ought to understand them, <hi>quod Dominus permisit eum
 indurari,</hi> and not otherwise; which doth accord with many of the ancient
 Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters also.</p>

                  </bibl>
                  <p>Further I do confess with my heart, That whensoever I have
 of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended my Neighbours, I must first reconcile my self unto him, e're I shall
 get remission of my sins, and in case he offend me, I must forgive him, e're
 that I can be forgiven; for this doth the <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> and other
 places of Scripture teach me.</p>

                  </bibl>
                  <p>I do also confess with my heart, That good Works limited by
 Scripture, and done by a penitent and true reconciled Christian Man, be
 profitable and allowable unto him, as allowed of God for his benefit, and
 helping to his Salvation.</p>
                  <bibl>By me <hi>Robert Barnes.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Also do confess with my heart, That Laws and Ordinances made
 by Christian Rulers, ought to be obeyed by the Inferiors and Subjects, not only
 for fear, but also for Conscience, for whoso breaketh them, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God's
 Commandments.</p>

 Catholick, and promise with my heart, by God's Grace, hereafter to maintain,

                  <head>XXIV. A Proclamation ordained by the King's Majesty, with

 Volume to be had in every Church; devised the sixth day of <hi>May,</hi> the
 <hi>33</hi> year of the King's most gracious Reign.</head>

21.</note>WHereby Injunctions heretofore set forth by the authority of the
 King's Royal Majesty, Supream Head of the Church of this his Realm of
 <hi>England,</hi> it was ordained, and commanded, amongst other things, That in
 all and singular Parish-Churches, there should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, by a certain day
 now expired, at the costs of the Curats and Parishioners, Bibles containing the
 Old and New Testament in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Tongue, to be fixed and set up openly in
 every of the said Parish Churches; the which godly Commandment and Injunction,
 was to the only intent that every of the King's Majesties loving Subjects,
 minding to read therein, might, by occasion thereof, not only consider and
 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the great and ineffable Omnipotent Power, Promise, Justice, Mercy and
 Goodness of Almighty God, but also to learn thereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve God's
 Commandments, and to obey their Sovereign Lord, and High Powers, and to
 exercise Godly Charity, and to use themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Vocations, in
 a pure and sincere Christian Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmur or grudging: By the which
 Injunctions, the King's Royal Majesty intended that his loving Subjects should
 have and use the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the reading of the said Bibles, for the
 purpose above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, humbly, meekly, reverently, and obediently, and not
 that any of them should read the said Bibles with high and loud Voices, in time
 of the Celebration of the Holy Mass, and other Divine Services used in the
 Church; or that any his Lay-Subjects reading the same, should presume to take
 upon them any common Disputation, Argument, or Exposition of the Mysteries
 therein contained; but that every such Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should, humbly, meekly, and
 reverently, read the same for his own instruction, edification, and amendment
 of his Life, according to God's Holy Word therein mentioned. And
 notwithstanding the King's said most godly and gracious Commandment and
 Injunction, in form as is aforesaid, his Royal Majesty is informed, That divers
 and many Towns and Parishes within this his Realm, have neglected their duties
 in the accomplishment thereof; whereof his Highness marvelleth not a little;
 and minding the execution of his said former most godly and gracious
 Injunctions, doth straitly charge and command, That the Curats and Parishioners
 of every Town and Parish within this his Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not having
 already Bibles provided within their Parish Churches, shall on this side the
 Feast of <hi>All-Saints</hi> next coming, buy and provide Bibles of the largest
 and greatest Volume, and cause the same to be set and fixed in every of the
 said Parish Churches, there to be used as is afore-said, according to the said
 former Injunctions, upon pain that the Curat and Inhabitants of the Parishes
 and Towns, shall loose and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit to the King's Majesty for every month that
 they shall lack and want the said Bibles, after the same Feast of
 <hi>All-Saints,</hi> 40 <hi>s.</hi> the one half of the same forfeit to be to
 the King's Majesty, and the other half to him <pb n="251" facs="tcp:104314:346"/> or them
 which shall first find and present the same to the King's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Council.
 And finally, the King's Royal Majesty doth declare and signify to all and
 singular his loving Subjects, that to the intent they may have the said Bibles
 of the greatest Volumn, at equal and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prices, his Highness, by the
 advice of his Council, hath ordained and taxed, That the Sellers thereof shall
 not take for any of the said Bibles unbound, above the price of ten shillings;
 and for every of the said Bibles well and sufficiently bound, trimmed and
 clasped, not above twelve shillings, upon pain the Seller to lose, for every
 Bible sold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Highness's Proclamation, four shillings, the one
 Moiety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the King's Majesty, and the other Moiety to the finder and
 presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Defaulter, as is aforesaid. And his Highness straitly
 chargeth and commandeth, That all and singular Ordinaries, having
 Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Jurisdiction within this his Church and Realm of
 <hi>England,</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Wales,</hi> that they, and every of
 them, shall put their effectual endeavours, that the Curats and Parishioners
 shall obey and accomplish this his Majesties Proclamation and Commandment, as
 they tender the advancement of the King's most gracious and godly purpose in
 that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and as they will answer to his Highness for the same.</p>

                     <hi>Item</hi>; That ye being absent from
 your Benefices, in cases lawfully permitted by the Laws and Statutes of this
 Realm, do suffer no Priest to keep your Cure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unless he being first by you

 more and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter assurance and performance thereof to be had, by these presents
 I warn and monish peremptorily, all and singular Beneficed Parsons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
 Benefices with Cure, within my Diocess and Jurisdiction, that they and every of
 them, shall either be personally resident upon their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Cures,

 else present, before the said Feast, to me the said Bishop, my Vicar-General,
 or other my Officers deputed in that behalf, such Curats as upon examination
 made by me, or my said Officers, may be found able and sufficient to serve and
 discharge their Cures in their absence; and also at the said Feast, or before,
 shall bring in and exhibite before my said Officers their sufficient
 Dispensations authorized by the King's Majesty, as well for non-residence, as
 for keeping of more Benefices with Cure than one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That every Parson, Vicar, and other Curats,
 once in every quarter, shall openly in the Pulpit exhort and charge his
 Parishioners, that they in no wise do make any privy or secret contract of
 Matrimony between themselves, but that they utterly defer it until such time as
 they may conveniently have the Father and Mother, or some other Kinsfolks or
 Friends of the Person that shall make such Contract of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony; or else two
 or three honest Persons to be present, and to hear and record the words and
 manner of their Contract, as they will avoid the extream pains of the Law
 provided in that behalf, if they presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously do or attempt the
 contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That in the avoiding of divers and grievous
 Offences and Enormities, and specially the most detestable sin of Adultery,
 which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hath hapned by the negligence of Curats in marrying Persons
 to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether which had been married before, and making no due proof of the death
 of their other Husbands and Wives at the time of such Marriages, I require and
 command you, and monish peremptorily by these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, all manner of Parsons,
 Vicars, and Curats, with other Priests, being of my Diocess and Jurisdiction,
 that they, nor any of them from henceforth, do presume to solemnizate Matrimony
 in their Churches, Chappels, or elsewhere, between any Persons that have been
 married before, unless the said Parson, Vicar, Curat, or Priest, be first
 plainly, fully, and sufficiently informed and certified of the Decease of the
 Wife or Husband of him or her, or of both, that he shall marry, and that in
 writing, under the Ordinaries Seal of the Diocess, or place where he or she
 inhabited or dwelt before, under pain of Excommunication, and otherwise to be
 punished for doing the contrary, according to the Laws provided and made in
 that behalf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That ye, and every of you that be Parsons,
 Vicars, Curats, and also Chauntry-Priests and Stipendiaries, do instruct,
 teach, and bring up in Learning the best ye can, all such Children of your
 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners as shall come to you for the same; or at the least, to teach them
 to read English, taking moderately therefore of their Friends that be able to
 pay, so that they may thereby the better learn and know how to Believe, how to
 Pray, how to live to God's pleasure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:104314:348"/>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That every Curat do at
 all times his best diligence to stir, move, and reduce such as be at discord,
 to Peace, Concord, Love, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and one to remit and forgive one another, as
 often and howsoever they shall be grieved or offended: And that the Curat shew
 and give example thereof, when and as often as any variance or discord shall
 hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be between him and any of his Cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; Where some froward Persons, partly for malice,
 hatred, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and disdain, neglect contemn and despise their Curats,
 and such as have the Cure and Charge of their Souls, and partly to hide and
 cloak their leud and naughty living, as they have used all the Year before, use
 at length to be confessed of other Priests which have not the Cure of their
 Souls: Wherefore I will and require you to declare, and show to your
 Parishioners, That no Testimonials brought from any of them, shall stand in any
 effect, nor that any such Persons shall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God's Board, or receive
 their Communion, until they have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselves to be confessed of their
 own Curats, (Strangers only except) or else upon arduous and urgent Causes and
 Considerations, they be otherwise dispensed with in that behalf, either by me
 or by my Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That whereupon a detestable and abominable
 practice univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally reigning in your Parishes, the young People, and other
 ill-disposed Persons doth use upon the <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holy-days,</hi>
 in time of Divine Service, and preaching the Word of God, to resort unto
 Ale-houses, and there exerciseth unlawful Games, with great Swearing,
 Blasphemy, Drunkenness, and other Enormities, so that good and devout Persons
 be much offended therewith: Wherefore I require and command you, to declare to
 such as keepeth Ale-houses, or Taverns within your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, that at such
 times from henceforth, they shall not suffer in their Houses any such unlawful
 and ungodly Assemblies; neither receive such Persons to Bowling and Drinking at
 such Seasons, into their Houses, under pain of Excommunication, and otherwise
 to be punished for their so doing, according to the Laws in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That all Curats shall declare openly in the
 Pulpit, twice eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Quarter to their Parishioners, the seven deadly Sins, and
 the Ten Commandments, so that the People thereby may not only learn how to
 obey, honour, and serve God, their Prince, Superiors, and Parents, but also to
 avoid and eschew Sin and Vice, and to live vertuously, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's
 Commandments and his Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That where I am credily informed, that certain
 Priests of my Diocess and Jurisdiction, doth use to go in an unseemly and
 unpriestly habit and apparel, with unlawful tonsures, carrying and having upon
 them also Armour and Weapons, contrary to all wholsome and godly Laws and
 Ordinances, more like Persons of the Lay, than of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; which may and
 doth minister occasion to light Persons, and to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons unknown, where such
 Persons come in place, to be more licentious both of their Communication, and
 also of their Acts, to the great slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Clergy: Wherefore in the
 avoiding of such slander and oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy hereafter, I admonish and command all and
 singular Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and all other Priests whatsoever they be,
 dwelling, or inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or hereafter shall dwell and inhabit within my
 Diocess and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, That from henceforth they, and every of them, do use
 and <pb n="255" facs="tcp:104314:348"/> wear meet, convenient, and decent Apparel, with
 their Trussures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, whereby they may be known at all times from
 Lay-People, and to be of the Clergy, as they intend to avoid and eschew the
 penalty of the Laws ordained in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That no Parson, Vicar, or other Beneficed Man,
 having Cure within my Diocess and Jurisdiction, do suffer any Priest to say
 Mass, or to have any Service within their Cure, unless they first give
 knowledg, and present them with the Letters of their Orders to me as Ordinary,
 or to my Officers deputed in that behalf; and the said Priest so presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
 shall be by me, or my said Officers, found able and sufficient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That every Curat, not only in his Preachings,
 open Sermons, and Collations made to the People, but also at all other times
 necessary, do perswade, exhort, and monish the People, being of his Cure,
 what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they be, to beware and abstain from Swearing and blaspheming of the
 Holy Name of God, or any part of Christ's most precious Body or Blood. And
 likewise to beware, and abstain from Cursing, Banning, Chiding, Scolding,
 Backbiting, Slandering, and Lying. And also from talking and jangling in the
 Church, specially in time of Divine-Service, or Sermon-time. And semblably to
 abstain from Adultery, Fornication, Gluttony and Drunkenness: And if they, or
 any of them, be found notoriously faulty or infamed upon any of the said Crimes
 and Offences, then to detect them at every Visitation, or sooner, as the case
 shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, so that the said Offenders may be corrected and reformed to the
 example of other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That no Priest from henceforth do use any
 unlawful Games, or frequently use any Ale-houses, Taverns, or any suspect place
 at any unlawful times, or any light Company, but only for their Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
 as they, and any of them, will avoid the danger that may ensue thereupon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That in the Plague-time, no dead Bodies or
 Corpses be brought into the Church, except it be brought streight to the Grave,
 and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately buried, whereby the People may the rather avoid
 infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That no Parsons, Vicars, nor Curats, permit or
 suffer any manner of common Plays, Games, or Interludes, to be played,
 setforth, or declared, within their Churches or Chappels, contrary to this our
 forbidding and Commandment; that then you, or either of you, in whose Churches
 or Chappels any such Games, Plays, or Interludes shall be so used, shall
 immediately thereupon make relation of the names of the Person or Persons so
 obstinately and disobediently using them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, unto me, my Chancellor, or
 other my Officers, to the intent that they may be therefore reformed and
 punished according to the Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That all Priests shall take this order when
 they Preach; first, They shall not rehearse no Sermons made by other Men within
 this 200 or 300 Years; but when they shall preach, they shall take the Gospel
 or Epistle of the day, which they shall recite and declare to the people,
 plainly, distinctly, and sincerely, from the beginning to the end thereof, and
 then to desire the people to pray with them for Grace, after the usage of the
 Church of <hi>England</hi> now used: And that done, we will that every Preacher
 shall declare the same Gospel or Epistle, or both, <pb n="256" facs="tcp:104314:349"/> from
 the beginning, not after his own Mind, but after the Mind of some Catholick
 Doctor allowed in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> and in no wise to affirm any
 thing, but that which he shall be ready always to shew in some Ancient Writer;
 and in no wise to make rehearsal of any Opinion not allowed, for the intent to
 reprove the same, but to leave that for those that are and shall be admitted to
 preach by the King's Majesty, or by me the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> your
 Ordinary, or by mine authority. In the which Epistle and Gospel, ye shall note
 and consider diligently certain godly and devout places, which may incense and
 stir the Hearers to obedience of good Works and Prayers: And in case any
 notable Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony used to be observed in the Church, shall happen that day when
 any preaching shall be appointed, it shall be meet and convenient that the
 Preacher declare and set forth to the people the true meaning of the same, in
 such sort that the people may perceive thereby, what is meant and signified by
 such Ceremony, and also know how to use and accept it to their own edifying.
 Furthermore, That no Preacher shall rage or rail in his Sermon, but coldly,
 discreetly, and charitably, open, declare, and set forth the excellency of
 Vertue, and to suppress the abomination of Sin and Vice; every Preacher shall,
 if time and occasion will serve, instruct and teach his Audience, what Prayer
 is used in the Church that day, and for what thing the Church prayeth,
 specially that day, to the intent that all the people may pray together with
 one heart for the same; and as occasion will serve, to shew and declare to the
 people what the Sacraments signifieth, what strength and efficacy they be of,
 how every Man should use them reverently and devoutly at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of
 them. And to declare wherefore the Mass is so highly to be esteemed and
 honoured, with all the Circumstances appertaining to the same. Let every
 Preacher beware that he do not feed his Audience with any Fable, or other
 Histories, other than he can avouch and justify to be written by some allowed
 Writer. And when he hath done all that he will say and utter for that time, he
 shall then in few words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite again the pith and effect of his whole Sermon,
 and add thereunto as he shall think good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; That no Parson, Vicar, Curat, or other Priest,
 having Cure of Souls within my Diocess and Jurisdiction, shall from hence-forth
 permit, suffer, or admit any manner of person, of whatsoever estate or
 condition he be, under the degree of a Bishop, to preach, or make any Sermon or
 Collation openly to the people within their Churches, Chappels, or else-where
 within their Cures, unless he that shall so preach, have obtained before
 special License in that behalf, of our Sovereign Lord the King, or of me
 <hi>Edmund</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> your Ordinary; And the same License
 so obtained, shall then and there really bring forth in writing under Seal, and
 shew the same to the said Parson, Vicar, Curat, or Priest, before the beginning
 of his Sermon, as they will avoid the extream Penalties of the Laws, Statutes,
 and Ordinances, provided and established in that behalf, if they presumptuously
 do or attempt any thing to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi>; I desire, require, exhort, and command you, and

 greet you well, and let you wit, That calling to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the miserable
 state of all Christendom, being at this present, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all other troubles,
 so plagued with most cruel Wars, Hatred, and Dissensions, as no place of the
 same almost (being the whole reduced to a very narrow corner) remaineth in good
 Peace, Agreement, and Concord; the help and remedy whereof far exceeding the
 power of any Man, must be called for of him who only is able to grant our
 Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and never forsaketh nor repelleth any that firmly believe and
 faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call on him; unto whom also the example of Scripture encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
 us, in all these and other our troubles and necessities, to fly and to cry for
 aid and succour; being therefore resolved to have continually from henceforth
 general Processions, in all Cities, Towns, Churches, and Parishes of this our
 Realm, said and sung, with such reverence and devotion as appertaineth.
 Forasmuch as heretofore the People, partly for lack of good Instruction and
 Calling, and partly for that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood no part of such Prayers or
 Suffrages as were used to be sung and said, have used to come very slackly to
 the Procession, when the same have been commanded heretofore; We have set forth
 certain godly Prayers and Suffrages in our Native English Tongue, which we send
 you herewith, signifying unto you, That for the special trust and confidence we
 have of your godly mind, and earnest desire, to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forward of the
 Glory of God, and the true worshipping of his

 Province committed by us unto you, we <pb n="265" facs="tcp:104314:353"/> have sent unto you
 these Suffrages, not to be for a month or two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and after slenderly
 considered, as other our Injunctions have, to our no little marvel, been used;
 but to the intent that as well the same, as other our Injunctions, may be
 earnestly set forth by preaching good Exhortations and otherwise to the People,
 in such sort as they feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the godly tast thereof, may godly and joyously,
 with thanks, receive, embrace, and frequent the same, as appertaineth.
 Wherefore we will and command you, as you will answer unto us for the contrary,
 not only to cause these Prayers and Suffrages aforesaid to be published,
 fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and openly used in all Towns, Churches, Villages, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes of
 your own Diocess, but also to signify this our pleasure unto all other Bishops
 of your Province, willing and commanding them in our Name, and by virtue
 hereof, to do and execute the same accordingly. Unto whose Proceedings, in the
 execution of this our Commandment, we will that you have a special respect, and
 make report unto us, if any shall not with good dexterity accomplish the same;
 Not failing, as our special trust is in you.</p>

 <hi>Shaxton,</hi> late Bp of <hi>Sarum.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe <hi>First</hi>; Almighty God, by the Power of his
 Word,<note place="margin">Regist. <hi>Bonner.</hi> Fol. 100.</note> pronounced by
 the Priest at Mass in the Consecration, turneth the Bread and Wine into the
 natural Body and Blood of our Saviour Jesus Christ; so that after the
 Consecration, there remaineth no Substance of Bread and Wine, but only the
 substance of Christ, God and Man.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi>; The said Blessed Sacrament being once
 Consecrate, is and remaineth still the very Body and Blood of our Saviour
 Christ, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be reserved, and not presently distributed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi>; The same blessed Sacrament being
 consecrate, is and ought to be worshipped and adored with godly honour
 wheresoever it is, forasmuch as it is the Body of Christ inseparably united to
 the Deity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi>; The Church, by the Ministration of the
 Priest, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth daily at the Mass for a Sacrifice to Almighty God, the
 self-same Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ, under the form of Bread and
 Wine, in the remembrance and representation of Christ's Death and Passion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi>; The same Body and Blood which is offered
 in the Mass, is the very propitiation and satisfaction for the sins of the
 World; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as it is the self-same in Substance which was offered upon
 the Cross for our Redemption: And the Oblation and Action of the Priest is also
 a Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving unto God for his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, 
 <pb n="266" facs="tcp:104314:354"/> and not the satisfaction for the Sins of the World, for
 that is only to be attributed to Christ's Passion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi>; The said Oblation, or Sacrifice, so by the
 Priest offered in the Mass, is available and profitable, both for the Quick and
 the Dead, altho it lieth not in the power of Man to limit how much, or in what
 measure the same doth avail.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi>; It is not a thing of necessity, that the
 Sacrament of the Altar should be ministred unto the People under both kinds, of
 Bread and Wine: and it is none abuse that the same be ministred to the People
 under the one kind; forasmuch as in every of both the kinds, whole Christ, both
 Body and Blood is contained.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eighth</hi>; It is no derogation to the vertue of the
 Mass, altho the Priest do receive the Sacrament alone, and none other receive
 it with him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ninth</hi>; The Mass used in this Realm of
 <hi>England,</hi> is agreeable to the institution of Christ; and we have in
 this Church of <hi>England,</hi> the very true Sacrament, which is the very
 Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ, under the form of Bread and Wine.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tenth</hi>; The Church of Christ hath, doth, and may
 lawfully order some Priests to be Ministers of the Sacraments, altho the same
 do not preach, nor be not admitted thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eleventh</hi>; Priests being once dedicated unto God
 by the Order of Priesthood, and all such Men and Women as have advisedly made
 Vows unto God of Chastity or Widowhood, may not lawfully marry, after their
 said Orders received, or Vows made.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Twelfth</hi>; Secret auricular Confession is expedient
 and necessary to be retained, continued, and frequented in the Church of
 Christ.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Thirteenth</hi>; The Prescience and Predestination of
 Almighty God, altho in it self it be infallible, induceth no necessity to the
 Action of Man, but that he may freely use the power of his own will or choice,
 the said Prescience or Predestination notwithstanding.</p>

                        </gap>tyr.</note> and hereby think to make her incapable of
 the Inheritance of <hi>England.</hi> To that you know for answer what may be
 said by an <hi>English</hi> Patron of my Mistriss's Cause, although I being a
 <hi>Scot</hi> will not affirm the same, that there ariseth amongst you a
 Question; Whether the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi> be forth of the Homage and
 Leageance of <hi>England:</hi> And therefore you have in sundry Proclamations
 preceding your Wars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, and in sundry Books at sundry times, laboured much
 to prove the Homage and Fealty of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England.</hi> Your
 Stories also be not void of this intent. What the judgment of the Fathers of
 your Law is, and what commonly is thought in this Matter, you know better than
 I, and may have better intelligence than I, the Argument being fitter for your
 Assertion than mine.</p>
                  <p>Another Question there is also upon this Objection of Forreign
 Birth; that is to say, Whether Princes inheritable to the Crown, be in case of
 the Crown exempted or concluded as private Persons, being Strangers born forth
 of the Allegiance of <hi>England.</hi> You know in this case, as divers others,
 the State of the Crown: the Persons inheritable to the Crown at the time of
 their Capacity, have divers differences and prerogatives from other Persons;
 many Laws made for other Persons take no hold in case of the Prince, and they
 have such Priviledges as other Persons enjoy not: As in cases of Attainders,
 and other Penal Laws: Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. who being a Subject, was
 attainted; and <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. and his Father <hi>Richard Plantagenet</hi> were
 both attainted; all which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Attainders had right to the
 Crown, and two of them attained the same. Amongst many Reasons to be shewed,
 both for the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that Forreign Birth doth not take place in the
 case of the Crown, as in common Persons, the many experiences before the
 Conquest, and since, of your King's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do plainly testify. 2. Of purpose I
 will name unto you, <hi>Hen.</hi> 2d. <hi>Maud</hi> the Empress Son, and
 <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the Black Princes Son, the rather for
 that neither of the two was the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Son, and so not
 <hi>Enfant du Roy,</hi> if the word be taken in this strict signification. And
 for the better proof, that it was always the common Law of your Realm, that in
 the case of the Crown, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Birth was no Bar; you do remember the words of
 the Stat. 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. where it is said, the Law was ever so: Whereupon
 if you can remember it, you and I fell out at a reasoning in my Lord of
 <hi>Leicester</hi>'s Chamber, by the occasion of the Abridgment of
 <hi>Rastal,</hi> wherein I did shew you somewhat to this purpose; also these
 words, <hi>Infant</hi> and <hi>Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> be in <hi>Praedicamento ad
 aliquid,</hi> and so Correlatives in such sort, as the meaning of the Law was
 not to restrain the understanding of this word <hi>Infant,</hi> so strict as
 only to the Children of the King's Body, but to others inheritable in
 remainder; and if some Sophisters will needs cavil about the precise
 understanding of <hi>Infant,</hi> let them be <pb n="268" facs="tcp:104314:355"/> answered
 with the scope of this word <hi>Ancestors</hi> in all Provisions, for
 <hi>Filii, Nepotes</hi> and <hi>Liberi,</hi> you may see there was no
 difference betwixt the first degree, and these that come after by the Civil
 Law. <hi>Liberorum appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione comprehenduntur non solum Filii, verum etiam
 Nepotes, Pronepotes, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nepotes,</hi> &amp;c. If you examine the Reason why
 Forreign Birth is exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you may see that it was not so needful in Princes
 Cases, as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Persons. Moreover, I know that <hi>England</hi> hath
 oftentimes mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with Daughters, and married with the greatest Forreign
 Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi> And so I do also understand, that they all did
 repute the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of them, and of the Daughters of <hi>England,</hi>
 inheritable in successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that Crown, notwithstanding the Forreign Birth of
 their Issue: And in this case I do appeal to all Chronicles, to their Contracts
 of Marriages, and to the opinion of all the Princes of Christendom. For tho
 <hi>England</hi> be a noble and puissant Country, the respect of the Alliance
 only, and the Dowry, hath not moved the great Princes to match so often in
 marriage, but the possibility of the Crown in succession. I cannot be ignorant
 al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in this Matter, considering that I serve my Sovereign in the room
 that you serve yours. The Contract of Marriage is extant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King, my
 Mistris's Grandfather, and Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to King
 <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> by whose Person the Title is devolved on my
 Sovereign; what her Fathers meaning was in bestowing of her, the World knoweth,
 by that which is contained in the Chronicles written by <hi>Polidorus
 Virgilius,</hi> before (as I think) either you or I was born; at least when it
 was little thought that this Matter should come in question. There is another
 Exception also laid against my Soveraign, which seems at the first to be of
 some weight, grounded upon some Statutes made in King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. time,
 <hi>(viz.)</hi> of the 28<hi>th,</hi> &amp; 35<hi>th</hi> of his Reign, whereby
 full power and authority was given him the said King <hi>Henry,</hi> to give,
 dispose, appoint, assign, declare, and limit, by his Letters Patents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his
 Great Seal, or else by his last Will made in writing, and signed with his hand
 at his pleasure, from time to time thereafter the Imperial Crown of that Realm,
 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Imperial Crown is by some alledged and constantly
 affirmed to have been limited and disposed, by the last Will and Testament of
 the said King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. signed with his hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, unto the
 Children of the Lady <hi>Francis</hi>; and <hi>Elenor,</hi> Daughter to
 <hi>Mary</hi> the French Queen, younger Daughter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. and of
 <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi>; so as it is thought the
 Queen, my Soveraign, and all others, by course of Inheritance, be by these
 Circumstances excluded and fore-closed: So as it does well become all Subjects,
 such as I am, so my liking is, to speak of Princes, of their Reigns and
 Proceedings modestly, and with respect; yet I cannot abstain to say, that the
 Chronicles and Histories of that Age, and your own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Statutes being
 extant, do contaminate and disgrace greatly the Reign of that King in that
 time. But to come to our purpose, what equity and justice was that to
 disinherit a Race of Forreign Princes of their possibility, and maternal right,
 by a municipal Law or Statute made in that, which some would term abrupt time,
 and say, that that would rule the Roast, yea, and to exclude the right Heirs
 from their Title, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling them to answer, or any for them: well, it
 may be said, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he injury of the
 time, and the indirect dealing is not to be allowed;
 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut since it is done it cannot be
 avoided, unless some Circumstances <pb n="269" facs="tcp:104314:355"/> material do
 annihilate the said limitation and disposition of the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Now let us examine the manner and circumstances how King
 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. was by Statute inabled to dispose the Crown. There is a form
 in two sorts prescribed him, which he may not transgress, that is to say,
 either by his Letters Patents, sealed with his Great Seal, or by his last Will,
 signed with his hand: for in this extraordinary case he was held to an ordinary
 and precise form; which being not observed, the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, or Will,
 cannot work the intent or effect supposed. And to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, that the Will was
 signed with his own hand; You know, that long before his death he never used
 his own signing with his own hand; and in the time of his Sickness, being
 divers times pressed to put his hand to the Will written, he refused to do it.
 And it seemed God would not suffer him to proceed in an Act so injurious and
 prejudicial to the right Heir of the Crown, being his Niece. Then his death
 ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, some as well known to you as to me, caused <hi>William
 Clarke,</hi> sometimes Servant to <hi>Thomas Henneage,</hi> to sign the
 supposed Will with a stamp, (for otherwise signed it was never); and yet
 notwithstanding some respecting more the satisfaction of their ambition, and
 others their private commodity, than just and upright dealing, procured divers
 ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Gentlemen, attending in divers several Rooms about the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
 to testifie with their hand-writings the Contents of the said pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Will,
 surmised to be signed with the King's own hand. To prove this dissembled and
 forged signed Testament, I do refer you to such Trials as be yet left. First;
 The Attestation of the late Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> published in the Parliament in
 Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, for the restitution of the Duke of
 <hi>Norfolk.</hi> Next, I pray you, on my Sovereigns behalf, that the
 Depositions may be taken in this Matter of the Marquess of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
 Lord Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the
 Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> Sir <hi>William Petre</hi> then one of King
 <hi>Henry</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries, Sir <hi>Henry Nevill,</hi> Sir <hi>Maurice
 Barkley,</hi> Doctor <hi>Buts, Edmond Harman Baker, Iohn Osborn</hi> Groom of
 the Chamber, Sir <hi>Anthony Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> if he be living, <hi>Terris</hi> the
 Chirurgion, and such as have heard <hi>David Vincent</hi> and others speak in
 this case; and that their Attestations may be enrolled in the
 <hi>Chancery,</hi> and in the <hi>Arches, In perpetuam rei me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi>; I do refer you to the Original Will surmised
 to be signed with the King's own hand, that thereby it may most clearly and
 evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear by some differences, how the same was not signed with the
 King's hand, but stamped as aforesaid. And albeit it is used both as an
 Argument and Calumniation against my Sovereign to some, that the said Original
 hath been embezelled in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, I trust God will and hath
 reserved the same to be an Instrument to relieve the Truth, and to confound
 false Surmises, that thereby the Right may take place, notwithstanding the many
 Exemplifications and Transcripts, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sealed with the great Seal, do
 run abroad in <hi>England,</hi> and do carry away many Mens minds, as great
 presumptions of great variety and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity. But, Sir, you know in cases of
 less importance, that the whole Realm of <hi>England,</hi> Transcripts and
 Exemplifications be not of so great force in Law to serve for the recovery of
 any thing, either real or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal: And in as much as my Soveraign's Title in
 this case shall be little <pb n="270" facs="tcp:104314:356"/> advanced, by taking exceptions
 to others pretended and crased Titles, considering her precedency, I will leave
 it to such as are to claim after the issue of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi>
 to lay in Bar the Poligamy of <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> the Duke of
 <hi>Suffolk</hi>; and also the vitiated and clandestine Contract, (if it may be
 so called) having no witness nor solemnization of Christian Matrimony, nor any
 lawful matching of the Earl of <hi>Hertford</hi> and the Lady <hi>Katharine.
 Lastly</hi>; The semblably compelling of Mr. <hi>Key,</hi> and the Lady
 <hi>Mary</hi> Sister to the Lady <hi>Katherine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, Sir, I have to answer your desire said somewhat
 brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Matter, which indeed is very little, where so much may be said;
 for to speak truly, the Cause speaketh for it self. I have so long forborn to
 deal in this matter, that I have almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten many things which may be
 said for Roboration of her Right, which I can shortly reduce to my Remembrance,
 being at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> where my Notes are: So that if you be not by this
 satisfied, upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg from you of any other Objection, I hope to satisfy
 you unto all things may be said against her. In the mean time I pray you so
 counsel the Queen, your Soveraign, as some effectual reparation may follow
 with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, of the many and sundry traverses and dis-favorings committed
 against the Queen, my Sovereign: as the publishing of so many exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications
 of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s supposed Will, the secret embracing of <hi>Iohn
 Halles</hi> Books, the Books printed and not avowed the last Summer, one of the
 which my Mistris hath sent by <hi>Henry Killigrew</hi> to the Queen your
 Soveraign; The Disputes and Proceedings of <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> where the
 Case was ruled against the Queen my Soveraign; The Speeches of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry in this
 last Session of Parliament, tending all to my Soveraigns de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision, and nothing
 said to the contrary by any Man, but the Matter shut up with silence, most to
 her prejudice; and by so much the more as every Man is gone home setled and
 confirmed in his Error. And, Lastly, The Queen, your Soveraign's resolution to
 defend now by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, all Books and Writings containing any discussion
 of Titles, when the whole Realm hath engendred by these fond proceedings, and
 other favoured practis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, a setled
 opinion against my Soveraigns, to the advancement of my Lady
 <hi>Katherines</hi> Title. I might also speak of an other Book lately printed
 and set abroad in this last Session, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Untruths and weak
 Reasons, which Mr. <hi>Wailing</hi> desired might be answered before the
 Defence were made by Proclamation. I trust you will so hold hand to the
 Reformation of all these things, as the Queen, my Soveraign, may have effectual
 occasion to esteem you her Friend; which doing, you shall never offend the
 Queen your Mistris, your Country, nor Conscience, but be a favourer of the
 Truth against Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and yet deserve well of a Princess, who hath a good
 heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize any good turn, when it is done her, and may hereafter have
 means to do you pleasure. For my particular, as I have always honoured you as
 my Father, so do I still remain of the same mind, as one, whom in all things
 not touching the State, you may direct, as your Son <hi>Thomas Cecil,</hi> and
 with my hearty commendations to you, and my Lady, both, I take my leave. </p>

               <p>THose who intend to write Romances or Plays, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly take
  their Plot from some true piece of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; in which they fasten such
  Characters to Persons and Things, and mix such Circumstances and secret
  Passages, with those publick Transactions and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that are in other
  Histories; as may more artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally raise these passions and affections in
  their Readers minds, which they intend to move, than could possibly be done, if
  the whole story were a meer fiction and contrivance: and tho all Men know those
  tender passages to flow only fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  the invention and fancy of the Poet; yet by I know not what char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the greatest part that read or hear
  their Poems, are softned and sensibly touched.</p>
               <p>Some such design <hi>Sanders</hi> seems to have had in his Book,
  which he very wisely kept up as long as he lived: he intended to represent the
  Reformation in the foulest shape that was possible, to defame Queen
  <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to stain her Blood, and thereby to bring her Title to the
  Crown in question; and to magnify the Authority of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
  and celebrate Monastick Orders, with all the praises and high characters he
  could devise: And therefore after he had writ several Books on these Subjects,
  without any considerable success, they being all rather filled with foul
  calumnies and detracting malice, than good Arguments, or strong sense, he
  resolved to try his skill another way; so he intended to tell a doleful Tale,
  which should raise a detestation of Heresie, an ill Opinion of the Queen, cast
  a stain on her Blood, and disparage her Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and advance the honour of the
  Papacy. A Tragedy was fitter for these ends, since it left the deepest
  impressions on the graver and better affections of the mind; the Scene must be
  laid in <hi>England,</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth and his three
  Children, with the changes that were in their times, seemed to afford very
  plentiful Matter for a Man of wit and fancy, who knew where he could dextrously
  shew his Art, and had boldness enough to do it without shame, or the reverence
  due, either to crowned Heads, or to Persons that were dead. Yet because he knew
  not how he could hold up his Face to the World, after these discoveries were
  made, which he had reason to expect, this was concealed as long as he lived:
  and after he had died <hi>for his Faith</hi> (that is, in Rebellion, which I
  shall shew is <hi>the Faith</hi> in his stile) this Work of his was published.
  The stile is generally clean, and things are told in an easy and pleasant way;
  only he could not use his Art so decently, as to restrain that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice which
  boiled in his Breast, and often fermented out too palpably in his Pen.</p>
               <p>The Book served many ends well, and so was generally much cried
  up, by Men who had been long accustomed to commend any thing that 
  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:104314:358"/> was useful to them, without troubling themselves with
  those impertinent Questions, whether they were true or false; yet
  <hi>Rishton</hi> and others since that time took the Pencil again in their
  hands, and finding there were many touches wanting, which would give much life
  to the whole Piece, have so changed it, that it was afterwards reprinted, not
  only with a large continuation, that was writ by a much more unskilful Poet,
  but with so many and great additions, scattered thorough the whole Work,
  whereby it seemed so changed in the vamping, that it looked new.</p>
               <p>If any will give themselves the trouble, to compare his Fable
  with the History that I have written, and the certain undoubted Authorities I
  bring in confirmation of what I assert, with the slender and (for the most
  part) no Authorities, he brings, they will soon be able to discern where the
  Truth lies: but because all People have not the leisure or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for
  laying things so critically together, I was advised, by those whose Counsels
  directed me in this whole Work, to sum up, in an <hi>Appendix,</hi> the most
  considerable Falshoods and Mistakes of that Book, with the Evidences upon which
  I rejected them. Therefore I have drawn out the following Extraction, which
  consists of Errors of two sorts. The one is, of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  information of our Affairs, but commits many Faults, which tho they leave not
  such foul imputations on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, yet tend very much to disparage and
  discredit his Work. But the others are of an higher guilt, being designed
  Forgeries, to serve partial ends; not only without any Authority, but
  manifestly contrary to Truth, and to such Records as (in spite of all the care
  they took in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s time by destroying them, to condemn Posterity
  to Ignorance in these Matters) are yet reserved, and serve to discover the
  falshood of those Calumnies in which they have traded so long. I shall pursue
  these Errors in the <hi>series</hi> in which they are delivered in
  <hi>Sanders</hi> his Book, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Impression at <hi>Colen</hi> 1628,
  which is that I have. I first set down his Errors, and then a short confutation
  of them, referring the Reader for fuller information to the foregoing
  History.</p>

  <hi>Sanders</hi> says; 
  <q>That when Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> and his Princess were bedded,
 King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi>th</hi> ordered a grave Matron to lie in the Bed,
 that so they might not consummate their Marriage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ground-work of the whole Fable; and should have been
  some-way or other proved. But if we do not take so small a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance upon
  his word, we treat him rudely; and who will write Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if they be bound
  to say nothing but Truth! But little thought our Author that there were three
  Depositions upon Record, point blank against this, for the Dutchess of
  <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Viscount of <hi>Fitswater</hi> and his Lady, deposed they
  saw them bedded together, and the Bed blessed after they two were put in it;
  besides that such an extravagant thing was never known done in any place.</p>

  <hi>Sanders</hi> says; 
  <q>Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> was not then fifteen years of Age, and
 was sick of a lingring Disease.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Plot goes on but scurvily, when the next thing that is
  brought to confirm it, is contradicted by Records. Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> was
  born the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> in the year 1486, and so was 15
  years old and two <pb n="275" facs="tcp:104314:358"/> months passed at the 14<hi>th</hi> of
  <hi>November</hi> 1501, in which he was married to the Princess, and was then
  of a lively and good Complexion, and did not begin to decay till the
  <hi>Shrovetide</hi> following, which was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his excesses in the Bed,
  at the Witnesses deposed.</p>

                  </note> 
                  <q>Upon the motion for the marrying of his Brother <hi>Henry</hi>
 to the Princess, it was agreed to by all, that the thing was lawful.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was perhaps agreed on at <hi>Rome,</hi> where Mony and other
  political Arts sway their Counsels; but it was not agreed to in
  <hi>England:</hi> for which we have no meaner Author, than <hi>Warham</hi>
  Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> who, when examined upon Oath, deposed that
  himself then thought the Marriage was not honourable nor well-pleasing to God,
  and that he had thereupon opposed it much, and that the People murmured at
  it.</p>

  <q>There was not one Man in any Nation under Heaven,<note place="margin">

 it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The common Stile of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> calling the See
  of <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> must be applied to this, to
  bring off our Author; otherwise I know not how to save his Reputation.
  Therefore by all <hi>the Nations under Heaven</hi> must be understood only the
  Divines at <hi>Rome,</hi> tho when it came to be examined, they could scarce
  find any who would justify it: all the most famous Universities, Divines, and
  Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, condemned it, and <hi>Warham</hi>'s Testimony contradicts this
  plainly, besides the other great Authorities that were brought against it, for
  which see <hi>lib.</hi> 2. from <hi>pag.</hi> 91. to <hi>pag.</hi> 103.</p>

               <p>Here is a pretty Essay of our Authors Art, who would make us

  Protestation, which he read himself before the Bishop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
  that he would never marry her, and that he revoked his consent given under Age.
  This was done when he came to be of Age, see <hi>pag.</hi> 36. it is also

               <p>All the Books of that time speak only of two Sons, and one

               </p>
               <p>It does not appear he had ever any but <hi>Elizabeth Blunt</hi>;
  and if we judge of his Life, by the Letters the Popes wrote to him, and many
  printed Elogies that were published then, he was a Prince of great Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and
  Religion all that while.</p>

                     <hi>Page</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <q>The Lady <hi>Mary</hi> was first desired in marriage by

 the 5<hi>th</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi>; and then <hi>Francis</hi> asked her,

                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:104314:359"/>But all this is wrong placed, for she was
  first contracted to the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> then to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and
  then treated about to the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; after that it was left to
  <hi>Francis</hi> his choice, whether she should be married to himself, or his
  second Son the Duke of <hi>Orleance:</hi> So little did our Poet know the

  <q>She was in the end contracted to the <hi>Dolphin:</hi> from
 whence he concludes that all Forreign Princes were satisfied with the
 lawfulness of the Marriage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>She was first of all contracted to the <hi>Dolphin.</hi>
  Forreign Princes were so little satisfied of the lawfulness of the Marriage,
  that tho she being Heir to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> was a Match of great
  advantage; yet their Counsellors excepted to it, on that very account, that the
  Marriage was not good. This was done in <hi>Spain,</hi> and she was rejected,
  as a Writer who lived in that time informs us; and <hi>Sanders</hi> confesses
  it was done by the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour.</p>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The order of these Preferments is quite reversed; for
  <hi>Wolsey</hi> soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was made Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> upon
  Cardinal <hi>Bembridge</hi> his death, was not only promoted to the See of
  <hi>York,</hi> but advanced to be a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the 7<hi>th</hi> year of the
  King's Reign: And some months after that, he was made Lord Chancellor; and
  seven years after that, he got the Bishoprick of <hi>Duresme,</hi> which six
  years after he exchanged for <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> He had heard perhaps that he
  enjoyed all these Preferments; but knowing nothing of our Affairs beyond
  hear-say, he resolved to make him rise as Poets order their <hi>Heroes</hi> by
  degrees, and therefore ranks his Advancement not according to Truth, but in the
  method he liked best himself.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This Story was already confuted, see <hi>pag.</hi> 41, 42. And
  in it there are more than one or two lies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sir <hi>Thomas Boleyn</hi> went not Ambassador to
  <hi>France</hi> till the 7<hi>th</hi> year of the King's Reign: And if two
  years after that, <hi>Ann</hi> was born, which was the 9<hi>th</hi> of his
  Reign, she must then have been but ten years old at this time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Tho he had sent him upon his first coming to the Crown,
  this could not be true; for two years after, admit her to be born, that is
  <hi>Anno</hi> 1511, then a year before this, which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1526, she
  was fifteen years old; in which Age, <hi>Sanders</hi> says, she was corrupted
  in her Father's House, and sent over to <hi>France,</hi> where she staid long.
  But all this is false: For,</p>
               <p n="3">3. She was born two years before the King came to the
  Crown, in the year 1507. and if her Father was sent to <hi>France</hi> two
  years before, it was in the year 1505.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The King being then Prince, was but fourteen years old,
  for he was born the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> in the year 1491: in which
  Age there is no reason to think he was so forward as to be corrupting other
  Mens Wives, for they will not allow his Brother, when almost two years elder,
  to have known his own Wife.</p>
               <p>As for the other pieces of this Story, that Sir <hi>Thomas
  Boleyn</hi> did sue his Lady in the Spiritual Court; that upon the King's
  sending him word that she was with Child by him, he passed it over; that the
  King had also known her Sister, and that she had owned it to the Queen, that at
  the fifteenth year of <hi>Ann</hi>'s Age, she had prostituted her self both to
  her Fathers Butler, and Chaplain; that then she was sent to <hi>France,</hi>
  where she was at first for some time concealed, then brought to Court, where
  she was so notoriously lewd, that she was called an <hi>Hackney</hi>; that she
  afterwards was kept by the <hi>French</hi> King; that when she came over into
  <hi>England,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat</hi> was admitted to base privacies with
  her, and offered to the King and his Council, that he himself should with his
  own Eyes see it: And in fine, that she was ugly, mishaped, and monstrous, are
  such an heap of impudent Lyes, that none but a Fool, as well as a Knave, would
  venture on such a recital. And for all <pb n="279" facs="tcp:104314:360"/> this, he cites no
  other Authority but <hi>Rastal</hi>'s Life of Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> a Book
  that was seen by none but himself; and he gives no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that there
  was any such Book but his own Authority. Nor is it likely that <hi>Rastal</hi>
  ever writ <hi>More</hi>'s Life, since he did not set it out with his Works,
  which he published in one Volume, <hi>Anno</hi> 1556. It is true,
  <hi>More</hi>'s Son in Law, <hi>Roper,</hi> writ his Life, which is since
  printed, but there is no such Story in it. The whole is such a piece of lying,
  as if he who forged it, had resolved to out-do all who had ever gone before
  him: for can it be so much as imagined, that a King could pursue a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign for
  seven years together, of marrying a Woman of so scandalous a Life, and so
  disagreeable a Person; and that he who was always in the other extream of
  Jealousie, did never try out these Reports, and would not so much as see what
  <hi>Wiat</hi> informed? Nor were these things published in the Libels that were
  printed at that time, either in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Court, or at <hi>Rome.</hi> All
  which shew that this was a desperate contrivance of Malicious Traitors, against
  their Soveraign Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> to defame and disgrace her. And this
  I take to be the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why none made any full answer to this Book all
  her time. It was not thought for the Queen's honour to let such Stuff be so
  much consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as to merit an answer. So that the 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18,
  <hi>pages</hi> are one continued Lye.</p>

                  <q>Sir <hi>Thomas Boleyn</hi> hearing the King intended to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
 his supposed Daughter, came over in all haste from <hi>France,</hi> to put him
 in mind that she was his own Child; and that the King bade him hold his peace
 for a Fool, for an hundred had lien with his Wife as well as he, but
 whosesoever Daughter she was, she should be his Wife: and upon that Sir
 <hi>Thomas</hi> instructed his Daughter how she should hold the King in her
 toils.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> must have thought the King had an ill
  memory, if he had forgot such a Story: but the one part of this makes him
  afraid that the King should marry his Daughter, and the other part makes him
  afraid they should miss their hopes in it: Not to mention how little likely it
  is, that a King of such high vanity, would have done that which the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

  know to be a common Prostitute.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:104314:361"/>Is it probable that the King would have
  made him Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, when he was so earnest in this business, if he had
  not known that he would have gone along with him in it. By one of his Letters
  to <hi>Cromwel</hi> out of the <hi>Tower</hi> it appears, that he approved the
  Divorce, and had great hopes of success in it, as long as it was prosecuted at
  <hi>Rome,</hi> and founded on the defects in the Bull. And in the 22<hi>d</hi>
  year of the King's Reign, when the Opinions of the Universities, and the Books
  of Learned Men were brought to <hi>England</hi> against the Marriage, he
  carried them down to the House of Commons, and made read them there; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
  which he desired they would report in their Country what they had heard and
  seen; and then all Men would openly perceive that the King had not attempted
  this matter of his Will and Pleasure, but only for the discharge of his
  Conscience. <hi>More</hi> was a Man of greater integrity than to have said
  this, if he had thought the Marriage good; so that he has either afterwards
  changed his mind, or did at this time dissemble too artificially with the
  King.</p>

  long flourish about the King's secret fears and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and the
  perplexities the Cardinal was in, which must pass for a piece of <hi>his
  Wit,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Lying,</hi> for he knew none of their thoughts;
  He says, 
  <q>That <hi>Gardiner</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Brian</hi> were

               </p>
               <p>In this there are only three gross mistakes. First,
  <hi>Gardiner</hi> was not sent with the first Message to the Pope, Secretary
  <hi>Knight</hi> carried it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sir <hi>Francis Brian</hi> went never to <hi>Rome</hi>
  with <hi>Gardiner:</hi> It is true, a year after the commencing the Sute, Sir
  <hi>Francis Brian</hi> was sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and about a month after him
  <hi>Gardiner</hi> was also sent; so tho they were both together at
  <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they were not sent thither together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Gardiner</hi> was not Secretary of State, but was
  <hi>Wolsey</hi>'s Secretary, when he went first to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was made

               </p>
               <p>This was on the contrary a contrivance of the Popes, who thought

  they had no hopes of it, and so always diverted the motion when it was proposed

                     </note> he had known <hi>Ann Boleyn</hi>'s Sister

               </p>
               <p>The falshood of this appears from the recital of it: And how
  came it that these Letters were not published? Nor is there any mention of this
  in all the Dispatches I have seen. And it is not possible that in so many
  conferences which the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadors had with the Pope, 
  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:104314:362"/> these two things should never have been discoursed of.
  And can it be thought credible that at the same time when the King pretended
  such scruples and troubles of Consciences, he could be guilty of so much folly
  and impudence, as to put himself thus in the Pope's Mercy, by two such demands.
  This was a forgery of Cardinal <hi>Pole</hi>'s, which <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>

               <p>This is said without any regard to Truth; for all the Matter of

  proved that Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> married the Queen: violent presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
  appeared of his consummating the Marriage: It was also proved that the King was
  under age when the Bull was obtained, and that the Petitions given in his Name,
  upon which the Bull was granted, were false: That the King had not desired it,
  but when he came of Age he had protested against it: And that there was no

  which was the chief reason set down in the Bull that permitted it. So that all

  that which was done by the Convocation two years before <hi>Cranmers</hi>
  preferment, nor was there any Oath taken then, or at this time. It is true, two
  years after this, <hi>Gardiner, Stokesley,</hi> and many other Bishops, did of
  their own accord take such an Oath; but there was no Law for it till the
  28<hi>th</hi> year of the King's Reign.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gardiner, Stokesly, Clark,</hi> and <hi>Longland,</hi> the
  Bishops of <hi>Winchester, London, Bath,</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> went with
  him. He could not hear the Queen, when she would not appear: but he examined
  all the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Evidences that had been brought in the whole
  Process.</p>
               <p n="60">60. He says; 
  <q>The Pope would not proceed against the King,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 75.</note> till he met with the <hi>French</hi> King
 at <hi>Marseilles:</hi> but that the <hi>English</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors did there
 carry so insolently, that <hi>Francis</hi> was ashamed of their behaviour; and
 desired the Pope to proceed against the King as he thought fit, and that he
 should never defend him more, but should be against him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Romance goes on too grosly, for the Pope and the
  <hi>French</hi> King agreed at <hi>Marseilles</hi> to bring this matter to an
  issue: the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he thought the King's Cause was just and right; and
  promised, if the King would send a full submission to <hi>Rome,</hi> he would
  give sentence in his favours: Upon which the <hi>French</hi> King sent over the
  Bishop of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> who prevailed with the King to do it; tho this
  afterwards came to nothing. It is true, <hi>Bonner</hi> who was always
  officious and forward when there was any thing to be got by it, being sent to
  <hi>Marseilles</hi> by the King, to deliver an Appeal in the King's Name to the
  Pope, to the next Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council; and perhaps knowing nothing of the private
  Transactions between the Pope and the <hi>French</hi> King, it being a Secret
  of too great importance to be communicated to such a hot-brain'd Man, did
  deliver his Message to the Pope in such provoking language, that the Pope
  talked of throwing him into a boiling Cauldron; and he was fain to fly for
  it.</p>

               <p>This was so precipitated, that they would not stay six days
  beyond the time which they prefixed, for the return of the Messenger that was
  sent to <hi>England:</hi> but dispatched that, which by the forms of their
  Court should have been done in three Consistories, all in one day.</p>
               <p n="62">62. He says; 
  <q>Upon this Sentence, the King being enraged,<note place="margin">

 be only called Princess, and declared her Daughter the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> a
 Bastard.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Both these were done five months before the Pope's Sentence, and
  soon after, the Sentence was pronounced by <hi>Cranmer.</hi> And these were the

  be longer a Queen, nor her Daughter Princess any more.</p>

               <p>Concerning this <hi>Forest,</hi> I have seen an Original Letter
  of one <hi>List</hi> a Frier of the same House, a year after this, that says
  <hi>Forest</hi> was a great scandal to their House, and was very ignorant: and
  that tho he had been much against the King in his Marriage, yet he had then
  insinuated himself into his favour, of which many of the House, who were for
  the King's Cause, had great apprehensions. In the same Letter he writes how
  cruel they were against any of their Brethren, who they thought discovered any
  thing that was done among them; and that one <hi>Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft,</hi> a Brother,
  whom they suspected to have informed what passed among them, was cruelly used,
  and kept in Prison till he died; which he chiefly imputes to <hi>Forest.</hi>
  This Friar swore the King's Supremacy, and yet at the same time was perswading
  others not to do it; and being questioned upon it, said, He took the Oath only
  with his Outward, but not with his Inward Man; and for that, and his denying
  the Gospel, he was burnt as an obstinate Heretick.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is a malacious Lye, for himself confessed that the King was

  between which, and the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> there were ten

  what he calls a publick Marriage, was only the shewing her openly as Queen. But

               <p>It was not given out that she was acted by a Fanatical Spirit,

  <hi>More</hi> cleared himself, and looked on her as a weak Woman, and commonly

               <p>The thing for which She and her Complices were attainted of

               <p>In this he is safer than in some other Stories, for the Journals

  it is not at all likely, that he who justified all that was done in the former
  Session, in which the Pope's Power was put down, the nomination of Bishops
  annexed to the Crown, a Reformation of Ecclesiastical Laws ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be
  made, in defence of all which he wrote afterwards, was now so scrupulous as to
  be ordered to stay at home. But <hi>Tonstal</hi> suffering im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment 
  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:104314:366"/> in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, it was fit to use

               <p>This bewrays palpable ignorance, since he was attainted of High
  Treason, the very day before the King's death, and should have suffered the
  next day, if the King's death had not prevented it. But since he will descant
  on the Providence of God, he should rather have concluded that his escaping so

               <p>How true this can be, the World may judg, since these two Kings
  continued in a firm Alliance eight years after this. And <hi>Francis</hi> did

               </p>
               <p>They did condemn the King's first marriage as unlawful, and
  thought the Pope's Dispensation had no force: and so far they approved it. But
  they had this singular Opinion, that he should have continued unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as
  long as Q. <hi>Katharine</hi> lived. Yet in that they were so modest that they
  only desired to be excused, as to the second Marriage: which considering that
  Queen <hi>Ann</hi> favoured their Doctrine, and that by an absolute compliance
  with what the King had done, they might have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his Protection to
  themselves, whom otherwise they provoked highly, is an evidence of a strict
  adhering to what their Consciences di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated, that cannot be sufficiently

  <q>The King made many write Apologies for what he did; which some
 did willingly, being tainted with Heresie, others unwillingly, and for fear, as
 <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Tonstall.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In this he shews how little judgment he had of the nature of
  things, when he thinks to excuse their writing for the King, as extorted by
  force: To have done it thorough Error and Mistake, was much the sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter excuse;
  but to make them Men of such prostituted Consciences, as not only to subscribe
  and swear, but to write with Learning and Zeal, and yet against their
  Consciences, represents them guilty of unexpressible baseness. Indeed
  <hi>Gardiner</hi> was a Man like enough to write any thing 
  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:104314:366"/> that might please the King; but <hi>Tonstall</hi> was a
  Man of greater probity, than to have done so unworthy a thing upon any account
  whatsoever. But since he mentioned Writers, he should have named
  <hi>Longland</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln, Stokeley</hi> Bishop of
  <hi>London,</hi> and above all <hi>Bonner,</hi> who did officiously thrust
  himself into the debate, by writing a Preface to <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi>'s Book,
  with the greatest vehemence that could be. But the Blood he shed afterwards did

               <p>There was no such Law made at that time, nor could any such Oath

               </p>
               <p>Every Body that knows the Law of <hi>England,</hi> will soon
  conclude this to be a Lye: for no such threatnings were ever made in Trials in
  this Nation. Nor was there any need at this time, for the Law was so plain, and
  their Facts so clearly proved, that the Jury could not refuse to bring them in
  guilty.</p>

  and in one place fourteen days together, with Irons about their Necks, Arms,
  and Legs, before they died: and then with great pomp he describes their Death
  in all its parts, as if it had been a new-devised cruelty, it being the Death
  which the Law appoints for Traitors. He tells, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> lamented
  that others of them had died in their Cells, and so prevented his cruelty. He
  also adds a long story of the severities against the <hi>Franciscans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this he drew from his learning in the Legend. The English
  Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion knows none of these Cruelties, in which the <hi>Spanish</hi>
  Inquisitors are very expert. I find, by some Original Letters, that the
  <hi>Carthusians</hi> who were shut up in their Cells, lived about a year after
  this; so if <hi>Cromwel</hi> had designed to take away their lives, he wanted
  not opportunities: but it appears from what <hi>More</hi> writ in his
  Imprisonment, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was not a cruel Man, but on the contrary,
  merciful and gentle. And for the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> tho they had offended
  the King highly, two of them railing spitefully at him to his Face, in his
  Chappel at <hi>Greenwich:</hi> Yet that was passed over with a Reproof, from
  which it appears that he was not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily provoked against them. So all that

  <hi>Sanders</hi> will let the World see how carefully he had read the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend,

  concerning <hi>More</hi>'s death; to whom I will deny none of the Praises due
  to his memory, for his great learning, and singular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity: nor had he any
  blemish, but what flowed from the Leaven of that cruel Religion, which carried
  him to great severities against those that preached for a Reformation. His
  Daughter <hi>Roper</hi> was a Woman of great Vertue, and worthy of such a
  Father, who needed none of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>'s Art to represent her well to the
  World. His Story is; 
  <q>That the morning her Father died, she went about distributing
 all the Mony she had in Alms to the Poor: and at last was at her Prayers in a
 Church, when of a sudden she remembred that she had forgot to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a
 Winding-sheet for his Body; but having no more Mony left, and not being well
 known in that place, she apprehended they would not give her credit: Yet she
 went to a Linnen-Drapers Shop, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for so much Cloth, she put her hand
 in her Pocket, knowing she had nothing in it, but intending to make an excuse,
 and try if they would trust her. But by a Miracle she found the price of the
 Sheet, and neither more nor less was conveighed into her Pocket.</q> This is

  that all the Evidence against her, was an hear-say of a Woman that was dead,
  the Confession of a poor Musician, and some idle words her self spake of the

               </p>
               <p>It seems this Author thought the giving these Elements of

               <p>This he put in out of malice, that he might annul the

  instead of their Oaths of Obedience to the Pope, which they formerly swore, did
  not swear to the King, there was no other change made; and that to be sure, is

               <p>This was indeed the motive by which their Seditious Priests

  Faith of Christ, which teaches us to be humble, subject, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; but
  because the King was removing some of the corruptions of that Faith, which

 home, hearing there was a meeting of the County at <hi>Wells,</hi> he went
 thither; and as he was going up to his place on the Bench, he was called to the
 Bar to answer some things that were to be objected to him: He was amazed at it,
 and asked what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was? but one told him, he needed fear nothing, for
 some-what was only to be done for form, to terrify others: Upon which he was
 condemned and sent away to his Abbey, little thinking he was so near his end;
 but when he came near it, a Priest was sent to him to take his Confession, for
 they told him he must die immediately; he beg'd a day or two's respite, but in

  to tell such tales of <hi>England,</hi> which is so famed over the World for

               <p>There was no such Law ever made, only the Parliament by their

  it. Nor was this first applied to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for an year before his

               <p>This is a Subject not fit to be long dwelt on: but if any will

  says; 
  <q>The King had promised to the Emperor, That he would no longer
 continue in the <hi>Smalcaldick</hi> League; but <hi>Cromwel</hi> counterfeited
 the King's Hand, to a new confirmation of it; which coming to the Emperor's
 knowledg, he challenged the King of it: and sent him over a Copy of it; upon
 which the King disowned it, and cast it on <hi>Cromwel</hi>; and that this was
 the cause of his fall.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This I believe is one of <hi>Sander</hi>'s dreams: there is not
  one word of it in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Attainder; nor do I find the least shadow
  of this in some Original Letters which he wrote to the King for his Pardon, in
  which he answers many of the things laid to his Charge. Nor is it likely he
  would adventure on so bold a thing, with such a King, nor could the Emperor
  have that Writing in his power, as long as the King lived: for it is not to be
  imagined how he could come by it, till he had taken the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>

  <q>The King sent to her, to tell her, he had a mind to be
 separated from her; and tho he could proceed more severely 
 <pb n="299" facs="tcp:104314:370"/> against her, since he knew she was an Heretick; yet for
 her Families sake, he left it to her self to devise any reason for their
 Divorce: upon which she came next day to the Senate, (which may be either the
 King's Council, or the Parliament) and confessed she had been married to
 another before she was married to the King; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by the Authority of
 Parliament, he was divorced, and within eight days married <hi>Katharine

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There are but six gross Errors in this Period. 1. The King sent
  not any message to her, nor came there any answer from her till the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
  of Divorce was quite passed. 2. In the Original Letter which those he sent to
  her, wrote to him from <hi>Richmond,</hi> it appears that they used no
  threatnings to her, but barely told her what was done; to which she acquiesced.
  3. She never came from <hi>Richmond</hi> in all that Process, and so made no
  such declaration in the Senate. 4. She did not say that she was married to
  another, but only that she had been contracted to the Prince of
  <hi>Lorrain</hi> when she was under Age. 5. The Parliament did not dissolve the
  Marriage, but only confirmed the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Convocation. 6. The King did
  not marry <hi>Katharine Howard</hi> before the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi>
  and the Divorce was judged the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> a month wanting

 the Goods of the Church, it came to nothing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is another Ornament of the Fable, to shew the Poet's wit;
  but is as void of Truth as any passage in <hi>Plantus</hi> or <hi>Terence</hi>
  is. For the King was all his life so intractable in that Point, that the Popish
  Party had no other way to maintain their Interest with him, but to comply, not
  without affectation in that Matter: and when an Information was given against
  <hi>Gardiner,</hi> for his holding some correspondence with the Pope's Legate
  at the Diet, he got the Man who had innocently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it, to be put in
  Prison; and said, it was a Plot against him to ruin him, which he needed not be
  so sollicitous about, if his Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the King had allowed him to
  enter on such a Treaty.</p>

                     <hi>Page</hi> 153.</note> upon the King's assuming the Title of
  King of <hi>Ireland</hi>; to shew that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> only hold
  <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Pope's Donation.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Sanders</hi> shews his Art, he being to carry the
  Standard of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in that Kingdom, to blast the King's Right to it. He
  acknowledges the Crown of <hi>England</hi> had the Dominion of
  <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Lord of Ireland,</hi> about 400 years:
  And certainly if so long a possession <pb n="300" facs="tcp:104314:371"/> does not give a
  good Title, and a prescription against all other Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, most of the Royal
  Families in Christendom will be to seek for their Rights. But he says, It was
  given by the Pope to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second; and yet he confesses that
  he had conquered some parts of it before that Grant was sent him by
  <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Fourth. Certainly King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second had as
  good a right to take it, as Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> had to give it: nor was the
  King's accepting the Pope's Donation, any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to his Title, for things
  extorted or allowed upon a publick Error, can have no force, when that is
  openly discovered. If then the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of those Ages, made, that the
  Pope's Donation was a great help to any Pretender, it was no wonder that Kings
  made use of it; but it were a wonder indeed if they should acknowledg it, after
  the Trick is known and seen by all.</p>

  <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> and a long enumeration of the exactions in the
  last years of this Reign; in which, tho there is Matter enough for severe
  complaints, yet many of the Particulars he mentions are without any proof, and
  must rest on the Author's credit; which by this time, the Reader will
  acknowledg is not very great. Another long discourse of some length follows, of
  the misfortunes of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and of all that served the
  King in his Divorce, and in the following Actions of his Life: from which he
  infers, that these were effects of a Cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e from Heaven upon all that he did, and on all those that assisted
  him: But as the Inference is bad, so he forgot to mention those Noble Families
  that were raised in his time, and have continued since in great honour; as the
  <hi>Seimours,</hi> from whom the Dukes of <hi>Somerset</hi> are descended; the
  <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,</hi> from whom the Marquess of <hi>Winchester</hi> derives; the
  <hi>Russels, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>othslies, Herberts, Riches,</hi> and <hi>Cromwells,</hi> from
  whom the Earls of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Southampton, Pembroke, Essex,</hi> and
  <hi>Ardglass</hi> have descended; and the <hi>Browns,</hi> the <hi>Petres,</hi>
  the <hi>Pagets,</hi> the <hi>Norths,</hi> and the <hi>Mountagues,</hi> from
  whom the Vice-Count <hi>Mountague,</hi> the Barons <hi>Petre, Paget,
  North,</hi> and <hi>Mountague,</hi> are descended. These Families have now
  flourished in great Wealth and Honour an Age and a half; and only one of them
  has, and that but very lately, determined in the Male Line: but the
  Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Female Branches of it are intermixed with other Noble Families. So
  that the Observation is false, and the Inference is weak.</p>

  says; 
  <q>When the King found his strength declining, he had again some
 thoughts of reconciling himself to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; which when it
 was proposed to one of the Bishops, he made a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering answer. But
 <hi>Gardiner</hi> moved that a Parliament might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for doing it: and
 that the King, for the quiet of his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, would vow to do it; of
 which God would accept in that extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when more was not possible to be
 done. But some of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers coming about him, who were very apprehensive
 of such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, lest they should have been made restore the Goods of
 the Church, diverted the King from it: And from this our Author infers, that
 what the King had done was against his Conscience, and that so he sinned the
 Sin against the Holy Ghost.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:104314:371"/>I shall not examine this Theological
  definition of the Sin against the Holy Ghost, for my quarrel is not at present
  with his Divinity, but with his History; tho it were easy to shew that he is
  alike at both. But for this story, it is a pure dream; for not only there is no
  evidence for it, nor did <hi>Gardiner</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>
  ever own any such thing, tho it had been then much for the credit of their
  Cause, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he being often upbraided with his compliances to this King,
  for which the mention of his repentance had furnished him with a good answer:
  But as the Tale is told, the Fiction appears too plainly, for a Parliament was
  actually sitting during the King's sickness, which was dissolved by his Death,
  and no such Proposition was made in it. The King on the contrary destroyed the
  chief hopes of the Popish Party, which were founded on the Duke of
  <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s greatness, by the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which was passed a day before
  he died. And yet <hi>Sanders</hi> makes this discourse to have been between the
  King and <hi>Gardiner</hi> after his fall, and his Sons death; between which,
  and the King's Death, there were only nine days: but besides all this,
  <hi>Gardiner</hi> had lost the King's favour a considerable time before his
  death.</p>

  <q>The King,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 166.</note> that he
 might not seem never to have done any good Work in his whole life, as he was
 dying, founded <hi>Christ's Church Hospital in London</hi>; which was all the
 restitution he ever made for the Monasteries and Churches he had robbed and
 spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If it had not already appeared, in many Instances, that our
  Author had as little shame as honesty, here is a sufficient proof of it. I will
  not undertake to justify the King, as if he had done what he ought to have
  done, in his new Foundations: But it is the height of impudence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things
  that all <hi>England</hi> knows. He founded six Bishopricks; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed Deans
  and Prebendaries, with all the other Offices belonging to a Cathedral, in
  fourteen several Sees, <hi>Canterbury, Winchester, Duresme, Ely, Norwich,
  Rochester, Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Carlisle</hi>; together with
  <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, Chester, Oxford, Glocester, Peterborough,</hi> and
  <hi>Bristol,</hi> where he endowed Bishopricks likewise. He founded many
  Grammar-Schools, as <hi>Burton, Canterbury, Coventry, Worcester,</hi> &amp;c.
  He founded and endowed <hi>Trinity Colledg</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> which is
  one of the noblest Foundations in Christendom. He also founded Professors in
  both Universities, for <hi>Greek, Hebrew, Law, Physick,</hi> and
  <hi>Divinity.</hi> What censure then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves our Author, for saying, that the
  Hospital of <hi>Christ's-Church,</hi> was all the restitution he ever made of

                  </note> which sutes very well with his History, his
  malice in it being extravagantly ridiculous. Among other things, he says, 
  <q>The King promoted always learned Bishops, <hi>Cranmer</hi>
 only being excepted, whom he advanced to serve his Lusts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cranmer</hi> was a Man of greater Learning, than any that
  ever sate in that See before him, as appears in every thing that he writ:
  <hi>Tonstal</hi> was a learned Man, and <hi>Gardiner</hi> was much esteemed for
  Learning; yet if any will compare <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Books of the Sacrament,
  with those the other two writ on the same Subject; there is so great a
  difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <pb n="302" facs="tcp:104314:372"/> the learning and solidity of the one

  says; 
  <q>The King by his Will appointed the Crown to go to his
 righteous Heirs after his three Children, and commanded his Son to be bred a
 true Catholick: but his Will was changed, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was forged, by which the
 Line of <hi>Scotland</hi> was excluded, and they bred his Son an
 Heretick.</q>

               <p>There was no such Will ever heard of; and in all the Debates
  that were managed in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign about the Succession,
  those that pleaded for the <hi>Scotish</hi> Line, never alleadged this; which
  had it been true, did put an end to the whole Controversie. It was indeed said,
  that the Will which was given out as the King's Will, was not signed by his
  Hand, nor sealed by his Order, but it was never pretended that there was any
  other Will: so this is one of our Author's Forgeries.</p>

                  <head>The Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>THus I have traced him in this History, and hope I have said
 much more than was necessary to prove him a Writer of no credit, and that his
 Book ought to have no Authority; since he was not only a stranger to the
 Publick Transactions, Printed Statutes, and the other Authentick Registers of
 that time, but was a bold and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Asserter of the grossest and most
 malicious Lies, that ever were contrived. I have not examined all the Errors of
 his Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, for there is scarce any thing told in its right order, and due
 place; nor have I insisted on all the passages he tells, without any proof, or
 appearance of truth; for as I could only deny these without any other evidence
 but what was negative, so there are so many of them, that I must have
 transcribed the greatest part of his Book, if I had considered them all. I have
 therefore only singled out these Passages, which I had in the former History
 demonstrated to be false: and these are both so many and so important, that I
 am sure, enough is said to destroy the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of that Author, and of his Book,
 which has too long deceived the the World. And what is performed in this first
 part, will I hope dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess the Reader of any ill Impressions the following
 parts of that Work have made on him, concerning the succeeding Reigns, of which
 an account shall be given, as soon as it possibly can be made ready.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:104314:372"/>I shall esteem my time to have been well
 imployed, and my pains rightly placed, if my endeavours have so good an effect,
 as to take off the unjust Prejudices which some may have conceived at the
 changes that were then made in Religion; or at the beginnings of them, which
 being represented by this Author, and upon his testimony by many other Writers,
 in such odious Characters to the World, are generally so ill looked on.</p>
                  <p>The Work it self was so good, done upon so much reason,
 managed with such care, directed by such wisdom, and tempered with so great
 moderation, that those who intended to blast it, did very wisely to load it
 with some such Prejudices: for if without these, the thing it self be examined
 by Men of a candid temper and solid judgment, the Opposers of it know well
 where the Truth lies; and on whose side, both the Scriptures, and the best Ages
 of the Primitive Church have declar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d. But it was not fit to put a Question of such importance, on so
 doubtful and so dangerous an issue: therefore it was well considered by them,
 that some popular and easily understood Calumnies, to disgrace the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
 of it, and the Persons that were most imployed in it, were to be fastned on
 them: and if these could be once generally received, then Men might be
 alienated from it by a shorter way, than could be done by the dull and
 unsuccessful methods of Reason. Therefore as the Cause of our Church hath been
 often vindicated, by the learned Books that have been published in it; and
 never with more success, and a clearer victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than of late, in the elaborate
 Writings (which are never to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned but with honour) of the renowned Dr.
 <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>; so I judged it might not be an unuseful and
 unacceptable Work (which tho it be of a lower form, and so most suitable to my
 genius, yet will be of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral use) to employ the leisure I enjoy, and the
 small Talent commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, in examining and opening the Transactions of
 those Times: And if these who read it, are dispossessed of their prejudices,
 and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to consider things as they are now set before them, in a truer
 light, I have gained my end in it.</p>
                  <p>The Truths of Religion need no support from the Father of
 Lyes. A Religion made up of Falshoods and Impostures, must be maintained by
 means suitable to it self: So <hi>Sanders</hi>'s Book might well serve the ends
 of that Church, which has all along raised its greatness by publick Cheats and
 Forgeries; such as the Donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and the Book of the
 <hi>Decretals</hi>; Besides the vast number of Miracles and Visions that were
 for many Ages made use of by them; of which even the most disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of
 their own Writers begin to be now ashamed. But the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion was
 a Work of Light, and needs none of the Arts of Darkness to justify it by. A
 full and distinct Narrative of what was then done, will be its Apology, as well
 as its History. There is no need of Artifice, but only of Industry, and
 sincerity to gather together all the remains of that Time, and put them in good
 order.</p>
                  <p>I am now beginning to look towards the next, and indeed the
 best part of this Work: Where in the first Reign, we shall observe the active 
 <pb n="304" facs="tcp:104314:373"/> endeavours of those Restorers of Religion. The next
 Reign affords a sadder prospect of that Work laid in Ruins, and the Authors of
 it in Ashes; but the Fires that consumed them, did rather spread than
 ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish that Light which they had kindled. And what is fabled of the
 <hi>Phoenix,</hi> will be found true of our Church, That she rose new out of
 these Ashes, into which she seemed consumed.</p>
                  <p>Towards the perfecting this History, I hope all that love the
 Subject of it, will contribute their Endeavours, and furnish every thing that
 is in their power, which may make it fuller or clearer: So I end with that
 desire which I made in the Preface, that any who have in their hands any Papers
 relating to these times, will be pleased to communicate them; and what-ever
 assistance they give to it, shall be most thankfully owned and
 acknowledged.</p>

  Amongst other cures committed unto this our Princely Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, whereunto it hath
  pleased God of his infinite mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to call us, we have always
  esteemed and thought (as we also yet esteem and think) this to be most chief,
  most ponderous, and of most weight, that his Holy Word and Commandments may
  sincerely without let or hinderance, be of our Subjects truly believed and
  reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently kept and observed; and that unity and concord in opinions, namely
  in such things as does concern our Religion, may encrease and go furthward, and
  all occasion of dissent and discord touching the same be repressed, and utterly
  extinguished; for the which cause we being of late to our great regret credibly
  advertised of such diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in opinions, as have grown and sprongen in this
  our Realm, as well concerning certain Articles necessary to our Salvation, as
  also touching certain honest and commendable Ceremonies, rites, and usages in
  our said Church, for an honest policy, and decent order heretofore of long time
  used and accustomed; minding to have that unity and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment established
  through our said Church concerning the premisses; and being very desirous to
  eschew not only the dangers of Souls, but also the outward inquietness which by
  occasion of the said diversity in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions (if remedy had not been provided)
  might perchance have ensued; have not only in our own person in any times taken
  great pain, study, labour and travails, but also have caused our Bishops and
  other the most discreet and best learned men of our Clergy of this our whole
  Realm to be assembled in our Convocation, for the full debatement and quiet
  determination of the same: where after long and mature deliberation and
  disputations, had of and upon the premisses, finally they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and

  necessary to our Salvation, as also the other touching the honest ceremonies,
  and good and politick order, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid; which their determination,
  debatement, and agreement, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as we think to have proceeded of a good,
  right and true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be agreeable to the Laws and Ordinances of
  God, and <pb n="306" facs="tcp:104314:374"/> much profitable for the establishment of that

  desire, we have caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same to be published, willing, requiring and
  commanding you to accept, repute, and take them accordingly; most heartily
  desiring and praying Almighty God, that it may please him so to illumin your
  hearts that you, and every of you, may have no less desire, zeal, and love to
  the said unity and concord, in reading, divulging, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same,

  be taken and understanden of you after such sort, order, and degree as
  appertaineth accordingly; We have caused by the like assent and agreement of
  our said Bishops and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Learned men, the said Articles to be divided into
  two sorts, that is to say, such as are commanded expresly by God, and are
  necessary to our Salvation, and such other, as although they be not expresly
  commanded of God, nor necessary to our Salvation; yet being of a long
  continuance for a decent order and honest policy, prudently instituted, are for
  that same purpose and end to be observed in like manner; which ye following,
  after such sort as we have prescribed unto you, shall not only attain that most
  charitable unity and loving concord, whereof shall ensue your incomparable
  commodity, profit and lucre, as well spiritual as other; but also ye conforming
  your selves, and using these our said Articles as is aforesaid, shall not a

 comprehended in the whole body and Canon of the Bible, and also in the three
 Creeds or Symbols, whereof one was made by the Apostles, and is the common
 Creed which every man useth, the second was made in the Holy Council of
 <hi>Nice,</hi> and is said daily in the Mass, and the third was made by

 Creeds to be so necessary to be believed for mans Salvation, that whosoever
 being taught will not believe them as is aforesaid, or will obstinately affirm
 the contrary of them, he or they cannot be the very members of Christ and his

 we will that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people
 committed by us unto their Spiritual Charge, that they ought and must of
 necessity believe certainly all those things, which hath been always by the
 whole consent of the Church approved, received and used in the Sacrament of
 Baptism; that is to say, that the Sacrament of Baptism was instituted and
 ordained in the New Testament by our Saviour Jesus Christ, as a thing necessary
 for the attaining of everlasting life, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the saying of Christ,
 <hi>Nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua &amp; Spiritu Sancto, non potest intrare
 in Regnum coelorum.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> that it is offered unto all men, as well
 Infants as such as have the use of Reason, that by Baptism they shall have
 remission of sins and the grace and favour of God, according to the saying of
 St. <hi>Iohn, Qui crediderit &amp; Baptizatus fuerit Salvus erit.</hi>

 which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is adjoyned unto the Sacrament of Baptism, pertaineth not only
 unto such as have the use of reason, but also to Infants, innocents and
 children; and they ought therefore and must needs be Baptised: and that by the
 Sacrament of Baptism they do also obtain remission of their sins, the grace and
 favour of God, and be made thereby the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sons and children of God, insomuch
 as Infants and Children dying in their Infancy shall undoubtedly be saved
 thereby, or else not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> that Infants must needs be Christened because
 they be born in Original sin, which sin must needs be remitted; which cannot be
 done but by the Sacrament of Baptism, whereby they receive the Holy-Ghost 
 <pb n="308" facs="tcp:104314:375"/> which exerciseth his Grace and efficacy in them, and
 cleanseth and purifieth them from sin by his most secret vertue and
 operation.</p>
                  <p>

 opinions in this behalfe, for detestable Heresies, and utterly to be

                     <hi>Item,</hi> that men or children having the use of reason,
 and willing and desiring to be Baptized, shall by the vertue of that holy

                  <p>
                     <hi>THirdly,</hi> Concerning the Sacrament of Pennance, We
 will that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people
 committed by us unto their Spiritual charge, that they ought and must most
 constantly believe, that that Sacrament was instituted of Christ in the New
 Testament as a thing so necessary for mans Salvation, that no man which after
 his Baptism is fallen again and hath committed deadly sin, can without the same
 be saved or attain everlasting Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> That like-as such men which after Baptism do
 fall again into sin, if they do not Pennance in this Life, shall undoubtedly be
 damned; even so whensoever the same men shall convert themselves from the said
 naughty Life, and do such Pennance for the same as Christ requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of them,
 they shall without doubt attain remission of their sins and shall be saved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> That this Sacrament of perfect Pennance which
 Christ requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <pb n="306" facs="tcp:104314:375"/> of such manner of persons, consisteth
 of three parts, that is to say, Contrition, Confession, with the amendment of
 the former Life, and a new obedient reconciliation unto the Laws and will of
 God, that is to say, exteriour Acts in works of Charity according as they be
 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, which be called in Scripture, <hi>fructus digni
 Paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, as touching Contrition which is the first part,
 We will that all Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
 committed by us unto their Spiritual charge, that the said Contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion consisteth in two special parts,
 which must always be conjoined together and cannot be dissevered; that is to
 say, the penitent and contrite man must first knowledg the filthiness and
 abomination of his own sin, whereunto he is brought by hearing and considering
 of the will of God declared in his Laws, and feeling and perceiving in his own
 conscience that God is angry and displeased with him for the same; he must also
 conceive not only great sorrow and inward shame that he hath so grievously
 offended God, but also great fear of Gods displeasure towards him, considering
 he hath no works or merits of his own which he may worthily lay before God as
 sufficient satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for his sins; which done then afterwards with this
 fear, shame and sorrow must needs succeed and be conjoyned, The second part,
 <hi>viz.</hi> a certain faith, trust and confidence of the mercy and goodness
 of God, whereby the penitent must conceive certain hope and faith that God will
 forgive him his sins, and repute him justified and of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Elect
 children, not for the worthiness of any merit or work done by the penitent, but
 for the only merits of the blood and passion of our Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> That this certain faith and hope is gotten and
 also confirmed, and made more strong by the applying of Christs words and
 promises of his grace and favour contained in his Gospel, and the Sacraments
 instituted by him in the new Testament; and therefore to attain this certain
 faith, the second part of Pennance is necessary, that is to say, Confession to
 a Priest if it may be had; for the Absolution given by the Priest was institute
 of Christ to apply the promises of Gods grace and favour to the Penitent.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore as touching Confession, We will that all Bishops and
 Preachers shall instruct and teach our people committed by us to their
 spiritual charge, that they ought and must certainly believe that the words of
 Absolution pronounced by the Priest, be spoken by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given to him
 by Christ in the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> That they ought and must give no less faith and
 credence to the same words of Absolution so pronounced by the Ministers of the
 Church, than they would give unto the very words and voyce of God himself if he
 should speak unto us out of Heaven, according to the saying of Christ,
 <hi>Quorum remiseritis peccata,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; qui vos audit me

 Confession which is made unto the Ministers of the Church, but that they ought 
 <pb n="310" facs="tcp:104314:376"/> to repute the same a verry expedient and necessary mean,

 consolation of their consciences.</p>
                  <p>As touching the third part of Penance, We will that all
 Bishops and Preachers shall instruct and teach our people committed by us to
 their spiritual charge, that although Christ and his death be the sufficient
 oblation, sacrifice, satisfaction, and recompence, for the which God the Father
 forgiveth and remitteth to all sinners not only their sin, but also Eternal
 pain due for the same; yet all men truly penitent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and confessed, must
 needs also bring forth the fruits of Penance, that is to say, Prayer, Fasting,
 Almsdeeds, and must make Restitution or Satisfaction in will and deed to their
 neighbour, in such things as they have done them wrong and injury in, and also
 must do all other good works of mercy and charity, and express their obedient
 will in the executing and fulfilling of Gods Commandments outwardly, when time,
 power and occasion shall be Ministred unto them, or else they shall never be
 saved; for this is the express precept and commandment of God, <hi>Agite
 fructus dignos paenitentia</hi>; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Debitores
 sumus,</hi> and in another place he saith, <hi>Castigo corpus meum &amp; in

                  <p>

 be ministred unto him so to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> That by Penance and such good works of the

 our people committed by us unto their spiritual charge, that this word
 Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification signifieth remission of our sins, and our acceptation or

 Contrition and Faith joyned with Charity, after such sort and manner as we
 before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and declared; not as though our Contrition, or Faith, or any
 works proceeding thereof can worthily merit or deserve to attain the said
 Justification; for the only mercy and grace of the Father, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised freely
 unto us for his Sons sake Jesus Christ, and the merits of his blood and his
 passion be the only sufficient and worthy causes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and yet that
 notwithstanding to the attaining of the said Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, God requireth to
 be in us not only inward Contrition, perfect Faith, and Charity, certain hope
 and confidence, with all other spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual graces and motions, which as we said
 before must necessarily concur in remission of our sins, that is to say, our
 Justification: but also he requireth and commandeth us, that after we be
 justified we must also have good works of charity and obedience towards God, in
 the observing and fulfilling outwardly of his Laws and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for
 although acceptation to everlasting life be conjoyned with Justification, yet
 our good works be necessarily required to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of everlasting Life,
 and we being justified be necessarily bound, and it is our necessary duty to do
 good works, according to the saying of St. <hi>Paul, debitores sumus non carni

                  <p>AS touching Images, truth it is that the same have been used
 in the old Testament, and also for the greater abuses of them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
 destroyed and put down, and in the new Testament they have been also allowed,
 as good Authors do declare; wherefore we will that all Bishops and Preachers
 shall instruct and teach our people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by us to their spiritual charge,
 how they ought and may use them. And <hi>First,</hi> that this may be
 attributed unto them that they be representers of vertue and good example, and
 that they also be by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion the kindlers and firers of mens minds, and make
 men often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and lament their sins and offences, especially the Images
 of Christ and our Lady; and that therefore it is meet that they should stand in
 the Churches, and none otherwise to be esteemed: And to the intent the rude
 people should not from henceforth take such superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in time past it
 is thought that the same hath used to do, we will that our Bishops and
 Preachers diligently shall teach them, and according to this Doctrine reform
 their abuses; for else there might fortune Idolatry to ensue, which God forbid.
 And as for Censing of them, and kneeling and offering unto them, with other
 like worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, although the same hath entred by devotion and fallen to
 cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome; yet the people ought to be diligently taught, that they in no ways do
 it, nor think it meet to be done to the same Images, but only to be done to God
 and in his honour, although it be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Images, whether it be of
 Christ, of the Cross, or of our Lady, or of any other Saint besides.</p>

 obtained but of God only by the mediation of our Saviour Christ, which is only

 Heaven everlastingly living, whose chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ever permanent, to be
 intercessors and to pray for us and with us unto Almighty God after this
 manner: All holy Angels and Saints in Heaven pray for us and with us unto the
 Father, that for his dear Son Jesus Christ's sake, we may have grace of him and
 remission of our sins, with an earnest purpose, not wanting Ghostly strength,
 to observe and keep his holy Commandments, and never to decline from the same
 again unto our lives end: And in this manner we may pray to our <hi>Blessed
 Lady,</hi> to St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> to all and every of the Apostles or
 any other Saint particularly, as our devotion doth serve us; so that it be done
 without any vain superstition, as to think that any Saint is more merciful, or
 will hear us sooner than Christ, or that any Saint doth serve for one thing
 more than another, or is Patron of the same. And likewise we must keep
 Holy-days unto God in memory of him and his Saints, upon such days as the
 Church hath Ordained their memories to be celebrated; except they be mitigated
 and moderated by the assent or commandment of the Supream head, to the
 Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and then the Subjects ought to obey it.</p>

 blood of Christ sprinkled for our redemption upon the Cross; Giving of holy
 bread to put us in remembrance of the Sacrament of the Altar, that all Christen
 men be one body mystical of Christ, as the bread is made of many grains and yet
 but one Loaf, and to put us in remembrance of the receiving the holy Sacrament
 and body of Christ, the which we ought to receive in right Charity; which in
 the beginning of Christs Church, men did more often receive than they use now
 adays to do; Bearing of Candles on <hi>Candlemas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> in memory of Christ
 the spiritual light, of whom <hi>Simeon</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie as is read in the
 Church that day; Giving of ashes on <hi>Ash-We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densday,</hi> to put in
 remembrance every Christen man in the beginning of Lent and Penance, that he is
 but ashes and earth and thereto shall return; which is right necessary to be
 uttered from henceforth in our mother-tongue always on the same day: Bearing of
 Palms on <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> in memory of receiving of Christ into
 <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a little before his death, that we may have the same desire
 to receive him into our hearts; Creeping to the Cross and humbling our selves

 Christ before the same, and kissing of it in memory of our Redemption by Christ
 made <pb n="314" facs="tcp:104314:379"/> upon the Cross; Setting up the Sepulture of Christ,

 cast away, but to be used and continued as things good and laudable, to put us
 in remembrance of those spiritual things that they do signifie, not suffering
 them to be forgotten, or to be put in oblivion, but renuing them in our
 memories from time to time; but none of these Ceremonies have Power to remit
 sin, but only to stir and lift up our minds unto God, by whom only our sins be

 very good and charitable deed to pray for Souls departed, and foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much also
 as such usage hath continued in the Church so many years even from the

 commit them in our prayers to Gods mercy, and also to cause others to pray for
 them in Masses, and Exequies, and to give Alms to others to pray for them,
 whereby they may be relieved and holpen, of some part of their pain: But
 forasmuch as the place where they be, the name thereof and kind of pains there,

 commend them, trusting that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth our prayers for them, referring the

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For the places alledged for the same be no
  Institutions but Acts and deeds of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> These Acts were done by a special gift given
  to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles for the confirmation of Gods Word at that time.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The said special gift doth not now remain with

               <p>
                  <hi>What is the External Sign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church useth <hi>Chrisma</hi> for the exterior sign, but the
  Scriptur maketh no mention thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the Efficacy of this Sacramint?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bishop in the name of the Church doth invocate the Holy
  Ghost to give strength and constancy, with other spiritual gifts, unto the
  person confirmed: so that the efficacy of this Sacrament is of such value, as
  is the Prayer of the Bishop made in the name of the Church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>To this I Answer,</hi> That the Words <hi>Signo te Signo
  Sanctae crucis &amp; confirmo te,</hi> &amp;c. With the consignation, with the
  Creame, imposition of hands of the Prelates, be the Signs: and the increase of

                  <hi>The third Question,</hi> What promises
  be made of the said graces?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Answer,</hi> That the facts and deeds that be expressed in
  the Books of the Apostles, with the effects ensuing, by the imposition of their
  hands, upon them that before had received Remission of their sins, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with
  the promises of Christ, made to his Church, and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al belief of the
  university of the same Catholick Church from the time of the Apostles hitherto,
  without contradiction of any man (igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and suspects of Heresie only
  excepted) maketh us, and in my opinion, without prejudice of other mens
  opinions, ought to suffice to make all men that hath promised to believe the
  Catholick Church, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly to think that God hath made the promises of the

               <head>IV. Some Considerations offered to the King by
  <hi>Cranmer,</hi> to Induce him to proceed to a further Reformation.</head>
               <p>PLeaseth it your Highness graciously to consider,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cott.</hi> Libr. <hi>Cleop.</hi> E. 4.</note> deeply to
  pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and weigh by your high wisdom these Considerations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> How no great thing is to be determined,
  principally matters of Christs Religion, without long, great, and mature
  deliberation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> How evil it hath succeeded when in
  Provincial, yea or yet in General Councils, men have gone about to set forth
  any thing as in the force of Gods Law, without the manifest Word of God, or
  else without apparent reasons, infallibly deduced out of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How all Christened Regions are now full of
  Learned men in the Scripture, which can well espie out and judge how things
  that be, or shall be set forth are agreeable with Scripture or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Of what Audacity men be of now adays, which
  will not spare to write against high Princes, as well as against private
  per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, without any respect to their high Estates, only weighing the equity
  or the iniquity of the cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> How not only men of the New Learning (as they
  be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) but also the very Papistical Authors, do allow that by the Word of
  God, Priests be not forbidden to Marry, although they were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that
  many expounders of Scripture were of the contrary judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> How that it is not possible that all Learned
  men should be <pb n="320" facs="tcp:104314:382"/> of one mind, sentence, and opinion, as
  long as the cockle is mingled with the wheat, the Godly with the ungodly, which
  certainly shall be as long as the World endureth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> How variety of Opinions have been occasion
  of the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many verities heretofore taken for Heresie, yea and yet so
  esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken of many, in other Regions; as namely the usurped Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
  of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath by that occasion come into Light, with the
  effusion of the blood not of a few, such as were the first stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers up
  thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> There be also other opinions not spoken of,
  which have made, and yet will make as much variance in your Graces Realm as any
  of them treated of, namely, Whether the Holy Scripture teacheth any Purgatory
  to us after this Life or not? whether the same Scripture teacheth the
  Invocation of dead Saints? Whether there be any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written verities necessary
  to be believed not written in Scripture, nor deducted by infallible Arguments
  out of the open places of Scripture? Whether there be any satisfactions beside
  the satisfaction of Christ? Whether free will by its own strength may dispose
  it self to grace of a conveniency (as it is said) <hi>de congruo</hi>? Whether
  it be against Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to kiss the Image of Christ in the Honour of him? And
  general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether Images may be used any other way than your Grace set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
  forth in your Injunctions?</p>
               <p>Wherefore in consideration of the premisses it may please your
  High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to suspend your judgment for a time, and not to determine the
  Marriage of Priests to be against Scripture, but rather to put both parts to
  silence, commanding them neither to preach, dispute, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to talk
  thereof under pain of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in case these premisses do not move
  your Highness to stay, that then it may please the same to grant that the
  Article of Priests Marriage may be openly disputed in both Universities, under
  indifferent Judges, before it be determined. All the Arguments of the contrary
  party first to be delivered in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the defenders twelve days before the
  disputation; to the intent they may the more maturely and deliberately make
  answer to the same; and they that shall enter as defenders into this
  disputation, to do it under this condition, that if their Judges decern them to
  be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, they be right well contented to suffer death, therefore: And if
  their adversaries cannot prove their purpose, their desire is no more but that
  it may please your Highness to leave your most humble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the liberty
  that Gods Word permitteth them in that behalf; and your said humble Subjects
  shall pray unto Almighty God for the preservation of your most Royal Estate
  long to continue to Gods Glory and Honour.</p>

               <p>AS touching the Sacrament of Holy Orders, we will that all

                     </gap>.</note> How that Christ and his
  Apostles did institute and Ordain in the New Testament, that beside the Civil
  Powers and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Kings and Princes, which is called in Scripture,
  <hi>pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stas gladij,</hi> the Power of the Sword, there should be also
  continually in the Church Militant, certain other Ministers or Officers, which
  should have Spiritual Power, Authority and commission under Christ, to Preach
  and teach the Word of God, unto his people, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and administer the
  Sacraments of God unto them; and by the same to confer and give the grace of
  the Holy Ghost, to consecrate the blessed body of Christ in the Sacrament of
  the Altar, to loose and absoil from sin, all persons which be duly penitent and
  sorry for the same; to bind and excommunicate such as be guilty in manifest
  crimes and sins, and will not amend their defaults; to order and consecrate
  others in the same room, Order and Office, whereunto they be called and
  admitted themselves; and finally to feed Christs people like good Pastors, and
  Rectors, as the Apostles calleth them, with their whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some doctrine, and by
  their continual exhortations and monitions to reduce them from sin and
  iniquity, so much as in them lyeth, and to bring them unto the perfect
  knowledg, the perfect love and dread of God, and unto the perfect charity of
  their neighbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> that this Office, this Ministration, this Power
  and Authority is no tyrannical Power, having no certain Laws or Limits, within
  the which it ought to be contained, nor yet none absolute Power, but it is a
  moderate Power, subject, determined, and restrained unto those certain Limits
  and ends for the which the same was appointed by Gods Ordinance; which, as was
  said before, is only to administer and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute unto the members of Christs
  Mystical body, spiritual and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting things; that is to say, the pure and
  heavenly doctrine of Christs Gospel, and the graces conferred in his
  Sacraments: And therefore this said Power and administration is called in some
  places of Scripture, <hi>donum &amp; Gratia,</hi> a gift and a grace; in some
  places it is called <hi>Claves sive potestas clavium,</hi> that is to say, the
  keys or the Power of the keys, whereby is signified a certain limited Office
  restrained unto the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a special Function or Ministration, according
  to the saying of <pb n="322" facs="tcp:104314:383"/> St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his first Chap. of
  his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in the fourth Chap. of his first
  Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and also in the fourth Chap. of his Epistle to the
  <hi>Ephes.</hi> Where he writes in this Sentence; <hi>Quum ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disset

                     </gap>m fidei &amp; agnitionis filii Dei, in
  virum perfectum, in mensuram aetatis plene adultae Christi.</hi> That is to
  say, 
  <q>when Christ as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heaven, he subdued and vanquished
 very captivity her self, and led or made her thrall and captive, and
 distributed and gave divers heavenly gifts and graces unto men here on earth;
 and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all he made some the Apostles, some Priests, some Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, some
 Pastors and Doctors, to the intent they should execute the work and office of
 their administration, to the instauration, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and edifying of the
 members of Christs Mystical body: And that they should also not cease from the
 Execution of their said Office, until all the said members were not only
 reduced and brought unto unity of the Faith, and the knowledg of the Son of
 God, but also that they were come unto a perfect state, and full age therein;
 that is to say, until they were so established and confirmed in the same that
 they could no more afterwards be wavering therein, and be led or carryed like
 children, into any contrary doctrine, or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the craft or subtile
 perswasion of the false Pastors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which go about by craft to bring
 them into erroneous opinions, but that they should constantly follow the true
 Doctrine of Christs Gospel, growing and encreasing continually by charity unto
 a perfect member of that body, whereof Christ is the very head, in whom if the
 whole body, that is to say, if every part and member be grown and come unto his
 perfect estate, not all in like, but only one according to the gift and quality
 which is deputed unto it, and so to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, united, and corporated
 together in the said body, no doubt bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that whole body and every part thereof shall thereby be made

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he more perfect and the more
 strong, by reason of that natural love and charity, which one member so united
 in the body hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other:</q> by which words it appeareth evidently not
  only that St <hi>Paul</hi> accounted and numbred this said Power and Office of
  the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Doctors among the proper and special gifts of the Holy Ghost,
  but also it appeareth that the same was a limited power and Office, ordained
  specially and only for the causes and purposes before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> That this Power, Office, and Administration is
  necessary to be preserved here in Earth for three special and principal causes.
  <hi>First,</hi> for that it is the Commandment of God it should be so, as it
  appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in sundry places of Scripture. <hi>Secondly,</hi> for that God hath
  insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and ordained none other ordinary mean or instrument, whereby he
  will make us partakers of the reconciliation which is by Christ, and confer and
  give the graces of his holy Spirit unto us, and make us the right inheritors of
  everlasting Life, there to Reign with him for <pb n="323" facs="tcp:104314:383"/> ever in
  glory, but only his words and Sacraments; and therefore the Office and Power to
  Minister the said Word and Sacraments, may in no wise be suffered to perish, or
  to be abolished, according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. <hi>Paul, Quomodo credent in
  eum de quo non audi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>runt? quomodo
  autem audient sine praedicante? quomodo autem praedicabunt nisi missi fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt?
  sicut scriptum est, quam specios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
  super montes pedes Evangelizanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um pacem, annunciantium bona! Thirdly,</hi>
  because the said Power and Office or Function hath annexed unto it assured
  promises of excellent and inestimable things; for thereby is conferred and
  given the Holy Ghost with all his graces, and finally our justification and
  everlasting life, according to the saying of St. <hi>Paul, Non me p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>det Evangelii Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su Christi, potentia
  siquidem est Dei ad salutem omni credenti</hi>; that is to say, I am not
  ashamed of the room and Office which I have given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me by Christ, to preach
  his Gospel, for it is the Power of God, that is to say, the elect Organ or
  instrument ordained by God and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with such vertue and efficacy, that it
  is able to give and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster effectually everlasting Life unto all those that
  will believe and obey unto the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> That this Office, this Power and Authority was
  committed and given by Christ and his Apostles unto certain persons only, that
  is to say, unto Priests or Bishops, whom they did elect, call, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
  thereunto by their Prayer and Imposition of their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We will that all Bishops and Preachers shall
  instruct and teach our people committed unto their Spiritual charge, that the
  Sacrament of Order may worthily be called a Sacrament, because it is a holy
  Rite or ceremony instituted by Christ and his Apostles in the New Testament,
  and doth consist of two parts, like as the other Sacraments of the Church do;
  that is to say, of a spiritual and an invisible grace, and also of an outward
  and a visible Sign. The invisible gift or grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in this Sacrament,
  is nothing else but the Power, the Office and the Authority before mentioned:
  the visible and outward Sign, is, the Prayer and Imposition of the Bishops
  hands, upon the person which receiveth the said gift or grace. And to the
  intent the Church of Christ should never be destituted of such Ministers, as
  should have and execute the said power of the keys, it was also Ordained and
  com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Apostles, that the same Sacrament should be applyed and
  ministred by the Bishop from time to time, unto such other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as had the
  qualities, which the Apostles very diligently descryve; as it appeareth
  evidently in the third <hi>Chap.</hi> of the first Epistle of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
  to <hi>Tim.</hi> and his Epistle unto <hi>Titus.</hi> And surely this is the
  whole ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacy, and the cause also of the institution of this
  Sacrament, as it is found in the New Testament; for albeit the Holy Fathers of
  the Church which succeeded the Apostles, minding to beautifie and ornate the
  Church of Christ with all those things, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in the Temple
  of the <hi>Iews,</hi> did devise not only certain other ceremonies than be
  before rehearsed, as Tonsures, Rasures, Unctions, and such other observances to
  be used in the administration of the said Sacraments, but did also institute
  certain inferiour orders or degre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, as <hi>Ianitors, Lectors, Exorcists, Acolits,</hi> and
  <hi>Subdeacons,</hi> and deputed <pb n="324" facs="tcp:104314:384"/> to every one of those
  certain Offices to Execute in the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they followed undoubtedly
  the example and rites used in the Old Testament; yet the truth is, that in the
  New Testament there is no mention made of any degrees or distinctions in
  Orders, but only of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons or Ministers, and of Priests or Bishops: nor there
  is any word spoken of any other ceremony used in the conferring of this
  Sacrament, but only of Prayer, and the Imposition of the Bishops hands.</p>

  caeteras laudes: hinc enim propagata est doctrina Christiana in magnam
  Germaniae &amp; Galliae partem; imo Britannicae Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae beneficium fuit,
  quod primum Romanae Provinciae liberatae sunt persecutione. Haec primum nobis
  Imperatorem pium Constantinum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: magna haec gloria est vestri nominis.
  Nunc quoque Regia Majestas tua, primum heroica magnitudine animi ostendit se
  veritati patrocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum esse, excussit Romani Episcopi tyrannidem, quare
  veterem puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem Ecclesiae vestrae maxime optarim restitui integram. Sed
  animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verto istic esse quosdam qui veteres abusus ortos aut confirmatos a
  Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano Episcopo adhuc mordicus tenent. Mirum est autem Autore abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suum ejecto
  ipsa tamen venena retineri; qua in re illud etiam periculi est, quod illi ipsi
  aut eorum imitatores aliquando revocaturi potestatem Romani Episcopi videntur,
  si populus hunc putavit esse Magistrum Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiarum, incurrunt enim ritus in
  oculos &amp; admonent de autore, ut So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonis memoria cum legibus Athenis &amp;
  propagata &amp; jucunda fuit.</p>
               <p>Gaudebam igitur in Edicto recens istic proposito de Religione,
  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitti publicam deliberationem &amp; emendationem de Ecclesiarum ritibus
  &amp; legibus, eaque sententia mitigavit Decreti acerbitatem: quanquam enim
  laudo pietatem, quod errores prohibentur, qui pugnant cum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina Catholicae
  Ecclesiae quam &amp; nos profitemur; tamen doleo ad eas causas adjectum esse
  articulum, in quo praecipitur omnium rituum usita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum &amp; caelibatus
  observatio. Primum enim multi transferent Edicti Autoritatem ad stabiliendos
  abusus Missae. Deinde in universum confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur pertinacia eorum qui Doctrinae
  nostrae sunt iniquiores, &amp; debilitantur studia piorum. Augustinus queritur
  sua aetate jam duriorem fuisse ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitutem Christianam quam Judaicam, quanto
  erit asperior servitus, si superstitiosiores ineptiae, ut reptatio ad crucem
  aut res similes, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientur corporum suppliciis? Gerson scribit prodesse piis,
  qui tamen superstitiosius observant ritus, ut invitentur ad eos violandos, ut
  usu &amp; exemplo dediscant superstitionem.</p>
               <p>Sed munio tranquillitatem, dices, &amp; nolo dissimilitudine
  rituum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citari discordias. Ego de piis &amp; modestis loquor qui humanas
  traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes sine tumultibus violant, non de his qui in caetu publico seditiose
  tranquillum populum aut concitant aut perturbant. Extant autem antea leges de
  seditiosis, nec statim violatio inepti &amp; non necessarii ritus judicanda est
  seditiosa, attamen hac in re non solum tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, <pb n="303" facs="tcp:104314:385"/>
  sed etiam piarum conscientiarum ratio habenda est: est enim tenera res
  conscientia, facile languescit perculsa potentum judiciis.</p>
               <p>Nec ignoro quosdam novo jam uti genere sapientiae, excusant
  abusus, &amp; leniunt eos astute affictis interpretationibus, ut habeant
  speciosam causam cur eos retineant; sicut nefarios abusus excusat Autor
  reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis Coloniensis, ut campanarum consecrationem &amp; similes
  imposturas. Quam multa sunt in fabulosis historiis sanctorum, ut Christophori,

  Ordinationibus res indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes constituendi; &amp; rationes illae vel de
  discrimine ordinum, seu dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate Sacerdotali, vel periculo effusionis &amp;
  similes, nullo modo tantam queunt vim habere, ut propterea Divinae Ordinationes
  mutandae sint; neque ulla etiam consuetudo contra mandata Dei introducta, ipsis
  canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Pontificiis attestantibus, probanda est. Constat vero usum
  utrius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que speciei, &amp; clarum habere mandatum Christi, &amp; adprobationem
  San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum Patrum, ac consuetudinem veteris Ecclesiae; sic enim, inquit Divus
  Hieronymus, Sacerdotes qui Eucharistiae serviunt, &amp; sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Christi
  populis distribuunt: &amp; Gelasius Pontifex, Sacramenti Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris &amp;
  Sanguinis Domini divisionem prohibet, eamque grande Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium adpellat.</p>
               <p>Adhaec, durat hodie hic mos Communionis utriusque speciei in
  Graecis Ecclesiis, quae hac in re Romani Pontificis tyrannidi semper
  restiterunt, neque ejus jugum recipere voluerunt, &amp; testantur Historiae tum
  in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania, tum in multis aliis regionibus ac provinciis, verum Communio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
  usum diu conservatum fuisse, sed tandem fulminibus Romani Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christi, quibus
  totum paene orbem terrarum conterruit &amp; subjugavit, homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ut verisimile
  est, victi, veru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eucharistiae usum mutarunt, ad quem tamen, per singularem Dei
  Gratiam, agnita iterum veritate Evangelica, cum Principes nostri, tum alii
  Evangelii Doctrinam profitentes, jam redie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, &amp; sese ac suos in re
  Universae Ecclesiae maxime salutifera, tanquam in libertatem, excusso jugo
  Pontificio, vendicarunt &amp; adseruerunt. Nam quae causae Pontificem
  permoverint, ut contra Christi mandatum &amp; institutum, contra sententiam
  Sanctorum Patrum, contra consuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem Universae Ecclesiae Christianae,
  Sacramentum divideret, &amp; Laicos Sanguine Domini nefarie spoliaret, facile
  Serenissima Regia Majestas Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra perspicit. Verisimile quidem videtur, eum
  voluisse suam, suique ordinis auctoritatem ac dignitatem, ea ratione augere,
  &amp; hoc discrimen inter Laicos &amp; Sacerdotes constituere; nam etiam nunc
  clamitant adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarii, laicos debere esse altera specie contentos; quasi regnum
  aliquod possideant, &amp; ita imperare ipsis liberum sit, ut etiam Christi
  beneficium hominibus eripere queant, ad quod potius, si suo officio fungi
  vellent, omnes invitare &amp; pellicere deberent. Sed quid Christo cum Belial?
  quid Pontifici cum Christi instituto, cujus ipse se summum adversarium 
  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:104314:387"/> esse satis declarat, ideoque tum in hoc, tum aliis
  salutaribus Religionis Christianae Articulis oportuit ipsum a scriptura
  discedere, imo Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Evangelio consentaneam damnare, ut manifestum fieret,
  eum esse Antichristum, de quo passim Scriptura talia praedixit.</p>
               <p>Porro in altero Articulo, De Missa Privata,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Missa privatae.</hi>
                  </note> adhuc magis adparet a Romano
  Pontifice Religionem Christianam adeo oppressam &amp; obscura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, ut Christi
  Beneficium qui sua morte nos redemit, solusque est ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia &amp; satisfactio
  pro peccatis nostris, penitus sustulerit, &amp; in ejus lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum idololatricum
  cultum pro abolendis peccatis in Ecclesiam invexerit, eamque suis erroribus
  &amp; prophanationibus miserabiliter implicaverit, turbaverit &amp;
  deformaverit. Cum enim Missa nihil aliud sit, nec esse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat, quam communio
  sive Synaxis, ut Paulus adpellat, neque etiam alius ejus usus fuerit tempore
  Apostolorum &amp; veteris Ecclesiae, quemad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum hoc clare ex S. Patribus
  probari potest, plane diversum quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam opus, prorsus pugnans cum communione
  &amp; vero Missae usu inde factum est, quod docent ex opere operato, ut
  loquuntur, mereri grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, &amp; tollere peccata vivorum &amp; mortuorum.</p>
               <p>Haec opinio quantopere distet a Scripturis, ac gloriam Passionis
  Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti laedat, Sereniss. Regia Majestas Vestra facillime judicabit. Si enim
  hoc verum est, quod Missa pro aliis applicari potest, quod peccata tollit,
  &amp; prodest tam vivis quam mortuis, sequitur Justificationem ex opere
  Missarum contingere non ex fide; verum hoc omnino Scripturae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnat, quae
  tradit nos gratis propter Christum per fidem justificari, ac peccata nobis
  condonari, &amp; in gratiam nos recipi, atque ita non alieno opere, sed propria
  fide propter Christum, singulos justos

  remissionem venialium &amp; mortalium peccatorum culpae &amp; poenae; idque
  aperte ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versari Scripturae, &amp; a vero usu Missae sive communionis longe
  disce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, vel inde liquet, quia Missa sive Synaxis ideo est instituta, ut
  fides Lis qui utitur Sacramento recordetur quae beneficia accipiat per
  Christum, &amp; erigat ac soletur pavidam conscientiam; ideoque ibi por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigi
  debet Sacramentum, his quibus opus est consolatione, sicut Ambrosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ait, quia
  semper pecco, semper debeo accipere Medicinam. Atque hic usque ad tempora
  Gregorii in Ecclesia Missae usus fuit, neque antea privatae Missae cognitae
  fuerunt; quod quidem cum multis aliis Patrum Sententiis patet, tum Chrysostomi,
  qui inquit, Sacerdotem stare ad al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare &amp; alios ad Communionem accersere,
  alios arcere: Et ex veteribus Canonibus constat, unum aliquem celebrasse
  Missam, a quo reliqui Presbyteri &amp; Diaconi sumpserunt corpus Domini, sic
  enim inquit Canon Nicenus, Accipiant Diaconi secundum Ordinem post Presbyteros
  ab Episcopo vel Presbytero, Sacram Communionem. Et scribit Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, in Asia
  Synaxim ter celebratam singulis septimanis, nec quotidianas fuisse Missas,
  eumque morem ab Apostolis traditum esse; qui quidem Missae usus etiam hodie in
  Graecis Parochiis durare dicitur, nam tantum singulis dominicis diebus &amp;
  festis, fit ibi una publica Missa, privatas vero <pb n="336" facs="tcp:104314:388"/> non
  habent: fuitque Graeca Ecclesia hoc nomine longe foelicior quam Latina, quae
  meliorem usum coenae Domini, Synaxis, sive Missae reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuerit, neque vel
  Sacramentum Corporis &amp; Sanguinis Domini, contra claram Evangelii Doctrinam
  diviserit, ut paulo ante diximus, neque etiam privatas Missas Sacrae Scripturae
  acerrime repugnantes, receperit; cujus quidem rei hanc potentissimam causam
  fuisse arbitramur, quod Graeca Ecclesia Romanum Episcopum auctorem perversae
  &amp; Idololatricae Doctrinae, &amp; omnium poene abusuum qui in Ecclesiam
  introducti sunt, pro summo Ecclesiae Universalis sive Catholicae capite,
  nunquam ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noverit.</p>
               <p>Sed concedunt quidam adplicationes quae f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>unt in Missa pro vivis &amp; mortuis, &amp; item
  opiniones, quod ex opere operato gratiam mereri tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur, non esse probandas,
  &amp; disputant abolitis illis opinionibus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piis, alia ratione Missas
  privatas retinendas, nempe quia sunt gratiarum actiones, quae possint ab uno
  vel a pluribus fieri. Haec sane ratio videtur aliquam habere speciem, estque
  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ut inquit Sophocles, quo in causis invalidis, &amp; ut
  ipse ait, morbidis utendum sit. Si Missa tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum esset gratiarum actio, possit
  fortassis tali aliquo praetextu colorari; verum constat eam principaliter
  institutam esse, ut sit Sacramentum quod per ministrum alteri exhibeatur, ut
  accipiens &amp; credens consequatur gratiam. Et hoc quidem principali fine
  posito, accedit alter de gratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum actione; quare nullo modo ab institutione
  Christi recedere, sed modum &amp; formam illius Institutionis, &amp; exemplum
  veteris Ecclesiae sequi &amp; retinere debemus: Nulla enim novitas, praesertim
  in Sacramentis, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipienda est, contra formam a Christo traditam, &amp; contra
  exempla vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Ecclesiae.</p>
               <p>Porro constat privatas Missas esse recentes, &amp; a Romanis
  Pontificibus introductas, &amp; ne hodie quidem, ut paulo ante dictum est, in
  Graecis Ecclesiis esse, nisi Parochiales diebus festis, cum quibus adhuc manet
  ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigium Communionis: Cum igitur contra Dei Verbum Missa privata in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducta
  sit, eamque humanum tantum &amp; commentitium cultum esse ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareat, quis
  dubitat quin talis Missa, sine ullo periculo omitti possit, imo debeat, cum
  repugnet Evangelio? Estque pium &amp; sanctum opus, verum Missae sive Synaxis
  usum Ecclesiae restituere ac reddere, quo per Romanum Pontificem, hoc est
  Antichristum, multis jam annis miserabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter privata fuit, qui quidem adhuc
  mordicusprivatas Missas tenet, adserit, &amp; defendit. Neque id immerito,
  facile enim sentit quod labefactata Missa privata, labefactetur imo ruat
  Universum ejus Regnum &amp; Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, quae Missis illis nititur; ut enim in
  seminibus causa est Arborum &amp; stirpium, ita hujus luctuosissimi dominatus,
  imperii, tyrannidis, nundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis &amp; idololatriae Pontificiae semen fuit
  superstitio Missarum priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum: Nam hae pepererunt &amp; sustinuerunt, veluti
  Atlas quidam, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Papatum; ad harum normam omnia redacta sunt, siquidem
  nihil fuit, quod non Missa aliqua expiari posse creditum est. His aucupatus
  Pontifex Romanus indulgentias, quibus immensam pecuniam ex toto orbe terrarum
  praedatus est; hae Monachorum turbas infinitas coacerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, cum eorum nullus
  alius esset usus, quam demurmurandi Missas privatas, &amp; alioquin inutile
  terrae pondus forent. Hae sunt &amp; fuerunt universa pietas, quam Pontifex
  Romanus profitetur, hanc solam novit ille Religionem, quae in Missis privatis
  consistit; Doctrinam enim Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii non modo non habet, verum acerrime odit
  &amp; prosequitur, &amp; in <pb n="337" facs="tcp:104314:388"/> summa his Missis ipsam
  praedicationem Verbi Divini Pontifex extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navit, ut per omnia Antichristi
  munere fungeretur: Nam in loco unius concionis Verbi, amplius mille Missae
  privatae, hoc est, humani &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitii cultus, contra Divinum Verbum
  successerunt; cum non Missas fieri sed Evangelium praedicare, &amp; Sacramenta
  rite distribuere &amp; admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrare, Christus Apostolis, quorum illi volunt
  esse successores, manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit.</p>
               <p>Curarunt igitur Illustrissimi Principes nostri, &amp; alii
  Evangelii Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinam profitentes Principes &amp; Status, privatas Missas
  penitus aboleri, &amp; verum Missae usum sive Synaxim Christi institutioni,
  exemplo Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, veteris Ecclesiae ac Patrum sententiis conformem, in
  Ecclesiam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocarunt &amp; restituerunt. Quae quidem Missa sive Synaxis summa
  cum reverentia celebratur, servatis pene omnibus usitatis Caeremoniis, quae non
  repugnant pietati; &amp; admiscentur Germanicae sive vernaculae cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones ad
  docendum populum, praecepit enim Paulus, in Ecclesia uti lingua intellecta a
  populo. Porro, quia propter communionem sive usum Sacramenti Missa instituta
  est, hi qui sunt idonei &amp; antea explorati, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento utuntur; ac dignitas
  &amp; usus Sacramenti, summa diligentia ac cura ex Verbo Dei populo
  commendatur, ut sciant &amp; intelligant homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, quantam consolationem
  pavidis conscientiis adferat, ac discant Deo credere, &amp; optima quaeque ab
  eo expectare &amp; petere.</p>
               <p>Et hunc quidem Sacramenti &amp; Missae usum, Scripturae
  consentaneum, Deo gratum, &amp; pietati conducibilem esse, Serenissima Regia
  Majestas Vestra facile agnoscit; neque enim hic aliquid contra Dei Verbum
  admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur, imo secundum Christi mandatum &amp; ordinationem, qui hanc Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram
  Communionem ad hunc finem instituit, omnia geruntur: Nulla est hic admixta,
  prava, aut impia opinio, ut in Missa privata Papistica, cujus finis &amp;
  institutio cum Evangelio pugnat. Nihil hic etiam absque summa reverentia,
  ordine, &amp; decoro, digno Ecclesiae, fieri cernitur. Audemusque adfirmare,

  unquam sub Papatu privatae Missae cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bratae fuerint, provocamusque ad
  testimonia doctissimorum virorum, qui a Majestate Vestra missi in illis locis
  fuerunt, &amp; haec omnia coram fieri viderunt &amp; audierunt.</p>
               <p>Quod enim Adversarii clamitant, Nostros omnes cultus Divinos,
  om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Caeremonias, omnem denique Religionem abolere &amp; labefactare, ea in
  re Principibus nostris, &amp; aliis Evangelii Doctrinam profitentibus,
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriam faciunt; &amp; haec eos insigni quadam malevolentia &amp; odio
  plus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Vatiniano, ut dici solet, confingere &amp; comminisci clare adparet,
  cum ex Doctrina nostrorum, quam consentientem Sacris Literis in lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem
  ediderunt, &amp; Scriptis suis universo orbi Christiano promulgarunt, tum etiam
  exemplis nostrarum Ecclesiarum, in quibus nolint velint co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur fateri, omnia
  religiosius &amp; sanctius fieri, quam apud ipsos; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Dei beneficio
  universus populus, non tantum in templis est religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sior, sed in tota
  disciplina publica modestius se gerit, majoremque erga Magistratum civilem,
  &amp; eos qui Ecclesiis praesunt, reverentiam &amp; hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem exhibet, quam
  unquam antea factum fuerit: &amp; hoc sincerae Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii Doctrinae acceptum
  referre debemus, quae singulos, rectius omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Pontificiis constitutionibus,
  sui officii admonet, &amp; sola in quibus re vera pietas ac cultus divinus
  consistat, tradit ac docet.</p>
               <p>Porro, quod Missae collocatae ad quaestum, ut sub Papatu
  accidit, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter <pb n="338" facs="tcp:104314:389"/> prophanentur, quodque hic abusus in
  omnibus pene templis latis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sime pateat, non est obscurum: Nam Christi
  beneficium qui nos pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioso suo sanguine redemit, idque gratuito pro vili
  stipe &amp; mercede vendere, &amp; tale etiam opus inde constituere velle, quod
  ex sui natura, hoc est ex opere operato, mereatur gratiam, &amp; possit
  adplicari pro pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis aliorum, mortuorum &amp; vivorum, quis non videt summam
  esse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietatem? Quid enim est corpus Domini indigne tractare &amp; sumere, si
  hoc non esset? An potest etiam magis impium quidquam dici, quam illi de Missis
  istis docuerunt? Nempe quod Christus sua passione satisfecerit pro peccatis
  Originis, &amp; instituerit Missam, in qua fieret Oblatio pro quotidianis
  delictis mortalibus &amp; venialibus: cum Christus poenitentiam &amp;
  remissionem peccatorum praedicari mandaverit; Missam vero, hoc est Synaxim, ad
  alium plane finem instituerit, viz. ut porrigatur Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum his quibus opus
  est consolatione, &amp; ut per Verbum &amp; Sacramentum credentes gratiam
  recipiant, &amp; remissionem peccatorum consequantur, non ut ipsi suum opus,
  quod quale quale sit, humanum figmentum, huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus cultus est, contra Scripturam
  Deo offerant ac sacrificent. Hoc enim non placat Deum, ut Christus ipse inquit,
  se frustra coli mandatis homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num: Nam Missam non esse tale opus sive
  Sacrificium, quod mereatur gratiam &amp; prosit etiam aliis, inde adparet, quia
  Missa sive Synaxis ad hoc est instituta, non ut Deo aliquid offeratur, sed ut
  communicantes consolationem hauriant, &amp; veluti pignus seu certum signum
  gratiae ac bonae voluntatis Dei erga se recipiant, atque ita recordentur mortis
  Christi, hoc est, beneficiorum quae per Christum accipiunt, qui qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem pro
  nobis mortuus est, solusque pro peccatis nostris satisfecit, id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que probant
  Verba ipsa quibus &amp; Christus &amp; Paulus de Missa sive Synaxi usi
  sunt.</p>
               <p>Primum enim inquit Christus, hoc est Corpus Meum, quod pro vobis
  traditur. Haec sunt Verba promissionis Divinae quae solam fidem exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt,
  quibusque offertur nobis gratia &amp; remissio peccatorum, ergo non est
  Sacrificium, hoc est, opus quod Deo offeratur &amp; quidem pro abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendis
  peccatis. Item Paulus ait, Annunciantes mortem Domini: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciare autem non
  est Sacrificare, hoc est tale opus Deo reddere, quo peccata deleantur.
  Praeterea Evangelii textus ita sonat, Fregit &amp; dedit Discipulis, inquiens,
  accipite &amp; comedite, &amp;c. item, bibite ex hoc om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp;c. accipere
  autem, comedere, &amp; bibere, non est sacrificare, quia haec opera ex opere
  operato non delent peccata.</p>
               <p>Neque mandatur hisce verbis, ut nos Deo aliquid offeramus, sed
  po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius ut ab eo accipiamus, quia addit, pro vobis traditum, &amp; sanguis qui
  pro vobis effunditur; quae Verba ostendunt, non exhiberi a sumentibus
  Eucharistiam Deo Sacrificium, sed donum hominibus datum. Praeterea vero nemo
  dicit Laicos cum sumunt Sacramentum, Sacrificare: at quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ad hanc Sacram
  Communionem, Missam, sive Synaxim pertinet, nulla est ratio diversitatis, cum
  idem Christus uno eodemque tempore ac momento, propter eundem finem &amp; usum,
  hoc Sacramentum absque differentia utentium Sacerdotum vel Laicorum
  instituerit. Et quemad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum prohibitio utriusque speciei, humanum tantum
  commentum &amp; mandatum est; ita quod de Sacrificio Missae ex opere operato
  gratiam promerente traditur, humana tantum opinio est, contra Verbum Dei, a quo
  in rebus maximis, nempe ad remissionem peccatorum, salutem animarum, &amp;
  vitam aeternam pertinentibus, nullo modo est discedendum: <pb n="339" facs="tcp:104314:389"/> Non enim frustra Paulus inquit &amp; bis repetit, Si nos aut Angelus
  de Coelo Evangelizet vobis praeter id quod Evangelizavimus &amp; accepistis,
  Anathema sit.</p>
               <p>Praeterea nec potest ratio diversitatis adsignari ex Sacris
  Literis, cur magis dicant eos qui Sacramento Eucharistiae fruuntur Sacrificare,
  quam illos qui alio Sacramento, ut Baptismo, utuntur, cum utrumque nihil aliud
  sit, quam Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta, quae Christus horum institutor &amp; auctor prorsus ad
  alium finem, quam ut sint talia Sacrificia, qualia illi comminiscuntur,
  ordinavit. Sed opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit Romanum Pontificem Missas privatas, ad opprimendam
  Christi, cum ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se hostis est, gloriam attollere, ut populum Christianum a
  veritate Evangelica &amp; agnitione Christi, &amp; Sacramentorum legitimo usu,

  gratiarum actio &amp; sacrificium laudis, hi convincuntur propriis ipsorum
  testimoniis &amp; Scriptis quae de Missis extant, haeque persuasiones hominum
  animis etiam hodie de Missis privatis inhaerent: sic enim Thomas inquit in
  Opusculo de Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Altaris, cur Missa instituta sit? Corpus Domini semel
  oblatum est in cruce, pro debito originali, sic offeratur jugiter pro

               <p>Alexander Papa, nihil in Sacrificiis Ecclesiae majus esse
  potest, quam Corpus &amp; Sanguis Christi, nec ulla oblatio hac potior est, sed
  omnes praecellit: item ipsa veritas nos instruit, Calicem ac Panem in

  Gabriel de Canon. Missae, Sacramentum Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristiae veluti Sacrificium summo
  patri oblatum, nedum veniale sed etiam mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale, non dico sumentium sed omnium
  eorum pro quibus offertur, &amp; quantum ad reatum culpae &amp; poenae, plus
  vel minus secundum dispositionem eorum pro quibus offertur, tollit: unde Thomas

  effectum etiam in aliis pro quibus offertur, in quibus non prae-exigit vitam

  eis gratiam obtinet, virtute illius veri Sacrificii a quo omnis gratia in nos

               <p>His &amp; similibus omnes libri Scolasticorum pleni sunt, quibus

                  </note> viz. de Conjugio
  Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, quod itidem Romanus Episcopus contra Scripturam, contra leges
  naturae, &amp; contra omnem honestatem prohibuit, ac multorum peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
  scelerum &amp; turpitudinis occasionem praebuit: sed fortassis ne pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
  dubitari eum esse Christi adversarium, de quo cum illam ipsam prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitionem,
  tum alia quaedam quae in illum solum adperte quadrant, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura clare
  praedixit, oportuit eum talem legem Caelibatus Sacerdotalis sancire, ut sicut
  leo ex unguibus, ita Papa, hoc est Antichristus, ab hac prohibitione
  Sanctissimi &amp; in omnibus honorabilis conjugii, agnoscere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; sic enim
  Paulus inquit, Spiritus autem manifeste dicit, quod in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vissimis temporibus
  discedent quidam a fide, attendentes Spiritibus Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roris &amp; Doctrinis
  Daemoniorum, in hypocrisi loquentium mendacium, cauteriatam habentium
  conscientiam suam, prohibentium nubere: haec si non in Romanum Episcopum
  congruunt, in quem alium convenient? nemo enim alius quam ipse conjugium
  Sacerdotibus injustissime eripuit, &amp; caelibatum impurissimum sub specie
  Sanctitatis, &amp; ut Paulus ait in Hypocrisi &amp; per mendacium
  introduxit.</p>
               <p>Scriptura non minus Sacerdotibus, quam alterius sortis hominibus
  ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonium liberum permittit, sunt enim de eadem carne, quae totum ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
  humanum vestit &amp; continet, nati: non possunt igitur naturam suam mutare,
  non possunt carnem abjicere, nec absque singulari Dei dono caelibes vivere, nam
  non quilibet, ut Christus inquit, capit Verbum hoc: &amp; Paulus, propter
  Fornicationem unusquisque suam Uxorem habeat; &amp; peculiariter de
  Sacerdotibus ait, constituas per civitates Presbyteros sicut disposui tibi, si
  quis sine crimine est, unius Uxoris vir, Filios habens fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles, non in
  accusatione luxuriae; item, oportet Episcopum esse irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibilem, unius
  Uxoris virum: patet igitur hanc prohibitionem <pb n="342" facs="tcp:104314:391"/> non ex
  jure Divino, sed potius contra Sacram Scripturam decretum esse.</p>
               <p>At solet a quibusdam Pontificiis defensoribus opponi, quod licet
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugium Sacerdotum non videatur vetitum Divinis Literis, tamen Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes a
  veteribus temporibus in hunc usque diem in caelibatu vixisse, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que de causa
  addunt non esse discedendum hac in re a tali exemplo, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que permittendum
  conjugium Sacerdotibus. His, Serenissime ac poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissime Rex, adperte
  refragantur historiae, tum Ecclesiasticae tum aliae, ex quibus clare patet,
  Episcopos &amp; Sacerdotes veteribus temporibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugatos fuisse.</p>
               <p>Primum enim Spiridion Cyprius Episcopus, vir unus ex ordine
  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetarum, ut Historia Ecclesiastica ait, Uxorem habuit ex qua filiam
  no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Irenen suscepit; deinde ordine pene omnes Episcopi Uxorati fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,
  quorum plurimi Filii postea, tum Romani, tum alii Episcopi cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ati sunt: fuit
  enim Sylverius Papa Hormisdae Episcopi Filius, Papa Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Theodori
  Episcopi Hierosolymitani, Papa Adrianus secundus Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari Episcopi, Joannes
  decimus Papa Sergii Papae, Gelasius Valerii Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi, Papa Joannes decimus
  quintus Leonis Presbyteri Filius; &amp; ne omnes enumeremus, patet vel unica
  historia Polycratis, ex cujus parentibus septem fuerunt per ordinem Episcopi,
  ipse vero fuit octavus: at non est credibile omnes illos ex illegitimis nuptiis
  prognatos esse, cum ipsi ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nones &amp; decreta Synodorum doceant, conjugia
  Sacerdotum esse licita; sic enim inquit Canon Apostolorum, si quis docuerit
  Sacerdotem sub ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentu Religionis propriam Uxorem contemnere, Anathema
  sit.</p>
               <p>Item extat praeclarum exemplum de Paphnutio confessore, qui
  uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versae Synodo Nicenae prohibitionem conjugii dissuasit, &amp; obtinuit ne

  in jure Pontificio recensetur, extatque decretum quoddam sextae Synodi, in quo
  palam damnatur pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitio conjugii Sacerdotalis.</p>
               <p>Sed objicitur iterum, propter votum castitatis, quod Sacerdotes
  praesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terunt, non posse eis permitti nuptias. Hoc quale votum sit, quamque
  obligatorium, quod sine peccato servari non potest, Serenissima Regia Majestas
  Vestra pro summa sapientia &amp; Doctrina, facile aestimabit: neque enim donum
  castitatis omnibus datum est, idque caelibatus ipse Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp;
  quotidiana experientia etiam nunc testatur; &amp; quid de tali voto sentiendum
  sit, Sanctorum Patrum sententia declaravit, sic enim Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus ait, quidam
  nubentes post votum adserunt adulteros esse, ego autem dico vobis quod graviter
  peccant qui tales dividunt. Et Cypria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus de virginibus qui continentiam
  voverunt, sic inquit, si perseverare nolunt, vel non possunt, melius est ut
  nubant, quam ut in ignem deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis suis cadant.</p>
               <p>Censent itaque praedicti Sancti Patres, tale votum non debere
  impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire Matrimonium, sicut revera etiam non potest obstare quo minus hi
  quibus donum continentiae non contigit, matrimonium contrahant: nam melius est
  nubere quam uri, ut inquit Paulus; Quid autem est impurius coelibatu illo
  Sacerdotali? quam pauci vero continent? quam plurimi in fornicationibus,
  adulteriis, &amp; id genus similibus ac gravioribus peccatis &amp; flagitiis
  pene quotidie deprehenduntur, contra quod sileges severe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverterent, non
  habituri essent, quo de illo ficto &amp; hypocritico coeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batu adeo
  gloriarentur?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:104314:391"/>Ac tradunt Historiae in Germania triennium
  aut amplius, Sacerdotes acerrime restitisse Sanctioni Pontificis Hildebrandi de
  caelibatu, qui sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma vi eis Uxores adimere conatus est, hique justissimas
  causas contra il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam constitutionem ac tyrannidem Pontificiam, pro Matrimonio
  defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo allegarunt, in qua re cum nihil aequi obtinere potuerint, tandem
  ingens orta est seditio contra Archiepiscopum Moguntinum, qui decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
  pontificium detulat, adeo ut is ab incaepto destiterit; &amp; vix tandem Papa
  post multas diras execrationes &amp; bullas, quibus etiam coelum ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
  expugnare conatus est, miseris Sacerdotibus facultatem liberam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugii,
  contra divina &amp; humana jura abstulerit, &amp; omnis generis libidinis &amp;
  impuritatis exercendae occasionem praebuerit: Extat quoque Epistola ad Nicolaum
  Episcopum Romanum I. Divi Udalrici Episcopi Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stensis, qua is gravissimis

               <p>Cum igitur Principes nostri, &amp; alii porfitentes Evangelii

  palam viderent &amp; experirentur, quod non posset coelibatus ille sine

  ac Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Sacerdotibus, sicut hoc Scriptura Sacra &amp; exempla Sanctorum
  Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum ac veteris Ecclesiae exigunt &amp; testantur, liberum permiserunt.
  Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimarunt enim hoc quoque ad suum officium pertinere, ut infinitorum
  scandalorum &amp; scelerum, quae necessario secum trahit caelibatus
  Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis, occasionem &amp; materiam praescinderent &amp; auferrent,

  crudeliter necatos, pharmacis foetus depulsos, &amp; similia nefaria crimina
  commissa, quos solos fructus caelibatus ille protulit: ideoque plurimi nunc
  sunt conjugati Sacerdotes apud nos, multi etiam caelibes, idque cujusque
  conscientiae ut vel ducat uxorem, vel a conjugio abstine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, permittitur; modo
  ita vivat ne sit aliis offendiculo, alioqui enim non minus in Sacerdotes quam
  reliquum vulgus, hac quoque parte, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum leges politicas animadvertitur. Ac

  God, right trusty and well-beloved, we greet you well: And whereas for the
  Vertue, Learning, and good Qualities which we saw and perceived heretofore in
  you, judging you thereby a Personage that would sincerely, devoutly, purely,
  and plainly set forth the Word of God, and instruct our People in the truth of
  the same, after a simple and plain sort, for their better instruction, unity,
  quiet, and agreement in the points thereof, we advanced you to the room and
  office of a Bishop within this our Realm; and so endowed you with great
  Revenues and Possessions; perceiving after, by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of preaching
  within this our Realm, our said People were brought into a diversity of
  Opinion, whereby there ensued contention amongst them; which was only engendred
  by a certain contemptuous manner of speaking, against honest, laudable, and
  tolerable Ceremonies, Usages, and Customs of the Church; we were enforced, by
  our sundry Letters, to admonish and command you, amongst others, to preach
  God's Word sincerely, to declare abuses plainly, and in no wise contentiously
  to treat of matters indifferent, which be neither necessary to our Salvation,
  as the good and vertuous Ceremonies of Holy Church, ne yet to be in any wise
  contemned and abrogated, for that they be incitements and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Vertue,
  and allurements to Devotion: all which our travail not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, so little
  regard was by some taken and adhibited to our advertisements therein, that we
  were constrained to put our own Pen to the Book, and to conceive certain
  Articles, which were by all you the Bishops and whole Clergy of this our Realm
  in Convocation agreed on, as Catholick, meet, and necessary to be by our
  Authority for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all contention set forth, read and taught to our
  Subjects, to bring the same in unity, quietness, and good concord: supposing
  then that no Person having Authority under us, would either have presumed to
  have spoken any word, that might have offended the sentence and meaning of the
  same, or have been any thing remiss, slack, or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the plain setting
  forth of them as they be conceived, so as by that mean of abstinence such quiet
  and unity should not grow thereupon as we desired and looked for of the same;
  and perceiving eft-soons, by credible report, that our labours, travail, and
  desire therein, is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless defeated, and in manner by general and
  contemptuous words <pb n="361" facs="tcp:104314:400"/> spoken, by sundry light and seditious
  Persons, contemned and despised, so that by the abstinence of direct and plain
  setting-forth of the said Articles, and by the fond and contentious manner of
  speaking, that the said light Personages do still use against the honest Rites,
  Customs, Usa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and ceremonial Things of the Church, our People be much more
  offended than they were before; and in a manner exclaim that we will suffer
  that injury at any Man's hand, whereby they think both God, us, and our whole
  Realm highly offended, insomuch that principally upon that ground, and for the
  Reformation of those Follies and Abuses, they have made this commotion and
  insurrection, and have thereby grievou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly offended us, dammaged themselves,
  and troubled many of our good Subjects: We be now enforced, for our discharge
  towards God, and for the tender love and zeal we bear unto the tranquillity and
  loving unity of our said People and Subjects, again to readdress these our
  Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to all the Bishops of our Realm, and amongst other unto you, as a
  peremptory warning to admonish you, to demean and use your self for the
  redobbying of these things as shall be hereafter declared, upon pain of
  deprivation from the Bishoprick, and further to be punished for your contempt,
  if you shall offend in the contrary, as Justice shall require for your own
  Trespass.</p>
               <p>And first, we straitly charge and command you, that plainly and
  di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, without any additions, ye shall every Holy day, wheresoever ye
  shall be within your Diocess, when ye may so do with your health and convenient
  commodity, openly, in your Cathedral Church, or the Parish Church of the place
  where ye shall for time be, read and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our Articles; and in no wise, in
  the rest of your words which ye shall then speak of your self, if you speak any
  thing, utter any word that shall make the same, or any word in the same,
  doubtful to the People.</p>
               <p>Secondly; We will and command you, That you shall in your
  Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son travel from place to place in all your Diocess, as you may with your
  commodity, and endeavour your selves every Holy-day to make a Collation to the
  People, and in the same to set forth plainly the Texts of Scripture that you
  shall treat of; and with that also as well to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the obedience due by
  God's Laws to their Prince and Soveraign Lord, against whose commandment they
  ought in no wise, though the same were unjust, to use any violence, as to
  commend and praise honest Ceremonies of the Church as they be to be praised, in
  such plain and reverent sort, that the People may perceive they be not
  contemned, and yet learn how they were instituted, and how they ought to be
  observed and esteemed; using such a temperance therein, as our said People be
  not corrupted, by putting over-much affiance in them, which a part should more
  offend, than the clear silencing of the same, and that our People may thereto
  the better know their duties to us, being their King and Soveraign Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; We straitly charge and command you, That neither in
  your private communications you shall use any words that may sound 
  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:104314:401"/> to the contrary of this our Commandment, ne you shall
  keep or retain any Man of any degree, that shall in his words privatly or
  openly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, speak in these matters of the Ceremonies,
  conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously or contemptously; but we will that in case ye have, or shall
  have towards you any such Person that will not better temper his Tongue, you
  shall, as an Offender and a Seductor of our People, send the same in sure
  custody to us and our Council, to be punished as shall appertain; and semblably
  to do with other Strangers whom ye shall hear to be notable offenders in that
  part.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; Our pleasure and commandment is, That you shall on
  your behalf, give strait commandment upon like pain of deprivation and further
  punishment, to all Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Religious Houses,
  Colledges, and other places Ecclesiastical within your Diocess, that they and
  every of them shall, touching the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different praise of Ceremonies, the
  avoiding of contentious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptous Communication, concerning any of the
  same, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and plain reading of our said Articles, observe and
  perform, in their Churches, Monasteries, and other Houses Ecclesiastical
  aforesaid, the very same order that is before to you prescribed. And further,
  that you permit nor suffer any Man, of what degree soever in learning,
  Strangers or other, to preach in any place within your said Diocess out of his
  own Church, by virtue of any License by us, or any other of our Ministers,
  granted before the fifteenth day of this month, neither in your presence nor
  elsewhere, unless he be a Man of such hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sty, vertue, learning, and judgment, as you shall think able for
  that purpose, and one whom in manner you dare answer for.</p>
               <p>Finally; Whereas we be advertised that divers Priests have
  presumed to marry themselves, contrary to the custom of our Church of
  <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> our pleasure is, Ye shall make secret enquiry within your
  Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, whether there be any such resiant within the same or not: And in case
  ye shall find that there be any Priests that have so presumed to marry
  themselves, and have sithence nevertheless used and exercised in any thing the
  Office of Priesthood, we charge you, as ye will answer upon the pains
  aforesaid, not to conceal their doings therein, but rather to signify their
  demeanour to our Council, or to cause them to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and so sent up
  unto us accordingly. Given under our Signet at our Castle of <hi>Windsor,</hi>
  the 19<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>November,</hi> in the 28<hi>th</hi> Year of Our
  Reign.</p>

 5.</note>SInce me thought (my Lord of <hi>Durham</hi>) that both the Bishops of
  <hi>York, Winchester,</hi> and your Reasons and Texts were so fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
  this other day, in the House, as to my seeming and supposal, the most of the
  House was satisfied; I marvelled not a little why eft-soons you have sent to me
  this now your writing, being in a manner few other Texts or Reasons than there
  were declared both by the Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> and me, to make smally
  or nothing to your intended purpose: but either I esteem that you do it to
  prove my simple judgment alone, which indeed doth not much use (tho not the
  wisest) to call in aid, the judgments of other learned Men, and so by mine
  ignorant answer, seem to win the Field; or else that you be too much blinded in
  your own fansy and judgment, to think that a Truth, which by learning you have
  not yet proved, nor I fear me cannot by Scriptures, nor any other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors
  probable grounds, though I know mine unsufficiency in learning, if the matter
  were indifferent, and that the ballance stood equal, since I take the verity of
  the Cause rather to favorize the part I take than yours; it giveth me therefore
  great boldness, not presuming in Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but in justness of the Cause,
  seeing by writing you have provoked me to it, to make answer to your Arguments:
  Therefore I beginning now to reply to your first Allegation, shall essay to
  prove, if I can, that your own Author in place by you alledged, maketh plain
  against your Opinion; for as you alledg him, St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith,
  <hi>Quod sufficit so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus pudor pro poena,</hi> then Articular Confession is not
  by commandment necessary; for if it were, this word (<hi>Solus</hi>) is by your
  Author ill set; therefore your Author in this place furdereth you but little,
  To your <hi>Fallax</hi> Argument, I deny your consequent, founded only upon
  small Reason, which is the ground of your <hi>Fallax</hi> Argument: which
  Reason I need not take away, for your alledged Author doth shew too plainly, in
  his 5. <hi>Homily, Tom.</hi> 5. that you gather wrong sense upon his words; for
  he saith, with much more touching this matter, these few words, <hi>Non
  hominibus peccata detegere cogo</hi>; then this other Text before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
  is not to be understood as you will by writing it. Further, me thinketh, I need
  not (God thank you) too greatly study for Authors to conclude your wrong taking
  of Texts, for those your self alledg serveth me well to purpose: for all your
  labour is to prove that Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession were by God commanded, and both
  your Authorities of <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> sheweth nothing but that
  they did confess their sins, and yet do not they affirm that it was by
  commandment; wherefore they make for mine Argument and not for yours. Your
  other Texts of <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. and <hi>Matthew</hi> 10. were so throughly
  answered this other day, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly declared not to appertain to our
  grounded Argument, that I marvel you be not ashamed eft-soons to put them in
  writing, and to found your Argument now so fondly on them; for what fonder
  Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be made to prove thereby a necessity of Confession, than to say,
  If you confess not, I cannot forgive? Would a Thief which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth 
  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:104314:403"/> Felony, think himself obliged by the Law to disclose his
  Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, if the Law say no more, but if thou confess not I cannot forgive thee?
  or would the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t the sooner therefore
  to be forgiven? This is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so apparent, that none can but perceive except
  he would not see. As touching <hi>Origens</hi> places by you alledged; as the
  first, in <hi>Leviticum,</hi> sheweth that we be as much bound <hi>lavare
  stratum lacrimis, as dicere Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdoti,</hi> which no Man, I think, will affirm
  that we be bound to do; and yet he affirmeth not that any of them is commanded:
  the Text also whereby ye would approve his so saying, doth not yet speak
  <hi>quod pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciabo justitiam meam Sacerdoti,</hi> but <hi>Domino:</hi> The
  other of <hi>Iames</hi> seemeth better to make for extream Unction, than for
  Confession; for when was ever the use, that Folk coming only to Confession,
  were wont to be anointed with Oil, therefore this makes nothing to your
  Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As touching <hi>Origen</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. he saith not,
  <hi>quod obligamur di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Sacerdoti,</hi> but <hi>si confiteantur</hi>; and
  seemeth rather to perswade Men that they should not <hi>parvipendere
  Confessionem,</hi> (as all good Folk wold) than that they were obliged to
  Confess them to a Priest. Though <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an de Lapsis,</hi> doth praise them
  which do Confess their Faults to Priests, yet doth he confess that we be not
  bound to do so; for he saith in the highest of his praise these words, <hi>How
  much be they then higher in Faith, and better in fear of God, which though they
  be not bound by any deed of Sacrifice, or Book, yet be they content sorrowfully
  to confess to the Priest sins!</hi> He knowledgeth no bond in us by neither
  fact of Sacrifice or Libel, why alledg you (tho he praise Auricular Confession)
  that we should be bound by God and Law thereto? This is no proof thereof,
  neither by Reason nor by Scripture, nor any good Authority. And whereas he
  saith further, <hi>Confiteantur singuli, quaeso vos fratres, delictum
  suum;</hi> this doth not argue a precept: nor yet the saying of <hi>Esay,</hi>
  cap. 43. <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
  Septuaginta;</hi> nor <hi>Solomon</hi> in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> 10. for these
  speak rather of knowledging our Offence to God in our Heart, than of Auricular
  Confession; after <hi>David</hi> the Prophets saying and teaching, when he
  said, <hi>Tibi soli peccavi,</hi> that was not to a Priest. By the text also
  which you alledg, beginning, <hi>circa personas vero ministrorum,</hi> &amp;c.
  you do open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confess that the Church hath not accepted Auricular Confession
  to be by God's Commandment; or else by your saying and Allegation, they have
  long erred: for you confess that the Church hath divers times changed both to
  whom Confession should be made, and times when; and that also they have changed
  divers ways for divers Regions; if it were by God's Commandment they might not
  do thus: Wherefore, my Lord, since I hear no other Allegations, I pray you
  blame not me tho I be not of your Opinion; and of the both, I think that I have
  more cause to think you obstinate, than you me, seeing your Authors and
  Allegations make so little to your purpose. And thus fare you well.</p>
