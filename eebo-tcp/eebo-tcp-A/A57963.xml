            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

through that hole the young morning glances of the day-light of glory, and a part of the Throne, and the halfe of his face that sits on the Throne, and the glorious undefiled ones that stand before the Throne, but this fulnesse doth not overflow to brimme and banke; the Vessell is in a capacity to receive many quarts and gallons more of the new Wine of glory, that growes in that new Land of Harmony.

personall priviledge; and to want this, is not our sinne: to have it, was <hi>Christs</hi> glory: But the nearer any is to God, the more heavenly are the affections. Secondly, When <hi>God</hi> framed the humane nature and humane soule of <hi>Christ,</hi> hee created a more noble and curious piece, then was the first <hi>Adam:</hi> It is true, <hi>hee was like us in all things, except sinne,</hi> and essentially a man; but in his generation there was a cut of the art of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in <hi>Christ</hi> more then in the forming of <hi>Adam,</hi> or then in the generation of men, suppose man had never sinned; as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. <hi>The power of the most High shall over-shadow thee:</hi> never man was thus to be borne. Whence give me leave to think, that there was more of <hi>God</hi> in the humane nature of <hi>Christ,</hi> as nature is a vessel coming out of the Potters house, then ever was in <hi>Adam,</hi> or living man; though man had never sinned: And so, that hee had a humane soule of a more noble structure and fabrick, in which the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> in the act of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had a higher hand, then when <hi>Adam</hi> was created, according to the image of <hi>God</hi>; though <hi>hee was a man like us in all things, sinne excepted.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Pos.</hi> Undeniably, Grace did so accompany Nature, that hee could not feare more then the object required. Had all the strength of men and <hi>Angels</hi> been massed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperated in one, they should have been in a higher measure troubled, then <hi>Christ</hi> was: So how much trouble was in <hi>Christs</hi> affections, as much there was of reason, perfumed and lustered with grace. Hee was not as man in his intellectualls, wise, or desirous to be wise, (as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah,</hi> and men now are taken with the disease of curiosity) above what was fit: So neither were his affections above banks; hee saw the blackest and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est houre, that ever any saw; suppose all the sufferings of the damned, for eternity, were before them in one sight, or came on them at once, it should annihilate all that are now, or shall be in <hi>hell.

Now our affections rise and swell before reason: 1. They are often imaginary, and are on horse-back and in armes at the stirring of a straw. 2.

First, Hee never could want faith, which is a serenity, quietnes, and silence of the soule and assurance of the love of <hi>God.</hi> Secondly, Hee could have no doubting, or sinfull disturbance of mind; because hee could have no conscience of guilt, which could over-cloud the love and tenderest favour of his <hi>Father</hi> to him. But as <hi>peace</hi> is opposed to paine, and sense of wrath and punishment, for the guilt of our sinnes, so hee wanted <hi>Physicall peace,</hi> and was now under penall disturbance and disquietnesse of soule. So wee see some have <hi>peace,</hi> but not pardon; as the secure sinners, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.3.

               </p>
               <p>The third Point is, How a troubled soule can stand with a personall union. Can <hi>God,</hi> can the soule of <hi>God</hi> be troubled?<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>And how it can be.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> I shall shew, first, How this must be: Secondly, How this can be. It must be, first, Because the losse of heaven is the greatest losse. To ransome a <hi>King</hi> requireth more millions, then pence to ransome slaves. When wee were cast and forfeited, more than <hi>an hundred and forty foure thousand Kings</hi> (in the <hi>Lords</hi> decree they were <hi>Kings</hi>) were cast out of heaven: where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> was there gold on earth to buy heaven, and so many <hi>Kings?</hi> And yet Justice must have payment; a <hi>God-troubled Saviour,</hi> and a Soule-troubled <hi>God</hi> was little enough. Oh, saith <hi>Love</hi> to infinite <hi>Justice,</hi> What will you give for me? will you buy me? my deare children, the heires of eternall grace? A price below the worth of so many <hi>Kings,</hi> Justice cannot heare of; equall it must be, or more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Law</hi> cannot sleep satisfied with a Mans soule-trouble; for as sinne troubles an infinite <hi>Gods</hi> soule, so farre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as our darts can flie up against the Sun, so must the soule-trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of him who is <hi>God,</hi> expiate sin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Heaven is not onely a transcendent Jewel, deare in it selfe, but our <hi>Father</hi> would propine Rebels with a Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and a Kingdome, which is deare in our legall esteeme. <hi>What standeth my Crowne to God?</hi> Why it could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be dearer; The soule of <hi>God</hi> was weighed for it: that not onely freedome, but the dearest of prices might commend and cry up, above all heaven's, <hi>Christs</hi> love.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If my soule, or your soules, O redeemed of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> could be valued every one of them worth ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand millions of soules, and as many heavens, they could not over-weigh the soule of <hi>God</hi>; the soule that lodges in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous union with <hi>God:</hi> and the losse of heaven to the troubled soule of this noble, and <hi>high and lofty one,</hi> though but for a time, was more, and infinitely greater then my losse of heaven, and the losse of all the elect for eternity.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I love not to dispute here, but <hi>God,</hi> if wee speake of his absolute power, without respect to his free decree, could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> have pardoned sinne without a ransome, and gifted all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:44978:23"/>
and fallen <hi>Angels</hi> with heaven, without any satisfaction of either the sinner,<note place="margin">God <hi>exacted not satisfaction for sins by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of nature.</hi>
                  </note> or his Surety; for hee neither punisheth sin, nor tenders heaven to <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> by necessity of nature, as the fire casteth out heat, and the sunne light; but freely: onely supposing that frame of providence, and decrees of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, and redeeming sinners, that now is, the <hi>Lord</hi> could not but be steaddie in his decrees; yet this is but necessity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, and at the second hand. But here was the businesse, <hi>God,</hi> in the depth of his eternall wisdome, did so frame and draw the designe and plot of saving lost man, as salvation was to runne in no other channell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The way of grace how lovely.</hi>
                  </note> but such an one, the bank where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was the freest grace and tenderest love that can enter in the heart of <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi>; for hee drew the lines of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven through grace, all the way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Grace hardly can work but by choice and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> arbitration: choice and election is sutable to <hi>Grace.</hi> Hence <hi>Grace</hi> casts lots on <hi>Man,</hi> not falne <hi>Angels</hi>; and the eternall lot of transcendent mercy must fall on the bosome of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and some others, not on <hi>Esau</hi> and others.

The first <hi>Adam</hi> killed us, and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in two <hi>deaths,</hi> and sealed our grave in one peece of an houre; he concluded all under wrath.

               <p>Seventhly, we judge God with sense, with the humor of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> reason, not with reason; the oare that God rolleth his vessell withall, is broken (say we) because the end of the oare is in the

The world judged <hi>God</hi> in person a <hi>Samaritane,</hi> one that had a devill, if we mis-judge his person, we may mis-judge his providence and wayes. Suspend your sense of Gods wayes, while you see his ends that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, and instead of judging, wonder and adore, or then beleeve implicitly that the way of <hi>God</hi> is equall, or doe both, and submit, and be silent. Heart-dialogues, and heart-speeches against <hi>God,</hi> that arises as smoake in the Chimney, are challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and summons against our highest Landlord, for his owne house and land.</p>

               <p>Hence let me stay a little on these two; First, what a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conscience is: Secondly, what course the troubled in soule are to take in imitation of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> A soule troubled for sinne must either be a soule feared and perplexed, for the penall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, wrath, and indignation of <hi>God,</hi> or the eternall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sinne, as these come under the apprehension of the evill of punishment; or, for sinne as it faileth against the love of <hi>God,</hi> or for both. In any of these three respects, it is no sinne to be soule-troubled for sinne, upon these conditions: 1. That the soule bee free of faithlesse doubting of <hi>Gods</hi> love. Now <hi>Christ</hi> was free of this, he could not but have a fixed, intire, and never broken confidence of his Fathers eternall love. If we have any sinne in our soule-trouble for sinne, it's from unbeliefe, not from soule-trouble; if their be mud and clay in the streams, it is from the bankes, not from the fountaine. Or, 2. if the soule feare the ill of punishment, as the greatest ill, and as a greater then the ill of sinne, there is more passion, then sound light in the feare, this could not be in <hi>Christ</hi>; the aversion of the <hi>Lords</hi> heart, from the party in whom there is sinne, either by reall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, Or by free imputation, and the in-drawing of rayes, and irradiations, and out-flowings of divine love is a high-evill in a soule that hath any thing of the nature of a sonne in him; now there was as much of a sonne in <hi>Christ,</hi> as a mans nature could be capable of: and the more of <hi>God</hi> that was in <hi>Christ,</hi>

And this could not be a sinne, but an act of gracious Soule-sorrow, that sinne and hell intervened between the Moone and the Sunne; the soule of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Lord</hi>; the more of Heaven in the soule, and the more of <hi>God:</hi> the want of <hi>God</hi> and of Heaven is the greater <hi>Hell.</hi> Suppose we that the whole light in the bodie of the Sun were utterly extinct, and that the Sunne were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a body as darke as the outside of a Caldron, that should be a greater losse, then if an halfe penny candle were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of light. <hi>Christ</hi> had more to lose, then a world of millions of <hi>Angels</hi>; Imagine a creature of as much <hi>Angelike</hi> capacity, as ten thousand times, ten thousand thousand of <hi>Angels,</hi> all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperated in one, if this glorious <hi>Angel</hi> were filled, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his capacitie, with the highest, and most pure and refined glory of heaven; and againe were immediatly stript naked of all this glory, and then plunged into the depth and heart of <hi>Holl,</hi> and of a lake of more then <hi>Hells</hi> ordinary temper, of fire and brimstone; or suppose, <hi>God</hi> should adde millions of degrees of more pure and unmixed wrath and curses, this <hi>Angels</hi> soule must be more troubled, then wee can easily apprehend; yet this is but a comparison below the thing; but the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> in whole person, heaven in the highest degree was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with him, being throwne down from the top of so high a glory, to a sad and fearefull condition, an agony, and swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of blood, (<hi>God</hi> knowes the cause) that shouting and tears of this low condition, drew out that saddest complaint, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> his losse must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more then all we can say in these shaddowes.</p>
               <p>This sheweth the cause, why there is not among troubles any so grievous, as the want of the presence of <hi>God,</hi> to a soule fatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and feasted with the continuall marrow and fatnesse of the <hi>Lords</hi> house.

(1.) To be carnall in part, as Vers. 14. to doe which wee allow not, to doe what wee would not, and what wee hate, to doe, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon case, not peculiar to a troubled conscience onely, but to all the Saints, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. (2.) <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh not of beleeving, as hee must doe, if hee speak onely of a scrupulous and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conscience; but hee speaketh of <gap reason="foreign">

(3.) A scrupulous and troubled conscience will never yeeld, so long as hee is in that condition, that hee does any good, or that hee belongs to God; as is cleare, <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> in this case yeeldeth, <hi>hee does good, hates evill, delights in the Law of the Lord in the inner man; hath a desire to doe good, hath a law in his mind
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44978:31"/>
that resisteth the motions of the flesh.</hi> (4.) Yea, the <hi>Apostle</hi> then had no cause to feare the body of sinne, or to judge himself wretched; this was his unbeleefe, and there was no ground of his feare; because hee was pardoned, hee <hi>knew that he was freed from condemnation.</hi> It was then <hi>Paul</hi>'s sinne, and is the sinfull scrupulosity of unbeleevers to say, being once justified, <hi>Sinne dwells in me,</hi> and <hi>there is a law in my members, rebelling against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity unto the law of sinne</hi>; and <hi>I am carnall, and sold under sin</hi>; and <hi>I doe evill, even that which I hate</hi>; for all these are lies, and speeches of unbeleefe: The justified man sinneth not, his heart is clean, hee doth nothing against a law. But I well remember that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and particularly, <hi>Chemnitius, Calvin, Beza,</hi> prove against <hi>Papists,</hi> that concupiscence is sin after baptisme, even in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; and it is called eleven or twelve times with the name of <hi>sin, Rom. c.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 8. and they teach that of <hi>Augustine</hi> as a truth, <hi>Inest non ut non sit, sed ut non imputetur.</hi> So we may use all these Arguments against <hi>Libertines,</hi> to prove wee are, even being justified, such as can sin, and doe transgresse the Law; and therefore ought to confesse these sins, be troubled in conscience for them, complaine and sigh in our fetters, though wee know that we are justified and freed from the guilt of sin, and the obligation to eternall wrath. But sin is one thing, and the obligation to eternall wrath is another thing: <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> confound them, and so mistake grosly the nature of <hi>sinne,</hi> and of the <hi>Law,</hi> and of <hi>Justification.</hi> Some imprudently goe so farre on, that they teach,<note place="margin">

The morning dawning of light, is light; the first springing of the child in the belly, is a motion of life; the least warmings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of <hi>Christs</hi> breathings, is the heat of life: When the pulse of <hi>Christ</hi> new framed in the soule moveth most weakly, the new birth is not dead; the very swonings of the love of <hi>Christ</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be incident to a buried man. 5. When <hi>Christ</hi> rebuketh little faith and doubting, hee supposeth faith: hee who is but a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> sinking, and cryeth to <hi>Christ,</hi> is not drowned as yet. 6. The Disciples prayer, <hi>Lord increase our faith; Christs</hi> praying that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the faith of the Saints, when they are winnowed, may not faile; the exhortation to <hi>be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> prove, the Saints faith may be at a stand, and may stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and slide. 7.

Now its known, that as these are often trialls of the faith of the Saints, yet are they soure fruits of our fleshly indulgence to our carnall delights, and of our <hi>not opening to our Beloved, when hee knocketh,</hi> Cant. 5.2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

And let us not thinke that the threed and tract of the Scriptures coherence, one Verse following on another, as the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath ordered them, is but a cast of chance, or an humane thing: When the <hi>Spouse</hi> rideth on the high places of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and saith, <hi>Isai.</hi> 49.13. <hi>Sing,

Flesh and

                     <hi>Three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice given in against</hi> Christ <hi>and answered by him.</hi>

All the elect have sinned, and by the law are under eternall wrath: To this claime, our <hi>Advocate</hi> and <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> could say nothing on the contrary. It's true <hi>Lord. Christ</hi> doth satisfie the Law, but not contradict it. The very word of the <hi>Gospel</hi> answereth all these. In this regard, <hi>Christs</hi> silence was an answer; and to this, <hi>Christ</hi> said, <hi>What shall I say?</hi> I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou art the sinner in Law; to this <hi>Christ</hi> answered, <hi>A body thou hast given me. The Sonne of man came not to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but to serve, and to give himselfe a ransome for many.</hi> Matth. 20.28.

                  </note> when it is the fault onely of some weak mis-judging soules; so doe they take the Saints off from all disquietnesse and griefe of mind for neglect of spirituall duties, as if all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow and displeasure for our sinfull omissions, were nothing but a legall sorrow for want of selfe-righteousnesse, and a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unbeleefe: but its formally not any such thing, but lawfull and necessary, to make the sinner goe with a low sayle, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem the more highly of <hi>Christ</hi>; and its onely sinfull, when abused to such a legall inference, <hi>I omit this and this, I sinne in this and this,</hi> ergo, <hi>God is not my Father, nor am I his sonne.</hi>

Revel. 1.5, 6. Rom. 12.1. But hee that remaineth the servant of sin, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the flesh, and is given up to a reprobate mind, &amp;c. is no such man; <hi>ergo,</hi> such a man hath no claime to <hi>God</hi> as his <hi>Father:</hi> and upon good grounds may, and ought to question his being in <hi>Christ.</hi> Onely, let these cautions be observed. 1. It is not safe to argue from the quantity of holy walking; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sound beleevers may find untowardnesse in wel-doing, yet must not cast away themselves for that. A smoking flaxe is not quenched by <hi>Christ,</hi> for that it hath little heat, or little light; and therefore ought not by us. 2. Beware we lean not too much to the quality of walking holily, to inferre, <hi>I fast twice a weeke, I give tithes of all I have</hi>; then, <hi>God I thanke</hi> him, I am not an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> as the <hi>Publican,</hi> and a wicked man. Sincerity is a sensible, speaking grace; its seldome in the soule without a witnesse. <hi>Lord, thou knowest that I love thee</hi> (saith <hi>Peter</hi>;) hee could answer for sincerity, but not for quantity: hee durst not answer <hi>Christ,</hi> that hee knew that hee loved him more then these. Sincerity is humble, and walketh on positives, <hi>Lord, I love thee</hi>; but dare not adventure on comparatives, <hi>Lord, I love thee more then others.</hi> 3. There be certain houres, when the beleever cannot make strong conclusions, to inferre, I am holy, therefore I am justified; because in darknesse wee see nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther black nor white, and <hi>Gods</hi> light hides our case from us, that wee may be humbled, and beleeve. 4. Beleeving is surer then too frequent gathering warmnesse from our own hot skin.</p>

For if the man be a back-slider in heart and a servant of sinne, <hi>Christ</hi> never touched his pulse. He hath as yet sure grounds to question, whether he be loved of <hi>God,</hi> or be in <hi>Christ,</hi> or no; for except you prove the man <hi>to be loved with an everlasting love,</hi> you can prove nothing: And your argument will not conclude any thing for the mans peace, except you prove him to be chosen of <hi>God</hi>; which is his onely question. But say that hee <hi>is loved from everlasting,</hi> and that hee is in <hi>Christ,</hi> by faith, its easie to prove, that <hi>his sinnes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change everlasting love, nor make him lesse beloved of God,</hi>

As the one is 1. Naturall; the latter, free? 2. The love of the <hi>Father</hi> to the Sonne, as his <hi>consubstantiall Son,</hi> and so farre as it's essentially included in his love to <hi>Jesus Christ Mediator,</hi> is not a love founded on grace and free-mercy, which might never have beene in <hi>God</hi>; because essentially, the <hi>Father</hi> must love his Sonne <hi>Christ,</hi> as his Sonne; and being <hi>Mediator,</hi> he cannot for that renounce his naturall love to him, which is the fundamentall cause, why hee loveth us for <hi>Christ</hi> his Sonne, as <hi>Mediator</hi>; but the love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Father</hi> loveth us for his Sonne <hi>Christ,</hi> is founded on free Grace and mercy; and might possibly never have been in <hi>God.</hi> For, 1. as he could not but beget his Sonne, he could not but love him; nature, not election can have place in either: but it was his Free will to create a man, or not create him. 2. He cannot but love his Sonne <hi>Christ,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> might either have loved neither man nor <hi>Angel,</hi> so as to chuse them to Salvation, and he might have chosen other Men and <hi>Angels,</hi> then these whom he hath chosen; <hi>God</hi> hath no such freedome in loving his owne <hi>Consubstantiall Sonne.</hi> 2. Its an untruth, that <hi>God</hi> loveth his chosen ones, as he doth love his Sonne; that is, with the same degree of love, wherewith he loves his Sonne; I thinke that not farre from either grosse ignorance, or blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. It possibly may bee the same love by proportion, with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44978:56"/>
which the Father tendereth the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> or <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and all his saved and ransomed ones; but in regard of willing good to the creature loved, he neither loveth his redeemed with the same love, wherewith hee loveth his Sonne; except blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously we say, <hi>God</hi> hath as highly exalted all the redeemed, and <hi>given to them a name above every name,</hi> as he hath done to his owne Sonne; nor doth he so love all his chosen ones, as hee conferreth equall grace and glory upon all alike; as if one starre differed not from ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The third reason is the same with the first, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth nothing but a Major Poposition, not denied by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted sinner, which is this: <hi>Who ever is justified and chosen, cannot be condemned; whom ever the Lord once loveth to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he must alwaies love to salvation</hi>; for his love is like himselfe, and changeth not.

               <p>
                  <hi>Because you feele not your selfe sanctified, you feare you are not justified. If you suppose that God takes in any part of your faith, repentance, new obedience, or sanctification, as a ground upon which he justifieth or forgiveth</hi> 1. <hi>you are cleare against the Word; for if it be of Workes, it is no more of Grace.</hi> 2. <hi>It must then be the onely evidence you seeke for; and you aske for sanctification to helpe your assurance of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: but take it in the Scriptures way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the Scriptures, Christ is revealed to be our sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Christ is made unto us righteousnesse, sanctification. I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. Yee are Christs, but yee are sanctified, but yee are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus. He hath quickned us together with Christ. Wee are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good workes.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44978:57"/>
Jesus Christ himself being the chiefe corner stone: That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that new man which after God was created in righteousnesse and true holinesse; Wee are members of his body, of his flesh, and his bones. And being found in him, not having mine own righteousnesse. I can d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e all things through Christ which strengthneth me. But Christ is all in all. Your life is hid with Christ in God,</hi> Heb. 13.20, 21. <hi>All these set forth Christ as our sanctification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fulnesse of his, the all in all. Christ hath beleeved perfectly for us, he hath sorrowed for sinne perfectly, he hath obeyed perfectly, he hath mortified sinne perfectly; and all is ours, and we are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The second thing is Faith about our owne sanctification we must beleeve more truth of our owne graces then we can see or feele: the Lord in his Dispensation hath so ordered, that here our life should be hid with Christ in God, that we should walke by faith, not by sight: So we are to beleeve our repentance true in him, who hath repented for us; our mortifying sinne true in him, through whom we are more then conquerors, our new obedience true in him, who hath obeyed for us, and is the end of the Law to every one that beleeveth, our change of the whole man true in him, who is righteousnesse and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And thus without faith, its unpossible to please God. This is Scripture-assurance to see every one in himselfe as nothing, and himselfe every thing in Christ, Faith is the ground of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen. All other assurances are rotten conclusions from the Word, invented by Legall Teachers not understanding the mystery of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ. The Scriptures bid you see nothing in your selfe, or all as nothing. These teachers bid you see something in your selfe: so as the leaving out Christ in Sanctification, is the foundation of all doubts, feares, distractions. And he that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on his repentance, on his love, on his humility, on his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and not in the tincture of the bloud of Christ, must needs beleeve weakely and vncomfortably.</hi>

               <p>If hee lay downe a principle that hee was never in <hi>Christ,</hi> because of such and such sinnes; you are not, who ever intends to cure him, to yeeld so much, and to deale with him according to a false supposall, as if hee were not in <hi>Christ</hi>: but must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to prove hee is in <hi>Christ</hi>; which to no purpose is done, by proving fair <hi>generalls,</hi> as <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> with other <hi>Libertines,</hi> doth; that is, you but till the sand, and beat the aire to prove, <hi>that Gods love is eternall,</hi> and his covenant and decree of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his chosen so stable and unalterable, as no sin can hinder the flowings of eternall love, when you make not sure to the man, that hee is loved with an everlasting love.</p>

The soule labouring under doubts whether <hi>God</hi> be his Father, is to hold off two rocks, either confiding or resting on duties, or neglecting of duties: the former is to make a <hi>Christ</hi> of duties; as if <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe were not more lovely and desirable,<note place="margin">

then a fleece of apples that groweth on it for the fourth part of a yeare. 2. Sinne, it must be to sue and woe the Kings Attendants and Courtiers by himselfe, or to make duties <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> but a Man-servant and Mediator to duties, sense, comfort, assurance, or the like. 3. The Whelps of the Beare are taken from her by swift riding away with them, and by casting down one of them, that shee may lose time in gaining the rest, while shee returneth back againe so many myles to bring that one to the den. And the smell of some delicious fields, they say, so taketh the dogs, that they forget the prey, and follow it no more. To smell so much in duties, and to be so sick and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in loving and resting on them, as to lie down in the way, and seek <hi>Christ</hi> no more, is doubtlesse a neglect of <hi>Christ.</hi> And thus high our Doctrine never advanced Sanctification, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned any acts, duties, or qualifications, under the notion of witnesses, or creators of peace or reconciliation; how our hearts may abuse them, is another thing.</p>

my love to the Saints, my keeping of his word, my holy walking in <hi>Christ,</hi> being the works of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> which dwelt in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> are <hi>actu primo,</hi> in themselves, as infallible signes of the Bridegromes love to me; as the Beloved's word <hi>who spake and said, Arise, my love:</hi> And if the spirations and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of the <hi>Spirit</hi> goe not along, both the voice and the love-bracelets (for <hi>Christ</hi> is no more counterfeit in his love-tokens, then in his word, when hee speaks as a Husband) are alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall to perswade the soule. I see no reason to call the workes of Sanctification <hi>inferiour helps</hi> in the Manifestation, more then the voice of the Beloved; for both without the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> are equally ineffectuall: and if the <hi>Spirit</hi> breathe and move with them, both are effectuall, <hi>&amp; actu primo, &amp; secundo,</hi> and they infallibly perswade. It is then a weake Argument, None can simply perswade <hi>Japhet</hi> but <hi>God; ergo,</hi> The word of the Bridegrome onely can infallibly perswade; or, therefore love-bracelets cannot infallibly perswade: for the word not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Spirit of Jesus,</hi> cannot simply perswade; and the <hi>Lords</hi> perswading of <hi>Japhet,</hi> is the <hi>Lords</hi> work of converting <hi>Japhet,</hi> not his enlightening of <hi>Japhet</hi> to know his faith to be true faith.

               <p>This is no proof at all, and a vaine consequence, <hi>without Faith its unpossible to please God,</hi> no worke can bee proved solidly <hi>Gods,</hi> without faith, but how then followeth it; <hi>Ergo,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove faith to bee true from good works. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> can make no Logicke out of this; nothing followeth from this ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, but <hi>ergo,</hi> by hypocriticall works done without faith, we cannot prove our faith to be true faith, <hi>valeat totum,</hi> the conclusion is not against us. Wee acknowledge, except good works carry the stampe and image of faith, they are not good works; but if they carry this stampe, as we presuppose they do, in this debate, because works are more sensible to us then faith it followeth well, then we may know our faith by our workes; and a beleever doing workes in faith, and out of warmenesse of love to <hi>Christ,</hi> and a sincere sense of his debt, he may bee ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that he doth them in faith, but a coale of love to <hi>Christ,</hi> smoaking in his soule, and the sincere sense of the debt that love layeth on him to doe that; yea, and to swimme through hell to pleasure <hi>Christ,</hi> are ordinarily more sensible then faith, and led us to know, there must be faith where these are.</p>

So the vitall acts of the life of Faith doe, as signes and effects give evidences of the cause and fountaine; yet there is no necessity that with the same light, by which I know the effect, I know the cause; because this is but a light of arguing, and of heavenly Logick, by which we know (by the light of the <hi>Spirits</hi> arguing) that we know <hi>God,</hi> by the light of Faith; because wee keep his Commandements: and know <hi>arguitivè,</hi> by <hi>Gods</hi> Logick, that we <hi>are translated from death to life, because wee love the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>; in effect we know, rather the person must bee justified, in whom these gracious evidences are, by heare-say, report, or consequence; then we know, or see justification it selfe, <hi>in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracto,</hi> or faith it selfe; but the light of faith, the testimony of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by the operation of free Grace, will cause us, as it were, with our eyes see justification and faith, not by report, but as we see the Sunne light.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44978:74"/>
peace at all. 2. The former peace is immediatly from pardon, that is the true cause of peace; the latter from signes, which dwell as neighbours with pardon; and is onely peace, as it hath a necessary relation to pardon; and is resolved in some promise of <hi>God,</hi> and not as it is a worke of our owne: as hungering for <hi>Christ,</hi> as its not the ground of pardon, so its not the ground of peace that issueth from pardon; yet it is the ground of a comfortable word of promise, <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for Righteousnesse, for they shall be satisfied.</hi> And the like, I say, of assurance, comfort, joy, that result from holy walking, and from justifying faith; we never placed good works in so eminent a place, as to ascribe these same effects to them, and to faith in <hi>Christ.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Minor is proved, Because when faith is hidden and doubtfull, sanctification is not evident: But when justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is hidden and doubtfull, faith is hidden and doubtfull; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>
                  <hi>The proofe of the Major is,</hi> 1. <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not seen; and so makes all things evident: then when faith is hidden, what can be cleare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Because no sanctification can be pure and sincere, but when it is wrought in faith; and so it cannot be evident, but when it clearely appeareth to be wrought in faith.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. There is in the Conclusion (first) the <hi>first</hi> evidence of justification, that is not in the premises, against all art. The Proposition, <hi>When sanctification is not evident, it cannot be an evidence of justification,</hi> is weake, and weakly proved: For there is a twofold evidence, one of sense and feeling spirituall, another of faith. When sanctification wants the evidence of faith, that I cannot beleeve salvation from mine owne Christian walking, yet may the soule have evidence of feeling and sense, that we trust we have a good conscience in all things, willing to live honestly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. and wee dare say, <hi>Lord, wee delight to doe thy will, and long for thee, O Lord, as the night-watch watcheth for the morning</hi>; and, <hi>whom have wee in heaven but thee, &amp;c.</hi> and can out of sense give a testimony of our selves, yea, and can place all <hi>our delight in the excellent ones,</hi> Psal. 16.3. &amp; 119.62. 1 Joh. 3.14. so as the heart warmes, when we see the Saints; and in this case sanctification is evident, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes may be under cloud; else this Argument does conclude, if it have any feet, that sanctification ever and at all times is dark, when justification is dark; and so sanctification is never an evidence of justification, but when justification is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: So the wisdome of <hi>God</hi> is taxed, as if hee would never have us to <hi>know that wee are translated from death to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee love the brethren,</hi> but when wee evidently know, wee are thus translated, though wee had no love to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Then the <hi>Lord</hi> hath provided a candle for his weak ones, by this Argument, when it is day-light; but hath deny'd any candle-light, moon-light, or star-light, when it is darke night. 2. The Major is not proved: Faith is not so the evidence of all things, as that it maketh all things evident to our spirituall sense; for <hi>Cornwell</hi> granteth, faith may be hidden; then it can evidence nothing when it is is hidden. Love to the brethren, keeping of his commandements, yeeld sensible evidences that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44978:76"/>
wee are justified, even when faith is not evident; and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are convinced they have undoubted marks of faith and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, who doubt of their faith and justification? And so the Minor and Probation of it is false; for it is most false, that <hi>when faith is hidden and doubtfull,</hi> sanctification is not evident: this is asserted <hi>gratis,</hi> not proved: As if yee would say, Ever when the Well-head is hidden, the streames are not seen; when the sap and life of the tree is not seen, but hidden, the apples, leaves and blossomes are not evident. This is a begging of the conclusion: for then should a man never, neither first nor last, <hi>know that hee is translated from death to life, because hee loves the brethren:</hi> Why? Because when translation from death to life, or when faith and justification is hidden, the love to the brethren, and all the works of sanctification are hidden; saith this <hi>Author.</hi>

                  <hi>The</hi> Minor <hi>is proved, because all the three, the Word, the Worke, and the light of Conscience, are all created blessings and gifts, and therefore cannot produce of themselves a word of almighty power; and the word of it selfe is a dead letter, the worke is lesse: for faith commeth by hearing a word, not by a worke.</hi>

Nor is here that which is in question concluded; never Protestant Divine taught, that without the actuall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of omnipotent Grace, can faith or spirituall sense that we are justified, be produced by the Word, worke, or created light alone; nor can the corne grow alone by power in the earth, clouds, or raine; nor any Creature move without the actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the <hi>omnipotent Lord,</hi> in whom we move: therefore by this reason we could not know that the Sunne shall rise, by the rising of the morning starre; nor can we have any superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall sense, by our holy walking, contrary to Scripture, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.3. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14.

There were two sights in <hi>Christ, one of Vision, another of Vnion</hi>; the <hi>sight of Vnion</hi> of two natures, is the cause of the <hi>sight of vision. Christ</hi> being on his journey travelling toward glory, did with a faith of dependency rest on <hi>God,</hi> as his Father, seeing and knowing that the Union could not be dissolved; but as a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensor,</hi> and one at the end of the race, injoying <hi>God</hi> in habit, there was no necessitie, that <hi>Christ</hi> should alwaies, <hi>Et in omni differentiâ temporis,</hi> actually see and enjoy <hi>God,</hi> in an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate vision of glory.</p>
               <p>For, 1. this implyeth no contradiction to the personall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>How the not-seeing of</hi> God <hi>might stand with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall union.</hi>
                  </note> even as the seeing of <hi>God</hi> habitually, which is the most joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sight intelligible, and by necessitie of nature, does produce joy and gladnesse, may, and did consist in <hi>Christ,</hi> with groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and sadnesse of <hi>Spirit,</hi> even before his last sufferings: so the interruption for a time, of the actuall vision of <hi>God,</hi> might stand with <hi>Christs</hi> personall happinesse, as <hi>God-man.</hi> 2. If we suppose there were just reasons, why <hi>God</hi> should command that <hi>Angels,</hi> and glorified <hi>Spirits,</hi> should not actually see <hi>God</hi> for a time, there were no repugnancy in this, to their true bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse, so it fell not out through their sinnes, no more then the Sunne should lose any of its nature, if wee suppose <hi>God</hi> should command it to stand still, and to be covered with darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse many dayes, as in <hi>Joshuahs</hi> time, it stood still in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment some houres, and for a time was covered with darkeness at the suffering of <hi>Christ.</hi> What an enterposed cloud of covering it was, or what a skreene did interrupt the flux of the beames and rayes of the <hi>Godhead</hi> from actuall irradiation on the soule and faculties, and powers of the soule of the man <hi>Christ</hi> is more then I can determine.

                  </note> These experiences may silence us; 1. It may be good that the <hi>Lord</hi> answer, and not good that hee answer now: The Saints are often ripe for praying, when they are unripe for the mercy of a reall answer and help from <hi>God.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Two things necessitate prayer, 1. Our duty to worship. 2. Our necessity and straits. But on our part wee are not ripe for an answer for any of these, being yet not humbled, and praying with slow desires, little fervour of faith. 2. Its possible it be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our duty to pray, as supposing a reall necessity of what wee need, and yet it is not our good that <hi>God</hi> heare us now. No doubt <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> both prayed for a son, many years before the one was an hundred, the other ninety and nine years old; but it was not good that <hi>God</hi> should heare them till it be a miracle, and a new way, and more then ordinary providence they were answered. 3. <hi>God</hi> refuseth never to heare us, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> favours that are non-fundamentalls toward everlasting life, but when its better be not heard, then heard: <hi>Moses</hi> might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not know a reason, but it was better for him that he saw afarre-off the good land, (more for faith and mortification and heavenly mindednesse, which hee saw not) then that hee should enter with the people into that land, which hee prayed for. 4. Not any of the <hi>Saints,</hi> considering that <hi>all things worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for good to them that love God,</hi> but as they praise <hi>God</hi> that hee hath heard their prayers, so they praise <hi>God</hi> in some things that their prayers lie at a fast bolted doore, and take it well in other things that hee was displeased with them, and so
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44978:79"/>
that they have cause to be humbled, that <hi>God</hi> did grant their desire. Let it be that <hi>David</hi> prayed for a sonne, and <hi>God</hi> gave him <hi>Absalom</hi>; its a question, if <hi>David</hi> had not cause to wish hee had never been born. 5. <hi>God</hi> hath equally regulated and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> limited our desires to be heard, and our willingnesse, faith, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and patience, and our praises according as we are heard, or not heard; yet wee are lesse in praises, when wee are heard, and our desires fulfilled, and in submission,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>We are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to pray then to praise.</hi>
                  </note> when wee are not heard, then wee are forward to praise; because necessity and straits can more easily obtaine of us to pray, and set on moving the wheels of our affections, then <hi>grace</hi> can keep our spirituall affections in heat of motion, or limit and border our naturall affections in praising, when they take them to their wings. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Psal. 22. Psal. 69. <hi>O my God, I cry night and day,</hi> till my throat be dry in asking: but where doth hee say, <hi>O my God, I praise night and day,</hi> till my throat be pained in praising, and my heart and eyes are wasted and spent in submissive waiting for thee, and praising, for not hearing mee in some things. 6. <hi>God</hi> is equally gracious to his own, in not hearing and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in fulfilling their desires. 7.

               <p n="4">4. Its true, the influence meritorious from <hi>Christs</hi> person on his suffering is not reall, but infinite in a morall estimation. But give me leave to thinke it disputable, whether or no, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not on the free decree and pleasure of <hi>God,</hi> that the punishment of sinne be infinite in duration, or if it depend on the nature of sinne, and of divine justice; so as essentially <hi>God</hi> be necessitated, not from any free decree (that is not properly necessitie) but essentially from that spotlesse and holy justice, which is essentially in him, to punish those who equally sinned on earth, with equall torments in <hi>hell,</hi> and all with eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Yet notwithstanding all this, <hi>Christ,</hi> by his death, not onely exhausted, the infinite punishment due to us; as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mountaines of Sands can drinke up all the finite Seas, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Brookes, and fountaines of the earth; but he purchased to

us an infinite and eternall weight of glory, by the worth of his merit, Now, by this there must be more in <hi>Christs</hi> death, then we can easily conceive: as it is more to bring <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> onely, and devide the red Sea, and to present them living men on the shore, then to doe that, and also to give them in peaceable possession, <hi>that good land which floweth with milke and honey</hi>; And its much to deliver a slave from perpetuall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, misery, and bondage; and not onely that, but positively to make him a rich, honourable, and glorious King; all which <hi>Christ</hi> by his bloud purchased to us: I leave it then to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, whether <hi>Christs</hi> sufferings had not onely a morall, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious and legall worthynesse, from the free act of <hi>Gods</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, or also an intrinsecall worth and weight, reall, and intrinsecally congruous, and proportionable to the paine and shame he delivered us from, and the glory that positively he conquesed for us.

                  </note>We have many diseases, in the matter of the returne of an answer. 1.

Wee are more

carefull, and troubled, that we are not heard, then anxious to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the rent, and pay the <hi>calves of our lips,</hi> in praying, which is <hi>Gods</hi> due. Were we as serious in worshipping in Prayer, as we are desirous of seeking wants, it were good; but there is more <hi>seeking</hi> in our Prayer, for our selves, then there is adoring for <hi>God.</hi> 4. We employ not <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>Mediator,</hi> and <hi>High Priest</hi> in praying, and exercising Faith so much, as we put forth pith and strength of words, that we may extort rather our needs, then obtaine grace; as if praying, and hearing of prayers, were worke and wages, rather then begging, and giving of meere grace. 5. We consider not when we pray, and prayer is not returned in the same coyne that we seeke; That the Father hearing <hi>Christs</hi> prayers, virtually, and meritoriously answered all our prayers in substance, and for our good. For, 1. <hi>Christ</hi> can cull out, and chuse petitions more necessary and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall for my salvation, then I can doe. 2. He is answered in all points; We are answered often in the generall, and in as good onely. 3. <hi>Christ</hi> could, with more submission and sense pray, then we can do. Nature in <hi>Christ</hi> cannot boast and compell <hi>God</hi> to heare prayers; Often our zeale is but naturall boasting and quarrelling, as if we could force <hi>God</hi> to answer. Grace in <hi>Christ</hi> (and grace is the most lowly, and modest thing of the world) prayes with all submission, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> 4. All prayers are hard for <hi>Christ, Ergo,</hi> his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are better heard, then the prayers of the Saints; except our prayers be folded in his prayers, they cannot be answered. The perfume, the sweet odours of <hi>Christs</hi> prayers are so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull and strong, as comming from <hi>God-man</hi> in one person, they must be both asking and giving, desiring and granting, praying and hearing, flowing from the same person, <hi>Christ.</hi> When our prayers goe to heaven; <hi>Christ,</hi> ere they come to the Father, must cast them in a new mould, and leaveth to them his heart, his mouth, though the Advocate taketh not the sense and meaning of the <hi>Spirit</hi> from them; yet <hi>Christ</hi> presenting them with his perfume, he removeth our corrupt sense, so as they are <hi>Christs</hi> prayers, rather then ours. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Let us by him</hi> (as our High Priest) <hi>offer the sacrifice of praise</hi> (then of prayers also) <hi>to God continually.</hi> The offering is the Priests, aswell as the peoples, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3. and farre more here, because <hi>Christ</hi>

And the Devils sinne was, that he did arrogate this to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that he was some thing, and would bee some thing, and that some thing was his, and in his right and power, this arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie to bee I, to my selfe to bee mee, and to bee mine, was Satans aversion and fall, and this is still in use.</hi> So this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</hi> Hell and the Devill cannot devise subtiller and vainer blasphemie; for so the creature is not the creature, the Devill is not a creature, not a Spirit, not a tempter, not <hi>the Prince of the ayre, not a roaring Lyon, not a lyar</hi>; and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in terming the <hi>Devill</hi> an <hi>Angel</hi> created in the truth should sinne. Its true, nothing hath being of it selfe, and independently, and as the cause of all being, but onely <hi>God</hi> the cause of causes, and prime fountaine of being, goodnesse, and actions: but hence it cannot follow, that creatures are not true beings, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of, and dependance from the first Ocean, fountaine, and cause of all being, and that goodnesse and actions, may not be ascribed to them from their derived being they have from <hi>God.</hi>

say, they can subsist, or doe keepe their being, without a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on <hi>God,</hi> the onely first essentiall being; but it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all truth, that they sinne, when they say, they are the creatures of <hi>God,</hi> and the dependent rayes and beames that flow from <hi>God,</hi> and the good creatures of <hi>God</hi> (though by created and dependant goodnesse) they neither lye, nor sinne, not commit any act of arogancie; then should it bee sinne to say that there were any creatures in the world, which is to belie the <hi>Scripture.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. There is something that is taking with reason, why a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> will not come to Christ; no man goes to Hell without hire,<note place="margin">

But the naturall man neither will, nor can chuse a kings life, and be a follower of Christ: nor is man any other then a naturall hater of Christ, though many thinke they beare Christ at good will; <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.24. <hi>But now they have seen, and hated both me and my Father.</hi> The reason why men thinke they love Christ, is the luster that education and common literall report, from the womb, hath put upon Christ; our fathers and teachers said ever, Christ is the Saviour of man, and a mercifull God, and therefore we have that common esteeme of him; but were wee borne of <hi>Jewish</hi> parents, or among <hi>Jewes,</hi>

(2.) Whence is it that the <hi>world</hi> hates the <hi>children of God?</hi> It is from instinct and nature, rather then from any imperated acts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Because yee are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</hi> Vers. 21. <hi>But all these things will they doe unto you, for my Names sake.</hi> To be <hi>chosen out of the world,</hi> to carry any thing of Christ and his image and

If then the world hate the Saints, as they doe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. and hate Christ, and hate the Saints upon this formall ground, Because they have in them the nature of God, the image of Christ,<note place="margin">

So Christ is the Sampler and Copy to all the Saints; therefore Christ must be more contrary to the wicked world, then the Saints are. If you hate the servant for the masters sake, then you hate the Master more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you love the nurse for the childs sake, then you love the child more. So the <hi>Jewes killed the servants, the Prophets, they stoned them, and beat them,</hi> Mat. 21.35. but they did more to Christ, <hi>Vers.</hi> 39. <hi>They caught him, slew him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and took the inheritance to themselves.</hi> (3.) Men naturally hate the wayes of God: If <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> there be holinesse in his wayes, then it must be most eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in God: If they esteem his yoke soure and heavie, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation a burden, then must they farre more esteeme so of himselfe.</p>

In this sense, it is most false, that the Promises <hi>are holden forth to sinners, as sinners</hi>; because then Christ should bee holden forth to all sinners, <hi>Americans, Indians,</hi> and sinners who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by the least rumor, heard one word of Christ. 2. <hi>Peter</hi> desires not <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to beleeve that God had loved him, in Christ Jesus, with an everlasting love; nor doth the Gospel-promise offer immediatly soule-rest to the hardened, and proud sinner, wallowing in his lusts, as hee is a hardened sinner; nor is the <hi>acceptable yeare of the Lord proclaimed,</hi> nor beauty and the oyle of joy offered immediatly to any, but to those who <hi>are weary and laden,</hi> and who <hi>mourne in Sion,</hi> and <hi>wallow in ashes, Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29, 30. <hi>Esay</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. Its true, to all within the visible Church, Christ is offered without price or money; but to be received after Christs fashion and order, not after our order; that is, after the soule is under selfe-despaire of salvation, and in the sinners moneth, when hee hath been with childe of hell.<note place="margin">

                  </note> I grant, in regard of time, sinners cannot come too soon to Christ, nor too early to Wisdome; but in regard of order, many come too soon, and unprepared. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> too soon beleeved. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, <hi>Hee mis-beleeved too soon; for he falsly beleeved: none can beleeve too soon.

                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:44978:148"/>
teach us the method of false-beleeving, when they teach us too soone to beleeve; that is, to beleeve that God hath loved you (be yee what yee will, <hi>Simon Magus, Judas,</hi> or others) with an everlasting love; for that is the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Faith. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is without any fore-going humiliation, or sense of sin, or selfe-despaire, to beleeve hee was no lesse written in the Lambs book of life from eternity, then <hi>Peter</hi>; and this hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve soon enough. I say, neither soon or late ought a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate to beleeve any such thing. A covetous man, who had great possessions, had not yet bidden fare-well to his old god <hi>Mammon,</hi> when hee came to Christ; therefore hee departed sad from Christ. Another came before hee had buried his father; and some come, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.28, 29. before they advise with their strength, and what Christ will cost them. I desire I be not mistaken: none can be throughly fitted for Christ, before hee come to Christ; but it is as true, some would buy the pearle before they sell all they have, which is not the wise Merchants part: and they erre fouly who argue thus, <hi>If I were not a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or if my sinnes were lesse hainous, and so I were lesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, I would come to Christ and beleeve; but ah, I am so grievous an offender, and so unworthy, that I cannot goe.</hi> Their Antecedent is true, but the Consequence is naught and wicked.

Another false ground is here laid by <hi>Libertines,</hi> That wee place worth and righteousnesse in Preparations; or, 2. That Preparations make us <hi>lesse unworthy, and lesse sinners.</hi> But Preparations are not in any sort to us money nor hire;<note place="margin">

                  </note> wee value them as dung, and sin; yet such sin, as sicknesse is in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to physick. 2. Preparations remove not one dram, or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of an ounce of guiltinesse, or sin. Christ, in practice of Free-grace, not by Law, yea not by promise, gives grace to the thus prepared, and often hee denyes it also: Yea, and there is a good houre appointed by God, when Christ comes. Other Physicians take diseases so early as they can, lest the malice of the disease over-come art; but Christ lets sin of purpose ripen, to the <hi>eleventh houre,</hi> often to the <hi>twelfth houre:</hi> Hee knowes his art can over-take and out-run <hi>seven devils,</hi> most easily.

Because it worketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the bowels of mercy, and the free grace of <hi>God</hi>; as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, cause, or moving condition, that doth extract acts of grace out of <hi>God,</hi> only we may conceive this order, that Grace of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to glory stirres another wheele, (to speak so) of free love to give Faith, effectuall calling, justification, and eternall glory. 2. Its no hire, nor work at all, nor doth it justifie, as a worke, but onely lay hold on the <hi>Lord our righteousnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>There is more of God in election to glory then in giving of Faith, or at least of Christs righteousnesse, and eternall glory; therfore there must bee more grace in the one, then in the other. The Antecedent is thus proved; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God simply, and absolutly, may chuse to glory</hi> Moses, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>or not chuse them to glory, and here is liberty of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and freedome, in the highest degree: but having once chosen</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Peter <hi>to glory; if they beleeve, the Lord
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:44978:152"/>
cannot but justifie them, and crown them with glory; because his promise and decree doth remove this liberty of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so as God cannot choose, but justifie and glorifie these that beleeve, both in regard of his immutable nature, who cannot repeale, what he hath once decreed, and of his fidelity, in that he cannot but stand to his owne word, and promise, in justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and saving the ungodly that beleeve. Againe, in election to glory, there is nothing of men, but all is pure free grace, no condition, no merit, no faith, no workes required in the party chosen to glory; but in the justified there is more of man, ere hee can be justified and saved, he must heare, consider, be humbled, know the need hee hath of a Saviour, and beleeve, and without these he cannot be justified.</hi>

And when will yee end? or come to an height? I know not. O be in Graces debt, and take the debt to eternity with you.</p>

               <p>Of the third Article. Touching the forme and nature and manner of drawing: 1. Its a question,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wherein the drawing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.</hi>
                  </note> Whether this drawing be Justification, or Sanctification? <hi>Antinomians</hi> say its both: But withall, both is one, (say they.)</p>
               <p>Answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Posit.</hi> 1. <hi>Drawing</hi> is relative to running and walking, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. Now this is rather in acts of Sanctification, and in <hi>running in the wayes of Gods commandements,</hi> Psal. 119.32. then in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, though <hi>coming</hi> goe for an act of beleeving and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. and so excludes not faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pos.</hi> 2. It is most unsound to affirme, that <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi> are all one;<note place="margin">Libertines <hi>falsly t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ach, that justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is one.</hi>
                  </note> for this must confound all acts flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Justification, with those that flow from Regeneration, or the infused habit of Sanctification. 1. Justification is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible act; the person is but once for all justified, by grace. But Sanctification is a continued daily act. 2. Justification doth not grow; the sinner is either freed from the guilt of sin, and justified, or not freed; there is not a third. But in Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, wee are said to grow in grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. and advance

in sanctification: nor is it ever consummate and perfect, so long as we beare about a body of sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pos.</hi> 3. To repent, to mortifie sin, is not to <hi>condemne all our works,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Town. <hi>Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace, pag</hi> 115, 116. <hi>Repentance and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are some other thing then Faith.</hi>

Because this is faith; and the Scripture saith, wee are justified by faith. 2. We receive Christ by faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. (3.) Wee receive and embrace the promise by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11. and were perswaded of them. 4. Wee are to beleeve without staggering, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19. (5.) Wee have peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science <hi>through faith,</hi> Rom. 5.1. (6.) <hi>By faith wee have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse into this grace, wherein wee stand,</hi> Rom. 5.2. And <hi>bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to enter into the holy of holiest, and draw neare to our High Priest, with full assurance of faith,</hi> Heb. 10.19, 20, 21, 22.

                  </gap>ication; wee neither receive Christ, nor embrace the promises by repentance. The <hi>Apostle</hi> requireth in repentance, sorrow, carefulnesse to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew sin, <hi>clearing, indignation, feare, zeale, desire, revenge,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10, 11. but no where doth the Scripture require this as an ingredient of repentance, that wee have boldnesse and accesse, and full assurance: nor doe <hi>Antinomians</hi> admit, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance wee have peace, or pardon, but this they ascribe to faith.</p>

                     <hi>How farre the Law draweth a sinner to Christ.</hi>
                  </note>A second Question is, How farre the Law can draw a sinner to Christ? <hi>Antinomians</hi> tell us of a Legall drawing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and of an Evangelike drawing; the Legall drawing, they say, is ours; the latter theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asser.</hi> 1. The difference between the letter of the Law, and the Gospel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Both Law and Gospel in the letter equally unable to draw a sinner to Christ.</hi>
                  </note> is not in the manner of working; for the letter of either Law or Gospel, is alike uneffectuall and fruitlesse to draw any to Christ. Christ preached the Gospel to hard-hearted <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> it moved them not. <hi>Moses</hi> preached the Law and the curses thereof to the stiffe-necked <hi>Jewes,</hi> and they were as little humbled. Sounds and syllables of ten <hi>hells,</hi> of twenty <hi>heavens</hi> and <hi>Gospels,</hi> without the <hi>Spirits</hi> working, are alike fruitlesse. And wee grant the Law is a sleepy Keeper of a captive sinner; hee may either steale away from his Keeper, or if hee be awed with his Keeper, hee is not kept from any spirituall, internall breach of the Law, nor moved thereby to sincere and spirituall
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44978:155"/>
walking. But the difference between <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> is not in the internall manner of working, but in two other things. 1. In the matter contained in <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel:</hi> because nature is refractory to violence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The difference betweene the Law and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not in that manner of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> and the <hi>Law</hi> can doe nothing but curse sinners, therefore it can draw no man to Christ. The <hi>Gospel</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine containes sweet and glorious promises of giving a new heart, to the elect; of admitting to the Prince of peace, laden and broken-hearted <hi>mourners in Sion</hi>; and in conferring on them a free imputed righteousnesse; and this is in it selfe a taking-way; but without the <hi>Gospel-spirit</hi> utterly ineffectuall. 2. To the <hi>Gospel</hi> there is a Spirit added, which worketh as God doth, with an omnipotent pull; and this Spirit doth also use the Law to prepare and humble; though this be by an higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then goeth along with the Law, as the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asser.</hi> 2. The <hi>Gospel-love</hi> of Christ freeth a captive from under the <hi>Law,</hi> as a <hi>Curser,</hi> and delivers him over to the <hi>Law,</hi>

                  </note> as to a <hi>Pedagogue</hi> to lead him to Christ, and as to an Instructer to rule and lead him when hee is come to Christ. <hi>Love</hi> is the immediate and nearest <hi>lord; Law</hi> the mediate and remote <hi>lord. Love</hi> biddeth the man doe all for Christ; the <hi>Law</hi> now of it selfe, because of our sinfulnesse, is a bitter and soure thing; but now the <hi>Law</hi> is dipped in Christs <hi>Gospel-love,</hi> and is sugared and honeyed, and evangelized with Free grace, and receives a new forme from Christ, and is become <hi>sweeter then the honey and the honey-combe,</hi> to draw and perswade: and all the Law is made a <hi>new Commandement of love,</hi> and a Gospel-yoak, sweet and easie; but still the Law obligeth justified men to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not onely for the matter of it, but for the supreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Lawgiver; now <hi>Christ,</hi> who came to fulfill, not to dissolve the Law, doth not remove this authority, but addeth a new bond of obligation, from the tye of Redemption in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and we are freed from the curse of the Law. 2.

                  </note> 1. The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power to command, direct, and regulate the creature to an end, in acts of righteousnesse and holinesse. 2. A secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary authority, to punish eternally the breakers of the Law, and to reward those that obey. These are two different things; suppose <hi>Adam</hi> had never sinned, the Law had been the Law;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:44978:156"/>
and suppose <hi>Adam</hi> had never obeyed, the Law also should have been the Law, and in the former case, there should have been no punishment, in the latter no reward. <hi>Antinomians</hi> confound these two. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Towne</hi> saith, <hi>It cannot be said, that my spirit doth that voluntarily,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 137.</note> 
                  <hi>which the command of the Law bindeth and forceth unto. It is one thing for a man at his owne free ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to keepe the Kings high way of the Law; and another to keepe it by pales and ditches, that he cannot without danger goe out of it.</hi> It cannot be denyed, but that the Gospel both chargeth or aweth us to beleeve in <hi>Christ,</hi> and to bring forth good fruits, worthy of <hi>Christ,</hi> except <hi>wee would bee hewen downe, and cast into the fire</hi>; and also that Grace worketh Faith, and to will, and to doe; and so voluntary obedience and obligation of a command, may as well consist, as bearing <hi>Christs</hi> yoak, and soule-rest; yea, and delight, and joy unspeakable, and glorious, may be and are in one regenerate person. <hi>Crisp</hi> and his followers are farre wide, for <hi>Christ</hi> dyed freely, out of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame love, and yet he dyed out of a command laid on him, to lay downe his life for his sheep, though no penall power was above <hi>Christs</hi> head, to punish him if he should not dye, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. Nor was there need of any power to force him <hi>sub penâ,</hi> or to awe him, if hee should not obey; so doe <hi>Angels,</hi> with wings of most exact willingnesse, obey <hi>God,</hi> yet are they under the authority of a Law, and command, but yet under no compelling punishment, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 103.20.21. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 104.4. So in the Saints love hath changed the chaines, not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Love hath made the Law silken cords; and whereas corrupt will was a wicked Landlord, and lust a lawlesse ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and the Law had a dominion over the sinner, in regard of the curse. Now the <hi>Spirit</hi> leades the will under the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power of the Law-giver, frees the sinner from the curse, and turnes forcing and cursing power in fetters of love; so that the <hi>Spirit</hi> draws the will sweetly to obey the same <hi>Lord,</hi> the same law, onely <hi>Christ</hi> hath taken the rod out of the Lawes hand, and the rod was broken and spent on his own back. The fewd betweene the Law and the sinner is not so irreconcilable, as the <hi>Antinomians</hi> conceive, so as it cannot bee removed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Law be destroyed, and the sinners free will loosed from law. It standeth in blessing, and cursing; salvation, and damnation: that are effects of the Law as observed, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44978:156"/>
Now, <hi>Christ was made a curse,</hi> and condemned to die for the sinner; all the rest of the Law remaines. It is most false that M. <hi>Towne</hi> saith, <hi>To justifie and condemne are as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and essentiall to the Law, as to command.</hi> 2. It is false that wee are freed from active obedience to the Morall Law, because Christ came under active obedience to the <hi>Morall Law</hi>; for the Law required obedience out of love. <hi>Antinomians</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, that wee are freed from obedience out of love; for it is cleare, <hi>Antinomians</hi> will have us oblieged by no Law to love our brother; to <hi>abstaine from worldly lusts, that warre against the soule</hi>; but in so doing, wee must seek to be justified by the works of the Law. This consequence wee deny. To keep one Ceremony of <hi>Moses</hi> drawes a bill on us of debt to keep all the Ceremoniall Law; because now its unlawfull in any sort. But to doe the duties of the Morall Law, as by Christ wee are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, layes no such debt on us, but testifies our thankfulnesse to Christ, as to our <hi>Husband and Redeemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other considerable thing here, is the way and manner of Christs drawing.</p>

                  </note> may be unknowne to many that are drawn. 1. In the very works of nature, the <hi>growing of bones in the womb,</hi> is a mystery; farre more <hi>the way of the Spirit,</hi> Eccles. 11.5. <hi>Know yee the ballancing of the clouds?

                  </note> 2. How God with one key of omnipotency hath opened so many millions of doores sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the Creation, and hath drawne so many to him, must be a mystery. There be many sundry locks, and many various turnings and throwings of the same key, and but one key. 1. Some Christ drawes by the heart, as <hi>Lydia, Matthew: Love</hi> sweetly and softly bloweth up the doore, and the King is within doores in the floore of the house before they be aware. Others Christ trailes and draggeth by violence, rather by the haire of the head, then by the heart, as the <hi>Jayler,</hi> Act. 16. and <hi>Saul,</hi> Act. 9. who are plunged over eares in hell, and pulled above water by the haire of the head: sure thousands doe weare a crowne of glory before the throne, who were never at making of themselves away by killing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44978:157"/>
as the <hi>Jayler</hi> was. A third sort know they are drawne, but how, or when, or the Mathematicall point of time, they know not: some are <hi>full of the Holy Ghost from the womb,</hi> as <hi>John Baptist.</hi> Yee must not cast off all, nor must Saints say they are none of Christs, because they cannot tell you histories and wonders of themselves, and of their owne conversion: some are drawne by miracles, some without miracles; the word of God is the Road-way. <hi>Arminians</hi> have no ground to deny that wee are irresistibly converted, because wee know not the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way how Omnipotency conspireth strongly, but sweetly, to win consent, without internall violence of our will, which so wills, as it may refuse. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. diverse times the <hi>Jewes</hi> aske the blind man, <hi>What did hee to thee, how opened hee thine eyes?</hi> Hee gives them one sure and true Answer, <hi>One thing I know, once I was blind, now I see.</hi> All can give this testimony, early or late, I know I am drawn. Its good the soule can say, Christ is here, I find him and feele him; but whether hee came in at the doore, or the window, or digged a hole in the wall, I know not. All may know they were blind as well as others, and <hi>by nature the children of wrath</hi>; as yee know <hi>Adam</hi> hath had a building in you, (though now yee <hi>be renewed in the spirit of the mind</hi>) by the old stones and rubbish in the house, and by the stirrings of the old man: When yee see the bones of a halfe dead man, and his grave, and find some warmnesse of life and heat, yee know there hath been life and strength in the man; so though yee cannot tell when Christ was first formed in you, yet yee find the bones and some warme bloud, and some life-stirring of concupiscence in the old man, though Christ have made his grave, and hee be well neare compleatly buried, and his one foot in the grave. God hath appointed a time for the coming of the Swallow; a season when flowers shall be on the earth, and when not; an houre when the sea shall be full tyde; but there is no set day, not a determinate and set summer known to us, when the wind shall blow up doores and locks of the soule, and Christ shall come in. But yet they are not Christs who neither know how they are drawn, nor can give any proofs that they are drawne. The Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Now wee have received not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that wee might know the things that are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to us of God.</hi> The converted can say, I was such a man,

                  <hi>Thy time was a time of loves.</hi> As a constellation is not one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle starre, but many; so the converted soule observeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, a bundle, an army of free loves, all in one cluster, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and growing upon one stalk: As to be borne where the voyce of the Turtle is heard in the land, its free love; to heare such a Sermon, free love; that the man spake such an excellent word, free love; that I was not sleeping when it was spoken, free love; that the Holy Ghost drove that word into the soule, as a <hi>nayle fastened by the Master of the assembly,</hi> it was free mercy: so that there's a meeting of shining favours of God, in obtaining mercy; and this would be observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asser.</hi> 2. There be two ordinary wayes of God, in drawing sinners: one <hi>Morall,</hi> by words; another <hi>Physicall and reall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Two wayes of drawing sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>; Morall, <hi>and</hi> Physicall.</note> by strong hand. Which may be cleared thus: Fancie, led with some gilding of apparent or seeming good, as hope of food, doth allure and draw the bird to the grin; and sometime pleasure, as a glasse, and the singing of the Fowler: So is fish drawne to nibble at the angle and lines cast out, hoping to get food. Now this is like <hi>Morall</hi> drawing in men; and all this is but <hi>objective,</hi> working on the fancy. But when the foot and wing of the bird is entangled with the net, and the fish hath swallowed down the bait, and an instrument of death under it, now the Fowler draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bird, and the Fisher the fish, a farre other way, even by reall violence. The <hi>Physician</hi> makes the sick child thirsty, then allures him to drink physick, under the notion of drink to quench his thirst: this is <hi>morall</hi> drawing of the child by wiles. But when the child hath drunk, the drink works not by wiles, or <hi>morally,</hi> but <hi>naturally,</hi> without freedome, and whether the child will or no, it purgeth head and stomack.</p>
               <p>That there is a <hi>Morall</hi> working by the word, in the drawing of sinners to Christ, though most evident, yet must be proved against <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> who <note n="(a)" place="margin">

To suck the brests of the consolations of Christ, and eat of the clusters that grow on that noble Vine <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and take them off the tree with your own hand, is a desireable and excellent thing. The more excellent the soyle is, the wines, the apples, the pomegranates, the roses, the lillies must be the more delicious; and the nearer the sun, the better; the more of summer, the more of day, the more excellent the fruits of the Land are: Beleeve it, the wines of that Paradise grow in a brave Land. O but Christ is a blessed soyle; roses and lillies, apples of love that are eternally summer-greene are sweet, that grow out of him: the honey of that Land, the honey of heaven, is more then honey; the honey of love, pure and unmixt, must be incomparable. 8.

The delectation we have in God as love-worthy to the understanding. For the drawing beauty of God, a word: 1. Of Gods beauty. 2. Of Gods beauty in Christ. 3. Of the relative beauty of God in Christ to <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels.</hi> 1.

So beauty formally is not in God, who hath not a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Nor speake we of Christs bodily beauty, as Man. Then beauty, by analogy, and eminently, must be in God: So as there be foure things in the creature to make up beauty to the bodily eyes,<note place="margin">

Hence heaven is a seeing of <hi>God</hi> face to face, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10. Now <hi>God</hi> hath not a face; but the face of a man is the most heavenly visible part in man, there is majestie and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in it, much of the art and goodlinesse of the creature is in his face.

Let us imagine that millions of Sunnes in the firmament, were all massed and framed in one Sunne, and that the sense of seeing that is in all men, that ever hath been, or may be, yet this Sun should far excell this faculty of seeing: so suppose that the Lord should create an understanding facultie of <hi>man</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> millions of degrees more vigorous and apprehensive, then if all the <hi>men</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> that are, or possibly may be created, were contemperated in one, yet could not this understanding so see <hi>Gods</hi> transcendent and superexcellent beauty, but there should remaine unseene treasures of lovelinesse never seene, yea, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves an eternall contradiction, that the creature can see to the bottome of the Creator.</p>

How commeth it to passe, that of two men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually called, and drawen to <hi>Christ,</hi> and as they dreame (but it is but a dreame) affected and instructed with habituall and prevening grace of foure degrees; the one man beleeves, and is converted; the other beleeves not, but resists the calling of <hi>God.</hi> They answer, <hi>Christ</hi> calleth, and draweth the one man, when he foresees he is better disposed, and shall obey; as his free will being in good blood, after sleep, and a good banquet, and fitter to weigh reasons, and compare the way of godlinesse with the other way: and he calleth the other, though both in regard of grace and nature, equall to him that is converted, when he foresees he is in that order of providence, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall indisposition, of sadnesse, sleepinesse, hunger, and extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall dispositions of minde, that he shall certainely resist, and both these callings, are ordered and regulated by the two abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute decrees of Election and Reprobation, from eternity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> answer right downe, the one is converted, because he wills, and consents; whereas he might,<note place="margin">

But this resolves heaven and hell, salvation and damnation, into such good or ill humours, and orders of providence, as a banquet, no ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, a crabbed disposition, or a merrie; whereas grace, which by an omnipotent and insuperable power removes the stony heart, can more easily remove these humours and win the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, when the man is decreed for glory, and besides that all men unconverted and in their own Element of corrupt nature are ill to speak to, and in a sinfull blood of resisting, except Christ tread upon their iron neck and subdue it, and <hi>he spreads the skirts of his love over Jerusalem at the worst,</hi> Ezek. 16.6.8.

for Davids house,</hi> in which our persons are washed; but that washing removeth the sinfull guilt, and Law-obligation from them, but not the inherent blot and sinfull imperfection of our works, to make them perfect; for then might wee be justified by our good workes, if Christs bloud make them to leave off to be sins; but that bloud hindereth them to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us only, but removeth not their sinfull imperfections, as <hi>Antinomians</hi> say, that so they may make us perfect in this life: nor doth that bloud (as <hi>Papists</hi> say) adde a meriting dignity and vertue to them, by which wee are justified by workes made white and meritorious in Christs bloud and merits. God hath so portraicted and chalked the way to heaven, that all the most supernaturall acts, even those that have immediate bordering with the vision of glory, should need a passe of pardoning grace; and to beleeve that Christs grace shall work in us acts voyd of sin, is not faith. Therefore wee are to beleeve the pardon of such ere they have being, and not sanctifying grace to eschew them. It seemeth to me unbeleeving murmuring to be cast down at these sins, in such a way as to imagine wee can eschew them, or that grace sanctifying is wanting to us in these; for grace is not due to sinlesse acts. Nor doth the growing in grace which lieth on us, by an obligation of a command, stop the way to the <hi>journeying toward perfection and heaven, nor shorten the cut to heaven, because heaven is not attainable in this life</hi>; but by the contrary, if perfection were attainable in this life, the man that attaineth it might sit down, rest there, and goe not one step farther; for except hee should goe beyond the crown, and to the other side of heaven, and over-journey Christ at the right hand of God, whither should hee goe?

And it is most considerable, how the soule in loving Christ is not her owne; and in regard of loving, Christ is not his owne, but every one makes over it selfe to another, and propriety or interest to it selfe in both sides (as it were) ceaseth, <hi>Hos.</hi> 3.3. <hi>And I said unto her, thou shalt abide for mee many dayes, thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not bee for another man, so will I also be for thee</hi>; so the Mariage covenant of grace saith: <hi>I will be your God, and yee shall be my people.</hi> And the Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. <hi>My well-beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> It is true, Christ leaveth not off to be his owne, or to be a free <hi>God</hi> when hee becomes ours; but hee demeaneth himselfe, as if he were not his owne, and putteth on relations, and assumeth offices of engagement; <hi>a Saviour, an Annointed, a Redeemer, a King, a Priest, a Prophet, a Shepherd, a Husband, a Ransomer, a Friend, a Head, a guide,</hi> and <hi>leader of the people,</hi> all which are for us: and the soule injoying <hi>Christ,</hi> possesseth <hi>Christ,</hi> and not it selfe; loveth <hi>Christ,</hi> not it selfe; liveth in <hi>Christ,</hi> not in it selfe; injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Christ,</hi> not it selfe; solaceth it selfe in <hi>Christ,</hi> not in it selfe; beholdeth <hi>Christ</hi> and his beauty, not it selfe, nor his owne beauty; so that mind, will, love, desire, hope, joy, sight, wondring, delighting, are all over in <hi>Christ,</hi> not in it selfe.

               <p>The <hi>Question</hi> toucheth, 1. <hi>Gods</hi> intention and purpose to save man. 2. In chusing some to salvation, not others. 3. <hi>Gods</hi> purpose in sending Christ to dye for some, not for others.</p>
               <p>The first Article is called universall grace, the second condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall; or which to me is all one, vniversall election to glory, and so no Election. The third is, the question touching the universalitie of Christs death, or a fancied <hi>universall attonment</hi> made by Christ for all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot particularly handle all the three.</p>

No man living on earth, but he is beholding to Christ (though many know him not) for common helps of providence, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences do teach him some more of God by nature. 3.

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:44978:208"/>
you, if yee believe. 2. A salvation purchased by Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an efficacious intention in God to apply it to all, and every one is no lesse a shadow and a very nothing, then the salvation purchased to all and every one, and this maketh as much against <hi>Arminians,</hi> as against us. Now sure salvation is purchased with an efficacious intention in God to apply it to those only who shall be saved, and the smallest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. 3. This way sendeth me at first to beleeve Gods se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and efficacious good-will to save me by name, before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I beleeve the Gospel, That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> came to save all beleevers, which is no Gospel-order of beleeving; and raiseth in my mind jealousies against Christ, that he out of his love died for mee, but putteth mee on a ground of doubting, if he will apply his death to me, except I begin first to love him and with free-will apply Christ, so Christ first extendeth raw wishes to save me, but I must extend to him reall deeds of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, by faith, his wishing and halfe-love to me, and the most reall kindness begins at me, not at Christ.</p>
               <p>But say I by what Scripture is a naked power to justifie, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, wash, sprinkle sinners, and such a power which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with the eternall perishing of all men, (saith <hi>Moor</hi> p. 5. with the <hi>Arminians</hi>) an eternall perfect Redemption, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect satisfaction of justice and the Law of God? Are not so the sins of the world taken away, and yet they remain? Doth not Christ bear the sins of all the world; yet it may fall out, that all the world bear their own sins, and not one man bee saved; yea, as it is, the greatest part of mankind bear their own iniquities, die in these same sins that were imputed to Christ, suffer the curses of the Law which Christ suffered for them.</p>
               <p>Yea, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Moor</hi> saith, <hi>Gods reconciling of the world, and his not imputing their sins to them,</hi> is the reconciling of all <hi>Adams</hi> sons in Christs bodie before God; yet <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> both say, <hi>Blessed are they to whom the Lord imputes no sin. Moor</hi> saith, a whole world to whom the Lord imputeth no sin, may be under the curse of the second death. 2. To put reconciling of the world to God, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. for <hi>the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling of Christ in his owne bodie with God,</hi> as M. <hi>Moor</hi> doth, is strange divinity; for it is reconciling of God to man, in stead of a reconciling of man to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. and cannot be meant of <hi>only reconciling of God in Christs body, or of obtaining only of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:44978:208"/>
without application.</hi> 1. Because the blood of Christ is compared with the blood of Buls and Goats, which was offered for the reconciling of men to God, not of God to men. 2. Because that blood is <hi>said to sanctifie and purge the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from dead works to serve the living God,</hi> which cannot be said of God, but clearly holdeth forth, that Christ having offered himselfe without spot to God, through the eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, those for whom he offereth himself, cannot eternally pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, as M. <hi>Moor</hi> saith p. 5. but that their consciences, by this <hi>blood are purged from dead works to serve the living God.</hi>

What certaintie of faith have <hi>Arminians</hi> to pray for all? Or for the twenty, or hundreth part of all mankinde? This therefore is denyed. <hi>Christ gave himselfe for as many, as we are to pray for, but we are to pray for all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception.</hi> The proposition and the assumption both are false, nor doth our prayers for men, depend on the certitude of Gods decree of election of men to glory, which is Gods secret will not knowne to us, to whom the Lambes booke of life is not opened, but on the revealed will of <hi>God,</hi> commanding us to pray for all, that sinne not to death, but conditionally, and with a speciall reserve of the <hi>Lords decrees of Election,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation</hi>; and this in effect, is to pray for the Elect only; nor am I warranted, by the Word of <hi>God,</hi> the rule of my prayers,<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="6">6. Most abominable, and comfortlesse, must the doctrine of the death of our <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> be; if Christ died onely to bee a <hi>Lord,</hi> and such a <hi>Lord,</hi> as hee might have power; without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of revenging justice, to save men upon a new trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, either of grace or works; and to destroy his enemies that would not accept of that new transaction, yet so as when <hi>Christ</hi> hath dyed, and taken away the sinnes of all, and is made <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of dead and quick; all mankinde may freely reject all covenants <hi>Christ</hi> maketh, or can make, and be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost, and perish.</p>

                  </note> that hee hath acquired by death, is not a free-will-power or possibility, by which, he may, upon such and such conditions, kill, or save, though all may eternally perish. But <hi>Christ is made Lord of quick and dead,</hi> by dying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. that he might be judge of all; but so, that we should <hi>live and dye to our selves,</hi> but <hi>that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we live or dye we should be Christs</hi>; though we change con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, yet not Masters in both, <hi>we should be the Lords,</hi> v. 7.8. as <hi>Christ</hi> lived againe after death, that hee might bee the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of his owne wife, the <hi>Church,</hi> that hee dyed of love for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon what termes <hi>Christ</hi> was by death, made a Lord, and acquired a Princedome, upon these termes he was made a Prince over his Church; for <hi>Lord,</hi> and Prince, and King, are all one. But the <hi>Lord</hi> maketh <hi>David,</hi> that is <hi>Jesus the Sonne of David,</hi> Prince over his people, not with power to save or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy his redeemed slocke, and so as all the slock may eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perish. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 34.22. <hi>Therefore will I save my slocke, and they shall no more be a prey.</hi>—Vers. 23. <hi>And I will set one Shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, and my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant David hee shall feed them, and he shall be their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</hi> Vers. 24. <hi>And I the Lord will be their</hi> God, <hi>and my servant David a Prince among them, I the Lord have spoken it.</hi> Vers. 25. <hi>And I will make with them a covenant of peace.</hi>

Now was Christ by the bloud of the eternall covenant, brought back from the death, and made a Shepherd of soules, to the end he might have power to destroy all the slock? <hi>Ezechiel</hi> saith, to feed them, the <hi>Apostle,</hi> to <hi>make the Saints perfect in every good worke, working in them (actually and efficaciously) that which is wel-pleasing in his sight,</hi> Heb. 13.20, 21. Its true, <hi>Christ</hi> obtaineth by his death a mediatory power to crush as a Potters clay vessell, with a rod of yron, all his rebellious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But 1. this is not a power to crush any enemies, but such as have heard of the Gospel, and will not have <hi>Christ</hi> to raigne over them, in his Gospel-government; but not to crush all his enemies, that never heard of the Gospel, and so are not Evangelically guilty in sinning against the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> as <hi>Mediator,</hi> for they cannot be guilty of any such sinne. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22. Hee had, and hath power as <hi>God,</hi> equall with the Father, to judge and punish all such as have sinned without the Law. 2. Its not merit, or acquired by way of merit of <hi>Christs</hi> death, that a Crown is given to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> for this end, to destroy such enemies as are not capable of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against his Mediatorie Crowne, especially, when as <hi>God,</hi> he had power to destroy them, as his enemies, though hee had never been <hi>Mediator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Its said, him</hi> (whom yee slew, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a tree) <hi>hath God exalted, with his right hand, to bee a Prince and Saviour,</hi> (not to destroy all his subjects, upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene condition of rebellion, to which they were, through corruption of nature, inclinable) but that he might by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, subdue corruption of nature, <hi>and give repentance to Israel and forgivenesse of sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By what title <hi>Christ</hi> is made a <hi>King and Lord,</hi> by the same he is made head of the body the Church.

               <p n="4">4. By the same title he is made <hi>Lord,</hi> by which hee is made <hi>King, Governour, and Leader</hi> of the people; for power

of Dominion and Lordship is nothing but Royall power, now he was made King, not on such termes, as hee might destroy all his subjects, (for all mankind are his subjects to <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>) But he is made King, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.11. <hi>That all Nations may serve him</hi>; that <hi>hee should deliver the poore, needy, and helplesse; and redeeme their soules from violence, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme their death precious, and he raigneth and prospereth as a King, that in his dayes Judah may be saved, and Israel dwell safely,</hi> Jer. 23.7.8. and <hi>God raiseth the horne of David,</hi> Luk. 1. And so <hi>setteth Christ on the throne to performe his mercy promised to our Fathers, and remember his holy covenant.</hi> Ver. 69.7. <hi>That wee might serve him in holynesse and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Now by the <hi>Arminian</hi> way, he is set upon the throne of <hi>David</hi> to execute vengeance on all his Subjects and that he may utterly destroy all, if all rebell, and not to save one of <hi>Judah and Israel</hi>; for he may be a King without any subject; suppose all his Subjects were cast in hell; yea, hee groweth <hi>out of the root of Jesse,</hi> a Royall branch of <hi>King Davids house</hi>; not that these Warres may bee perpetuated betweene <hi>God</hi> and all the children of men: but that <hi>the Wolfe should dwell with the Lambe, and the Leopard lye down with the Kid, and the Calfe, and the young Lyon together, and a little Childe should lead them, and the earth should be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea,</hi> Isai 11.1, 2. — 6.7, 8, 9.

and so the specifick acts of this husband, who is joyned to us, by the marriage-covenant of free grace, must bee free love to his Spouse; as <hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.25. and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fruit, and end of Marriage, is that the <hi>Spouse</hi> might have interest in the righteousnesse, glory, spirit, wisdome, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, the kingdome and throne of the <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> not that hee might condemne and destroy his Spouse.</p>

And this <hi>Arminian</hi> way over-turneth the whole Gospel, which is a bargaine of blood, between the Father and the son Christ, and Christ dying and justifying, <hi>pardoning the iniquities of his people,</hi> making them heires of the same Covenant and Kingdome with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, is in this Indenture of free Grace, the chiefe man: Now unpossible it is that this can be an effect of Christs death, that he may set up a covenant of grace, and a Gospel-way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or set up another way; when as by the Gospel-covenant only God gave Christ a body, indented with him to doe the worke, to make his soule an offering for sin; and God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to him if he would die, <hi>a seed; and that the pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand, that his soule should be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that he should justifie many, intercede for many, Isai.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12, 13. Now if all might eternally perish, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that Christ died for them, and it were free to Christ to make such a Covenant after his death, in which not one man possibly may be saved.

                  <hi>These for whom Christ laid down his life, and have ground of assurance of hope, and comfort in Christs death and in the Gospel promises, are not all men and all sinners, but only some few handfull of chosen ones, by name, such as</hi> Abraham, David, Peter, Mary, Hannah, &amp;c. <hi>and not one more, not any other.</hi>

God must so be the cause &amp; only cause of all our sinfull omissions, &amp; sins under the Covenant of grace, in that he promiseth to work in us to will and to do, &amp; to give us grace to abstain fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin, but does not stand to his word as <hi>Antinomians</hi> teach, which is an Argument unanswerable to me, that its the minde of <hi>Antinomians</hi> that no justified person can sinne, but that they omit good, or commit ill, God is in the fault, not they; and that the justified are meer blocks in all the course of their sanctification; in all the sins they doe, they are patients; God should more carefully see to his own honour, and not suffer them to sinne; so they and the old <hi>Libertines</hi> goe on together. For say, that the new heart, that to will and to doe, to persevere stedfastly in the Grace of God, were no conditions of the Covenant (sure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the Lord Iesus is clearly a condition of the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of faith, as doing is of the righteousnesse which is of the Law,</hi> Rom. 10.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

The earth was Christs prison, he could not escape out of it, till he payed his sweet life for it; only two that we read of, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> left the earth, and went to heaven and <hi>saw not death</hi>; these that <hi>shall be changed</hi> and <hi>shall not die,</hi> at Christs comming have this priviledge; but otherwise all have a bruise in the heel, ere they goe out of earth. 2. When Christ was on his journey, he was not so much in love with the earth, as to repent and turn back again; as Christs head and face was toward heaven,<note place="margin">Grounds of leaving of the earth.</note> so his heart and soule followed, hee went from the Crosse straight way to Paradise. 3.

               <p>In finding the meaning of scripture, these considerations may give light.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture in the plainest expressions is dark, that is,<note place="margin">The Scripture plain.</note> high and deepe in regard of the matter which is deepe; high, above the reach of reason, and yet the language plaine, obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous easie, that a virgin shall be a mother, the antient of dayes a young sucking infant; that through one man, death digged a hole in the world, and sinne passed on all; through a second Man life and heaven entered again;<note place="margin">The matter of the Scripture deep and high but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure as Papists say.</note> are high and deepe myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet is not the Gospel obscure, as Papists say.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In meer historicall narrations and prophecies foretelling the wars of the Lamb, the Dragon and the Beast, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, their persuing the woman in traveling in birth, to bring forth a man child, the matter subject is not profound, nor deepe, yet the expressions are dark and covered, while the
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:44978:306"/>
works of the Lord bee a key to open his word; Here's the wisdome of God, that in deepe and high mysteries necessary for salvation, the Lord is plaine, and lower and easier stories are foretold more darkly; articles of faith are not set downe in dark and enigmaticall prophesies, but plainly, whereas histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of things to come are more mysteriously proposed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture in no place is in the popish sense dark, that is, that we are not to take any sense for the word of life, and the object of our faith, but that which the Church giveth as the sense, in regard the Scripture is a nose of wax, with equall propension to contradictory senses, except the mistris of our faith, the witch of <hi>Babel</hi> expound it, and then it is for such formally the word of God, as she expoundeth it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The holy Ghost the Authour of Scripture has concrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the words, the true native sense, which all the powers on earth cannot alter.</p>

               <p>Violence, it is to die of any disease or of paine: 1. But when five or six deaths do all start equally at one land-port, and at one race, and strive which of them shall dispatch the poore man soonest, the paine is the more; yee know the complaint of our <hi>blessed Saviour,</hi> Psal. 22.16. <hi>They pierced my hands and my feet,</hi> and Ioh. 19.34. <hi>one of the souldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out bloud and water:</hi>

Now a violent death it must be when strong and great nailes did pierce the most nervous parts of his body, his hands and his feet; one Iron wedge thrust in at his left pape, to pierce his heart, or to pierce through the temples of the head would quickly have dispatched him. 2. As for the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his death, foure leasurely and slow violent deaths to cause him to bleed to death were hard: the word saith the bloud is the life of the living creature; then look how long his bloud was comming out, his life was dropping out as long.

               <p>I answer, 2. to that: <hi>That which is inchoat sinfully defective, and imcompleat, that the righteous and unchangeable God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not account perfect and compleat, or that which is sinfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, or that which is sinfull, God cannot account not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>; It is true, it were an erroneous and unjust account; now the proposition is true; but the assumption most false; the good works of the regenerate and justified are sinfull. But Gods accounting of them perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> putteth no contradiction on them to account them not sinfull: God accounts not <hi>Davids</hi> adultery to bee an act of chastity; This is the Papists ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against the imputed righteousnesse of Christ, which <hi>Antinomians</hi> being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> utterly ignorant of the nature of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, bring against us; the other part of the distinction is, <hi>That which is sinfull and defective in it selfe,</hi> and inherently, or really and physically, that God cannot account perfect, that is, God cannot account it and the doer, legally free from obligation to eternall wrath, for the satisfaction of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the surety of sinners, who has payd and suffered for it; that is most false, and should destroy the Protestant justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, when we say God accounteth the good works of believers good and perfect, so as the imperfection and sinne of them is removed; we meane not by removing of the sinne of these works, the totall annihilation of sinne, in its essence

Now that the fruits and the tree are both good, and simply perfect and all the works of the justified perfect in Christ, is a point of new divinity very contrary, first to Scripture which saith <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>in many things we offend all,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we say wee have no sinne, we deceive our selves,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>If we say we have not sinned, we make him a lyar, and his word is not in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Antinomians</hi> say, <hi>Iohn</hi> speaking of a mixt multitude, is to bee meant to speak of the unregenerate mixed with the justified.</p>
