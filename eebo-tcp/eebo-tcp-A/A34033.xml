         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The Nobility of this queſtion is celebrated by the Learned of

            <p>By which expreſsion of this Jeſuit, appears the immenſe uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

ſince the Biſhop of <hi>Rome, in Cathedra,</hi> (and conſequently in
their opinion infallible) pronounceth ſo. On the contrary, if the
Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> be a thing unknown to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Antiquity, it is as certain, <hi>that the Faith of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Roman Church, is a new deviſed cheat and idolatry.</hi>
That this followeth of neceſſity, appears by the confeſſion of
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, in two expreſſions in the preface of thoſe
Books of his, <hi>de pontifice Romano:</hi> The firſt we now mentioned,
in which he calls that Controverſie of the Popes ſupremacy,
<hi>a Deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te de ſumma rei Chriſtianae,</hi> That is, <hi>whether the
Chriſtian Religion can ſubſiſt or not?</hi> By <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi>
no queſtion, he means, <hi>the Faith of the modern Church of</hi>
Rome; and conſequently he grants, that they who call in
queſtion <hi>the Popes ſupremacy,</hi> they queſtion alſo, the whole body
of the Popiſh Religion: And conſequently ſtill he muſt of neceſſity
grant, that if the <hi>Popes ſupremacy</hi> be deſtitute of <hi>Scripture</hi> and
<hi>Antiquity,</hi> the faith of the Modern Church of <hi>Rome</hi> falls with
it, and proves <hi>a new deviſed fiction.</hi> His ſecond expreſſion is,
in thoſe ſimilitudes he uſeth, to illuſtrat his aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> He
compares Religion, without the Popes ſupremacy (which in his
opinion, is that of the Modern Church of <hi>Rome) to a Houſe
without a Foundation, a Body without a Head, Moon-ſhine,
without the Sun:</hi> And ſince it is notorious, that a houſe without
a Foundation cannot ſtand, that a Body without a Head cannot
live, that the Moon without light of the Sun, muſt be obſcured; He
muſt of neceſsity grant, that the Supremacy of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> being refuted by Scripture and Antiquity, the Faith and
Religion of the Modern Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is warrantable by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and conſequently, proves <hi>a new deviſed idolatrous cheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, its a moſt pleaſant conteſt; what can be more pleaſing,
then to conſider the cauſes of any <hi>prodigious Monſter?</hi> how i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſubſiſts? and how it is deſtroyed? how any illuſtrious cheat is
<pb facs="tcp:64826:6"/>
contrived? how it is maintained? and how it is diſcovered?
But ſuch a <hi>Monſter,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Cheat</hi> as the <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome, none
free of prejudice can behold without admiration. The whole
world ſees a perſon, now ignorant, then flagitious, not ſeldome
both, put by two or three Italians <hi>of the ſame mettal,</hi> in the Chair
of <hi>Rome:</hi> which Preferment he obtains, ſometimes by <hi>blood,</hi>
ſometimes by <hi>ſimonie,</hi> ſometimes by <hi>unlawful ſtipulations,</hi> as
<hi>to protect Hereſie, and to oppreſs the Catholick Faith;</hi> not
ſeldome <hi>by a paction with the Devil</hi> (all which wayes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Chair of <hi>Rome,</hi> are confeſſed by Popiſh Writers,
ſuch as <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> as ſhall be proved in the following
Diſpute) Which <hi>Homuncio</hi> is no ſooner inſtalled, then he is
metamorphoſed to be <hi>direct Monarch of the whole World, both
in Spirituals and Temporals.</hi> And firſt for <hi>Temporals,</hi> it ſhall
be proved in the following Diſpute, that he aſſumes to himſelf in
his Bulls, <hi>power of transferring Kingdoms at his pleaſure, of
ſtirring up Subjects to Armes againſt their natural Princes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pain of Excommunication.</hi> It ſhall be proved, that he
makes Emperours and Kings lye proſtrate till he <hi>trade upon their
neck;</hi> makes them ſtand <hi>bare-footed,</hi> with their Wives and
Children, in froſt and ſnow, <hi>dancing attendants at his Gates,</hi>
and yet not not admitted entrance. It ſhall be proved, that he
makes Laws, (in that Book entituled, <hi>Sacred Ceremonies)
that Emperors and Kings ſhould hold his Stirrup, hold water
to his Hands, ſerve diſhes at his Table, carry him on their
ſhoulders:</hi> Yea it ſhall be proved, that it is the Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>Rome, That all Kings are not only the Popes Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals,</hi>
but which is more, he is not oblieged by any mutual on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
to ſuffer them to poſſeſs their Kingdoms, but during his
pleaſure; that is, he may lawfully depoſe them, although they
miſcarry not in the leaſt: In which he doth t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em no wrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they hold their Kingdoms <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f him, <hi>not as Vaſſals,</hi> but as
<hi>depoſitars;</hi> as when any gives to another <hi>his Cloak to keep,</hi>
when he re-demands it, he doth him no wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64826:6"/>
As for his power, which he aſſumes to himſelf in Spirituals,
it cannot be repeated without horrour. It ſhall be proved in the
following Diſpute, that it is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
partly in the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> partly in <hi>the Bulls of Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
partly in <hi>Books printed by the Popes Authority, and
affirmed by his V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſitors to contain nothing contrary to the
Catholick Faith;</hi> That the Pope has power <hi>to coyn Articles of
Faith at his pleaſure, oblieging the whole Church, under the
pain of damnation, although he command vice, and forbid
vertue.</hi> Secondly, although he ſhould lead all the world to hell
with him, yet none ſhould preſume to diſobey him. Thirdly, that
he gives pardon for ſin <hi>for money;</hi> and not only of ſins by-paſt,
but alſo of thoſe <hi>to come:</hi> that is, for a little money, he will give
you pardon for a little time; but for a round ſum, he will give
you pardon ſo long as you pleaſe. Fourthly, it ſhall be proved,
that for money, <hi>he permits men to ſin;</hi> that is, permits <hi>Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to keep Whoores:</hi> And if any <hi>keep not a Whoor,</hi> he
makes them pay for it in ſome places of <hi>Italy</hi> nevertheleſs, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have liberty to keep a Whoor, if they pleaſe.
Cornelius Agrippa</hi> affirms, he heard ſuch expreſsions as theſe
following, in the Popes Court, <hi>Habeat aut non habeat Meretri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,
Aureum ſolvat, quia habet ſi velit:</hi> That is, <hi>Whether a
Prieſt keep a Whoor or not, let him pay the Tribute, ſince he
may keep one if he pleaſe, for ſuch a peece of money.</hi> Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he makes his <hi>decretal Epiſtles of equal authority with
the Scripture.</hi> Laſtly, as he intended <hi>a gigantomachy,</hi> he is
called in the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> reviſed and authoriſed by <hi>Gregory, 13.
Our Lord God the Pope.</hi> It is affirmed in the ſaid Law, <hi>that
he has power to make injuſtice juſtice,</hi> and contra <hi>that he has
power to command the Angels to carry ſouls to Heaven at
his pleaſure;</hi> that he has power <hi>to give liberty to men to place
the departed Souls of their friends in paradiſe for money:</hi> that
by vertue of his ſucceſsion to <hi>Peter,</hi> he is aſſumed <hi>to the ſociety
<pb facs="tcp:64826:7"/>
of the individual Trinity;</hi> he not only <hi>hears patiently,</hi> but alſo
<hi>rewards flatterers,</hi> when <hi>their blaſphemous Pamphlets</hi> prefer
him to Chriſt; as appears in <hi>Innocent</hi> 10. which paſſage ſhall
be realated <hi>part 1. lib. 1. cap. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> of this following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> any would think theſe horrible
paſſages incredible, but have patience till ye hear them proved,
partly by the Canon Law, partly by the <hi>decretals of Popes,</hi>
partly by Books authorized by the Popes authority, partly <hi>per res
judicatas, or ſentences paſſed in the Popes Court at</hi> Rome.
Ignorants of antiquity, (of which our adverſaries bragg ſo
much) believe that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſuch immenſe and
unlimitated power, in all Ages, by reaſon <hi>of his ſucceſſion to</hi>
Peter <hi>in the Monarchy of the Church:</hi> What can be more
pleaſing, then to conſider, from what ſmall beginnings? at what
times? upon what occaſions? by what ſteps? by what artifices he
mounted to ſuch <hi>a prodigious hight?</hi> and by what practiſes
he maintains himſelf in it? all which is to the life delineated,
in this following Diſpute, and proved by uncorrupted a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable
teſtimonies of the Ancients: In which alſo it will
appear, that all what our adverſary pretends from antiquity, to
maintain the Popes Kingdom, is either ſophiſtically preverted,
falſly tranſlated or cited, mutilated or forged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> Whereas they make the <hi>Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
of</hi> Peter <hi>the only</hi> baſis <hi>and foundation of the Popes power,</hi>
in the firſt place, ye will find, that the Monarchy of <hi>Peter</hi> was never
dreamed of, <hi>by the Ancients of the firſt ſixth Centuries.</hi> As for
his particular <hi>Biſhoprick of</hi> Rome, although ſome of the Fathers
affirm <hi>he was Biſhop of</hi> Rome, yet your Lordſhips will find it
proved, that they call <hi>Paul Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>in the ſame ſenſe;</hi>
and conſequently they take the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> in a large ſenſe, as it
comprehends an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and not <hi>properly,</hi> for a <hi>Biſhop tyed
to any particular Congregation.</hi> That this is their meaning,
<pb facs="tcp:64826:7"/>
will be proved by two invincible reaſons; the firſt is, becauſe
theſe ſame Fathers, in their Catalogues of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi>
do not reckon <hi>Peter</hi> in that number, making <hi>Linus</hi> the firſt Biſhop
of <hi>Rome, Cletus</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Clement</hi> the third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if
they had believed <hi>Peter was Biſhop of</hi> Rome, they would have
called him <hi>the firſt Biſhop,</hi> Linus <hi>the ſecond,</hi> Cletus <hi>the third,</hi>
Clement <hi>the fourth,</hi> &amp;c. The ſecond reaſon is, That it ſhall be
proved by the teſtimonies of thoſe very men, who call <hi>Peter Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of</hi> Rome, That firſt <hi>Linus,</hi> and then <hi>Cletus,</hi> were Biſhops
of <hi>Rome</hi> during the <hi>Life of Peter:</hi> whereby it is evident, that
<hi>Peter</hi> was never properly <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> but was called <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Rome</hi> by thoſe Fathers, becauſe he founded the Church
of <hi>Rome joyntly with Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, your Lordſhips will find it proved, albeit
many of the Ancients unanimouſly affirmed, <hi>that</hi> Peter <hi>was at</hi>
Rome, <hi>and founded the Church of</hi> Rome; yet, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
or elſe the Scripture affirms falſly; ſince it ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Scripture, that <hi>Peter</hi> was elſewhere in that time, in which
they affirm he was at <hi>Rome:</hi> yea, it ſhall be proved by unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
reaſons from Scripture, that <hi>Peter</hi> was never at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
that all thoſe Fathers who believe he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> were deceived
by the teſtimony of one <hi>Papias,</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Euſebius to be a
man of no ſpirit, the Author of many fabulous Traditions,
and of the hereſie of the Millenarii;</hi> That is, of thoſe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
<hi>that Chriſt before the laſt day, ſhall reign a thouſand
years with his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place, your Lordſhips will find, that the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome,</hi> before the dayes of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> were poor, perſecuted, pious
Martyrs; only two condemned by the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Biſhops of</hi> Africa <hi>and</hi> Spain, <hi>anno 250. or thereabouts</hi> Some
<pb facs="tcp:64826:8"/>
Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pretends ſeveral monuments of
Antiquity, to prove the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome in that
interval:</hi> but they ſhall be proved forged, not only by <hi>unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
reaſons,</hi> but alſo by the confeſsions of the moſt learned
Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yea of Popes themſelves, ſuch
as <hi>Aeneas Silvius,</hi> or <hi>Pius</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>In th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fourth place, your Lordſhips will find the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome</hi> made rich, by the liberality of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperor
and others; which occaſioned <hi>pride and luxury,</hi> the Parents of
<hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fifth place, your Lordſhips will find the conception of this
Monſter, growing as an <hi>Embrio</hi> by degrees in his Mothers belly;
the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In which interval, as the riches of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> increaſed,
ſo pride and corruptions of life grew up with them, and alſo ſome
corruption in Doctrine: againſt which, not only <hi>Cyprian, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus,
Sulpitius, Severus, Nezianzenus, Baſilius Magnus,</hi>
and other Chriſtian Fathers exclaimed, but alſo <hi>Ammianus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus,</hi>
in the opinion of <hi>Barron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> a Pagan. In that interval,
<hi>Damaſus</hi> mounted to the Chair of <hi>Rome</hi> by blood; of which,
the ſaid <hi>Amm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anus Marcellinus</hi> ſpeaking, after he had related the
murthers that were committed, he concludes, <hi>It was not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
they aimed at the Chair of</hi> Rome <hi>by ſuch practices, ſince
having obtained it, they were enriched by the Gifts of Matrons
and other wayes, equalling any King in their port of Table,
Cloaths, Houſhold-ſtuff, Attendance and Coatches, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots.</hi>
In that interval alſo, <hi>Vigilius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (as is
related by <hi>Liberatus,</hi> and confeſſed by <hi>Barronius</hi>) obtained the
Chair of <hi>Rome</hi> by promiſing to the Empreſs <hi>Theodora,</hi> to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> to eſtabliſh the <hi>Eutichian</hi> hereſie
in the Church (which he endeavoured to do, as appears by his
Letters, when he was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> written to ſeveral Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
<pb facs="tcp:64826:8"/>
in which he approved that hereſie) And likewayes, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
Gold to <hi>Beleſarius,</hi> General to the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi>
in <hi>Italy:</hi> By which practices of <hi>Vigilius, Silverius,</hi> a pious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (to make way for the ſaid <hi>Vigilius</hi>) was
baniſhed and murthered; and yet the ſaid <hi>Vigilius</hi> was a great
ingeminator of <hi>tu es Petrus,</hi> and of <hi>the infallibility of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of</hi> Rome. And yet <hi>Barronius</hi> is not aſhamed, againſt all
the Writers of that time, to praiſe this Monſter as a Saint; and
yet (which is admirable) he confeſſeth the way of his entry to
the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> viz. <hi>by diſplacing a pious Biſhop, he
obtained the Chair by Simonie, and promiſing to abrogat the
Council o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Chalcedon, <hi>and to eſtabliſh the</hi> Eutichian <hi>hereſie.</hi>
And this much of the conception of this Monſter.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth place, ye have his birth under <hi>Phocas,</hi> who by an
Edict, chriſtened him <hi>univerſal Biſhop:</hi> In which, three things
are obſervable, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The God-father; 2. The God-bairn Gift;
3. The reaſons wherefore it was given <hi>Phocas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The God-father was the Emperour <hi>Phocas,</hi> deſcribed by all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
to be a Monſter for a man; who being a Centurion, or Captain
of a Foot-company, raiſed a mutiny in the Army againſt the good
Emperour <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and obtained the Empire himſelf by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
his Maſter, his Empreſs, his Children and his Friends,
noted by Hiſtorians to have been a perfidious, perjured, luxurious,
cruel Monſter: and yet, he was the firſt Emperour who made the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome oecumenick</hi> or <hi>univerſal Biſhop.</hi> And this
much of the God-father of that Monſter, which is all the <hi>Jus
Divinum</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have for their Monarchy in the
Church.</p>
            <p>The next thing obſervable, is the <hi>God-bairn gift,</hi> or the
title <hi>of Univerſal Biſhop, conferred</hi> by <hi>Phocas</hi> upon <hi>Bonefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
third Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the beginning of the ſeventh
Age, or about <hi>anno,</hi> 604. If your Lordſhips aſk what ſort of
Title and Office it is? <hi>Gregorius Magnus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64826:9"/>
(who died not two years before <hi>Bonifacius</hi> 3d was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
who was firſt made univerſal Biſhop by <hi>Phocas</hi>) And <hi>Pelagius</hi>
ſecond Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (to hom immediatly <hi>Gregorius Magnus</hi>
ſucceeded) will inform your Lordſhips, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Title, and
Office of univerſal Biſhop, were <hi>new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not heard of before that
time, Scelerate, Prophane, Sacrilegious, Blaſphemous
againſt the Mandates of Chriſt, Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles,
Canons and Liberties of the Church. Who ever took upon
him, that Office or Title, He contaminated thoſe very
times in which he lived, was that Man of Sin, ſitting in the
Temple of God, exalting himſelf above all that are called
God;</hi> (So <hi>Pelagius,</hi> in an Epiſtle to a Council at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople)
that he was like the Devil, exalting himſelf above
the other Angels, and equalling himſelf to God;</hi> (So <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius</hi>)
which expreſſions, of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Gregorius,</hi> and
many others, (too prolix to be inſerted here) are found word for
word in their Epiſtles: Thoſe Teſtimonies at length, ye will
find in the ſecond Book of the ſecond Part, of this following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
            <p>The third thing obſerveable by your Lordſhips is, the reaſons
wherefore the Emperour <hi>Phocas</hi> beſtowed that Title of <hi>oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Biſhop</hi> upon <hi>Bonifacius</hi> third? They are mentioned by
<hi>Barronius, ad annum,</hi> 604. and others alſo, as <hi>Sabellicus</hi> and
<hi>Platina,</hi> there is not one word of <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> or of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Romes</hi> ſucceſſion to <hi>Peter</hi> amongſt them all; They were
all civil reſpects; As firſt, becauſe the Emperour had his
Title from <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſince <hi>Rome</hi> was the old Imperial Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
It was reaſon that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over all Biſhops. This is the onely reaſon, mentioned
in the Edict of <hi>Phocas;</hi> Others add there reaſons, One of which
is this; <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, murthered by <hi>Phocas,</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
the title of <hi>univerſal Biſhop</hi> upon <hi>John,</hi> called <hi>Jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:64826:9"/>
and <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> thunder both againſt the
Title, and the Function, as we now mentioned, but to no
purpoſe: <hi>John</hi> ſtill poſſeſſeth both the Title and the Office. In

which <hi>Cyriacus,</hi> protected the Empreſs, and Children of <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius,</hi>

his Maſter <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and all his race, domineered with ſuch
tyrrany, that he was abhorred of all: fearing a revolt in the Weſt,
to curry favour with <hi>Bonifacius</hi> third Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (whoſe
authority was very great in it) he beſtowed the title of <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Biſhop</hi> upon him, that by his moyen, he might be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Empyre, and acknowledged by the Romans: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
reaſon related by ſome is, that the ſaid <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> either
gave, or did promiſe to give, to <hi>Phocas,</hi> a hudge maſs of Money,
and ſo bought the Office from him. However, whatever were the
reaſons which moved <hi>Phocas,</hi> it is moſt certain, that the Edict,
or Gift of <hi>Phocas</hi> is the oldeſt Evident and Charter that the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> can produce, to inſtruct his Monarchy in the
Church; which will more clearly appear, by what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, your Lordſhips will find, that new born Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Chriſtned <hi>univerſal Biſhop,</hi> by the Edict of <hi>Phocas;</hi>
ſhunned every where, in the Eaſt, in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> in
<hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> yea in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf, under the walls
of <hi>Rome,</hi> the whole Church, refuſing to obey the Edict of
<hi>Phocas,</hi> or to acknowledge the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> univerſal Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop:
One only Paraſite excepted, the Biſhop of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> who
ſaluted him by that name, out of envy to the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople:</hi>
So that in the end, (as it was recorded by ſome) the
<pb facs="tcp:64826:10"/>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for very ſhame, gave over that Title of <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Biſhop.</hi> The poſterior Emperoures alſo recalled that Edict
of <hi>Phocas,</hi> as appears by the 36th. Canon of the ſixth general
Council, called <hi>Trullanum,</hi> convocated by <hi>Pogonatus,</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> anno, 680. <hi>By</hi> which 36th. Canon of
the ſaid Council, was confirmed the 28th. Canon of the Council
of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> celebrated <hi>anno, 450. By</hi> which, the Biſhop
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was made equal to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in
Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>In the Eighth place, your Lordſhips will find, in the decay of the
Grecian Empyre (by the Inundations of barbarous Nations, all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Empyre, and each of them enemies to one another)
that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> in theſe vicisſitudes, ſided ever with the
Conquerour, being alſo courted by them, to countenance them in
the eſtabliſhment of their new and unſettled conqueſts:
<hi>By</hi> which practices, that <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Monſter, (almoſt
blaſted in the Budd, and ſtrangled in the Craddle) revived again,
not only re-aſſuming the Title of <hi>univerſal Biſhop,</hi> beſtowed on
him by <hi>Phocas;</hi> But alſo, ſoaring higher, taking upon
him to excomunicate the Grecian Emperour, to ſtir up the
Longobards, to bereave him of his poſſeſſions in <hi>Italy,</hi> To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Exharchat of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> To bereave him of the Dutchy
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> got to his own ſhare: And when the
Longobards demanded Tribute of him, for the ſaid Dutchy of
<hi>Rome,</hi> (which the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were acuſtomed to pay to
the Grecian Emperours) Then he called in the <hi>French,</hi> by whoſe
means he deſtroyed the Kingdom of the Longobards; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
the <hi>French</hi> Services, he made <hi>Pipin</hi> their General, King
of <hi>France,</hi> (ſhutting up the righteous King in a Monaſtery) And
alſo, in contempt of the Grecian Emperour, he made <hi>Carolus
Magnus,</hi> (Son of the ſaid <hi>Pipin</hi>) Emperour of the Weſt: Since
which time, the Empyre of the West has been divided from that
of the Eaſt, until this day: That is, ſince the latter end, of
the Eighth Age or Century.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64826:10"/>
In the ninth place, your Lordſhips will find a ſtrange Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy:
The Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> brag much of the
ſubmiſſive obedience of <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> to the power of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> which in effect he ſeemed to do at firſt, untill
he obtained his ends: but having accompliſhed his intentions,
he made it appear to poſterity, that both the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
juriſdiction of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>was a Sword in a mad
mans hand:</hi> he curbed him ſo, both in <hi>ſpirituals</hi> and <hi>temporals,</hi>
that he left him no more, but the bare Title of <hi>univerſal Biſhop,</hi>
but as to the power of it, he made him a meer cypher, as appears
by what follows. The Hiſtory is very pleaſant, but much depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Popiſh Authors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch as <hi>Barronius</hi> and others: but if
your Lordſhips will believe thoſe Hiſtorians, (who liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in the time
of <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> or the times next following, who queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

Writer, known to be abominable depravers of Antiquity by
unanſwerable Arguments, as ſhall be proved in the following
Treatiſe) The ſtory is this, and two-fold; In the firſt is related,
what little reſpect <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> had to the <hi>ſpiritual authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is this:</p>
            <p>The quarrel of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the Grecian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was for <hi>Images,</hi> or <hi>Image-worſhip:</hi>
Two Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople, Leo, Iſaurus</hi> and <hi>Coprony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
his ſon, had procured <hi>Image-worſhip</hi> to be declared <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
in the ſeventh general Council of <hi>Conſtantinople, anno,</hi> 760,
conſiſting of 338 Biſhops.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stephanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> procures of <hi>Irene</hi> (Daughter-in-law
to <hi>Copronymus,</hi> Widow of <hi>Leo</hi> 4. his Son, and Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regent
of the Eaſtern Empire, during the minority of her Son
<hi>Conſtantinus</hi> 7th.) the ſecond Council of <hi>Neice,</hi> which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
declared the 7th, general Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and eſtabliſhed <hi>Image-worſhip;</hi> which Decree of the ſecond
Council of <hi>Neice,</hi> was confirmed and renewed by ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
<pb facs="tcp:64826:11"/>
Councils in <hi>Italy,</hi> under ſeveral Biſhops of <hi>Rome.
Carolus Magnus</hi> calls a Council at <hi>Franckford, anno,</hi> 794. in
which were preſent moſt of the Biſhops of the Weſt, in number 300.
at which Council were alſo preſent the Legats of <hi>Hadrianus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſolicite the Council to eſtabliſh <hi>Image-worſhip,</hi>
to condemn <hi>the 7th. general Council of</hi> Conſtantinople,
<hi>as heretical;</hi> to confirm <hi>the 2d. Council of</hi> Neice <hi>as Orthodox,</hi>
and likewayes <hi>thoſe Provincial Councils of</hi> Italy, <hi>which had
eſtabliſhed Image-worſhip.</hi> The Council of <hi>Franckford</hi> (in
which <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> preſided) was ſo far from obeying the
commands of <hi>Hadrianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that on the contrary
it confirmed <hi>the 7th. general Council of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi>
condemned <hi>the 2d. Council of</hi> Neice, <hi>three or four
Provincial Councils in</hi> Italy, <hi>and three or four Biſhops of</hi> Rome
(and amongſt them, <hi>Hadrianus primus</hi> himſelf) <hi>as impious,
heretical Idolaters, becauſe they eſtabliſhed Image-worſhip.</hi>
And after the Council was diſſolved, a Book was written at the
command of <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> (which Book is yet preſerved in
ſeveral Bibliothecks) in which at length was declared, by what
ſophiſtry, perverting of Scripture, <hi>Image-worſhip</hi> was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by the ſaid 2d. Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and thoſe other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Councils of <hi>Italy.</hi> Here your Lordſhips may obſerve, what
regard <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> had to the ſpiritual Authority of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who exauctorated the Emperors of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
for procuring <hi>Image-worſhip</hi> to be declared <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and
renting from them the Empire of the Weſt, conferred it upon the
ſaid <hi>Carolus Magnus:</hi> and yet, the ſaid <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> in a
Council at <hi>Franckford,</hi> procures the ſaid Emperor in the Eaſt to be
declared <hi>Orthodox,</hi> in aboliſhing <hi>Image worſhip,</hi> and condemns
thoſe very Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as hereticks, who had depoſed the
Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for that reaſon; and who, for
that reaſon, had given unto himſelf the Empyre of the Weſt:
whereby it appears, that although he ſeemed plyable to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb facs="tcp:64826:11"/>
of <hi>Romes</hi> juriſdiction, to obtain his own ends, yet having
obtained them, he cared not much for him.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> acknowledged not the infallibility of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſpirituals, he regarded his temporal juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
far leſs. We told before, that the reaſon wherefore the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> called in the French againſt the Lombards, was,
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cauſe they demanded Tribute of him, for the Territories about
<hi>Rome;</hi> their Title was <hi>conqueſt,</hi> they had conquered theſe Lands
from the Grecian Emperors: And ſince the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was
ever accuſtomed to pay Tribute for thoſe Lands unto the Grecian
Emperor, it was reaſonable, that themſelves having conquered the
Lands, ſhould alſo have the Tribute. Whereupon the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> calls in the French to <hi>Italy,</hi> to aſſiſt him againſt the Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards:
And firſt, <hi>Carolus Martellus</hi> leads an Army into <hi>Italy,</hi>
in favour of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> next, his Son <hi>Pipin</hi> (whom
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> made King of <hi>France</hi>) Laſtly, <hi>Carolus
Magnus</hi> the Son of <hi>Pipin,</hi> and Emperour of the Weſt, utterly
eradicats the Kingdom of the Lombards: and when he had done,
in a Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> it is decreed firſt, <hi>That no Biſhop</hi> (not the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf) <hi>ſhould be inſtalled without inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the Emperor by Staff and Ring,</hi> and likewayes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<hi>more majorum,</hi> which (as <hi>Salvianus</hi> interprets) was,
<hi>kiſſing of the Emperors foot. 2. That the Emperor and</hi> his
Succeſſors, ſhould have the preſentation of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and his Succeſſors; that is, ſhould have the <hi>nomination</hi> and
<hi>election</hi> of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> 3. The Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
we ſaid, called in the French againſt the Lombards, becauſe the
ſaid Lombards required Tribute of him for the <hi>Roman Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories:
Carolus Magnus</hi> having deſtroyed the Lombards, makes
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> pay the ſame Tribute, pretending the ſame
reaſons which the Lombards did, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome</hi> were accuſtomed to pay that Tribute to the Grecian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
to whom he had ſucceeded in the Dominion of the Weſt.
<pb facs="tcp:64826:12"/>
And thus it appears, what little regard <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> had to
the authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> either ſpiritual or temporal?
The firſt appears, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had exauctorated the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
Emperors, for being enemies to <hi>Image-worſhip;</hi> and for that
reaſon, gave to <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> the Empyre of the Weſt, (at leaſt
as much as in him lay) <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> takes the Empire, but
in the mean time, in the Council of <hi>Franckford,</hi> he procures thoſe
very Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had beſtowed upon himſelf the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
to be declared Idolaters and Hereticks, for eſtabliſhing <hi>Image-worſhip;</hi>
and conſequently, for depoſing the Grecian Emperors,
becauſe they were againſt Images, and for giving to himſelf their
Empire in the Weſt for that reaſon. The ſecond appears thus, the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> calls in the French againſt the Lombards, becauſe
they demanded Tribute of him, for the Territories about <hi>Rome:
Carolus Magnus</hi> deſtroyes the Lombards, and when he had done,
makes the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> pay the ſame Tribute to himſelf and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Succeſſors; and not ſo content, ordains they ſhould do him homage,
<hi>more majorum;</hi> That is (according to <hi>Salvianus) by kiſſing of
of his foot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly, your Lordſhips will find this Monſter ſtill ſo bridled, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the decay of the poſterity of <hi>Carolus Magnus;</hi> and then the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
was tranſlated to the Germans, the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>
to the Family of <hi>Hugh Capet. Otho primus</hi> Emperour, ſon of
<hi>Henricus Auceps,</hi> the firſt German Emperour, renewed that
power of the Emperour, his nomination and election of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of</hi> Rome, which the former Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had taken
from the Emperours, during the decay and ſlouth of the poſterity
of <hi>Carolus Magnus:</hi> but a little after that, the myſtery of
Iniquity working, foretold by <hi>Paul, 2 Theſſ.</hi> 2. the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome,</hi> by the counſel of one <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> afterwards Pope
<hi>Gregory</hi> ſeventh, ordained the Colledge of Cardinals for election
of the Pope; which manner of election was utterly unknown
to the Ancients, the firſt Pope who ordained this Colledge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
<pb facs="tcp:64826:12"/>
was <hi>Nicolaus</hi> 2d. who lived <hi>anno,</hi> 1060. which manner
of Election continueth unto this day.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> becoming afterwards Pope, took upon
him to depoſe Emperors: <hi>Anno,</hi> 1074. he depoſed <hi>Henry</hi> 4th.
Emperour, and gave the Empire to <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> becauſe <hi>Henry</hi>
would not renunce the inveſtiture of Biſhops; this <hi>Hildebrand</hi>
raiſed many broils and troubles, and was believed by many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (who lived about that time)
<hi>to be Antichriſt;</hi> his Succeſſors eſpecially, after the times of
the Jeſuits, ſtill augmented that Doctrine, <hi>of depoſing Kings by
the Pope:</hi> and it is now defended, not only in Books printed by
the Popes Authority, and by all the Canoniſts, but alſo aſſumed by
Popes unto themſelves in their Bulls, as appears by thoſe Bulls of
<hi>Gregory</hi> 7th. againſt <hi>Henry</hi> 4th. Emperor; of <hi>Alexander</hi> 3d.
againſt <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperor; of <hi>Boniface</hi> 8th. againſt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
King of <hi>France;</hi> of <hi>Julius</hi> ſecond againſt <hi>Lewis</hi> twelfth
King of <hi>France,</hi> and againſt the King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi>
third againſt <hi>Henry</hi> 8th. King of <hi>England;</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> 4th.
againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> of <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5th. againſt <hi>Henry</hi> 3d.
and 4th. Kings of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Phocas</hi> by Edict, made <hi>Bonifacius</hi> 3d. Biſhop of <hi>Rome,
univerſal Biſhop;</hi> the thing he gave him was little better then
a bare Title. We have ſhewed two ſteps, by which the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome</hi> advanced; the firſt is, his freeing himſelf from the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Emperor; the ſecond, his aſſuming to himſelf <hi>power
of depoſing Kings and Emperors:</hi> the third ſtep after <hi>Phocas,</hi>
was aſſuming to himſelf <hi>authority of convocating General
Councils, of preſiding in them, of confirming and infirming
them.</hi> We do not read, that any Pope aſſumed that power to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the firſt nine hundered years after Chriſt: It is evident,
by Hiſtory, that during the time of the firſt eight general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had no ſuch power, ſince it appears,
they were all convocated by the Emperor, that others beſide the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> preſided in many of them, and the Emperor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb facs="tcp:64826:13"/>
them all. What Pope firſt aſsumed to himſelf that power,
we find not expreſly before the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> 3d. in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Lateran,</hi> anno, 1210. ſince which time, the ſucceeding
Popes conſtantly took upon them to convocat general Councils,
to preſide in them, and to confirm them.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſtep of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> after <hi>Phocas,</hi> is
his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Infallibity;</hi> which was firſt conferred upon him, by the
Council of <hi>Florence, anno,</hi> 1439. and afterward confirmed and
taught by the Jeſuites, and Canoniſts, it being held as ane ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope <hi>in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra,
or teaching the whole Church, cannot err:</hi> yea,
ſome of them maintain, (as <hi>Albertus Pighius</hi> and others) that
the Pope cannot be an heretick, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls a pious
opinion: but your Lordſhips will find it proved, part third,
<hi>lib.</hi> 2. that innumerable Popes, have not only been hereticks,
and ſo declared by other Popes, and general Councils, but alſo,
that they have taught hereſie, and have been condemned by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils, <hi>for teaching hereſie,</hi> as Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by three <hi>ſucceſſive general Councils,</hi> the ſixth, ſeventh,
and eight, and of late Pope <hi>Engenius</hi> by the Councills of <hi>Baſill:</hi>
By whence it appears, that this Doctrine of the Popes <hi>infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
is not only <hi>hereſie,</hi> but <hi>madneſs,</hi> fighting againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe, reaſon, and the light of all Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Any would think, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> could mount no
higher, ſince already, <hi>he is Monarch of the whole World,
both in Sprituals and Temporals.</hi> We have ſeen him hitherto, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him power of depoſing Kings, and Emperours, of
transferring Kingdomes at his pleaſure, of coyning Articles of
Faith (under the notion of infallibility) oblieging the whole
Church: yet in the laſt place, your Lordſhips will find him in
the fourth part of this Diſput, ſitting in the temple of God,
adorned with all the marks of Antichriſt, intending a <hi>gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomachy,</hi>
as if the intended to pull God out of the Heavens, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:64826:13"/>
upon him, not only to equal his decretal Epiſtles to holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but alſo to prefer them unto it; in ſeveral of them, decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
againſt the Law of God, openly avowing, he has power ſo
to do; injoyning it, to the whole Church to be believed, under
pain of hereſie, that he hath ſuch power. Your Lordſhips will
find, that in the Canon Law, he is called <hi>Dominus Deus noſter
Papa, our Lord God the Pope:</hi> that he takes upon him, not
only to pardon ſins for money, both by-paſt, and to come, but
alſo for a peice of money, to ſuffer the Clergy to wallow in whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
albeit againſt all pure Antiquity, he expreſly inhibits
them marriage. Your Lordſhips will find it proved, that in the
ſaid Canon Law, he affirms himſelf, by reaſon of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesſion
to <hi>Peter,</hi> to be aſſumed, to the ſociety of the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
Trinity; that for money, he will command the Angels to
take ſouls out of purgatory, and place them ſtraight in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe:
And in a word, your Lordſhips will find him, <hi>that man
of ſin deſcribed by the Apoſtle, ſitting in the Temple of
God, exalting himſelf above all that are called God, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf God, teaching the doctrine of devils, forbidding
meats, forbidding marriage, making the Kings of the earth
drunk with his abominations, corrupting all the Articles of
the Chriſtian Faith, taking from them, adding to them at
his pleaſure:</hi> and as he groweth in power, depravation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
encreaſeth with it, following the increments of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as the motion of the Sea, depends upon the Moon.</p>
            <p>In purer Antiquity, when there was no evidence of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> at all, there was no corruption
in Doctrine, Religion was unſpotted: but when the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> enriched by the liberality of the Emperours, became
proud, and aimed to uſurp over the Church, corruption in Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
encreaſed apace, with their increments of power. Conſult
Hiſtory, and your Lordſhips will find, at every ſtep of the Popes
advancement in power, a depravation in Doctrine accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:64826:14"/>
it: your Lordſhips will likewayes find it proved, part
fourth, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. that the Doctrine of the modern Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> is nothing elſe <hi>but a maſſe of depravations, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
hereſies, brought in by Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in authority, the Doctrine of the firſt ſix Centuries
being quite extinct.</hi> Notwithſtanding all the braggings of our
adverſaries, <hi>of their Antiquity,</hi> your Lordſhips will find, <hi>in
the firſt ſix hundred years after Chriſt, that the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
now profeſſed by the modern Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unknown, and had not a beeing;</hi> or if any of their
modern Tenets were mentioned by the Writers in thoſe times, it
was with deteſtation, <hi>under the notion of Hereſie,</hi> and oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the whole Church. If your Lordſhips think this incredible,
ye will find it proved, <hi>part 4. lib.</hi> 2. Of this treatiſe, by an
<hi>induction</hi> of all thoſe Tenets, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hold
contrary to the Doctrine of the reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> In the laſt place, you will find it
proved, by what practices the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> maintains himſelf
in that prodigious greatneſs, and his Doctrine? None can but
admire how he hath been ſo long undiſcovered? and how ſo many
learned and pious men, brave ſpirits, can be ſo bewitched yet, as to
believe, <hi>that communion with him, is neceſſary unto ſalvation;
and that all who acknowledge not his power and Doctrine,
ought to be condemned as Hereticks.</hi> But their admiration
may ceaſe, ſince the Spirit of God affirms, <hi>that the Kings of the
earth ſhall be drunk with his abominations;</hi> that is, ſhall be
void of all ſpiritual underſtanding, that the glory of God may be
manifeſted in his imperveſtigable wayes, till at laſt, that <hi>wicked
one</hi> be conſumed <hi>by the breath of his mouth,</hi> that is, by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
preaching of the Goſpel. The cup of iniquity of that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
was not yet full, untill he began ſo far to forget himſelf, as
to prefer himſelf to God, and make publick ſale of forgiveneſs
of ſins for money; that is, by giving pardons unto men, not only
<pb facs="tcp:64826:14"/>
for ſins by-paſt, but alſo to be committed afterwards, giving to this
Courtier, the money obtained for the pardon of ſins obtained in
one Countrey, to that of another. It is reported of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the ſixth, that when it was told him, that his Son <hi>Caeſar Burgia</hi>
had loſt a hudge ſum of money at Dice; he anſwered, that his
Son had loſt nothing but <hi>the ſins of the Germans;</hi> that is, the
money which he had got for the ſale of pardons in that Nation.
When his impiety came to ſuch a height, he was at laſt diſcovered
by <hi>Luther,</hi> a poor <hi>Frier;</hi> ſince which time, they have left no ſort
of cruelty and impoſtures unattempted, to preſerve their Power
and their Doctrine.</p>
            <p>And firſt for their cruelty towards thoſe who oppoſed them,
death without torture was thought a <hi>clemency;</hi> the ordinar pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of ſuch was, <hi>burning alive;</hi> and if they were ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
that it could not be conveniently done, they trained them
into ſnares, by perfidious Treaties, cutting their throats when they
were aſleep, without regard to the publick Faith given them; as
appears by the horrible maſſacre at <hi>Paris,</hi> and other places of
<hi>France:</hi> and albeit popiſh Writers, in thoſe times, deteſted that
perfidious cruelty; yet the Pope himſelf, who was the Author, and
contriver of it, made Proceſſions of joy, and Bone-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ires at <hi>Rome,</hi>
for the ſucceſs of it.</p>
            <p>As for their impoſtures, by which they maintain their Power
and Doctrine, they are ſo many, that they are ſcarce nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
the main are <hi>preferring the corrupt Latine verſion of
the Scripture, to the Greek and Hebrew Fountains, held
authentick by the Primitive Church,</hi> and the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. Secondly, <hi>by adding Books to the Canon of
the Scripture, againſt all the current of Antiquity,</hi> to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
ſome of their idolatrous Tenets. 3. They make the Pope
<hi>the infallible Interpreter of Scripture,</hi> albeit perhaps he had
never read one ſyllable in it, or at leaſt underſtood nothing in it;
as appears of late, by that paſſage of <hi>Innocent</hi> 10th. (related by
<pb facs="tcp:64826:15"/>
               <hi>Sanct Amour,</hi> in his Journal) who being preſſed to determine
a Controverſie in Religion, between the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts,</hi>
anſwered, <hi>he was an old man, and had never ſtudied Divinity,
neither did it belong to his profeſſion.</hi> 4. They have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
all the Writings of the Ancients, adding to them, taking
from them at their pleaſure; as appears by the Edition of the
Fathers, ſet forth by <hi>Manutius</hi> at the Popes command, againſt all
the Manuſcript Copies, and old printed Copies, before <hi>anno,</hi> 1564.
neither are they aſhamed of it, avowing it in their <hi>indices expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorii:</hi>
and not content with corrupting of Antiquity, they alſo
forge, not only particular teſtimonies of Fathers, but alſo whole
Treatices. <hi>Aeneas Silvius,</hi> who was afterwards Pope himſelf,
under the name of <hi>Pius</hi> 2d. confeſſed ingenuouſly, <hi>that no regard
was held to the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>before the
Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>or anno,</hi> 325. and yet they produce ſix and
thirty decretal Epiſtles of Popes, as ſo many Knights of the Poſt,
to bear falſe witneſs for it in that interval, acknowledged to
be forged, by <hi>Cuſanus, Contius,</hi> and other great Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither are they much regarded by
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Barronius</hi> themſelves. Again, the moſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Doctors of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> and their greateſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries
confeſs, that nothing can be gathered from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice,</hi> for the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> Yea,
all Antiquity acknowledged only twenty Canons of the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice:</hi> Yet the Jeſuits of late, have found out two <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick
Editions,</hi> in which, fifty Canons are added to thoſe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
ſo palpably forged, that he is blind, who doth not ſee it.
Yea, they are acknowledged for ſuch, by the moſt learned men
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The main ſcope of thoſe forged Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
is to prove ſeveral principal Tenets, of the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
eſpecially the Popes Supremacy, That they are forged,
ſhall be proved, <hi>part 2. lib.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> maintain their authority, and
<pb facs="tcp:64826:15"/>
Doctrine, by <hi>falſe miracles, Saints and Revelations;</hi> but mainly
by thoſe two damned cheats, <hi>implicit faith</hi> and <hi>infallibility;</hi>
that is, they make their diſciples believe that all is Goſpel, <hi>what
the Pope affirmeth</hi> in Cathedra, <hi>and that he cannot erre teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>But I anſwer, as it were ill manners in me to tax thoſe brave

So I am confident, none will blame me with any ſhew of reaſon,
except firſt he conſider what I ſay. It is true indeed, many have
written before me, but it is as true, that ſome of them have written
too <hi>dogmatically,</hi> ſome too <hi>hiſtorically;</hi> both which wayes are

He was a brave man, and a great Ornament to the <hi>Proteſtant
Religion;</hi> but he hath many <hi>conciſe thetorications,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
which, much knowledge of Antiquity is requiſite; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
theſe paſſages of his are ſo many <hi>aenigmata</hi> to beginners
of the ſtudy of Antiquity, whoſe utility I principally aim at in
this Work, that ſailing about the doors in this little Barge, they
may learn by degrees to ſail in the great Ships of others, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the immenſe Ocean of Antiquity. The method I uſe, is this
following; if any in reaſon ſhall not think it fit, after reaſonable
inſtruction of my error, I ſhall make a recantation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> The whole Treatiſe is taken up in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theſe <hi>three Queſtions;</hi> the firſt is, <hi>If</hi> Peter <hi>was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by our Saviour Monarch of the Church, or viſible Head
of the Church under Himſelf?</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>If at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Chriſt, he took the charge of the Biſhoprick of</hi>
Rome? The third is. <hi>If by divine Inſtitution, the Biſhop of</hi>
Rome <hi>ſucceeded to</hi> Peter <hi>in the Monarchy of the Church?</hi>
And whereas our adverſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> endeavour
to prove the <hi>affirmatives</hi> of theſe three queſtions by Antiquity,
that is, <hi>teſtimonies of Councils and Fathers;</hi> my ſcope is, <hi>to
diſprove the ſaid three affirmatives in the ſame manner,</hi> and to
prove, that all what they pretend from Antiquity, is either <hi>wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
perverted, mutilated, falſly tranſlated from the Originals,
or forged down-right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Treatiſe is divided in four Parts; the firſt Part is
entituled, <hi>of Biſhops,</hi> and contains the Hierarchy of the Church,
unto the death of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which was after the middle of the
third Age: In which interval, I endeavour to prove, there was
no ordinar Office in the Church, <hi>above that of a Biſhop;</hi> and
that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was in no more Authority then any other
Biſhop albeit he was firſt Biſhop <hi>in dignity,</hi> becauſe <hi>Biſhop of the
old Imperial City.</hi> This firſt part is divided in two Books, in
the firſt is diſputed <hi>the Monarchy of</hi> Peter, by his <hi>inſtitution,
<pb facs="tcp:64826:16"/>
prerogatives</hi> and <hi>carriage,</hi> and <hi>teſtimonies of Fathers,</hi> unto
<hi>cap.</hi> 22. In the reſt of that Book is diſputed, <hi>if ever</hi> Peter <hi>was
at</hi> Rome? and if he were, <hi>if he was Biſhop of</hi> Rome?</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Book, is diſputed, if the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was
adcnowledged, as ſucceſſor to <hi>Peter</hi> in the Monarchy of the
Church, before the death of <hi>Cyprian?</hi> In which Book, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
moſt upon theſe following particulars; Firſt, I relate the
opinion of <hi>Aerius</hi> and his followers, concerning the Original
Progreſſe, and univerſal eſtabliſhment of Epiſcopacy; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a Biſhop differs from a Preſbyter? and for what reaſons Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
was brought into the Church? 2. I prove by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of <hi>Ignatius, Dionyſius,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelf, that
there was no Office in the Church, in that interval, above that
of a <hi>Biſhop.</hi> 3. I anſwer ſeveral teſtimonies, pretended by
thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to prove the Popes Supremacy in
that interval, from <hi>Actions of Popes, Appellations to them,</hi>
and from teſtimonies of Greek and Latine Fathers. 4. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
ſeveral Forgeries and Corruptions of the Fathers, made
uſe of by ſome <hi>Roman Doctors,</hi> to prove the Supremacy of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> in that Interval.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Part is intituled, <hi>of Arch-biſhops;</hi> in which
I diſput the Hierarchy of the Church, from the death of <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
unto the beginning of the <hi>ſeventh Century,</hi> or to <hi>anno,</hi>
604. at which time, the Emperor <hi>Phocas</hi> took the title of
<hi>univerſal Biſhop</hi> from <hi>Cyriacus,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
and beſtowed it upon <hi>Bonifacius</hi> third, Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi>
which is an interval of 344. years. It is divided in two
Books, the firſt, intitulated, <hi>of Metrapolitans;</hi> In which I
diſput, the Hierarchy of the Church, from <hi>Cyprian, anno,</hi>
260. unto the Council of <hi>Chalcedon, anno,</hi> 453. all which
time, no Office was in the Church, above that of a <hi>Metrapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:</hi>
inſiſting moſt upon theſe following particulars, firſt, of
the original, progreſſe, and univerſal eſtabliſhment of <hi>Metrapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64826:17"/>
wherein a <hi>Metrapolitan</hi> differ from another Biſhop?
For what reaſon, Metrapolians were brought into the Church?
What place the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had, amongſt Metrapolitans?
where I prove, by unanſwerable teſtimonies of Antiquity, that
other Metrapolitans were of <hi>alike Juriſdiction with him,</hi> and
that he was only, <hi>firſt Metrapolitan in dignity,</hi> for the ſame
reaſon that he was <hi>firſt Biſhop</hi> in the interval of <hi>Biſhops, viz.</hi>
becauſe he was Biſhop in the Chief Imperial City. 2. Trace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the lives of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that interval, I
diſput <hi>pro,</hi> and <hi>contra,</hi> the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
in it, by their actions, uſurpations, add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſes made to them,
and Acts of general, and particular Councils, celebrated in
each of their times. 3. I examine the opinions of Greek and
Latine Fathers, who lived in that interval, concerning the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in it. 4. I examine ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
forgeries, pretended by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to
prove the Pops ſupremacy in that interval.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Book is entituled, <hi>of Patriarchs,</hi> containing
the Hierarchy of the Church, from the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,
anno,</hi> 453. to <hi>Phocas</hi> and <hi>Bonifacius, anno,</hi> 604. In which
Interval, <hi>Patriarchs</hi> obtained the chief place of the <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;</hi>
inſiſting alſo upon thoſe five particulars; 1. Of the
original, progreſſe, and univerſal eſtabliſhment of Patriarchs,
wherein a Patriarch differs from a Metrapolitan? for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
Patriarchs were broug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had amongſt Patriarchs? <hi>viz.</hi> all <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
were alike to him in <hi>Juriſdiction:</hi> Yet he was the <hi>firſt Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi>
in dignity, for the ſame reaſon that he was firſt Biſhop in
the Interval of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and firſt <hi>Metrapolitan</hi> in the Interval
of <hi>Metrapolitans,</hi> that is for civil reſpects (and not by <hi>reaſon
of ſucceſſion to Peter in the Monarchy of the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Rome</hi> was the old imperial City, of which he was <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch.</hi>
2. Traceing the lives of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> of that
<pb facs="tcp:64826:17"/>
interval, I diſput their Supremacy from their Actions, Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations,
Addreſſes made to them, from general and particular
Councils, celebrated in their time. 3. I examine the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Greek and Latine Fathers, who lived in that Interval,
concerning the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in it. 4. I
examine thoſe Forgeries, pretended by thoſe of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to prove the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in that
Interval. 5. I minut that notable controverſie, betwixt the
Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>

                  </gap>iding in them, of confirming and infirming them,</hi> 3. Power
in temporals, 4. In fallibility: as for the laſt ſtep <hi>Divinity,</hi> it
is diſputed in the fourth Part, <hi>lib.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Part of this Treatiſe, (entituled, <hi>of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi>)
is divided in two Books; in the firſt, the demonſtrations
of <hi>Sanderus, Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Leſſius,</hi> (three Jeſuits) are
anſwered, by which they endeavour to prove, <hi>that the Biſhop of</hi>
Rome <hi>is not Antichriſt.</hi> 2. The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is proved to
be Antichriſt by Scripture, Fathers, Popiſh Doctors, yea, by the
teſtimonies of ſome Popes themſelves.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Book, two marks of Antichriſt are chiefly inſiſted
upon, the firſt is, his <hi>defection, 2 Theſſ.</hi> 2. where it is proved,
that the Doctrine of the Modern Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is that defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
mentioned by the Apoſtle, and that in the firſt ſix Centuries
there was no ſuch thing, as the <hi>modern Popiſh Religion;</hi>
which is proved, by an <hi>induction</hi> of all the <hi>contraverted
<pb facs="tcp:64826:18"/>
points</hi> we have with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. Becauſe thoſe
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ordinarily object, that they have not
made a defection, becauſe it cannot be inſtructed at what time it
was made? by whom? and who reſiſted it? Two things are
proved in the ſaid Book; firſt, it is proved by Reaſon, Experience,
Scripture, Fathers, that a defection may be made, and yet it may
be unknown by whom it is made? at what time? and who firſt
reſiſted it? 2. It is proved by an induction, that moſt of the
moſt ſubſtantial Tenets of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſuch as <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
number of the Sacraments, communion under
one kind, ſacrifice of the Maſs, imperfection of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
equalling of traditions to it, adding a Apocrypha Books
to it, rejecting the Greek and Hebrew as not being authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
as making the corrupt vulgar Latine verſion authentick,
free-will Merits, juſtification by Works, caelibat of Prieſts, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping
of Images, invocation of Saints, ſet Faſts, Prayer for
the dead, Purgatory, Indulgences, works of ſuper-erogation,
all the ſteps of the Popes Supremacy,</hi> &amp;c.) were not only
not from the beginning, but alſo it is proved for the moſt part (by
teſtimonies of Popiſh Doctors themſelves) at what time? and
by whom? the ſaid Tenets, as innovations, were brought in the
Church.</p>
            <p>The ſecond mark of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> we inſiſt upon is, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>all ſort of deceiving and fraud,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. where it is
ſhewed, by what cheats the authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and
his Doctrine are maintained; ſuch as <hi>perverting, falſly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
and corrupting</hi> (by adding and paring of the <hi>indices ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorii</hi>)
all the Writings of the Ancients, Suppoſitions,
Revelations, Saints, Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> Thus I have repreſented unto
you, what I perform in this great Subject, and what method I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in it: By which it will appear to any reaſonable man, what
difference there is between this method, and that of others, if
<pb facs="tcp:64826:19"/>
I perform what I promiſe; of which, let the judicious Reader
be judge. Now followeth the third thing, which I deſired your
Lordſhips to take to conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> what my ſcope and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is? which is twofold, the firſt is, to refute thoſe marks,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> endeavour to perſwade
their Diſciples, that the ſaid Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hurch.</p>
            <p>The firſt mark is, <hi>a continual ſucceſſion of Biſhops;</hi> which
they take great pains to enumerat, from the dayes of the Apoſtles,
unto this time: In which mark ſhall be proved a four-fold cheat;
The firſt is, they make the world be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieve, that all thoſe Biſhops <hi>were
of a like greatneſs in Power and Authority;</hi> whereas it is
proved, that in the firſt three Centuries, or at leaſt before the dayes
of <hi>Cyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ian,</hi> that every Biſhop was <hi>of equal authority with the
Biſhop of</hi> Rome: And that between the times of <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
and the Council of <hi>Chalcedon, every Metropolitan,</hi> and from the
Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to <hi>anno, 604. every Patriarch were of equal
juriſdiction to him:</hi> And when he was made univerſal Biſhop
by <hi>Phocas,</hi> little more then a bare title was beſtowed on him,
and yet that was after revocked, by the ſixth general Council.
As for thoſe five ſteps we mentioned before (in which chiefly the
Modern Power of the Pope conſiſts) <hi>viz. Election by Cardinals;</hi>
2. <hi>Authority of convocating general Councils; 3. Temporal
juriſdiction; 4. Infability; 5. and Divinity,</hi> it ſhall be
proved (as we ſaid before) by the teſtimonies of Popiſh Doctors
themſelves, that the oldeſt of them, had not a beeing in the tenth
Age: and that the ſaid Popiſh Doctors, acknowledging the
ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> in the Monarchy
of the Church, nevertheleſs, ſome of them doubted not to call the
<hi>Biſhop of Rome Antichriſt,</hi> by reaſon of theſe ſteps, which
they call <hi>tyrannical Antichriſtian uſurpations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Cheat, in that <hi>mark of ſucceſſion</hi> is, that they
make ignorants believe, <hi>that all the Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>ſince
<pb facs="tcp:64826:19"/>
the times of the Apoſtles, profeſſed the ſame Doctrine which
is now taught in the Church of</hi> Rome: whereas it ſhall be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Doctrine of the modern Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had not a
beeing the firſt ſix hundred years after Chriſt; that it had ſome
notable beginning, about that time when <hi>Bonifacius</hi> 3d. was made
firſt <hi>univerſal Biſhop,</hi> and encreaſed afterwards, as the power of
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> encreaſed, the one following the other, as the
motion of the Sea follows the Moon; that many of the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
points of the modern Roman Faith, were never generally
eſtabliſhed, before the cape-ſtone of the Popes power was laid at
the Councils of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> at which two Councils, many
Tenets were eſtabliſhed, with an <hi>anathema,</hi> as Articles of Faith,
believed to be ſo many paradoxes by the moſt learned men in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who lived in thoſe times, who ſpared not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
againſt the fraudulent proceeding of the Pope, who carried
all by plurality of voices in theſe two Councils: 1. By multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Italian Biſhops; 2. By titular Biſhops, that is, Biſhops
having imaginary Titles in the Eaſt, as <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch,</hi> &amp;c.
Which Biſhops he created purpoſely, that by the number of their
voices, and of the Italian Biſhops, he might bear down in theſe
two Councils, the voices of the Biſhops of <hi>Germany, Spain</hi> and
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Cheat in that mark of ſucceſsion is, that they
make ignorants believe, that all thoſe Biſhops; <hi>were lawfully
elected:</hi> but it ſhall be proved in the following Diſput, that
ſome were elected by <hi>Blood,</hi> others by <hi>Simony,</hi> others by <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Stipulations, and Pre-contracts to eſtabliſh Hereſie in
the Church, and to condemn the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thodox Doctrine as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical;</hi>
others of them <hi>by a paction with the Devil;</hi> yea, it ſhall
be proved, by the moſt eminent Antiquaries of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, that ſince <hi>Nicolaus ſecundus,</hi> who lived in the
<hi>eleventh Century,</hi> there has not been one Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
elected <hi>according to the Law of God, and Conſtitutions of
<pb facs="tcp:64826:20"/>
the primitive Church:</hi> and that their manner of election, at
this day, is ſo deteſtable, that none can hear of it without
horror.</p>
            <p>The fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th Cheat in that mark of ſucceſſion is this, we have
redacted that ſucceſſion to a number of perſons, of unequal
power, contrary Doctrine, unlawfully elected; now reſts <hi>a bare
perſonal ſucceſſion,</hi> in which there is a notable Cheat alſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they obtrude for the true Succeſſor, perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
by their own principles, of the Function; as appears
by three unanſwerable reaſons: The firſt is, <hi>a woman was
Pope</hi> for ſeveral years together; and whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and
<hi>Baronius,</hi> affirms, it was a fiction; it is anſwered, ſince
thoſe Hiſtorians who relate it for a truth, lived in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſe very
times, in which it fell out, or at leaſt, very near them; and
ſince thoſe who call it a fable, lived long after, and are but of
yeaſter-day, in reſpect of thoſe who affirm it to be of a truth, no
judicious Reader needs to be puzled much, which party to believe;
ſince thoſe who called it a <hi>truth,</hi> profeſſed themſelves to be
as obedient Sons to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as thoſe who call it a
<hi>fable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon, againſt the continuity of that perſonal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion,
is this; the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been for ſeveral
years empty, and without a Biſhop: and whereas they affirm,
<hi>that the power then of the Biſhop, is in the Cardinals;</hi> it
ſhall be proved, by their own Learned Antiquaries, that the
modern power of thoſe Cardinals, was a thing unkown to
the Ancients; and to be nothing elſe, but a new deviſed
Cheat.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon, againſt that perſonal ſucceſſion; is this,
it is known to all who are verſed in Hiſtory, that many Popes have
been at one time, and the ſubtilleſt Wits amongſt them could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet decern, which was the true Succeſsor? and which not? one
part of the Church adhering to the one, another to the other, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:64826:20"/>
to the third Pope: As happened in the time of the Council
of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> anno, 1416. at which time there were three
Popes. It is certain, one of them could be only <hi>the true Pope,</hi>
and yet all of them created Cardinals; ſome of which not only
created other Popes afterwards, but alſo <hi>became Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi>
but thoſe Cardinals, <hi>who received orders from the falſe
Popes, are by their own Principles, incapable of electing Popes,
much more of being Popes themſelves.</hi> It muſt of neceſſity
follow, that many Popes have been at innumerable times, Biſhops
of <hi>Rome</hi> not lawful; which quite deſtroyes <hi>that perſonal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</hi>
They are preſſed with the ſame difficulty in the caſe of
<hi>Simony;</hi> It is granted by themſelves, that many Biſhops of <hi>Rome
have obtained that Chair by Simony:</hi> It is granted alſo by
them, <hi>that thoſe are not lawful Popes, that thoſe ordained by
them are incapable of Orders.</hi> It is confeſſed by them alſo,
that ſeveral Popes obtaining the Chair by <hi>Simony, have created
Cardinals which elected other Popes, and ſome of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
became Popes themſelves;</hi> which quite deſtroyeth <hi>that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
perſonal ſucceſſion,</hi> as they cannot deny. And this
much of that firſt mark of the true Church, pretended by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,
to prove <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be the true Church,</hi>
viz. <hi>ſucceſſion of Biſhops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond mark is Antiquity, of which they brag very much,
but have very little reaſon. <hi>Cicero, lib. 2. de Orator.</hi> relates
a paſſage between <hi>Craſſus,</hi> that famous Orator, and one <hi>Silus,</hi>
who accuſed another perſon before the Senate, for uttering ſome
dangerous expreſsions; <hi>Craſſus</hi> defends him thus, <hi>It may be,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>that he ſpake theſe words in paſſion;</hi> Silus <hi>granted
it might be: Craſſus</hi> urgeth the ſecond time, <hi>It may be you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
not what he ſaid; Silus</hi> ſeemed not averſe to that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>Craſſus</hi> goeth on the third time, <hi>It may be,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that
ye affirm, that ye heard him utter theſe ſpeeches, whereas ye
heard no ſuch thing at all:</hi> at which <hi>Silus</hi> was confounded, and
<pb facs="tcp:64826:21"/>
replyed nothing at all, then all the company fell a laughing. Thoſe
inſtances of <hi>Craſſus</hi> againſt <hi>Silus,</hi> may fitly be urged againſt our
Adverſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> bragging of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Antiquity, that is, of Councils and Fathers. His firſt
inſtance was, that the perſon accuſed by <hi>Silus,</hi> perhaps was in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but it is known, and ſhall be proved, that thoſe of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> are ſeconded by no teſtimonies of Antiquity at all, but
either they are of <hi>Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>themſelves, or elſe of their
flatterers.</hi> But <hi>Aeneas Silvius</hi> (afterwards Pope himſelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> 2d.) in his Commentaries upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Baſile,</hi> hath theſe following expreſsions againſt ſuch teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
his words are, <hi>Nec conſiderant miſeri quae tantopere
jactant verba, aut ipſorum ſummorum pontificum ſunt fimbrias
ſuas extendent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um, aut eorum qui iis adulabantur;</hi> that is,
<hi>Neither do theſe miſerable men conſider, that thoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of which they brag, are either of Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
enlarging their own Authority; or elſe of thoſe who
are their flatterers.</hi> Now to the application; <hi>Craſſus</hi> reaſoned,
that a teſtimony ſpoken in paſsion, ſhould not be regarded; but
who will deny thoſe teſtimonies of <hi>Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>and of their
vowed ſlaviſh flatterers,</hi> to be ſpoken in paſsion, to be partial, and
to merit no credit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Craſſus</hi> ſecond inſtance was, that perhaps <hi>Silus did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what the other ſaid:</hi> This is alſo fitly applyed to thoſe of
the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for, knowing that thoſe partial teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
would not ſerve the turn, they flye <hi>to fantaſtick Gloſſes of
teſtimonies of the Ancients,</hi> wearying themſelves and their
Readers, by their <hi>verboſity,</hi> in ſuch Gloſſes, though never ſo
<hi>ſtrained</hi> and <hi>wreſted againſt the meaning of the Author,</hi> as
ſhall be proved to any capacity, in the leaſt meaſure capable of
reaſon: and in effect, all the ſhelter they have in Antiquity,
is either in <hi>wilfully wreſting the Fathers,</hi> or elſe <hi>in their
ſtrained Allegories,</hi> as ſhall be made manifeſt in its own place,
<pb facs="tcp:64826:21"/>
               <hi>part. 4. lib.</hi> 2. yea, and almoſt through the whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
            <p>The third inſtance of <hi>Craſſus;</hi> againſt <hi>Silus,</hi> was <hi>falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing:</hi>
that this may be applyed, to our Adverſaries, ſhall be
proved alſo; that is, when thoſe teſtimonies of Popes and their
Fathers, and thoſe perverted and wreſted teſtimonies of others,
will not ſerve the turn, they uſe a twofold cheat, in <hi>falſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiing;</hi>
The firſt is, they have corrupted, by authority of the
Pope, all the Writings of the Ancients, taking out what made
againſt them. The ſecond cheat is, by <hi>putting in,</hi> and <hi>forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
what in effect, <hi>was never in the writings of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi>
as ſhall be unanſwerably proved in the following Diſput:
yea, it ſhall appear, <hi>part. 4. lib.</hi> 2. what thoſe <hi>forged teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
being removed, the primitive Fathers, in the firſt
ſix Centuries after Chriſt, proſeſſed no other Doctrine, then
the Doctrine now profeſſed by the Proteſtants, eſpecially by
the Church of</hi> England; which is the ſame Religion, with
that of the firſt four-general Councils, both in Doctrine and
Diſcipline, in the eſtimation of <hi>Gregorius Magnus</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> of little leſſe authority then the Scripture it ſelf. One
thing is not to be omitted, they object the Proteſtants ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unreverently of Antiquity, which is a notorious untruth,
whereas themſelves (when neither <hi>wreſting falſly, tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
adding and paring, and right-down forging teſtimonies
of Antiquity will ſerve the turn</hi>) ſpeak moſt unreverently of the
Ancients, taxing <hi>Auguſtinus, Hieronymus,</hi> the ſecond and fourth
general Councils, and conſequently, all the firſt eight general
Councils<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (ſince in the particulars challenged by them,
they all agreed) of <hi>ignorance, madneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hereſie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third mark is <hi>univerſality;</hi> which is all one with <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
univerſality</hi> is twofold, firſt of <hi>time,</hi> that is, <hi>the
Doctrine of the Modern Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was received at all
<pb facs="tcp:64826:22"/>
times by the Church.</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>of place,</hi> that is, <hi>it
was embraced in all places:</hi> but the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of their Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
being related, <hi>univerſality falls with it,</hi> and likewayes <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility;</hi>
for if we prove, that the Doctrine of the Modern
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (in as far as it contradicts that of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants)
is deviſed, and broached by degrees, ſince the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the ſeventh Century;</hi> queſtionleſs, it was not <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in the firſt</hi> ſix. <hi>Antiquity</hi> alſo, being refuted, their
fifth mark, <hi>infallibility</hi> alſo falls with it: for <hi>queſtionleſs, if
the Doctrine of the Modern Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>be contrary
to the Doctrine of the Primitive Church in the firſt ſix Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,
they cannot have the brow to affirm, that their
Modern Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is infallible,</hi> ſince in ſo affirming,
they will declare all the Ancients, that is, <hi>Fathers and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils,</hi> in the firſt ſix hnndred years after Chriſt, to
<hi>be Hereticks.</hi> However, <hi>it is moſt ſtrange impudence in
them to pretend infallibility in their Church,</hi> which ſome place
<hi>in general Councils, others in the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra:</hi>
which ever of the two they affirm, they are entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
<hi>If the firſt?</hi> in it appears that of late, their general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
<hi>hath condemned one another of Hereſie, as the Council</hi>
of <hi>Florence, the Councils of</hi> Baſil <hi>and</hi> Conſtance; <hi>and the
Council of</hi> Baſil, <hi>that of</hi> Florence: If they affirm in the laſt? (<hi>viz.
that the Pope hath Infallibility in</hi> Cathedra) they are alſo
entangled, for it ſhall be proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>part. 3 lib.</hi> 2. that many Popes
in <hi>Cathedra</hi> have declared <hi>other Popes teaching in</hi> Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra
<hi>to be Hereticks:</hi> but none but a mad man, or an Impoſtor
will affirm, that <hi>the infallibility of Popes in</hi> Cathedra, can
conſiſt with ſuch proceedings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſixth mark is</hi> Unity, <hi>of which they brag very much,
but with as little reaſon, as they did brag of</hi> Antiquity. <hi>They
reaſon very prettily thus:</hi> We of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſay
they) agree amongſt our ſelves, in all ſubſtantial points of
<pb facs="tcp:64826:22"/>
Faith: whereas they who are not of our Church, do not ſo;
ſome of them being <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> ſome <hi>Lutherians,</hi> ſome <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi>
ſome <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſome this, ſome that: whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
(<hi>ſay they</hi>) that our Church is the true Church.</p>
            <p>But this ſophiſm is very eaſily retorted: we may as eaſily rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thus; We, <hi>whom ye call Calviniſts,</hi> are at unity amongſt
our ſelves, in ſubſtantial points, (there is no diſcord amongſt us,
but in theſe two particulars, the firſt is, <hi>anent Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or the Divine right of Biſhops;</hi> the ſecond is in that
point, <hi>of defenſive Armes againſt Kings;</hi> both which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
eſpecially the laſt, are in a far higher ſtrain amongſt your
ſelves, as ye cannot without impudence deny) But ye who are out
of our Church, do not agree amongſt your ſelves, ſome of you are
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſome <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we are the
true Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to omit ſuch fooliſh reaſoning, there is not greater diſcord
in hell, then is amongſt thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in points moſt
ſubſtantial, and upon which, as hinges, the whole edifice of their
Doctrine doth depend. It would be prolix to enumerat all their
diſcords; we will only mention ſome few, the reſt we ſhall proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
through the whole body of this Treatiſe: And firſt, <hi>they
generally brag of the Antiquity of their Doctrine, that it was
from the beginning:</hi> but it ſhall be proved, by teſtimony of their
own Doctors, that moſt of their ſubſtantial Tenets, which they
hold contrary to Proteſtants, are ſo many <hi>innovations;</hi> ſuch as
<hi>adding of Apocrypha Books to the Scripture, number of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, Indulgences, and all
thoſe ſteps of the Popes Supremacy,</hi> after <hi>anno,</hi> 604. Yea,
it ſhall be proved by ſome of their greateſt Antiquaries, that the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was not acknowledged univerſal Biſhop by the
Church, in the firſt ſix Centuries; and that <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>
and many other of the Ancients, died out of communion
with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet are placed in their Calanders
amongſt the Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64826:23"/>
Likewayes, the whole body of the Popiſh Religion depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> it again upon the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of <hi>Peter,</hi> it again upon his <hi>inſtitution, carriage and
teſtimonies of Fathers.</hi> Let us hear how they agree in thoſe
three.</p>
            <p>And firſt, his inſtitution is founded upon three paſſages of
Scripture, <hi>Mat. 16. 18. Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock
will I build my Church.</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>verſe 19. And I will
give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</hi> The
third is, <hi>Joh. 21. 15. 16, 17. Feed my ſheep, feed my lambs.</hi>
But Cardinal <hi>Cuſanus,</hi> lib. 2. concord. Cathol. cap. 13. expreſly
affirmes, <hi>that in all thoſe three places, nothing was given in
peculiar to</hi> Peter, <hi>which was not given to all the Apoſtles,</hi>
which he alſo proves by the teſtimony of <hi>Hieronymus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The main <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Popes ſupremacy, is in the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theſe words, <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>is the
Rock upon which the Church is built. Pighius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi>
and others affirm, <hi>that all are ignorants, hereticks, mad men,
who acquieſced not in this expoſition, That</hi> Peter <hi>is the Rock:</hi>
But it ſhall be proved, in the firſt ſix Chapters of the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt Book, not
only by innumerable teſtimonies of Popiſh Doctors, but alſo of a
great many Popes themſelves, that not <hi>Peter,</hi> but the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
by <hi>Peter is the Rock,</hi> viz. Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>3. Another <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Popiſh Religion is, that <hi>Peter</hi> had
his juriſdiction immediatly from Chriſt, and the other Apoſtles
theirs from <hi>Peter (Bellarmine</hi> and others affirm, that if this be
not granted, the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter</hi> cannot be defended, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the whole
body of the Popiſh Religion falls with it) But <hi>Franciſcus de
victoria</hi> (affirmed by <hi>Canus</hi> to be the ableſt Divine of <hi>Spain</hi>)
exſibilats this diſtinction of <hi>Peters immediat juriſdiction,</hi> and
refutes the gloſs on <hi>Cyprian, de unitate Eccleſiae,</hi> for exponing
a paſſage in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> from which they gather this diſtinction,
<pb facs="tcp:64826:23"/>
proving by the teſtimonies of <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelf (in that very
place corrupted by the Gloſſe, which Gloſſe is approved by the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi>) that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in theſe words, expreſly diſputs
<hi>againſt that immediat Juriſdiction of</hi> Peter, and <hi>mediat</hi> of the
other Apoſtles; and affirms, that all the Apoſtles <hi>had,
not only their order, but alſo their Juriſdiction immediately
from Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. They prove the Supremacy of <hi>Peter,</hi> by his carriage and
prerogatives: <hi>but</hi> Salmero <hi>the Jeſuit, expreſly affirms,</hi> that
nothing can be gathered from the carriage of <hi>Peter,</hi> to prove
him oecumenick Biſhop, but much to the contrary; <hi>Yea, the
Council of</hi> Baſil <hi>it ſelf pronounced, that the Legats of the Pope</hi>
had no right of preſiding in general Councils, becauſe it <hi>could</hi>
neither be proved by Scripture, nor Antiquity, that
ever <hi>Peter</hi> preſided in any <hi>Council;</hi> or at that of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. They brag much of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that <hi>he is for the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of</hi> Peter, <hi>and alſo</hi> Auguſtin <hi>and other Fathers:</hi> but
<hi>Barronius</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, that both <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>
died out of communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
her encroaching upon the Churches of <hi>Africk,</hi> that is, for
admitting of Appellations, from <hi>Africk</hi> to <hi>Rome:</hi> for doing of
which, <hi>Bonifacius Secundus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> affirms, that
<hi>Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> were ſeduced by the Devil, and yet
both of them are placed in the Roman Callender as Saints: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all their braggings of <hi>Cyprian, (let one</hi> ſpeak for
all ſaith <hi>Barronius, in time moſt ancient, in learning moſt
excellent, in martyrdom moſt glorious, for the Supremacy
of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome) yet <hi>Stapleton</hi> the Jeſuit, expreſly
affirms, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in that ſubject, <hi>utitur verbis errantium,
&amp; mire hereticorum cauſae patrocinari videtur.</hi> And <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
himſelf confeſſeth, that we do not read, <hi>that ever</hi> Cyprian
<hi>was reconciled to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>after his reſiſting of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64826:24"/>
Stephanus <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>his pretending right of Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
from</hi> Africa.</p>
            <p>And this much of their concord, and unity, in that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
queſtion, of the Supremacy of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome: which
falling, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (as we ſaid) grants, that the whole body
of the Popiſh Religion falls with it, comparing it, without the
Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to a houſe without a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
a man when his head is ſtricken off, to ſtar-light without
the Sun. We could inſtance their diſcord, in many of their moſt
ſubſtantial Tenets; what queſtion is of greater importance, then
that of <hi>Tranſubſtantion?</hi> It is the general opinion of the
Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it was imbraced as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith from the beginning; and yet thoſe two great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Doctors, <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Bonaventur,</hi> expreſly maintain, that
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation was never believed as an Article of Faith,
before the Council of</hi> Lateran, anno, 1225. Yea, <hi>Scotus</hi>
expreſly affirms, were it not for the authority of that Council,
he would not believe it himſelf, it hath ſo little ground in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Antiquity. The main ground of which prodigious
Article, is thoſe words of our <hi>Saviour, Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi>
and other expreſſions of his, <hi>John</hi> 6. But it ſhall be proved,
<hi>part 4. lib.</hi> 2. by the teſtimonies of many Popiſh Doctors,
that nothing can be gathered from either place, for proving of
it. It were too prolix in this Preface, to mention all the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
of the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in their moſt
ſubſtantial Tenets: Your Lordſhips may read them at large, in
the following Treatiſe, almoſt through the whole body of it, but
moſt expreſly, <hi>part. 4. lib.</hi> 2 where your Lordſhips will not
only find <hi>Doctors contradicting Doctors, but alſo Popes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
Councils, Councils accuſing Popes, Councils accuſing
Councils, Popes in</hi> Cathedra, <hi>taxing Popes in</hi> Cathedra, <hi>of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,
Madneſſe, Ignorance.</hi> And this much of the ſixth
<pb facs="tcp:64826:24"/>
mark of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by which they pretend it is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>to be the true Church,</hi> viz. <hi>Unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeventh mark is <hi>Saints;</hi> they object to the Proteſtants,
<hi>that they lean too much on Chriſt, truſting nothing to their
own merits; which occaſions ſo much prophaneneſſe amongſt
them:</hi> but we (ſay they) the Church of <hi>Rome, are adorned
with innumerable Saints, ſtirred up to holineſs, becauſe
works are meritorious in the ſight of God:</hi> quis tulerit gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos,
de ſeditione quoerentes? Let us retex this mark of <hi>Saints,</hi>
that we may ſee what reaſon they have to brag of it: And firſt,
they cannot brag of <hi>the Sanctity of their Clergy;</hi> witneſſe the
exclamations of all Ages, <hi>againſt the corruption of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>when they got a little breathing
from perſecution;</hi> we need not mention the complaints, not
only of the Ancients, but alſo of modern Popiſh Doctors, againſt
the corruptions of the Clergy of <hi>Rome. Cyprian</hi> began the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
in his time, when the Church was yet under perſecution:
But when the Emperours became Chriſtians, the Clergy, by their
beneficence, became rich. <hi>Hieronymus</hi> in his time, thirteen
hundred years ago, was ſo irritated by the vicious lives of the
Roman Clergy, that (<hi>Damaſus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> dying, to whom
he was Secretary) he left <hi>Rome,</hi> and went to <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> to live
as a Monk, comparing <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Babylon, and the ſeat of the
Whore.</hi> Ammianus Marcellinus, (in the opinion of <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
a Pagan) declaimed bitterly againſt the viciouſneſſe of the
Roman Clergy: It were tedious to mention, the complaints of
theſe of the firſt ſix Centuries, againſt the viciouſneſs of the
Roman Clergy, as of <hi>Baſilius Magnus, Nazianzenus, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius,
Severus</hi> and others: as the greatneſſe of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> in power encreaſed, not only corruption in Doctrine, but
alſo in manners, encreaſed with it; And after the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
was made univerſal Biſhop, nothing could be added to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
of the Clergy. The complaints of <hi>Bernardus, Picus,
<pb facs="tcp:64826:25"/>
Merandula,</hi> are notorious, and innumerable others. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Clergy moved them, not onely to call <hi>Rome Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
but alſo conſequently, and not obſcurely, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome
Antichriſt:</hi> and yet both of them profeſsed themſelves, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Sons to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In a word, ſince the times
of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> no brave man lived in any Age unto this day, who
did not complain of the corruption of the Roman Clergy: and ſo
<hi>heir Clergy cannot be their Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, if they have little reaſon to brag of their Clergy,
they have far leſſe reaſon, <hi>to brag of the ſanctity of their
Popes: Baronius, Platina,</hi> and <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſse,
that the World never produced ſuch Monſters <hi>for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
Impoyſoners, Adulterers, Symoniacks, Witches,</hi> yea,
and <hi>Hereticks:</hi> who but a mad man will affirm, that ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
cannot erre teaching the Church? Surely <hi>Pighius</hi> was out of
his witts, <hi>teaching that a Pope could not be an Heretick;</hi>
and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> no leſs, for calling that opinion of <hi>Pighius, a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
opinion:</hi> their feaver now is turned to a Phrenſie; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of that Book entituled <hi>Cardinaliſmo</hi> (conſcious to all the
Caball of the Roman Clergy) affirms, that now they begin
to teach at <hi>Rome, that a Pope cannot be a reprobat;</hi> which at
laſt will turn to an Article of Faith, as well as <hi>infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe corruption of lives of the Clergy, doth not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity
infer a falſe Church: We do not affirm, that the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Clergy, or their Popes, proves them <hi>Idolaters in
Doctrine;</hi> we only affirm, that they have no reaſon to brag of
either of them, <hi>as Saints, to prove the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be
the true Church.</hi> And although they were ſo, it is no infallible
mark; for it may be affirmed, that the holyeſt of them all comes
ſhort of <hi>Novatus, Donatus,</hi> and other <hi>ancient Hereticks,</hi> or of
<hi>Tertullian;</hi> when he was a <hi>Montaniſt.</hi> We only ask of them,
where thoſe Saints are to be found, of which they brag ſo much,
if they be neither <hi>their Clergy,</hi> nor <hi>their Popes?</hi> They will
<pb facs="tcp:64826:25"/>
anſwer, they mean <hi>thoſe perſons canonized by the Pope, and
placed in their Calander.</hi> But we reply, they cheat egregiouſly;
firſt, it is reported of a certain mad-man in <hi>Athens,</hi> who imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>that all the Ships which came into the Harbour were his
own;</hi> ſo they, when they hear of any promiſes made to the Church,
they imagine, <hi>they are all made to the modern Church of</hi> Rome,
and when they hear of any <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> they believe, they
<hi>all profeſſed the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Rome. In reaſon
they can brag of no Saints, but thoſe who lived after the beginning
of the ſeventh Century, the Saints of the firſt ſix Centuries were
not of their Church at all: for, it ſhall be proved, <hi>part 4. lib.</hi> 2.
that the Saints, Fathers and Martyrs of the firſt ſix Centuries
condemn all the Tenets of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (of any moment
which they hold contrary to Proteſtants) as heretical, <hi>and are in
right down terms Proteſtants:</hi> yea, it ſhall be proved, by teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of their own Doctors, that many of theſe moſt eminent
Saints, <hi>died excommunicated by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
the pride of that Church;</hi> as Saint <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> and all
the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> in the time of <hi>Victor, anno,</hi> 195. Saint
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> and all the Churches of <hi>Africk</hi> in the time of <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about <hi>anno,</hi> 256. Saint <hi>Aurelius</hi> and
Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and all the Biſhops of <hi>Africk,</hi> in the times of
<hi>Sozimus, Bonifacius</hi> and <hi>Celeſtinus</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the
beginning of the fifth Age.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as for thoſe Saints, ſince the beginning of the ſeventh
Century, it is anſwered firſt, that albeit the Clergy of <hi>Rome call
them Saints, yet they thought the ſaid Clergy no Saints;</hi> ſuch
as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> and others, who moſt bitterly inveigh againſt
the corruption of the Roman Church; Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> expreſly
calls <hi>Rome</hi> a <hi>den of theeves,</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> mentioned by <hi>John</hi>
in the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> 2. How many of theſe modern Saints have
been proved cheats? It ſhall be proved, by teſtimonies of their
own Doctors, <hi>part 3. lib.</hi> 2. that the Pope hath <hi>no power to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize
<pb facs="tcp:64826:26"/>
Saints, and that the moſt part of their Saints are vile
Impoſtors, deviſed by Prieſts to cheat the ignorant people of
their money,</hi> and to <hi>make them offer oblations at their ſhrines.</hi>
It were prolix in this Preface to inſert the particulars, but that
<hi>Impoſtur</hi> of Saints, in many examples, ſhall be made unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
appear, <hi>part 4. lib.</hi> 2. And this much of <hi>Saints,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
mark of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt mark is <hi>Miracles;</hi> the Scripture informs us, that
<hi>Antichriſt ſhall deceive all the world by falſe miracles:</hi> It
ſhall be proved likewayes, <hi>part 4. lib.</hi> 2. by the teſtimony of the
moſt learned Popiſh Doctors, that <hi>Miracles are no true marks
of the true Church in theſe laſt times, but rather marks of
the Antichriſtian Church.</hi> 2. It ſhall be proved by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the ſame men, <hi>that moſt of the late miracles pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the moſt notable ones, are meet
Impoſturs,</hi> which we ſhall instance in the forementioned place,
And whereas they object, we have no miracles in our Church, it
is falſe, our Doctrine was confirmed, by the miracles performed,
by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; neither need we any other miracles,
ſince we profeſs the ſame Doctrine. And this much of thoſe
marks of the true Church, pretended by <hi>the Mannual of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies</hi>
to prove, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was ſuch;</hi> to refute
which, is my firſt ſcope and intention in this following Diſput.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſcope of the ſaid <hi>Manual of Controverſies</hi> was,
to perſwade the Proſelyts of this Nation, <hi>that it was not the
Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>that the Pope had power to
depoſe Kings, either Popiſh or Proteſtant; but only of ſome
particular perſons,</hi> whom they called <hi>the Popes flatterers:</hi> and
therefore, my ſecond intention is to prove, that the ſaid Author is
either ignorant in the Principles of his own Religion, or elſe he
is like Father <hi>Cotton</hi> the Jeſuit, who being demanded, if he
believed the Pope had power to depoſe Kings? anſwered, <hi>He did
not believe it in</hi> France, <hi>but if he were at</hi> Rome <hi>he would.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64826:26"/>
That this King-depoſing doctrine, <hi>is the Doctrine of the Church
of</hi> Rome, is proved by three reaſons, which will puzle the ſaid
Author very ſore to anſwer.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this, innumerable Books are printed, aſſerting ſo
much (the names of the Authors ſhall be cited afterwards)
ſome of which Books are dedicated to Cardinals, ſome to the Pope
himſelf; but thoſe Books are authorized (by thoſe who have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from the Pope to peruſe Books before they go to the Preſs)
with <hi>an Imprimatur and a Declaration, that they contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
contrary to the Catholick Doctrine:</hi> But, who but a
mad man, or an Impoſtor, will affirm, <hi>that any Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>is not the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of the Church of</hi> Rome? This is the Doctrine of the
Church of the whole Canoniſts, unanimouſly maintained by them,
and moſt of the Theologues, <hi>viz. that the Pope has direct
power in Temporals, or is direct Monarch of the whole world.</hi>
Some Theologues indeed, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, maintain, <hi>that
the power of the Pope is only indirect, in ordine ad ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia;</hi>
as when a King is an Heretick, or otherwayes encroacheth
upon the Liberties of the Church; or when he aſſumes any thing
to himſelf which the Pope ſayes belongs to him: but this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
is exſibilated now at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>heretical;</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
himſelf is taxed by <hi>Carerius</hi> of hereſie, for maintaining, <hi>that
the Pope hath no direct power in temporals.</hi> Yea, <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5th
with much ado, was hindered <hi>from burning theſe Books of</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine
<hi>de pontifice Romano,</hi> for denying <hi>that direct power
of the Pope in temporals;</hi> albeit <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the ſaid Books
gives power to the Pope <hi>indirectly, or in order to ſpirituals, to
depoſe Kings, to abſolve their Subjects from all fidelity to
them,</hi> and that <hi>their Subjects are oblieged at the Popes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
to riſe up in Arms against them,</hi> and conſequently to kill
them: but <hi>Bellarmines</hi> opinion is now thought too little, of the
Popes power; all the Theologues now, are for the <hi>direct domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb facs="tcp:64826:27"/>
of the Pope in temporals.</hi> And this much of the firſt
reaſon, proving, that this <hi>King-depoſing Doctrine is the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon is this, <hi>That is the Doctrine of the Church
of</hi> Rome, <hi>what is aſſerted by the Pope in</hi> Cathedra, <hi>or teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole Church: but the Pope in</hi> Cathedra, <hi>aſſumes
that power of depoſing of Kings unto himſelf,</hi> as appears by
his Bulls; as that of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the
fourth Emperor; that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<hi>Frederick:</hi> that of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the eighth, againſt <hi>Philip</hi> King
of <hi>France:</hi> that of <hi>Paulus</hi> the third, againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth
King of <hi>England:</hi> that of <hi>Paulus</hi> the fourth, againſt Queen
<hi>Elizabeth:</hi> that of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth, againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the third and
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Kings of <hi>France;</hi> in which Bulls they expreſly
affirm, <hi>that Kings reign by them, and that power is given
them from God to eſtabliſh, plant, build, root out, caſt down,
transfer Kingdoms at their pleaſure.</hi> The tenors of thoſe Bulls,
(too prolix to be inſerted here) ſhall be particularly mentioned
and ſet down, <hi>part 4. lib.</hi> 1. And this much of the ſecond
reaſon, that it is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome, that the</hi>
Pope has power to depoſe Kings.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon is this; the Popes have procured that power
to be conferred on them, by general Councils: as in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Lateran,</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> third; the Act of which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
is found in <hi>Bzovius, anno,</hi> 1215. parag. 3. and alſo in
<hi>Binius</hi> and <hi>Crab,</hi> in <hi>their Collection of Councils.</hi> It is found
likewayes in <hi>Baronius ad annum,</hi> 1102. numb. 1, 2, 3. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<hi>ad annum,</hi> 1116. numb. 5. and alſo <hi>ad annum,</hi> 1119. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in the Council of <hi>Trent, Seſſ. 25. Canon.</hi> 19. It is
ordained, that the Popes have power to depoſe any <hi>Dominum fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,
or Proprietar of any Land where a Duel is fought;</hi> in
which Canon, power of depoſing Kings <hi>tacitly, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
is attributed to the Pope.</hi> The Council thought it not fit,
<pb facs="tcp:64826:27"/>
in expreſs terms, to affirm, <hi>that the Pope had power to deprive
a King of his property in that caſe;</hi> and therefore, they made
the Canon in <hi>general termes,</hi> comprehending a <hi>King</hi> under <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus
fundi,</hi> or <hi>Proprietar</hi> in general. That this is the true
meaning of that Canon, appears, becauſe by reaſon of it mainly,
the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> did not acknowledge the Council of

that it is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome, that the
Pope hath power to depoſe Kings;</hi> to which may be added a
fourth, which is this, which is ſo evident, that it takes away all
doubt.</p>
            <p>The Pope <hi>hath innumerable times put that power in practice:</hi>
the firſt Pope we read attempted it, was Pope <hi>Conſtantine</hi> againſt
<hi>Philippicus</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> becauſe the ſaid <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippicus</hi>

being killed, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> got the Dutchy of <hi>Rome</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We read no more of the <hi>temporal uſurpations</hi> of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> before <hi>Gregory</hi> 7th, when (the race of <hi>Carolus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

What extremities the ſaid <hi>Gregory</hi> 7th. did put the Emperour

with <hi>Paſchalis</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> after which time, it was the

Emperor <hi>Frederick;</hi> of <hi>Boniface</hi> 8th. with <hi>Philip. le Bell,</hi>

The Stories of theſe two <hi>Henries</hi> of <hi>France</hi> is moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable.</p>
            <p>And thus we have proved, that it is both the Doctrine and the
Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath
power <hi>to depoſe Kings, to abſolve their Subjects from fidelity
towards them, to compell them to Arms againſt them, and
conſequently to kill them, and to acknowledge any for their
lawful Prince, whom the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhall appoint:</hi> How
this power of the Popes can conſiſt with Kingly Government, let
the Kings of the earth themſelves conſider. They make one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
yet, that it is not the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,
that the Pope hath power to depoſe Kings.</hi> By the anſwer of
<pb facs="tcp:64826:28"/>
which objection will appear, that encreaſe of Popery in a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
State, tends to the utter deſtruction both of King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and inconſiſtent with both. The objection is this.</p>
            <p>It is not the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>France,</hi> ſay they, that
the Pope has power to depoſe Kings, being rejected both by its
Doctrine, and by its Practice; ſince many of the Clergy of
<hi>France,</hi> hath writen againſt that Doctrine, and Books defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Opinion, (ſuch as that of <hi>Mariana</hi> the Spaniſh
Jeſuit, and others) have been burnt by publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>But this objection is anſwered by a twofold diſtinction; firſt
of <hi>Times,</hi> ſecondly of <hi>Cauſes</hi> wherefore Kings ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed?
As for <hi>Times</hi> when the Kings of <hi>France</hi> are <hi>low,</hi> or
<hi>high,</hi> in the laſt caſe, the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> ever parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their King againſt the Pope, excommunicating them, and
depoſing them: as appears, by the paſsages of <hi>Philip le

Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the firſt Caſe, when the Kings of
<hi>France</hi> are low, the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> ever partied the Pope,
excommunicating and depoſing their Kings; as appears, by the
paſſages of <hi>Henry</hi> 3d. and 4th. Kings of <hi>France,</hi> with <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5th. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is notorious, that the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by a decree, the Bulls of the ſaid <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5th. againſt the
ſaid two <hi>Henries</hi> Kings of <hi>France;</hi> in which Bulls they were
declared <hi>uncapable of the Crown of</hi> France, <hi>all French men
were abſolved from alledgeance to them,</hi> and the greateſt part
of <hi>France</hi> roſe up in armes againſt them, to dethrone them, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Pope, that he would name them a King, and they
would acknowledge him for their lawful Prince. And this much
of the diſtinction of Times.</p>
            <p>The ſecond diſtinction is of <hi>Cauſes,</hi> wherefore Kings ſhould
be depoſed? although in other cauſes (beſides Hereſie) the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>France</hi> were not ſo unanimous for the Pope againſt their
<pb facs="tcp:64826:29"/>
King; yet in caſe of Hereſie, that is, if their King were a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
both the Clergy and the Laity of <hi>France,</hi> unanimouſly at
the Popes command, renunced alledgeance to their King: And
firſt for the Clergy, in an Aſsembly of States or Parliament,
Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> their Speaker commiſsionat from them as their
mouth, in an Oration to the third Eſtate, affirmed, <hi>That it had
ever been the Doctrine of the Clergy of</hi> France, <hi>that true
French men ought no alledgeance to heretical Kings, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
and depoſed by the Pope.</hi> As for the Laity, it is
notorious, that after the murther of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. they threatned to
abandon <hi>Henry</hi> 4th his Succeſſor, becauſe <hi>he was excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and depoſed by the Pope;</hi> which forced him (expecting no
ſecurity otherwayes) to change his Religion.</p>
            <p>And thus we have proved, that it is the unanimous Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome, that Popiſh Subjects owe no fidelity
to a Proteſtant King;</hi> which occaſioned that ſaying of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Biſhop <hi>Mortoun,</hi> viz. <hi>That a loyal popiſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in a Proteſtant State, was a white Ethiopian:</hi> which I do not
mention, calling in queſtion the Loyalty of the Romaniſts of this
Nation, or the neighbour Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them <hi>are known to be perſons of Honour, and as loyal
Subjects as the King hath:</hi> I only mention thoſe things, to let
them ſee how they are abuſed by the Popiſh Emiſſaries of theſe
three Nations, who knowing them <hi>to be loyal Subjects to the
King,</hi> ſeing it would be a great difficulty to train them in their
ſnares, and keep them in them once catched, if they told them all
the verity. To train them on, they make them believe in the
beginning, <hi>that it is not the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Rome,
<hi>that the Pope hath power to depoſe Proteſtant Kings, (much
leſs others) but only a calumny of Proteſtants, traducing
the Popiſh Religion:</hi> but afterwards, having by degrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
them in the Popiſh Religion, they would not fail to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
them, <hi>to cut the throats of all their Countrey-men, and
<pb facs="tcp:64826:29"/>
flee like ſo many mad-dogs upon the Kings face, to pull him
from his Throne;</hi> as appears by the conſtant practice of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt all Proteſtants in general, and againſt
Proteſtant Kings in particular: which practice is ſo notorious,
that he who denyes it, is either a mad man, void of common ſenſe,
or elſe a notorious Impoſtor.</p>
            <p>And firſt, that it is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,
affirming it meritorious, to deſtroy Proteſtants by open cruelty
and perfidy.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> appears by the conſtant carriage of the ſaid Church
towards Proteſtants, ſince the Reformation: What ſort of cruelty
or perfidy have they not attempted? Death without torture was
thought clemency; burning of them in heaps alive in houſes,
might be attributed to a popular fury, but it is notorious, that
multitudes of them were burnt alive in fires, of all Sexes and
Qualities, by the ſentences of the Judges; and when they could
do no good by open force, they deſtroyed them <hi>by perfidy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the publick Faith,</hi> and when they had done, made
publick Proceſsions of Joy, Bonefires, and ſuch like, as if they
had deſerved Paradiſe by ſuch meritorious works; maintaining
this <hi>maxime</hi> as unqueſtionable, <hi>that no publick Faith ſhould be
regarded or obſerved towards Hereticks.</hi> That this is truth,
appears by the proceedings of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> with
<hi>John Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> which two were burned
alive, notwithſtanding they had the ſafe conduct of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<hi>Sigiſmundus.</hi> It appears alſo, by thoſe maſſacres of <hi>Paris,</hi>
and other parts of <hi>France,</hi> where, by the publick Faith, they train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them all to one place, and then perfidiouſly maſſacred them, to
the horror of ſeveral learned Romaniſts, who in their Hiſtories,
deteſt ſuch perfidy, ſuch as <hi>Thuanus</hi> and others: and when they
had done, <hi>tanquam re bene geſta triumpharunt,</hi> they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated
by the Pope; who cauſed Bonefires and publick Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to be made at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the happy ſucceſs of ſuch a glorious
atchievment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64826:30"/>
Theſe things are notorious, ſo that the Popiſh emiſſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
have neither the brow to deny them, nor the confidence
to defend them: But they uſe another ſhift, <hi>viz. That the
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath given over that practice now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſolved no more to follow thoſe courſes, as they did
in the beginning,</hi> prompted to them, by their too violent
zeal.</p>
            <p>But it is anſwered, they are greatly miſtaken, for now in
<hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and other places, they practiſe not
ſuch cruelties, becauſe they dare not, but where they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and thinks they may do it without any hazard; they make
it appear, that they believe, it is a meritorious work, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
and extirpat all Proteſtants, by any cruelty, or perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
imaginable: as appears of late, not only abroad, by the
proceeding of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> at the Popes <hi>Inſtigation,</hi>
againſt theſe of the Vallies of <hi>Piemont,</hi> by which innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
perſons, were deſtroyed by ſuch cruelty and perfidy, as
the like hath not been recorded in any Hiſtory, which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
at large, in a great Volum, publiſhed by an eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse
of them: But alſo at home; what cruelties were exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> none needs to be informed? And this much of the
Inclinations of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to Proteſtants in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>What good-will they have to Proteſtant Kings, they are blind
who ſees not? All Proteſtants are excommunicate at their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilees;
but it is a meritorious work, to kill an excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
perſon, though he be a King; when <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. and
<hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. Kings of <hi>France,</hi> were excommunicated by
the Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5th. the firſt of them was murthered by a

Who ſeeth not, that all this was done, <hi>to encourage all to kill

him in his own Chamber in the mouth, there being none in
the Room beſide, but onely an other Nobleman; which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
ſo ſubtilly, that neither the King, nor the Nobleman
perceived him in the Action: till at laſt the Noble man, for
his own vindication, catched him by the arm, affirming, <hi>that
either he or himſelf had wounded the King, and it was fit,
they were both arreſted, till it were known, which of them
two it was?</hi> There were other innumerable attempts of aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines

            <p>And this much of <hi>France;</hi> we have many examples at home,
that the Bigots of the Popiſh Religion, think it a meritorious work,
(encouraged by their Confeſſors) to attempt upon the lives of
Proteſtant Princes, excommunicated and depoſed by the Pope:
We have many inſtances in Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who all her life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb facs="tcp:64826:31"/>
was vexed by the doubled and re-doubled attempts to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her; and when the malefactors were apprehended, they were
ſo far from acknowledging their fault, that they gloried in it,
profeſsing <hi>it was no ſin, but meritorious, to kill an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
Tyrant, neither were they oblieged to acknowledge,
for their lawful Prince, thoſe who were excommunicated by
the Pope.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> alſo was very near having a ſhare in
thoſe popiſh Practices, in <hi>the Powder-plot,</hi> if it had not been
diſcovered by a miraculous providence: <hi>Valentia</hi> and other Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
abroad, were not aſhamed (tacitly and conſequentially) to
defend it; that is, they maintained openly in their Writings,
<hi>that thoſe who violat the Oath of Supremacy and Alledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
were not perjured, becauſe that Oath was never obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi>
Our preſent Emiſſaries perſwades their Proſelyts, that the
ſaid Powder-plot was but a fiction, deviſed by Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi>
to make the popiſh Religion odious; by which it appears, of
what mettal thoſe men are. And this much of my ſecond ſcope,
<hi>viz.</hi> to prove in this work, that it was the Doctrine of the Church
of <hi>Rome, that the Pope had power to depoſe Kings, and
popiſh Subjects ought no alledgeance to a Proteſtant Prince;</hi>
and that encreaſe of Popery could not conſiſt in a Proteſtant State,
with the ſafety of either King or Subject: and who affirm the

faithfully, which if he perform, he cannot in reaſon be blamed,
although the reaſons <hi>hinc inde,</hi> be never ſo weak, or not perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
otherwayes, he is guilty of forgery. I play the part of a
Clerk, not of a Judge; which if I do unfaithfully, let any put
me to it, either in privat or in publick, and if I do not vindicat
my ſelf, I deſerve the character of <hi>an Impoſtor.</hi> It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that I mention ſome teſtimonies of Fathers, which I did not
ſee in the Originals; but there is not one of theſe teſtimonies,
but I can inſtruct, that they are cited by popiſh Authors themſelves,
or if they be not, I can inſtruct by the <hi>Originals,</hi> that they are
falſly cited by the ſaids popiſh Authors, that is, that they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
falſly tranſlated out of the Greek (as I inſtance in ſeveral

and that the Fathers affirm no ſuch thing as they pretend.
Of their mutilating of teſtimonies, I will only inſtance two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
or three at moſt; The firſt is, <hi>Ambroſius</hi> affirms, <hi>We
uſe to follow the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in all things; Bellarmine</hi>
with great pomp concludes, that from theſe words, <hi>Ambroſius
aſſerts neceſſar communion with the Church of</hi> Rome: but he

that is, <hi>albeit we uſe to follow the Church of</hi> Rome (<hi>it

Church, calling that Title <hi>ſacrilegious and blaſphemous;</hi> and

be called Monarch of the Church or oecumenick Biſhop, it
was</hi> Peter, <hi>becauſe the care of the whole Church was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him; but notwithſtanding of that, he was not oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick
Biſhop, or univerſal Biſhop, or Apoſtle.</hi> Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
will find many inſtances of that kind, diſperſed through the
following Treatiſe, and alſo their <hi>falſe tranſlations:</hi> yea, they do
not produce one teſtimony (<hi>except either of Biſhops of</hi> Rome,
<hi>or their flatterers,</hi> which ſort of teſtimonies are rejected by
<hi>Aeneas Silvius,</hi> afterwards Pope himſelf, as meriting no credit)

            <p>It may be objected ſecondly againſt me, that my Stile is rude;
But I anſwer, <hi>a key of Iron, if it open the door with facility,
is to be preferred to one of Gold, which doth it with difficulty.</hi>
The Diſcourſe for the moſt part is <hi>Dogmatick,</hi> in which Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
is rather hurtful then profitable; the ſtrained Rhetorick of
the Fathers hath ſet us all by the ears together. Moſt of the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which our Adverſaries have in the Writings of the Fathers,
<hi>is in their too high ſtrained Allegories,</hi> as will be proved by an
induction of all thoſe Controverſies we have with the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> We will give an inſtance or two in this Preface, of which
your Lordſhips will find innumerable, diſperſed through the whole
Diſput, eſpecially <hi>part 4. lib.</hi> 2. where <hi>the newneſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

Firſt, to prove neceſſar communion with the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or the infallibility of the particular Church of <hi>Rome,
Bellarmine</hi> cites <hi>Cyprian,</hi> affirming, <hi>that Perfidy can have
no acceſſe to that Church:</hi> which expreſſion of his, is found
in an Epiſtle of his, written to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
That this is onely <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and a <hi>Complement,</hi> appears
by innumerable other Epiſtles of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> in which he taxeth
<hi>Stephanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the particular Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Ignorance, Arrogancy,</hi> and <hi>Patronizing of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;</hi>
yea it is notorious, and confeſsed by our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
that he died out of communion with the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> and yet (as we ſaid) he is a Saint in the Roman
Callander.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, produce many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Fathers, to prove the Supremacy of <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe
they call him <hi>Head and Prince of the Apoſtles,</hi> that this is
only Rhetorick, is notorious, for two reaſons: firſt, it ſhall be
proved, that theſe very Fathers expreſly affirm, and prove,
<hi>that</hi> Peter <hi>had no Supremacy over the Church, or other
Apoſtles:</hi> but that all the Apoſtles were <hi>of alike Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Dignity, and Power with him.</hi> 2. Becauſe theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Fathers, complement others alſo, with the ſame title <hi>of
Head and Prince,</hi> as they do <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> yea, <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi>

when he had ſo ſayed, he adds, <hi>ne dicam amplius;</hi> which is
as much as to ſay, that in his opinion, Paul <hi>was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to</hi> Peter. 3. To prove <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> they bring
many teſtimonies of the Fathers, ſuch as theſe, <hi>This Bread
which you ſee, is not common Bread, but the Fleſh of

reaſon is unanſwerable, that thoſe expreſsions are only <hi>Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>

the Inſtitution of Peters Monarchy.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was proved in the Preface, that the truth or
falſhood of the Modern Roman Faith depended
upon that of the Supremacy of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome:</hi> which is the true reaſon, why the braveſt
ſpirits of both ſides ruſh together with ſuch ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity
in this conteſt: the one to aſſert it, the other to aſſault
it: both parties pretending Scripture, Reaſon, Councils, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64826:34"/>
and each party upbraiding other with wreſting of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Sophiſtry, perverting, and forging teſtimonies of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
When I conſidered theſe high and mutual reflections
of thoſe not only learned, but pious men of both ſides (as
cannot be denyed) curioſity moved me to ſtudy the Conteſt,
that I might perceive (if I could) which Party was to blame:
and when I had ſo done, I reſolved to minut the Diſput, as
a Clerk doth thoſe pleadings before a Judge; omitting <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticiſms,
Criticiſms,</hi> and <hi>Rhetorical digreſſions,</hi> I only
mention the moſt ſubſtantial Arguments, and anſwers, <hi>Hinc
inde;</hi> doing what I could for the benefit of Perſons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of both Religions, (to whom I am many ways ingaged)
whoſe condition, and abilities or leaſure requires rather to
catch the <hi>Partridge</hi> in the neſt in a compendious Treatiſe, then
to hunt her in the Woods, Fields, and Mountains of vaſt and
volumnious <hi>Authors,</hi> though never ſo learned. If any affirm that
I play not the <hi>Clerk</hi> faithfully in minuting this Diſput, let
him put me to it, either in privat, or publick: and if I do not
vindicate my ſelf, let me be eſteemed an <hi>Impoſtor</hi> and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for forgery: and leſt any think I cheat in citations, I am
able to juſtify, that I make uſe of no paſſages, but thoſe which
are acknowledged by both ſides: where the Diſput is, about
the true meaning of the words, and (which not ſeldom falls
out) whether the teſtimony be forged or not?</p>
               <p>The whole Diſput conſiſts in the examination of thoſe three
Queſtions.</p>
               <p>1. Whether the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was ordained by our <hi>Savior
Viſible Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> under himſelf, or ſubordinat <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi>
of the Church?</p>
               <p>2. If at the command of Chriſt, the ſaid Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> fixed
the ſeat of his particular <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> at <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> by Divine inſtitution ſucceeds to
<hi>Peter,</hi> in the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64826:34"/>
If the affirmitives of thoſe three queſtions be true, without
all queſtion, <hi>Communion with the Church of Rome is neceſſar
unto Salvation, and the Religion of</hi> Proteſtants <hi>is a new
ſprung-up Hereſie:</hi> But if any one of thoſe three <hi>Affirmatives</hi> be
falſe (much more all three) it is as certain, that the Faith of
the <hi>Modern Roman Church</hi> is an idolatrous and heretical
novelty: none can ſucceed to <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the
Church, if <hi>Peter</hi> was not himſelf <hi>Monarch of the Church:</hi>
Neither can the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> ſucceed to <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>
of the Church, albeit <hi>Peter</hi> were <hi>Monarch</hi> of the Church
himſelf, except <hi>Peter</hi> were alſo <hi>Biſhop of Rome.</hi> Again, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<hi>Peter</hi> had been both <hi>Monarch of the Church,</hi> and <hi>Biſhop
of Rome,</hi> it doth not follow that the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> ſucceeded
to <hi>Peter</hi> by Divine inſtitution in the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the Church;
unleſs it be made out otherwiſe by Scripture, or unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable
Antiquity. <hi>Calvin, lib. 4. Inſt. cap. 6. num.</hi> 8.
rightly obſerves, that <hi>Peter</hi> might have had ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
priviledge in his own perſon, to which none ſucceeded
after him.</p>
               <p>The firſt two queſtions, or <hi>Biſhoprick of Peter</hi> are diſputed
in this firſt Book, the third queſtion in the following Books.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> or his univerſal <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> is diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto <hi>chap.</hi> 22. his particular <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> from
thence to the end. His <hi>Monarchy</hi> is diſputed three ways. Firſt,
from his inſtitution, unto <hi>chap.</hi> 15. Secondly, from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
and carriage, unto <hi>chap.</hi> 19: Thirdly, by teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Fathers, from thence to <hi>chap.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>His inſtitution again is aſſerted unto <hi>chap.</hi> 11. and aſſaulted
from thence unto <hi>chap.</hi> 15. His inſtitution is aſſerted by three
teſtimonies of Scripture and aſſaulted by as many. The three te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
by which it is aſſerted; are firſt, <hi>Mat. 16. 18. Thou
art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church.</hi> The ſecond
is, <hi>Matthew 16. 19. And I will give unto thee the keys of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64826:35"/>
Kingdom of Heaven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind upon Earth
ſhal be bound in Heaven: and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe upon
Earth, ſhal be looſed in Heaven.</hi> The third paſſage is, <hi>John</hi> 21.
15, 16, 17. <hi>Feed my Lambs, Feed my Sheep.</hi> Thoſe three teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
are the main Foundation of the faith of the <hi>Roman
Church.</hi> If <hi>Peter</hi> be not ordained Monarch of the Church in
thoſe three teſtimonies, he is ordained Monarch of the Church
no where: and if he be ordained Monarch of the Church
no where, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did not ſucceed to him in the
Monarchy of the Church: and if the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did not
ſucceed to him in the Monarchy of the Church, the faith of
the <hi>Modern Roman Church</hi> is a cheat, communion with it is ſo
far from being neceſſar unto Salvation, that Salvation cannot
conſiſt with it (we ſpeak not of Gods ſecret providence) ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily.
This ſort of reaſoning is approved by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf
in the preface of his diſput <hi>de Pont. Rom.</hi> where he calls that
controverſie of the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> a debate
<hi>de ſummârei Chriſtianae;</hi> that is, whether Chriſtianity can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
or not? By <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
no queſtion he means the doctrin of the Modern Church
of <hi>Rome:</hi> and ſince in that expreſſion he grants, that it cannot
ſubſiſt without the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt
of neceſſity grant, that the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
(having no ground in Scripture or Antiquity) the Doctrine of
the Modern Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is warrantable by neither: which
is further confirmed, becauſe in the ſame place he affirms, that
the Chriſtian Faith without the Supremacy of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome, Is like a houſe without a foundation, a body without a head,
Moon-ſhine without the Sun:</hi> which is as much to ſay, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the doctirne of the
Modern Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is nothing at all; ſince it is notorious
that a houſe without a foundation, a body without a head,
Moon-light without the Sun, are things impoſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64826:35"/>
Since it is ſo then, if the Ancients, Fathers and Councils did
not believe that <hi>Peter</hi> was ordained Monarch of the Church in
thoſe three fore-mentioned paſſages of Scripture; queſtionleſs
they did not believe the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
if they did not believe the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
it followeth of neceſſity that they did not believe any neceſſar
communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> notwithſtanding all the
braggings of our adverſaries to the contrair, boaſting that the
whole current of Antiquity is for them. Whether their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be true or not, will appear by the following enquiry?
<hi>viz.</hi> What were the opinions of the Ancients concerning thoſe
three paſſages of Scripture pretended by our adverſaries for
the inſtitution of <hi>Peters</hi> Monarchy? By which enquiry will
appear alſo by infallible conſequence, what opinion the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
had of neceſſar communion with the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> So
it may be affirmed that the examination of thoſe three paſſages
is a compendious diſput of the whole controverſies, which we
have with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

is the place in which our Adverſaries have moſt confidence. It
may be ſafely ſaid, that if <hi>Peter</hi> be not ordained Monarch of
the Church in thoſe words, he is no where elſe. If any would
yet have a more compendious Diſput of the controverſies, it
is to be found in this paſſage alone? For if in the opinion of
Antiquity, <hi>Peter</hi> was not ordained Monarch of the Church,
or promiſed to be ordained Monarch of the Church in
this paſſage; queſtionleſs, they neither believed the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy

of <hi>Peter,</hi> nor of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor neceſſar commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſince the laſt two (as we ſaid)
depend upon the firſt: and therefore we will examine this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
the more acuratly. Firſt, by Scripture and Reaſon. Next,
(becauſe they brag ſo much of Antiquity) by teſtimonies of
Councils and Fathers. In the laſt place, (becauſe they brag
ſo much of Unity) by <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Doctors.</hi> Of which
in Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Adverſaries reaſon thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He who is the <hi>Rock</hi> upon which the Church is built, is
<hi>Viſible head</hi> of the Church, or <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop.</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi>
is the <hi>Rock</hi> or <hi>Foundation</hi> upon which the Church is built,

upon this Rock I will build my Church.</hi> Ergo, Peter <hi>is Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered: Firſt, It is falſe that the Church is built
upon <hi>Peter</hi> as a <hi>Rock.</hi> Secondly, Although our Savior
had called <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Rock,</hi> it doth not follow that he ordained
him <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> as ſhal be proved, <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Peter</hi> is not the <hi>Rock,</hi> we will diſput: Firſt, By <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Secondly, by <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

1. <hi>Cor. 3. 11. For other Foundation can no man lay, then that is

               </p>
               <p>Bellarmin <hi>anſwers, That Chriſt is only the</hi> Primary Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<hi>but</hi> Peter <hi>is the</hi> Secondary Foundation. <hi>If this were

               <p>But it is replyed: Firſt, That <hi>Bellarmin</hi> cannot apply his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of <hi>ſecondary foundation</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> alone by this paſſage,
ſince the Apoſtle expreſly affirms, That all the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

they are all <hi>Oecumenick Biſhops,</hi> which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> will not

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would have diſtinguiſhed far better
foundations in <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>improper.</hi> Chriſt is properly the

               <p>Bellarmin <hi>objects; Secondly,</hi> Apocalyps 21. 14. And the wall
of the City had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the
twelve Apoſtles of the Lamb. <hi>Where, ſaith he, all the twelve
Apoſtles are called</hi> foundations.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered: Firſt, Although they were, yet it makes
not much for <hi>Bellarmins</hi> purpoſe: for if all the twelve Apoſtles
be <hi>ſecondary foundations, Peters</hi> being <hi>ſecondary foundation</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64826:37"/>
doth not conclude him to be Oecumenick Biſhop, no more
then it doth the reſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is falſe that the twelve Apoſtles are called
foundations in that place: <hi>John</hi> only affirms, that the names
of the twelve Apoſtles were written upon the foundation of
that new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Although both</hi> Haimo <hi>and</hi> Lyranus <hi>interpret the
Apoſtles to be foundations, yet they give the ſame gloſs which
they gave upon</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 11. viz. <hi>Becauſe of the Doctrine
which they preach: the words of</hi> Haimo <hi>are,</hi> Et in ipſis fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentis,

<hi>The ſame is the explication of</hi> Aretas <hi>upon this place
of the</hi> Apocalyps, <hi>viz.</hi> The Apoſtles are called foundations, becauſe
of their preaching Chriſt, and dying for him or the faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stapleton</hi> anſwers to that place of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. ſome other

except ye expreſs it thus, <hi>another</hi> and a <hi>different. Paul,</hi>
ſaith he, affirmeth that there is not <hi>another</hi> foundation but
Chriſt; but he doth not affirm that there is not a <hi>different</hi>
foundation from Chriſt: Which two he diſtinguiſheth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Peter,</hi> ſaith he, is not <hi>another foundation</hi> from Chriſt,
differing eſſentially; but only <hi>a different foundation,</hi> that is,
differing accidentally: Chriſt, ſaith he, is the principal foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
<hi>Peter</hi> is the ſubordinat and miniſterial foundation.</p>
               <p>But this ſubtilty of <hi>Stapleton</hi> is to no purpoſe: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                  </gap>

                  </gap>, a thing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
accidentally.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his diſtinction is refuted by the very text it ſelf:
for after <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Nemo poteſt aliud fundamentum ponere,</hi> he
adds, <hi>praeter id quod poſitum eſt, quod eſt Ieſus Chriſtus.</hi> By
which words he expreſly excluds all other foundations beſide
Chriſt, whether they differ in nature, or accidentally.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in what ſenſe can <hi>Stapleton</hi> affirm, that Chriſt and
<hi>Peter</hi> are foundations in the ſame ſpecifical nature, differing
only in accidentals, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> two individuals? For
Chriſt is properly a foundation upon which the Edifice of the
Church is built: <hi>Peter</hi> is only a foundation, becauſe he laid the
foundation on Chriſt. Theſe two foundations have nothing
but the name <hi>common,</hi> as <hi>Taurus</hi> the mountain, <hi>Taurus</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation,
and <hi>Taurus</hi> a bull.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Stapleton</hi> ſpeaks contradictions, in affirming,
that a principal foundation, and a ſubordinat foundation have
the ſame ſpecifick nature, and differ only accidentally as two
individuals, <hi>v. g. Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul:</hi> which is all one as ye would
ſay, The power of a King, &amp; that of his under-officer were the
ſame; the ſame power in nature, differing only accidentally.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Stapleton</hi> contradicts himſelf in another place; for
in his relections, controverſ. 3. <hi>queſt. 1. art. 1. concluſ.</hi> 3. he
expreſly affirms that <hi>Peter</hi> is <hi>Fundamentum prima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ium in ſuo
genere quale Chriſtus eſt in alio genere:</hi> which is diametrally
oppoſit to what he affirms here. Here he affirms <hi>Peter</hi> is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat
and Miniſterial foundation, there he calls him a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
foundation: here he affirms the foundation of Chriſt and
<hi>Peter</hi> to be of the ſame nature <hi>ejuſdem ſpecies;</hi> there he affirms
they are of different natures, <hi>toto genere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, this diſtinction of <hi>Stapletons</hi> is againſt all Antiquity,
affirming that the meaning of the Apoſtle admites of no proper
Foundations but Chriſt alone. So <hi>Hieronymus, Theodor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tos,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64826:38"/>
Chryſoſtomus, Oecumenius, Lyranus, Solus Chriſtus, vel fides ipſius,
eſt fundamentum, Chriſt only, or the faith of Chriſt is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we have diſputed by Scripture, that Chriſt is the
only Rock or Foundation; and conſequently <hi>Peter</hi> cannot be
the Rock on which Chriſt promiſeth to build his Church, in
thoſe words, <hi>Tu es Petrus, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place it is proved by reaſon, One thing cannot be
ſignified by a name, and its denominative: <hi>Petra,</hi> or <hi>the Rock,</hi>
is the name; <hi>Petrus, Peter or ſtony,</hi> is the denominative from
that name. Ergo the <hi>Rock</hi> is not <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Petrus</hi> is of the maſculine gender, and of the ſecond
perſon: <hi>Petra,</hi> or the <hi>Rock,</hi> is of the feminine gender, and third
perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> anſwers, <hi>Petra</hi> and <hi>Petrus</hi> are expreſſed in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
tongue, (in which our Savior ſpoke) by the ſame word
<hi>Cephas,</hi> which removes thoſe difficulties, ſince our Savior
ſpoke thoſe words in the <hi>Syrian</hi> tongue.</p>
               <p>It is replyed, firſt, it is falſe that <hi>Cephas,</hi> ſignifying a ſtone or
<hi>Petram,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> ſignifying ſtony or <hi>Petrum,</hi> are the ſame
words in the <hi>Syrian</hi> tongue, becauſe <hi>Cephas,</hi> ſignifying a ſtone,
is of the feminine gender; as appears by the <hi>Syriack</hi> verſion,
1 <hi>Cor. 11. Mat. 22. Mark</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Matthew</hi> the Apoſtle himſelf queſtionleſs knew
the meaning of Chriſt in theſe words, as well as <hi>Bellarmin, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,
Stapleton</hi> or <hi>Sanderus:</hi> but he in his Goſpel expreſly
affirms, <hi>Tu es Petrus, &amp; ſuper hanc Petram adificabo Eccleſiam
meam.</hi> But if <hi>Peter</hi> had been the Rock, <hi>Matthew</hi> would have
rendred theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Thou art the Rock, and upon
this Rock I will build my Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here is to be obſerved the impudence, if not blaſphemy, of</hi>
Petrus de Bollo, <hi>a Pariſian Divine in his authentick probation
of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, having theſe words,</hi> Scimus quod
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64826:38"/>
interpres Matthaei Syri, Graecus &amp; Latinus, non fit hoc loco optimè
de hac noſtrae fidei parte promeritus. Si enim dixiſſet, Et tu es
Petra, &amp; ſuper hanc Petramres fuiſſet multò clarior: cum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,
qui Syriacè procul dubio loquebatur, dixerit, Tu es Petra, &amp;
ſuper hanc Petram adificabo Eccleſiam meam: We know that the
Greek and Latin Interpreter of Matthew (who wrote in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
tongue) have not deſerved much of our faith; for if he had
rendred the words, Thou art the Rock, and upon this Rock I
will build my Church, the thing had been more clear, ſince aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
Chriſt ſpoke in the Syrian, Thou art the Rock, and upon this
Rock I will build my Church. <hi>Where he expreſly affirms, that</hi>
Matthew <hi>the Evangeliſt (or at leaſt his</hi> Greek <hi>Interpreter, ſince
it is thought by ſome, that the Goſpel of</hi> Matthew <hi>was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
originally in</hi> Syriack) <hi>tranſlats the word of Chriſt unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
thus,</hi> Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my
Church: whereas he ſhould have tranſlated them, Thou art the
Rock, and upon this Rock I will build my Church. <hi>In affirming
which, he ſpeaks right-down blaſphemy, if</hi> Matthew <hi>penned
his Goſpel in</hi> Greek <hi>himſelf: and although that tranſlation were
not of</hi> Matthew <hi>himſelf, but of ſome other nevertheleſs he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
the whole primitive Church, and the ancient Church of</hi>
Rome <hi>among the reſt, for approving as authentick, a falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
in ſo ſubſtantial a point. That the</hi> Greek <hi>verſion</hi>
Matthews <hi>Goſpel was held authentick by the Primitive
Church, ſhal be demonſtrated,</hi> lib. 6.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon why <hi>Peter</hi> cannot be the Rock, is this, The
foundation, or rock upon which the Church militant and the
Church triumphant are built, are both one: &amp; conſequently <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
would be the foundation of the Church triumphant, if he
were the Rock upon which the Church is built. And ſince the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceeds to <hi>Peter,</hi> as they all averr, the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> is the foundation of the Church triumphant: which
aſſertion is ſo abſurd, that no Chriſtian ears can hear it
without deteſtation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64826:39"/>
Finally, if <hi>Peter</hi> be the Rock upon which the Church is
built, it would follow that <hi>Peter</hi> was Oecumenick Biſhop,
when Chriſt ſaid unto him, <hi>Tu es Petrus:</hi> The meaning of
Chriſt, ſay they, is, <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> or <hi>thou art the Rock:</hi> and
conſequently thou art Oecumenick Biſhop preſently: ſince our
Savior doth not ſay unto him, <hi>Tu eris Petra,</hi> or <hi>thou ſhalt be the
Rock</hi> or Oecumenick Biſhop. But if <hi>Peter</hi> had been the Rock,
or Oecumenick Biſhop at that time, the gates of hell would
have prevailed againſt him; which is expreſly againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of Chriſt, ſince <hi>Peter</hi> after that denied Chriſt thrice. And
thus we have diſputed, <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> by reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stapleton</hi> endeavors to prove by ſeveral reaſons, that <hi>Peter</hi> is
the Rock: which in effect are the ſame reaſons, clothed with
diverſity of words. The ſum of them is this, It appears, ſaith
he, by all the circumſtances, that ſome ſingular thing or other
was given to <hi>Peter</hi> in thoſe words; for <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered only,
<hi>Thou art the Son of the living God.</hi> Secondly, Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
him bleſſed. Thirdly, Chriſt affirmed he had that
ſecret only by revelation from God. Laſtly, Chriſt pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thoſe words to him as a reward, <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon
this Rock I will build my Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is anſwered, It was a ſufficient reward for</hi> Peter, <hi>that he
was called</hi> Petrus, <hi>from</hi> Petra, <hi>the Rock, which was Chriſt. It
had been too high a reward for</hi> Peter, <hi>to obtain that which was
proper to Chriſt; this is the opinon of all the Fathers, as</hi> Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
de Trinitate, Petrus, quia habebat ſocietatem fidei, cum
Domino habuit etiam unitatem nominis Dominici: ut ſicut à
Chriſto Chriſtianus dicitur, ita à Petrâ Chriſto, Petrus Apoſtolus
vocaretur. Peter, becauſe he had ſociety of faith, with the Lord
he was called Peter from Petra, as a Chriſtian is called after
Chriſt. Auguſtinus, Sermon. 13. De verbis Domini ſecundum
Matthaeum. Deinde addidit, Et ego dicotibi: tanquam diecret. Quiae
tu mihi dixiſti, Tu es Chriſtus Filius Dei vivi, &amp; ego dico tibi,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64826:39"/>
Tu es Petrus; <hi>that is, Thou ſhalt be called</hi> Peter, becauſe of thy
confeſſing me to be the Son of God. <hi>Other teſtimonies might be
heaped, but it is to no purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Stapleton <hi>inſiſts, that it was not the name only, which</hi> Peter
<hi>got as a reward, but ſome thing beſide, proper to himſelf,</hi> viz.
<hi>to be the Rock, upon which the Church is built: which he
proves by the authority of</hi> Chryſoſtom, <hi>whoſe words are cited
by him thus,</hi> Quoddam hic eſſe Filii donum proprium Petro da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
ſicut Patris quoddam donum erat eidem conceſſum: Pater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
revelavit Petro Christum eſſe Filium Dei vivi; Filius tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit
Petro ut ſit Eccleſiae Petra, <hi>that is,</hi> Some proper gift was
given to <hi>Peter</hi> here by Chriſt, as the Father had given unto him
ſuch a gift: the Father revealed to <hi>Peter</hi> that Chriſt was the Son
of the living God; So the Son gives unto <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Rock of
the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is anſwered,</hi> Stapleton <hi>cites</hi> Chryſoſtom <hi>falſly; his words
in the Original are,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
<hi>that is,</hi> What is it and I will
give it to thee? as the Father gave unto thee to know me, ſo I will
give unto thee. Neither ſaid he, I will aſk of my Father, although
it was a great oſtentation of his power, and the greatneſs of
the gift ineffable: Nevertheleſs, I will give unto
thee. What wilt thou give, pray? the Keys of the Kingdom of
Heaven.</p>
               <p>By which it appears that <hi>Stapleton</hi> plays the Sophiſter thrice.
Firſt in making <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> affirm, that ſome proper or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
thing was given to <hi>Peter,</hi> whereas <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> mentions no
ſuch thing at all. Secondly, he makes <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> affirm, that
the gift given to <hi>Peter</hi> was to be the Rock upon which the
Church is built; whereas <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith no ſuch thing, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
only that the gift given to <hi>Peter</hi> was the Keys of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64826:40"/>
Kingdom of Heaven: but it ſhal be proved by the teſtimony
of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> himſelf, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. That the keys of the Kingdom of
Heaven were given to others as well as to <hi>Peter.</hi> Thirdly, he
neglects the compariſon which <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> makes, (leaving out
now where he added before) viz. <hi>As the Father gave unto thee
to know me, ſo I give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of heaven,</hi>
The reaſon wherefore he neglects the compariſon, is evident,
<hi>viz</hi> he was conſcious, that the knowledge of Chriſt (the gift
of the Father to <hi>Peter</hi>) was common to all the Apoſtles; and
therefore he feared the concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven (the gift given by Chriſt to <hi>Peter</hi>) would
be common to all the Apoſtles alſo.</p>
               <p>And thus much of <hi>Stapletons</hi> reaſons, proving <hi>Peter</hi> to be
the Rock. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> reaſons thus, The pronoun <hi>hanc, this,</hi> is
referred to the words immediatly going before, <hi>Thou art Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
and therefore our Savior by this Rock means <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, There is no neceſſity of referring the
pronoun <hi>hanc,</hi> or <hi>this,</hi> to the words immediatly going before,
as appears by ſeveral places of Scripture, as <hi>Acts 3. 15. And
killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raiſed from the dead, of
whom we are witneſſes;</hi> where thoſe words <hi>of whom,</hi> are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the <hi>Prince of life,</hi> and not unto God who is neareſt.
That the pronoun <hi>hunc</hi> or <hi>him,</hi> or <hi>this,</hi> is of neceſsity referred
to the words fatrher off and not to the neareſt, appears alſo
by <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 22. and 23. and 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. moſt clearly v. 8.
<hi>And then ſhall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall
conſume, whoſe comming is after the working of Satan, with all
power and ſigns, and lying wonders:</hi> obſerve, <hi>whoſe coming</hi>
is referred not to <hi>the Lord,</hi> which is neareſt, but to
that <hi>wicked one</hi> further off. And thus we have diſputed all
the reaſons of any moment pretended by either party in this
queſtion, it <hi>Peter</hi> was the Rock?</p>

               <p>Secondly, it is very ſtrange impudence to them, to alledge
the authority of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> to prove the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of <hi>Peter,</hi> or of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of his
ſucceſsion to <hi>Peter,</hi> as appears by what follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aetius</hi> Legate of the Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaids
<hi>Paſchaſinus, Lucentius,</hi> and <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> Deputies of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> pleaded in the behalf of their Maſters the
Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for the primacy: <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſinus</hi>
and his fellows pleaded the ſixth canon of the Council
of <hi>Nice.</hi> The words are thoſe, <hi>Let the old cuſtom remain in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
Libya, Pentapolis,</hi> viz. <hi>that the Biſhop of Alexandria hath
power in thoſe Provinces (to ordain Biſhops) ſince the Biſhops of
Rome hath the like cuſtome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aetius</hi> pleaded the ſame Canon, and likewiſe the fifth Canon
of the ſaid Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> by which it was ordained, <hi>That
when a Biſhop was condemned by a provincial Council, there ſhould
be no further appeal, unleſs to a General Council:</hi> which excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though not mentioned in the Canon, muſt of neceſsity
be underſtood. The ſaid <hi>Aetius</hi> likewiſe pleaded the third Canon
of the ſecond General Council of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> by which it
was provided, <hi>That the Biſhop of Rome ſhould have the firſt
place in dignity, becauſe Rome was the old Imperial City; the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Conſtantinople the ſecond place next to him, becauſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople
was new Rome.</hi> The force of this argument conſiſts
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64826:41"/>
in two things. Firſt, that the ſaid ſecond General Council of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ordained the Juriſdiction of the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to be equal, although they gave the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> the firſt place in dignity. The ſecond thing is,
That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had the firſt place in dignity, not by
reaſon of his ſucceſſion to <hi>Peter,</hi> but for a civil reſpect; <hi>viz.</hi>
becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was the old Imperial City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paſchaſinus</hi> and his fellows replyed, (or at leaſt <hi>Bellarmin,</hi>
and <hi>Baronius</hi> would have ſo replyed, if they had been pleaders
before the Council) That the third Canon of the Council of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was not to be regarded; becauſe the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> had never approved it; and therefore they urged the
ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> by which (ſay they) the
Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had authority confirmed to him in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
becauſe the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had the like cuſtom. From
which they argued thus, That the authority of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> was the cauſe of the authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Alexand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi>
or, the authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> flowed
from the authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> And ſince the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was before him of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of old,
the ſaid ſecond General Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> wronged
the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in preferring the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
to him. In a word, the ſum of their pleading was this,
That, by the ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> had authority over him of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> And ſince the
Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was before the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
in former times, that third Act of the ſecond General Council
of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ought to be caſſed, and antiquitated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe
it contradicted the ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to him of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and
equalizing him to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aetius,</hi> and the Deputies of the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
duplyed; Firſt, That the ſaid Canon of the ſecond General
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64826:42"/>
Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ought not to be recalled (or at leaſt
Proteſtants would have ſo duplyed, if they had been in their
place;) Firſt, Becauſe it was a lawful General Council; And
although the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had not confirmed it, becauſe he
had no authority above a General Council; It was very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
that any particular Biſhop ſhould cut and carve for his
own advantage, againſt the decree of the whole Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſaid General Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was
received and confirmed by a Synod at <hi>Rome</hi> two years after, the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome Dammaſus</hi> preſiding in the ſaid Council. And
therefore it was falſe that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> never confirmed
the ſaid Council of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> gave no
authority to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over the Biſhop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria;</hi>
the meaning of the Canon being only this, <hi>viz.</hi> The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of the Canon was one <hi>Miletius</hi> troubled all <hi>Egypt</hi> by
ordaining Biſhops at his own hand. <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi>
complains to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which upon his
complaint, made the foreſaid ſixth Canon. The true Gloſs of
which being, that the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſhould have the
power of ordaining Biſhops in <hi>Egypt, Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> as
he was wont; Since the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had the like power by
cuſtom, in the places adjacent to <hi>Rome;</hi> or, (as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who lived near theſe times, interprets) <hi>in Eccleſijs Suburbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carijs,</hi>
that is, in Churches within a hundred miles to the walls
of <hi>Rome.</hi> So then, the authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was not
the cauſe of the authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or the
Original from whence it flowed; but only a pattern, according
to which it was framed: as one common-wealth may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in government according to the pattern of another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
without any ſubordination in authority.</p>
               <p>They duplyed fourthly, That the ſaid General Council of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did no wrong to the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64826:42"/>
giving to the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the ſecond place in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
which before that time, belonged to the Biſhop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
ſince the cauſe ceaſing, the effect alſo ceaſed. The cauſe
why the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was ſecond to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> was this, viz. The government of <hi>Egypt</hi> was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
government in dignity, to the government of the City
of <hi>Rome:</hi> It was ſo ordained by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and therefore, was
called <hi>Praefectura Auguſtalis.</hi> Since it was not ſo now, becauſe
the government of thoſe Provinces depending on the City of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was made the ſecond Government and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to that of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and made equal to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thoſe places, depending upon the city of <hi>Rome;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſaid council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did no wrong in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualizing
the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to the Biſhop <hi>Rome:</hi>
ſince the civil Government was a Type of the Eccleſiaſtick,
as is confeſſed by <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf, <hi>ad Annum 39. Num.</hi> 10.
That the Government, and Priviledges of the City of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
being made equal to thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> was the cauſe
why the council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> made the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
equal in Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome:</hi> is reported both by <hi>Socrates, hiſt. lib. 5. chap.</hi> 8.
and <hi>Sozomenus lib. 7. chap.</hi> 9. Who both give the reaſon
of the ſaid third Canon (in the Greek Edition, but 5. or 7. in
the Latine) to be, <hi>Becauſe that Conſtantinople, had not only
the name of</hi> Rome, <hi>with like Senat and other Magiſtrats, but
bare alſo the ſame Arms and other rights, and honors which
belonged to old</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> having conſidered the reaſons of
both parties, allowed the interpretation put upon the ſixth
Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> by the Orators of the Biſhop
of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> rejected that Gloſs of thoſe of the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome;</hi> confirmed the third Canon of the ſecond General
Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with ſome advantage, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64826:43"/>
addition, as by the 28 Canon, whoſe words are theſe; <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

extollendam, Sic tamen ut poſt eam ſecundum locum obtineat.</hi>
By which Canon two things appears, Firſt, that the Biſhop
of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is expreſly made equal in Eccleſiaſtick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> hath the firſt place in dignity, not by reaſon of
ſucceſſion to <hi>Peter;</hi> but only for civil reſpects; viz. becauſe
<hi>Rome</hi> was the old imperial City. It appears alſo by the ſaid
Canon, that the former General Councils of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
gave the primacy to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the
ſame reaſon only; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it was the old imperial City.
And therefore it is intollerable impudence in our adverſaries
to object the authority of the Council of <hi>Chalcedo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> to prove
the Supremacy of <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which it appears the impudence of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi>
who abuſe their Reader with ſtrange Sophiſtry, and
moſt ſhameleſs. The Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> ſay they, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
the ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> For immediatly after the reading
of the ſaid Canon, the beginning of which was, <hi>Eccleſia Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana
ſemper habuit primatum, the Church of Rome evermore
had the primacy,</hi> The Canon being thus read, all the Council
cryed out, <hi>Perpendimus omnem primatum &amp; honorem praecipuum
ſecundum Canones, antiquae Romae Deo amantiſsimo Archiepiſcopo
conſervari.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:64826:43"/>
But it is anſwered; firſt, Thoſe words of the Canon, <hi>viz.
the Church of Rome ever had the primacy;</hi> are forged, being
found in no other copie, but in that of <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus:</hi>
but his authority is not ſufficient to out balance all other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of the Canons of the Council, both Greek and Latin; yea,
that copie corrected by <hi>Gregory</hi> 13 himſelf, which wants thoſe
firſt words pretended by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Baronius:</hi> in which copie
and all other copies, the firſt words of the ſaid Canon are, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquus
mos perduret, &amp;c. Let the old custom remain in Egypt,
Libya,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, although the Canon had begun ſo, it makes not
much to the purpoſe; ſince it appears by the decree of the
Council, that the Primacy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was only
a Primacy of dignity; for civil reſpects, and not a Primacy of
Juriſdiction, by reaſon of the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> ſucceſsion to
<hi>Peter:</hi> as appears expreſly by the words of the Canon: And
alſo that the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was ordained by the ſaid
Council, equal in Juriſdiction to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> If <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
and <hi>Baronius</hi> affirm, that the words of the twenty-eight
Canon are miſ-interpreted, their mouths are ſtopped,
not only by the carriage of <hi>Lucentius,</hi> and other two Legats
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo by the carriage of <hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>The carriage of <hi>Lucentius</hi> was this, When the Fathers of
the Council had ſubſcribed the ſaid twenty eight Canon,
<hi>Lucentius</hi> ſtood up, crying, foul play: <hi>Some of thoſe ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were compelled ſo to do, by one indirect way or other:</hi>
The whole Fathers of the Council anſwered, they had delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly,
and voluntarily ſubſcribed. Whereupon <hi>Lucentius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
againſt the Council, as having preferred the judgement
of a hundred and fifty Fathers of the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
before the judgement of three hundred and eighteen Fathers,
in the firſt general Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> which was as much to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64826:44"/>
ſay, as he underſtood the meaning of the ſixth Canon of the
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> better then thoſe ſix hundred and thirty
Fathers of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> repreſenting the whole
Church, This carraige of <hi>Lucentius</hi> is recorded in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Chalcedon, Act.</hi> 16. pag. 936. 937. 938.</p>
               <p>Next, that the ſaid Council decerned againſt the ſupremacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> appears by four Epiſtles of <hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf; in which he thunders againſt the Council of
<hi>Chalcedon</hi> for making the foreſaid 28. Canon; ſtill ingemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> or that they had wronged the ſupremacy
of <hi>Peter;</hi> by which complaints of his it is moſt evident, that
thoſe 630. Fathers, repreſenting the whole Church in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council, meant nothing leſſe then the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter,</hi>
in theſe words, <hi>Tu es Petrus.</hi> Theſe four Epiſtles of <hi>Leo</hi> are
his 52. Epiſtle to <hi>Anatolius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> His 54.
to <hi>Martianus</hi> the Emperour, his 55. to <hi>Pulcheria</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs;
his 62. to <hi>Maximus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch;</hi> in which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles
he complains heavily, that the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
was preferred to him of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
was the ſeat of the Emperor, he fore-ſaw (being a man of great
Spirit and foreſight) that in the end, for the ſame reaſon, the
Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> would be preferred to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome;</hi> which accordingly fell out, as ſhal be proved, <hi>lib</hi> 4.
And thus it appeareth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with how little integrity our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
object the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> to prove that <hi>Peter</hi> was
the Rock, meaned by our Savior in theſe words, <hi>Tu es Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus,</hi>
&amp;c. By which proceedings of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
appears alſo, what was the opinion of the general councils of
<hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the ſixth general Council, commonly called <hi>Trulla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
celebrated under <hi>Pogonatus</hi> the Emperor; <hi>Anno</hi> 680. in
its 36. Canon, it confirms the 28. Canon of the Council of
<hi>Chalcedon totidem verbis;</hi> By which it appears what was the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64826:44"/>
opinion of the Church concerning <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> in the end of
the 7. age. And ſo we have the opinion of the firſt, ſecond,
fourth, and ſixth general Councils, that <hi>Peter</hi> is not the Rock
upon which the Church is built.</p>
               <p>As for the third general council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the fifth of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> although in expreſs words, they make not all
the Patriarchs of alike Juriſdiction; Yet they made Canons
expreſly contradicting the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and conſequently, contradicting alſo <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Rock
upon which the Church is built. The council of <hi>Epheſus</hi>
calls <hi>Celeſtine</hi> Biſhop <hi>Rome</hi> Fellow-Miniſter. It were a bold
thing now in any Biſhop to ſalute the <hi>Pope</hi> ſo. Secondly,
they depoſed <hi>John</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> before ever they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>Celeſtine</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears by the Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Epiſtle, <hi>Binius Tom. 1. page</hi> 806. Thirdly, they ordained
that neither the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> nor any other Biſhop
(<hi>ergo</hi> not the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>) ſhould take upon him to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
Biſhops in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus, Binius Tom. 26. pag.</hi> 768.</p>
               <p>As for the fifth general council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
the cauſe of <hi>Anthimius,</hi> after he had firſt been judged
by <hi>Aggapetus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome; Binius</hi> in his notes upon that
council, <hi>Tom 2. pag</hi> 416. Secondly, it condemned <hi>Vigilius</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet in the end the ſaid <hi>Vigilius</hi> approved
the ſaid council: <hi>Baronius,</hi> Anno 553. <hi>Binius</hi> in the place
fore-mentioned. And thus ye have the opinion of the ſix
firſt general councils, concerning the Supremacy of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of his ſucceſſion to <hi>Peter,</hi> in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
of the Church: By which paſſages it appears that
the ſixth firſt general councils meaned nothing leſſe, then
that <hi>Peter</hi> was the Rock, upon which the Church was built;
or that <hi>Peter</hi> was ordained Monarch of the Church, in thoſe
words, <hi>Tu es Petrus.</hi> It ſhal likewiſe be proved, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. That
the ſeventh general council, <hi>Anno</hi> 790. and the 8. <hi>Anno</hi> 870.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64826:45"/>
had as little regard to the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
The firſt of which condemned Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> as an Heretick
and the laſt approved of it.</p>
               <p>And thus we have the opinion of the whole Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Tu en Petrus,</hi> the firſt 900. year after Chriſt: all
which time, it was no article of Faith, (as appears by thoſe
eight general Councils) that <hi>Peter</hi> was ordained Monarch of
the Church, in thoſe words, <hi>Tu es Petrus.</hi> The truth is,
it was invented, Firſt, by <hi>Leo</hi> after the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
when the contention aroſe between the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for the Primacy: it was ſtill made uſe of by
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> after that, pleading for the Primacy;
but it appears by the 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for he expreſly thunders againſt one viſible head of
of the Church: amongſt other reaſons, he hath this for one,
<hi>Although Peter had the care of the whole Church, committed
into him yet was he not univerſal Apoſtle.</hi> And thus we have
reaſoned, <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> from Scripture, Reaſon, and General
Councils. Now let us hear the opinion of the Fathers.</p>

Petra enim principale nomen eſt: ideo Petrus à Petra, non Petra à

vocatur. Who before was called Simon, was after called Peter: Our
Savior calls him ſo, to ſignifie the Church by that figure: Becauſe
Chriſt is the Rock, Peter is the Chriſtian People, <hi>&amp;c. Other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
might be alledged out of</hi> Auguſtinus, <hi>but it is needleſs
to mention them, ſince it is confeſſed by our adverſaries, that</hi>
Auguſtinus <hi>interprets the Rock to be Chriſt becauſe he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the Syriack tongue; As if thoſe other Fathers, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
Hieronymus, <hi>moſt skilful of the Oriental Languages,
were ignorant alſo of the Syriack tongue. And thus much of
thoſe Fathers interpreting the Rock to be Chriſt, by which it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64826:46"/>
appears, how impudent an aſſertion it was of</hi> Bozius, Ianſeuius,
De Valentie, Agricola, Stapleton, <hi>and others, affirming all the
Fathers</hi> (Auguſtinus <hi>only excepted) unanimouſly interprets the</hi>
Rock <hi>to be</hi> Peter.</p>
               <p>The falſhood of their aſſertion being diſcovered, they fall
next to Sophiſtry to defend their lying: And firſt, they fall
upon <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> taxing him of ignorance of the Syriack
tongue, for interpreting the <hi>Rock</hi> to be Chriſt, But it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
Firſt, the teſtimonies of thoſe other Fathers denying
<hi>Peter</hi> to be the Rock, eſpecially of <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> are no leſſe
evident, then the teſtimonies of <hi>Auguſtinus,:</hi> But it were
impudence in them, to object ignorance of the Syriack tongue
to <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> who was known to be moſt skilful in it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
their Sophiſtry is very great, they object ignorance to
<hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> of the Syrian tongue, for denying the <hi>Rock</hi> to be
<hi>Peter,</hi> following the penner of <hi>Matthew</hi> in Greek; whoſe verſion
was followed by the whole Church as authentick: &amp; defends the
ignorance of ſuppoſititious Authors, ſuch as <hi>Anacletus, Optatus,
Melevitanus, Iſidorus</hi> &amp; ſuch like, who interpret <hi>Cephas</hi> (which
ſignifyeth a great ſtone in the Syrian tongue (a <hi>head</hi> to prove
the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter</hi> becauſe of the affinity it hath in its ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Letters, with the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Cephale or head. So
<hi>Turrianus</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> Anno 31. defends thoſe ignorants, <hi>viz.</hi>
Becauſe it makes for the Popes ſupremacy, and blames
<hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> as ignorant, for no other reaſon, then becauſe his
interpretation croſſeth it.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe other Fathers beſide <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> ſome of them
taxeth them alſo of ignorance ſo <hi>Stapleton, Salmero, Cumerus,
Maldonatus;</hi> Let us hear their reaſons.</p>
               <p>Their firſt is, Theſe words, <hi>ſuper hanc Petram,</hi> anſwers
to the former words, <hi>Tu es Petrus:</hi> But it is anſwered thoſe
words, <hi>Super hanc Petram,</hi> anſwer alſo to thoſe words, <hi>Thou art
Chriſt the Son of the living God:</hi> For there is no neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64826:47"/>
the pronoun <hi>hanc,</hi> to the words immediatly going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which is proved by other paſſages of ſcripture; as <hi>Asts</hi> 2. 23
where the proun <hi>hunc</hi> is referred not to God which is neareſt, but
to <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth</hi> farther off. And alſo in this Chapter, by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of Fathers of more authority, and leſſe ſuſpect in this
particular, then <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Maldonat:</hi> and it ſhall be proved
further in the following chapters not only by teſtimonies of
moſt eminent Fathers, and Popiſh Doctors, but alſo by the
teſtimonies of five <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond reaſon is, Chriſt in theſe words, gives
ſome reward or other to <hi>Peter</hi> for his confeſſion: but it is
anſwered, <hi>Peter</hi> is rewarded, when he is called <hi>Petrus</hi> from
<hi>Petra,</hi> or Chriſt the Rock. Secondly, when he gets the
Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, whence <hi>Chryſoſtom, As
the Father gave unto thee to know me, ſo I give unto thee
the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third reaſon is, That Chriſt in theſe words, <hi>ſuper
hanc-Petram,</hi> means not the principal <hi>Rock,</hi> or proper,
<hi>viz.</hi> himſelf; but only a Metaphorick, or Miniſterial <hi>Rock,</hi>
and conſequently the <hi>Rock</hi> muſt be <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered the eſtate of the queſtion is, whether
Chriſt, that is the principal <hi>Rock,</hi> be underſtood by <hi>ſuper
hanc Petrum? Stapleton</hi> proves not, becauſe, ſaith he,
Chriſt is not meaned which he proves by his own naked aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
without any other reaſon: which is a childiſh <hi>peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
principij.</hi> However we will add a reaſon that his aſſertion
is falſe; for if a Miniſterial <hi>Rock</hi> be underſtood, in theſe
words, <hi>ſuper hanc Petrum; Stapleton</hi> is hard put to it, to
prove out of theſe words, the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which is his main intention: Since it ſhal appear, <hi>cap</hi> 6.
that all the Apoſtles are <hi>Miniſterial Rocks;</hi> and that by the
teſtimonies of the Fathers, interpreting the Rock to be <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their fourth reaſon is, The words of our Savior are,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64826:47"/>
                  <hi>aedificabo Eccl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſiam meam ſuper hanc Petram,</hi> Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
as much, as the Church was not already built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Rock; but only to be built upon it afterwards:
and therefore our Savior by <hi>Hanc Petram,</hi> cannot mean
himſelf upon whom the Church was already built. But it is
anſwered, This is nothing but ſophiſtry, becauſe already the
Church was only built upon Chriſt in <hi>Jude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
is propheſying here, that the Gopel ſhal be propagated
throughout the whole world, and the Church built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himſelf. It is childiſh reaſoning to argue the Church is
built upon Chriſt already, <hi>Ergo</hi> it cannot be ſaid, it ſhall
be built upon him in time to come; it is all one as one would
reaſon thus, <hi>Matthew</hi> 1. it is affirmed, <hi>He ſhal ſave his people.
Ergo he hath not ſaved them;</hi> and conſequently, it is no leſs
fooliſh to affirm the Church is already built upon Chriſt,
becauſe he promiſeth to build it upon himſelf in time to come.</p>
               <p>Their fifth reaſon is, Chriſt promiſeth to build the Churh
upon one or other beſides himſelf; ſince he cannot be ſaid to
build the Church upon himſelf: for it is the Father <hi>qui dedit
ipſum caput ſuper omnem Eccleſiam,</hi> as the Apoſtle affirms, But
it is anſwered, That aſſertion of <hi>Stapletons</hi> contradicts <hi>Auguſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
affirming, <hi>ſuper me ipſum filium Dei vivi aedificabo Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam.</hi>
Which is his gloſs upon theſe words, <hi>ſuper hanc Petram.</hi>
Secondly, It contradicts <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> affirming, <hi>in ſe jam aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaverat
Apoſtolos, &amp; Diſcipulos multos, He had already
built upon himſelf many Apoſtles and Diſciples.</hi> Thirdly, It
contradicts Scripture, <hi>Epheſians 4. 16. By whom all the body
being coupled and knit together, &amp;c. receiveth increaſe of the
body, unto the edifying of it ſelf in love.</hi> By which words
compared with verſe 15. follows that the Church is built
upon Chriſt by himſelf.</p>
               <p>Their ſixth reaſon is, If by <hi>hanc Petram</hi> be meant Chriſt,
we cannot know which is the true Church, and which is the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64826:48"/>
falſe? and therefore of neceſſity by <hi>hanc Petram,</hi> Peter muſt
be meaned.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, The Fathers we now mentioned, and
ſhal mention in the following chapter, knew very well how to
diſcern the true Church by the falſe; &amp; yet none of them do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
<hi>Peter</hi> to be the Rock, upon which the Church is
built, eſpecially, <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> who diſputing againſt the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi>
cites many paſſages of Scripture, by which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
to diſcern the true Church by the falſe, and yet he
never makes uſe of this place, <hi>Tu es Petrus.</hi> Which he would
not have omitted, if the mentioning of it had been ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar,
to diſcern the true Church from the falſe: or if the
true Church could not be diſcerned from the falſe without it.
Secondly, This reaſon is a childiſh, if not blaſphemous,
<hi>petitio principij:</hi> As if none could ſhow the true Church by
the falſe, except the ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> upon whom in their
opinion the Church is built: and ſo that is only the true
Church, which acknowledgeth the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be
head of the Church; as ſucceſſor to <hi>Peter</hi> in the Monarchy of
the Church. And thus much of thoſe Fathers interpreting
the Rock to be Chriſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin and Stapleton</hi> anſwers more modeſtly, to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

Which opinion they affirm to be all one with their own, <hi>viz.</hi>
that <hi>Peter</hi> is the Rock.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, This gloſs or diſtinction is far beſide the
meaning of thoſe Fathers, who interpret the <hi>Faith or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion
of Peter to be the Rock,</hi> as thing differing from <hi>Peter</hi>
himſelf. So <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his <hi>Homile</hi> on <hi>Matthew 55. 5.
Super hanc Petram dixit, &amp; non ſuper hunc Petrum. Non enim
ſuper hominem, ſed ſuper fidem, aedificabit Eccleſiam.</hi> Which
words he hath alſo in his Sermon upon Penticoſt, in which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64826:49"/>
he quite overthrows the diſtinction of <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi>
averring only the confeſſion of <hi>Peter,</hi> and not at all
<hi>Peter</hi> himſelf to be the Rock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in his 13. Sermon, <hi>de verb. Dom ſecundum Mac.</hi>

expreſly diſtinguiſh the Rock from <hi>Peter,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cannot mean that <hi>Peter</hi> is the Rock.</p>
               <p>It may be alſo proved by reaſon, that in the opinion of
thoſe Fathers, <hi>Peter</hi> cannot be the Rock at all: that is, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus
credens,</hi> or <hi>Peter believing.</hi> We will only mention three
reaſons; Firſt, The Rock upon which the Church is built
is perpetual, becauſe a perpetual building requires a perpetual
foundation; but <hi>Peter</hi> is no perpetual foundation, ſince
he dyed, and was removed a little after that promiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The thing which <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed, whether it be
taken formally for the Act of Confeſſion, or objectively, for
the thing confeſſed; cannot be <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, ſince both thoſe
propoſitions are falſe. <hi>The Confeſsion of</hi> Peter, <hi>is</hi> Peter; <hi>and
the thing confeſſed by</hi> Peter, <hi>is</hi> Peter: but thoſe Fathers in the
former chapter affirm, that the Rock was the thing confeſſed
by <hi>Peter</hi> and the Fathers of this chapter: that it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of <hi>Peter:</hi> (the meaning of both Fathers is the ſame, as
we proved in <hi>Nyſſenus,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtinus</hi>) Ergo neither of thoſe
Fathers, whether they interpret the Rock to be the thing
confeſſed by <hi>Peter,</hi> or the confeſſion of <hi>Beter,</hi> can mean that
<hi>Peter</hi> is the Rock himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Suppoſe that ſome believed in Chriſt, in the dayes
of our Savior, who never heard ſo much as the name of <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
It cannot be denyed but thoſe perſons were built upon
the Rock: But it cannot be affirmed that they were built
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64826:50"/>
upon <hi>Peter,</hi> ſince they never ſo much as heard of his name.</p>

<hi>Sophiſtries,</hi> that the Faith, or Confeſſion of <hi>Peter</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the Rock upon which the Church is built; becauſe (ſay
they) the houſe and the Foundation moſt be <hi>Homogeneous:</hi>
the Church is compoſed of <hi>Men,</hi> but the Confeſſion, and
Faith of <hi>Peter</hi> is a quality; but a quality cannot be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a houſe conſiſting of Men: or ſubſtances.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, Firſt, The <hi>Faith and confeſsion</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
may be conſidered two wayes. Firſt, <hi>Formally</hi> for the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Faith, or act of Confeſſion. Secondly, <hi>Objectively,</hi>
for the thing confeſſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, when thoſe Fathers call
the <hi>Faith, or Confeſsion of Peter the Rock,</hi> they take it <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively</hi>
for the thing confeſſed, or believed; for, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
thoſe Fathers who call Chriſt the Rock, and thoſe who
call the <hi>confeſsion</hi> of <hi>Peter the Rock,</hi> mean all one thing; Since
thoſe who in one place call Chriſt the Rock, in another call
<hi>the confeſsion of Peter the Rock:</hi> So <hi>Nyſſenus</hi> and <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi>
as we ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We retort the Argument, reaſoning <hi>ex conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi>
Firſt, they confeſs that the Foundation of the Church,
muſt be <hi>Homogeneous</hi> to the Church it ſelf. So <hi>Pighius</hi> and
<hi>Bellarmin.</hi> Secondly, they grant that no Faith is <hi>Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
to the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So <hi>Pighius</hi> expreſly affirms that Faith and
the Church, <hi>differunt toto genere:</hi> from thoſe premiſſes, no

Ergo,</hi> no Faith can be the foundation of the Church. Which
concluſion expreſly contradicts the third Seſſion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent,</hi> aſſerting <hi>the Symbole of Faith to be the only and

               <p>VVHen <hi>Bozius,</hi> and others of the Doctors of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> objected that all the Fathers,
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> interpreted the Rock to be

<hi>the confeſsion of Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was anſwered, Secondly, That the meaning of thoſe
Fathers, calling the <hi>Rock Peter,</hi> was nothing leſs, then that
<hi>Peter</hi> in thoſe words of <hi>Chriſt, thou art Peter and upon this

Whoſe teſtimonies you may find in <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who

                  </hi>
The reaſons, wherefore thoſe Fathers (although they call the
Rock <hi>Peter</hi>) do not affirm he was ordained Oecumenick
Biſhop, are thoſe following. The firſt is,</p>
               <p>Thoſe Fathers could have no other opinion of the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of <hi>Peter,</hi> then that of the
whole Church: But the whole Church in their times was
againſt the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter,</hi> or the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> For
it ſhall be proved <hi>lib.</hi> 3. that the firſt; ſecond, and third Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

and the ſixth, ſeventh, and eight General Councils <hi>lib.</hi> 5.
which was hinted at above, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Many of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> teſtimonies are forged,
as ſhal be proved, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. and 3. As the Epiſtle of <hi>Clement</hi> to
<hi>Iames,</hi> of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to <hi>Felix</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

                     </gap>
                  </hi>
of ignorance of the <hi>Syriack</hi> tongue, for interpreting
the Rock to be Chriſt: unanimouſly confeſſing he denyeth
the Rock to be <hi>Peter.</hi> It is needleſs to ſet down the reaſons
by which learned Men, both <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> prove
thoſe <hi>Sermons de ſanctis</hi> attributed to <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Many of thoſe Fathers who interpret the Rock
to be <hi>Peter,</hi> interpret it alſo to be Chriſt, <hi>or the Confeſsion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64826:51"/>
of Peter,</hi> as <hi>Tertullianus, Hilarius, Ambrosius, Hieronymus,
Chryſoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

contradict themſelves, their meaning is all one, and it ſhal
be immediatly ſhewed nothing leſs then the Supremacy of
<hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The reaſons wherefore thoſe Fathers interpret
the Rock to be <hi>Peter,</hi> inferr no wayes that he was Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick
Biſhop; but on the contrair, demonſtrat that he was
not Oecumenick Biſhop: Since in their opinion others may
be called Rocks, as well as <hi>Peter, viz. Nazianzeus</hi> in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
for moderation affirms, <hi>Petrus Petra vocatur, quia
Eccleſiae fundamenta ſuae fidei credita habet.</hi> That is, <hi>Peter was
called the Rock, becauſe he had the foundations of the Church
concredited to his Faith, Ambroſius; Sermon 47. Becauſe he
layed firſt the foundations of Faith amongſt the nations, therefore
Peter was called the Rock. Theophylactus</hi> affirms, <hi>he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Rock, becauſe of his Faith and Confeſsion that Chriſt
was the Son of God. Epiphanius, Becauſe he founded the Faith
of our Lord, upon which the Church is built, he was made a
ſolid Rock unto us. Haeres in Catharis. Theophanes Ceraneus,</hi>
As he is cited by <hi>Salmero, tom. 4. part. 3. tract.</hi> 2. affirms,
<hi>That Peter was called the Rock, becauſe of his Confeſsion:</hi> by
which it appears that the reaſons, wherefore <hi>Peter</hi> was called
the Rock, are two: Firſt, becauſe he founded Churches.
Secondly, becauſe he confeſſed Chriſt: Neither of which
inferr an Oecumenick Biſhop: ſince no Sophiſter never ſo
impudent can deny, that others as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> founded
Churches and confeſſed Chriſt: neither is it of any moment
what they object, that <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt that founded
the Church and confeſſed Chriſt: as <hi>Theophylactus</hi> ſeems to
import; ſince it ſhal be proved afterward, that the Apoſtles
before this confeſsion of <hi>Peter,</hi> confeſſed <hi>Chriſt to be Son of God,
Matthew</hi> 14. and <hi>John 6. or the great Prophet;</hi> ſee alſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64826:52"/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 42. and 43. and 2. 30. 31. 32. Secondly, Albeit
<hi>Peter</hi> had firſt confeſſed Chriſt, and by that confeſsion firſt
founded the Church; it argues no ſupremacy in <hi>Peter,</hi> or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
over the Church, no more then it followeth that
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath Juriſdiction over Logicians, becauſe he taught
Logick firſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and mainly, becauſe thoſe Fathers who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
<hi>Peter</hi> to be the Rock, call others beſide <hi>Peter</hi> in the
ſame ſenſe, <hi>Rocks;</hi> whence it is evinced unanſwerably, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
nothing leſs then the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter;</hi> by that gloſs.
It were tedious to go through them all, we will only inſtance
ſome teſtimonies of thoſe Fathers, of whom our adverſaries
do moſt brag, by which will appear the meaning of the reſt.
The firſt is of <hi>Origines, trastat.</hi> 1. upon <hi>Matthew, Quod ſi
ſuper unum illum Petrum tantum exiſtimas aedificari totam Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam,
quid dicturus de Joanne filio tonitrui, &amp; Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum
unoquoque? quin aliqui num audebimus dicere, quod
adverſus Petrum unum non praevaliturae ſint portae inferorum,
adverſus autem caeteros Apoſtolos, ac praefectos praevaliturae
ſint? ac non potius in omnibus &amp; ſingulis eorum de quibus dictum
eſt, fit illud quod dictum est, &amp; portae inferorum uon praevalebunt
adverſus eam; item illud, ſuper hanc Petram aedificabo Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam
meam.</hi> No Father is more preſſed by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> then
<hi>Origen,</hi> to prove that <hi>Peter</hi> was the Rock: and here ye
have not only the teſtimony of <hi>Origin,</hi> that the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
were Rocks as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> but alſo his probation of
it. Firſt, he propones and ſtates the queſtion, Do ye think
(ſayeth he) that thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>upon this Rock I will
build my Church,</hi> are ſpoken only to <hi>Peter?</hi> you are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
what ſhal we then ſay of <hi>John</hi> the ſon of thunder?
So then the propoſition he undertakes to prove, is, that our
Savior promiſed to build his Church upon all the Apoſtles, as
Rocks: which he proves by this reaſon, becauſe it was ſaid to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64826:52"/>
all, the gates of hell ſhal not prevail againſt it: and a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the words now cited, he adds another reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe
the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven were given to all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
as well as to <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> anſwers, <hi>Origen</hi> in this place ſpeaks allegorically,
otherwiſe he would contradict himſelf in his 5. <hi>homily</hi> upon
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xodus;</hi> where he calls <hi>Peter</hi> a great Foundation, and moſt
ſolid <hi>Rock,</hi> upon whom the Church is built.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, there is no contradiction at all; for <hi>Peter</hi>
may be <hi>Magnum fundamentum &amp; ſolidiſsima Petra,</hi> and yet
not only the Foundation or Rock: for the ſtate of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not, Whether <hi>Peter</hi> was the foundation and Rock, upon
whom the Church was built? But whether he be the only
Foundation and Rock upon which the Church is built?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> inſtances, ſecondly, That this teſtimony of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
conſiſts not with the words of Chriſt, Becauſe they are
only ſpoken of <hi>Peter,</hi> and underſtood of him; <hi>Ergo,</hi> this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Origen</hi> muſt needs be allegorical. But it is anſwered,
Allthough the words of Chriſt were directed to <hi>Peter,</hi> yet
<hi>Origen</hi> not only affirms, but proves by two unanſwerable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that the promiſe was made to all, as well as <hi>Peter: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham,</hi> affirms he believed in <hi>God,</hi> and it
was imputed to him for righteouſneſs: and yet the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> applyes that to all the faithful, which is no <hi>Allegory,</hi> but
<hi>Tropology,</hi> by which a general promiſe belonging to all, is
directed to one. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhould take heed to reaſon thus;
<hi>The words were directed to Peter alone:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the promiſe was
made to him alone:</hi> For if this promiſe was made alone to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is quite deſtroyed;
ſince it was not made to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſucceſſors of
<hi>Peter,</hi> being only made to <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom the words were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmins</hi> third reaſon to prove the teſtimony of <hi>Origines</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:64826:53"/>
to be allegorical, is this: If all the Apoſtles be foundations,
or all the faithful, the whole Church would be foundation of
it ſelf, ſince there are no other beſides to be the walls and the
roof. But it is anſwered; Firſt, that the Church is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the faithful, becauſe it conſiſts of them; and ſo <hi>Lyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
on <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. affirms, <hi>That the Church doth not conſiſt
in men of power, and dignity, either Secular, or Eccleſiaſtick:
becauſe many Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>have been Apoſtats</hi> from the
faith; <hi>And therefore the Church conſiſts only of the faithful.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the Apoſtles are called foundations in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
becauſe they founded the Church by preaching that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
received from Chriſt, and ſealed it with their blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> objects laſtly <hi>ad homin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m,</hi> that Proteſtants affirm
that <hi>Peter</hi> cannot be the Rock, becauſe he is a meer man: but
ſaith he, that reaſon militats againſt any other mans being the
Rock. But it is anſwered, That Proteſtants deny any man to
be the Rock unleſs Chriſt, ſuſtaining alone the whole burthen
of the Church, as the Papiſts do of <hi>Peter:</hi> but they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other men to be the Rocks, in that ſenſe mentioned to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmins</hi>
third reaſon now mentioned. And thus much of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another of the Fathers, one of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> great confidence,
is <hi>Cyprianus;</hi> who in his 27. Epiſtle, after he hath mentioned
how Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, Thou art Peter, &amp;c. And I will give
u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>to thee the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> He deduceth
the Ordination of Biſhops from theſe words, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church: <hi>Ut Eccleſia ſuper Epiſcopos conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuatur,
&amp; omnis actus Eccleſiae per eoſdem praepoſitos gubernetur.</hi>
Here <hi>Pamelius</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth that <hi>Cyprian</hi> applyeth
that promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>Upon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi>
to every Biſhop, and conſequently when <hi>Cyprianus</hi> calls <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
the Rock; he cannot mean the only Rock, or that <hi>Peter</hi> is
Oecumenick Biſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:64826:53"/>
                  <hi>Pamelius</hi> anſwers, Albeit in this place <hi>Cyprianus</hi> applyeth
that promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>Upon this Rock I will build my Church</hi>
to all Biſhops; yet, Epiſt. 55. he applyeth it only to <hi>Peter.</hi>
But it is replyed, although it be true, that <hi>Cyprianus,</hi> Epiſt. 55:
makes mention only of <hi>Peter;</hi> yet it doth not follow he doth
apply it only to <hi>Peter:</hi> it is falſe that <hi>Cyprianus</hi> affirms, epiſt.
55. that it can be applyed to no other then <hi>Peter:</hi> ſince
himſelf in this place, epiſt. 27. applyeth it to every Apoſtle
or Biſhop.</p>
               <p>The third Father is <hi>Auguſtinus, Epiſt,</hi> 165. affirming, that
when Chriſt directed thoſe words to <hi>Peter, Peter</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Figure the whole Church: which he explains further,
tract. 124. upon <hi>John,</hi> where after a long diſput he concluds,
that the promiſe of Chriſt was made to the whole Church:
whereby it evidently appears, that <hi>Peter</hi> in thoſe words is not
ordained Oecumenick Biſhop, or the only Rock. In the
ſame ſenſe <hi>Hilarius,</hi> on <hi>Pſalm</hi> 67. calls all the Apoſtles <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations:</hi>
ſo <hi>Theodoretius</hi> and <hi>Remigius,</hi> on <hi>Pſalm</hi> 87. interpret
thoſe words, <hi>fundamenta ejus in montibus ſanctis,</hi> of all the
Apoſtles and Prophets: likewiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi>
2. 20. calleth all the Apoſtles and Prophets <hi>foundations</hi> and
<hi>Rocks.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſeems to call them <hi>Apocall.</hi> 21.
By which it is evident, that thoſe Fathers calling <hi>Peter Rock</hi>
or <hi>Foundation,</hi> attributs no peculiar thing to him; which is
not common to others: and conſequently they mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs by ſuch expreſſions, then that he is Oecumenick
Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Thoſe teſtimonies ſo evident, put <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to his wits end.
Let us hear and examine an admirable piece of Sophiſtry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin, lib. 1. cap. 11. De Pont. Rom.</hi> anſwers, that all
the Apoſtles may be called foundations three wayes. The firſt
is, becauſe they were the firſt who founded Churches every
where. The ſecond is, becauſe the Chriſtian Doctrine was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64826:54"/>
revealed to them all, by God. The third way is, by reaſon
of their governing the Church, they were all Heads Paſtors,
and Rectors of the Church: but in the firſt two wayes, all
the Apoſtles were alike with <hi>Peter,</hi> Foundations and Rocks of

                     </gap> I will build my
Church.</hi> The ſenſe of thoſe words conferring the Supremacy
upon <hi>Peter,</hi> depends upon this gloſs, put upon thoſe words
by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> which is both againſt Antiquity and Reaſon;
and therefore we may conclude that the truth of the Doctrine
of the Modern Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> depends upon the fantaſtick
gloſs of a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> contradicting all Antiquity, and inconſiſtent
with it ſelf. And firſt, it is againſt Antiquity, becauſe they
cannot give one inſtance from ancient Interpreters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Councils,
and Fathers, giving this gloſs upon thoſe words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior,
<hi>Upon this Rock I will build my Church:</hi> neither was this
gloſs ever heard of, or ſo much as dreamed of, before the
times of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> after the Supremacy of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> was openly aſſaulted. Secondly, this gloſs is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to it ſelf. By it <hi>Bellarmin</hi> intangles himſelf many ways:
and firſt, he grants that all the Apoſtles were equally Rocks
and Foundations with <hi>Peter,</hi> if the word <hi>Foundation</hi> be taken
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64826:54"/>
in the firſt two ſenſes. But all the Fathers who expone the
Apoſtles to be foundations, and <hi>Peter</hi> among the reſt, did
not ſo much as dream of any other way, why <hi>Peter</hi> or they are
called Foundations, but only of the firſt two, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard
that they all alike founded Churches, preaching that doctrine
revealed unto them all alike, immediatly from God: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<hi>foundation</hi> in <hi>Bellarmins</hi> third ſenſe is a dream of his
own, by which he may well confirm his diſciples, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
convert Proſelytes, but expoſe himſelf to the ludibrious
taxings of his adverſaries in making his own groundleſs fiction
the main <hi>Baſis</hi> of the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter;</hi> &amp; conſequently, of the
Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (and conſequently of the
Religion of the <hi>Modern</hi> Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> to which all muſt
be conform, under pain of damnation, according to that new
article coined by the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> adding to that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the <hi>Creed, Catholick Church,</hi> making it <hi>Catholick Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we have ſhewed, That this third way of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
is a fiction of <hi>Bellarmins,</hi> not dreamed of by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients;
which although it be ſufficient to refute it, yet it refutes
it ſelf by many contradictions: And firſt, of other Popiſh
Doctors: It gives unto all the Apoſtles <hi>plenitudinem po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatis,
plenitude of power,</hi> in which it contradicts the <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
Dictionary</hi> of <hi>Altenſtaing</hi> approved by authority of the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> In which Dictionar, <hi>Plenitudo poteſtatis,</hi> is
defined not only to be <hi>ordinis,</hi> but alſo, <hi>Juriſdictionis,</hi> conferred
by Chriſt only upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Succeſſors: and that now

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; ſubjective,</hi> it is only in the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi>
which is expreſly contradicted by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who attributs
it to all the Apoſtles, preſſed by the evident teſtimonies of
thoſe Fathers, ſeeing the gloſs of that Dictionar to be againſt
all Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though <hi>Bellarmin</hi> be more ſound then the gloſs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64826:55"/>
of that Dictionar; in attributing to all the Apoſtles that ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

of power; yet he contradicts himſelf, in giving to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
a greater power then they had it fleeth the edge of the
quickeſt reaſon, to conceive any power greater then <hi>plenitude
of power:</hi> and therefore it is a flat contradiction to affirme
that although all the Apoſtles have <hi>plenitude of power,</hi> yet
they depend upon <hi>Peter,</hi> as their <hi>head:</hi> which is as much to ſay,
as all the Apoſtles have that power, then which none can have a
greater: and yet <hi>Peter</hi> hath a greater power then they.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms that <hi>Peter</hi> hath <hi>plenitude</hi> of <hi>power,</hi>
as ordinar Paſtor; the other Apoſtles as extraordinar and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats
to <hi>Peter:</hi> in which he intangles himſelf in a twofold
contradiction. For to omit that diſtinction of ordinar and
extraordinar Paſtor amongſt the Apoſtles, is a fiction of
his own (the whole ſtream of Antiquity avowing all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
to be extraordinar Paſtors, <hi>Peter</hi> as well as the reſt)
Firſt, he makes the other Apoſtles above <hi>Peter;</hi> ſince extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinar
Paſtors are preferred to ordinar Paſtors; the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> enumerating the hierarchy of the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4 puts
extraordinar Paſtors in the firſt place, <hi>viz.</hi> Apoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and Evangeliſts, before Paſtors and Doctors: and ſo
he contradicts himſelf, in affirming, that extraordinar Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
depend upon <hi>Peter,</hi> as their <hi>head,</hi> whom he maketh ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar
Paſtor.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He contradicts himſelf in making the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
Legats to <hi>Peter,</hi> and to omit, he doth ſo without any
ground (having no authority, but his own aſſertion) he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth
himſelf in his reaſon: for he hath no other reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the other Apoſtles are Legats to <hi>Peter:</hi> but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in the original imports one who
is ſent in commiſſion: which is all one with a Legat. But
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> will not deny, that <hi>Peter</hi> in that ſenſe is a
Legat alſo, becauſe he is an Apoſtle, and ſo <hi>Peter</hi> will be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64826:55"/>
Legat to <hi>Peter,</hi> which is perfect none-ſenſe, and contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> borrowed this diſtinction of ordinar and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar
from <hi>Sanderus,</hi> that famous <hi>Engliſh Jeſuit</hi> (who with
his Country-man <hi>Stapleton</hi> invented more new diſtinctions to
uphold the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> then all the
Doctors of the Church beſide) <hi>Sanderus</hi> proves <hi>Peter</hi> to be
ordinar, and the other Apoſtles to be extraordinar, <hi>lib. 6.
cap.</hi> 9. of his <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ordinar</hi> is called ſo from <hi>order,</hi> but in <hi>order,</hi> that is firſt
which is moſt ancient; ſince nothing can be firſt, before that
which is firſt: but <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt, upon whom Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<hi>to build his Church; and to give him the power of the
keys: Ergo,</hi> they were given to <hi>Peter</hi> alone. For albeit after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they were given to all the Apoſtles; yet Chriſt did not
revock what he had given firſt to <hi>Peter:</hi> and the fore <hi>Peter</hi> is
ordinar Paſtor, and the other Apoſtles extraordinar.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, This argument of <hi>Sanderus</hi> preſuppons
many things as granted, which are either uncertain, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
falſe. Secondly, albeit his ſuppoſitions were true,
they do not conclude his aſſertion, that <hi>Peter</hi> is ordinar
Paſtor, having Juriſdiction over the reſt, as extraordinar: He
who would ſee how that <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> of <hi>Sanderus</hi> is retexed at
large, let him read <hi>Chameir, tom. 2. lib. 11. cap. 6. num.</hi> 27.
to the end of the chapter, the ſubſtance of which is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He ſuppons, that as <hi>Ordinar,</hi> which is firſt; that
<hi>extraordinar</hi> which is laſt. But <hi>ordinar</hi> is taken (among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
ſpeaking of Church Officers) for that Office which is
perpetual: extraordinar, for that which is for a time. So in
in the <hi>Old Teſtament, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levits</hi> were ordinar, <hi>Prophets</hi>
extraordinar Officers: and under the <hi>New Teſtament, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Preſbyters,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> are ordinar Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
<hi>Apoſtles, Evangeliſts</hi> extraordinar.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though the diſtinction of <hi>Sanderus,</hi> in that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64826:56"/>
ſenſe of ordinar and extraordinar were granted; his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is uncertain, yea rather notoriouſly falſe: he ſuppons
that <hi>Peter</hi> firſt obtained the power, of <hi>binding, looſing,</hi> and
<hi>feeding the Flock of Chriſt:</hi> but that is uncertain; for theſe
words of Chriſt exhibit nothing to <hi>Peter</hi> for the preſent,
but only promiſe to give him that <hi>power of the Keys,</hi> and <hi>to
build his Church upon him:</hi> neither was that promiſe made to
<hi>Peter</hi> alone, but to all the Apoſtles; as partly hath been
proved already, but more fully ſhal be proved, <hi>cap.</hi> 6. and 9.
and therefore the ſuppoſition of <hi>Sanderus</hi> is uncertain and
falſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Albeit his ſuppoſition were true, it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent,
and proves nothing: for albeit our Savior had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
firſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> the performance of thoſe promiſes, or
<hi>the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> it doth not follow that
<hi>Peter</hi> was ordinar <hi>head</hi> and <hi>Paſtor</hi> of the other Apoſtles,
having Juriſdiction over them: and that they were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinar,
depending upon <hi>Peter</hi> as their <hi>head:</hi> as is declared
by this ſimilitude, a Colledge of Judges conſiſting of ſuch
a number, have afterwards more added to their number:
it doth not follow, that thoſe who were firſt conſtituted, are
ordinar Judges, and the others extraordinar; much leſs,
that thoſe who were firſt conſtituted, have Juriſdiction over
thoſe who were laſt: which is moſt evident in the common
wealth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in which at firſt there were only four
<hi>Pontifices,</hi> but that number was after doubled: at firſt, only
a hundreth <hi>Senators</hi> under the Kings, but that number was
tripled by <hi>Brutus,</hi> and augmented almoſt infinitly by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.
At firſt, there was only one <hi>Praetor,</hi> next, two, one
for the City, an other for Strangers: Laſtly, every Province
had a <hi>Praetor.</hi> But none will deny that thoſe <hi>Pontifices, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,
Pretors,</hi> had as much power as thoſe who were firſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64826:56"/>
conſtitut. And this much of thoſe Fathers interpreting
the Rock to be <hi>Peter.</hi>

               <p>IN the former chapters we have diſputed, <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> (the
principal foundation of the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter,</hi> of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Faith of the Modern Roman Church)
by reaſon &amp; antiquity: of which our adverſaries brag ſo much,
eſpecially of antiquity. Now we will examine the expoſition
of thoſe words, by the teſtimonies of Pops, and Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
interpreting that promiſe of <hi>Chriſt, Upon this Rock I
will build my Church.</hi> So that by <hi>Rock</hi> is not meaned <hi>Peter</hi> at
all, or at leaſt <hi>Peter</hi> alone; by which two things will appear,
that the expoſition of thoſe words, <hi>ſuper hanc Petram</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Modern Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as an article of Faith, is
againſt all Antiquity, and a new deviſed cheat of late, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
the Supremacy of <hi>Peter,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> neceſſar
communion with that Church by an implicit faith; as articles
of the Creed neceſſar unto Salvation, The ſecond thing that
will appear is this, they brag much of Unity and Concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves; but it will appear by this chapter, that
there is no greater diſcord in hell, then is among thoſe of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> taxing one another of madneſs and hereſie,
in the interpretation of thoſe words, <hi>Upon this Rock I will build
my Church:</hi> which words are the principal, if not the only
foundation of the Modern Roman Faith: and it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that thoſe who interpret the <hi>Rock</hi> to be <hi>Peter</hi> only, and
tax others of their own profeſſion of her ſie, are but of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
in compariſon of the others who deny it: and ſince thoſe
others who deny it, are alſo but of yeſterday, in compariſon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64826:57"/>
of Antiquity; it is evident, that this interpretation of <hi>Peters</hi>
alone being the <hi>Rock</hi> is a new deviſed cheat to eſtabliſh the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> not known to the Ancients.</p>
               <p>We ſhewed in the former chapters, that ſome of the Fathers

meaned nothing leſs, then he was the only Rock; and in theſe
words ordained Oecumenick Biſhop. We will diſtinguiſh the
teſtimonies of thoſe following Pops, and Popiſh Doctors in
three Claſſes accordingly: the firſt is, of thoſe intepreting the
Rock to be Chriſt. The ſecond, of thoſe interpreting it

This teſtimony of a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a Saint in the Roman
Calendar is unanſwerable, proving that in his time, the <hi>Rock</hi> was
expounded not to be <hi>Peter,</hi> but Chriſt alone: which he not
only affirms, but proves by this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> when ever <hi>Rock</hi>
is mentioned in Scripture in the ſingular number, none other
is to be underſtood but Chriſt: and whereas thoſe Sophiſters
object, that <hi>Gregorius</hi> is not ſpeaking of thoſe words of Chriſt,
<hi>Upon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi> becauſe he proves it by
the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> the Rock was Chriſt, who is ſpeaking of
that Rock, from which <hi>Moſes</hi> made water iſſue. It is anſwered,
Albeit that be true, that <hi>Paul</hi> is only ſpeaking of that Rock
yet it is falſe, that <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks only of that Rock: his words
are, <hi>where ever in Scripture Rock is mentioned in the ſingular

               <p>Bellarmin <hi>inſtances,</hi> lib. 1. cap. 13. de pont. Rom. <hi>that the</hi>
keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>is univerſal Juriſdiction over
the whole Church: which he proves by three arguments.
The firſt is, from the Metaphor of keyes,</hi> Iſaiah 21.
<hi>where</hi> Shebna <hi>is threatned</hi> to have the keys of the Temple taken
from him, to be given to Eliakim: <hi>that is, ſaith</hi> Bellarmin,
the government of the Temple, or of the houſe of God.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is greatly miſtaken; for,
according to the <hi>Hebrew, Shebna</hi> was not <hi>Perfect</hi> of the
<hi>Temple,</hi> but only of the Kings houſe; <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is deceived
by the <hi>Latin</hi> verſion, turning it <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> whereas <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>
calls it, <hi>Maſter of the Kings houſe,</hi> the <hi>Septuagints,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and they call <hi>Shebna,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Treaſaurer,</hi> or <hi>Maſter-houſhold:</hi>
that is the true interpretation, as appears by
<hi>Kings 2. cap.</hi> 18. in which place <hi>Eliakim</hi> (who ſucceeded to
<hi>Shebna</hi> in that charge) is called by the <hi>Septuagints,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>oeconomus,</hi> or <hi>Maſter-houſhold; Shebna</hi> is called there a <hi>Scribe;</hi>
which place he obtained after the keys of the Kings houſe
were taken from him, and given to <hi>Eliakim.</hi> However it is a
very bad argument of <hi>Bellarmins,</hi> When <hi>Shebna</hi> had the keys
of the Kings houſe, <hi>the government of the houſe was taken
from him, when they were taken away:</hi> Ergo, <hi>When Peter get
the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven from Chriſt, he was made
ſole governor of the whole Church. Bellarmin</hi> ſhould obſerve,
that keys are given ſometime by an Inferior to a Superior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;
although that be but a new invention or ceremony, yet it is
an acknowledgement of authority; as when a King entring
a Town, the keys are delivered to him: But when keys
are given by a Superior to an Inferior, chief Juriſdiction is
no wayes denoted. But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> will not deny that Chriſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64826:60"/>
was Superior to <hi>Peter:</hi> And whereas it is objected, <hi>that
Chriſt hath the key of David</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> that is juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Church. It is anſwered, the caſe is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
none calls the juriſdiction of Chriſt in queſtion, neither
had he the keys from any greater then himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmins</hi> ſecond argument is, That the keys import
<hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing:</hi> that is, <hi>inflicting of puniſhment,
and diſpenſing with obligations of the Law;</hi> which is
ſupream Juriſdiction over the Church: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<hi>Peter</hi> in theſe words is inſtituted Oecumenick
Biſhop.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, That <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi> import no
ſupream Juriſdiction, as appears by its being common to all
the Officers of the Church as well as to <hi>Peter:</hi> it conſiſts
in <hi>bidding, forbidding, puniſhing by Spiritual Cenſures, and
Relaxations from them;</hi> which are common to all Church-Officers,
as ſhal immediatly be proved.</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> proves that our Savior, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
to <hi>Peter</hi> the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to him alone the government of the whole Church, by
the teſtimonies of Fathers. The firſt teſtimony of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomus,
hom.</hi> 55. on <hi>Matthew,</hi> affirming, <hi>that to Peter the
whole world was committed, and that he was made head and
Paſtor of the whole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, It is falſe, that either <hi>Chryſoſtomus</hi>
affirms, <hi>the whole world was committed to</hi> Peter, or, <hi>that he
was head of the Church: Bellarmin</hi> followeth the corrupt
verſion of <hi>Trapezuntius,</hi> in which he ſophiſticats manifoldly:
the words of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> are (comparing <hi>Hieremas</hi> with <hi>Peter)

a word of <hi>Hieremias</hi> being ſet over the <hi>Jews</hi> with Juriſdiction;
and conſequently, if the compariſon hold, <hi>Peter</hi> was not ſet
over the whole world with Juriſdiction: which is the firſt
ſophiſtry of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> following <hi>Trapezuntius,</hi> in ſtead of
<gap reason="foreign">

ſet him over,</hi> which is not in the <hi>Appodoſis</hi> of <hi>Peter.</hi> The
ſecond corruption is, that <hi>Trapezuntius</hi> adds of his own, <hi>Cujus
caput piſcator homo, whoſe head was a Fiſher-man:</hi> It is true
indeed, a little before theſe words, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> calls <hi>Peter Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
of the Church;</hi> but that's nothing to an Oceumenick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop:
for any Apoſtle may be called Paſtor of the Church,
as ſhal be proved afterwards in this Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmins</hi> ſecond teſtimony is of <hi>Gregorius Magnus, lib. 4.
Epiſt.</hi> 32. Where ſpeaking of <hi>Peter</hi> he affirms, <hi>the care of
the whole</hi> Church <hi>was committed to him; and that he was</hi>
Prince <hi>of the Apoſtles.</hi> But it is anſwered, In what
ſenſe <hi>Gregorius</hi> affirms, ſo ſhal be ſhewed at length hereafter;
where it ſhal be proved firſt, that others were called <hi>Princes of
the Apoſtles</hi> beſide <hi>Peter:</hi> and that the care of the whole Church
was committed to others alſo who were not Oecumenick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the impudence of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is very great, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
this place of <hi>Gregorius,</hi> in which he is thundering with
great execrations, and deteſtation againſt any, who taketh
upon him the tittle of Oecumenick Biſhop; <hi>calling that tittle
new, Pompatick, Blaſphemous againſt the mandats of Chriſt, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Apoſtles, and Conſtitutions of the Church:</hi> And among
other reaſons againſt that title of univerſal Oecumenick Biſhop,
he objects this as one: <hi>If any took upon him that title, Peter
had reaſon to take it: but he had not that tittle, although the
care of the whole Church was committed to him:</hi> then this impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64826:62"/>
of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> no greater can be imaginable: <hi>Gregory</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
denyes it to follow, that <hi>Peter was univerſal Apoſtle, or
Biſhop, although the care of the whole Church was committed to
him: Bellarmin</hi> mutilats his paſſage, and makes him conclude,
<hi>that Peter was univerſal Apoſtle or Biſhop, becauſe the care of the
whole Church was committed to him.</hi> He cites this part of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi>
aſſertion, <hi>the care of the whole Church was committed</hi>
to <hi>Peter:</hi> but he ſuppreſſeth the other half of his aſſertion; <hi>that
Peter was not univerſal Apoſtle,</hi> and moſt impudently fathers a
contradictory concluſion upon <hi>Gregory; Ergo, Peter was Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick
Biſhop.</hi> And thus much of the firſt reaſon, wherefore
Proteſtants deny, that the power of the keyes imports no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Juriſdiction of <hi>Peter</hi> alone over the Church.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond reaſon is this, Becauſe <hi>the Keyes of the Kingdom
of Heaven</hi> were given to others beſides <hi>Peter,</hi> which they
prove; Firſt by Scripture, next by Fathers. The paſſages of
Scripture are two. The firſt is, <hi>Mat. 18. 18. Verily I ſay unto
you, Whatſoever ye ſhal bind on earth, ſhal be bound in heaven:
and whatſoever ye looſe on earth, ſhal be looſed in heaven.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place is in <hi>Joh. 20. 23. Whoſeſoever ſins ye remit, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto them, and whoſe ſoever ſins yel retain, they are retained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> anſwers, That thoſe two places now cited have
not the ſame meaning with <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. 19. He grants that
the difficulty is ſomewhat preſſing of <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. 18. but
there is no difficulty at all (ſaith he) in <hi>John</hi> 20. 23. which he
proves by three Arguments. The firſt is this in <hi>Matthew</hi>
16. 19. <hi>The Keyes are promiſed to Peter without any particular
determination; but in John, they are determinated to the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſins: but binding and looſing may be exerciſed in other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
then in pronounccing men guilty of ſin, or abſolving them
from ſin, as in making of laws, and diſpenſing with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, That the Fathers expounding thoſe
words, <hi>What ever ye ſhal bind on earth, &amp;c. Matthew</hi> 16. 19.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64826:63"/>
referrs that place only to the binding and looſing of ſin. So
<hi>Auguſtinus, tractat.</hi> 124. on <hi>John. Eccleſia, quae fundatur in
Chriſto, Claves ab eo regni Coelorum accepit in Petro, id eſt, pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem
ligandi, ſolvendique peccata.</hi> In which words he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
affirms, That the keyes committed to <hi>Peter,</hi> conſiſted
in the binding and looſing of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> Theophylactus <hi>on</hi> Matthew 16. <hi>expreſly affirms,</hi>
What was given to Peter in that place, was given to all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
John 20. <hi>He ſaith indeed,</hi> They were promiſed only to
Peter, Matthew 16. (Chriſt directing his ſpeech only to Peter) but
they were given to all: If ye ask when? (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) it is anſwered,
when he ſaid, Whoſe ſoever ſins ye forgive, <hi>alluding to</hi> John 20.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> affirms, That the power of the
keyes conſiſts alſo in <hi>making of Laws,</hi> he ſaith nothing at all,
except he prove that <hi>Peter</hi> had more authority then the other
Apoſtles in that particular <hi>of making Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmins</hi> ſecond Argument, to prove the ſame thing is not
promiſed to <hi>Peter, Matthew</hi> 16. which is given to the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
<hi>John</hi> 20. is this, in <hi>Matthew</hi> it is ſaid to <hi>Peter,
Whomſoever thou ſhalt bind,</hi> &amp;c. But it is ſaid to the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
in <hi>John, Whoſeſoever ſins ye retain,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>to bind,</hi> is
more then <hi>to retain;</hi> for, to <hi>retain,</hi> is to leave a man in the
ſame condition ye find him; but to <hi>bind,</hi> is to impoſe new
bonds upon him by excommunication, interdicting, and
Law.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, This Argument of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> is of no
moment: becauſe, according to the conſtant phraſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Forgiving of ſins, and looſing of ſins</hi> are all one; <hi>Ergo,</hi> their
oppoſits, <hi>retaining of ſin, binding a ſinner</hi> are all one. Since we
bind men for their ſins only, it is neceſſar, that the ſin being
forgiven, they are looſed: or elſe that they are ſtill retained
if they be not looſed. But it is abſurd to affirm that anys ſins
are forgiven, and yet retained: for <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſeems to ſpeak

of that diſtinction, <hi>viz. remiſſion of fault,</hi> and <hi>remiſsion of
puniſhment,</hi> that is, <hi>the fault may be forgiven, but not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:</hi>
But this diſtinction is vain, and belongs nothing to
this place. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſeems to import, that the Prerogative of
<hi>Peter</hi> is, <hi>to have power of remitting any of them, or both of them,
which the other Apoſtles have not:</hi> wherein he is topped firſt
by <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> upon <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. who attributs <hi>the full power of
binding and looſing to the whole Church:</hi> which he proves in
that inſtance of the inceſtuous Corinthian. Secondly, he is
topped by <hi>Aquinas,</hi> affirming that <hi>every Miniſter binds in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
the Sacrament of the Church to thoſe who are unworthy,
and looſeth, when he admits them to it.</hi> Thirdly, the Interlinear
Gloſs upon <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. affirms that ſins are forgiven and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by two keyes of <hi>power</hi> and <hi>remiſsion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmins</hi> third argument, proving that <hi>John</hi> 20. and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
16. are not alike, is this; becauſe, ſaith he, in <hi>John 20. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of forgiving ſins, by the Sacrament of Baptiſm or Penitence
is only conferred upon the Apoſtles:</hi> which he proveth by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>Cyrillus</hi> upon this place, <hi>John</hi> 20.
and alſo of <hi>Hieronymus, Queſt. 9. ad Hedibia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, Firſt, Thoſe Fathers affirm indeed, that
<hi>Power of forgiving of ſins in Baptiſm is given in this place:</hi> but
it is falſe which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms, that it is only given and no
more. For <hi>forgiving of ſins is but the half of the Power</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
by Chriſt upon the Apoſtles in this place; ſince <hi>retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſins</hi> is alſo given unto them. Secondly, Fathers referr to
Baptiſm that <hi>looſing</hi> given to <hi>Peter, Matthew</hi> 16. So <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,
epiſtle</hi> 73. where he diſputs, <hi>that forgiving of ſins in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is proper to the Paſtors of the Church:</hi> which he proves; firſt,
by <hi>Peter</hi> who got that power, <hi>Matthew,</hi> 16. 19. and alſo by
the other Apoſtles, to whom our Savior ſaid, <hi>Whoſe ſins ye
forgive,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 20. Yea <hi>Gaudentius,</hi> in the firſt day of his
ordination, expreſly affirms, that <hi>the gates of the Kingdom of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64826:64"/>
heaven are opened no other wayes, then by Baptiſm and abſolution:</hi>
and thus much of the ſimilitude of <hi>John</hi> 20. with <hi>Matthew</hi> 16.
By what we have ſaid, it appears that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> brings nothing
but Sopiſtry to prove that the places are not alike.</p>
               <p>He grants that there is great difficulty to prove the diſſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. 19. and 18. 18. Since <hi>binding and looſing</hi> is
given to all the Apoſtles in the laſt place as well as in the firſt to
<hi>Peter;</hi> and not only <hi>retaining,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 20. which <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
affirmed to be a demonſtration, that <hi>John</hi> 20. and <hi>Matthew</hi>
16. were not alike places, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>retaining and forgiving</hi> was
only given to all the Apoſtles, <hi>John</hi> 20 which was not ſo
much as <hi>binding and looſing</hi> given to <hi>Peter, Matthew</hi> 16. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> endeavors to prove that, <hi>Matthew</hi> 16.
19. and 18. 18. are unlike places: although in the laſt <hi>binding
and looſing</hi> be given to all the Apoſtles as well as to <hi>Peter</hi> in the
firſt: Becauſe that <hi>binding and looſing</hi> given to <hi>Peter, Matthew</hi>
16. is of greater authority, then that given to the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<hi>Matthew</hi> 18. 18 His argument is this, which I believe he
underſtands not himſelf.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. (ſaith he) Nothing is given to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
at all, but only it is promiſed to them, and explained
what power they ſhould have afterward? which he prove; by two
reaſons. The firſt is, That they were not yet <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Paſtors,</hi>
or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> when Chriſt made them that promiſe, <hi>Matthew</hi>
18. 18. but only after the reſurrection. Secondly, becauſe thoſe
words, <hi>Whomſoever ye ſhal bind and looſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. are
the paralels of thoſe ſaid to <hi>Peter, Whatſoever thou ſhalt bind
or looſe, Matthew</hi> 16. But in <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. nothing was exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Peter,</hi> but only promiſed: <hi>Ergo,</hi> in <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. nothing
was exhibited to the other Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>It is anſwered, That <hi>Bellarmin</hi> proves nothing but what
he affirmed before, <hi>viz. That it was hard to ſhew a diſparity
between theſe two places:</hi> Or that <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:64826:64"/>
16. 19. and <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 18. for in ſtead of proving
them different places, by his ſophiſtical contradictory bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
he proves they are juſt the ſame: For firſt he grants, that
<hi>nothing was exhibited in either place, but only promiſed.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he grants that the words are alike, <hi>Whatſoever thou ſhalt
bind,</hi> and <hi>whatſoever ye ſhal bind:</hi> Whence he concluds <hi>that
the places are not alike;</hi> whereas he demonſtrats they are
the ſame. It is reaſoning unbeſeeming ſo brave a man to prove
places not alike by alike circumſtances in both. Secondly, he
contradicts what he ſaid before, <hi>viz. That power of Order was
only given unto the other Apoſtles,</hi> John 20. but <hi>power of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to Peter, Matthew</hi> 16. and therefore the places were
unlike, that <hi>power of order</hi> was only given to the other Apoſtles,
<hi>John</hi> 20. he proved by <hi>forgiving</hi> and <hi>retaining:</hi> that <hi>power of
Juriſdiction</hi> was given to <hi>Peter, Matthew</hi> 16. he proves by
<hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing:</hi> but here he grants that <hi>the binding</hi> and <hi>looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
given to the other Apoſtles, <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. and that given to
<hi>Peter Matthew</hi> 16. are <hi>verba ſimilia,</hi> or the ſame words, and
conſequently, that the <hi>keys or power of Juriſdiction</hi> are given
to the other Apoſtles as well as to <hi>Peter:</hi> and conſequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
proves himſelf a lyar, in affirming, that the <hi>keys</hi> given to <hi>Peter,</hi>
were <hi>keys of Juriſdiction,</hi> but not theſe given to the other
Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro adverſus haereſ. lib.</hi> 12. and <hi>Fiſher</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> diſputing againſt <hi>Luther, art.</hi> 25 proves
that the <hi>keys</hi> given to <hi>Peter, Matthew</hi> 16. and theſe given to
the other Apoſtles, <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. are not the ſame which they
prove by an <hi>Achillean</hi> argument, <hi>viz.</hi> it is ſaid to <hi>Peter, What
ever thou bindeſt and looſeſt on Earth, ſhal be bound and looſed
in the</hi> Heavens: but unto the other Apoſtles, <hi>Matthew</hi> 18 it
is only ſaid, <hi>Whomſoever ye bind or looſe on Earth, it ſhal be
bound or looſed in</hi> Heaven; <hi>but to bind and looſe in</hi> Heaven <hi>is
not the ſame, but leſs then to bind and looſe in the</hi> Heavens.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:64826:65"/>
But it is anſwered, Any intelligent perſon may ſee that
thoſe otherwiſe-learned men fight againſt their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
when they are driven to uphold the ſupremacy of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by ſuch childiſh babling: Since men of ſo
great Spirits and Learning, as thoſe two were known to be,
could not be ignorant, that this diſtinction of <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Heavens,</hi> is againſt Senſe, Scripture, and Fathers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is againſt ſenſe, Becauſe none can be ignorant, that
<hi>Heavens in the plural number,</hi> and <hi>Heaven collectively in the
ſingular number</hi> are all one and the ſame thing, in the ordinar
phraſe of ſpeaking: Who is ſo ſtupid as to deny it? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
It is againſt Scripture, which promiſcuouſly uſeth <hi>Heaven</hi>
and <hi>Heavens</hi> in the ſame ſenſe: ſo <hi>Mark</hi> 1. compared with
<hi>Luk.</hi> 3. demonſtrat. In the firſt place, it is ſaid, <hi>The Heavens
were cloven aſſunder.</hi> In the laſt, <hi>the Heaven was opened:</hi>
and yet both the Evangeliſts are relating the ſame thing, when
<hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> baptized our Savior. So, <hi>Matthew</hi> 6. Chriſt
affirmeth, <hi>Lay up treaſures for your ſelves in Heaven;</hi> but,
<hi>Luk. 12. Make your ſelves treaſurs in the Heavens.</hi> Thirdly, this
diſtinction of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Heavens,</hi> is of ſo little moment in
the opinion of the Fathers, that they expreſs, <hi>Matthew</hi> 18.
in the <hi>plural number Heavens,</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. in the <hi>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
number Heaven.</hi> So <hi>Hilarius, lib. 6. de Trinitate</hi> affirms,
That all the Apoſtles had the keys <hi>Regni Coelorum</hi> of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens:
he uſeth the ſame expreſsion in his Book againſt the
<hi>Arrians. Cyprianus, epiſt.</hi> 54. affirmeth that all the Apoſtles
had power of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi> in the <hi>Heavens:</hi> ſo doth
<hi>Chryſoſtomus, lib. 3. de Sacerdotio,</hi> and <hi>Iſidorus Peluſiota, lib. 2.
epiſt.</hi> 5. and <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> againſt the Adverſary of the Law
and the Prophets, <hi>lib. 1. cap.</hi> 17. and <hi>Paceanus, epiſt.</hi> 1. to
<hi>Sympronianus,</hi> and in his book againſt the <hi>Novatians.</hi> All
which Fathers affirm, that the Apoſtles had power of <hi>bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
and <hi>looſing</hi> in <hi>Coelis,</hi> in the <hi>Heavens.</hi> The ſchool-men
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64826:65"/>
likewiſe ſpeak after the ſame manner, as <hi>Lombardus, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</hi>
18. of the firſt chapter, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. and alſo in the ſame
book, <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 19. and <hi>Durandus, queſt.</hi> 1. in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
upon the ſaid 19. <hi>diſtinct.</hi> This is it that proved that all
the Apoſtles had the <hi>keys</hi> not only of <hi>Heaven,</hi> but of the
<hi>Heavens,</hi> whereby it appears by the authority of Scripture,
Fathers, and School-men, that the <hi>keys of Heaven</hi> and of
<hi>Heavens</hi> are one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>If any be not yet convinced, it is further proved they are
the ſame, becauſe the Fathers call the <hi>keys</hi> of <hi>Peter, the keys of
Heaven,</hi> in the <hi>ſingular number:</hi> So <hi>Ambroſius, lib 1. de
penitentia, cap.</hi> 6. and <hi>Auguſtinus contra adverſarium, lib. 1.
cap. 17. Ambroſius</hi> repeating the words of Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Quaecunque ligaveris ſuper Terram, erunt ligata &amp; in
Coelo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which is further confirmed, The Fathers in the ſame place
ſpeaking of Chriſts promiſe to <hi>Peter,</hi> call the <hi>keys</hi> promiſed
to him, both the <hi>keys of Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>keys of Heavens.</hi>
So <hi>Ambroſius</hi> in the now cited place, after the former words
adds, <hi>Et quae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>unque ſolveris ſuper Terram, erunt ſoluta &amp; in
Coelis. Auguſtinus</hi> in the fore-cited place, calls the <hi>keys</hi> given
to the other Apoſtles, both the <hi>keys of Heaven,</hi> and of the
<hi>Heavens;</hi> for after thoſe words (repeating our Saviors promiſe
to the Apoſtles) <hi>Quae ſolveritis ſuper Terram, erunt ſoluta &amp;
in Coelis,</hi> he affirms, <hi>Quae ligaveritis in Terra, erunt ligata
&amp; in Coelo.</hi> And thus we have proved that <hi>Alphonſus de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro,</hi>
and Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> are miſtaken in their diſtinction of
<hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Heavens,</hi> by Reaſon, Scripture and Fathers.</p>
               <p>The original of this diſtinction they have from <hi>Origines,
tract.</hi> 6. in <hi>Matthew,</hi> where, comparing the <hi>keys</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi>
with thoſe words, <hi>Tell the Church, and if he refuſe to hear it,
to make ſatisfaction after three admonitions, let him be unto
thee as a publican;</hi> he affirms, That <hi>Peter, although but one</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:64826:66"/>
perſon, yet had the keys of many Heavens, <hi>but others,</hi> or thoſe
admoniſhers, three times; although many perſons, yet had only
the keys of one Heaven: <hi>and ſo by the teſtimony of</hi> Origines,
Bozius, lib. 18. cap. 1. de ſignis Eccleſie, <hi>ſuſtains that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction</hi>
of Heaven <hi>and</hi> Heavens <hi>mentioned by</hi> de Caſtro <hi>and
Biſhop</hi> Fiſher.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, Thoſe Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
take great liberty to themſelves, in expoſition of the Fathers:
<hi>Bellarmin,</hi> as we ſhewed before, preſſed by a teſtimony of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
not only affirming, but alſo proving, that theſe words, <hi>upon
this Rock I will build my Church:</hi> Or that in theſe words
nothing was promiſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> which was not promiſed to
the other Apoſtles, anſwered, that <hi>Origines</hi> was ſpeaking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorically,
otherwiſe he contradicted himſelf in his 5. <hi>Homily</hi>
upon <hi>Exodus;</hi> where he called <hi>Peter</hi> that <hi>great Foundation:</hi>
which we proved to be no contradiction, <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>By the ſame argument we prove, that <hi>Origines</hi> in this place
is ſpeaking allegorically, otherwiſe he contradicts Reaſon,
Scripture, Fathers, and himſelf: And likewiſe affirms a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius
untruth in this very place alledged. And firſt, that
he contradicts Reaſon, Scripture, and Fathers, in denying the
<hi>keys of Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>keys of Heavens</hi> to be the ſame, we
have juſt now proved, diſputing with <hi>de Caſtro</hi> and <hi>Fiſher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He contradicts himſelf in other places, in
affirming that greater power of the <hi>keys</hi> was given to <hi>Peter</hi>
then to the Others, or that the <hi>keys of the Heavens</hi> are more
then the <hi>keys of Heaven;</hi> becauſe elſe-where he diſputs and
endeavors to prove, that the power of the <hi>keys</hi> given to <hi>Peter</hi>
was the very ſame given to the other Apoſtles, as in his firſt
Treatiſe upon <hi>Matthew,</hi> mentioned before, and vindicated,
<hi>cap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Origen</hi> is comparing the <hi>keys of Peter</hi> with theſe
<hi>three admonitions:</hi> but if he ſpeak literally, he lyeth, in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64826:66"/>
firming, that thoſe Admoniſhers had the power of the <hi>key of
one Heaven</hi> given them from Chriſt, or <hi>that what they did
bind and looſe on Earth, ſhould be bound and looſed in one
Heaven,</hi> which is promiſed no whereby Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Origines</hi> is comparing in theſe words, the power
of <hi>Privat Admoniſhers,</hi> with that of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> having the
power of binding and looſing; and after his manner falls to
Allegories, by this diſtinction of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Heavens:</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
he were not only a lyar in this place, but alſo a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicter
of Reaſon, Scripture, and other Fathers, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felf
in other places. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> thought it a ſufficient Reaſon to
prove that <hi>Origines</hi> ſpake allegorically, <hi>viz. otherwiſe he
would contradict himſelf:</hi> and yet we ſhewed there was no
contradiction; &amp; therefore he cannot in reaſon deny that <hi>Origines</hi>
in this place ſpeaks allegorically, ſince otherwiſe he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
Reaſon, Scripture, all the Fathers, himſelf in other
places, and alſo be a notorious lyar in this ſame alledged place?</p>
               <p>We have have proved already, That <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. 19.
inferrs not that <hi>Peter</hi> was Oecumenick Biſhop, becauſe the
<hi>power of the keys</hi> was no univerſal Juriſdiction over the whole
Church; we undertook to prove it by an other reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the power of the <hi>keys</hi> was not given to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, but to the
other Apoſtles as well as to him: Which we undertook to
prove by two arguments. Firſt, by Scripture. Secondly, by
Fathers. By Scripture we have already proved it, <hi>viz.</hi> from
<hi>Matthew</hi> 18. 18. and <hi>John</hi> 20. 23. vindicated from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of our adverſaries, alledging they were not alike
places with <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. 19, It only remains now, to prove
by teſtimonies of Fathers, that the <hi>keys of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
were given to others, as well as to <hi>Peter:</hi> thoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
are of two ſorts. The firſt is of thoſe affirming directly
that the <hi>keys</hi> were given to others beſids <hi>Peter:</hi> the other ſort
is of thoſe affirming it by conſequence. Of the firſt ſort it is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64826:67"/>
needleſs to mention any more, then we have already mentioned
in the vindication of theſe places: Such as <hi>Hilarius, lib. 6.
de Trinitate,</hi> and <hi>adverſus Arianos, Cyprianus Epiſtola 54.
Chryſoſtomus, de Sacerdotio, lib. 3. Iſidorus Peluſiota, lib. 2.
epiſt. 5. Pacianus, ad Sympronianum, epiſt.</hi> 1. and <hi>in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
againſt the Novatians.</hi> All which teſtimonies expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
That the <hi>keys</hi> were given to others beſide <hi>Peter:</hi> Neither
is it needful to ſet down the words, ſince our adverſaries can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have ſo much impudence as to deny them: To which
teſtimonies may be added, that of <hi>Hieronymus</hi> againſt <hi>Jovina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Cuncti Diſcipuli claves Regni Coelorum accipiunt, all the
Diſciples got the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; of</hi> Origines,
tract. 1. <hi>in</hi> Matthew. <hi>An verò ſoli Petro dantur claves Regni coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,
nec alius beatorum quiſquam eas accepturus eſt? Quod
ſi dictum hoc, tibi dabo claves Regni Coelorum, caeteris quoque
commune eſt, cor non ſimul omnia communia?</hi> In which words
he expreſly affirms, That which was promiſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> was
promiſed alſo to all the Apoſtles, as well as <hi>the keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Servator dans Spiritum
Sanctum Diſcipulis per inſufflationem, ait, accipite Spiritum
Sanctum &amp;c.</hi> It is needleſs to add any more teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Now let us conſider how our adverſaries elude them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And firſt,</hi> Cardinal Pool in his defence of the Eccleſiaſtick
Vnity, lib. 2. <hi>grants thoſe teſtimonies, but he denys that any
thing is proved by them;</hi> viz. That all the Apoſtles had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
power with <hi>Peter,</hi> in the power of the keys, albeit it ſeems to
be the meaning of thoſe Fathers: <hi>which he illuſtrats by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the</hi> 70. Elders: <hi>ſince it is ſaid,</hi> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
11. That God gave unto them a part of that Spirit which
was in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and conſequently, they had the ſame power in
ſubſtance with <hi>Moſes,</hi> but not in ſo excellent a way.</p>
               <p>Maldonatus <hi>anſwers otherwiſe,</hi> viz. <hi>denying,</hi> That
the ſame keys were given to <hi>Peter,</hi> Matthew 16. <hi>and to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64826:67"/>
the other Apoſtles,</hi> Matthew 18. <hi>and</hi> John 20, <hi>his reaſon
is, in the two laſt places,</hi> no mention is made of keys at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stapleton</hi> is more ſubtile, for ſeeing that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
18. What ever ye <hi>ſhal bind,</hi> to all the Apoſtles, is the
ſame with that ſaid to <hi>Peter, Matthew 16. Whatſoever thou
ſhalt bind, &amp;c.</hi> He grants that the ſame <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi>
given to <hi>Peter, Matthew</hi> 16. is given to the other Apoſtles,
<hi>Matthew</hi> 18. but he affirms, <hi>That the keys of the Kingdom of
Heaven,</hi> are a thing different from either of the <hi>bindings</hi> or <hi>looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
in Relec. controverſ.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>queſt. 1. art. 1. concluſ.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Others anſwer, Diſtinguiſhing the <hi>keys of Order and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
they grant that the <hi>keys of Order</hi> were given to all the
Apoſtles, <hi>the keys of Juriſdiction</hi> only to <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is needleſs, particularly to inſiſt upon the refutation of
thoſe new deviſed Sophiſtries, to hold up the ſupremacy of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> they are quite and diametrally oppoſit to the
meaning of all antiquity, of which they brag ſo much, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by two reaſons. The firſt is, that the Fathers diſput
expreſly that the ſame <hi>keys</hi> were promiſed to <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 16.
and to the other Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 20. &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all thoſe diſtinctions deviſed of late by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> &amp; others,
are nothing elſe but fantaſtick dreams, and ſophiſtical evaſions.</p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>Origines, tract.</hi> 1. on <hi>Matthew,</hi> diſputs (as we ſaid)
<hi>That the Church was built alike upon all the Apoſtles, becauſe the
keys were given alike to all the Apoſtles:</hi> by which reaſoning it
appears, that he thought it a thing uncontroverted in his time,
that the <hi>keys</hi> were common to all the Apoſtles, ſince he uſeth
it as a <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Argument</hi> to prove, <hi>That the Church was
built upon all the Apoſtles, as well as upon</hi> Peter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the <hi>keys</hi> were common to all the Apoſtles,
he proves by <hi>John</hi> 20, 23. whereby it is evident, that the
ſaid place is the ſame in meaning with <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. in which
he flatly contradicts <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who confidently affirmed, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64826:68"/>
without all doubt, <hi>forgiving and retaining of ſins,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>John</hi> 20. 23. was not the ſame thing with <hi>binding</hi> and
<hi>looſing, Matthew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 6. 19.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Cyprianus de Vnitate Eccleſiae,</hi> expreſly affirms,
<hi>That Chriſt gave alike power to all his Apoſtles,</hi> Iohn 20. 23. in
theſe words; <hi>Accipite Spiritum Sanctum, ſi cujus remiſeritis
peccata, &amp;c. Receive the Holy Ghost, whoſeſoever ſins ye ſhal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
they are remitted unto them, and whoſe ſoever ſins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
they are retained:</hi> and ſince all the Apoſtles (according to
<hi>Cyprianus</hi>) had alike power given them after the Reſurrection
of Chriſt, by <hi>John</hi> 20. 23. without all queſtion, he believed
that the ſame <hi>power of the keys,</hi> was given to all the Apoſtles,
which was given to <hi>Peter, Matthew</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon, Why thoſe diſtinctions of <hi>Polus,
Maldonatus, Stapleton,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and others; or new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
evaſions is unanſwerable: <hi>viz.</hi> It appears by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that no greater Eccleſiaſtical power imaginable, could
be given to any, then that which was given to all the Apoſtles,
in <hi>Matthew</hi> 18, and <hi>John</hi> 20. which quite deſtroys all thoſe
ſophiſtical diſtinctions, tending all to this: That the power
given to <hi>Peter,</hi> was greater, <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. 19 then that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the other Apoſtles, <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. and <hi>John</hi> 20. That no
greater power can be imagined, then that which was given to
all the Apoſtles, is proved by the teſtimony of <hi>Chryſoſtomus,
lib. 3. cap. 5. de Sacerdotio:</hi> Where ſpeaking of that power of
the <hi>keys</hi> given to all the Apoſtles, yea, and to all Biſhops, he
falls to an interrogative exclamation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>?
That is, <hi>I pray you, what greater power can be given
then this?</hi> But this had been a moſt ridiculous interrogation
in <hi>Chryſoſtomus,</hi> if either he himſelf, or any other had belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that the <hi>power of the keys,</hi> promiſed to <hi>Peter, Matthew</hi> 16.
was greater then that promiſed to the other Apoſtles, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
18. and <hi>John</hi> 20. And thus much of the teſtimonies of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64826:68"/>
thoſe Fathers proving directly, that the <hi>keyes</hi> were given to
others, as well as to <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now followeth the teſtimonies of Fathers, proving by
conſequence, that the <hi>keyes, Matthew</hi> 16. were not peculiar
to <hi>Peter;</hi> out of which teſtimonies, three arguments are dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
The firſt is, If <hi>Peter</hi> alone had the power of the <hi>keyes</hi>
promiſed to him, <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. Then <hi>Peter</hi> would only have
exerciſed the <hi>keyes,</hi> and no other beſide him, in ſuch a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
as he did: But it appears by the teſtimony of <hi>Gauden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
primae de ordinationis ſuae, that all the Apoſtles as well as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
practiſed, the keys, viz.</hi> in teaching, baptizing, &amp; cenſuring.
Yea, <hi>Salmeron</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> in his Commentars upon 1. of <hi>Peter</hi>
1. <hi>diſput.</hi> 1. expreſly affirms, <hi>That Peter ſeemed to neglect his
duty in the exerciſe of the keyes, it ſo little appeared by his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and practiſe, that he had any Juriſdiction over the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi>
Where obſerve the impudent ſhift of the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who
being preſſed by the carriage of <hi>Peter,</hi> that no token of his
Supremacy appeared, hath nothing to anſwer; but <hi>that it was
his own neglest:</hi> which if it be true, was great unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Peter:</hi> if it be falſe, (as it is,) it is great impudence in
the <hi>Jeſuit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond argument taken from the Fathers, proving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially
that the other Apoſtles were promiſed the keyes,
as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> is taken from <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> who affirms, That <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
repreſented the whole Church when Chriſt promiſed him
the keyes: and ſo by conſequence, in <hi>Peter,</hi> the other Apoſtles
and all Paſtors of the Church had the keyes promiſed unto
them: the words of <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> are thoſe following in his
124. <hi>tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>at.</hi> upon <hi>John, Quando Petro dictum eſt, tibi dabo
claves regni coelorum, &amp; quodcunque ligaveris ſuper terram, erit
ligatum &amp; in coelis, univerſam ſignificabat Eccleſiam.</hi> And a
little after, <hi>Eccleſia, Ergo, quae fundatur in Chriſto, claves ab co
regni Coelorum accepit in Petro, id eſt, poteſtatem ligandi, ſolven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dique
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64826:69"/>
peccata.</hi> In which words he expreſly affirms, <hi>That Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was a figure of the whole Church, when our Savior promiſed
him the keyes:</hi> and therefore in <hi>Peter</hi> the keyes were given to
the whole Church, and not to <hi>Peter</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>Our adverſaries puſſed with this teſtimony of <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi>
after their accuſtomed manner, fall to their new deviſed diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
explaining how the keyes were given to <hi>Peter,</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the whole Church? Or how they were given to the whole
Church in <hi>Peter?</hi> And firſt <hi>Horantius, lib. 6. cap. 10. Locor.
Cathol.</hi> affirms, That the keys were given to the whole Church
in <hi>Peter;</hi> that is ſaith he, <hi>They were given to Peter for the good
of the whole Church,</hi> as when any is made King of any Nation,
the Kingdom or Kingly Authority is given to him for the
good of the whole Nation: and ſo <hi>Peter,</hi> as Prince of the
Church, had the keyes given unto him for the good of the
whole Church: and in this manner, the keyes were given to
the whole Church in <hi>Peter.</hi> But it is anſwered, <hi>Horantius</hi>
his Gloſs is far beſide the Text of <hi>Auguſtiuus;</hi> who expreſly
diſputs, <hi>The keyes were not given to Peter alone, but to the
whole Church:</hi> for if they were only given to <hi>Peter,</hi> the whole
Church would not have exerciſed them: he diſputs ſo, <hi>tractat.</hi>
50. upon <hi>John,</hi> and therefore concluds, that the keyes were
not given alone to <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe the whole Church exerciſed
them as well as <hi>Peter: Auguſtinus</hi> doth not diſput for what
end the keyes were given? but to whom alſo this Gloſs of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantius</hi>
expreſly contradicts <hi>Auguſtinus Horantius</hi> affirms,
<hi>That the keyes in the ſame manner were given to the whole
Church in Peter, as when any is made King of a Nation, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a King is given to the whole Nation: that is,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>He who is made King gets that Authority for the good of the whole
Nation:</hi> which is a flat contradiction of <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> for that
Nation, or whole Nation cannot be ſaid to exerciſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Authority, when he who is made King gets it: But <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:64826:69"/>
expreſly diſputs, That the whole Church exerciſed the
keyes as well as <hi>Peter:</hi> and therefore the keyes were given to
the whole Church in <hi>Peter:</hi> otherwiſe, ſaith he, The whole
Church would not have exerciſed them, <hi>tractat.</hi> 50. His words
are, <hi>If Peter had not repreſented the Church, our Lord had not
ſaid unto him, I will give unto thee the keyes of the Kingdom of
Heaven. For if that only was ſaid to Peter, The Church hath
no power of binding or looſing, and ſince the Church hath that
power, Peter was the Sacrament or Figure of the whole Church, or
miſtically repreſented the whole Church, when our Savior promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to him the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and that is the
ſum of the diſput of <hi>Auguſtinus, tractat.</hi> 50. For ſatisfaction
of the Reader we will ſet down his words which are theſe, <hi>Nam
ſi in Petro non eſſet Eccleſiae Sacramentum, non ei diceret Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
tibi dabo claves regni coelorum, &amp; quaecunque ſolveris in
terra, ſoluta erunt in coelo: &amp; quaecunque ligaveris in terra, liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
erant &amp; in coelr. Si hoc Petro tantum dictum eſt, non facit hoc
Eccleſia: Si autem &amp; in Eccleſia fit, ut quae in terra ligantur, in
coelo ligentur, &amp; quae ſoluuntur in terra, ſoluantur in coelo, quia cum
excommunicat Eccleſia, in coelo ligatur excommunicatus: cum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliatur
ab Eccleſia, in coelo ſoluitur excommunicatus: ſi hoc,
Ergo, in Eccleſia fit. Petrus quando claves accepit, Eccleſiam ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stam
ſignificavit.</hi> By which it appears, that he expreſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puts
that <hi>Peter</hi> had not the keyes given to him alone, becauſe
the whole Church uſed them as well as he: and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluds,
that he repreſented the whole Church, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
promiſed to him the keyes: and therefore it is falſe which
<hi>Horantius</hi> affirms, <hi>That the whole Church got the keyes in Peter,
as Germany gets the Empire, when any is made Emperor of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi>
Since all <hi>Germany</hi> doth not exerciſe the Imperial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as the whole Church doth that of the Keyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> gloſſeth otherwiſe upon <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> he affirms,
<hi>Peter</hi> may be ſaid two wayes to repreſent the Church. Firſt,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64826:70"/>
                  <hi>hiſtorically,</hi> as when any repreſents that which is done by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by that which is really done by himſelf: and ſo, ſaith he,
<hi>Abraham</hi> having two ſons, <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> repreſented God,
who was to have two peoples. The ſecond way of <hi>Bellarmins</hi>
repreſenting, is called by him <hi>Parabolick, viz.</hi> when any thing
is repreſented by a probable fiction, not really done: So our
Savior preaching the Goſpel, is ſignified by <hi>a ſower of good ſeed.</hi>
He applyeth that <hi>Peter</hi> ſignified the Church the firſt way: ſo
that he <hi>truly, principally,</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> got the keyes; and
in getting them, ſignified the whole Church: which was to get
them afterwards in its own proper way.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, It is very ordinar with <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to ſpin
out ſubtilties nothing to the purpoſe to delude bis readers,
when he is puſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed: it were prolix to retex his ſophiſtry in this
particular: we only anſwer, that <hi>Peter</hi> repreſented the Church
in none of thoſe wayes mentioned by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> but in a third,
<hi>viz. As when a Society alike intereſſed in any priviledge, hath
that priviledge given to them all, when it is given to any one
of them:</hi> in which caſe, every one of that Society hath the
benefit of that priviledge as well, and equally with him, to
whom it was given in all their names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> objects, That it is not the meaning of <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi>
that <hi>Peter</hi> got the keyes in the name of the reſt as their Legat,
or Vicar: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is his meaning, that <hi>Peter</hi> got them as their
Moderator, or Prince: as when any thing is given to a King,
it may be ſaid to be given to the whole Kingdom, becauſe it is
given for the publick utility of all.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, It is true which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms, that
<hi>Peter</hi> did not get the keyes as a <hi>Legat, or Vicar gets any thing in
the name of his King:</hi> for ſo <hi>Peter</hi> had gotten nothing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
no more then an Ambaſſador repreſenting his King, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
a wife to his King or in his Kings Name: but it doth not
follow that <hi>Peter</hi> got the keyes as Monarch of the Church, or
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64826:70"/>
as the Church got them in <hi>Peter,</hi> as a <hi>Kingdom gets any thing
given to their King:</hi> becauſe it is notoriouſly falſe, ſince the
Church, according to <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> had the power of the keyes,
as well as <hi>Peter:</hi> but a Kingdom hath not the uſe or property
of that which is given unto their King: and therefore we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
That <hi>Bellarmins</hi> enumeration is ſtill inſufficient; for
<hi>Peter</hi> got the keyes neither as Vicar of the Church, nor a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
or Prince of the Church, but as one of the Society of
the Paſtors and Apoſtles of the Church, as if our Savior had
ſaid to <hi>Peter, I give unto thee the power of the keyes, and in
thee to all Paſtors, to be alike exerciſed by thee and them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bellarmin <hi>inſtances that</hi> Auguſtinus <hi>affirms, that the Church
was ſignified by</hi> Peter, Propter eum quem gerebat Primatum,
<hi>that is,</hi> Becauſe of the Primacy he had in the Church.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, That <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> by <hi>Primacy</hi> means no
other thing then <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> that is, <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> affirms, <hi>Peter
had a Primacy in the Church, becauſe he was an Apoſtle in the
Church:</hi> as he explains himſelf in many places, as in his laſt
Treatiſe upon <hi>John,</hi> he affirms that <hi>Peter ſignified the whole
Church, becauſe of the Primacy of his Apoſtleſhip; propter Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolatus
Primatum:</hi> he hath the like words in his 23. Sermon
upon the words of Chriſt, and likewiſe upon <hi>Pſalm</hi> 108. and
eſpecially, <hi>lib. 2. of Baptiſm againſt the Donatiſts,</hi> he hath theſe
words, <hi>Quis nes cit illam Apoſtolatus Principatum, cuilibet Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patui
preferendum? Who knows not that the Primacy of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleſhip
is to be preferred to any Biſhoprick?</hi> by which it is moſt
evident, that the meaning of <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> affirming, <hi>Peter had
a Supremacy in the Church,</hi> is no other, then that he was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
of the Church. Eſpecially ſince <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> diſputed,
that the keyes were not given to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, but alſo to the
whole Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Bellarmin <hi>inſtances, it is true,</hi> That the whole Church
had the uſe of the keyes, as well as Peter, but by the gift of Peter,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64826:71"/>
                  <hi>who diſtributed them to other Paſtors, according to his pleaſure:</hi>
himſelf only having them immediately from Chriſt; as when a
King, having his power <hi>immediately from God,</hi> communicats
his Juriſdiction to inferior Magiſtrats, in giving them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
charges of exerciſing <hi>Juriſdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, This Gloſs of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> is againſt all
Antiquity: innumerable teſtimonies of Fathers might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
that the other Apoſtles had the <hi>keyes</hi> given them as
well as <hi>Peter:</hi> but <hi>Bellarmin</hi> cannot produce one teſtimony to
prove that the meaning of thoſe Fathers is, <hi>That the keyes were
immediately given to Peter, and by his communication diſtributed
to the reſt.</hi> Nothing ſuch appears out of <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> but the
contrair. <hi>Cyprianus</hi> expreſly affirms, That <hi>all the Apoſtles were
of alike power with Peter.</hi> And <hi>Franciſus de Victoria,</hi> a great
Popiſh Doctor, the moſt learned Divine that ever <hi>Spain</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
as he is called by <hi>Canus, loc. Theol, lib. 12. cap. 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.
2. queſt. 2. concluſ. 3. and</hi> 4. Commenting upon that
place of <hi>Cyprian de unita. Eccleſ.</hi> expreſly affirms, That <hi>all
the Apoſtles received all the power both of Order, and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
immediatly from Chriſt:</hi> and inveighs againſt the ordinar
Gloſs upon that place, for diſtinguiſhing between <hi>Order</hi> and
<hi>Juriſdiction:</hi> that is for affirming, That all the Apoſtles had
their <hi>Orders</hi> immediately from Chriſt, but not their <hi>Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
or the power of the keyes: which he affirms to be farr
from the meaning of <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third argument of Fathers, proving by conſequence,
that the</hi> keyes <hi>were given to others alſo beſide</hi> Peter, <hi>is, becauſe</hi>
Peter <hi>ſpoke in the name of the reſt, or anſwered the queſtion of
our Savior for them all:</hi> Anſelmus <hi>on</hi> Matthew 16. <hi>hath theſe
words,</hi> Notandum eſt, quod haec poteſtas, non ſolum Petro data
eſt: ſed ſicut Petrus, unus pro omnibus reſpondit, ſic in Petro
omnibus hanc poteſtatem dedit: It is to be obſerved, that this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the keyes was not only given to Peter, but as Peter alone
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64826:71"/>
anſwered for them all, ſo in <hi>Peter</hi> he gave that power unto them
all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> anſwers, That <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered for all as their <hi>Prince,
Head,</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> not as one <hi>commiſsionat</hi> from them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
in all their names: in which caſe, he would have known
what they were to anſwer to our Saviors queſtion? asking
them <hi>what he was?</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> did not know what the other
Apoſtles would anſwer to that queſtion of our Savior; and
therefore he anſwered as their Prince and Head.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, We grant that <hi>Peter</hi> was not <hi>commiſsionat</hi>
from the reſt to anſwer for them; but we deny it to follow,
that he anſwered as their <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Head:</hi> there is amids, <hi>viz.</hi>
he anſwered <hi>as one of their number,</hi> as when any is riding out
the way, he meets with a number of people, asks of them the
right way, or ſome other queſtion: one more ready then the
reſt anſwers firſt. It is notorious he had no commiſſion from
the reſt to anſwer; and yet it doth not follow, that he is <hi>Head</hi>
or <hi>Prince</hi> of the reſt: by which it appears, that this reaſoning of
<hi>Bellarmins</hi> is nothing elſe but Sophiſtry: and whereas <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
affirms, That <hi>Peter anſwered only for himſelf,</hi> and not for the
reſt, becauſe he knew not what they would anſwer; It is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous,
becauſe it was ſufficient, that <hi>Peter</hi> knew what they
ought to have anſwered, if they anſwered aright: <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
urgeth, a reward is given to <hi>Peter</hi> in theſe words for his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
but ſince the others did not anſwer at all, but only him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
without <hi>commiſsion</hi> from the reſt; It follows of neceſſity,
that the reward, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>keyes</hi> were given to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, and
not to the reſt; eſpecially, ſince our Savior affirms, That it
was revealed by God only to <hi>Peter,</hi> that Chriſt was the Son
of God.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, The words of our Savior are, <hi>That the
ſaid myſtery was revealed to</hi> Peter <hi>by God only:</hi> but it doth not
follow, <hi>That it was revealed to</hi> Peter <hi>only:</hi> that is uncertain,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64826:72"/>
yea, rather notoriouſly falſe: Since <hi>Peter, John</hi>

name of all the reſt, hath theſe words, <hi>And we believe, and are
ſure that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the living God:</hi> by which
it appears, that the other diſciples knew that myſtery as well as
<hi>Peter,</hi> ſince <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly affirms in that place, <hi>They all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> inſtances, how know we that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake for the
reſt, and not for himſelf alone? ſince it cannot be gathered
from the Text. But it is anſwered firſt, How knoweth <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
that <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered for himſelf and not for the reſt? Since
no ſuch thing can be gathered from the Text. It is anſwered,
Secondly, That it is evident from the Text, that <hi>Peter</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the reſt: becauſe Chriſt asked not the queſtion of <hi>Peter</hi>
alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of them all: he asketh <hi>whom they thought he was:</hi>
and ſince <hi>Peter</hi> immediately anſwered (being more ready then
the reſt, as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> affirms) it is evident, that <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered
in the name of them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franciſcus Agricola,</hi> beſides thoſe reaſons of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> adds
others to prove, that <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered for himſelf alone, and not
for the reſt: His firſt reaſon is this, Becauſe he anſwered not
for <hi>Judas,</hi> ſince <hi>Judas</hi> believed no ſuch thing <hi>as Chriſt was the
Son of God;</hi> Ergo, he anſwered not for them all. But it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
It doth not follow. He anſwered not for them all, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Judas</hi> believed not: becauſe, <hi>John 6. 69. Agricola</hi> will
not deny that <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered for them all; and yet, the not
believing of <hi>Judas</hi> might as well militat againſt his anſwering
for them all, <hi>John</hi> 6. as <hi>Matthew 16. Peter</hi> anſwered,
What they all ought to have believed: and in ſo doing, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for all, albeit they did not all believe.</p>
               <p>Another of <hi>Agricola</hi> his reaſons not mentioned by <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
is this, Our Savior pronounced only <hi>Peter bleſſed,</hi> and not the
other Apoſtles: <hi>Ergo, Peter</hi> anſwered only for himſelf; and not
for all: otherwiſe our Savior would have called them all <hi>bleſſed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:64826:72"/>
But it is anſwered, Our Savior called only <hi>Peter bleſſed,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Peter</hi> only anſwered: and ſo in pronouncing him <hi>bleſſed,</hi>
He called them all <hi>bleſſed,</hi> becauſe he anſwered in the name
of them all. So, <hi>Hilarius, de Vinctat.</hi> 6. alluding to this

only for himſelf, and not for all; but they are the
ſame with thoſe of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> which we anſwered already:
and thus much of the <hi>keys, Matthew</hi> 16. 19. which is the
ſecond argument pretended by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>that</hi> Peter <hi>was inſtituted Oecumenick Biſhop by Chriſt.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of Iohn 21. 15, 16, 17. Or feed my Sheep.</head>
               <p>THe third argument, proving that our Savior ordained
<hi>Peter Monarch of the Church,</hi> is taken from the
words of our Savior, <hi>John</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17. where
thrice our Savior commands him <hi>to feed his Sheep,</hi>

our Savior injoyned the <hi>feeding of his Sheep</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi>
it doth not follow that he ordained him <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop:</hi>
for three reaſons The firſt is, becauſe <hi>feeding of Chriſts Sheep</hi> is
not to command <hi>Chriſtians, nor to exerciſe dominion over

                  <hi>Bellarmin, lib. 1. cap. 15. de Pont. Rom.</hi> endeavors to prove,
that in the word <hi>Feeding, ſupream Juriſdiction over the whole
Church</hi> is committed to <hi>Peter</hi> by ſeveral reaſons. The firſt
is, that it <hi>comprehends all the duty of a Paſtor:</hi> which conſiſts
not only in <hi>Miniſtring Food,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Governing</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſing:</hi>
As appears by our Savior uſing the <hi>Greek verb,</hi>

               <p>But it is anſwered, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſubtilty in ſuch <hi>Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms</hi>

<hi>Greek verb,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

the <hi>Syrian Interpreters,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Latin</hi> renders the ſame
way, <hi>viz. to feed.</hi> But it is notorious that the <hi>verb</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
imports no dominion at all; but only <hi>Miniſtration of food.</hi>
Secondly, albeit there were ſuch a Myſtery in the <hi>Greek verb,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmins</hi> ſecond reaſon, by which he proves that ſupream
authority is given to <hi>Peter,</hi> by theſe words of our Savior,
<hi>Feed my Sheep,</hi> is, becauſe ſeveral Fathers, calls that which
was injoyned to <hi>Peter,</hi> in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Praefectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi>
or, <hi>A having authority over the Flock of Chriſt:</hi> So
<hi>Chryſoſtomus, lib. 2. de Sacerdotio,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtnius</hi> on
<hi>John</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is diſputing there of the <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
which is common to all <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and not of an <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Biſhop:</hi> Neither can it be denyed, that any Biſhop hath
that authority over his own Flock, which is mentioned by
<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in that place: <hi>viz. Governing</hi> and <hi>Chaſtiſing,</hi>
which is alſo the meaning of <hi>Auguſtinus. Bellarmin</hi> cites an
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64826:73"/>
other teſtimony of <hi>Gregorius, de cura Paſtorali,</hi> where <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi>
are called by him <hi>Rectors;</hi> but his meaning is the ſame,
as appears by the ſcope of his diſput, needleſs to be inſerted:
he is enumerating theſe duties belonging to a <hi>Paſtor:</hi> amongſt
which, he doth not mention one peculiar to an <hi>Oecumenick
Biſhop,</hi> and which is not common to all <hi>Paſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> uſeth other reaſons, beſides theſe two, which in
effect, are the ſame with his firſt reaſon: It is very ordinar
with him, to repeat the ſame arguments in other words, to
make ignorants believe that his Army is numerous.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon, wherefore our Savior in theſe words,
<hi>Feed my Sheep,</hi> injoyns <hi>no univerſal juriſdiction over the
Church,</hi> is, becauſe he injoyns the ſame to others beſide <hi>Peter:</hi>
Which is proved, Firſt by Scripture: Secondly, by Fathers.
The paſſages of Scripture, are <hi>John</hi> 20. 21. where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
affirmeth, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you:</hi> Which
words are expounded by <hi>Cyrillus, lib.</hi> 12. in <hi>John,</hi> by <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomus,
hom.</hi> 85. upon <hi>John, By Theophylactus</hi> upon this
place to this purpoſe: <hi>viz. Cyrillus</hi> affirms, That all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
were <hi>ordained Doctors of the whole World, to inlighten
not only the Jews, but all the Nations of the World. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomus</hi>
and <hi>Theophylactus,</hi> interpret theſe words, <hi>That Chriſt
injoyned his own work unto all the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond paſſage of Scripture is, <hi>Matthew 28. 19. Go
therefore and teach all Nations<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> the <hi>Greek verb,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to
Teach,</hi> imports all the authority that a Maſter hath over his
Diſciples; <hi>viz. To Govern them, to Chaſtiſe them,</hi> and not
only to <hi>teach</hi> them: And conſequently, is of as large an extent
as, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to Feed:</hi> Of which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> brags ſo much:
And thus much of Scripture.</p>
               <p>In the next place, it is proved by Antiquity, that nothing
peculiar was imagined to <hi>Peter,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Feed my Sheep.</hi>
The firſt teſtimony is from the third Epiſtle amongſt theſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64826:74"/>
of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in which the <hi>Clergy of Rome,</hi> ſpeaks thus to the
<hi>Clergy of Carthage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sed &amp; Simoni ſic dicit, diligis me? reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
diligo. Ait ei, paſce oves meas. Hoc verbum factum, ex
ipſo actu quo ceſſit, agnoſcimus: &amp; caeteri Diſcipuli ſimiliter.</hi>
By which words it appears, that it was the opinion of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of Rome,</hi> in the days of <hi>Cyprian, That the feeding of the Flock
of Chriſt,</hi> was injoyned to others, <hi>viz.</hi> to all the Apoſtles
as well as to <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cyprianus <hi>himſelf,</hi> de Vnitate Eccleſiae, They are all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
but the Flock is one, which all the Apoſtles feed with one
conſent; <hi>and a little before, immediatly after he had cited
theſe words of our Savior,</hi> Feed my Sheep, <hi>he ſubjoyns,</hi> That
Chriſt gave to all the Apoſtles alike power after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtinus, tract. 123. upon John, Chryſoſtomus, de Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotio,
lib. 2. Baſilius, cap.</hi> 22. of the <hi>Conſtitution of Monks,</hi>
all expreſly affirm, That the <hi>feeding of the Flock of Chriſt,
was committed to all Pastors and Biſhops, by our Savior in
theſe words.</hi> It is needleſs to ſet down the words of
theſe Fathers, ſince theſe teſtimonies are granted by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries;
who notwithſtanding of them, endeavor ſo to prove,
that theſe words of our Savior, were in a peculiar manner
directed to <hi>Peter.</hi> So <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Sanderus,</hi> they reaſon
thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Bellarmin <hi>takes much pains to prove, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
directed his ſpeech only to</hi> Peter, <hi>which none denys:</hi>
Quid tum poſtea? <hi>He inſtances, that the reſt are excluded by
theſe words of our Savior,</hi> Loveſt thou me more then thoſe?
By the three-fold reiteration of that queſtion; <hi>by theſe words of
our Savior,</hi> when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy hands
<hi>and by theſe words of</hi> Peter, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what ſhal this man
do? <hi>And of the anſwer of Chriſt,</hi> What is that to thee? Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thou me. <hi>But, ſay they,</hi> Peter <hi>would never have asked</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:64826:74"/>
what John ſhould do? <hi>If Chriſt had ſaid to</hi> John, Feed my
Sheep, <hi>neither would the Lord have anſwered,</hi> What is that to
thee? Follow thou me: <hi>but he would have anſwered,</hi> He ſhal
feed my ſheep, as thou ſhalt.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, All this reaſoning is nothing elſe, but a
rible rable of ſophiſtry; Firſt, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſophiſticats in ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the queſtion: as if <hi>Proteſtants</hi> denyed, that theſe
words of our Savior were directed to <hi>Peter</hi> alone: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he proves, by all thoſe circumſtances foreſaid, that our
Savior <hi>ſpoke only to Peter,</hi> which none denys. The thing
which is denyed, is, the conſequence, or it doth not follow,
<hi>That the feeding of the Flock of Christ, was only committed to</hi>
Peter, <hi>becauſe the words of our Savior were only directed to
him:</hi> no more then it followeth, <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>ſhould
only increaſe and multiply, becauſe God directed his ſpeech to
them only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Bellarmin <hi>doth not conſider, for what reaſon
our Savior directed his ſpeech to</hi> Peter <hi>only, in theſe words,</hi>
Feed my Sheep? <hi>It was not, becauſe it was his intention to
give to</hi> Peter Juriſdiction over the whole Church: <hi>but for other
two reaſons. The Firſt is, becauſe</hi> Peter had thrice denyed him:
<hi>ſo</hi> Cyrillus <hi>in</hi> John, lib. 12. cap. 64. <hi>who affirms ſo much.
And likewiſe</hi> Iſidorus, Peluſiota, lib. 1. epiſt. 103. <hi>and alſo,</hi>
epiſt. 356. <hi>and</hi> Nazianzenus, in his Oration in Sancta Lumina,
<hi>hath theſe words,</hi> Chriſt admitted <hi>Peter</hi> an Apoſtle again, and
healed his threefold denying of him, by a threefold interrogation,
to which <hi>Peter</hi> made a threefold confeſſion: <hi>by which words,
an other reaſon appears, wherefore our Savior directed his
ſpeech to</hi> Peter <hi>alone?</hi> viz. <hi>To reſtore him to his</hi> Apoſtleſhip,
<hi>which he had loſt, by denying Chriſt.</hi> Cyrillus <hi>in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
place affirms,</hi> Although all the Diſciples were ſore afraid,
and ran away, when Chriſt was apprehended, yet the crime of
<hi>Peter</hi> was greateſt, becauſe he denyed him thrice in ſo ſhort a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64826:75"/>
time: <hi>where he affirms alſo, that the</hi> Apoſtleſhip was reſtored
unto him, <hi>by theſe words of our Savior,</hi> Feed my Sheep. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his anſwering the three-fold interrogation of Chriſt, he
had profeſſed thrice,</hi> He loved Chriſt: <hi>by teſtimonies of
which Fathers, it appears, that nothing</hi> peculiar to Peter <hi>was
given in theſe words,</hi> Feed my Sheep. <hi>Since the</hi> Apoſtleſhip
<hi>is common to</hi> Peter, <hi>with the other Apoſtles. And therefore,</hi>
Peter <hi>was not ordained</hi> Oecumenick Biſhop <hi>in theſe words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Sophiſtry of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> conſiſts in his reaſoning
thus, If <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaith he, had believed that theſe words of
Chriſt had belonged to <hi>John,</hi> as well as to himſelf; or if our
Savior had injoyned to <hi>John, the feeding of his Sheep,</hi> as well
as unto <hi>Peter, Peter</hi> would never have demanded of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior,
<hi>What John ſhould do?</hi> Neither would our Savior have
anſwered him, <hi>What is that to thee? Follow thou me:</hi> For
<hi>Peter</hi> would have known what <hi>John</hi> ſhould do; <hi>viz. Feed
Christs Sheep,</hi> and our Savior would have anſwered him, <hi>John
ſhal feed my Sheep as thou doſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, This diſputation of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> is moſt
ſhameleſs babling for that queſtion of <hi>Peter, Asking what
John ſhould do?</hi> And that anſwer of Chriſt, <hi>What is that to
thee?</hi> are not relative to theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Feed my Sheep:</hi>
but to theſe, verſe 18. <hi>When thou ſhalt be old thou ſhalt ſtretch
forth thine hands:</hi> ſhewing to <hi>Peter</hi> what death he ſhould die?
Whereupon <hi>Peter</hi> asketh Chriſt, <hi>What John ſhould do? or
what ſhould become of him? or what death he ſhould die?</hi> To
which our Savior anſwers, <hi>What is that to thee?</hi> That this
is the true gloſs, appears by the text it ſelf, by the Fathers,
<hi>Cyrillus, Euthymius,</hi> by the <hi>ordinar gloſs,</hi> by all the <hi>Ancient
Popiſh Doctors</hi> upon the place, As <hi>Aquinas, Carthuſianus,
Gorranus, Cajetanus, Toletus,</hi> by late <hi>Popiſh Doctors,</hi> as
<hi>Maldonatus, Barradas,</hi> and <hi>Emmanuel Sa:</hi> So that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi>
gloſs is nothing els but one of his new deviſed fictions, by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64826:75"/>
which he and others of late endeavor to uphold the <hi>ſupremacy</hi>
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrair to common ſenſe, Scripture,
and the whole current of <hi>Popiſh Doctors</hi> themſelves, who
lived before theſe laſt times.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> comes on with an other of his gloſſes,
of like nature: <hi>viz.</hi> ſeeing that it could not be denyed, that
other Apoſtles and Paſtors beſide <hi>Peter,</hi> were injoyned to <hi>feed
the Flock of Chriſt;</hi> ſince it was ſo clearly aſſerted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Fathers; He invents a new diſtinction, that they did
it by the <hi>permiſſiom of Peter,</hi> or to uſe his own words, <hi>Quia
vocantur à</hi> Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ro <hi>in partem ſolicitudinis:</hi> that is, becauſe
they had a calling from <hi>Peter</hi> ſo to do, or, <hi>Were admitted by
him to a part of the care.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, This diſtinction of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> hath not
the leaſt ground. It is againſt <hi>Scripture, John</hi> 20. 21. and
<hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 19. as both paſſages are expounded by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
It is contrair to Fathers, as was proved by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the <hi>Clergy of Rome,</hi> of <hi>Cyrianus,</hi> of <hi>Auguſtinus, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomus</hi>
and <hi>Baſilius.</hi> Finally, it is contrair to <hi>Popiſh Doctors,</hi>
as <hi>Franciſcus de Victoria,</hi> who (as we ſhewed before) diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
expreſly, <hi>That all the Apoſtles had not only their Order,
but alſo their Juriſdiction immediately from Chriſt:</hi> And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the <hi>ordinar gloſs,</hi> for uſing that diſtinction, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of that place of <hi>Cyprian, de Vnitate Eccleſiae. All the
Apoſtles after the Reſurrection had alike authority and power
from Chriſt.</hi> Neither can <hi>Bellarmin</hi> produce one teſtimony
of Antiquity to maintain his gloſs, <hi>viz. That</hi> Peter <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
had the power of feeding the Flock of Chriſt from Chriſt
himſelf, and the other Apoſtles and Paſtors had it only from</hi>
Peter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanderus, lib. 6. cap.</hi> 4. of his <hi>Monarchy,</hi> uſeth another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
from thoſe words of our Savior, <hi>Peter loveſt thou
me more then theſe?</hi> From which words he concluds, <hi>That the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64826:76"/>
Feeding of the flock of Chriſt,</hi> was injoyned immediatly only
to <hi>Peter;</hi> becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>Peter</hi> loved Chriſt better then the
other Apoſtles did: and therefore, <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eeding of the flock of
Chriſt</hi> was committed to him alone, as the reward of his love.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, Firſt, it cannot be gathered from the text,
that <hi>Peter</hi> loved Chriſt better then the other Apoſtles did?
<hi>ſince Chriſt only asked him, whither he loved him better then the
other Apoſtles did?</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered, <hi>thou knoweſt that I love thee:</hi>
but he adds, not <hi>better then the other Apoſtles do.</hi> 2. Tho it were
granted (as ſome of the Fathers maintain) that <hi>Peter</hi> loved
Chriſt better then the other Apoſtles did, it is inconſequent
for that reaſon to conclude, that <hi>Peter</hi> had <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over
the reſt: for the ſame argument would conclude, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>John</hi> had <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over thoſe Apoſtles, who loved
not Chriſt ſo well as himſelf: that <hi>Stephanus</hi> a <hi>Deacon</hi> had <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction</hi>
over <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> and other <hi>Deacon:</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf
had more ample <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> then <hi>Sylveſter ſecond, Alexander
ſixth,</hi> and other Monſters, which were Biſhops of <hi>Rome:</hi> which
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> will not grant readily, ſince all Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi>
are in his opinion, of alike authority with <hi>Peter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Turrianus, lib. 2. cap. 22 in his defence againſt Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deel,
<hi>reaſons thus; Let it be granted (ſaith he</hi>) that all the
Apoſtles, and all Paſtors had their authority of feeding the Flock
of Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it doth not hinder a diſtinction of Order among them, not
though that authority be equal, as they are Paſtors: yet it doth
hinder one to be a Presbyter, an other to be a Biſhop above him,
another to be univerſal Biſhop above all: as all men, qua homines, or
as men <hi>are equals, yet ſome of them are Kings, others</hi> ſubjects.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, It far leſs follows, that there are ſeveral
degrees of Church Orders, becauſe they are of alike authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or that becauſe theſe words, <hi>Feed my ſheep,</hi> were injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with alike authority to <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Rome:</hi>
therefore the one of them was Oecumenick Biſhop, the other
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64826:76"/>
not. The truth is, to anſwer in earneſt to <hi>Turrianus,</hi> its falſe
which he affirms, <hi>That the equality of Authority can conſiſt
Jure Divino with Subordination of one Biſhop to another.</hi> All
Biſhops are <hi>Jure Divino of alike Authority.</hi> Subordination,
or diſtinction of degrees in Biſhops are <hi>Jure humano,</hi> as ſhal
be proved in the following Books.</p>
               <p>We have vindicated two reaſons, why theſe words of our

                  </gap>vior, <hi>Feed my ſheep,</hi> conclude not that <hi>Peter</hi> was ordained
Oecumenick Biſhop. The firſt was, <hi>That feeding of the ſheep
of Chriſt, inferrs no dominion over them.</hi> The ſecond was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our Savior injoyned the <hi>Feeding of his ſheep</hi> to others,
as well as to <hi>Peter:</hi> which we proved by Scripture, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and anſwered all what our Adverſaries objected to the
contrair: Now followeth a third Reaſon, wherefore thoſe
words of our Savior to <hi>Peter, Feed my ſheep,</hi> doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him Oecumenick Biſhop; and is this: becauſe many
were <hi>Chriſts ſheep</hi> whom <hi>Peter</hi> did not feed, as the <hi>Indians,
Ethiopians,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> committed to the Apoſtleſhip of
<hi>Paul:</hi> yea, the very Apoſtles themſelves were the ſheep of
Chriſt, and yet we do not read in Scripture, or in writings
of the Ancients, that ever <hi>Peter</hi> did inſtruct, correct, or ſend
any of the other Apoſtles, or that he had any way dominion
over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſteps in, endeavoring to prove, that <hi>Peter</hi> was

alſo: he endeavors to prove it two wayes. Firſt, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
from words: next, by arguments. He reaſons from
words two wayes. Firſt, by a diſtinction of <hi>ſheep</hi> from <hi>lambs;</hi>
he reaſons thus our Savior ſaith to <hi>Peter</hi> twice, <hi>Feed my lambs,</hi>
and once, <hi>Feed my ſheep:</hi> But, ſaith he, By twice naming of
<hi>lambs,</hi> he means two peoples, <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> by <hi>ſheep,</hi>
he means <hi>Paſtors,</hi> or <hi>the Apoſtles themſelves.</hi> And ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this witty Gloſs, <hi>Peter</hi> is commanded to feed the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64826:77"/>
poſtles alſo. But if ye object to him, That the <hi>Greek</hi> Text
marrs all his ſubtilty, becauſe it hath twice, <hi>Feed my ſheep,</hi>
and but once, <hi>Feed my lambs:</hi> He cuts that knot, by telling
you that the <hi>Greek</hi> Text is corrupt: which is as much as to
ſay, That the <hi>Greek copies,</hi> approved by the Ancients, (as
ſhal be proved, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. is corrupt, and that the <hi>Latin verſion</hi>
(in which there is not ſo much as one ſound line) is <hi>pure,</hi> and
that to maintain a <hi>fantaſtick, ridiculous, groundleſs Gloſs</hi> of a
<hi>Jeſuit,</hi> againſt Scripture, againſt Antiquity, and an object of
laughter, to the moſt Learned of the Roman Church them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>And firſt, It is againſt Scripture, who in that ſort of ſpeech
takes evermore <hi>ſheep</hi> and <hi>lambs</hi> indifferently for the ſame thing,
<hi>Matthew</hi> 10. 16. It is ſaid, <hi>Behold, I ſend you as ſheep in the
midſt of wolves, Luke, cap. 10. verſe</hi> 3. ſpeaking of the ſame
<hi>Miſsion,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Go your wayes: Behold, I ſend you forth as lambs
amongst wolves.</hi> The <hi>Syrian</hi> Interpreter in both theſe places,
calls the Apoſtles <hi>Lambs amongſt Wolves;</hi> yea, our Savior,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. 32. is compared both to a <hi>ſheep</hi> and a <hi>lamb,</hi> from
<hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. 7. as to one thing: <hi>He was led like a ſheep to the ſlaughter,
or like a lamb dumb before his ſhearer:</hi> What thinks <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
of his ſubtile diſtinction now? Secondly, all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon the ſaid paſſage of <hi>John</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17. interprets
<hi>lambs</hi> and <hi>ſheep</hi> to be one thing. So <hi>Auguſtinus, tractat.</hi> 123.
upon <hi>John; Cyrillus</hi> upon <hi>John, lib. 12. cap. 64. Chryſoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
on <hi>John, Homily 87. Ambroſius,</hi> or the Author of thoſe
ſermons attributed to him, Sermon 46. It is needleſs to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
other Fathers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> expoſes himſelf to the laughter of his
own fellow <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> as appears by two teſtimonies. The firſt
is of <hi>Maldonat the Jeſuit,</hi> upon <hi>John</hi> 21. Where he hath thoſe
words, <hi>Agnos eſſe eos, qui in grege, id eſt, in Eccleſia Chriſti
eſſent, dubium non eſt, nec ſubtiliter diſputandum, cur agnos
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64826:77"/>
potius, quàm oves appellaverit? quod qui fecerit, videat etiam
atque etiam, ne doctis hominibus riſum praebeat;</hi> where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
affirms, <hi>Thoſe who make ſuch diſtinctions, as</hi> Bellarmin,
<hi>between lambs aud ſheep, expoſeth themſelves to the laughter of
learned men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond teſtimony is of <hi>Janſenius in his Concordance,</hi>
It is needleſs to ſet down his teſtimony, the ſubſtance of it is,
That there is no my ſtery at all that Chriſt now ſaith, <hi>Feed my
ſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>p,</hi> then <hi>feed my lambs.</hi> The Evangeliſt only changeth the
terms, or words, ſignifying the ſame thing, <hi>Elegantiae cauſâ,
for elegancy, or ornatneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmins</hi> ſecond reaſon from words, is from thoſe words of
our Savior, <hi>My ſheep, my lambs.</hi> All the Apoſtles, ſaith <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi>
are <hi>the ſheep of Chriſt: Ergo, Peter</hi> is commanded to
feed them all by thoſe words, <hi>Feed my ſheep;</hi> ſince none are
excepted, and therefore the indefinit Precept, <hi>Feed my ſheep,</hi>
is equivalent to this univerſal Precept, <hi>Feed all my ſheep.</hi> Which
<hi>Turrianus</hi> confirms not only by the Pronoun <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but alſo by
the <hi>Greek</hi> article <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which article<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun
evermore maketh an indefinit univerſal.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, This argument of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> is of like
ſolidity with the former. Firſt, it is againſt Scripture, to call
an <hi>indefinit propoſition univerſal,</hi> as Acts 2. 17. <hi>And your ſons
and your daughters ſhal propheſy, and your young men ſhal ſee
viſions, and your old men ſhal dream dreams:</hi> This one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
overthrows the ſophiſtry of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Turrianus.</hi>
Theſe propoſitions are <hi>indefinit:</hi> if <hi>univerſal,</hi> they were noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
falſe; and yet they have both the Articles <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and the pronoun <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Albeit all the <hi>Apoſtles be the Sheep of Christ,</hi> yet
ſome of Chriſts Sheep are only fed by himſelf immediately,
ſuch as the Apoſtles: others are fed by thoſe whom Chriſt
appoints, and thoſe are only the Sheep our Savior means in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64826:78"/>
theſe words, <hi>Feed my Sheep:</hi> viz. all others beſides the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
which are alike fed by all the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> from his ſophiſtry in words,
falls to his ſophiſtry in arguments. His firſt argument is this,
Theſe words, <hi>Feed my Sheep,</hi> are all one, as if our Savior had
ſaid, <hi>Rule my Sheep-fold,</hi> or <hi>Flock:</hi> but the Sheep-fold of
Chriſt is only one, in which the Apoſtles are alſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> our Savior in theſe words, injoyns <hi>Peter</hi> to
feed the Apoſtles alſo.</p>
               <p>The ſophiſtry of this reaſon appears by the parallel of
theſe words, <hi>Matthew 28. 19. Go ye teaching all Nations,</hi>
which queſtionleſs is to teach the Sheep-fold of Chriſt
which is but one. And ſince <hi>Bellarmin</hi> will not deny, that
<hi>Peter</hi> is one of that <hi>Sheep-fold: Ergo,</hi> according to <hi>Bellarmins</hi>
Logick, all the Apoſtles are injoyned in theſe words, <hi>to teach
Peter,</hi> or to <hi>feed Peter:</hi> which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> will not deny to be
a great paradox.</p>
               <p>The ſophiſtry of this ſort of reaſoning, is all one with that,
making <hi>paſce oves meas,</hi> an univerſal Precept; which is only,
indefinit. There is a great difference alſo between <hi>unum Ovile,</hi>
and <hi>univerſum Ovile: Vnum Ovile</hi> is recommended to every
Biſhop, but not <hi>univerſum Ovile:</hi> in a word, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theſe <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Lambs,</hi> are meant others beſides the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and not the Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
               <p>Bellarmins <hi>ſecond ſophiſtry is this, Our Savior in theſe
words,</hi> commends unto <hi>Peter,</hi> either all his Sheep, or none of
them, or ſome certain indefinit Sheep, or indefinitly Sheep: Its
falſe, that no Sheep are commended to <hi>Peter,</hi> or that ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Sheep are commended to <hi>Peter,</hi> or indefinit Sheep are
commended to <hi>Peter: Ergo,</hi> All the Sheep are commended to
<hi>Peter,</hi> and conſequently the Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, Firſt, we retort the ſophiſtry, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
28. 19. our Savior <hi>injoyns all the Apoſtles to teach,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64826:78"/>
either ſome certain perſon, or no perſons, or indefinit perſons, or
all perſons. But the firſt three are abſurd,</hi> (if <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Logick
hold) <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are commanded to teach all perſons, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<hi>Peter</hi> himſelf: which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> will not deny to be
a great Paradox.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ommitting theſe foolries, we affirm, That our
Savior in thoſe words injoynes <hi>Peter,</hi> and all the Apoſtles, <hi>to
teach that doctrine which he had revealed unto themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly:</hi>
that is, as he had fed them, ſo they ſhould feed
others beſide themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boſius de ſignis</hi> comes in with a <hi>notable ſophiſm</hi> which is
this, our Savior (ſaith he) ſaith not to <hi>Peter, Feed my
ſheep hereafter,</hi> but in the preſent tenſe, <hi>Feed now my ſheep:</hi> But
when our Savior ſpake theſe words, he had no other ſheep
but the Apoſtles: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſaith he, our Savior commands <hi>Peter</hi>
to feed the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, we retort the argument juſt as we did
before, our Savior, <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 19. affirmeth, <hi>Teach ye all
Nations</hi> in <hi>the preſent tenſe,</hi> but <hi>there were no other Chriſtians
to be taught then, but the Apoſtles</hi> (if <hi>Bozius</hi> ſubſume right.)
Ergo, <hi>the Apoſtles there, are commanded to teach</hi> Peter, <hi>which
he will not eaſily grant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is anſwered, Secondly, there is no difficulty in the words
at all, the meaning of our Savior is no other, then that <hi>Peter</hi>
being by theſe words ordained an Apoſtle, or reſtored to his
Apoſtleſhip (according to ſome Fathers) is injoyned to put
his function in practice, with the firſt occaſion: in the ſame
ſenſe, that the other Apoſtles, <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 19. are injoyned,
to go and teach all nations, who were ſubjected to them, by
right of their Apoſtleſhip: But in this place, <hi>John</hi> 21. to
affirm, that the other Apoſtles were ſubjected to <hi>Peter,</hi> by
reaſon of his Apoſtleſhip, is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> which we affirm
to be notoriouſly falſe.</p>

               <p>VVE have prolixly diſputed thoſe three paſſages of

               <p>
                  <hi>If our Savior, ſaith he, had ſaid to</hi> Peter, I will not build the

                  </gap>
the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven: what thou binds on earth
ſhal be bound in Heaven: and what thou looſeſt on earth ſhal be

ſheep: <hi>therefore ſaith he, It cannot be denyed, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
in theſe three paſſages, ordained the Apoſtle</hi> Peter <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of the Church: Becauſe, if the negation of thoſe things
conclude, that</hi> Peter <hi>was not ordained Head of the Church by
Chriſt, the affirmation of them concluds he was: having thus
reaſoned, he falls to the commendation of his own</hi> acumen:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64826:79"/>
                  <hi>and of his invincible Argument: affirming, (not without
laughter and aſtoniſhment of thoſe who read him</hi>) Hic niſivel
conſcientia reclamante, vel praecipitante inſcitia, &amp; inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitantia,
nihil ab adverſariis reſponderi poſſe, certiſsimus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
ſum. That is I am certainly perſwaded, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> That nothing
can be anſwered to this argument by our adverſaries, except they
be blinded either with ignorance, or fight againſt the light of
their own conſcience.</p>
               <p>When I read this argument of <hi>Valentia,</hi> as it is related by
<hi>Chameir, tom. 2. lib. 11. cap. 19. num.</hi> 11. I believed that
<hi>Chameir</hi> had miſtaken him, or elſe that there was <hi>vitium Typo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphi,
or a fault of the Printer:</hi> but when I conſulted <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
himſelf in his <hi>Analyſis, lib. 7. cap.</hi> 7. and his <hi>Commentarys</hi>
upon <hi>Thomas.</hi> I found to my aſtoniſhment, that he ſo played
the fool, and then bragged of his madneſs. This argument
of his is a moſt ridiculous Sophiſm: and I cannot but admire
that any learned man (ſuch as <hi>Valentia</hi>) was not aſhamed to
make uſe of ſuch an Argument, much more to brag of it as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible.</p>
               <p>The ground of his argument conſiſt in a <hi>Topick Axiom</hi> of
his own diviſing againſt all the rules of <hi>Logick: viz. If the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of a certain particular conclude any thing not to be: then
the affirmation of the ſaid particular coucluds the ſaid thing to be,</hi>
as one would reaſon thus, if the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was not a Paſtor
of the Church, he was not Oecumenick Biſhop, <hi>Ergo,</hi> if he
was a Paſtor of the Church, he was Oecumenick Biſhop:
which argument would prove any Paſtor of the Church, or all
Paſtors of the Church to be Oecumenick Biſhops. So this <hi>axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om</hi>
of <hi>Valentia</hi> is the foundation of a Syllogiſm conſiſting of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatives
in the ſecond figure: as one would reaſon thus.</p>

Who ſees not this reaſoning to be childiſh ſophiſtry? how can

It is notorious, if we endeavor to reaſon according to that
<hi>Axiom</hi> of <hi>Valentia:</hi> We muſt either reaſon thus, in the ſecond

of <hi>Rome,</hi> having no ground in Scripture and Antiquity,
the faith of the <hi>Modern Roman Church is no faith at all.</hi> What
ground the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of <hi>Peter,</hi>
hath in theſe three fore-mentioned paſſages of Scripture, from
<hi>Matthew 16. 28. Matthew 16. 19. John</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17. in

               <p>
                  <hi>It is Engliſhed, thus,</hi> Nothing was ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> which was not
ſaid to the other Apoſtles: as it was ſaid unto Peter, What ever thou
ſhalt binde, &amp;c. Was it not alſo ſaid to the reſt, Whom ſoever
ye ſhal binde, &amp;c? And although it was ſaid unto <hi>Peter, Thou
art Peter,</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> be ſignified by the <hi>Rock,</hi> as a ſtone of the

foundation of the Church: then according to <hi>Hieronymus,</hi>
the other Apoſtles were alſo foundation ſtones, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. And
as it was ſaid to <hi>Peter, Feed my Sheep,</hi> nevertheleſs, that
feeding conſiſts in teaching, and example, which is injoyned to
the other Apoſtles alſo, in theſe words, Go ye teaching all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi>And thus much</hi> Cuſanus, <hi>in which words although a</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
<hi>yet he ſhews himſelf a</hi> Proteſtant, <hi>in the expoſition of theſe
places, which are the chief</hi> baſis <hi>of the</hi> Modern Roman faith:
<hi>and he proves his expoſition by Scripture, and Antiquity:
Which is as much to ſay, that in his opinion to wreſt theſe
three paſſages, to prove the</hi> inſtitution of Peter Monarch of
the Church, <hi>is againſt both Scripture, and Antiquity: Yea,
in an other place,</hi> viz. diſt. in novo 24. queſt. 1. <hi>he expreſly
affirms,</hi> That it is moſt certain that <hi>Peter</hi> got no more power
from Chriſt, then the other Apoſtles; <hi>his words are,</hi> Sed

Apoſtalis: <hi>and becauſe they diſtinguiſh</hi> Equality of Order,

That all the Apoſtles had their power immediately from

that ordinar diſtinction of the</hi> Roman Church, viz.

                  <hi>That all the Apoſtles although they had their power imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

<hi>affirming,</hi> What ever Peter was, the other Apostles were
the ſame, of alike power and dignity with him. <hi>And thus much
of theſe three famous paſſages of Scripture,</hi> Matthew 16. 18.

hath recorded ſeveral paſſages in Scripture, expreſly inhibiting,

Their offenſive ſophiſtry, in thoſe three places which we have

both ſides moſt admirable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Adverſaries pretended three arguments, to prove the</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:64826:82"/>
inſtitution of Peters Monarchy of the Church. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe
the Church was built upon him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe the keys
of Heaven were promiſed to him. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe our
Savior directed theſe words to him, Feed my Sheep. <hi>The</hi>
Proteſtants <hi>diſput againſt the ſupremacy of</hi> Peters <hi>inſtitution
by Chriſt, by three arguments alſo. The firſt is, becauſe all</hi>
Domination is forbidden in Church-Officers. <hi>The ſecond
is, becauſe</hi> there is no Head in the Church but only Chriſt.
<hi>The third is becauſe the</hi> Apoſtles puts more perſons then one
in the firſt or higheſt place of the Hierarchy of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt argument, then, is this,</hi> All dominion is forbidden
in the Church, but the inſtitutiou of <hi>Peters</hi> Monarchy of the
Church, or an Oecumenick Biſhop, inferrs domination: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
the office of an Oecumenick Biſhop is forbidden in the Church.
<hi>The</hi> Minor <hi>is proved by</hi> 1. Peter 5. 2. <hi>and</hi> 3. Feed the Flock
of God, which dependeth upon you, caring for it not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint;
but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind:
not as though ye were Lords over Gods heritage, but that ye may
be enſamples to the Flock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanderus, lib. 6. cap.</hi> 1. Of his Monarchy, ſeems to deny the
<hi>Major, viz. That an Oecumenick Biſhop inferrs domination:</hi>
Affirming it inferrs only <hi>Primacy,</hi> but he is abandoned by all

that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath domination (and as ſhal imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
be proved) <hi>Tyranick domination.</hi> And therefore, all
the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> diſtinguiſh, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>Tyranick domination</hi> is only forbidden, 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 5. they deny
that the domination of an Oecumenick Biſhop is Tyranical.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it is replyed, Firſt, that all</hi> domination is forbidden, and

               </p>
               <p>But he is miſtaken: Both theſe <hi>verbs</hi> are uſed promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuouſly
in Scripture for the ſame: both ſignifying <hi>lawful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi>
or <hi>exerciſing dominion lawfully,</hi> as appears by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring,
<hi>Matthew</hi> 20. 25. and <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 42. where the <hi>verb,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſed, ſpeaking how the Kings of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
exerciſe dominion over their Subjects? But, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25.
ſpeaking of the ſame <hi>Lording,</hi> he uſeth the other <hi>Greek verb,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; Whereby it appears that theſe two <hi>Greek verbs</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
both one ſort of ruling which is lawful: and not the
one of them uſed by <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. 5. ſignifyeth <hi>tyrannical domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
Since none will deny, that the ruling, or domination
of the Kings of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> may be lawful domination.
Which is further confirmed, becauſe the <hi>Septuagints,</hi> ſpeaking
of <hi>lawful domination,</hi> in many places uſeth the ſame <hi>Greek
verb,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>It is anſwered, Secondly, Although it were granted, that
<hi>tyrannical domination were only forbidden, Peter</hi> 1. 5. yet it
quite overthrowes an <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> Or the domination

incredible, notwithſtanding that they are the doctrine of the
<hi>Modern Church of Rome,</hi> and particular Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (the
infallibility of which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> with great animoſity endeavors
to demonſtrate, <hi>lib. 4. de Pont. Rom. cap.</hi> 4.) appears by what
followeth, tracing theſe ſix particulars in order.</p>
               <p>And firſt, He aſſumes to himſelf <hi>Infallibility in Cathedra;</hi>
that is, <hi>Teaching the whole Church he cannot err:</hi> which is
moſt <hi>abominable tyranny:</hi> ſince under the pain of Hereſie we are
bound to believe a <hi>Pope,</hi> if he ſhal teach Hereſie. They ſtrive
to elude this, <hi>Becauſe a Pope cannot teach Hereſie</hi> to the whole
Church. Which aſſertion of theirs is falſe, as appears by
theſe following reaſons. Firſt, It is granted by them all, that
<hi>Popes</hi> may be moſt wicked men; yea, and <hi>Magicians.</hi> But
it is madneſs to affirm, that men living in paction with the
Devil, cannot err, teaching the whole Church. Secondly,
It is evident by Hiſtory, and confeſſed by <hi>Barronius</hi> himſelf,
<hi>Anno 538. num.</hi> 20. and <hi>Liberatus, breviar. cap.</hi> 22. that
<hi>Vigilius Biſhop of Rome, obtained that Biſhoprick from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi>
Theodora: <hi>and from</hi> Beliſarius <hi>General to</hi> Juſtinianus
<hi>the Emperor, by promiſing to the Empreſs to caſs and abrogat
the Council of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>to eſtabliſh by authority the Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian
Hereſie, and by promiſing gold to the ſaid</hi> Beliſarius:
<hi>and likewiſe that he wrote ſeveral Epiſtles to ſeveral perſons,
confirming them in the Eutychian Hereſie.</hi> But it is impudence
to deny, that any entring to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> by ſuch
means, can be infallible in teaching the Church. Thirdly,
They who affirm and teach that a <hi>Biſhop of Rome is infallible
in Cathedra,</hi> fights againſt reaſon, common ſenſe, and the
light of all Hiſtory; by which it appears, that ſeveral <hi>Popes</hi>
have not only been condemned by other <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>general
Councils,</hi> for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but alſo for <hi>teaching Hereſie:</hi> Of
which we ſhal give many inſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:64826:83"/>
who was condemned as an Heretick by the ſixth General
Council, <hi>act: 12. &amp;</hi> 13. by the ſeventh General Council in
the laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct. by the eight General Council, <hi>act.</hi> 7. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it appears by the records of the ſaid Councils, that the
ſaid <hi>Honorius</hi> was declared an Heretick, by three Biſhops of
<hi>Rome, Agatho, Leo ſecond,</hi> and <hi>Adrianus ſecond:</hi> and leſt
they think to eſcape this difficulty by diſtinguiſhing (as they
uſe to do in ſuch caſes) that <hi>Honorius taught Hereſie as
a private perſon,</hi> and not <hi>in Cathedra:</hi> It is evident by the 12.
and 13. Act of the ſixth Council, that the ſaid Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
two decretal Epiſtles of the ſaid <hi>Honorius,</hi> as Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
But none will deny that <hi>Popes</hi> in their decretals, <hi>teach
the whole Church. Alphonſus, de caſtro, lib. 1. cap. 4. page</hi> 20.
concluds, <hi>Caleſtinus Biſhop of Rome taught Hereſie, becauſe
he had read Heretical Doctrine, in an old decretal Epiſtle of his:</hi>
Likewiſe of late, <hi>Pope John</hi> 23. was declared an Heretick by
the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4. by the Council of
<hi>Baſil.</hi> By which is ſufficiently proved, <hi>The tyrannical dominion
of the Biſhops of Rome in Spirituals,</hi> ſince all of that Church
are bound to believe that as an Article of Faith which he
teacheth, although he ſhould <hi>teach Hereſie, call good evil, and
evil good:</hi> As appears by that blaſphemous gloſs, <hi>In caput
quanto perſonam de tranſlatione Epiſcopi in decretalibus.</hi> Where
it is affirmed that none ſhould preſume to call in queſtion
what the <hi>Pope</hi> doth? Since he hath an <hi>Heavenly arbitriment,
can change the nature of things, make Juſtice Injustice,
Injustice Juſtice?</hi> Which if it be not tyrannical domination
none is imaginable: the words of the gloſs are theſe following,
<hi>Papa habet coeleſte arbitrium, &amp; ideo naturam rerum mutare; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
ſubſtantialia unius rei applicando alij, &amp; de nullo poſſe aliquid
facere, &amp; ſententiam quae nulla eſt, facere aliquam: in his quae

that he gives pardons for money, for ſins to be committed for

               <p>The ſecond particular of his <hi>tyrannical dominion,</hi> is in <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals.</hi>
Authority of depoſing Kings, is attributed unto him,
it is taught by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power
to abſolve Subjects from their Oaths of fidelity to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

to kill them: that all are oblieged to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him for their natural Prince whom the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhal appoint.
It is taught alſo in that Church, <hi>That the Pope is direct Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of the whole World, both in Spirituals and Temporals.</hi>
So <hi>Bozius, lib. 10. de ſigns Eccleſiae,</hi> and <hi>Carerius de poteſtate
Papae,</hi> and all the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> they teach alſo, <hi>That a Pope depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a King without any reaſon, but his will, doth him no wrong,
becauſe he takes only what is his own from him: As a King
doth no wrong to the Governor of a Province, when he gives
his government to another Subject.</hi> Although the former
have done no offence, as is maintained by <hi>Thomas Bozius, lib.
3. cap 4: de jure ſtatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here our <hi>Romiſh Emiſſaries</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> endeavor
to perſwade their Proſelytes that this doctrine of depoſing
Kings, is not the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but only
of ſome particular Perſons, whom they call the <hi>Popes</hi> Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers.</p>
               <p>But is replyed, that thoſe <hi>Gentle-men</hi> are either not well
verſed in their own principles, or elſe they are like <hi>Father
Cotton</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> who being demanded by the Parliament of
<hi>Paris, If he believed that the Popes had power to depoſe Kings?</hi>
Anſwered, <hi>He did not believe it in</hi> France, <hi>but if he were at</hi>
Rome, <hi>he would believe it.</hi> However that it is to the doctrine of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64826:84"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depoſe Kings;
is proved by theſe following reaſons, which will puzle thoſe
gentlemen very ſore to anſwer. The firſt is this, innumerable
Books are Printed teaching this doctrine, and yet are Printed <hi>by
authority and licence, as containing no doctrine, contrair to the
true Catholick</hi> doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Ergo, <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of Kings by the Pope is the true Catholick doctrine of the
Church of Rome:</hi> ſince a doctrine which is not contrary to the
doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be the
doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is this, All the Roman Doctors unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
maintain, (except ſome few who dare not ſet out their
Head) <hi>that whatever the Pope and his Cardinals diſcern in a
Conclave, is of equal (if not of a Superior) Authority, with that
which is decreed in a General Council;</hi> but the Conclave at <hi>Rome</hi>
gives unto the Pope power of depoſing Kings: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is the
Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> That ſuch power is given
to the Pope by the Conclave, appears by innumerable bulls,
<hi>as that of</hi> Gregory 7. <hi>againſt</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 4. Emperor. <hi>That
of</hi> Paul <hi>the third, againſt</hi> Henry <hi>the 8. of</hi> England. <hi>Of</hi> Paul
<hi>the 5. againſt Queen</hi> Elizabeth. <hi>Of</hi> Sixtus <hi>the 5. againſt</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
3. <hi>and 4. Kings of France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third reaſon is this, Every one is bound to believe that
to be the true Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome, which the Pope
teacheth in Cathedra,</hi> in which caſe they maintain he is infallible;
But the <hi>Pope</hi> teacheth in <hi>Cathedra,</hi> that he hath power <hi>to depoſe
Kings</hi> by his decretal bulls, obliging the whole Church (as is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious)
in which he aſſums to himſelf <hi>that power,</hi> as appears by
innumerable of his Bulls, eſpecially by thoſe now mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Emperor, Kings of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>France:</hi> in which, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
aſſumes unto himſelf authority of <hi>building,</hi> or <hi>aedificandi;
of caſting down,</hi> or <hi>demoliendi; of planting, plantandi; of roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out, eradicandi, transferendi, of transferring, Kingdoms at
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64826:85"/>
his pleaſure.</hi> In ſome of which Bulls alſo, he applyeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
thoſe words of the Prophet, <hi>Per me Reges regnant, By me
Kings reign:</hi> which is notorious blaſphemy. And thus we have
proved, againſt thoſe Gentlemen, that they are miſtaken, in
denying that is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
giveth authority unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> to <hi>depoſe Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are not yet ſatisfied, as appears by two objections,
made by one of thoſe Gentlemen to my ſelf: The firſt was
this, that I could not inſtruct, that it was <hi>the Doctrine of
any General Council, that the</hi> Pope <hi>hath power to depoſe Kings:</hi>
and conſequently I could not make out, it was the doctrine of
the whole Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> To which objection I anſwered
Firſt, that I had made it out, <hi>That it was the doctrine of</hi> Popes
<hi>in Cathedra,</hi> and conſequently I had made it out, <hi>that he and all
other Romanists, were obliged to believe it as an Article of
Faith.</hi> He told me plainly, he did much doubt of that, neither
was he of that opinion, <hi>That the Pope could not err in cathedra,</hi>
but ſtill preſſed me to prove it by the Authority of ſome Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council; proteſting he deteſted that doctrine as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound.
I deſired him to read <hi>Baronius, anno</hi> 1072. and he
would find, <hi>that the</hi> Emperor, Henry <hi>the 4. was exautorated
by a Council at</hi> Rome, <hi>num.</hi> 16, 17, 18. and by another at
<hi>Collen, 1118. num.</hi> 20. and by another at <hi>Fritiſlar, ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gentleman anſwered very pertinently, That theſe
were only petty <hi>particular Councils:</hi> but he deſired the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a <hi>General Council.</hi> I deſired him to read <hi>Baronius, ad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an.
num 1102. num.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and alſo the ſame Author, 1116.
<hi>num.</hi> 5. and alſo <hi>anno</hi> 1119. Where he will find that doctrine
<hi>to be the doctrine of General Councils,</hi> eſpecially, that of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,
anno 1116. is called a General Council by Baronius.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
I deſired him to read <hi>Bzovius, anno 1245. num. 4. The
Council of</hi> Lions, <hi>in the tombs of Councils, tom. 28. pag. 431.
The decretals ſext de ſententiâ &amp; re judicata (ad Apoſtolica;</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:64826:85"/>
where he would find, that the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond
was deprived, or declared to be deprived, and his ſubjects
quit from their <hi>Oaths of Allegiance</hi> by <hi>Innocentius</hi> 4. in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
of <hi>Lions.</hi> I deſired him alſo to read an Act of a General
Council at <hi>Lateran,</hi> under <hi>Innocent third,</hi> where he would
find that doctrine, or that power of <hi>Depoſing Kings,</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the Pope: which Act he would find in <hi>Bzovius, anno</hi>
1215. <hi>Paragraph 3. in Binnius</hi> and <hi>Crab in their collection of
Councils,</hi> C. <hi>l 3. and in Gregorius, de haeret.</hi> C. <hi>excommunicamus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deſired him alſo to read, <hi>Seſ. 25. Canon</hi> 19. of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent,</hi> where he would find that power of the Popes ſo
intelligibly aſſerted, and <hi>conſequentially</hi> (although not expeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
that it was one of the main reaſons for which the Kingdom
of <hi>France</hi> ſtood out againſt that Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> rejecting its
Authority. By the ſaid Canon, any <hi>Dominus fundi is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the Dominion of it, if a düel be fought in it: and ſince a
King is comprehended</hi> under <hi>Dominus fundi,</hi> the Council takes
upon it, <hi>to deprive him of a part of his Kingdom:</hi> but if
they have power to deprive him of a part, by the ſame reaſon,
they take upon them power to take his whole Kingdom
from him. And this way I anſwered his firſt objection, <hi>viz.</hi>
that it could be inſtructed by Act of no Council, <hi>that the
Pope had power to depoſe Kings,</hi> and conſequently it was not the
doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond objection was, that notwithſtanding all this, it
was not the doctrine of the whole Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe
all the Church of <hi>France</hi> rejected it as a pernicious doctrine.</p>
               <p>I anſwered this objection by a two-fold diſtinction. The
firſt of times, <hi>viz. When the King of France was low, and the</hi>
Pope <hi>high.</hi> The ſecond diſtinction was <hi>of cauſes,</hi> wherefore
<hi>Kings are depoſed?</hi> one of which, and the main one was <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi>
I deſired him to read hiſtory, and he would find, that
when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Kings of <hi>France were low, and their Kings ſuſpected of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64826:86"/>
hereſie,</hi> that it was the doctrine of the whole Clergy of <hi>France,</hi>
that the <hi>Pope had power of depoſing ſuch Kings at ſuch times:</hi> for
proving of which, I deſired him to read firſt a <hi>decree of the
Sorbon,</hi> printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> in which they approved the bulls of
<hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. excommunicating and depoſing <hi>Henry</hi> 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. Kings
of <hi>France.</hi> I deſired him ſecondly to read that ſpeech of <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Peron,</hi> in the name of the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> as their Speaker
in an Aſſembly of the Eſtates: in which ſpeech, he openly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<hi>That it is the opinion of the whole Church of</hi> France, <hi>and
ever was, that Heretical Kings</hi> (that is Proteſtants) ought to
<hi>be depoſed: that the Pope had power to depoſe them: and that true
French-men ought them no allegiance.</hi> And thus much of the
Popes power in temporals <hi>by the way:</hi> it ſhal be more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſputed (God willing) <hi>part. 3. lib.</hi> 2 what we have ſaid is
ſufficient to prove, <hi>That the Dominion of the Biſhop of Rome is
tyrannical,</hi> and conſequently, according to their own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
forbidden, <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 5, 3.</p>
               <p>The third particular of the <hi>tyrannical Domination</hi> of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> is <hi>over ſouls departed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth is over</hi> Angels. <hi>Both which uſurpations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the Bull of</hi> Clement <hi>ſixth</hi> proclaiming a Jubile, <hi>The
words of the Bull are theſe,</hi> Concedimus, ſi confeſſus in via
moriatur, ut ab omnibus peccatis ſuis ſit immunis penitus &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutus:
&amp; mandamus Angelis, ut animam è purgatorio penitùs
abſolutam, in Paradiſi gloriam introducant. <hi>And in another
Bull,</hi> Nolumus ut paena inferni illi infligatur, concedens cruce
ſignatis, ad eorum vota tres aut quatuor animas, quas volunt ex
purgatorio poſſe eripere: <hi>in which Bulls he takes upon him
to command Angels, and to</hi> place Souls in heaven or hell as
he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>The 5. particular, proving the tyranny of the dominon of
the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is, <hi>in aſſuming divin power to himſelf:</hi>
So <hi>Nicolaus</hi> 2. in <hi>Gratianus diſt.</hi> 96. (<hi>Satis evidenter.</hi> Where
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64826:86"/>
he affirms, <hi>That the Pope cannot be Judged by any Secular Prince,
becauſe the Pope was called God by</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>but God cannot
be judged by man.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>Bonifacius, 8. 6. decret. de electio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>
C. <hi>fundamenta,</hi> affirms, That <hi>S. Peter was aſſumed in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
of the individual Trinity:</hi> and conſequently, <hi>the Biſhop of
Rome hath the ſame priviledge, as Peters Succeſſor.</hi> So <hi>Gloſſa
extravag.</hi> C. <hi>antiquae de voto.</hi> Where ſpeaking of <hi>Matrimony</hi>
held by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be a <hi>Sacrament of divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;</hi>
a doubt is moved, how that vow made in <hi>Matrimony,</hi>
can be diſſolved by a Conſtitution of the Church? Since it
was made ſolemnly to God. The Gloſſator anſwers the doubt,
That it cannot be made void by <hi>a meer man:</hi> but only by the
<hi>Pope, who is not a meer man, but Gods Vicar.</hi> Thirdly, he
uſurps Divinity in making the <hi>Decretal Epiſtles, or the Canon
law of equal authority with the Scripture.</hi> So <hi>Gratianus, diſtinct.</hi>
19. C. <hi>in Canonicis</hi> expreſly affirms ſo much. Innumerable
examples might be afforded of this kind, but thoſe are ſufficient.</p>
               <p>The ſixth and laſt particular of the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the <hi>Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is, <hi>his hearing, patientiſsimis au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,
without offence, biaſphemous titles attributed to him in
Orations, Books, and Pamphlets</hi> printed by his <hi>Authority:</hi>
which is all one, as he had ſtiled himſelf by thoſe titles. So
by the Gloſs in the Canon Law, he is called <hi>our Lord God the
Pope,</hi> as is found in thoſe Editions printed at <hi>Lions</hi> 1584. and
at <hi>Paris</hi> 1585. 1601. 1612. All which Editions were ſet out
after <hi>Gregory</hi> 13. had corrected the Canon Law: the words
are, <hi>Credere Dominum Deum noſtrum Papam, Conditorem dictae
decretalis, non ſic potuiſse ſtatuere, prout ſtatuit, haereticum cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeatur;
extravagant, John 22. tit. 14. de verb. ſig. cap. 4. &amp;c.</hi>
We could produce innumerable ſuch, but it were tedious; yet
we cannot omit that blaſphemous Pamphlet, preſented to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
the 10. who before his Popedom was called <hi>Cardinal
Pamphilius.</hi> The ſcope of which Pamphlet is to compare the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64826:87"/>
                  <hi>Pope,</hi> whom he calleth <hi>Pamphilius,</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>Philius.</hi> To be ſhort, he preferrs the Pope to Chriſt in
moſt horrible manner: and yet the Pope was no wiſe offended
at that fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ttery: It ſeems, he underſtood not what Blaſphemy
meant; for an other time being deſired to hear a Theological
Controverſie between the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts</hi> diſputed
before him, that he might determin it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He anſwer ed, <hi>He was
an old man, it did not belong to his profeſſion, and he had never
ſtudied Divinity,</hi> as is reported by <hi>S. Amour</hi> in his <hi>journal,</hi>
where he affirms, He heard the Pope affirm ſo publickly. And
thus much of <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 5. 3. The firſt Argument of <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
againſt <hi>Peters</hi> inſtitution of Oecumenick Biſhop, we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
two things in the vindication of that paſſage. The firſt is,
that not only <hi>tyrannical Domination, but all ſort of Domination</hi>
is forbidden in that place. The ſecond is, although it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that only <hi>tyrannical Domination in Church-men were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
in the ſame place:</hi> yet it quite overthrows the inſtitution
of an Oecumenick Biſhop, which we have proved to be <hi>moſt
tyrannical,</hi> and that by ſix arguments, which in effect, amongſt
Candide men are unanſwerable.</p>

               <p>IN the former Chapter we aſſaulted the <hi>Inſtitution of Peter
in that Oecumenick Biſhoprick,</hi> by the teſtimony of <hi>Peter</hi>
himſelf, forbidding all ſort of <hi>Lording</hi> or <hi>Domination</hi> in
<hi>Church men:</hi> where we alſo proved two things. Firſt, that not
only <hi>tyrannical Domination</hi> was forbidden by the Apoſtle in
<hi>Church Rulers,</hi> but <hi>all Domination.</hi> Secondly, although <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64826:87"/>
injunction of the Apoſtle inhibited, <hi>That Lording aſſumed by the

<hi>that the power of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>now-a-dayes, was
not only tyrannical, but blaſphemous, and a right-down Giganto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machy:</hi>
which ſhal more largely be proved, <hi>part. 4. lib.</hi> 1. In
this following chapter, we make uſe of a ſecond <hi>argument</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the inſtitution of <hi>Peter</hi> in that <hi>univerſal Biſhoprick</hi> by
Chriſt: <hi>viz.</hi> it appears by theſe Scriptures mentioned in the
title. <hi>That Chriſt is the Head of the Church:</hi> and if <hi>Peter</hi> were
by divine Inſtitution <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> the Church would
have two heads, ſince our adverſaries maintain, that an Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick
Biſhop <hi>is head of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They anſwer to this difficulty, varying one from another,
ſome one way, ſome another, ſome the third way, others the
fourth. It will not be unpleaſing to examine their Sophiſtry.
The firſt anſwer is of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> diſtinguiſhing: <hi>The Church,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>cannot have two principal Heads, nevertheleſs it may have
two heads, whereof the one is ſubordinat to the other.</hi> In a word
he anſwers, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Caput primarium Eccleſiae, primary head of
the Church, Peter,</hi> and his Succeſſors, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> are
<hi>Capita ſecundaria,</hi> or <hi>ſecundary heads.</hi> But this diſtinction of
<hi>Bellarmins</hi> is both againſt Scripture and Antiquity: It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Scripture, which calling Chriſt <hi>the head of the Church,</hi>
and the <hi>Church the body of Chriſt,</hi> doth ſo by a <hi>Metaphor</hi> taken
from a <hi>humane body:</hi> and, as a humane body cannot have two
heads, one ſubordinat to another, that the ſimilitude may hold,
the Church cannot have two heads.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this plurality of <hi>heads</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> is againſt
Antiquity. <hi>Gregorius Magnus, lib. 4. epiſt. 36. directed to
Eulogius, Biſhop of Alexandria,</hi> exclaims moſt bitterly againſt
<hi>John Biſhop of Conſtantinople,</hi> taking upon him to be <hi>head of
the Church under Chriſt:</hi> neither is it of any moment what ſome
object, <hi>that Gregory doth not inveigh againſt the title it ſelf of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64826:88"/>
Oecumenick Biſhop, but only againſt John Patriarch of</hi> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,
<hi>for uſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ping to himſelf that title, Head of the Church:
which did not belong unto him, but to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, as
Succeſſor to <hi>Peter.</hi> We affirm this ſolution is Black So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry,
becauſe <hi>Gregory</hi> diſputs generally againſt <hi>all who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to take upon them that title, whether Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>or
not,</hi> as appears by his general reaſon. He arguments thus:</p>
               <p>He is proud and arrogant, and a fore-runner of Antichriſt, and
like Lucifer, exalting himſelf above the other Angels, who
takes upon him that which is proper to Chriſt, or belongs to Chriſt
only.</p>
               <p>But he who takes upon him to be head of the Church, takes
that upon him which belongs only to Chriſt: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which reaſoning of <hi>Gregorius,</hi> it is evident, that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puts
againſt all who take upon them to be <hi>ſecundary heads of
the Church, Biſhop of</hi> Rome, and all: his reaſon militats no
leſs againſt the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> then againſt him of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople:</hi>
and in his 38. <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> he ingeminats the ſame reaſon,
<hi>viz. That thoſe who take upon them to be Head of the Church
under</hi> Chriſt, <hi>will not be able to hold up their face at the laſt day:
becauſe in ſo doing, they took upon them that title which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only to Chriſt:</hi> which title alſo, <hi>Gregory</hi> in ſeveral other of
his <hi>Epiſtles, calls new, Blaſphemous, againſt the mandats of
Chriſt, Canons of the Apoſtles, Conſtitutions of the Church, &amp;c.</hi>
Which teſtimonies of <hi>Gregory</hi> ſhal be examined hereafter, and
vindicated from the ſophiſtries of <hi>Bellarmin, Baronius,</hi> and
others.</p>
               <p>This ſecundary head, is alſo aſſaulted by <hi>Baſilius</hi> in <hi>Aſceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
in the <hi>Prooem,</hi> where he calls Chriſt <hi>the only head of the
Church.</hi> And thus ye have the opinion of <hi>Baſilius,</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius,</hi>
both called <hi>the Great,</hi> that a <hi>Secundary Head</hi> of the
Church, is an Antichriſtian fiction, ſince they thunder ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it in the perſon of any one man: none can be ſo ignorant,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64826:88"/>
as to think, that <hi>Gregorious</hi> exclaimed againſt <hi>John,</hi> for taking
on him that title of <hi>caput primarium: Ergo,</hi> the thing he diſputs
againſt, is that <hi>caput ſecundarium, defended now by Bellarmin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> nevertheleſs diſputs for that <hi>ſecundary head,</hi>
three wayes. Firſt, becauſe it is no wayes <hi>injurious to
Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, becauſe it <hi>illuſtrats the glory of Chriſt.</hi>
Thirdly, becauſe <hi>it is neceſſar to the Church.</hi> Let us hear
how he pleads? And firſt, how he proves it <hi>is not contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious
to Chriſt?</hi> His argument is this, Many <hi>titles of Chriſt</hi>
are communicated to men, ſuch as <hi>Paſtor, Biſhop, Apoſtle, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
Light, Foundation:</hi> Yea, and the <hi>title of God himſelf;</hi>
and yet no injury is done to Chriſt, when men are called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
Paſtors, Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Gods, &amp;c. Ergo,</hi> no injury is
done to Chriſt, when a man is called <hi>Head of the Church under
Him.</hi> And conſequently, a <hi>ſecundary Head of the Church</hi>
is no wayes contrair to Scripture.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, Firſt, we have warrand in Scripture
for theſe other titles, attributed to both Chriſt and men: but
we have no warrand in Scripture to call any man <hi>Head of the
Church.</hi> By which it appears, that our Savior hath reſerved
that title to himſelf alone. It is great preſumption in any
man to take upon him that title belonging to Chriſt, without
any warrand. Secondly, thoſe other titles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to men,
which are attributed to Chriſt principally, may be compared
to thoſe <hi>titles,</hi> which are common to a King, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
Some of which without any derogation to the King
at all, may be communicated to the Subject: as <hi>Noble, Rich,
Powerful, Lord, Magistrat, &amp;c.</hi> But none of the <hi>Subjects</hi>
can be called <hi>Kings.</hi> Juſt ſo, in theſe titles common to Chriſt
with men, no wrong is done to Chriſt, when they are called
<hi>Lights, Foundations, Apoſtles, Doctors, Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> But the title
of <hi>head of the church</hi> can no more be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munictaed to a man, then
the title of a King to a ſubject. <hi>Head of the church</hi> is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64826:89"/>
of Chriſt, Thirdly, thoſe other titles objected by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi>
common to Chriſt &amp; other men, are not properly attributed to
both: but <hi>properly</hi> to the one, &amp; <hi>Figuratively</hi> or <hi>Metaphorically</hi>
to the other: So theſe titles which are properly attributed
to Chriſt, are attributed to men improperly, and <hi>ſecundum
homonymiam.</hi> And again, theſe titles that are <hi>proper</hi> to men,
are in the ſame manner <hi>improperly</hi> attributed to Chriſt: But
<hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and his Fellows maintain, that the title of <hi>Head of
the Church</hi> belongs properly both to Chriſt, and men, as
the title of a <hi>King</hi> properly belongs to both. Now let us
examine thoſe titles objected by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> more particularly.</p>
               <p>And Firſt, <hi>Paſtor, Apoſtle, Biſhop, Prophet,</hi> theſe titles are
attributed to men, without auy injury to Chriſt: becauſe
theſe titles belong properly to men, and from them tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Chriſt: and ſince our Savior demits himſelf voluntarily,
to theſe titles, it is no injury to him, though they be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to him, <hi>Metaphorically</hi> and <hi>Abuſively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, are <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Foundation,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to an <hi>Homonymy</hi> are attributed to Chriſt and to men.
And firſt, <hi>Light,</hi> if it were attributed to them both proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the aſſertion of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would be falſe, affirming,
<hi>That John Baptiſt was not the Light, but only Chriſt;</hi> by
whom it appears alſo, that Chriſt was called the <hi>Light,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he illuminats; men are called <hi>Lights</hi> becauſe they are <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated.</hi>
So <hi>Cyrillus, Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtinus</hi>
upon the place: which laſt affirms, that the Apoſtle called our
<hi>Savior the true Light, becauſe he was that Light which illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats:
men were only called Lights, becauſe they were illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him, and therefore are not the true Lights:</hi> And ſince
Chriſt is the <hi>true Light,</hi> and men are not the <hi>true Lights;</hi> it
is evident, that the title of <hi>Light</hi> is attributed to both by a
<hi>Homonymy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place comes <hi>Foundation, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:64826:89"/>
are called <hi>Foundations</hi> two wayes. And firſt, <hi>Tertullianus,
lib. 4. cap.</hi> 39. againſt <hi>Marcion, Chryſoſtomus, Oecumenius,
Theophylactus,</hi> interpret theſe words of <hi>Paul, ſuper fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
Prophetarum &amp; Apoſtolorum,</hi> as if the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
themſelves were <hi>Foundations:</hi> But it is certain they cannot be
called ſo, but only by reaſon of their <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> that is, in ſo
far as they were <hi>Miniſters of founding Churches,</hi> as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
by <hi>Juſtinianus</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> who affirms, That the faith of
the <hi>Epheſians was built upon the teſtimony of the Old and New
Teſtament,</hi> that is by a <hi>Metonymy;</hi> but Chriſt is not that way
called <hi>Foundation:</hi> and therefore the title of <hi>Foundation</hi> is
attributed by a <hi>Homonymy</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi>
and in that ſenſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> denyeth that there
is any <hi>Foundation</hi> but Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Others interpret the meaning of <hi>Paul,</hi> calling the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
and <hi>Prophets, Foundations</hi> to be that they <hi>preached the
Doctrine of the Old and New Teſtament, which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Apoſtles and Prophets; viz. which they did lay.</hi> So
the interlinear and ordinar gloſs, following <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> and
<hi>Anſelmus:</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Lyranus, Aquinas, Lombardus, Cajetanus,
Gagnaeus</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and <hi>Salmero.</hi> In what ever ſenſe
<hi>Foundation</hi> be taken, it is properly attributed to Chriſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
by a <hi>Homonymy</hi> to men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmins</hi> laſt tittle is <hi>GOD:</hi> Men are called <hi>Gods,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 82. and ſince they are ſo called, why may not a man
be called <hi>Head of the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered: Firſt, <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> are not called
<hi>Gods</hi> there, but only that <hi>men judged ſo of them,</hi> becauſe of
their flouriſhing eſtate: ſo that, <hi>Fgo dixi, Dii eſtis,</hi> are not the
words of <hi>GOD,</hi> but of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> himſelf, as d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vers learned
men gather from the text. Others think that the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> is
ſpeaking of the <hi>Angels.</hi> However, albeit the title of <hi>GOD</hi> were
attributed to <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Judges;</hi> it doth not follow, that the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64826:90"/>
title of <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> may be attributed to men: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the title of <hi>GOD</hi> is attributed to men <hi>abuſively,</hi> by a
too high ſtrained <hi>Metaphor:</hi> But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and his fellows
endeavor to maintain that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome is properly head
of the Church, as a King is head of his Kingdom:</hi> And in this
manner <hi>Bellarmin</hi> undertakes to prove, that it is not injurious
to Chriſt, that any ſhould take upon him the title of <hi>Head of
the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the next place, he goes a ſtep higher, endeavoring to
prove,</hi> That a viſible head of the Church, ſets forth the glory
of Chriſt, as the glory of a King is augmented by a Victory.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, When a <hi>Viceroy</hi> intruds himſelf without
a Commiſſion upon a Province; he is ſo far from ſetting
forth the glory of his King, that he eclipſeth it, by neglecting
of his authority, and proves a Rebel. Let <hi>Bellarmin</hi> inſtruct
if he can, in what place of Scripture, any hath commiſſion to be
<hi>viſible head of the Church under Chriſt?</hi> We proved in the
former chapters, that what he alledged in the behalf of <hi>Peter,</hi>
was new deviſed <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> contradicting <hi>Scripture, Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and of no great moment, to prove the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter,</hi>
in the opinion of the moſt learned Antiquaries, which ever the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> produced. Secondly, <hi>Bellarmins viſible
head of the Church,</hi> carrys himſelf not like a <hi>Viceroy,</hi> but
like a King, which muſt be injurious to the <hi>true Head of the
Church:</hi> Yea, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf endeavors to prove, that the
<hi>ſaid ſecondary head reigns in the Church, as a King doth in a
Kingdom:</hi> Neither can the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> be ſaid to be <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi>
to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> otherwiſe in the government of the Church,
then a King is <hi>Viceroy</hi> to GOD, in the government of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
But Kings are abſolute, and not <hi>Viceroys,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that <hi>viſible head of the Church</hi> is abſolute alſo, being
ſubordinate no otherwiſe to Chriſt, then Kings are to GOD.
Thirdly, when a <hi>Viceroy</hi> takes upon him to go beyond his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64826:90"/>
commiſſion, or to govern contrair to the law of his King, he
wrongs the authority of his King, and no wayes ſets forth his
glory. But <hi>Bellarmins viſible and ſecundary head</hi> takes upon
him, to diſpence with the Law of GOD (as we ſhewed in
the former chapter) proving that he took power upon him, to
<hi>make Juſtice Injuſtice, and Injuſtice Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> goes a ſtep higher yet, and
endeavors to prove that a <hi>ſecundary viſible head</hi> is neceſſar for
the Church: becauſe, ſaith he, in the abſence of Chriſt, <hi>the
Church cannot be contained in Vnity, unleſs it be governed
by one viſible head under Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, <hi>Stillgood:</hi> that aſſertion of <hi>Bellarmins,</hi>
if not <hi>blaſphemous,</hi> is notoriouſly falſe: <hi>viz. That the Church
cannot be contained in Vnity by Chriſt alone, unleſs a viſible
head be joyned with him:</hi> Which contradicts Scripture, which
in every place attributes the cauſe of that Unity, of the <hi>Church
to Chriſt alone:</hi> So <hi>John 17. That they may be one in us,</hi> and
Rom. 10. <hi>We many are one body in Chriſt:</hi> and Gal. 3. <hi>Ye
are all one in Christ;</hi> and the reaſon is evident, becauſe that
Unity is Spiritual, <hi>Epheſ. 4. Studying to keep the unity of
the Spirit;</hi> See alſo 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. and <hi>Philip</hi> 1. By which
places it appears, that the Inviſible and Spiritual preſence of
Chriſt alone, preſerves the Church in Unity, which is alſo
granted by many &amp; famous <hi>Roman Doctors,</hi> who prove the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the Church, to depend upon this promiſe of
Chriſt, <hi>viz. That he would be preſent with them to the end of
the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have heard <hi>Bellarmin</hi> diſputing for a <hi>viſible head,</hi> and
proving that it is not <hi>derogatory to the honor of Chriſt:</hi> We
will now examine an argument of <hi>Sanderus,</hi> that famous
<hi>Engliſh Jeſuite,</hi> who proves, that it conduceth to the glory of
Chriſt, that the Church ſhould have a <hi>viſible head:</hi> becauſe,
ſaith he, <hi>More ways of Preaching that glory of Chriſt, are by a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64826:91"/>
viſible head then without it.</hi> But it is anſwered, (to omit the
inconſequence of that argument) we deny the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
or diſtinguiſheth it, <hi>viz.</hi> Theſe ways of Preaching Chriſt,
only illuſtrat his glory which are ordained by himſelf: which
a <hi>viſible head</hi> is not. <hi>Sanderus</hi> inſtances, Rulers of particular
Churches, or Biſhops, are called <hi>Heads</hi> of their reſpective
Churches under Chriſt, by <hi>Gregorius Magnus</hi> and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> why may there not be one <hi>viſible head of all
the Church under Chriſt?</hi> But it is anſwered, Firſt, if <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus</hi>
had objected that argument to <hi>Gregorius Magnus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he would have denyed it to follow: for although he
ſeems to call <hi>Biſhops heads of particular Churches,</hi> yet he
deteſts an <hi>univerſal head</hi> (as we ſhewed before) <hi>as injurious
to Christ.</hi> Secondly, when <hi>Gregorius</hi> calls <hi>Biſhops heads of the
Church,</hi> he ſpeaks <hi>abuſively</hi> and <hi>improperly,</hi> and without any
warrand in Scripture.</p>
               <p>And thus we have ſhewed hitherto, how <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus</hi>
have endeavored to prove, that it is not inconſiſtent with
the Church, to have <hi>two heads:</hi> becauſe, the one is a <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
head,</hi> the other <hi>a Secundary head. Panigarola, lectione</hi> 6.
uſeth a very ſtrange argument, to prove, that the Church of
neceſſity, muſt have a <hi>viſible head</hi> beſide <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Otherwiſe,
ſaith he, <hi>It would be a monſter, if a viſible body as the
Church had only an inviſible head, which is Chriſt.</hi> But it is
anſwered: Firſt, the Church will be no leſs a monſter, if it
have <hi>two heads;</hi> one <hi>viſible,</hi> another <hi>inviſible.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigarola</hi>
ſpeaks blaſphemy, which we bind upon him by this
argument: Firſt, <hi>All bodies viſible, having an inviſible head
are monſtrous bodies.</hi> This <hi>Panigarola</hi> grants. Secondly, <hi>The
Church is no monſtrous body.</hi> This he grants alſo: how can he
then deny this concluſion in <hi>Baroco: Ergo, The Church hath
not an inviſible head, or Chriſt is not head of the Church,</hi> which
is right-down blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:64826:91"/>
                  <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro,</hi> puzled with the difficulty of two
<hi>heads,</hi> hath a diſtinction of his own, of <hi>two bodies:</hi> as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
made a diſtinction of <hi>two heads. De Caſtro,</hi> denies <hi>That
body of which Chriſt is the head, to be the ſame with that body
which hath a viſible head, or Peter, or the Biſhop of Rome for
its head.</hi> He explains himſelf thus, the Church may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a body two ways, ſaith he. Firſt, as it is a <hi>total body.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
as it is a <hi>Myſtical body.</hi> The firſt way is, when it is
conſidered, comprehending all the <hi>Members</hi> with Chriſt: and
in that ſenſe, <hi>Chriſt is head of the Church.</hi> In the ſecond way
it is conſidered, <hi>as a body conſiſting of all the other members
(Chriſt excluded</hi>) and in that acception, <hi>Peter</hi> or his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
are <hi>viſible heads of the Church:</hi> So the Church cannot
be ſaid to have <hi>two heads;</hi> for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> and his <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
are not heads of the ſame body, but of diverſe.</hi> Chriſt
is head of the Church, as it is a <hi>total body, Peter,</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
as it is a <hi>Myſticalbody.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtre</hi> (as cannot be denyed)
was a brave learned man, and ſtood as little awe of the <hi>Pope,</hi>
to ſpeak his mind when truth required, as any Doctor of that
Church: yet this diſtinction of his of a <hi>body in total,</hi> and <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical,</hi>
is uſed by no body but himſelf: it is alſo contrair to
Scripture, which in every place, <hi>where the Church is called
the body of Chriſt,</hi> conſiders it, <hi>as containing all other members,
Chriſt excluded:</hi> And ſo the Scripture never mentions that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which <hi>de Caſtro</hi> calls a <hi>total body.</hi> For the Scripture,
<hi>calling the Church the body of Chriſt,</hi> means no other body,
then that which <hi>de Caſtro</hi> calls <hi>myſtical.</hi> This diſtinction of <hi>de
Caſtro</hi> might be ſolidly refuted otherwiſe; but it is needleſs
to inſiſt, ſince it is owned by no others, except by <hi>Spondanus,</hi>
who ſeems to come very near it thus.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith he, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. affirms <hi>Chriſt to be the
head from which the whole body takes increment.</hi> He obſerveth,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64826:92"/>
Firſt, that Chriſt is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>whole body,</hi> which
is the Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſaith he, ſince the Church is a <hi>whole
body without Chriſt, it muſt of neceſſity have a head beſide
Chriſt, otherways it could not be a whole body,</hi> ſince no <hi>body</hi>
can be whole without a <hi>head.</hi> And therefore the Church hath
a <hi>viſible head,</hi> proportionable to it ſelf beſide Chriſt, ſince it
is a whole body without Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it is anſwered, He is a notorious Sophiſter: Firſt, when
the Apoſtle,</hi> Epheſians 4. oppoſeth the whole body to Chriſt,
<hi>under the name of</hi> body, <hi>or</hi> whole body, he comprehends all the
other members only, beſide the head, and not as having a head
of its own: <hi>As appears by the</hi> Commentaries <hi>not only of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
upon that place,</hi> Epheſ. 4. <hi>ſuch as</hi> Chryſoſtom, <hi>and
his admirer</hi> Theophylactus, <hi>and</hi> Theodoretus, <hi>but alſo by the
expoſitions of</hi> Juſtinian <hi>and</hi> Salmero <hi>two famous</hi> Jeſuites,
<hi>upon that place,</hi> Epheſians 4. <hi>All which, expounding what the
Apoſtle calls,</hi> totum corpus, <hi>or,</hi> the whole body, <hi>interpret it
to be theſe members,</hi> Quae à capite ſenſum accipiunt, <hi>or,</hi> have
influence of ſenſe, or life from the head: <hi>And conſequently,
they make</hi> totum corpus, the whole body, <hi>to be no otherthing,</hi>
then all the other members, the head excluded: <hi>and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</hi>
totum corpus, the whole body, <hi>hath not an other</hi> head
<hi>beſide</hi> Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, By</hi> totum corpus, or whole body, <hi>queſtionleſs
the Apoſtle means the</hi> Church, <hi>as it comprehends both the</hi>
Church Militant, <hi>and the</hi> Church Triumphant. Spondanus
<hi>argument, if it conclude at all, muſt of neceſſity conclude, that</hi>
the ſaid viſible head is head of the Church Triumphant: <hi>and ſo
the</hi> Biſhop of Rome, muſt be head of the Church Triumphant
<hi>alſo which none will affirm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ground of this diſtinction of <hi>Spondanus,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
falſe, <hi>viz, That the head would not be proportional
to the body, except it were viſible.</hi> For to omit that Chriſt is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64826:92"/>
conſtantly <hi>called the Head of the Church in Scripture,</hi> which
ſhould be enough to ſtop the mouth of <hi>Spondanus;</hi> our Savior
is a <hi>proportional Head to the Church,</hi> becauſe, <hi>he is a man like
unto us in all things, except ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We will conclude this diſput</hi> of Head of the Church <hi>with one
Argument, uſed by ſome Proteſtants againſt a</hi> Viſible Head of
the Church; <hi>which is this,</hi> If the Church had any other Head
but Chriſt, it would be called the body of the ſaid Head: <hi>but it
is never called</hi> the body of any Head, but of Chriſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It hath
no other Head but Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> anſwers two wayes: And firſt he affirms, That
the Church is not <hi>called the body of that viſible Head,</hi> becauſe
it is only <hi>Secundary,</hi> and not <hi>Primary:</hi> and therefore, the Church
is only <hi>called the body of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is replyed, If there were any ſuch thing, as that <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary
head,</hi> the Church could with no leſs reaſon be called <hi>its
body,</hi> then it could be called <hi>head of the church.</hi> Since the relation
is reciprocal, and the body is no leſs the body of the Head, then
the head is the head of the body: and ſince the Church is no
where called the body of that <hi>ſecundary head,</hi> it is evident,
that the ſaid ſecundary head is a fiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> urgeth, that a King is the Head of his Kingdom,
and the Kingdom may be called his body: likewiſe, a <hi>Viceroy</hi>
may be called <hi>ſecundary Head</hi> of the Kingdom or Province:
but the Kingdom or Province, cannot be called the body of a
<hi>Viceroy,</hi> and in like manner, the Church cannot be called <hi>the
body of that ſecundary Head,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is replyed, As <hi>the Viceroy is head of the Province,</hi> ſo
the Province may be called <hi>the body or Province of the Viceroy:</hi>
but ſince the Church cannot be called <hi>the body of that ſecundary
head,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſeth, it is evident, there is no ſuch
ſecundary head at all in the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants, that the <hi>Kingdom may be called
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64826:93"/>
the body or Kingdom of the King:</hi> but he endeavors to prove,
that the <hi>ſaid ſecundary head reigns in the Church, as a King doth
in a Kingdom:</hi> and therefore the Church may be called the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the ſaid ſecundary head, if there were any ſuch thing. But
ſince the Church is no where called the <hi>body of that ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
head,</hi> it is evident, that the ſaid ſecundary head is a meer
fiction. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> gives a reaſon, wherefore the Province is
not called the body of the <hi>Viceroy?</hi> but only of the King, <hi>viz.</hi>
becauſe the Governor of a Province is not <hi>perpetual,</hi> but only
<hi>for a time.</hi> And for the ſame reaſon, the Church is not called
the body of that ſecundary head, becauſe it is not <hi>perpetual,</hi> but
only for <hi>a time.</hi> But this reaſon is frivolous, becauſe, that <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary
head of the Church</hi> is as perpetual, as a King in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
and therefore the Church may be called as well body of
that <hi>ſecundary head,</hi> as a Kingdom is called <hi>the body of a King.</hi>
But ſince in Scripture, the Church is no where called the body
of that ſecundary Head; it is evident, it is a fiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>ſecundary head,</hi> which is further confirmed. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms
alſo, That the Province cannot be ſaid to be the Province of
the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> becauſe he is not <hi>abſolute:</hi> but it may be called
the Province of the King, becauſe he is <hi>abſoluto,</hi> and depends
upon none but God. But that <hi>ſecundary head of the Church</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon none but Chriſt: and therefore the Church may as
well be called <hi>his body,</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> as a Kingdom may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Kingdom of the King.</hi> But ſince the Church is no where cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
body of that ſecundary head, it is evident, that the ſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary
head is but a fiction.</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>ies to another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the Church is called the body of Chriſt,

                  </gap>e is referred to
Chriſt, <hi>as a great hypoſtaſis:</hi> as when <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> is lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64826:93"/>
and all,</hi> and is not conſidered, as diſtinct from the Head and
other members.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> by this device doth not take away the difficulty,
for two reaſons. The firſt is, although it were granted that the
Church were called the body of Chriſt, as the word <hi>Christ</hi> is
a <hi>Hypoſtaſis, comprehending both heads and members:</hi> in which
ſenſe, the body of <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul may be called their body,</hi> and
not their <hi>head;</hi>—we ſay, Although that were granted, yet
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> will not deny, that the Church is called the body
of Chriſt, ſometimes, <hi>as it is referred to Chriſt as head:</hi> and
therefore, if there were any <hi>Secundary head, the Church would
be called its bodie in that reſpect alſo:</hi> which ſince it is not,
it is evident, that there is no ſuch thing as a <hi>ſecundary head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is, that it is falſe which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms,
that ever the Church is called the body of Chriſt, in that ſenſe
of <hi>great hypoſtaſis:</hi> it hath neither ground in Scripture, nor
Antiquity: it is only deviſed by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, who abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
Scripture, and a paſſage of <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> to prove it. The
place of Scripture is 1 <hi>Corinth. 12. verſe</hi> 12. Where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
affirms, <hi>That all the members of the bodie, although they
be many, yet are but one bodie, even ſo is Chriſt:</hi> which makes
nothing for him; for the Apoſtle there means no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch thing, as
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms, citing <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> falſly to prove it. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtins</hi>
words are, <hi>Non dixit ita &amp; Chriſti, ideſt, corpus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti,

if that had been the Apoſtles mind, that the Church is
called the body of Chriſt, as the body of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> lying

That the Government of the Church was monarchical, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of the Apoſtles, delineating the Hierarchy of the Church, put e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>
                  <hi>And firſt, the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, Epheſ. 4. <hi>enumerating the</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie

               </p>
               <p>Bellarmin <hi>anſwers two wayes. One way is, that the Apoſtle
in thoſe words,</hi> is not delineating the Hierarchy of the Church:
<hi>but only</hi> enumerating divers gifts of ſome of the Church, <hi>and</hi>
1 Corinthians 12. he adds the gift of tongues.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, It cannot be denyed, but the Apoſtle is
<hi>enumerating diverſity of gifts;</hi> ſince <hi>verſe</hi> 7. He expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
ſo much, but it is to be added, <hi>that he enumerats
thoſe gifts, as they are in Officers of the Church only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> whence
appears the diſſimilitude of this place from 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. In

Rulers, but are alſo found in laiks:</hi> Such as <hi>gifts of healing, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64826:95"/>
tongues, &amp;c.</hi> That this is the Apoſtles meaning, appears by
two reaſons. Firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he enumerats none, <hi>verſe 11. Who hath not
a degree of ruling in the Church.</hi> The ſecond is, becauſe <hi>ver.</hi> 12.
13, 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He doth not enumerat any utility redounding to the
Church, which is not wrought by the Miniſtry, <hi>ver. 11. He
enumerats the Miniſters of the Church, ver.</hi> 12. 13, &amp; 14. <hi>He
enumerats the ends wherefore theſe Miniſters were ordained:</hi> All
which ends, <hi>Oecumentus</hi> comprehends under one, that is, ſaith
he, <hi>Thoſe degrees of Miniſters enumerated, verſe 12. were for
that end ordained, that they might miniſter unto the Church,</hi> as
appears, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, &amp; 14.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that the Apoſtle enumerats here all
Church Officers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both <hi>extraordinar</hi> and <hi>ordinar.</hi> The <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinar</hi>
are thoſe <hi>who were ordained only to continue for a time:</hi>
Such as <hi>Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Prophets. Ordinar,</hi> are thoſe
<hi>ordained to be of perpetual ſtanding in the Church:</hi> as <hi>Doctors,</hi>
and <hi>Paſtors.</hi> And ſince in all thoſe Orders of Church Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
there are many, and not one only in each degree: it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that one <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> or a <hi>viſible head of the Church,</hi>
is not comprehended under any of thoſe <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bellarmin <hi>puzled with this anſwers another way. He
grants,</hi> that the enumeration of Church Miniſters here is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:

repreſented under the name of Paſtors and Doctors: <hi>But finding
that</hi> Paſtors <hi>and</hi> Doctors <hi>were only inferior Orders, below,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
Prophets <hi>and</hi> Evangeliſts. <hi>He paſſeth from this, and
affirms next, That an</hi> Oecumenick Biſhop <hi>is comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
Apoſtles: <hi>becauſe, not only here, but alſo</hi> 1 Corinth 12.
Apoſtles <hi>are put in the firſt place: and therefore the chief Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick
Power was given to all the</hi> Apoſtles; <hi>but to</hi> Peter, <hi>as</hi>
ordinar Paſtor: <hi>and therefore to have a</hi> Succeſſor <hi>in it, to the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64826:95"/>
other Apoſtles, as</hi> exraordinar <hi>and</hi> Delegats to Peter: <hi>and
therefore none ſhould ſucceed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, we prolixly diſputed this diſtinction of
<hi>Bellarmins</hi> to be groundleſs, contradictory and inconſiſtent
with it ſelf, <hi>cap.</hi> 6. It is needleſs to repeat what we ſaid there
in this place. It is ſufficient here, that never any ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Interpreter before the times of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> did ſo much
as dream, that an Oecumenick Biſhop was comprehended by
the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. Which could be made out by an
Induction of all the Commentaries, of ancient and Modern
Writers upon that place. By which it appears, that all thoſe
teſtimonies by which thoſe <hi>Jeſuits</hi> prove the Supremacy of
<hi>Peter,</hi> (and conſequently the verity of the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi>) are
either in Scripture or Fathers, depraved by new deviſed Gloſſes
unknown to the Ancients: and alſo their anſwers, are of the
ſame ſtuff, by which they elude paſſages of Scripture and
Antiquity, deſtroying the Monarchy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and in it the whole edifice of the Roman Church. Both their
offenſive and defenſive arms, are but deviſed of late, ſince the
tyranny of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>That any may ſee, that this Gloſs of <hi>Bellarmins,</hi> is a fiction
of his own deviſing, we will prove by three Arguments, of
three ſeveral Interpreters. By which it will appear, what was
the opinion of the Church, concerning the meaning of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<hi>Epheſ</hi> 4. 11. ſince the times of the Apoſtles unto thoſe
dayes?</p>
               <p>The firſt Interval is of the Primitive Church, before the
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> what was the opinion of that Church in that
Interval? appears by the teſtimony of the ancient Author
(<hi>by ſome believed to be Dionyſius Areopagita, the diſciple of
Paul</hi>) his words, <hi>epiſtle</hi> 8. are thoſe: <hi>Tu ergo cupiditati, ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundiae,</hi>

things. The firſt is, <hi>That the chief place in the Hierarchy, in the
times of the Apoſtles,</hi> was held not by one, but by many, <hi>viz.</hi>
by all the Apoſtles alike: neither makes he mention of <hi>Peter,

Apostles, as having it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Delegats to Peter:</hi> which will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confirmed by the ſecond thing obſervable in theſe words,
which is this: After the Apoſtles were removed, the chief
place in the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> conſiſted alſo not in one perſon, but in
many alike, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who ſucceeded to the Apoſtles in
the firſt place of the <hi>Hierarchie:</hi> which alſo he expreſly affirms
to be of <hi>equal Order and Juriſdiction: many and not one having
Juriſdiction over all, as a viſible head:</hi> which quite deſtroyes
the Gloſs of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> for if others ſucceeding to the other
Apoſtles, were in the firſt place of the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> (which this
Author flatly affirms) it is falſe which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms, that all
the Apoſtles had the chief power, <hi>only during their own time,</hi>
not <hi>communicable to their Succeſſors.</hi> And likewiſe, if thoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
of the other Apoſtles, were in the firſt place of the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,</hi>
equally and alike, (as this Author alſo affirms) It is
falſe, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms, <hi>That the Succeſſors of</hi> Peter <hi>the
Apoſtle, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he chief authority in their ſingle perſons, as viſible
Monarchs of the Church.</hi> It may be proved by the Gloſſes of
<hi>Maximus,</hi> and others, that this <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was not the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Acts,</hi> becauſe, he
ſeems <hi>to make mention of the Metropolitants, above Biſhops.</hi> But
it ſhal be proved, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. by unanſwerable teſtimonies, <hi>That
there was no Office above that of a Biſhop in the Church, before
the latter end of the third age.</hi> However, albeit he be not the
Diſciple of <hi>Paul,</hi> (as ſome affirm he is) yet he is an ancient
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64826:96"/>
Author, and delineats, <hi>the Hierarchie of the Church, not to have
been monarchical in his days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond teſtimony, is of <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> who l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ved in that

time <hi>Bonifacius third,</hi> was made (firſt of all the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome) univerſal Biſhop</hi> by an Edict of the Emperor <hi>Phocas.</hi>
The words of <hi>Ambroſius</hi> are, <hi>Apoſtoli ſunt Epiſcopi, nam
in Epiſcopo omnes ordines ſunt, quia primus ſacerdos eſt, hoc
eſt, Princeps Sacerdotum, &amp; Propheta &amp; Evangeliſta, &amp; ad
caetera adimplenda officia Eccleſiae in Miniſterio fidelium.</hi> In
which words he is ſhewing, what Church-Rulers in his own
time were anſwerable to, or repreſented theſe mentioned by <hi>Paul
Eheſ.</hi> 4. 11. And he affirms, That Biſhops ſucceeded to the
Apoſtles, in the firſt place of the <hi>Hierarchie (Apoſtoli ſunt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopi,</hi> ſaith he,) in which words he expreſly affirms, That
the chief place in the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> in his own time, (which was
the latter end of the 4. Age) was in <hi>many,</hi> and not in <hi>one, viz.</hi>
in <hi>Biſhops</hi> who anſwered to the <hi>Apostles:</hi> And conſequently,
he contradicts this gloſs of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who affirms that the
<hi>Succeſſors of Peter</hi> (and not of the other Apoſtles) <hi>only ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in the firſt place of Hierarchie, as Monarchs of the
Church.</hi> One <hi>Tenebrio</hi> or an other (whoſe name I have forgot,
and alſo where I read it) intends to prove by theſe words of
<hi>Ambroſius</hi> an Oecumenick Biſhop, becauſe <hi>Ambroſius</hi> makes
mention of theſe words, of <hi>Primus Socerdos,</hi> and <hi>Princeps Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotum,
that is of firſt Prieſt and Prince of Prieſts.</hi> But any
(if not altogether ſtupid, or elſe intending to deceive)
may perceive, that it is far from the meaning of <hi>Ambroſius,</hi>
his words are, <hi>Biſhops ſucceed to the Apoſtles, or anſwer to the

               <p>The third teſtimony is of <hi>Anſelmus,</hi> who lived in the 11.

theſe mentioned by <hi>Paul, Epheſ,</hi> 4. 11? In which he num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
the Apoſtle <hi>Pettr, Andrew, &amp;c.</hi> To which now-adays,
ſaith he, <hi>Anſwers Primats, and Patriarchs, or Arch-Biſhops,</hi>
which quite deſtroys the gloſs of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> ſince he makes
<hi>many in the firſt place of the Hierarchie, and doth not dream,
that the other Apoſtles were delegats to</hi> Peter, <hi>and had the firſt
place in the Hierarchie, for that reaſon not communicable to
their ſucceſſors.</hi> And thus we have proved, that the firſt place
of the Hierarchie, <hi>Jur. divino,</hi> was not in one ſingle perſon,
which we have demonſtrated by Scripture and Antiquity:
And conſequently, that <hi>Peter</hi> was not ordained by our Savior
Monarch of the Church, which was our third argument. Theſe
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> anſwers the teſtimonies of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
calling; <hi>All Biſhops alike, or all Biſhops High-Prieſts,</hi> by
diſtinguiſhing equality in that of <hi>Order,</hi> and that of <hi>Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
In the firſt ſenſe, they grant all Biſhops are alike, but not
in the laſt. We proved before, and ſhal prove hereafter,
that diſtinction is frivolous, for the preſent it will be ſufficient
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64826:97"/>
to refute that diſtinction of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> by the
teſtimony of an Author in great eſteem, in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and believed by them to be the Diſciple of the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul: viz. Dionyſius, Arcopagita,</hi> whom we now mentioned,

by the Prieſts: If the Prieſt go aſtray he is to be ordered
by the Biſhop: If the Biſhop debord, he ſhould be judged by thoſe
who ſucceeded to the Apoſtles: but if thoſe debord, they ought
be judged by thoſe of the ſame Order.</hi> Obſerve, he puts many
in the ſame order of alike Juriſdiction. In the firſt place of the

               <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> urge this place, againſt the ſupremacy of

5. 3. diſputed and vindicated before <hi>cap. 11. viz. ruling</hi> or
<hi>domination</hi> is forbidden in the Church, in this place, <hi>Luke</hi>
22. 25. which cannot conſiſt with an <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop,</hi>
which our Adverſaries grant to have the right of <hi>domination</hi>
in the Church.</p>
               <p>Bellarmin <hi>and</hi> Sanderus <hi>anſwer in this place,</hi> Tyrannical do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
is only forbidden, and not all domination; <hi>their
reaſon is, becauſe,</hi> domination and ruling like that of the Kings
of the Gentiles, is only forbidden, and not all domination.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, That this anſwer is grounded upon two falſe
ſuppoſitions: The firſt is, <hi>That all domination of the Kings of
the Gentiles is tyrannical.</hi> The ſecond is, that theſe words,
verſe 26. <hi>But ye ſhal not be ſo,</hi> have relation to the <hi>way of
domination,</hi> and not to <hi>domination it ſelf.</hi> The firſt ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is falſe: As is proved thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is notoriouſly falſe, <hi>That all domination of the
Kings of the Gentiles is tyrannical;</hi> not only, becauſe it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in ſeveral places of Scripture, <hi>That Kings rule by GOD,
and all powers are of GOD.</hi> But alſo, becauſe the Scripture
commands obedience to be given unto them, for that reaſon:
and alſo, <hi>Injoyns all to pray to them:</hi> but it is abſurd, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
<hi>That tyrannical government is by GODS ordination,</hi> or
that, <hi>The Word of GOD commands obedience unto it, or injoyns
all to pray for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:64826:98"/>
They anſwer, It is true indeed, that all the ruling of the
Kings of the Gentiles is not tyrannical. To affirm ſo, it
fights againſt hiſtory, and experience; but in this place, our
Savior forbids his Apoſtles, <hi>To imitate the Kings of the
Gentiles, when they exerciſe Dominion unlawfully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is replyed, This is their ſecond falſe ſuppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
that theſe words, verſe 26. <hi>But ye ſhal not be ſo,</hi> are relative to
the way of <hi>domination,</hi> and not to <hi>domination it ſelf.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
theſe words, are referred <hi>not to the way of domination,
or tyrannical domination:</hi> but <hi>dominattion ſimply is forbidden
in the Church,</hi> which is proved by theſe following reaſons.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, That domination is forbidden, for which the
Diſciples did contend, or, <hi>Who ſhould be greateſt in it?</hi>
But it is againſt all ſenſe to affirm, <hi>That they contended who
ſhould be the greateſt Tyrants?</hi> By which it is evident, that not
only <hi>tyrannical domination,</hi> but all ſort of <hi>domination</hi> is
forbidden.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That is forbidden, which is oppoſit unto <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi>
but all <hi>domination</hi> is oppoſit to <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by <hi>Matthew</hi> 20. 28. and 26. In which place the ſame
contention, or ſuch an other contention, among the Diſciples
is related; and for the ſame reaſons, <hi>domination is forbidden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25. Theſe who rule among the <hi>Gentils,</hi>
by reaſon of their <hi>domination,</hi> are called <hi>bountiful.</hi> Whereby
it is evident that our Savior, <hi>forbids domination ſimply:</hi> for
none are called <hi>bountiful,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>tyrannical domination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Theſe words, <hi>Ye ſhal not be ſo,</hi> or, <hi>ye ſhal not do
ſo,</hi> or, <hi>not ſo ye,</hi> according to the conſtant phraſe of Scripture,
<hi>denotat an inhibition of a thing altogether, and not of it in ſuch
and ſuch a way.</hi> So <hi>Gen. 4. Cain</hi> affirms, <hi>And he who meets
me, ſhal kill me:</hi> the LORD anſwers, <hi>Non ſic, not ſo:</hi> the
meaning is, <hi>he ſhal not be killed at all:</hi> And not that he ſhal not
be killed <hi>after ſuch and ſuch a manner.</hi> So <hi>Nehem. 5. 15. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:64826:99"/>
complains, <hi>That ſome of the former Governors had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
the people, and taken bread, and wine, and money from
them; and made their ſervants rule over them.</hi> He adds,
<hi>I did not ſo,</hi> his meaning is, <hi>That he did not only not take bread,
and wine, and money from them, or oppreſſea them in ſuch a
manner: but that he did not oppreſs them at all.</hi> Likewiſe,
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 1 3. it is ſaid, <hi>That the righteous man ſhal be like a tree
bringing forth fruit ſeaſonably, &amp;c.</hi> Verſe 4. it is affirmed,
<hi>The wicked are not ſo,</hi> the meaning is, not only, <hi>that the wicked
ſhal not proſper in that manner only: but that they ſhal not
proſper at all.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>Matthew</hi> 19. when the Phariſees ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to Chriſt, that <hi>Moſes did command to give a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
that a man ſhould put away his wife upon every ſlight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</hi>
Our Savior anſwers, verſe 8. <hi>From the beginning it
was not ſo.</hi> In which words, the meaning of our Savior is,
<hi>That divorces without juſt reaſon, ſhould not be given at
all, and not that divorces without reaſon may be given, in
ſome caſes, although not in other.</hi> And thus we have proved,
that in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25. not only <hi>tyrannical domination,</hi> but all
<hi>domination</hi> is forbidden in the Church. And conſequently,
the <hi>ſupremacy of Peter is alſo there forbidden: ſince a viſible
head of the Church cannot be without domination.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
our Adverſaries affirm, that only <hi>tyrannical domination</hi> is
forbidden: Although it were ſo, this place quite militats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
an <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop;</hi> becauſe we did demonſtrate
<hi>cap</hi> 11. by ſix unanſwerable particulars or arguments, that
the <hi>domination of the Biſhop of Rome: was not only tyrannical,
but alſo blaſphemous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have hitherto diſputed againſt the <hi>ſupremacy of Peter,</hi>
from this place, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25. Now let us examine, how from
the ſame place, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Sanderus</hi> diſput for it? Their
Sophiſtry is admirable, and therefore it will not be unpleaſing
to examine it. Their firſt ſophiſtry conſiſts in this, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64826:99"/>
preſſed with paralell places to this, that nothing can be
gathered from thoſe contentions of the Apoſtles, <hi>for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of Peter, but rather much againſt it. Sanderus</hi> as a
ground of his future ſophiſtry, makes a diſtinction between
this place, and theſe other <hi>paralell places,</hi> which is this. The
Apoſtles, ſaith he, Contended four ſeveral times for <hi>dominion.</hi>
The firſt is, after the transfiguration of Chriſt in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 34. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 46. The ſecond, after the
petition of the ſons of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> or of their Mother, <hi>Matthew</hi>
20. verſe 20. and <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 35. The third time was, when
the Tribute was payed, <hi>Matthew.</hi> 18. 1. The laſt time was,
after the Supper, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. The firſt three times, <hi>Sanderus</hi> grants
that nothing can be gathered, for the <hi>ſupremacy of Peter:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in theſe places, only <hi>prophane domination is forbidden.</hi>
But in the laſt place, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. not only <hi>prophane domination</hi> is
forbidden: but alſo, <hi>Lawful domination, or the ſupremacy of
Peter is generally and confuſedly, if not ordained, at leaſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
or intimated.</hi> If ye ask at <hi>Sanderus,</hi> What more in this
laſt place, then in the three firſt, ſince in all the four places, the
thing for which the Apoſtles ſtrove, was the ſame: and the
anſwer of Chriſt unto them was the ſame? He anſwers you,
ſeveral ways, but before we examine his anſwers, we will firſt
ſhow how he is miſtaken, in affirming the Diſciples <hi>ſtrove four
times for dominion.</hi> Albeit it be no great matter how many
times they ſtrove? Yet, it is certain, that they did not ſtrive
four times, but only two, or at the moſt three times. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Evangeliſts doth not mention it oftner then two times,
as <hi>Matth. cap.</hi> 18. &amp; 20. <hi>Mark. cap. 9. 10. Luk. cap.</hi> 9. 22. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it is certain that <hi>Matthew 18. Mark.</hi> 9. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.
mentions the ſame <hi>contention</hi> or <hi>hiſtory,</hi> as appears, not only
by the place <hi>Capernaum</hi> mentioned, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. and the paying
of the <hi>Tribute,</hi> was made in the ſame place, <hi>Matthew 17.
After which the contention aroſe, Matthew</hi> 18. But alſo, by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64826:100"/>
the circumſtance of the <hi>little Child,</hi> mentioned <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 47. and
<hi>Mark 9. 36. Hieronymus</hi> alſo, and <hi>Euthymius,</hi> affirm, That
the ſame ſtory is related, <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. and <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.
The ſecond contention is mentioned, <hi>Matthew 20. Mark</hi> 10. &amp;
<hi>Luk.</hi> 22. It is very probable, that the ſame hiſtory is related
alſo in thoſe three places; becauſe the anſwer of Chriſt is
the ſame in them all: but <hi>Euthymius</hi> makes <hi>Luke</hi> 22. a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
contention from <hi>Matthew</hi> 20. and <hi>Mark</hi> 10. becauſe in
<hi>Luk.</hi> 22. no mention is made of <hi>the petition of the Sons of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedeus,
or their Mother,</hi> as <hi>Mark</hi> 10. and <hi>Matthew</hi> 20. So at
the moſt, the Apoſtles ſtrove only three times for <hi>dominion,</hi>
if not two times only. But let it be granted to <hi>Sanderus,</hi> that they
<hi>ſtrove four times:</hi> We ask him, what more can be gathered for
the <hi>ſupremacy of Peter,</hi> from <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. then from the other three
places? ſiince is all four they ſtrove for the ſame thing, <hi>viz.
dominion.</hi> And our Savior diſſwades them from ſuch ſtriving,
for the ſame reaſons, in the firſt three places, (or at leaſt in
ſome of them) for which he diſwades them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanderus</hi> anſwers, and alſo <hi>Bellarmin:</hi> Firſt, that <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.
Our Savior affirms, <hi>Let the greateſt among you be as the leaſt;</hi>
but <hi>Matthew</hi> 20. 26. he only affirmeth, <hi>Whoſoever will be
great among you, let him be your ſervant.</hi> The difference is,
<hi>Greateſt, Luk.</hi> 22. imports a ſuperiority, which <hi>Great, Matthew</hi>
20. doth not import.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, They bable, for it appears expreſly by the
words, that the meaning of our Savior in both places is the
ſame. As for the objection, it is of no moment, <hi>for great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, and greateſt among you,</hi> is the ſame thing: <hi>Great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you</hi> is an <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> for the ſuperlative of the <hi>Latins</hi> and
<hi>Grecians,</hi> which ſuperlative, the <hi>Oriental tongues have not;</hi>
and ſo <hi>great</hi> and <hi>greateſt</hi> are the ſame thing, <hi>Matthew</hi> and
<hi>Mark</hi> retain the <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> but <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſeth it in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative

that is, what <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> calls <hi>great</hi> in the <hi>poſitive
degree, Luke</hi> calls <hi>more great,</hi> in the <hi>comparative degree:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

                  </gap>, <hi>greateſt
among you, in the ſuperlative degree.</hi> For its certain, at leaſt,
that the meaning of <hi>great</hi> in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> and of <hi>greateſt</hi>
in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. is the ſame: becauſe the <hi>Syrian</hi> Interpreter, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them both by one word. Likewiſe, that <hi>great</hi> in <hi>Matthew</hi>
and <hi>Mark,</hi> is the ſame with <hi>greateſt</hi> in <hi>Luke,</hi> appears, becauſe
<hi>great</hi> in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> is <hi>comparative,</hi> for immediately,
after theſe words follow, <hi>He who ſhould be firſt among you.</hi>
Whereby it is evident, that <hi>great</hi> is all one with <hi>greateſt.</hi> Since

that one already is <hi>greateſt</hi> among them. Where he obſerves

the difference between a <hi>metaphor,</hi> and <hi>a ſimilitude</hi> is, that a
<hi>metaphor</hi> contracts the <hi>ſimilitude to one word, v. g.</hi> when we call
a ſubtile witty man <hi>like a Fox:</hi> it is a <hi>ſimilitude</hi> formally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed:
but when we call him <hi>a Fox,</hi> it is a <hi>metaphor:</hi> and ſo
it may be concluded, that both thoſe ſpeeches may be called
as well <hi>ſimilituds,</hi> as <hi>metaphors.</hi> That is, a <hi>ſimilitude</hi> is a <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor</hi>
inlarged by the particles <hi>as,</hi> or <hi>like.</hi> And a <hi>metaphor</hi> is a
<hi>ſimilitude</hi> contracted, taking away thoſe particles <hi>as:</hi> when we
ſay in the <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> a ſubtile man is like a <hi>Fox:</hi> we ſay in the
<hi>metaphor, He is a Fox.</hi> The meaning is the ſame in both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions:

inlarged, and the meaning in both is one, <hi>viz. The only way to
be great in the Kingdom of Heaven, is to carry themſelves humbly

                  <hi>Sanderus</hi> urgeth ſtill, that <hi>Luke</hi> 22. one muſt be greateſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
amongſt them, ſince our Savior inſtructs him, how to
carry himſelf in that ſtation, <hi>viz. as a ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, This objection is of like ſtuff with the
former, for if it were of any force, it would conclude that one
alſo were <hi>leaſt</hi> among them already: that is below all the reſt;
which <hi>Sanderus</hi> will not readily grant: becauſe, <hi>Luke, It is
ſaid, He that is leaſt among you, ſhal be great, cap.</hi> 9. 48. The
truth is, the ſpeech of our Savior in both theſe places is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit,
not mentioning any one in particular, either as <hi>greateſt</hi>
or <hi>leaſt.</hi> The true meaning of his words are, He who <hi>is moſt
ſubmiſsive</hi> among you, be who he will, one or other? deſerves
the greateſt reſpect, and for that reaſon will be greateſt in the
ſight of God, or in the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and <hi>Sanderus</hi> both ſet on with
an admirable Sophiſm, they differ in words, yet object the
ſame in ſubſtance. <hi>Sanderus</hi> propones it thus.</p>
               <p>Immediatly after our Savior had uttred theſe words, <hi>Let
him who is greateſt, be as a Servant.</hi> He propoſeth an example
of himſelf to be followed: by that perſon who is greateſt, in
theſe words, <hi>For I my ſelf am as a ſervant in the mids of you;</hi>
that is, ſaith <hi>Sanderus,</hi> Since <hi>I who am greateſt of you all, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
head of the Church, carrieth my ſelf like a Servant, he who
is head of the Church under me, and greateſt among you, ſhould
follow my example:</hi> other-wiſe, ſaith he, The words of
our Savior would not cohere with the words going before:
which they do by reaſon of the illative particle. <hi>For,</hi> verſe 27.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, We have proved already, that the ſpeech
of our Savior was directed to them all: and therefore it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres
well enough when he propoſeth his own example as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his former exhortation to them. His meaning is, I who
am greateſt among you, am as a Servant in the mids of you;
And therefore, any who would be really above the reſt in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64826:102"/>
eſteem of God, let him follow my example, by carrying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
humbly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> propoſeth this Argument in another manner, and
in effect ſurpaſſeth <hi>Sanderus</hi> both in Sophiſtry and Impudence.
He reaſons thus, <hi>lib. 1. cap. 9. De Pont. Rom.</hi> Chriſt ſaith he,
affirms, That he was a Servant in the mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.
But <hi>John</hi> 13. he affirms, The Diſciples ſpake truth, when they
called him <hi>Lord and Maſter.</hi> The ſcope of our Savior in theſe
words then, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. is to ordain one greateſt amongſt them,
or to exhort him, who is ordained already greateſt to follow
his example, both in greatneſs and humility: as if he had ſaid,
My will is, that one of you ſhould be head over the reſt as my
Vicar, and that he ſhal carry himſelf humbly, as I do, <hi>viz.</hi> as
a Servant to the reſt.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, That <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſophiſticats two wayes.
Firſt, he ſuppons falſly, that this exhortation of our Savior,
and the reaſon of it from his own example was directed to one
in particular: whereas it is directed to all the Apoſtles, and
therefore, his firſt ſophiſtry is in the perſons exhorted.</p>
               <p>His ſecond ſophiſtry is in the thing exhorted, <hi>viz.</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his own example. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> mentions two things in which
they are injoyned to follow the example of Chriſt. Firſt,
his greatneſs. Secondly, his humble carriage in the opinion of
<hi>Bellarmin.</hi> Our Savior exhorts them to follow his example in
both, to prove which he brings in that paſſage of <hi>John</hi> 13. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently,
having nothing to do with this paſſage, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.
By which it appears, that our Savior exhorts them only to
humility, or to follow the example of his humility, and not
of his greatneſs, as is evident by the words uttered by him, as
his reaſon, <hi>For, I am as a ſervant in the mids of you.</hi> The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſm
of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> redacted to a form is this, I am head of you
all, and carrieth my ſelf humbly, follow my example: <hi>Ergo</hi>
ſaith <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> He exhorts one to be head of the reſt, as
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64826:102"/>
himſelf was; and to carry himſelf humbly as himſelf did,
whereas our Savior deſires them all indefinitly (not one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular)
to follow his example in humble carriage: not in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi>
which he expreſly forbids, <hi>verſe</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>That this gloſs of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> is a new deviſed fiction amongſt
the reſt, to uphold the Supremacy of <hi>Peter</hi> againſt all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
we could further prove by many Fathers. On theſe words
we will mention one teſtimony; by which it appears, that
in the opinion of Antiquity, the words of our Savior were
ſpoken indefinitly to all, and not to one in particular. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that he exhorts them only to follow his example, in
humble carriage, and not in <hi>Domination.</hi> This paſſage is of
<hi>Theophylactus,</hi> upon thoſe words, <hi>Cum igitur ego, qui ab an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica
&amp; rationali natura ador<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pacto vos aequum eſt, magnificè de vobis ſentire, &amp; Primatum
ambire?</hi> By which words it appears, Firſt, that his ſpeech is
directed to them all. Secondly, that he exhorts them only to
follow his example in humility: we could alſo inſtance other
teſtimonies, but it is needleſs.</p>
               <p>Hitherto, in this Book we have diſputed the Supremacy of
<hi>Peter, pro</hi> and <hi>contra, viz.</hi> we have examined all what is alledged
of any moment, either for the inſtitution, or againſt the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Peter</hi> in that function of <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop.</hi> Both the
one ſide, and the other bring ſeveral Arguments, which we
have omitted; but they are of no moment in compariſon of
thoſe we have examined, being in effect nothing elſe but Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolaries
of the former, or elſe ſome places of Scripture miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
ſophiſticated, &amp; wreſted by the late <hi>Jeſuits</hi> againſt

are they taken for the moſt part from the Inſtitution of <hi>Peter</hi>
(as the former) but from his carriage and Prerogatives (as they
call them.) And leſt any ſhould think, that we omitted them,

of which is, <hi>That the prerogatives of both are ſo great, that none

he affirms, <hi>Paulus non egebat voce Petri, nec eo opus habebat:

words, it is evident to any intelligent Reader, that in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>Paul</hi> was to be preferred to <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have ſpoken already of perſonal Prerogatives, that they
can be no argument to prove the <hi>Supremacy of Peter,</hi> ſince in
the opinion of the Ancients, the Prerogatives of <hi>Paul</hi> were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to thoſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> as expreſly is affirmed by them: and
alſo Superior to thoſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> as may be gathered, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely
from their words: albeit out of modeſty they affirm it
not expreſly. Prerogatives then concluding <hi>Peter</hi> to be <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenick
Biſhop,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be <hi>prerogatives inſeparable
from that function.</hi> And in that caſe, the pretended ſucceſſors
of <hi>Peter,</hi> or the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt alſo have thoſe Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives:

among theſe Prerogatives are numbred <hi>walking upon the water,</hi>
and ſuch like, which would puzle the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> now to do.
In a word, among all thoſe prerogatives of <hi>Peter,</hi> there is not one
that concludes him more <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> then they do him
<hi>Emperor</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which none but a Sophiſter will deny. There
is not one of them which is not either notoriouſly falſe, or notoriouſly

reckon up what they have ſaid already, as, <hi>Tu es Petrus, ſibi
dabo claves, paſce oves meas:</hi> but alſo thoſe very things which
they diſput, after they have diſputed his Prerogatives, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Readers patience with repetitions of the ſame things.
Any who will take the pains to anatomize thoſe Volumns of
Controverſies ſet forth by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> they will find them to

of the ſame things <hi>ad nauſeam uſque; wreſted, mutilated,

thinking to deterr his learned Adverſaries from diſcovering his
weakneſs by his prolixity. In which Artifices, <hi>Baronius</hi> is
nothing inferior to him, being the moſt ſhameleſs corrupter
of Antiquity, which the world hath hitherto produced: as

that any indifferent man may be convinced of the truth. And

<hi>primacy of Juriſdiction,</hi> but only of <hi>order,</hi> which may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe of <hi>equal authority.</hi> As in a Colledge of Judges,

               <p>
                  <hi>The third</hi> prerogative <hi>is from</hi> Matthew 14. 29. That Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
only walked upon the waters with our Savior: <hi>As alſo,
that</hi> John 21. 7. That Peter did leap in the Sea for haſte to be
at Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, This is a great <hi>prerogative</hi> in <hi>Peter,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
ſhewing only the fervor of his minde, and love to Chriſt;
But inconſequent, to prove him <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop.</hi> Chriſts
<hi>appearing to Paul after his Aſcenſion,</hi> was a <hi>prerogative</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
inferior: <hi>Peter</hi> is no more concluded <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop,</hi>
by this <hi>prerogative,</hi> then the other Apoſtles by the miracles
wrought by them.</p>

                  <hi>The fourth</hi> prerogative <hi>is from</hi> Matthew 16. 16. viz. That
the Myſtery of the Trinity, and Incarnation of Chriſt, was firſt
revealed to <hi>Peter,</hi> before it was revealed to any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, Although it were granted, as in effect
many Fathers believe that it is true; it is inconſequent to
prove <hi>Peter Oecumenick Biſhop.</hi> Secondly, it is notoriouſly
falſe, and preſuppons that the <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets, and Saints
of the Old Teſtament, were ignorant of the Mystery of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Incarnation of Chriſt.</hi> If they inſtance, they knew
only in general, <hi>That the Meſſias would be the ſecond Perſon
of the Trinity, Incarnas, and born of a Virgin; but not in
particular, that Chriſt was the Meſſias.</hi> It is replyed that <hi>John</hi>
the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> before ever <hi>Peter</hi> knew Chriſt, profeſſed that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> in particular, <hi>the ſuppoſed Son of Joſeph and
Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> was the <hi>Son of GOD, and the Savior of the
World, foretold by the Prophets. Nathanael</hi> alſo profeſſed
ſo much. It is a moſt ſimple evaſion of <hi>Bellarmins, That theſe
confeſſed Chriſt to be the Son of GOD, in that manner, as all
the Saints are called Sons of GOD, or by Adoption:</hi> ſince <hi>John</hi>
the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> expreſly teſtifies that <hi>Chriſt was the Meſſias foretold
by the Prophets.</hi> Alſo, that the ſame was revealed to <hi>Simeon,
Luke</hi> 2. none without impudence can deny <hi>Nathanael</hi> alſo,
<hi>John</hi> 1. not only calls Chriſt the <hi>Son of GOD, but alſo the
King of Iſrael:</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin, tract.</hi> 7. in <hi>John,</hi> affirms,
that the confeſſion of <hi>Nathanael,</hi> and that of <hi>Peter</hi> were the
ſame.</p>
               <p>The fifth <hi>prerogative,</hi> is <hi>Matthew 16. 18. The gates of hell ſhal
not overcome it.</hi> It is anſwered, we ſhewed before the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of this place, <hi>viz. That the gates of hell ſhould not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Church.</hi> They alledge here a great <hi>prerogative,</hi> for,
ſay they, the reſt of the Apoſtles had not this promiſe, <hi>for the
gates of hell prevailed againſt the Churches founded by the other
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>peſtles;</hi> ſince the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> founded by <hi>James,</hi>

and alſo the Churches founded by the other Apoſtles are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed.
But it is anſwered, This <hi>prerogative</hi> is grounded upon
a falſe ſuppoſition; <hi>viz.</hi> that our Savior meaned by the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Church founded by <hi>Peter,</hi> of which he did
not dream: for we ſhewed before, that the <hi>Rock</hi> upon which
the Church is built, was only Chriſt: and that theſe Fathers
who interpreted the <hi>Rock</hi> to be the <hi>confeſſion of Peter,</hi> or <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
himſelf,</hi> meaned all one thing with thoſe who interpreted
the <hi>Rock</hi> to be Chriſt; as is evident in <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> who in one
place interprets the <hi>Rock</hi> to be Chriſt. In an other the <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Peter.</hi> In a third, <hi>Peter himſelf.</hi> However, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
themſelves pitifully, in expounding the <hi>Rock</hi> both to
be <hi>Peter,</hi> and the <hi>ſeat of Peter:</hi> which are different things, and
it ſhal alſo be proved in the laſt chapter of this book, that <hi>Rome
was not the ſeat of Peter,</hi> more then of <hi>Paul.</hi> And therefore
they abſurdly interpret, <hi>the Rock to be the Church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixth <hi>prerogative, Matthew 17. Chriſt commanded tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to be payed for him and</hi> Peter: whence ſome Fathers ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the Apoſtles themſelves knew the ſupremacy of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
So <hi>Hieronymus</hi> on <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. as he is cited by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, Although ſome Fathers were of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that the Apoſtles knew by <hi>that tribute paying,</hi> that
<hi>Peter</hi> would be preferred to them all: the opinion of thoſe
Fathers is notoriouſly falſe; <hi>for the ſtrife of the ſons of</hi> Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
<hi>was after the tribute paying.</hi> But they never would have
demanded to be preferred to the reſt, if they had known that
<hi>Peter</hi> was preferred already: Yea, alſo that contention of all
the Apoſtles for the primacy, <hi>was after that tribute paying.</hi>
But they had been mad-men to have contended for the thing
<hi>Peter</hi> had already. As for <hi>Hieronymus, Bellarmin</hi> cites him
unfaithfully, he on <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. expreſly affirms, <hi>That theſe
were in an error who collected the ſupremacy of Peter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:64826:106"/>
that tribute paying: Bellarmin</hi> hath an other ſhift, that the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
mentioned by <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> conſiſted in this, <hi>That they
believed by that tribute paying, that</hi> Peter <hi>would be a temporal
Prince or Monarch.</hi> But it is replyed, though that fiction were
granted, they are alſo in an error, who believe that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome is a temporal monarch.</hi> But they affirm, that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was the ſame which the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is: but that he
holds himſelf as a temporal Monarch, and teacheth it <hi>in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi>
we ſhewed before, <hi>cap</hi> 11. However it is a very ſtrange
conſequence, <hi>Peter payed tribute;</hi> Ergo, <hi>he was Monarch of the
Church,</hi> ſince the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> (as ſhal be proved, <hi>part 3.
lib.</hi> 1.) refuſe to pay tribute, <hi>Becauſe they pretend they are
Monarchs of the Church.</hi> It is notorious alſo, that all the
Apoſtles, <hi>viritim,</hi> payed tribute as well as <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bellarmin <hi>and others inſtance with great</hi> pompe, <hi>that ſome
myſtery lurks in this, that our Savior</hi> commanded tribute to be
payed for him and <hi>Peter: viz.</hi> That the heads of the families
only payed tribute, and conſequently, that Chriſt was head of the
family, and <hi>Peter</hi> ſecondary head under him.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, That argument would conclude, that all
the <hi>Church Militant payed only tribute to their Oecumenick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop;
or that the ſaid tribute was payed for all the Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant:</hi>
which cannot be mentioned without laughter. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they go on in ſophiſtry, and proves by the teſtimony of
<hi>Hieronymus, that only the heads of families payed tribute:
Quid tum poſtea?</hi> It doth not follow, <hi>That the head of the</hi>
Church Militant <hi>payed tribute for all the Members of it.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it is impudent ſophiſtry, to pretend the authority of
<hi>Hieronymus.</hi> His words are, <hi>Poſt Auguſtum Caeſarem, Judaea
facta eſt tributaria, &amp; omnes cenſi capite ferebantur.</hi> It is ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
ſophiſtry (ſince no learned man can be ſo ignorant)
to affirme, that <hi>Hieronymus</hi> in theſe words, mentions, <hi>That
heads of the families only payed tribute:</hi> ſince it appears to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64826:107"/>
all, who are not utterly ignorant of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, that
<hi>cenſus capite,</hi> imports as much as <hi>Viritim,</hi> that is, <hi>Every
perſon payed tribute, or every head for himſelf, and not only heads
of families.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is demanded then, What was the meaning of our Savior,
in that paying of tribute for <hi>Peter</hi> and himſelf? <hi>Chryſoſtomus,
hom.</hi> 59. on <hi>Matthew,</hi> thinks this was the reaſon, <hi>Becauſe both
our Savior and</hi> Peter <hi>were firſt born.</hi> But the holy Father is
in a great miſtake, for two reaſons. The firſt is, <hi>Becauſe that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
was not the tribute of the firſt born, (which was payed only once
in a life time) but an annual tribute, which was payed every
year.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Peter</hi> was not firſt born, but <hi>Andrew</hi> his
brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Janſenius,</hi> a Learned and Ingenuous Papiſt, <hi>Concord.</hi> 69.
affirms, the reaſon was, <hi>Becauſe</hi> Peter <hi>and Chriſt was then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
alone.</hi> He is not ſo ſubtile as <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> to gather any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of <hi>Peter,</hi> from thoſe words: The truth is, both <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and our Savior dwelt at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> as may be gathered
from <hi>Matthew 9. 1. Mark 2. 1. Luke</hi> 4. 31. 38. And it is very
like that our Savior was then in the houſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> to which
he went out of the <hi>Synagogue, Luke</hi> 4. 38. and being <hi>Peters</hi>
Gueſt, and Maſter alſo, payed for him; ye may ſee by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this <hi>prerogative,</hi> how they ſcrape Sophiſtry out of the
fire, to prove the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeventh <hi>prerogative,</hi> is, <hi>two miracles in fiſhing, Luke</hi>
5. 3. and <hi>John</hi> 21. 6. If ye demand, what can be gathered
from theſe miracles? They tell you, Chriſt taught in <hi>Peters</hi>
ſhip, and <hi>Peters</hi> ſhip was the Church; and ſince <hi>Peter</hi> was
head of his own ſhip, he was alſo <hi>head of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, How know they that the ſhip was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
Salmero</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> doubts he was ſo rich. And ſo
that argument falls a will, except they prove that the ſhip
was <hi>Peters.</hi> It is admirable to conſider how <hi>Bellarmin</hi> plungeth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64826:107"/>
himſelf in Sophiſtry; diſtilling the <hi>ſupremacy of Peter</hi> from
the lymbick of his brains by wilde allegories; that the Reade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
may laugh. It will not be amiſs to anatomize his Diſpute.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He affirms, theſe two <hi>miracles of Fiſhing,</hi> both ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
the <hi>Church:</hi> that of <hi>Luke 5. the Church Militant,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was before the Reſurrection: that of <hi>John 21. the
Church Triumphant,</hi> becauſe <hi>it was after the Reſurrection.</hi>
He adds an other reaſon, in the firſt <hi>Fiſhing,</hi> our Savior bid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>them only make ready their nets for the fiſhing.</hi> In the ſecond,
he injoyns them, <hi>to caſt out the net upon their right hand.</hi>
Who doubts but the Church Militant is ſignified by the firſt
<hi>Fiſhing?</hi> Becauſe in it both good and bad are received; what
ever ſide of the ſhip the net be caſt from. And who can call
it in queſtion, that the <hi>ſecond fiſhing ſignifies the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant?</hi>
In which only the good are comprehended,
ſince the Apoſtles are injoyned, <hi>To caſt out the net on the
right ſide of the ſhip:</hi> ſtill good, but better followeth. In the
firſt <hi>fiſhing,</hi> the nets do break, <hi>denotating the Schiſms and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of the Church Militant.</hi> In the ſecond, the nets did not brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
at all, which ſignifyeth, <hi>The Vnity of the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</hi>
Learned ſubtility follows, <hi>In the firſt fiſhing, the number
of the fiſh is not determinated which were catched,</hi> ſignifying,
or fulfilling that paſſage of the <hi>Pſalm, I ſpake and they were
multiplyed without number;</hi> which is a clear demonſtration,
<hi>That the Church Militant is repreſented by that fiſhing.</hi> But
in the ſecond <hi>fiſhing,</hi> the caught <hi>fiſh</hi> were preciſely 153. By
which it is no leſs evident, that in it, <hi>The Church Triumphant
is repreſented.</hi> Laſtly, If any obſtinat Heretick be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by theſe former reaſons, that in theſe two <hi>fiſhings,</hi> the
<hi>Church Militant</hi> and <hi>Triumphant</hi> are repreſented, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be convinced, by this following reaſon. <hi>viz.</hi> In the
<hi>firſt fiſhing, the fiſh were taken in the ſhip, Luke</hi> 5. But in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<hi>John 21. The fiſh were not taken in the ſhip, but drawn a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64826:108"/>
ſhore in the net.</hi> The firſt ſignifying, <hi>The fluctuating of the
Church Militant, receiving indifferently all.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>The
ſtability of the Church Triumphant, receiving none but the
Elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon thoſe irrefragable principles, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> demonſtrats
the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter</hi> thus. Since, ſaith he, Both theſe <hi>fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
repreſent the Church, and <hi>Peter</hi> is the chief <hi>Fiſher</hi> of them
both: Who but an Heretick will deny, that <hi>Peter is head of
the Church?</hi> And as if there were no more to prove, but that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was the <hi>Maſter-Fiſher;</hi> he falls to the proving of it. Firſt,
<hi>Our Savior ſeeing more ſhips on the ſhore, entred that of</hi> Peters,
<hi>and not the reſt.</hi> Secondly, <hi>He bade</hi> Peter <hi>lanch out, and make
ready the nets.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>He ſaid to</hi> Peter, <hi>Fear not, after this
thou ſhalt be a Fiſher of men;</hi> and thus way he proves <hi>Peter</hi>
to be <hi>Maſter Fiſher</hi> in the firſt <hi>Fiſhing.</hi> That he was alſo in
the ſecond he proves: Firſt, becauſe <hi>Peter affirmed, he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a fiſhing, and the reſt ſaid, they would go with him.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>Peter drew the net to the land.</hi> It is needleſs to ſpend
time in refuting <hi>has quiſquilias:</hi> any who would ſee <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
and his fellows are exſibilated by <hi>Chamier,</hi> let him read <hi>tom.

               <p>The eight <hi>prerogative</hi> is taken from <hi>Luke 22. 32. But I have
prayed for thee that thy faith fail not: therefore when thou
art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> If ye aske them, What
<hi>prerogative</hi> is here? They tell you firſt, that theſe words
were ſpoken to <hi>Peter</hi> immediatly after our Savior had confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the ſupremacy upon him: In the former contention, verſe
26. <hi>confuſedly</hi> and <hi>generally,</hi> not naming him. But now, in
theſe words, he deſigns in particular, <hi>Peter to be that perſon
whom he called greateſt amongſt them,</hi> verſe 26.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, It was proved falſe, <hi>cap.</hi> 14. that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was ordained greateſt among them, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 26.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They build on this, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> is injoyned
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64826:108"/>
by Chriſt to confirm his brethren therein. But it is anſwered,
<hi>Confirming of brethren</hi> inferrs not an <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, confirmed brethren, Acts</hi> 14. 22. So
<hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas, Acts</hi> 15. 32. Innumerable other particulars
(but it is needleſs to mention them) might be produced. And
whereas they urge, that the word <hi>confirm</hi> imports <hi>authority.</hi>
It is anſwered, Sometime it doth, but not <hi>ſupream authority;</hi>
however in this place it imports no authority at all, but only
<hi>good example:</hi> So <hi>Theophylactus, Twenim,</hi> Petre, <hi>converſus
bonum exemplum ſies poenitentiae omnibus: nullúsque eorum qui
in me credunt, deſperabit, in te reſpiciens.</hi> Where obſerve, he
makes that confirming, nothing but by good example, <hi>he ſhal
confirm his brethren;</hi> for in theſe words, our Savior is meaning
the <hi>Apoſtacy of</hi> Peter <hi>in his thrice denying him:</hi> and ſo <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylactus</hi>
comments upon the place, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Peter ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
his Brethren, by keeping them from deſpair of forgiveneſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their ſins were never ſo great; ſince Chriſt pardoned him,
after ſo great a ſin as denying him thrice:</hi> This expoſition of
<hi>Theophylactus</hi> is the ſame with that of <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> and <hi>Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>
and <hi>Maldonat</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who upon this place hath theſe
words, <hi>Ambroſij, Theophylacti, &amp; Euthymij interpretatio mihi

                        <desc>•</desc>

In which words the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> expreſly aquieſceth in the
expoſition of theſe Fathers Whence appears the notable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry
of <hi>Bellarmin, lib. 4. cap. 3. de pont. Rom.</hi> who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
theſe words of our Savior, <hi>Therefore when thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
confirm thy brethren</hi> thus. The ſenſe, ſaith he, of theſe
words, is not that <hi>Peter repenting him of his ſin, or converted,
ſhould confirm the Apoſtles by his example:</hi> but this, <hi>Thou whoſe
faith cannot be deficient, when thou fees others vacillating, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
thy ſelf to them, and confirm them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They object many things here, as that <hi>Theophylactus</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64826:109"/>
That <hi>Peter</hi> after his repentance ſhal recover <hi>Primatum
omnium,</hi> and <hi>Praefecturam orbis:</hi> that <hi>Ambroſius</hi> affirms, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus
Eccleſiae praeponitur poſtquaem tentatus à Diabolo eſt. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus</hi>
alſo calls <hi>Peter Rectorem Eccleſiae, cui claves Regni Coelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
creditae ſunt.</hi> But theſe objections are of no moment. And
firſt, that <hi>Theophylactus</hi> affirms that <hi>Peter</hi> recovered the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
above all,</hi> it is nothing. For firſt, the meaning is no other,
then <hi>that he hath a chief place in the Church in dignity, not in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction:</hi>
and it ſhal be proved, <hi>cap. 19. &amp;</hi> 20. that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the other Apoſtles are called <hi>Principes Primates,</hi> but alſo
Praefecti <hi>orbis,</hi> and <hi>Rectores Eccleſiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ninth Prerogative of <hi>Peter</hi> is, that our Savior firſt of
all appeared to him after his reſurrection: But it is anſwered,
firſt, although it were true, it is of no moment to prove <hi>Peter</hi>
Oecumenick Biſhop. Secondly, it is notoriouſly falſe, becauſe
he appeared to <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> before ever he appeared to
<hi>Peter, Mark</hi> 16. 19. before ever he appeared to his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or to any of the Apoſtles. If <hi>Bellarmin</hi> anſwer, That <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Magdalen</hi> was only a woman: It is replyed, It concluds, <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had the Primacy over the Apoſtles,</hi> if the Argument were
of any force. Secondly, it is very probable, that our Savior
appeared to theſe two diſciples, going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> before he
appeared to any of the Apoſtles: for when they came back to
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and found the <hi>eleven</hi> gathered together, then they
affirmed, that the Lord was riſen indeed, &amp; had appeared to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi>
which is all that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> alledgeth to prove that Chriſt
firſt appeared to <hi>Peter,</hi> except that of 1 <hi>Corinth. 15. He appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto Cephas, and after that unto the eleven:</hi> however, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
it be very probable that our Savior appeared to <hi>Peter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever he appeared unto the other Apoſtles: yet it concludes
no more that <hi>Peter</hi> had Primacy over the the other Apoſtles, then
that thoſe two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus, had primacy over
them,</hi> ſince he appeared unto them, as well as unto <hi>Peter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever he appeared to the other Apoſtles.</p>

                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:64826:109"/>
The tenth Prerogative is taken from <hi>John</hi> 13. when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
<hi>waſhing the Apoſtles feet,</hi> did firſt waſh thoſe of <hi>Peter.</hi> It
is anſwered firſt, Although it were true, it is of no moment
to prove <hi>Peter Oecumenick biſhop.</hi> Secondly, it is only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
of ſome Fathers, that <hi>Peters feet were firſt waſhed:</hi> it
cannot begathered from the text at all. <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> is of that
opinion indeed, and ſo is <hi>Nonnus</hi> in his <hi>Poetical paraphraſe:</hi>
but other Fathers are againſt it, as <hi>Chryſoſtomus, Theophylactus.
Bellarmin</hi> urgeth here, that thoſe Fathers affirm, That <hi>Judas
only had his feet waſhed before Peter:</hi> but what then? <hi>Bellarmins</hi>
reaſon is very bad, concluding from that <hi>waſhing, Peter</hi> to be
Oecumenick Biſhop, ſince <hi>Judas</hi> was waſhed before him: he
inſtances <hi>Judas</hi> was a Traitor, and none of the other Apoſtles
would have ſuffered our Savior to waſh their feet before theſe
of <hi>Peters,</hi> but only <hi>Judas.</hi> But it is replyed, Firſt, if there had
been any my ſtery of Primacy <hi>in that waſhing of feet,</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
would never <hi>have waſhed the feet of Judas before thoſe of
Peter.</hi> Secondly, not only <hi>Origines</hi> and <hi>Ambroſius</hi> affirm,
<hi>That he waſhed the feet of other Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before thoſe of</hi> Peter,
(beſides <hi>Judas) but alſo Popiſh Doctors affirm the ſame,</hi> as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,
Lyranus,</hi> and <hi>Salmero</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eleventh Prerogative is from <hi>John</hi> 21. 18. where our
Savior ſaith to <hi>Peter, But when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt
ſtretch forth thine hands, and another ſhal gird thee.</hi> If ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what Prerogative is here? They anſwer that in thoſe
words, Chriſt ſhows to <hi>Peter what death he ſhould die,</hi> viz.
<hi>That he ſhould be crucified as himſelf was.</hi> But it is anſwered,
Firſt, although it were true, it doth not conclude <hi>Peter</hi> to be
<hi>Oecumenick Biſhop.</hi> Secondly, that our Savior foretold to
<hi>Peter a violent death</hi> in thoſe words is more then probable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but that he foretold <hi>the death of the croſs,</hi> can no wayes be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from the words. And whereas they inſiſt upon <hi>ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth of hands,</hi> it is of no moment; ſince thoſe words do
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64826:110"/>
not conclude <hi>ſtretching forth of hands upon the croſs neceſſarily,</hi>
ſince ones hands are ſtretched out when they are bound: which
ſort of <hi>ſtretching,</hi> our Savior queſtionleſs means by, as appears
by theſe words, <hi>When thou waſt young, thou girdedſt thy ſelf, but

Interlinear Gloſs, <hi>cinget vinoulis, ſhal gird thy loins. Lyranus</hi>
(convinced that ſtretching of hands was by <hi>Cords,</hi> and not by
<hi>Nails</hi>) affirms, That <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified, being bound by <hi>cords</hi>
upon the croſs: which is a very ridiculous fancy: however,
that by <hi>ſtretching of hands,</hi> is not meant <hi>crucifying,</hi> but only
<hi>binding,</hi> appears by the following words; <hi>and lead thee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou wouldeſt not.</hi> It is notorious, that they uſe not to
lead one who is crucified already any where.</p>
               <p>The twelfth Prerogative is from <hi>Acts 1. 15. And in thoſe
dayes Peter ſtood up in the midſt of the Diſciples.</hi> Here they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great things. Firſt, that <hi>Peter convocated the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;
Ergo</hi> he was Oecumenick Biſhop. But firſt, it is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent;</hi>
although he had gathered them in one, it doth not
follow, that he did ſo by <hi>authori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing they gather, that <hi>Peter</hi> having propoſed,
<hi>that one ſhould be choſen in the place of Judas, they all obeyed his
command.</hi> But it is anſwered, <hi>Peter</hi> only uttered his opinion,
(as any one of them might have done) that ſuch a thing was
neceſſary, and they followed his opinion. It is ridiculous to

                  </gap>om thence any <hi>authority of Peter over the reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Salmero <hi>the</hi> Jeſuit <hi>collects, that</hi> Peter repreſented Chriſt, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
Luke <hi>affirms,</hi> He ſtood up in the midſt of them. <hi>But it is
anſwered, It follows likewiſe,</hi> that the little child, Mat. 18.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64826:110"/>
                  <hi>and</hi> the man with the withered hand, Mark 3. <hi>and</hi> Paul, Ast. 27.
Were viſible heads of the Church. <hi>That</hi> ſtanding in the mids,
<hi>imports no authority of it ſelf, but rather a Miniſtrie, appears
by</hi> Luke 22. 27. <hi>where our Savior affirms,</hi> He was in the
mids of them as a ſervant.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth Prerogative, is, from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. where after the
Apoſtles had received the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Peter</hi> firſt of all, <hi>did
promulgat the Goſpel.</hi> But it is anſwered, Firſt, although it
were true, it is inconſequent to prove <hi>Peter viſible head of the
Church,</hi> as is notorious. Secondly, it is falſe, or at leaſt not
certain, that <hi>Peter preached the Goſpel firſt:</hi> for <hi>Luke</hi> affirms,
Before that time, the Apoſtles <hi>ſpake with tongues</hi> to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all the hearers, but queſtionleſs, what they ſpake
was the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The fourteenth Prerogative, is, from <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 6. Where <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cured the lame man.</hi> If ye ask, what Prerogative is here,
ſince <hi>Paul</hi> and other Apoſtles did equivalent miracles? They
anſwer, <hi>It was the firſt miracle the Apoſtles did after Chriſts A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is replyed, What although it were? It doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>Peter</hi> to be <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop.</hi> Secondly, if it be not
falſe, it is uncertain, for we read in the ſecond chapter, that
the Apoſtles did many miracles, which probably was before
that time.</p>
               <p>The fifteenth Prerogative, is, from <hi>Asts</hi> 5. Where <hi>Peter
killed with a word Annanias and Sapphira.</hi> But it is anſwered,
<hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 13. ſtruck <hi>Elimas the ſorcerer with blindneſs with a
word only, or in as miraculous a manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixteenth Prerogative, is, from <hi>Acts 9. 32. And it came
to paſs, as Peter walked throughout all quarters, he came alſo to
the Saints that dwelt at Lydda.</hi> If ye ask what they mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
They will tell you, <hi>that Peter did the office of a General in an
Army.</hi> But it is falſe, that <hi>Peter walked through the Saints,</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:64826:111"/>
viſiting them otherwiſe, then Paul did, Acts. 18.</p>
               <p>The ſeventeenth Prerogative is from <hi>Acts</hi> 10 where <hi>Peter prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
firſt to the Gentiles, being commanded ſo to do in that viſion.</hi>
But it is anſwered, Although <hi>Peter</hi> had firſt preached unto the
<hi>Gentiles:</hi> it doth not conclude him <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
if not falſe, it is at leaſt not certain, becauſe <hi>Philip</hi> his
<hi>preaching at Samaria,</hi> and his <hi>baptiſing of the Eunuch</hi> are both
mentioned by <hi>Luke,</hi> before that viſion of <hi>Peter</hi> concerning <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eighteenth Prerogative, is, from <hi>Acts</hi> 12. Where it is
affirmed, That the Church made <hi>continual interceſsion</hi> for <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
when he was impriſoned. But it is anſwered, None but
a Sophiſter, would object that to prove <hi>Peter</hi> Oecumenick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> inſtances. That they prayed not for <hi>James,</hi>
and <hi>Stephen:</hi> But it is anſwered, <hi>Thats far worſe Logick</hi> to
prove <hi>Peter</hi> Oecumenick Biſhop. Secondly, it is impious in
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> to affirm, That the Church did not pray for <hi>Stephen</hi>
and <hi>James:</hi> although it be not mentioned, he cares not what
he bable, becauſe all he ſpoke, was received as Goſpel by
his diſciples at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nineteenth Prerogative is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. where <hi>Peter
firſt ſpeaks, and all the reſt followed his opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered firſt, That <hi>Luke</hi> mentions, that there was
<hi>great debate amongſt them before Peter ſpake:</hi> and therefore it is
uncertain, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake firſt. Secondly, whereas they
call that <hi>ſpeaking of Peters, a pronouncing of the ſentence.</hi> It is
notoriouſly falſe, for <hi>Lyranus</hi> himſelf affirms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by <hi>James, verſe</hi> 19. as it was indeed. The reaſon they
give is, <hi>Becauſe James was Biſhop of the place.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Cardinal
Cart huſianus,</hi> upon <hi>Acts</hi> 15. expreſly affirms, That <hi>James pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
in the Council,</hi> which quite deſtroys <hi>the Supremacy of Peter</hi>
for an Oecumenick Biſhop, who hath the only right of preſiding
in <hi>Councils,</hi> either by himſelf, when he is preſent, or elſe by his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64826:111"/>
Legats, when he is abſent. Fourthly, in the <hi>Council of Baſil,</hi>
the Fathers of that Council denyed, that the Legats of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould preſide in that Council, becauſe they
never did read, that <hi>Peter</hi> did preſide in any Council. <hi>Turre-Cremata,
lib. 3. cap. 24. Summae de Eccleſ.</hi> affirms the ſame:
and for that reaſon <hi>Paul, Galat.</hi> 2. preferrs <hi>James</hi> to <hi>Peter;</hi>
whence appears that it is falſe, that <hi>Peter</hi> preſided in that
Council, and albeit he had preſided, it doth not conclude him
<hi>Oecumenick Biſhop:</hi> for it ſhal be proved, <hi>part.</hi> 2. and <hi>part</hi> 3.
that in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and other General Councils, that
thoſe who preſided in them were not Oecumenick Biſhops.</p>
               <p>The twenty Prerogative, and laſt Scriptural is, from <hi>Gala.</hi> 1.
where <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, That after three years, he went up to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
to ſee <hi>Peter.</hi> But it is anſwered, All who were viſited
by <hi>Paul,</hi> were not Oecumenick Biſhops: and here <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
miſerably ſophiſticats in the Fathers. And firſt, he cites <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomus,</hi>
affirming that the reaſon was, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> was
<hi>greater then himſelf.</hi> But it is anſwered, That <hi>Chryſoſtomus</hi>
words are <hi>elder then himſelf:</hi> for ſo he explains, <hi>greater then
himſelf,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that this is <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is evident, becauſe in the ſame place he affirms, <hi>That Paul
went to ſee Peter, not that he needed any thing from him, being
equal to him.</hi> He affirms alſo, <hi>I ſay no more,</hi> which is as much
as in his opinion, <hi>Paul was to be preferred to Peter.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he ſophiſticats in <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> whom he brings in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>the reaſon of that viſit,</hi> was, becauſe, <hi>Peter was the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</hi>
But it is anſwered, The meaning of <hi>Hieronymus</hi> is the
ſame with that of <hi>Chryſoſtomus by firſt Apoſtle,</hi> he means either
in <hi>age,</hi> or <hi>dignity,</hi> not in Juriſdiction, becauſe he expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
in the ſame place, That <hi>Paul</hi> came to ſee <hi>Peter, non diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendi
ſtudio, qui &amp; ipſe eundem praedication is haberet Autorem,
ſed honoris priori Apoſtolo deferendi, thas is not to learn any thing
from him, but to do him honor as the ſtrſt Apoſtle. Auguſtinus</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:64826:112"/>
expreſly calls it a <hi>faternal viſit,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Tertullianus.
Lombardus</hi> alſo affirms, The end of <hi>Paul</hi> viſit, was to ſhew
<hi>Peter</hi> that he was his <hi>Coapoſtolus,</hi> or <hi>fellow Apoſtle with him,</hi> not
<hi>to learn any thing from him. Aquinas,</hi> the other great Maſter of
the School-men, affirms the ſame, <hi>paraphraſing</hi> upon the words
of <hi>Paul,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Non ut diſcerem ab eo, ſed ut viſuarem eum,
not to learn from him, but to ſee him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we have waded through that immenſe Ocean of
that diſput of <hi>Bellarmins,</hi> concerning the Scriptural Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of <hi>Peter,</hi> in which we have omitted nothing of moment,
or what is worth the anſwering. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> alledgeth ſome teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Fathers, ſhewing to favor (as he cites them) ſome
of theſe Prerogatives of <hi>Peter:</hi> but he baſely ſophiſticats, as
we have given a <hi>Specimen</hi> in the chief of them, whoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
we have vindicated. He deludes his Reader in this, <hi>viz.</hi>
becauſe thoſe Fathers acknowledge ſome of thoſe Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
therefore by Sophiſtry, he would perſwade his Reader
that <hi>Peter</hi> was Oecumenick Biſhop in their opinion, which
was very far from their mind, as partly we have ſhewed in the
former chapters, and partly ſhall ſhew in the following.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="17" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XVII. Of the Prerogatives of Peter by Tradition.</head>
               <p>IN the former Chapter, we have diſputed the Scriptural
Prerogatives of <hi>Peter,</hi> twenty in number: now followeth
Prerogatives of <hi>Peter</hi> by <hi>tradition,</hi> which are eighth in
number. The firſt is, that <hi>Euodius,</hi> and ſome other affirm,
That <hi>Peter</hi> only of all the Apoſtles was baptized by the hands
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered firſt, That <hi>Euodius</hi> teſtimony is not much
to be regarded, <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf thinks it not to be written
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64826:112"/>
by <hi>Euodius,</hi> becauſe the author of it affirms, <hi>That</hi> Steven <hi>was
martyred ſeven years after the death of Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, he
ſaith, The houſe in which our Savior celebrated the Supper,
was in the houſe of <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, which directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts,
<hi>Matthew 26. Mark</hi> 14. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22. As for <hi>Bellarmins</hi>
other witneſſes, <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and <hi>Euthymius,</hi> they have it from
the ſaid ſuppoſititious <hi>Euodius:</hi> This <hi>Euodius</hi> was Patriarch
of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> immediatly after the times of the Apoſtles, at
leaſt called ſo, <hi>in a large ſenſe;</hi> For it ſhal be proved, <hi>part. 2.
lib.</hi> 1. that no Patriarchs were eſtabliſhed before the <hi>Council</hi>
of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Many of the Fathers expreſly affirm, That it is
falſe, that Chriſt baptized <hi>Peter.</hi> So <hi>Euthymius</hi> himſelf (after
he had recited the opinion of <hi>Euodius) Eulogius in Photius,
Biobliothec. cap. 280. Tertullianus, de Baptiſmo, cap. 12. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomus</hi>
on the <hi>Acts, homil.</hi> 1. who all affirm, That <hi>Peter</hi> and
the other Apoſtles were baptized by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt; Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus,
epiſt.</hi> 108. diſputs this queſtion, whither <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi>
baptized the Apoſtles? He is in doubt of it, but inclines
moſt to that opinion, that they were baptized by Chriſt. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
there is no <hi>prerogative</hi> in <hi>Peter</hi> there, ſince he
ſpeaks of the Baptiſm of all the Apoſtles as well as <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Although <hi>Peter</hi> had been baptized by Chriſt
alone and not the other Apoſtles, it doth not conclude him
to be <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Traditional prerogative,</hi> is, That only <hi>Peter</hi>
was ordained Biſhop by Chriſt, and the other Apoſtles by <hi>Peter</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, It is a meer fable, contradicted by <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostomus</hi>
on <hi>Matthew, hom.</hi> 5. Who affirms, That <hi>James firſt
obtained a Biſhoprick:</hi> if that be true, then he was a Biſhop
before <hi>Peter;</hi> And if before <hi>Peter,</hi> then he behoved to have
been made Biſhop by Chriſt, ſince <hi>Peter</hi> could not make <hi>James</hi>
a Biſhop, when he was not Biſhop himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:64826:113"/>
Secondly, It ſhal be proved in the laſt chapter of the book,
that neither <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any of the Apoſtles were Biſhops pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly:
but in a <hi>large ſenſe, as Biſhop comprehends Apoſtle,
Acts</hi> 1. 20. and in that ſenſe, Chriſt himſelf is called a Biſhop,
1. <hi>Peter</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Traditional prerogative,</hi> is, from <hi>Acts</hi> 8. Where
<hi>Peter</hi> detected <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> the <hi>tradition</hi> is, that after that
time, the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> extinguiſhed him.</p>
               <p>But is anſwered, Albeit it were true, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was
killed by <hi>Peter,</hi> it doth not conclude him <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop.
Bellarmin</hi> inſtances, <hi>That</hi> Simon Magus <hi>was Prince of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
whom</hi> Peter <hi>killed:</hi> Ergo, Peter <hi>was Oecumenick
Biſhop who killed him.</hi> But it is anſwered: Firſt, <hi>Bellarmins</hi>
Scholars at <hi>Rome,</hi> may well approve of this way of diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but it is laught at elſe where. Secondly, that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would conclude <hi>Paul</hi> to be <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> ſince <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus,
Catheſ. 6. Sulpitius, hiſt. Sacr. lib. 2. Ambroſius ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
66. attribute the killing of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> joyntly to <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That killing of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> by <hi>Peter,</hi> ſeems to
be a fable, ſince thoſe who reports it contradict other in the
manner. <hi>Hegeſipus, lib. 3. cap.</hi> 2. affirms, That <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus
made wings to himſelf, and fell a flying: Clemens, lib. 6.
cap.</hi> 9. affirms, That he had no wings, <hi>but only was carried in

of them, ſaith, <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> brake his neck in the fall, at the
Prayer of <hi>Peter:</hi> Others that he brake only his thigh-bone.</p>
               <p>Finally, All this ſtory of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> depends
upon <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome;</hi> but all the Ancients teſtimonies,
who teſtified <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> depends upon the authority
of <hi>Papias,</hi> whom <hi>Euſebius</hi> diſcrives to be the author of many
fables, as ſhal be ſhewed at large, in the laſt chapter of this
book. Where alſo it ſhal be proved, by unanſwerable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64826:113"/>
that <hi>Peter</hi> was never at <hi>Rome:</hi> and that all <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi>

               <p>The fourth <hi>Ttraditional prerogative</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> is, That <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by the command of Chriſt. fixed his Biſhoprick at</hi> Rome,
<hi>which was the imperial City:</hi> Ergo, Peter <hi>was Oecumenick
Biſhop.</hi> But it is anſwered: Firſt, it doth not follow: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> cannot prove by Scripture or Antiquity, <hi>That

this queſtion, if <hi>Peter</hi> were at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi>
Shal be diſputed in the three laſt chapters of this book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fifth</hi> traditional prerogative <hi>of</hi> Peter, <hi>is,</hi> That Chriſt
appeared to him at the end of his life, or a little before he dyed:
and when <hi>Peter</hi> asked him, whither he was going? <hi>He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
he was come again to be crucified.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered: Firſt, it contradicts Scripture, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<hi>Acts 3. 21. That the Heavens muſt contain him until
the day of Judgement.</hi> Secondly, the author of this fable is
<hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> faſly believed to be him, who lived in the days of
the Apoſtles; as <hi>Baronius</hi> affirms, <hi>anno 69. num. 7. Origines
hom.</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 37. calls it <hi>Appocryphal.</hi> And albeit it were true,
it doth not conclude <hi>Peter</hi> to be <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop:</hi> for <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
himſelf affirms, That our Savior left the Heavens, and
coming unto the Air, appeared unto <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9 4. and ſo
that argument would conclude <hi>Paul Oecumenick Biſhop</hi> alſo.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64826:114"/>
appeared to <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> to prove that <hi>Peter was at Rome;</hi>
when it is objected to him, <hi>Acts 3. 21. That the Heavens ſhould

                  </gap>ore contradicts Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
He anſwers, <hi>Chriſt appeared to</hi> Paul <hi>in the Air.</hi> But here
to prove <hi>Peter Oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> he affirms, <hi>That our Savior
after his Aſcenſion, left Heavenbut once, when he appeared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </hi>
Peter: Elſe he loſeth time in declaiming ſo much upon this
<hi>prerogative.</hi> For he muſt either deny that Chriſt appeared to
<hi>Paul</hi> out of the Heaven: or elſe he cannot affirm, without So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry,
that Chriſts appearing to <hi>Peter</hi> is a <hi>prerogative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſixth</hi> traditional prerogative <hi>of</hi> Peter, <hi>is,</hi> That only
theſe Churches were Patriarchal ſeats, which were founded by
<hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>Rome, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antiochia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is a notorious untruth, For not only <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but alſo many other Cities were <hi>Patriarchal
ſeats:</hi> His proofs are ſhameleſs. As firſt, the ſixth Canon of the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> which mentions only theſe three <hi>Patriarchal
ſeats;</hi> And likewiſe, the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon, Action</hi> 16. But
it is anſwered, theſe Councils mention only theſe three, in theſe
Canons cited by <hi>Bellarmin:</hi> but the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> mentions
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Canon 7. under the name of <hi>Aelia.</hi> As for the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> it mentions other <hi>Patriarchal ſeats,</hi> in
many places, as Canon 28. it mentions him of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
Likewiſe, the ſecond General <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at leaſt ten <hi>Patriarchal ſeats in the Eaſt.</hi> Secondly, if ye
take the word <hi>Patriarch ſtrictly,</hi> it ſhal be proved, <hi>part. 2.
lib.</hi> 2. that there was no <hi>Patriarch</hi> before the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
eſtabliſhed by Law. And therefore, it is falſe which
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms, That theſe three were ever held <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
ſeatsonly, becauſe they were founded by</hi> Peter; as ſhal be
proved at large, <hi>part. 2. lib.</hi> 2. Thirdly, It is falſe which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
<hi>viz. That thoſe Churches were called</hi> Patriarchal, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were founded by</hi> Peter: ſince it is notorious, that the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64826:114"/>
dignity of <hi>Biſhops, Metropolitans,</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs, depended
upon civil reſpects, and not upon their Apoſtolick founders.</hi> For
firſt, the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> had the firſt place, becauſe he was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of the <hi>Old imperial City:</hi> he of <hi>Constantinople</hi> the ſecond,
becauſe he was <hi>Biſhop of New Rome,</hi> as appears by the third
Canon of the ſecond General <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by the
28. Canon of the fourth General <hi>Council of Chalcedon,</hi> by the
36 Canon of the fifth General <hi>Council of Conſtantinople.</hi> As for
the other <hi>Patriarchs, Baronius</hi> himſelf, <hi>ad annum 39. num</hi> 10.
hath theſe words, <hi>Majores in inſtituendis ſedibus Eccleſiarum,
non aliam miſſe rationem, quàm ſecundum provinciarum divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem,
&amp; praerogativas à</hi> Romanis <hi>antea ſtabilitas, quam plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rima
ſunt exempla.</hi> And a little after, he affirms, <hi>That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
of</hi> Alexandria <hi>was preferred to him of</hi> Antioch, <hi>becauſe</hi>
Aegypt <hi>was</hi> praefectura Auguſtalis; <hi>And not</hi> Antioch, <hi>which was
only a proconſulat of</hi> Syria: And for that reaſon alſo, <hi>It was
preferred to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>becauſe</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was under the ſaid
proconſulat.</hi> But if <hi>Bellarmins</hi> prerogative of <hi>Peter</hi> hold good,
<hi>Antioch</hi> would be preferred to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> becauſe it was
founded by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter:</hi> and alſo to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was only founded by <hi>Mark.</hi> But more of this, <hi>part. 2.
lib.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh <hi>traditional prerogative</hi> is, <hi>The feaſt of the chair
of Peter, viz.</hi> that there was a Feſtival day obſerved in the
Church, of the inſtitution of <hi>Peter,</hi> in his Biſhoprick ever ſince
his time.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered: Firſt, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is very wary in this
objection, in ſpeaking of the <hi>Feaſt of Peters chair in general,
not nameing which chair in particular.</hi> Better hold his peace, for
this feaſt was in remembrance of <hi>Peters Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
and not of <hi>Rome.</hi> If this argument have any force, it proves
the <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Antioch <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop, and not the Biſhop of</hi>
Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:64826:115"/>
Secondly, It is notoriouſly falſe, <hi>That this feaſt was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the whole Church. Bellarmins</hi> proofs are <hi>Auguſtinus,
Sermon 15. de Sanctis:</hi> which book is proved by <hi>Eraſmus</hi> to
be forged; How ever it is of no moment, whether it be forged
or not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Baronius <hi>himſelf ſpeaking of</hi> Feaſts, in honor of
their Founders, or of Feaſts obſerved by Churches for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>affirms (ſpeaking of the Church of</hi> Rome) That the feaſt
of the foundation of that Church was late, and according to the
example of ſome Oriental Churches.</p>
               <p>The laſt prerogative of <hi>Peter,</hi> is, That in old Epiſtles called
<hi>Literae Formatae,</hi>—after theſe words, <hi>In the Name of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the name of <hi>Peter</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.
If ye anſwer, that it is but a late invention, <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
will produce an Epiſtle of <hi>Atticus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
But it is replyed, Several makes mention of theſe <hi>Literae</hi>
called <hi>Formatae;</hi> but of that ſort as they are mentioned by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi>
where the name of <hi>Peter</hi> is placed next after the <hi>Trinity;</hi>
in ſuch Letters, ye have no example of old, but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d: However it is of no moment, whether it be forged
or not? He that would ſee the proofs of its Forgery, let him
read <hi>Chameir</hi> upon this prerogative: However theſe <hi>formatae
literae,</hi> were conceived thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,

And thus we have purged that <hi>Augiae Stabulum,</hi> of that
diſput of <hi>Bellarmins,</hi> concerning the prerogatives of <hi>Peter;</hi>
And conſequently, anſwered all, what is objected by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
in this argument of prerogatives, for the ſupremacy of
<hi>Peter,</hi> which is the fourth general argument, proving him <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick

by all the Art they could, to prove the
<hi>ſupremacy of Peter</hi> by his <hi>prerogatives;</hi> moſt of
which were in his carriage. In this chapter, we

that he could not be <hi>Monarch of the Church ordained by

three. The firſt is this, it appears by <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 14: <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi>
John <hi>were delegated by the Apoſtles, who were in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to
preach the Goſpel in</hi> Samaria: but an <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

ſent the Holy Ghost:</hi> but that inſtance is ridiculous; not being
a <hi>Miſſion of like Nature</hi> with that of <hi>Peter from the other

The beſt ſolution of all is given by <hi>Renatus</hi> a Sorboniſt,
who grants, that <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent by the other Apoſtles, as <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat,</hi>
and leſs in authority then they. But (ſaith he) it doth not
follow he was not Oecumenick Biſhop; <hi>becauſe the authority of
the whole Church, is more then the authority of an Oecumenick
Biſhop.</hi> It cannot be denyed, that this anſwer of <hi>Renatus</hi> takes
away the force of the Argument. But it is much doubted, that
this anſwer is owned at <hi>Rome:</hi> ſince the doctrine of the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church of Rome</hi> (the infallibiliy of which is defended by
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> and all the <hi>Italians</hi>) is, <hi>that the authority of the Biſhop
of Rome is above a General Council:</hi> which after many debates
and oppoſitions in the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> at laſt
was concluded in the Council of <hi>Florence:</hi> whence the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is yet in force againſt the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
although not againſt <hi>Renatus,</hi> and others of his opinion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument againſt the Supremacy of <hi>Peter,</hi> from
his carriage, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 3. where <hi>he was challenged by the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
for going in to men uncircumciſed.</hi> The Argument is this,
<hi>An Oecumenick Biſhop cannot be queſtioned for any thing he
doth; but</hi> Peter <hi>was queſtioned:</hi> Ergo, <hi>He was not an Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Biſhop.</hi> The firſt propoſition is proved from the Canon
Law, in <hi>Gratianus, Diſtinct.</hi> 40. Canon <hi>Si Papa.</hi> Where it
is expreſly affirmed, and likewiſe, <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> 19. and <hi>Cauſ. 17.

By which it appears expreſly, that none will queſtion
an Oecumenick Biſhop. And Since <hi>Peter</hi> was queſtioned by
thoſe men, it is evident, they did not acknowledge him Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick
Biſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin, lib. 1. cap.</hi> 16. mentions this Argument, but
doth not anſwer it, but falls <hi>in a digreſsion,</hi> endeavoring to
prove, that <hi>Peter was not ignorant of that myſtery, of the calling
of the Gentiles before that viſion, Acts</hi> 10. but he ſeems expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to contradict Scripture, as appears to any having the uſe of
reaſon, conſidering both that viſion, and alſo his ſpeech mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with <hi>Cornelius, verſe</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>Stapletonin Relect. Controverſ. 3. quaeſt. 1. art. 3. <hi>and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places anſwers,</hi> That it is the duty of a good Paſtor to ſhow
himſelf ready, to give an account of his actions, to any who calls
them in queſtion.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, <hi>Stapleton</hi> ſaith truth, and <hi>Peter</hi> ſo in the
ſame place: but he takes not away the force of the Argument,
ſince in the ſore-cited paſſages of the Canon Law, it is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the Pope himſelf, <hi>to call what he doth in queſtion,</hi> ſince
he is bound to give an account of his actions to no <hi>power earthly,</hi>
either <hi>ſpiritual</hi> or <hi>temporal,</hi> but only to God.</p>
               <p>The third Argument is almoſt like the ſecond, but more
puzling, It is then from <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 11. where the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
affirms, <hi>That in Antiochia he reſiſted Peter to his face, for he was
to be blamed;</hi> which quite deſtroys the Supremacy of <hi>Peter</hi> in
two particulars: Firſt, <hi>that he was blamed and reſiſted.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>That he was deſervedly reſiſted.</hi> This objection puts the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Doctors by the ears together how to anſwer it? The moſt
ingenuous among them confeſs, that <hi>Paul</hi> in thoſe words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<hi>thought himſelf equal to Peter; otherwiſe, he durſt not
have ſpoken them.</hi> So <hi>Lombardus. Cajetanus</hi> affirms, That
<hi>Paul</hi> in theſe words, <hi>thought himſelf greater then</hi> Peter. The
other Doctors anſwer variouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:64826:118"/>
                  <hi>And firſt,</hi> Carerius <hi>and</hi> Pighius, <hi>following</hi> Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,
<hi>mentioned by</hi> Euſebius, hiſt. lib. 1. cap. 14. <hi>affirms,</hi>
That it was not <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, but an other <hi>Cephas,</hi> who was
reprehended by <hi>Paul. But this opinion is ridiculous; for</hi> Paul
is comparing himſelf in thoſe words, to the chief of the Apoſtles,
one of which was <hi>Peter: whereby it is evident, that it was</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Apoſtle whom he reſiſted, and not an other <hi>Peter; and
therefore this opinion is exploded by</hi> Hieronymus, <hi>and other
Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond anſwer, is of</hi> Gregorius de Valentia, Pighius,
<hi>and</hi> Carerius, <hi>following</hi> Chryſoſtomus, <hi>and</hi> Hieronymus, <hi>affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi>
That it was but a diſsimulation, and the reprehenſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from <hi>Paul,</hi> by paction between him and <hi>Peter: viz.</hi> That
<hi>Peter (the Jews arriving</hi>) ſhould leave the Gentiles, that <hi>Paul</hi>
might have occaſion to reprehend him: <hi>And conſequently,</hi> that
the Jews might be inſtructed of the calling of the Gentiles by
<hi>Pauls</hi> reprehenſion.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, This Argument is laught at by <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus,</hi>
as not becoming <hi>the gravity of Paul, who had ſworn
before, that he lyed not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others affirm, That <hi>Peter erred not in faith,</hi> (ſo <hi>Sanderus,
and Stapleton</hi>) but only in <hi>converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, The leſs his error was by the ſaid repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
the leſs it appears he was <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop:</hi> for if
<hi>he erred not in faith, no body ſhould have preſumed to reſiſt him,
as is expreſly forbidden, by the fore-cited Canons of the Canon
Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> anſwers, That <hi>Peter erred not at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But it is falſe,
<hi>and gives the lye unto the Apoſtle Paul,</hi> who affirms, He was
to be <hi>blamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bellarmin <hi>anſwers another way,</hi> viz. That one may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
another, although ſuperior in Authority, if it be done with
reverence, <hi>as</hi> Paul did Peter here. <hi>He cites</hi> Auguſtinus, epiſt. 19
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64826:118"/>
                  <hi>to</hi> Hieronymus, <hi>and</hi> Gregorius Magnus, homil. 18. <hi>on</hi> Ezekiel,
<hi>who expreſly affirms,</hi> That Peter was greater then <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet
he was reprehended by him.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, That takes not away the force of the
argument: Firſt, becauſe the queſtion is not, <hi>Whether Peter
was greater then Paul? But whether he was Oecumenick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop?
Bellarmin</hi> will not affirm, That an <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop may
be reprehended;</hi> elſe he will not only contradict the <hi>Canon Law,</hi>
(as we ſhewed, and which they make of equal authority with
the Scripture) but alſo himſelf, <hi>lib. 4. cap 5. de Pont. Rom.</hi>
where he affirms, <hi>That if the Pope command Vice, and forbid
Vertue, the Church is bound to believe that Vice is Vertue, and
Vertue Vice.</hi> Secondly, it expreſly appears by the words of
<hi>Paul, Gal. 2. That he made himſelf equal to Peter,</hi> as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by the <hi>ordinar gloſs, Lombardus, Cajetanus:</hi> yea,
<hi>Chryſoſtomus;</hi> after he hath gathered from the words of <hi>Paul,</hi>
that he was equal to <hi>Peter;</hi> he adds, <hi>Ne dicam amplius,</hi> by
which words, he thinks <hi>Paul was greater then Peter.</hi> Thirdly,
The Doctrine of <hi>Paul</hi> was preferred to that of <hi>Peter,</hi> that of
<hi>Peter</hi> being found <hi>diſſimulation,</hi> and that of <hi>Paul ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is needleſs to examine the anſwers of others, as of <hi>Stap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton</hi>
and <hi>Eckius,</hi> yet we will mention two other anſwers. The
one of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> the other of Cardinal <hi>Pool;</hi> that of <hi>Aquinas,</hi>
and <hi>Eckius</hi> is almoſt all one, <hi>viz. They grant that</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi>
Paul <hi>was alike.</hi> But they diſtinguiſh, <hi>that Paul was equal to</hi>
Peter <hi>in the execution of authority, but not in authority of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in executione Autoritatis, non in autoritate regiminis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, This diſtinction of <hi>Thomas</hi> is a plain
riddle: It would puzle <hi>Oedipus</hi> himſelf. It is ordinar with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters
to imitate that fiſh, <hi>called Sepia:</hi> when it is caught, it
vomits up a black humor like ink, to deceive the fiſhers: none
can conceive this diſtinction of <hi>Thomas</hi> without contradiction.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64826:119"/>
For if <hi>Paul</hi> were equal to <hi>Peter in the execution of Authority:</hi> he
was equal alſo to him <hi>in the authority of Government;</hi> ſince
the execution of Authority is the Act flowing from the other,
or from the Authority of Government: if the ſame be the
<hi>authority</hi> of both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul?</hi> This cantradiction is inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
but if the Authority of <hi>Peter</hi> be greater then that of
<hi>Paul,</hi> he ſtill contradicts himſelf, in affirming <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>equal</hi>
to <hi>Peter</hi> in the execution of authority, no ſubordinat Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat
can be <hi>equal</hi> in the execution of Authority to the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magiſtrat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eckius</hi> diſtinguiſheth more to the purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> between the
Office of an Apoſtle in <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>governing. Paul</hi> was equal
to <hi>Peter</hi> the firſt way, and therefore, he reprehended him, not
<hi>the ſecond way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is replyed firſt, Albeit this diſtinction were granted,
it doth not take away the force of the Argument: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in this, whether <hi>Paul</hi> were greater or leſs then <hi>Peter?</hi> it is
nothing to the purpoſe? An <hi>Oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> according to
the Canon Law, ought to be queſtioned by none: and ſince
<hi>Paul</hi> queſtioned <hi>Peters</hi> actions, it is evident according to the
doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> was not <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Biſhop:</hi> neither is it of any moment, that the Canon Law
provides, <hi>that a Pope may be queſtioned for Hereſie:</hi> ſince that
ſort of queſtioning is antiquated by the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi>
and the conſtant Practice of the Modern Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
Neither was the error of <hi>Peter</hi> an <hi>Hereſie,</hi> but only <hi>an action</hi> of
<hi>diſsimulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the diſtinction of it ſelf is contradictory for two
reaſons. Firſt, becauſe <hi>Government of the Church pertains to
the office of an Apoſtle,</hi> all the Apoſtles <hi>having exerciſed all the
parts of that Government.</hi> Secondly, this reprehenſion of
<hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>directly in execution of the authority of Government,</hi>
becauſe Government comprehends reprehenſion of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64826:119"/>
both in doctrine and manners, or actions. But in this
particular, the actions of <hi>Peter</hi> were reprehended by <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> a very Learned man, retorts the Argument,
<hi>lib. 2. de unitate Eccleſiae,</hi> where he affirms, <hi>This reprehenſion
of Peter by Paul, concludes Peter to be Oecumenick Biſhop:</hi> but
he tells not how? <hi>Baronius</hi> (it ſeems) explains him, <hi>anno 53.
num.</hi> 46. the argument is very pretty, <hi>viz. They who followed
the example of</hi> Peter <hi>Judaizing, preferred it to the decree of the
Council of</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>Ergo, they believed his authority was above
that of the Council, and of</hi> Paul; yea <hi>Barnabas himſelf followed
Peter before either the Council or Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered (to omit that it is not certain, whether
this diſſimulation of <hi>Peters</hi> was before or after the Council of
<hi>Jeruſalem) Baronius</hi> had reaſoned far better thus, <hi>Paul prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the decree of the Council to the fact of Peter, reprehending
Peter in his face,</hi> Ergo; <hi>Peter was not Oecumenick Biſhop.</hi> For
albeit thoſe <hi>Judaizing</hi> had preferred the example of <hi>Peter</hi> to
the decree of the Council: it doth not follow, that <hi>Peter was
above a Council,</hi> except they had <hi>rightly preferred the example
of</hi> Peter <hi>to the decree of the Council.</hi> And this much of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Inſtitution. We have omitted hitherto
nothing of moment, pretended by either ſide, aſſaulting, or
aſſerting the Supremacy of <hi>Peter</hi> from his <hi>Inſtitution, Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives</hi>
and <hi>Carriage.</hi> It remains only now to diſput the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of <hi>Peter, pro</hi> and <hi>contra,</hi> by teſtimonies of Fathers.
And firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we will examin the teſtimonies of <hi>Bellarmin, cap. 19.
&amp;</hi> 20. where he uſeth many repetitions, (according to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom)

               <head>CHAP. XIX. Teſtimonies of Fathers examined, ſeeming to prove the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Peter over the Church.</head>
               <p>HItherto our adverſaries have diſputed the ſupremacy of
<hi>Peter</hi> from his inſtitution, prerogatives and carriage,
now they endeavour, to prove it by teſtimonies of
Fathers, from which they muſter up an army of Teſtimonies,
in number 24. which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirms to be the Oracles
of the 24 Elders in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and that nothing can
be anſwered to thoſe teſtimonies, except that anſwer of
<hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> to the teſtimonies of <hi>Leo,</hi> (viz.) <hi>that they
were men, and conſequently might erre:</hi> but it will appear,
by the Proteſtants anſwers, that theſe teſtimonies are not ſo
invincible. All thoſe teſtimonies may be reduced to two
general Claſſes; the firſt is, in which <hi>Peter</hi> is compared with
the whole Church; the ſecond, wherein he is compared with
the other Apoſtles: the firſt Claſſe again is ſubdivided in
ſeveral ſorts, according to the diverſity of attributes given
to <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt kind, are thoſe teſtimonies wherein Chriſt ſaith
to <hi>Peter, upon this Rock,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>feed my Sheep, I will give to
thee the Keys,</hi> &amp;c. which is the third time that <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
hath repeated them; and therefore it is ſufficient to anſwer,
as before, that nothing was given peculiar to <hi>Peter;</hi> as was
not only aſſerted by thoſe Fathers mentioned by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
as <hi>Origen</hi> and others, but likewayes proved by
them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort are of thoſe Fathers affirming, <hi>that the care of
the whole Church was committed to</hi> Peter, which he proves by the
teſtimonies of <hi>Chryſoſtomus,</hi> in his his 55. Homile upon
<hi>Matthew,</hi> where <hi>Peter</hi> is called <hi>Paſtor Eccleſiae, Paſtor of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64826:121"/>
Church:</hi> and likewayes of <hi>Maximus</hi> ſermon 3. <hi>de Apoſtolis,</hi>
of <hi>Gregorius, lib. 4. epiſt.</hi> 32. who both affirm, <hi>that the care
of the whole Church was committed to</hi> Peter.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, ſo was it to all the Apoſtles in thoſe
words, <hi>Go and teach all Nations, Matth. 28. 2. Chryſoſtomus</hi>
in many places affirms, that <hi>Paul</hi> had a care of the whole
World, that he had <hi>Orbis praefecturam, Homilia</hi> 22. in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
And likewayes, that all the Apoſtles had the care of the
whole Church, <hi>Hom.</hi> 87. upon <hi>John:</hi> he likewayes affirms,
that <hi>Timothy</hi> governed the whole World, <hi>Hom.</hi> 1. to the
people of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and likewayes that <hi>Timothy</hi> took upon
him <hi>praefecturam totius orbis, Orat.</hi> 6. againſt the Jews: whereby
it appears, that by <hi>Peters having care of the whole Church,</hi> he is
not proved to be oecumenick Biſhop, ſince others had the
ſame care of the whole Church. Nevertheleſſe, <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
uſeth two cheats, the firſt is in citing <hi>Chryſoſtomus,</hi> calling
<hi>Peter Paſtor of the whole Church,</hi> whereas the Greek imports
only <hi>he erected his mind, and made him Paſtor:</hi> his ſecond
cheat is; in citing <hi>Gregorius,</hi> as if his meaning were, that
<hi>Peter</hi> was oecumenick Biſhop, becauſe the care of the whole
Church was committed to him; whereas it is notorious, that
<hi>Gregorius</hi> in thoſe words, is diſputing againſt an oecumenick
Biſhop; amongſt other reaſons he brings for one, <hi>although
the care of the whole Church was committed to</hi> Peter, <hi>yet he
was not univerſal Apoſtle;</hi> which laſt words <hi>Bellarmine</hi> frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently
ſupreſſeth.</p>
               <p>The third rank of teſtimonies are thoſe, calling <hi>Peter head
of the Church:</hi> as of <hi>Chryſoſtomus,</hi> Hom. 55. on Matth. <hi>of
Cyprianus</hi> ad <hi>Jubaianum;</hi> of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſermon 125. <hi>de tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore;</hi>
of <hi>Hugo Ethereanus, lib.</hi> 3. againſt the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, firſt, that thoſe teſtimonies prove
nothing: as for <hi>Cyprianus,</hi> he is not ſpeaking of <hi>Peter</hi> at all;
his words are only <hi>Eccleſiae unius caput, &amp; radicem tenemus;</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:64826:121"/>
that is, <hi>we abide in the unity of the Church, which is one, and
head of the faithful:</hi> But of this teſtimony, more hereafter:
It is ſufficient to tell for the preſent, that <hi>Pamelius</hi> (who
uſeth to catch the leaſt advantages for the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter</hi>)
in his Annotations upon thoſe words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> mentions
nothing to that purpoſe; as for <hi>Chryſoſtomus,</hi> he calls not
<hi>Peter head of the Church</hi> at all; it is only <hi>Trapizuntius</hi> who
tranſlates him unfaithfully: as for <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> thoſe books
<hi>de tempore,</hi> no learned man will affirm to be his, for two
reaſons, the firſt is, becauſe he calls <hi>Peter</hi> the foundation,
not only of the Church, but alſo of the Faith, which is far
from <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> mind, who interprets the <hi>Rock</hi> or <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
not to be <hi>Peter,</hi> at all; for which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others
tax him of ignorance, as we ſaid before. The ſecond reaſon
is, becauſe he calls <hi>Peters</hi> denying of Chriſt, <hi>Exiguum
peccatum,</hi> a ſmall ſin, but non aggravates it more then <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus:</hi>
as for <hi>Hugo Ethereanus,</hi> he lived but of late in the
twelfth Age, according to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> but in the fifteenth
according to others; and therefore, his teſtimony can no
more be regarded by the Proteſtants, then the teſtimony of
<hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> by <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, albeit <hi>Peter</hi> were proved to be <hi>head of the Church</hi>
by thoſe teſtimonies, it doth not prove that he was <hi>oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Biſhop;</hi> becauſe others beſide <hi>Peter,</hi> are alſo called
<hi>heads of the Church</hi> by the Fathers; <hi>Martyrius</hi> is called
<hi>Praeſes and head of the Church, epiſt. 1. incert. Patriarch, in
corpore juris graeco Romani. Athanaſius</hi> is called <hi>head of all men,</hi>
by <hi>Baſilius, epiſt. 52. Paul</hi> is called <hi>head of nations,</hi> by
<hi>Gregorius,</hi> 1. in his fourth book upon <hi>Kings 1. James</hi> and
<hi>John</hi> are likewiſe called <hi>heads</hi> by <hi>Chryſoſtomus,</hi> in his 26. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile</hi>
upon the <hi>Acts:</hi> yea, all Paſtors and Doctors are called <hi>heads</hi>
by <hi>Gregorius</hi> ſecond Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the ſecond Synod of <hi>Neice.</hi> By which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64826:122"/>
teſtimonies it appears, that the words <hi>Caput</hi> or <hi>head</hi>
infers not an oecumenick Biſhop, but either a primacy of
order, or rather eminency in gifts; and ſo it is taken by
<hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>The fourth rank of teſtimonies are thoſe, ſtiling <hi>Peter
Biſhop of the Chriſtians, Chriſtianorum Pontifex primus:</hi>
for which, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> produceth <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Chron,
anno.</hi> 44.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, firſt, that there are no ſuch words
in the Greek text of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> reſtored by <hi>Scaliger.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
although it were proved by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> it doth not conclude
that <hi>Peter</hi> was oecumenick Biſhop, becauſe it appears that
<hi>Cyprianus (epiſt.</hi> 69.) when he was demanded to have him
<hi>Martyred,</hi> was called <hi>Epiſcopus Chriſtianorum, Biſhop of the
Chriſtians;</hi> but (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine) Peter</hi> was called by
<hi>Euſebius, firſt Biſhop of the Chriſtians;</hi> but not ſo <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prianus.</hi>
But, (ſay the proteſtants) the word <hi>Firſt,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
only a priority of order, dignity or time, and not of
juriſdiction; many of the Fathers gave to <hi>Peter</hi> that title of
<hi>Firſt,</hi> or <hi>primus,</hi> becauſe they believed that he was firſt
ordained Apoſtle; ſo <hi>Cyprianus, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fifth rank of teſtimonies are thoſe, affirming that
there is</hi> Una Cathedra, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one Chair of <hi>Peter:</hi> which was
placed at <hi>Rome;</hi> in which Chair, Unity was preſerved by all,
neither did the reſt of the Apoſtles conſtitute any other Chairs
againſt that one Chair in which <hi>Peter</hi> ſat firſt: <hi>To whom
ſucceeded</hi> Linus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Optatus, lib. 2. <hi>againſt</hi> Parmenianus;
in which words (<hi>ſaith</hi> Bellarmine) ye have the Chair of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and his ſucceſſors, called <hi>the Chair of the whole Church,</hi>
which infers, that according to <hi>Optatus, Peter</hi> was oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Biſhop.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, that <hi>Optatus</hi> in thoſe words, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
againſt the Donatiſts, who had ſet up a Biſhop of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64826:122"/>
their own faction at <hi>Rome,</hi> in oppoſition to the true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop:
<q>Which <hi>Optatus</hi> reprehends, Becauſe (ſaith he)
there is but one Chair at <hi>Rome</hi> founded by <hi>Peter;</hi> in
which firſt himſelf ſat, and then his ſucceſſors; in which
place, (<hi>viz.) Rome,</hi> none of the other Apoſtles did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
another Chair, much leſſe ye ought to ſet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Biſhop in that Chair, in oppoſition to the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </q> That this is his meaning (<hi>viz.</hi>) that he
ſpeaks of the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not of the
univerſal Church, is evident, becauſe otherwayes it were
notoriouſly falſe which he affirms, <hi>that no Chair was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
by the other Apoſtles: For</hi> James <hi>did conſtitute a Church
at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixth rank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the teſtimonies affirming <hi>Peter</hi> to
be <hi>Magiſter Eccleſiae, a Maſter of the Church;</hi> likewayes,
that the Church is called, <hi>Ecleſia Petri,</hi> Ambroſius, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
11.</p>
               <p>It is anſwered, firſt, that not only <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> but alſo
<hi>Coſterus</hi> (a ſtiff maintainer of the Pope) denyes <hi>Ambroſius</hi>
to be the Author of thoſe Sermons. 2. Although he were,
it imports not much for calling <hi>Peter a Maſter of the Church,</hi>
he calls him no other thing then an Apoſtle; For all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
governed the whole Church, or were Paſtors of the
whole Church, as we ſaid before. 3. Whereas we ſaid
another calleth the Church, <hi>the Church of</hi> Peter, he
ſpeaks very improperly; ſuch kind of ſpeaking is not found
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or in Fathers: perhaps his meaning is, that
it is the Church of <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe it was the Church in
which <hi>Peter</hi> taught, and in that ſenſe it may be called the
Church of <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, or of any other of the Apoſtles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
properly the Church is only the Church of Chriſt, and
of none other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſeventh rank is, of teſtimonies preferring the Chair
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64826:123"/>
of</hi> Peter <hi>to-other Chairs,</hi> Auguſtinus, de Baptiſmo, lib. 2.
<hi>It is anſwered,</hi> Auguſtins <hi>words are,</hi> Quis neſcit, Apſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus
principatum cuilibet Epiſcopatui praeferendum? Who
is ignorant, that the principality <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the Apoſtleſhip is to be
preferred to any Biſhoprick? <hi>In which words, it cannot be
conjectured what</hi> Bellarmine <hi>can gatherfor the Supremacy of</hi>
Peter? Auguſtine <hi>in theſe words, is comparing</hi> Cyprian <hi>with</hi>
Peter <hi>in one reſpect, he prefers</hi> Peter <hi>to</hi> Cyprian, <hi>becauſe
(ſaith he</hi>) the principality of the Apoſtleſhip is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to any Biſhoprick, or <hi>Peter, becauſe an Apoſtle is
to be preferred to</hi> Cyprian, <hi>who is only a Biſhop. But in
the words following, he ſaith,</hi> Albeit their Chairs be
unequal, yet the glory of both the Martyrs is the ſame, <hi>in
which words he ſeems in a manner equal to</hi> Peter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Bellarmine <hi>cites a teſtimony from the</hi> Theſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
<hi>of</hi> Cyrullus <hi>for the Supremacy of</hi> Peter, (viz.) That
Chriſt got the Scepter of the Church of the Gentiles from
God, which he gave unto <hi>Peter</hi> and unto his ſucceſſors only, and
unto none other.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, that the teſtimony is ſuppoſitious
and forged, being not found at all in any Edition of that
Book: It is only mentioned by <hi>Thomas Aquinas, in Opuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo,
contra Graecos,</hi> in his little Book he wrote againſt the
Graecians, and ſome think he forged it: but <hi>Thomas</hi> was a
moſt holy man, and it is more like he was abuſed by ſome
others.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cites ſome teſtimonies from <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
and others, who lived after the ſixth Century; but
thoſe teſtimonies, eſpecially of the Latines, who lived at
that time, cannot be regarded, becauſe they lived after
that time in which <hi>Bonifacius</hi> 3. was ordained oecumenick
Biſhop by <hi>Phocas:</hi> Such teſtimonies for the Supremacy of
<hi>Peter,</hi> can have no more force, then the teſtimonies of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64826:123"/>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or <hi>Barronius,</hi> or any other Doctor of the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, he cites the teſtimonies of <hi>Leo,</hi> and the other
Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> but neither can thoſe be regarded, becauſe
they lived after the time in which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> contended for the primacy. If
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not believe the Proteſtants, that thoſe
teſtimonies are of no moment; let him conſider what is
ſaid by <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> (ſometimes Pope himſelf) who in
his firſt Comen, upon the Councill of <hi>Baſil,</hi> hath theſe
words, <hi>Thoſe miſerable men are not aware, that thoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
which they ſo magnify, are either (ipſorum ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum,
Pontificum Fimbrias ſuas extendentium) Are
either of Popes themſelves enlarging their authority, or elſe of
their flatterers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmines</hi> eleventh teſtimony, is taken from <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Caeſarienſis, lib. 2. hiſt. cap.</hi> 14. who affirms, <hi>Peter</hi>
is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Captain of the Militia
of God.</hi> In which teſtimony, he triumphs as if he had
found out the whole buſineſſe; <hi>What elſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>can
be the meaning of</hi> Euſebius, <hi>then that</hi> Peter <hi>is head of the Church
Militant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, firſt, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (following
the verſion of <hi>Chriſtopherſon</hi>) cites <hi>Euſebius</hi> fraudulently,
whoſe words are not, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

That is, <hi>Not Captain of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
of God</hi> [ſimply.] But, <hi>as one of the Captains of the
Militia of God.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Iſidorus Peluſtota, lib. 3. epiſt.</hi>

and valiant Captain, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and conſequently,
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> triumphs before the Victory, ſince that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Euſebius</hi> concludes <hi>Peter</hi> no more to be oecumenick
Biſhop, then that of <hi>Iſidorus, Paul.</hi> And this much of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64826:124"/>
thoſe teſtimonies cited by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for proving the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy

               <p>THe ſecond Claſſe of teſtimonies, conſiſts of thoſe,
proving the Supremacy of <hi>Peter</hi> over the Apoſtles,
for which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cites <hi>Cyprian, epiſt.</hi> 71. but
he ſets not down the words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but only ſumms them
thus, <hi>When</hi> Paul <hi>reprehended</hi> Peter, Peter <hi>did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
I have the primacy, ye moſt obey me, and not I
you: Ergo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bellarmine, according to</hi> Cyprian, Peter <hi>had
the primacy over</hi> Paul.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, that this Logick is very ſtrange,
becauſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirms, that <hi>Peter</hi> did not ſay unto <hi>Paul,
I have the primacy;</hi> Ergo, <hi>according to</hi> Cyprian, Peter
<hi>had the Supremacy.</hi> It would ſeem rather by theſe words,
that <hi>Cyprian</hi> thought <hi>Peter</hi> had not the Supremacy. The
words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> (which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſuppreſſeth) are,
<hi>Nec</hi> Petrus <hi>vendicavit ſibi, aliquid inſolenter aut ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roganter
aſſumpſit, ut diceret ſe primatum tenere,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That is, <hi>Peter</hi> being reprehended by <hi>Paul,</hi> did not
take any thing to himſelf inſolently or arrogantly, as to
ſay, he had the primacy; from which words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> it
followes rather, that if <hi>Peter</hi> had ſaid to <hi>Paul, he had the
primacy,</hi> he had been arrogant and inſolent; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it appears rather that <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in theſe words, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
<hi>Peter</hi> to have the Supremacy: It ſeems <hi>Pamelius</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
him ſo, for he anſwers (in his Annotations upon
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64826:124"/>
that place) this very paſſage of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as an objection
againſt the Supremacy of <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the next place,</hi> Bellarmine <hi>brings a number of very ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
teſtimonies, to prove the Supremacy of</hi> Peter <hi>over the
other Apoſtles, as that</hi> Baſilius <hi>affirms,</hi> he was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the other Apoſtles; <hi>Nazianzenus,</hi> That the other Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
were inferiour to him; <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that he was Captain
of the Apoſtles; <hi>Cyrillus Hieroſolym,</hi> that he was prince of
the Apoſtles; <hi>Cyrillus, Allexand.</hi> That he was Prince
and head of the reſt; <hi>Theophyl.</hi> Prince of the diſciples; <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius,</hi>
he obtained the precedency of the other Apoſtles; <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus,</hi>
he was choſen head of the twelve, that occaſion of
Schiſme might be removed: <hi>The Author of the queſtion
upon the Old and New Teſtament, placed amongſt the
works of</hi> Auguſtinus, he was made their head, that he might be
Paſtor of the flock of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thoſe teſtimonies in effect, at the firſt veiw, ſeem to be of
moment, but well conſidered do not prove at all, that <hi>Peter</hi>
had any juriſdiction over the other Apoſtles; or that he was
their oecumenick Biſhop, for two very relevant reaſons. The
firſt is, becauſe thoſe very Epithets are given by the Fathers,
yea by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf to other Apoſtles, beſide <hi>Peter.</hi> But
ſince thoſe Appellations doth not prove thoſe other Apoſtles
oecumenick Biſhops; no more can they prove <hi>Peter</hi> to be
ſuch. That thoſe Titles were given to others beſide <hi>Peter,</hi> is
proved by thoſe following teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>Paul in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> calls <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Pillars, as
well as <hi>Peter;</hi> whereby it appears, he makes them equal
with <hi>Peter: Euſebius Emiſſenus, Homilia in Natal.</hi> Petri
&amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>auli, calls <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Andrew Princes of the Apoſtles. Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus,
lib. 2. cap. 1. hiſt.</hi> calls <hi>James Prince of the Apoſtles.</hi>
Chryſoſtom in <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. calls <hi>Paul, Prince of the Apoſtles
Prudentius</hi> calls <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul Princes of the Apoſtles.</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64826:125"/>
thoſe very Fathers who give thoſe elegies to <hi>Peter;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that the Church was built on all the Apoſtles, as well
as <hi>Peter;</hi> and ſome of them expreſly gives the chief of them
(as head) (or <hi>Caput</hi>) to others beſide <hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>Baſilius,</hi>
which we mentioned before.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon wherefore thoſe titles (of <hi>head,</hi> or
<hi>Prince</hi>) prove not any juriſdiction of <hi>Peter</hi> over the other
Apoſtles, is very relevant, and is this (<hi>viz.</hi>) the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals
of the Fathers expreſly affirm, that <hi>Peter</hi> had no juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over the other Apoſtles. <hi>Origenes, the Apoſtles were
Kings,</hi> and Chriſt, (not <hi>Peter) King of Kings. Cyprianus</hi>
de unitate eccleſiae, <hi>Chriſt after his reſurrection, gave a like
power unto all the Apoſtles:</hi> and a little after, <hi>what ever</hi>
Peter <hi>was, the other Apoſtles were the ſame, and had equal
fellowſhip with him, both in honour and power: Chryſoſtomus,</hi>
in <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. Paul <hi>needed not the teſtimony of</hi> Peter; <hi>he was
equal to him in honour, I will ſay no more</hi> whereby it is
evident, in his opinion, <hi>Paul</hi> was more honourable then
<hi>Peter.</hi> Likewayes, <hi>Hom.</hi> 66. in <hi>Matth. None goeth before</hi>
Paul, <hi>neither doth any doubt of it. Hieronymus, Galat.</hi> 2. para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſing
on <hi>Pauls</hi> words, ſaith, <hi>I am nothing inferiour to</hi>
Peter, <hi>we are both placed in the miniſtry by the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
(viz.</hi>) Chriſt. Likewayes, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. againſt <hi>Jovinian,
the Church is founded upon all the Apoſtles equally, all of them
got the keys of the Kingdom of heaven alike.</hi> Auguſtinus,
<hi>epiſt.</hi> 86. Peter <hi>and the other diſciples lived in concord together;</hi>
where obſerve, <hi>Peter</hi> is called <hi>condiſciple</hi> with the reſt.
<hi>Gregorius</hi> firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> himſelf diſputing againſt
an oecumenick Biſhop, <hi>lib. 4. epiſt.</hi> 32. amongſt the
other reaſons, brings this for one, <hi>although the care of the
whole Church was committed to</hi> Peter, <hi>yet</hi> Peter <hi>was not oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick
or univerſal Apoſtle.</hi> Other teſtimonies might be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64826:125"/>
heaped to this purpoſe, as of <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. and likewayes of <hi>Primaſius, Theophylactus,</hi> and the
ordinar Gloſſe, who all of them affirm the ſame upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And thus it is proved by two unanſwerable reaſons, that by
thoſe titles of <hi>Head and Prince, Peter</hi> is not oecumenick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.
Of that title of <hi>head,</hi> we ſpake before, that it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto others, as well as unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and now have proved
the ſame of the title of <hi>Prince.</hi> If ye ask then, what is the
meaning of thoſe expreſſions of the Fathers, calling <hi>Peter
Prince and Head of the Church or Apoſtles?</hi> It is anſwered,
the word <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> may import a threefold Primacy,
1. of Juriſdiction, and in that ſenſe, none but Chriſt is called
<hi>head</hi> or <hi>prince</hi> of the Church. 2. A primacy of Order with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Juriſdiction, as when any of the ſame Colledge chooſeth
one to be their Head, as Deacons chooſing an Arch-deacon,
who hath only primacy of Order, and not of Juriſdiction 3. A
primacy of gifts or graces; ſo the title <hi>head</hi> is taken 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
ſo alſo <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> &amp;c. are called heads and Princes of
the Apoſtles by the Fathers, as we ſaid before, becauſe they
had eminent gifts. So <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omer</hi> and <hi>Virgilius</hi> are called Princes
of the Poets; <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes, Coriphaei oratorum;</hi>
and <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle, Philoſophorum principes.</hi> So <hi>Nicodemus</hi>
was called Prince of the Jews, by <hi>Cyrillus</hi> and <hi>Polycarpus.</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> Prince of <hi>Aſia</hi> by <hi>Hieronymus.</hi> The
meaning of the Fathers then, giving to <hi>Peter</hi> thoſe titles of
<hi>head,</hi> or <hi>prince,</hi> is not of the firſt ſort of primacy, as was

               <p>IN the former Chapters were anſwered, thoſe teſtimonies
of Fathers alleged by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to prove the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of <hi>Peter</hi> over the Church, <hi>cap.</hi> 19. and over the
other Apoſtles, <hi>cap.</hi> 20. in anſwering which teſtimonies,
we proved, by oppoſing teſtimonies to teſtimonies, that the
meaning of thoſe Fathers was nothing leſſe, then that <hi>Peter</hi>
was Monarch of the Church, which we proved by two ſort
of teſtimonies; firſt, by thoſe in which the ſame things
were ſaid of others beſide <hi>Peter,</hi> by which they endeavoured
to prove his ſupremacy, ſuch as <hi>head of the Church, prince of
the Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. The ſecond ſort was of thoſe, expreſly
denying that <hi>Peter</hi> had any ſuperiority above the other
Apoſtles, of which kind we alledged many. In this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we will vindicate the ſaid teſtimonies from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of our Adverſaries; and becauſe their anſwers to

which are in effect two notable ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt teſtimony is of</hi> Cyprianus, de unitate eccleſiae,
Hoc erant utique &amp; caeteri Apoſtoli, quod <hi>Petrus,</hi> pari conſortio

                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:64826:126"/>
This is a notable paſſage, in which <hi>Cyprianus</hi> is expreſly
diſputing againſt the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter;</hi> for firſt, he affirms,
all the Apoſtles were the ſame, which <hi>Peter</hi> was, and leaſt
any ſhould think that his meaning is only, that they were
all Apoſtles or fellows, he adds, <hi>Pari conſortio,</hi> they were
of alike fellowſhip, ſince it might be objected, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality
might be amongſt thoſe of the ſame fellowſhip; and
our Adverſaries ordinarily diſtinguiſh between <hi>order</hi> and <hi>juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
as if the other Apoſtles were inferiour to <hi>Peter</hi> in
<hi>juriſdiction,</hi> he adds, they were alike fellows <hi>in honour

<hi>Peter.</hi> This place of <hi>Cyprian</hi> puts our Adverſaries to their

               <p>But it is anſwered, albeit it might be defended, that
thoſe words make not much for the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter</hi> in

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64826:127"/>
Apoſtles were all of a like power <hi>before</hi> Peter <hi>was ordained
Monarch of the Church by Chriſt, viz.</hi> before he ſaid to him,
<hi>tu es Petrus,</hi> and this is the meaning of <hi>Cyprian; Bozius</hi> adds,
that this place of <hi>Cyprian</hi> expreſly makes for the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirms in the ſame place,
that the equality of the Apoſtles was taken away by

equality of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſtry, and firſt <hi>Bozius</hi> lyeth notoriouſly;
<hi>Cyprian</hi> affirmeth no ſuch thing, as that the equality of the
Apoſtles ceaſed after thoſe words, <hi>Paſce oves meas,</hi> ſince it
is the mind of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that the equality of the Apoſtles was,
or conſiſted in feeding the flock of Chriſt; for he expreſly
affirms in the ſame place, that the equality of the Apoſtles
was ordained after the reſurrection; for immediatly before
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> words we cited, he affirmeth, <hi>Chriſtus Apoſtolus omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,
poſt reſurrectionem ſuam, parem poteſtatem tribuit:</hi> and
therefore, it is falſe that after thoſe words, <hi>Paſce oves meas,</hi>
the equality of the Apoſtles was taken away. <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
uſeth another diſtinction, <hi>lib. 1. cap. 12. viz.</hi> that all the
Apoſtles had alike authority over the Church; but they
were not of alike authority amongſt themſelves. This is the
anſwer alſo of <hi>Coſterus, encherid, cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, this gloſſe of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> is very ſtrange;
firſt, how can <hi>Peter</hi> be oecumenick Biſhop, if the other
Apoſtles had alike Authority over the Church with him? for,
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> queſtionleſs will not affirm, that any
other Biſhop has as much Authority over the Church, as he
hath. Secondly, though this diſtinction were granted, it takes
not away the force of the teſtimony, for diſparity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
doth not infer a diſparity of Authority alike in them
all, but only that the Authority is more eminent in dignity
in ſome, then in others. Thirdly, whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64826:127"/>
that they were all alike Apoſtles, but the function of an
Apoſtle is the higheſt degree in the Church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> if they
were equal to him in the Apoſtleſhip, they were equal to him
in the higheſt Eccleſiaſtical function. As for that diſtinction
of <hi>Bellarmines, That that equality of the Apoſtles with</hi> Peter
<hi>was extra radinar, and not derived to their ſucceſſors as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of</hi> Peter, <hi>who was ordinar Paſtor, and whoſe Authority
was derived to his Succeſſors;</hi> we proved before, that it was a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> own invention, not known to the Ancients.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanderus, lib. 6. cap.</hi> 4, of his Monarchy, hath another
diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> that albeit all the Apoſtles were of equal
Authority over Chriſtians, yet the Original of that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was from <hi>Peter,</hi> although as to the execution, it was alike
in them all.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered firſt, this diſtinction is preſſed with the
ſame difficulties, with which thoſe of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> was; it is a
flat contradiction, to affirm any to be equal in the execution
of that Authority, with thoſe from whom they have it: yea
<hi>Leo Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> complained heavily, that the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
was made equal to him as to the execution of it. This
diſtinction of <hi>Sanderus</hi> leans on a falſe foundation, <hi>viz. that the
reſt of the Apoſtles had their Authority from</hi> Peter: which expreſly
contradicts <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who affirms, <hi>they had it from</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and</hi>
Paul, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. profeſſeth, <hi>he was an Ambaſſadour from
Chriſt, or in the name of Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Franciſcus de victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
(as we ſhewed before) expreſly diſputs, <hi>that all the
Apoſtles had their Authority immediatly from Chriſt;</hi> and tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the gloſſe on <hi>Cyprian,</hi> making uſe of this dictinction of
<hi>Sanderus,</hi> againſt the mind of <hi>Cyprian:</hi> However, it may be
granted, that <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt in Dignity, although the
other Apoſtles were equal to him in Authority.</p>
               <p>Stapleton, <hi>lib. 6. cap.</hi> 7. in <hi>principis,</hi> uſeth a threefold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
the firſt is, that all the Apoſtles were of alike pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64826:128"/>
as Apoſtles, but not as Biſhops; But that diſtinction was
exploded before, <hi>cap.</hi> 16. The ſecond diſtinction is, <hi>quo
ad amplitudinem, rerum gerundarum, ſed non quo ad ſuperiorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
in ordine gerendi:</hi> that is in effect the ſame diſtinction
with that of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> now mentioned, and therefore it
needs no other anſwer, ſince it imports no other thing, then
that the equality of the Apoſtles power was relative to the
Church, but their inequality conſiſted in their relation to
<hi>Peter.</hi> His third diſtinction is, that <hi>Peter</hi> had power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
above the other Apoſtles: but according
to the execution of that Power, all the Apoſtles were
alike with him: But that diſtinction, is likewayes contradictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as we ſhewed before, and this much of <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond teſtimony, is of</hi> Hieronymus, lib. 1. in Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinianum,
Vt dicis, ſuper Petrum ſundatur eccleſis: licet id ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
alio loco, ſuper omnes Apoſtolos fiat, &amp; ex aequo ſuper eos
eccleſiae fortitudo ſolidetur: but you affirm, that the Church
is founded upon <hi>Peter,</hi> although the ſame be done in another
place upon all the Apoſtles, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Church is builded
upon them all alike; <hi>which gloſſe of</hi> Hieronymus, <hi>quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
that argument of</hi> Peters <hi>Supremacy,</hi> viz. <hi>that he
was the only Rock among all the Apoſtles, upon which the
Church was builded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, that <hi>Hieronymus</hi> explains himſelf in
the ſame place, where he affirms, one was choſen among the
twelve; that a head being conſtitute, occaſion of Schiſm might
be taken away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is replyed, <hi>Cardinal Cauſanus</hi> ſees no ſuch gloſs
in theſe words of <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> as we ſhewed before, <hi>cap.</hi> 10.
where he affirms, that nothing peculiar was promiſed to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
in theſe words <hi>tues Petrus,</hi> and proves it by this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> that the Church was builded alike upon
all the Apoſtles, and in what ſence <hi>Peter</hi> is called head by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64826:128"/>
                  <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> was ſhewed before, <hi>cap.</hi> 20. for it is certain, that
<hi>Hieronymus,</hi> by calling <hi>Peter</hi> head of the twelve, doth not
mean <hi>Peter</hi> had juriſdiction over the reſt; otherwayes he would
expreſly contradict himſelf, in this ſame place; he calls him
<hi>heaa</hi> therefore in the ſame ſenſe, that others are called heads,
which we mentioned, <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inſtances, that <hi>he was made head of the
twelve, that ſchiſme might be takan away.</hi> But it is replyed,
that was before they were ſent by Chriſt to preach the Goſpel:
but <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Hieronymus</hi> ſeems to be of that opinion, that
<hi>Peter</hi> was head of the twelve, as the Apoſtles were a private
Company or Congregation; but after the reſurrection, that
authority ceaſed, when our Saviour commiſſionated them all
alike to preach the Goſpel through the world with equal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>And this much of that famous Diſpute of the ſupremacy of
<hi>Peter,</hi> in which we have fiſhed all what is of any moment from
that immenſe Ocean of Antiquity, either to aſſault it, or aſſert
it; by which it appears, to any indifferent Reader, upon what a
weak foundation the Faith of the Modern Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is
built, <hi>viz. the ſupremacy of</hi> Peter, <hi>or that</hi> Peter <hi>was oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Biſhop:</hi> which was a concert that the Ancients did not
dream of, before the fifth Age after the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
when that contention aroſe between the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for the primacy. Before the time of <hi>Leo</hi> firſt,
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> himſelf pleaded a priority in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
by Acts of Councils, but ſuccumbing in that, <hi>Leo</hi> was the
firſt that deviſed <hi>tues Petrus</hi> for the primacy, his ſucceſſours
ſtill argumenting the force of that Argument, and uſed it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for univerſal juriſdiction; whereas at firſt, it was objected
only for <hi>cura univerſalis eccleſiae.</hi> Now having abſolved that
diſpute of <hi>Peters</hi> Monarchy, we will examine his Biſhoprick of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which is the ſecond part of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Peter.</hi>

Peter <hi>at the command of Chriſt fixed his ſeat at</hi> Rome, <hi>and did

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wed before,
that all the Faith and Doctrine of the modern Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> depended upon the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:64826:129"/>
which ſupremacy conſiſted in three aſſertions; firſt, that
<hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>oecumenick Biſhop</hi> by divine inſtitution, which
makes nothing for the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
without the other two, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> by divine inſtitution
was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceeded
to <hi>Peter</hi> by divine inſtitution in the Monarchy of the Church;
any of thoſe two being brangled, the whole foundation of the
modern Roman Religion is quite deſtroyed. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to
prove both the one and the other (after he had undertaken to
prove them by divine inſtitution) brings nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
involved with contradictions, and conſequently the
whole Edifice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is builded upon ſuch
conjectures. The ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhall
be diſputed in the following Books: in this Chapter are
anſwered thoſe reaſons, proving that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome;</hi> in
the next ſhall be anſwered, thoſe reaſons proving <hi>Peter</hi> was
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and then we will conclude this Book with
thoſe reaſons of <hi>Marcilius Petavinus</hi> and <hi>Ulrichus Velenus,</hi>
proving that <hi>Peter,</hi> was neither at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor Biſhop of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bellarmines <hi>firſt reaſon to prove that</hi> Peter <hi>was at</hi> Rome, <hi>is
from</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 13. The Church which is at Babylon ſalutes
you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was the Church (<hi>ſaith</hi> Bellarmine) in which
<hi>Peter</hi> remained when he wrote this Epiſtle, <hi>viz. Babylon,</hi> which
in the Scripture many times ſignifies <hi>Rome;</hi> and therefore <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
by <hi>Babylon</hi> means <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Peter</hi> was at
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, albeit in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> which is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Propheſie, <hi>Rome</hi> be meant by <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet we do not
find in Scripture in any Epiſtle, that <hi>Rome</hi> was called <hi>Babylon:</hi>
it would be a ridiculous expreſſion to conclude an Epiſtle
written at <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in all his
Epiſtles written at <hi>Rome,</hi> never concludes from <hi>Babylon,</hi> but
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64826:130"/>
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> in this Epiſtle underſtands not
<hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Babylon.</hi> It is to be obſerved, there were two
Cities called <hi>Babylon;</hi> the firſt <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which was
the head of the Babyloniſh Empire; the other <hi>Babylon</hi> was
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and afterwards was called <hi>Cayre: Peter</hi> by <hi>Babylon</hi>
means either the one or the other, more probably the firſt,
becauſe it appears by Hiſtory, that many Jews remained there,
and <hi>Peter</hi> was the Apoſtle of the Jews, as <hi>Paul</hi> was of the
Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Bellarmine <hi>objects, that</hi> Irenaeus, Juſtinus <hi>and</hi> Tertullianus,
expone that <hi>Babylon</hi> mentioned by <hi>Peter</hi> to be <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, thoſe Fathers follow the authority of
<hi>Papias,</hi> believed to be the Diſciple of <hi>John,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
affirms, he was followed by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who in <hi>Euſebius, lib. 3.
cap.</hi> 39. affirms, that the ſaid <hi>Papias</hi> and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> were au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
of the Apoſtle <hi>John;</hi> but <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the ſaid place
confutes that opinion, by the authority of <hi>Papias</hi> himſelf,
who denyed that ever he had ſeen the Apoſtles with his eyes;
<hi>Euſebius</hi> adds, that he was a man of <hi>no ſpirit</hi> and the Author
not only of the <hi>Millinarii,</hi> but alſo of other fabulous tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
and ſo in the opinion of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> the authority of
<hi>Papias</hi> is not much to be regarded. And ſince the whole
foundation of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> depends upon the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſince the ſupremacy of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> depends upon <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome;</hi> and
ſince <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> depends upon the teſtimonies of
ſome Fathers, following the Authority of <hi>Papias;</hi> it may be
concluded without ſophiſtry, that the whole Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> depends upon the ſaid <hi>Papias:</hi> what ſort of
man he was, we have now ſhewed from <hi>Euſebius, lib. 3. cap.</hi> 39.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſecond Argument, to prove that <hi>Peter</hi> was at
<hi>Rome,</hi> is this, <hi>There were Chriſtians at</hi> Rome, <hi>before ever</hi> Paul
<hi>came to</hi> Rome, <hi>Ergo</hi> Peter <hi>was at</hi> Rome: and here he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64826:130"/>
to prove by many teſtimonies, that <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt
that preached the Goſpel at <hi>Rome,</hi> but to no purpoſe, ſince
thoſe teſtimonies are of no more force to prove that <hi>Peter</hi>
was at <hi>Rome,</hi> then thoſe he alledged in the former Argument.
That they are falſe, appears by <hi>Oroſius, lib. 7. cap.</hi> 4. who
affirms, that Chriſtians were at <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
but <hi>Peter</hi> came not to <hi>Rome,</hi> till after the death of <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
that is, the ſecond year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth.</p>
               <p>Bellarmine <hi>anſwers,</hi> That <hi>Oroſius</hi> doth not affirm, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
were at <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> but only that the
Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> made a decree, that they ſhould not come to
<hi>Rome;</hi> which is the true meaning of <hi>Oroſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is replyed, <hi>Oroſius</hi> expreſly affirms, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> made
a motion to the Senat of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
as a God; but the Senat refuſing, ſet forth an Edict,
that Chriſtians ſhould be exterminated or extruded the City
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which imports that Chriſtians were at <hi>Rome;</hi> which
is confirmed by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in his <hi>Chronicles,</hi> an. 38. who ſaith,
<hi>the Senat eliminated Chriſtians from the City;</hi> but <hi>eliminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
is properly to put them out, that were in already. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
both <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the ſaid place, and <hi>Tertullianus, Apol.
cap.</hi> 5. affirm, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> threatned death to the Accuſers
of Chriſtians at <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby it evidently appears that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
were at <hi>Rome.</hi> Likewayes, <hi>Platina</hi> in the life of Chriſt,
affirms expreſly, that the Senate ordained Chriſtians to be put
forth of the City: likewayes, <hi>Clement</hi> in his firſt book of
<hi>Recognitions,</hi> affirms, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> in the time
of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers to this laſt objection, <hi>That thoſe Books
of</hi> Clement <hi>are Apocryphal.</hi> But it is replyed, when they
ſetch teſtimonies from this Book to prove any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> their Tenets,

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64826:131"/>
they are preſſed with teſtimonies from it, they call it Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmines</hi> third reaſon, to prove that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> is,
<hi>That ſeveral of the Fathers affirm, that</hi> Mark <hi>wrote his Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
at</hi> Rome, <hi>as he heard</hi> Peter <hi>preach it there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, that all this depends upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Papias,</hi> neither do they agree amongſt themſelves in
the relation; for, <hi>Hieronymus</hi> following the authority of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias,</hi>
whom <hi>Euſebius</hi> called <hi>an Impoſtor</hi> (as we ſaid before)
affirms, that <hi>Mark</hi> wrote the ſaid Evangel when <hi>Peter</hi> was
alive, and that the ſaid <hi>Mark</hi> died the eigth year of <hi>Nero:</hi> but
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirms, <hi>lib. 3. cap.</hi> 1. that <hi>Mark</hi> wrote his Evangel,
after the death of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmines</hi> fourth reaſon, to prove that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi>
is, <hi>that his Sepulchre is at</hi> Rome, which he proves by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of many Fathers. But it is anſwered, they were all
deceived by <hi>Papias;</hi> Secondly, thoſe Fathers who affirm, that
<hi>Peter</hi> dyed at <hi>Rome,</hi> relate ſome circumſtances of his death,
which ſeem incredible; as firſt, they affirm, <hi>that</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi>
Paul <hi>died in one day;</hi> but that ſeems incredible, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi>
came to <hi>Rome</hi> about the third and fourth year of <hi>Nero,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
that he was then old: They likewayes affirm, that he
died the fourteenth year of <hi>Nero,</hi> and ſo he lived ten years
after he called himſelf old: But this ſeems not to conſiſt with
that aſſertion, of his dying in one day with <hi>Peter;</hi> for, it is
ſcarce credible, that <hi>Peter</hi> could be alive ten years after <hi>Paul</hi>
called himſelf an old man, ſince <hi>Paul</hi> was very young when he
was converted; but it appears by <hi>John</hi> 21. 18. that <hi>Peter</hi>
was an old man before <hi>Paul</hi> was converted, that is, when Chriſt
was alive; but <hi>Paul</hi> was not converted untill a year after the
death of Chriſt, and therefore it ſeems incredible, that <hi>Peter</hi>
could live ten years after <hi>Paul</hi> called himſelf an old man. The
ſecond incredible circumſtance is, that they affirm, <hi>that</hi> Peter <hi>a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64826:131"/>
little before his death, having an intention to leave</hi> Rome,
<hi>Chriſt appeared to him in the Port of the City, and deſired him
to return:</hi> but the Scripture affirms, <hi>that the Heavens ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Chriſt untill the laſt day;</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf affirms, <hi>that
Chriſt ſhall not deſcend from Heaven till then.</hi> And whereas
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> objects, that Chriſt appeared to <hi>Paul</hi> in the air, he
ſpeaks ſo without any ground, becauſe <hi>Act.</hi> 9. it is only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<hi>that a great light ſhined round about Paul, and that he
heard a voice;</hi> but the Scripture there doth not affirm, <hi>that
Chriſt was in the air; Paul</hi> might have ſeen Chriſt as <hi>Stephen</hi>
did, in heaven, himſelf being upon earth, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 55. And
thoſe are the reaſons by which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proves <hi>Peter</hi> was at
<hi>Rome,</hi> which all are founded upon conjectures. And ſince the
ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is founded upon the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of <hi>Peter,</hi> and that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſince <hi>Peters</hi>
being at <hi>Rome</hi> is founded upon contradictory conjectures (as
partly we have ſhewed, and partly ſhall ſhew hereafter, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuting
the reaſons of <hi>Velenus</hi>) by conſequence, the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is founded upon contradictory
conjectures.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. Bellarmines reaſons proving, that Peter was Biſhop of
Rome, anſwered.</head>
               <p>IN the next place, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> endeavours to prove, that
<hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore he behoved to
be at <hi>Rome:</hi> and his firſt reaſon is, <hi>That the Church of</hi>
Rome <hi>was ever held the firſt Church, but there can be no other
reaſon why it was held ſo, but only that</hi> Peter was <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, firſt, that <hi>Rome</hi> was held the firſt
Church of old, not in power, but in dignity, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi>
was the chief imperial City, as appears expreſly by the third
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64826:132"/>
Canon of the ſecond general Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
the 28. Canon of the fourth general Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi>
the 36. Canon of the ſixth general Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
of which hereafter, <hi>part. 2 lib</hi> 1. and 2. Secondly, if reſpect be had
to other reaſons, beſides the imperial dignity of the City,
it is falſe that <hi>Rome</hi> was held for the firſt Church, as appears
by many teſtimonies, firſt, <hi>Theodoretus, lib. 5. cap.</hi> 9. affirms,
that the ſecond general Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in an
Epiſtle to <hi>Damaſus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Biſhops of the
Weſt, calls the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem, Mother of all Churches.</hi>
Secondly, <hi>Nazianzenus, epiſt.</hi> 18. affirms, <hi>that the Church
of</hi> Caeſaria <hi>was from the beginning: and was eſteemed almoſt
the Mother of all Churches.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Baſilius, Epiſt.</hi> 20, to
<hi>Athanaſius,</hi> affirms, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Antioch <hi>was head
of all Churches.</hi> The ſame is affirmed by <hi>Chryſoſtomus</hi> in
ſeveral places, as in his Homile of the praiſes of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
and in his third Homile to the people of <hi>Antioch:</hi> by which
teſtimonies it is evident, that <hi>Rome</hi> was called <hi>the firſt Church</hi>
for a civil reſpect only, and that in other reſpects, other
Churches were preferred to it.</p>
               <p>Bellarmines <hi>ſecond Argument is this,</hi> The Hereticks cannot
ſhew (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) where <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop after he left <hi>Antioch,</hi>
if he was not Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince they affirm he was Biſhop
only of a particular Church, and not of the univerſal Church.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> may well confirm his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
by ſuch reaſoning, but he will never convert Hereticks
by it: It is falſe which he affirms, that the Proteſtants
maintain that <hi>Peter</hi> behoved of neceſſity to be Biſhop of one
particular Church or other; they deny he was Biſhop of any
particular Church at all, as ſhall immediatly appear; and
therefore, it is ridiculous in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to conclude, that
<hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe they cannot inſtruct where
he was Biſhop elſewhere, when he left <hi>Antioch:</hi> they ask
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64826:132"/>
him again, how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proves that he was Biſhop of
<hi>Antioch?</hi> they ask him alſo, where he was Biſhop before he was
Biſhop of <hi>Antioch?</hi> for <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Argument preſuppones,
that <hi>Peter</hi> of neceſſity, was ſtill Biſhop of one place or other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmines</hi> third reaſon, to prove that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> is taken from the teſtimony of Fathers, affirming,
<hi>he was Biſhop there twenty five years:</hi> As for thoſe 25. years, they
ſhall be proved falſe in the following Chapter: In this we
will anſwer and explain the teſtimonies of thoſe Fathers,
affirming <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> becauſe in effect they
are the only <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Popes ſupremacy, we will examine
them more diligently, and make it appear, that they are ſo
many teſtimonies, proving <hi>Peter</hi> was never Biſhop of the
particular Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is anſwered, to thoſe teſtimonies of <hi>Euſebius, Optatus, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſius,
Hieronymus, Sulpitius, I ſidorus, Irenaeus, Epiphanius,</hi> &amp;c.
affirming <hi>Peter</hi> to be Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> is
taken two wayes; firſt, for a function of governing the
Church in general, ſo <hi>Peter</hi> calles Chriſt <hi>The Biſhop of our
ſouls, epiſt. 1. cap.</hi> 2. ſo an Apoſtleſhip is called <hi>Biſhoprick, Act.</hi> 2.
Secondly, <hi>Biſhop</hi> is taken in a ſtricter ſenſe, for a certain
function Eccleſiaſtick, inferiour unto the Apoſtolick function;
ſo it is taken by <hi>Paul, 1 Tim. cap. 3. If any deſire a Biſhoprick:</hi>
in which laſt ſenſe we now take it, and ſo anſwers thoſe
teſtimonies of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> by which he proves that <hi>Peter</hi>
was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that thoſe Fathers take <hi>Biſhop in the firſt
ſenſe,</hi> and their meaning is no other then that <hi>Peter</hi> as an
Apoſtle, taught at <hi>Rome</hi> twenty five years. That this
is no ſhift or evaſion, is demonſtrated by theſe three following
reaſons.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is, that the Fathers reckoning the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> put <hi>Paul</hi> with <hi>Peter</hi> in the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64826:133"/>
firſt place, whereby it is evident, that thoſe Fathers take
the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the firſt ſenſe, comprehending the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
ſince none of them, nor <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, will
affirm, that <hi>Paul</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecond ſenſe. That
this is the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> is named <hi>firſt Biſhop of Rome</hi>
with <hi>Peter,</hi> appears by thoſe following teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>

by it is evident by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> was not Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſince he gives ranks to the other Biſhops, as if <hi>Linus</hi>
had been firſt Biſhop.</p>
               <p>The third teſtimony is of <hi>Gregorius, lib. 1. cap.</hi> 27.
who reckons the order of ſucceſſion of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
<hi>Linus</hi> were firſt Biſhop, and not <hi>Peter;</hi> for he calls <hi>Clement</hi>
the third Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> but if he had included <hi>Peter</hi> in the
Catalogue of the Biſhops, <hi>Clement</hi> had been the fourth Biſhop
in his Calculation.</p>
               <p>Some Romaniſts anſwer, that thoſe teſtimonies do not
prove <hi>Linus</hi> was firſt Biſhop, <hi>Cletus</hi> ſecond, <hi>Clemens</hi> third,
abſolutely, but only that the meaning of thoſe Fathers is,
that <hi>Linus</hi> was the firſt Biſhop after <hi>Peter, Cletus</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<hi>Clemens</hi> the third; which is as much as if thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had ſaid, <hi>Peter</hi> was firſt, <hi>Linus</hi> ſecond, <hi>Cletus</hi> third,
<hi>Clemens</hi> fourth.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, that is but a ſhift or evaſion, becauſe
it appears to any who is verſed in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that when he
ſpeaks ſo, <hi>Firſt Biſhop</hi> after ſuch an one, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that <hi>one</hi> in his
opinion be a Biſhop himſelf, he includes him in the number,
and makes him firſt Biſhop, as appears by his Catalogue of
the Biſhops of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he calls <hi>Cerdo</hi> the third
Biſhop after <hi>Anianus,</hi> but he calls <hi>Anianus firſt Biſhop, lib.
12. cap.</hi> 3. So, <hi>cap.</hi> 16. he reckons <hi>Anianus</hi> firſt, <hi>Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
ſecond, <hi>Cerdo</hi> third; whereby it is evident, that when
he ſpeaks ſo, <hi>viz. third Biſhop after ſuch an one,</hi> That he
evermore includes that <hi>one</hi> in the number, when he thinks he
is a Biſhop, as is evident by his reckoning of the Biſhops of
<hi>Alexandria, Cerdo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was third after</hi> Anianus; That
is, <hi>Anianus</hi> was firſt, <hi>Abilius</hi> ſecond, <hi>Cerdo</hi> third: But in
the Catalogue of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he calls <hi>Linus</hi>
the firſt after <hi>Peter, Cletus</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Clemens</hi> the third,
he includes not <hi>Peter</hi> in the Catalogue, but reckons them as
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64826:134"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> were not Biſhop at all, other wayes he would call <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as he did <hi>Anianus</hi> firſt Biſhop of
<hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third reaſon proving thoſe Fathers calling <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> takes the word Biſhop largely, and not ſtrictly, and
properly is unanſwerable, becauſe it appears by their own
teſtimonies, and likewayes of other Fathers, that <hi>Linus</hi> and
<hi>Cletus,</hi> were Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> was alive; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is evident, that <hi>Peter</hi> was called Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> only
becauſe he and <hi>Paul</hi> founded that Church (in the opinion of
thoſe Fathers) for <hi>Peter</hi> could not be Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
if <hi>Linus</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> was
alive: but that <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus</hi> were Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi>
when <hi>Paul</hi> was alive, is proved by theſe following teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
               <p>The firſt teſtimony is of <hi>Tertullianus, lib. de praeſcrip.
cap.</hi> 32. (according to the diſtinction of <hi>Pamelius</hi>) where
he affirms, that <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was ordained Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> by
<hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, and in the ſame manner, <hi>Clemens</hi> was
ordained Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Peter:</hi> but it is notorious, that
<hi>John</hi> was alive when he ordained <hi>Polycarpus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
neither was <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> himſelf; therefore it
follows, that <hi>Clemens</hi> being ordained Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> by
<hi>Peter,</hi> that he was Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> was alive,
ſince <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> when <hi>John</hi> was
alive.</p>
               <p>The ſecond teſtimony is of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and is this, in <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,
lib. 5 hiſt. cap.</hi> 6. where <hi>Euſebius</hi> brings in <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
ſpeaking thus, <hi>The bleſſed Apoſtles</hi> [Paul <hi>and</hi> Peter] <hi>found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>gave unto</hi> Linus <hi>the Biſhoprick of the
Adminiſtration of the Church:</hi> whereby it is notorious, that
the function of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> was different from the function
of Biſhop (in the ſtrict and proper ſenſe) and likewayes, it
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64826:135"/>
is evident by the word, that while they were alive, they
did put <hi>Linus</hi> in the actual poſſeſſion of the Biſhoprick of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, that <hi>Peter</hi> did put <hi>Linus</hi> and
<hi>Cletus in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>when he was alive, not as
Biſhops, but as Coadjutors unto him, eſpecially</hi> Peter <hi>being
oftimes called elſewhere by his Apoſtolick ſunction:</hi> But he
intangles himſelf foully; firſt, he makes <hi>Peter</hi> ſufficient to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the whole Church, as elſewhere he affirmeth, and yet
in this anſwer, he makes him inſufficient to govern the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> without a Coadjutor. 2. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirms, that <hi>Paul</hi>
ordained <hi>Linus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as <hi>Peter;</hi> and if <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
had been Coadjutor to thoſe who ordained him, he would
have been Coadjutor to <hi>Paul</hi> as well as to <hi>Peter,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<hi>Paul</hi> was alſo Biſhop of <hi>Rome. 3. Irenaeus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
diſtinguiſheth the Office of an Apoſtle from that of a
Biſhop, in theſe words, for he affirmeth, Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul
<hi>founded the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and gave the Biſhoprick
thereof to</hi> Linus: So <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> heraeſie 27. affirms, <hi>that
the Office of an Apoſtle was not tyed to one place, and
therefore in their abſence,</hi> Rome <hi>could not be without a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Teſtimony is of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> in his preface to thoſe
Books of <hi>Recognitions</hi> attributed to <hi>Clement;</hi> his words
are theſe, Linus <hi>and</hi> Cletus <hi>were Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>before</hi>
Clement, <hi>but while</hi> Peter <hi>was alive, to wit, that they might
be Biſhops, and himſelf might fulfill the office of an Apoſtle:</hi> in
which words, <hi>Ruffinus</hi> expreſly calls <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus</hi> Biſhops
of <hi>Rome,</hi> having a diſtinct Office from that of <hi>Peter;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it evidently appears, that <hi>Peter</hi> was not Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in
the ſtrict ſenſe mentioned before; which is further confirmed
by the next following words of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> wherein he affirms,
<hi>that</hi> Zacheus <hi>was in the ſame manner ordained by</hi> Peter <hi>Biſhop
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64826:135"/>
at</hi> Caeſaria, <hi>as</hi> Linus <hi>and</hi> Cletus <hi>were at</hi> Rome. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
will not affirm, that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Caeſaria,</hi> and <hi>Zachaeus</hi>
his Coadjutor; and although this teſtimony of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> doth
not convince <hi>Barronius,</hi> yet <hi>Onufrius, Sanderus, Feuardentius,</hi>
confeſſe ingenuouſly, that it can hardly be ſhunned. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontus</hi>
gives no regard to the teſtimony of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> becauſe
he interprets that ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Neice</hi> againſt
the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> but ſince <hi>Ruffinus</hi>
lived very near that time, and ſince he is ſeconded by all the
ancient Interpreters: as ſhall appear in the following Book,
who all interpret that Act againſt the ſupremacy of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as he, though in a different manner)

Firſt, thoſe Fathers affirming <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> agree all
that he was twenty five years Biſhop there; and yet, ſome
of them affirms, that he came to <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecond year of

many of thoſe foreſaid Authors affirm, that <hi>Peter</hi> did ſit 25

certainty of Chriſts death is had from Scripture, and not
from thoſe who vary about the time of it; but the certainty
of <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome</hi> is had no where, but from thoſe who
vary about the time of his coming there; and ſince they
contradict other in the laſt, they merit no credit in the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, ſecondly, <hi>that no approved Authors
varies in the time, but only ſome baſtard Authors ſuch, as</hi> Faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus

The ſecond perſwaſion that <hi>Peter</hi> was never at <hi>Rome</hi> is this,
they who affirm, <hi>Peter</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecond
year of <hi>Claudius;</hi> ſo <hi>Hieronymus, Euſebius</hi> and others
affirm, it was to defeat <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who died in the laſt
year of <hi>Nero,</hi> that is, twenty five years after the ſecond year
of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and for whoſe death, <hi>Peter</hi> alſo himſelf was
put to death by <hi>Nero:</hi> but ſince <hi>Peter</hi> went a purpoſe to <hi>Rome</hi>
to deſtroy <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> it is a thing incredible, that he
could not do it in leſſe then twenty five years; yea, <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
himſelf affirms; that <hi>Peter</hi> after he had ſtayed ſeven years at
<hi>Rome</hi> came back to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> but this is more incredible,
that <hi>Peter</hi> would go to <hi>Rome</hi> to overcome <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
ſtay there ſeven years, and come back without doing any
thing, and ſuffer <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to live eighteen years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon why <hi>Peter</hi> was not at <hi>Rome,</hi> is this, they
who ſo affirm, maintain alſo, that <hi>Peter</hi> went to <hi>Antioch</hi>
five years after the paſſion of Chriſt, was ſeven years Biſhop
there, and then went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was Biſhop twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
five years: but it appears by <hi>Galat.</hi> 1. and 2. <hi>Acts</hi>
12. and 15. that <hi>Peter</hi> for the moſt part was at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
at leaſt to the eighteenth year after Chriſts paſſion;
but according to the Calculation of thoſe Authors, <hi>Peter</hi>
had been ſeven years at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the eighteenth year of
Chriſts paſſion, and conſequently, he could not be at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and at the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the eighteenth
year after Chriſts paſſion.</p>
               <p>Bellarmine <hi>anſwers,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſeventh year of his
Biſhoprick was expelled <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe <hi>Acts</hi> 18. it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
that <hi>Claudius</hi> expelled the Jews from <hi>Rome,</hi> and came
back to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that year of the Council, from whence he
returned back to <hi>Rome</hi> and died there.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, he involves himſelf in a world of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities;

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64826:137"/>
                  <hi>Claudius,</hi> when he made that Edict againſt the Jews; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
if <hi>Peter</hi> had been expelled by that Edict, it behoved
of neceſſity to be ſome conſiderable time before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

was preſent at the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
(as is affirmed by <hi>Luke</hi>) after that Council, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

that, having gone thorow <hi>Phrygia, Galatia, Mycia,</hi> he

to <hi>Berea,</hi> from thence to <hi>Athens,</hi> Acts 15. 16. and 17.
After all thoſe journeys, he arived at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he
did find <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> who were now come out of
<hi>Italy,</hi> by reaſon of that Edict of <hi>Claudius;</hi> whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirms falſly, that <hi>Peter</hi> was expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Rome</hi> by reaſon of that Edict of <hi>Claudius,</hi> ſince when
<hi>Paul</hi> found <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> it behoved to
be ſome years after <hi>Peter</hi> was expelled <hi>Rome,</hi> conſidering <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
journey from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before the Council,
<hi>Pauls</hi> tedious journeys after the Council, before he met
with <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> who were new come out of
<hi>Rome</hi> by reaſon of that Edict of <hi>Claudius</hi> (or as the Syrian
Interpreter) were expelled <hi>Rome</hi> at the ſame time, by
that Edict of <hi>Claudius:</hi> So it is impoſſible, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſo
long time before could have been expelled by the ſame Edict.</p>

de pont.</hi> Rom., <hi>that</hi> Peter <hi>had left a dangerous example to
poſterity, if he had retained two Biſhopricks at one time.</hi> But
its no leſs pernitious example to leave their particular Charge,
as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirms, <hi>Peter</hi> did; neither is it of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to affirm, that he was forced to leave it by that Edict
of <hi>Claudius,</hi> ſince <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould rather have ſuffered, then
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64826:137"/>
obeyed that Edict: Secondly, becauſe as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirms,
when he was Biſhop of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> he wandered up and
down, leaving his Charge. Thirdly, it ſeems very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirms, <hi>that</hi> Peter <hi>in one year was
Biſhop of</hi> Antioch, <hi>impriſoned at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and Biſhop of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if <hi>Peter</hi> had been Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time
of the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he would not at that very Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
made that paction with <hi>Paul;</hi> taking upon himſelf to
be Apoſtle of the Jewes, and leaving it to <hi>Paul</hi> to be Apoſtle
of the Gentiles, among which his own Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it is not credible, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have been
fourteen years (at the time of the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>)
partly Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> partly of <hi>Rome,</hi> 2 Church for
the moſt part of Gentiles, and yet to compell the ſaid Gentiles
to judaize as <hi>Peter</hi> did.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon that <hi>Peter</hi> was never at <hi>Rome,</hi> is this,
that <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Romans, ſalutes many, <hi>cap.</hi>
16. but he makes no mention of <hi>Peter</hi> at all; but it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
he would have ſaluted ſo many, and ommit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſalutation of <hi>Peter,</hi> who was Biſhop of the place.</p>
               <p>Bellarmine <hi>anſwers,</hi> That he did not ſalute <hi>John</hi> in his
Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> nor <hi>James</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews;</hi>
and yet <hi>John</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is replyed, this anſwer of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh,
for to omit that neither <hi>John</hi> nor <hi>James</hi> were Biſhops
at all, but only Apoſtles and founders of thoſe Churches, as
we ſaid before, <hi>John</hi> was not at <hi>Epheſus</hi> at that time, nor
ſtayed there, and <hi>James</hi> at that time was dead; neither did
<hi>Paul</hi> write his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to the particular Church
of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but to the whole Jews.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, ſecondly, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>was not return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to</hi> Rome, <hi>when</hi> Paul <hi>wrote his Epiſtle to the Romans.</hi> But
it is replyed, firſt, <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> were returned to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:64826:138"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirms were expelled at the ſame
time with <hi>Peter,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſalutes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 3. but it
is incredible, that <hi>Peter</hi> who was Biſhop of the place, would
not have returned with the firſt. Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> among the
cauſes of his thankſgiving for the Faith of the Romans, <hi>cap.</hi>
1. 8. and other praiſes; <hi>cap.</hi> 16. or of his own prayers, <hi>cap.</hi>
16. 10. makes no mention of <hi>Peter</hi> at all; yet conſtantly in
his Epiſtles, he uſeth to mention the Miniſters of the Churches
to which they are directed, whether they be preſent or not, as
appears by 1. <hi>Corinth. cap. 16. 15. Epheſ. 6. 21. Phil. 2. 19.
Col. 4. 9. 12. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth reaſon that <hi>Peter</hi> was never at <hi>Rome</hi> is, it is known
that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote ſeveral Epiſtles from <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>
in whoſe time <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirms, that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome;</hi>
in which Epiſtles, he makes frequent mention of others of leſſer
note; and yet he makes no mention of <hi>Peter</hi> at all, as <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 11.
and 2. <hi>Timothy,</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p>Bellarmine <hi>anſwers, firſt,</hi> that a negative teſtimony proves
nothing; it doth not follow <hi>Peter</hi> was not at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe
<hi>Paul</hi> makes no mention of him.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, it is not only a negative teſtimony, which
is the ground of the Argument; but an Argument <hi>à minore ad
majus; Paul</hi> makes mention of others of leſſer note: much more
he would have made mention of <hi>Peter,</hi> if he had been at <hi>Rome.</hi>
2. There are two ſorts of negative teſtimonies, the firſt, is,
purely <hi>negative;</hi> the ſecond is <hi>privative,</hi> when nothing is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
when it ſhould have been teſtified: this laſt ſort of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Argument is moſt efficacious; as is acknowledged by
<hi>Medina</hi> upon <hi>Thomas, part. 83. quaeſt. 1. art.</hi> 3. Neither can
it be denyed that this is good reaſoning, There was but one
World created, That only the ſecond perſon of the Trinity
aſſumed fleſh, becauſe the Scripture makes no mention, that
more Worlds were created, or that the other perſons of the
Trinity were incarnate. But this Argument is taken from a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64826:138"/>
privative teſtimony, <hi>viz. Paul</hi> could not, without juſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
make no mention of <hi>Peter,</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> had been at <hi>Rome</hi>
at that time, as appears by <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4. 10, 11. where <hi>Paul</hi>
affirms, that <hi>Marcus, Juſtus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> were all the Jews
which were his work-fellows in the Goſpel: But if <hi>Peter</hi> had
been at <hi>Rome, Paul</hi> had ſpoken untruly in excluding him from
being one of his work-fellows, which he reſtricts to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
three: for, if <hi>Peter</hi> had been at <hi>Rome, Paul</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have affirmed, that thoſe three were the only work-fellows
he had at <hi>Rome.</hi> Again, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10, 11. he affirms, that
all his fellows had forſaken him, except <hi>Luke,</hi> who only was
with him: but if <hi>Peter</hi> had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> he would never have
forſaken <hi>Paul,</hi> nor had it been true which <hi>Paul</hi> affirmed, that
none were with him but <hi>Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe paſſages puzleth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> very ſore, as appears by
his perplexed anſwer he gives to that paſſage of <hi>Coloſ. 4. that</hi>
Paul <hi>ſpeaks only of his domeſticks,</hi> which is a moſt miſerable
<hi>effugium:</hi> for to omit that <hi>Paul</hi> keeped not ſuch a port, as to
have ſo many domeſticks, he expreſly calls thoſe three perſons,
<hi>Ariſtarchus, Marcus, Juſtus,</hi> all the fellow-labourers in the
Goſpel he had at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers to 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. That <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpeaks there of thoſe who might have been interceſſors for
him to <hi>Nero;</hi> which is a very ſimple evaſion, he hath no
ground at all for it; and it is clear againſt the meaning of
<hi>Paul</hi> who ſpeaks of thoſe who ſhould have corroborated
him, or confirmed him, as appears from verſe 17. where
he affirms, that God was with him and ſtrengthened him
only, except <hi>Luke,</hi> verſe 11. But if <hi>Peter</hi> had been
at <hi>Rome,</hi> he would not have neglected ſuch a duty to
<hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, That perhaps <hi>Peter</hi> was
elſewhere when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote thoſe Epiſtles from <hi>Rome;</hi> which
is as much to ſay, that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64826:139"/>
was never at <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Scripture makes mention of
the Teachers of that Church, that <hi>Paul</hi> could never find him
at <hi>Rome,</hi> albeit <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> praiſed by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> affirms,
<hi>cap.</hi> 3. that he was at <hi>Rome</hi> the ſame time with <hi>Paul,</hi> and
died with him in one day. And this much of thoſe reaſons,
proving that <hi>Peter</hi> was never at <hi>Rome;</hi> although they be
not demonſtrative, yet they are very perſwaſive. <hi>Velenus</hi>
in a Treatiſe purpoſly writen of that ſubject, adds many
more, but theſe are ſufficient in this Compend.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we will alledge ſome unanſwerable
reaſons, proving that although <hi>Peter</hi> had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet
he was never Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The firſt is this, the Office
of an Apoſtle and a Biſhop (in the ſtrict ſenſe) are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
in one perſon; a Biſhop is reſtricted to a certain Charge,
but an Apoſtle by inſtitution is bound to have no certain
Charge, as appears by thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Go unto the whole
World,</hi> by which words they are expreſly commanded not
to tye themſelves to any particular place, or at leaſt, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them not to tye themſelves to a particular place: but if
they had been Biſhops, they were of neceſſity tyed to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Charge. If any of the Apoſtles had been Biſhops,
<hi>Paul</hi> had as much reaſon to be called ſo, as any other of the
Apoſtles; but we never read, that <hi>Paul</hi> was Biſhop of any
particular Church, except only <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and ſome others affirm,
that he and <hi>Peter</hi> were conjunct Biſhops of <hi>Rome:</hi> but that quite
deſtroyes <hi>Peters</hi> Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> as we ſaid before, ſince
the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> is taken in a large ſenſe, as they muſt of
neceſſity confeſſe, ſince <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not affirm, that <hi>Paul</hi>
was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in a proper ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is this, they confeſſe that <hi>Peter</hi> was very
oft abſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> and very long; <hi>Carteſius</hi> affirms, that
he was 18. years abſent; <hi>Onuphrius 7, Bellarmine</hi> 5, but if he
had been Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he woul not have been ſo long
from his Charge. They affirm indeed, that he was hindered;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64826:139"/>
but to omit that he was not hindered ſo long, how comes it,
that in his abſence he wrote no Epiſtles to his Charge at <hi>Rome,</hi>
ſince he wrote to the Jews? And whereas they affirm, that
he was at <hi>Rome</hi> when he wrote to the Jews, it is frivolous,
firſt, becauſe we ſhewed before, that his being at <hi>Rome</hi> at that
time, depended upon the authority of <hi>Papias,</hi> the author of
many fabulous traditions, as was proved by the teſtimony of
<hi>Euſebius.</hi> Secondly, albeit he had been at <hi>Rome</hi> when he
wrote thoſe Epiſtles to the Jews, he had much more reaſon
to write to the Romans his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>harge, in ſo long an abſence;
and ſince he did not, it is evident he was never Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third reaſon is, they give <hi>Peter</hi> three Biſhopricks all
at one time (at leaſt, ſome of them, who affirm <hi>Peter</hi> was
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>) They all grant, that <hi>Peter</hi> was firſt Biſhop
of <hi>Antioch,</hi> before he was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> except only
<hi>Onuphrius,</hi> who affirms, that he was firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and next of <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſo he had two Biſhopricks. <hi>Nicephorus,
lib. 14. cap.</hi> 39. affirms, that <hi>Anterius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> wrote,
that <hi>Peter</hi> transferred his ſeat from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Alexandria:</hi> by
which contradictions, it appears they have no ground at all
that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> if it had been true, what
needed them have their recourſe to ſuch contradictions?</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon is, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirms, <hi>lib. de pont. Rom.</hi>
that all the right of the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to
<hi>Peter</hi> is founded upon the command of Chriſt, by which <hi>Peter</hi>
went to <hi>Rome</hi> and fixed his ſeat there. But all thoſe almoſt
who teſtifie <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> affirm, that the occaſion of his
going thither was to defeat <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> neither do they
mention any command of Chriſt at all, as the cauſe of <hi>Peters</hi>
going thither.</p>
               <p>The fifth reaſon is, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> made a paction, that
<hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be Apoſtle of the Jews, <hi>Paul</hi> of the Gentiles;
but if <hi>Peter</hi> had been Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that paction had been
violated. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, <hi>Peters</hi> principal charge was
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64826:140"/>
the Jews, and <hi>Pauls</hi> the Gentiles: But it is replyed, if <hi>Peter</hi>
had been Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> his chief Charge had been the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
or elſe he fixed his Chair where his chief Charge was
not; both which are alike abſurd.</p>
               <p>The ſixth reaſon is, that <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus</hi> were Biſhops of
<hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> was alive; whereby it is demonſtrated, that
<hi>Peter</hi> was not Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> That thoſe were Biſhops when
<hi>Peter</hi> was alive, was proved in the former Chapter, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the evaſion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to this objection in the ſame
place was refuted.</p>
               <p>Finally, as we ſhewed in the former Chapter, they who affirm
<hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> affirm alſo <hi>Paul</hi> was conjunct with
him: whereby it evidently appears, that they take the word
<hi>Biſhop</hi> in a large ſenſe, ſince they make <hi>Paul</hi> his conjunct, and
doth not reckon him in the Catalogue of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as we ſhewed in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>Aud thus we have compendiouſly examined thoſe two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
queſtions, firſt, <hi>Whether</hi> Peter, <hi>by divine inſtitution,
was Monarch of the Church?</hi> Second. <hi>Whether by the command
of Chriſt, he was Biſhop of</hi> Rome. It was proved in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
that the whole Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was
founded upon the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> that the
ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> conſiſted in this, that he
ſucceeded to <hi>Peter,</hi> by divine inſtitution, in the Monarchy of
the Church: which ſucceſſion again, depended upon two aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions,
firſt, That <hi>Peter</hi> was Monarch of the Church, by divine
inſtitution; 2. That he was Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> any of which
being proven falſe, the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is a
cheat, and conſequently alſo, the Doctrine of the Modern
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> depending upon it, as Moon-ſhine upon the
Sun, as is profeſſed by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the Preface of his Books,
<hi>de pont. Rom.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Book, were diſputed the firſt two
Queſtions, of the Supremacy of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether</hi> Peter <hi>was, by divine right,
Monarch of the Church? 2. Whether he was by
divine Inſtitution, Biſhop of</hi> Rome? Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the third Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>by
divine right, ſucceeded to</hi> Peter <hi>in the Monarchy of the Church?
Bellarmine</hi> and others brag, with great confidence to prove that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64826:141"/>
he did, but their performance is very little: not ſo much as
one of them, when it comes to the puſh, brings any paſſage of
Scripture to prove it, except only <hi>Bozius, lib. 18. cap.</hi> 3.
where he makes uſe of two places, the firſt is <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 3. the
words are, <hi>And I beſeech thee, faithful yoke-fellow, help thoſe
women which laboured with me in the Goſpel, with</hi> Clement <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and with other my fellow-labourers, whoſe names are in the
book of life.</hi> Any reaſonable man would admire, by what
Chymiſtry he can diſtill the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
to <hi>Peter,</hi> out of theſe words? He will tell you, <hi>Clement there
mentioned was Biſhop of</hi> Rome: <hi>Secondly, That the care of
thoſe women of</hi> Philippi <hi>belonged to him,</hi> Ergo, <hi>he was oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick
Biſhop; otherwayes, how could he have any medling at</hi>
Philippi, <hi>which was ſo far diſtant from</hi> Rome?</p>
               <p>Let us examine this Logick, it will recreat the Reader:
Firſt, how knows he that <hi>Clement</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> He
will tell you, <hi>that there was one</hi> Clement <hi>that ſucceeded to</hi>
Peter <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>But we ask him, though that were granted, what then? how
knoweth he that it is the ſame <hi>Clement</hi> whom the Apoſtle
mentions here? He will tell you, <hi>this</hi> Clement <hi>mentioned by
the Apoſtle, is called by</hi> Paul <hi>his fellow-labourer;</hi> Ergo, <hi>he
was a Biſhop, and conſequently deſigned at leaſt Biſhop of</hi>
Rome.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, firſt, It doth not follow that <hi>Clement</hi> was
a Biſhop, becauſe he is called by <hi>Paul</hi> his fellow-labourer; for
that ſame Argument would conclude <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> a
man and his wife, to be both Biſhop. <hi>Rom. 16. Paul</hi> calls
them his fellow-labourers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Salmero</hi> the Jeſuite, preſſed by the <hi>Madeburgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
that <hi>Clement</hi> was not oecumenick Biſhop, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> calls
him fellow-labourer, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 3. anſwers, <hi>That at that time</hi>
Clement <hi>was not deſigned Biſhop of</hi> Rome; <hi>and therefore it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64826:141"/>
doth not follow:</hi> where obſerve how he contradicts <hi>Bozius;
Bozius</hi> concludes he was oecumenick Biſhop deſigned, becauſe
<hi>Paul</hi> calls him fellow-labourer; <hi>Salmero</hi> grants, that it follows
he was not deſigned oecumenick Biſhop, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> calls
him fellow-labourer: <hi>Bozius</hi> reaſons, he is called fellow-labourer,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> he was deſigned oecumenick Biſhop; <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero</hi>
reaſons, <hi>Paul</hi> calls him his fellow-labourer, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was
not deſigned oecumenick Biſhop at that time; having no
other ſhift to elude the Argument of the <hi>Madeburgenſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, although it were granted, that <hi>Paul</hi> meant <hi>Clement</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> how proves he that <hi>Clement</hi> ſucceeded to
<hi>Peter</hi> in the Monarchy of the Church? which is the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>He anſwers you, <hi>becauſe</hi> Paul <hi>deſires his yoke-fellow to aſsiſt
him in the care of thoſe women at</hi> Philippi: <hi>for what ado had</hi>
Clement <hi>with women in</hi> Philippi, <hi>he being deſigned Biſhop of</hi>
Rome, <hi>except the care of the Church of</hi> Philippi <hi>had belonged
unto him, and conſequently he was oecumenick Biſhop?</hi> But to
omit the bad conſequence of that Argument, he miſtakes the
words of <hi>Paul</hi> or their conſtruction; <hi>Paul</hi> doth not deſire his
yoke-fellow to aſſiſt <hi>Clement</hi> in having a care of thoſe women;
he only deſires him to have a care of thoſe women, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
with <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf and with <hi>Clement</hi> in the Goſpel:
That this is the true meaning of the words, is granted by
Popiſh Doctors themſelves commenting upon this place, as
<hi>Juſtinianus</hi> the Jeſuite, Cardinal <hi>Cajetanus, Lyranus;</hi> yea,

                  <hi>The ſecond place alledged by</hi> Bozius, <hi>is from</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 15.
I will endeavour therefore alwayes, that ye alſo may be able to
have remembrance of thoſe things after my departing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ye ask him, how he concludes that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome
<hi>ſucceeded to</hi> Peter <hi>from thoſe words? He tells you,</hi> Peter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64826:142"/>
promiſeth after his death, to put thoſe to whom he wrote in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of thoſe things, or to have a care that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thoſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ye ask him, what then? he tells you,</hi> Since <hi>Peter</hi> was
dead himſelf, he behoved to put them in remembrance by another,
and that other muſt of neceſsity be one who ſucceeded to him in
the Monarchy of the Church. <hi>Let us retex this Logick, that
the Reader may laugh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt he ſuppones, that <hi>Peter</hi> was to put them in remembrance
by another then himſelf, which cannot be gathered from <hi>Peters</hi>
words: he anſwers, <hi>Peter himſelf was dead;</hi> Ergo, <hi>he beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

to do it by another.</hi> It is replyed, <hi>Peter,</hi> while he was yet al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve,
might have a care that they ſhould remember theſe things
after his death: Secondly, the whole current of Popiſh Doctors
contradicts him, affirming, that <hi>Peter</hi> promiſeth to have a care
by himſelf, and not by another, that they ſhould remember
thoſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> From this place they prove interceſſion of
Saints; and ſo according to them, the meaning of <hi>Peter</hi> is, that
when he is departed, he will intercede for them. Thirdly, the
true meaning of <hi>Peter</hi> is, that while he is alive, he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to provide them faithful Paſtors, to inſtruct them,
that they may remember thoſe things: and therefore, his
meaning is nothing leſs then an oecumenick Biſhop: and this
much of <hi>Bozius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſtates the queſtion very perplexedly, and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely,
that it appears to any, he is diffident to make out what
he undertakes: Firſt, he obſerves four things, and then he
falls a diſputing.</p>
               <p>His firſt obſervation is, <hi>That the ſucceſsion of the Biſhop of</hi>
Rome <hi>to</hi> Peter, <hi>in the Monarchy of the Church, is</hi> Jure Divino;
<hi>But the manner or way of ſucceſsion,</hi> ratio ſucceſſionis, <hi>depends
upon the fact of</hi> Peter: which diſtinction of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> is very
obſcure and implicating; he explains himſelf, that <hi>Peter</hi> might
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64826:142"/>
never have fixed his ſeat at <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore it depends
upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>act of <hi>Peter,</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceeds to
him: but he had ſaid before, that <hi>Peter</hi> had fixed his ſeat at
<hi>Rome,</hi> by the command of Chriſt: how can any make ſenſe of
thoſe expreſſions? he involves himſelf here in many contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions;
firſt he affirms, that the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> in the Monarchie of the Church, is <hi>Jure divino,</hi>
or by inſtitution of Chriſt; but that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to <hi>Peter</hi> in the Monarchie of the Church, is not <hi>Jure
divino,</hi> but depends upon the fact of <hi>Peter:</hi> which is as much
to ſay, that the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> is
<hi>Jure divino,</hi> and yet the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceeded not <hi>Jure
divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, he affirms, <hi>That it depended upon the fact of</hi>
Peter, <hi>that he was Biſhop of</hi> Rome: and yet he ſaith, lib. 2.
<hi>Fundatur jus ſuccesſionis Pontificum Romanorum, in eo, quod</hi>
Petrus Romae <hi>ſuam ſedem, jubente Domino, collocaverit, atque
ibidem uſque ad mortem ſederit;</hi> That is, <hi>the right of the
Biſhop of</hi> Rom's <hi>ſucceſſion is founded in this,</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> Peter <hi>at
the command of Chriſt, fixed his Biſhoprick at</hi> Rome, <hi>and did
ſit Biſhop there till his death.</hi> How can thoſe two conſiſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
Firſt, <hi>Peter</hi> was expreſly commanded by Chriſt to fix
his Biſhoprick at <hi>Rome;</hi> Secondly, and yet notwithſtanding,
it was in <hi>Peters</hi> option whether he ſhould do ſo or not? He
might be further preſſed, but it is ſufficient to anſwer here (to
omit his contradictions) that all his ſuppoſitions are falſe: firſt,
it is falſe, that the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> is
<hi>Jure divino,</hi> Secondly, it is falſe, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
ſucceeded to <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> fixed his ſeat at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince
it was proved in the former Book, that <hi>Peter</hi> was not Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> at all. Thirdly it is moſt falſe, that <hi>Peter</hi> at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Chriſt, fixed his ſeat at <hi>Rome,</hi> neither doth he bring
any thing to prove it, beſide his own aſſertion: theſe three
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64826:143"/>
places, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18, and 19. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 15. (though it
were granted that <hi>Peter</hi> was ordained by Chriſt Monarch of
the Church by them, which was proved falſe in the former
Book) mentions nothing of the fixing his ſeat at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond obſervation of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is this, <hi>If ye abſolutely
aſk</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>by divine inſtitution, be
Monarch and Head of the Church? it is anſwered, certainly he is.</hi>
Where he involves himſelf in another contradiction: in the
former obſervation he affirmed, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> his
ſucceſſion to <hi>Peter</hi> depended upon the fact of <hi>Peter,</hi> which
he granted was changable; but nothing can be by divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
which depends upon an uncertainty.</p>
               <p>His third obſervation is very admirable, <hi>The Biſhop of</hi>
Rome, <hi>as the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, (ſaith he) <hi>ſucceeds not to</hi> Peter
<hi>Jure divino,</hi> and yet <hi>eſt de fide;</hi> that is, we are oblieged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, as an article of Faith: which is very myſterious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
how can we belive that by divine Faith, which is not
revealed by God? he anſwers, <hi>We are oblieged to believe it, as
well as that</hi> Paul <hi>left his Cloak and Parchments at</hi> Troas.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, thoſe things are expreſly mentioned in
Scripture, and its very ſtrange, that the Scripture ſhould men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Cloak and Parchments of <hi>Paul,</hi> and not mention the
Roman Biſhoprick of <hi>Peter,</hi> or the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s ſucceſſion
to <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> goes on, <hi>They are not mentioned expreſly, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by neceſſar conſequence out of Scripture.</hi> It ye ask him
from what places of Scripture? he tells you, <hi>Its a tradition
Apoſtolick:</hi> If ye ask him how he proves that? he tells you, <hi>by
Councills, Fathers, Inſtitution of Biſhops, Appellations, &amp;c.</hi> and
ſo he takes up the whole diſpute, by producing ſuch probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Where the Reader may obſerve, that after ſuch bragings
of the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome Jure divino,</hi> in the
Monarchie of the Church, the Mountains have brought forth a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64826:143"/>
Mouſe, <hi>viz.</hi> he brings nothing but perverted Teſtimonies of
the Ancients, falſly tranſlated, and many of them forged,
others mutilated, as ſhall appear in this, and the next two
following Books; where alſo it ſhall be proved, by the
Teſtimonies of thoſe ſame Councells and Fathers, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by him, that the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to
<hi>Peter</hi> in the Monarchie of the Church, is a meer fiction, not
known to the Ancients of the firſt ſix Centuries: Its true
indeed, that ſome ambitious Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> contending with
the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for the Primacy, (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
did begin after the Council of <hi>Chalcedon, Anno</hi> 453.)
invented this fiction of the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
to <hi>Peter:</hi> But that it was a new invented fiction, appears by two
reaſons: The firſt is, becauſe the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
28, made the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> equal in Juriſdiction
to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Its true indeed, the ſaid Council gave
the firſt place in dignity to the Biſhop to <hi>Rome,</hi> but it appears
expreſly by the words of the Canon, that it was not by any
reaſon of ſucceſſion to <hi>Peter,</hi> but only becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was the
chief imperial City; the words in the Original are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was the imperial City: where
it is to be obſerved, that <hi>Aetius</hi> for the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
and <hi>Paſchaſinus</hi> for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> had pleaded with
great animoſity for the Primacy before the ſaid Council; both
alledging the ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Neice, (Paſchaſinus</hi>
not mentioning <hi>Tu es Petrus</hi> at all) in the end, the Council
having heard them both at length, pronounced in favour of the
Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> interpreting the ſixth Canon of the
Council of <hi>Neice,</hi> as making all the Patriarchs equal in Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> after which Decree of the
Council, the following Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> deviſed <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi>
pleading for the Primacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64826:144"/>
The ſecond reaſon is, that in the latter end of the ſixth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
<hi>Pelagius Secundus</hi> and <hi>Gregorius Primus,</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi>
pleaded with great animoſity againſt a viſible Head of the
Church, as Derogatory to Chriſt: and <hi>Gregorius</hi> amongſt other
reaſons, uſeth this for one, <hi>that Peter was not univerſal Apoſtle,
or viſible head of the Church,</hi> Epiſtola 32. but more of that
hereafter. Since then before the latter end of the fifth Age,
never any Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> pleaded the ſucceſſion by <hi>Peter</hi> unto
the Monarchie of the Church, and ſince <hi>Gregorius</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the ſeventh Age expreſly diſputed againſt it, it is
evident, that the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> is a
new deviſed fiction: yea, it ſhall be proved, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. that the ſaid
ſucceſſion to <hi>Peter</hi> was held no article of Faith in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the eleventh Age, and not then neither, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great contention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> fourth obſervation is this, <hi>That the univerſal
Biſhoprick, and the Biſhoprick of</hi> Rome, <hi>are not two Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,</hi>
niſi potentia, <hi>and therefore they are but one Biſhoprick:</hi>
wherein he expreſly contradicts himſelf; he ſaid before, that
the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> in the Monarchie
of the Church was <hi>Jure divino,</hi> but as he was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
it was not <hi>Jure divino;</hi> now he makes them one Biſhoprick,
but how can that conſiſt, ſince he had made them before two,
whereof the one was <hi>Jure divino,</hi> and the other not?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> may be asked, Whether the <hi>Pope</hi> be
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he is univerſal Biſhop? or if he be
univerſal Biſhop, becauſe he is Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> (one of the
two muſt of neceſſity follow, ſince they are on Biſhoprick in
effect, and diſtinct only <hi>potentia</hi>) if he affirm he is Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he is univerſal Biſhop; then it followeth, that
<hi>Peter</hi> had been Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> although he had never been at
<hi>Rome:</hi> and conſequently, he was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he was
Biſhop of <hi>Antioch.</hi> If he affirm, he is univerſal Biſhop, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64826:144"/>
he is Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> it follows, he is univerſal Biſhop,
becauſe he is a particular Biſhop, which is againſt nature, and
reaſon: And this much of the ſtating of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> having ſtated the queſtion, falls a diſputing, and
it appears by his firſt Argument more diſtinctly, what he
means, which <hi>Oedipus</hi> himſelf could not gather from his ſtating
of the queſtion: his Argument is this, <hi>One or other of neceſſity
beloved to ſucceed to</hi> Peter <hi>in the Monarchy of the Church,</hi> Jure
divino, <hi>but no other but the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>could ſucceed to him,</hi>
Ergo, <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>ſucceeded to him.</hi> That one or other
behoved to ſucceed to <hi>Peter,</hi> he proves by ſix reaſons, which
in effect is the ſum and repetition of all thoſe two prolix diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puts
of his, that the Government of the Church is <hi>Jure divino</hi>
Monarchicall, and that <hi>Peter</hi> was the ſaid Monarch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His firſt reaſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> Becauſe the Church is the end of a Biſhoprick:
ſince the Church is one, therefore there muſt be one Biſhop in the
Church.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, Chriſt is that one Biſhop: that the
Church ſhould have any other Biſhop under Chriſt as a
viſible head, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſuppones falſly; its a ſort of diſputing
called <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> where the thing is taken as granted,
which is the ſtate of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His ſecond reaſon is,</hi> That in the times of the Apoſtles the
Church had a viſible head under Chriſt: But the Government of
the Church is ever the ſame.</p>
               <p>But its anſwered, it is falſe, that in the times of the
Apoſtles the Church had a viſible head; as was prolixly,
proved, <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>His third reaſon is of the ſame mettal, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 15. Chriſt
ſaith to <hi>Peter, Paſce oves meas, Feed my Sheep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, that paſſage was prolixly anſwered
before.</p>
               <p>His fourth reaſon is, by <hi>feeding of the ſheep of Chriſt,</hi> is meaned,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64826:145"/>
                  <hi>feeding of all the Sheep of Chriſt, which none but one viſible Head
could do.</hi> But that objection was alſo anſwered before, <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His fifth reaſon is, from</hi> 1 Cor. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1. The head cannot ſay
unto the feet, I have no need of you. <hi>From which place he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
thus:</hi> The Church (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) is compared to a humane
Body with a Head, here the Head is brought in ſpeaking to the
Members, that it cannot ſay, <hi>I have no need o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Or, which is all
one, this Head of the Church hath need of the Members, but this
muſt be another Head then Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt hath no need of
the Members.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, this is a flat abuſing of Scripture: the
ſcope of the Apoſtle in that place is to ſhow, that although
ſome in the Church have more excellent Gifts then others;
yet, the fellowſhip and endeavours of thoſe of mean Gifts is
neceſſar, for the edification of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he proves,
by a ſimilitude taken from a humane Body, where ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are more noble, as the Head; ſome leſs, as the Feet:
<q>And (ſaith he) as he Head cannot ſay unto the Feet, I
have no need of you, or ye are not neceſſary to the Body;
So they of more excellent Gifts in the Church, cannot ſay
unto thoſe of meaner Gifts, we have no need of you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are ye neceſſary for the edification of the Church:</q>
That this is the true expoſition of this place, appears
by the Interpretation of all the Ancients, as <hi>Ambroſius,
Chryſoſtomus, Theophylactus,</hi> whoſe Interpretation is alſo
followed by thoſe two Leaders of the School-men <hi>Lombardus</hi>
and <hi>Aquinas;</hi> neither did ever any Interpreter-dream to prove
a viſible Head out of this place, before the times of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,
as <hi>Bellarmine, Sanderus</hi> and <hi>Turrianus.</hi> Their reaſon
is moſt ridiculous, <hi>There is but one Head of the Body,</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>to which the Church is compared;</hi> Ergo, <hi>there is but
one Head in the Church.</hi> Which Argument may be retorted
thus, <hi>There are but two Feet in the Body, to which the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64826:145"/>
Church is compared;</hi> Ergo, <hi>there are but two Feet in the
Church, or two only in the Church, who have meaner Gifts.</hi>
The Sophiſtry diſcovers it ſelf; for according to the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Ancients, that <hi>one Head of the Body</hi> anſwers to
many perſons in the Church, as appears by the 70. Epiſtle of
<hi>Baſilius</hi> to the Biſhops of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> where he hath
theſe words, <hi>Cum igitur non poſsit Caput Pedibus dicere, Non
eſtis mihi neceſſarii, omnino non tolerabitis nos abdicari; Since
the Head cannot ſay unto the Feet, ye are not neceſſary, ye will
not ſuffer us to be abdicated, or cut off</hi> He repeats the ſame
words, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 77. to the <hi>Tranſmarine</hi> Biſhops. Likewayes,
<hi>Primaſius, Oecumenius,</hi> and the Author of thoſe Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
attributed to <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> compares all Biſhops to that
<hi>one Head of the Body,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Aquinas,</hi> to which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
alſo the <hi>Civil Magiſtrates.</hi> And this much of that
head, mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21.</p>
               <p>Bellarmin's <hi>laſt reaſon to prove,</hi> That the Government of the
Church is <hi>Jure Divino</hi> Monarchical, and conſequently, that one
or other behoved to ſucceed to <hi>Peter, is taken from the High
Prieſt in the Old Teſtament;</hi> under whom the Government of
the Church was Monarchical, <hi>Ergo, (ſaith he</hi>) the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church under the New Teſtament, is <hi>Jure Divino</hi>
Monarchical, under one viſible Head.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, firſt, many things were in the Church-government
in the Old Teſtament, which are not in that of
the New; and therefore the Argument doth not follow.
Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> could not have produced a ſharper Sword
to cut his own throat; for the High-prieſt in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was a Type of Chriſt, and as the ſaid High-prieſt gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Church, without a viſible Head under him in the
Old Teſtament; So Chriſt governs the Church in the New
Teſtament, without a viſible Head under him. And this much
of thoſe reaſons, by which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> endeavours to prove,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64826:146"/>
that one or other behoved to ſucceed to <hi>Peter</hi> in the Monarchy of
the Church.</p>
               <p>In the next place he endeavours to prove, that the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceeded to him; which he doth thus: <hi>Either the
Biſhop of</hi> Antioch, <hi>or elſe the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>ſucceeded to</hi> Peter
<hi>in the Monarchy of the Church: but not the Biſhop of</hi> Antioch,
Ergo, <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, firſt it is falſe, that either the Biſhop of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> or the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceeded to <hi>Peter</hi> in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
of the Church, ſince we proved before, that <hi>Peter</hi> was
not Monarch of the Church himſelf, and therefore no Biſhop
could ſucceed him in the Monarchy of the Church. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
We proved alſo in the laſt Chapter of the firſt Book, that
<hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of no particular Church. Thirdly, though
it were granted, that either the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> or the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> behoved to ſucceed to <hi>Peter</hi> in the Monarchy of
the Church, the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> ought to be preferred to
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> becauſe we have Scripture expreſſe that
<hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> but none at all that he was at <hi>Rome;</hi> but
on the contrary, it appears by infallible preſumptions from
Scripture, that he was never at <hi>Rome,</hi> as was proved in the
laſt Chapter of the former Book; where it was alſo proved,
that the Teſtimonies of thoſe Fathers, by which <hi>Peter</hi> was
proved to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> were grounded on the Authority of
<hi>Pappias,</hi> an Author meriting no credit, in the opinion of
<hi>Euſebius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bellarmine <hi>in the next place endeavours to prove.</hi> That the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceeded to <hi>Peter</hi> in the Monarchy of the Church,
<hi>by ſeveral general Arguments; As,</hi> 1. Teſtimonies of general
Councils. 2. Of Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> themſelves. 3. Of Greek
Fathers. 4. Of Latine Fathers. 5. From Viccars. 6. From
Right of Appellations. 7. From exemption from judgement.
8. From ordination of Biſhops. 9. From Laws, Diſpenſations
and Cenſures. 10. From Names or Titles.</p>

In the following Books, we ſhall not miſs one of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of any moment unanſwered, and not retorted. But, to
avoid repetitions, we will alter his method, diſtinguiſhing the
Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> ſucceſſion to <hi>Peter</hi> in ſeveral Intervals, as
was ſhewed in the Preface of this Treatiſe: in this ſecond Book,
we will diſpute the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi>
in the Monarchy of the Church, from the dayes of the
Apoſtles, untill the death of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> that is, untill <hi>anno,</hi> 260.
or thereabout, inſiſting moſt upon theſe four following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, we will diſpute the occaſion of the opinion of <hi>Aerius,</hi>
by whom it was maintained, unto <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place we will diſpute, that there was no Office
in the Church during that interval, above that of a Biſhop,
unto <hi>cap.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In the third place, we will anſwer what is objected for the
Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in that interval by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
unto <hi>cap</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we will examine ſeveral forgeries, pretended by

All other Church Miniſters were called Deacons or Miniſters
ſimply.</p>
               <p>In the times of the Apoſtles, Biſhops were called Presbyters,
and Presbyters Biſhops; ſo <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. thoſe who are called Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
<hi>verſe</hi> 5. are called Biſhops, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. It appears alſo by
<hi>Philip.</hi> 1. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Acts</hi> 20. that the Rulers of
Churches in one City are called Biſhops in the plural number;
which could not be, if Presbyters were not called Biſhops,
ſince there could be but one Biſhop in one City, as all know.
Thoſe alſo who lived at the ſame time with the Apoſtles,
ſpeak after the ſame manner: <hi>Clement</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> Biſhops in the plural number, directing his
Epiſtle to the <hi>Biſhops and Deacons of Corinth:</hi> and likewayes
in the body of his Epiſtle, he calls thoſe very perſons Biſhops

<hi>Juſtus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſpeaking of the ſucceſſion of Biſhops
in ſeveral Places, calls it a <hi>ſucceſſion of Preſbyters.</hi> Other Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
might be multiplied to this purpoſe, but it is needleſſe,
ſince it is confeſſed by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Petavius,</hi> that in thoſe
primitive times, Presbyters were called Biſhops, and Biſhops
Presbyters promiſcuouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aerius,</hi> who lived about the midle of the fourth Age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
for that reaſon, that the Office of a Biſhop and a
Presbyter in thoſe times was one and the ſame; and that no
Biſhop was <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> above a Presbyter: which opinion
<hi>Epiphanius, Hereſte</hi> 75. calls <hi>Furioſum dogma,</hi> and for that
reaſon, ranks <hi>Aerius</hi> among Hereticks: but he anſwers the
Arguments of <hi>Aerius</hi> vere childiſhly, in the opinion of
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf; for when <hi>Aerius</hi> objected thoſe formentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
paſſages of Scripture, naming many Biſhops in one City,
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> anſwers, the reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe in theſe times
there was ſuch penury of Presbyters, that many Biſhops were
in one City:</hi> then which anſwer, nothing is more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
However, the authority of <hi>Epiphanias</hi> is of no more
weight to make any Opinion Hereſie, then the authority of
ſome other Fathers, who declared them Hereticks who
maintained the <hi>Antipodes, Avertinus, lib. 3. Anal. Auguſtinus</hi>
alſo ſeems to call <hi>Aerius</hi> an Heretick; but its very like, that
he calls him ſo for ſome other reaſon, then denying the divine
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64826:148"/>
right of Biſhops: other things were laid to the charge of
<hi>Aerius</hi> (how juſtly is doubted) it may be alſo that <hi>Auguſtinus</hi>
takes <hi>Hereſie</hi> in a large ſenſe as it comprehends <hi>Schiſme:</hi> for he
profeſſeth himſelf in that place, he knoweth not what is the
regular diſtinction of <hi>Hereſie.</hi> That Schiſmaticks were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
called Hereticks, appears by the ſixth Canon of the
firſt Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which, <hi>In codice canonum,</hi> is 169.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Auguſtine</hi> called not <hi>Aerius</hi> an Heretick, for denying
the divine right of Biſhops, but only for making a ſeparation
upon that account, or elſe for ſome other reaſon, is evident;
becauſe, not only <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> himſelf, but alſo many others of
the moſt eminent Fathers, ſeem to be of the ſame opinion with
<hi>Aerius,</hi> as <hi>Medina</hi> confeſſeth; and although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
reprehend <hi>Medina</hi> for ſo ſaying, yet in end, both are forced
to acknowledge, that ſome of thoſe Fathers were of that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Likewayes, many Popiſh Doctors came very near the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Aerius;</hi> all the Proteſtant Divines abroad, for the moſt
part, are of that opinion; and many learned Proteſtants at
home, as <hi>Whitaker, Reynolds, &amp;c.</hi> although ſome eminent
Engliſh Divines be againſt it, as <hi>Andrews, Hall,</hi> and other
learned men. However, it is certain, that none were more
ſubmiſſive to Epiſcopal Government amongſt the ancient
Fathers, and ſome of the modern Doctors, then thoſe who
diſpute expreſly againſt the divine right of Biſhops; as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtinus
quaeſt.</hi> 101. upon 1 <hi>Tim. 3. Hilarius</hi> upon the ſame
place, and likewayes upon <hi>Epheſ. 4. Hieronymus</hi> in his Epiſtle
to <hi>Euagrius,</hi> and likewayes upon <hi>Tit. 1. Ambroſius</hi> (as he is
cited by <hi>Amalarius</hi>) upon <hi>Tim. 3. Chryſoſtomus</hi> and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
<hi>Theophylactus, Primaſius oecumenius Sedulius</hi> upon <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.
and among the late Fathers, <hi>Amalarius, Iſidorus, Rabanus Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi>
amongſt the Popiſh Divines, <hi>Cuſanus, lib. 2. de concordia
Catholica, cap. 13. Contarenus</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius, Carthuſianus</hi> on
<hi>Philip. 1. Durandus in Rationali,</hi> lib. 2. cap. <hi>de Sacerdotibus,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64826:148"/>
and likewayes upon the ſentences, <hi>lib. 4. diſt. 34. q. 5. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius
Patavinus,</hi> dict. cap. 15. <hi>Haymo</hi> on <hi>Philip. 1. Aſorius</hi>
the Jeſute, <hi>P. 2. Q. 2. cap.</hi> 16. All which Popiſh Doctors
came very near the opinion of <hi>Aerius,</hi> and yet were very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
to Epiſcopal Government: <hi>Whitaker,</hi> a moſt ſtout
defender of <hi>Aerius,</hi> yet was moſt ſubmiſſive to the Epiſcopal
Government; and many of the moſt eminent Divines abroad,
who defended the opinion of <hi>Aerius,</hi> yet in their Epiſtles to
ſeveral Engliſh Divines, they exhort diſſatisfied perſons, to
ſubmit to the Government of the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
which in effect is, the ſame with that Church Government
which was eſtabliſhed by the firſt general Council of <hi>Neice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who follow the opinion of <hi>Aerius,</hi> affirm, that the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the beginning, was nothing elſe but the
firſt Presbyter, or firſt ordained Presbyter, amongſt the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
of the Church of <hi>Rome: Hilarius</hi> by many cited by the
name of <hi>Ambroſius</hi>) upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. affirms, that in thoſe primitive
times, a Biſhop was nothing elſe but <hi>primus Presbyter,</hi> that is,
<hi>Presbyter of oldeſt ordination,</hi> and he dying, the next in order
coming to be firſt Presbyter, became <hi>hoc ipſo</hi> Biſhop, without
any new ordination; as appears by the the ſame Author,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. where he expreſly affirms, when any is ordained
<hi>Sacerdos,</hi> he is ordained both Biſhop and Presbyter; for,
ſaith he, <hi>Una eſt ordinatio Presbyteri &amp; Epiſcopi, quia uterque
eſt Sacerdos.</hi> That is, <hi>The ordination of a Biſhop and Presbyter
in one, becauſe both are Prieſts:</hi> Whence it appears that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
is miſtaken, who affirms, that a firſt Presbyter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
to be ordained of new, when he became Biſhop, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the opinion of that Author: <hi>Petavius</hi> grants, that
a firſt Presbyter became Biſhop, without any new formall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
but it was requiſite that he ſhould be conſecrated by a
ſecret impoſition of hands, called by him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that
is, <hi>a myſticall impoſition of hands;</hi> but he brings no probation,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64826:149"/>
he only affirms, it. We read of ſuch a ſecret impoſition of
hands, not in that caſe, but in other two: the firſt, is, when
<hi>Miletius</hi> troubled all <hi>Aegypt</hi> by his ordaining without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
thoſe whom he ordained were not formally re-ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but only conſecrated by that <hi>ſecret impoſition of hands,
or privat impoſition of hands,</hi> as witneſſeth <hi>Theodoretus, lib. 1.
cap.</hi> 10. The other caſe is, thoſe who were baptized by
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> were not re-baptized, but only anointed with the
Chriſme, together with that <hi>ſecret impoſition of hands:</hi> both
the one and the other caſe is mentioned by <hi>Juſtinus, in Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
ad Orthodox.</hi> It is to be obſerved, that although the
firſt Presbyter was called Biſhop, <hi>Antonemaſticè,</hi> yet the
other Presbyters were called Biſhops; and the firſt Presbyter
ſometimes <hi>Epiſcopus Epiſcoporum, Biſhop of Biſhops;</hi> ſo the
Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> is called by <hi>Clement,</hi> when the ſaid <hi>James</hi> was
Biſhop or firſt Presbyter of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> whence appears, the
weakneſs of that objection of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> proving that the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was reputed oecumenick Biſhop, becauſe he is
ſtiled by ſome, <hi>Epiſcopus Epiſcoporum, Biſhop of Biſhops.</hi>

               <p>THe firſt ſtep then of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (in the opinion

(if we durſt affirm it) that <hi>Salmaſius</hi> is in a miſtake, affirming
that <hi>Biſhop</hi> is only a word of care, tutelage, or curatory, and
not a word of rule or command: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo is in a miſtake,
who eludes that paſſage of <hi>Auguſtine, a Biſhop is greater
then a Presbyter by conſuetude;</hi> affirming the meaning of
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> to be, that before the times of Chriſtians, the
word <hi>Biſhop</hi> was not a title of honour, but by the conſuetude
of Chriſtians, it became to be ſo.</p>
               <p>The time when Epiſcopacy did firſt begin, is gueſſed to he
about the latter end of the ſecond Age, when <hi>Victor</hi> was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome:</hi> which conjecture is proved by two reaſons:
The firſt is this, <hi>Ambroſius</hi> on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. (as he is cited by
<hi>Amalarius</hi>) affirms, <hi>That after Epiſcopacy was brought in,
Presbyters were called no more Biſhops as they were before, nor
were Biſhops called Presbyters:</hi> but we read in the Epiſtles of
<hi>Victor,</hi> that <hi>Presbyters are called Biſhops, and Biſhops Presbyters,</hi>
as was before-mentioned; but after the time of <hi>Victor</hi> we
find, that neither Biſhops are called Presbyters, nor Presbyters
Biſhops: whereby it is very probable, that in thoſe dayes a
Biſhop was diſtinguiſhed from a Presbyter. The ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is this, <hi>Ignatius</hi> (falſly believed to be the Diſciple of
<hi>John</hi>) lived about that time, and in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
calls Epiſcopacy <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a new Ordination,</hi> whence
it appears, it did begin about that time. That the ſaid <hi>Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
lived in thoſe dayes (and conſequently could not be that
<hi>Ignatius</hi> who was the diſciple of <hi>John</hi>) appears, becauſe he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64826:150"/>
mentions the hereſie of <hi>Valentinus,</hi> who affirmed, <hi>that Chriſt
proceeded from Siges;</hi> which Hereſie was never heard of, till
immediatly before the times of <hi>Victor;</hi> and therefore the ſaid
<hi>Ignatius</hi> behoved to live after the time of <hi>Valentinus,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
about the time of <hi>Victor.</hi> To which two reaſons,
may be added a third, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the ſaid <hi>Magneſians</hi> and
<hi>Tralliani</hi> were ſo averſe from receiving of Biſhops, (as if thoſe
<hi>Tralliani</hi> had been ſo called after Mr. <hi>Robert Trail</hi>) that <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
was forced to ſpend much Rhetorick, to perſwade them
to receive a Biſhop: but it is very unlike they would have
been ſo refractory, if Biſhops had been among them from the
beginning: And this much of the original of Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>As for the progreſs; Biſhops were not brought in, in all
places at one time, but by degrees, firſt at one place, then at
another: It is very like they firſt began at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that
<hi>Victor</hi> was the firſt Biſhop that ever was; he was a very aſpire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man, and for his preſumption, was ſharply rebuked by <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi>
and bitterly mocked by <hi>Tertullian:</hi> and therefore, it's
very unlike ſuch an alteration of Government could begin in
any other City then <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the chief Imperial
City: for which reaſon, <hi>Potentior principalitas,</hi> a more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
principality was attributed to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,
by reaſon of which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and alſo by reaſon that
the Traditions of the Apoſtles were preſerved more purely
there, it is neceſſary that all Churches conform themſelves to
that Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Epiſcopacy was not eſtabliſhed in all places at once,
in alike perfection, is evident by three reaſons. The firſt is,
when Presbyters in other places had no ordination, they had
it ſtill at <hi>Alexandria</hi> unto the times of <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius,</hi>
which was about <hi>Anno</hi> 235. as is teſtified by <hi>Ambroſius</hi> (by
ſome thought <hi>Hilarius</hi>) on <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. and <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> (if he
be the Author) on <hi>Tim. 1. 3. quaeſt.</hi> 101. upon the Old and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64826:150"/>
New Teſtament, and <hi>Hieronymus</hi> in his Epiſtles to <hi>Euagrius.</hi>
The ſecond reaſon is, when Biſhops only confirmed in the
Weſt, Presbyters confirmed throughout all the Eaſt, as is
teſtified by <hi>Cyrillus Hieroſol mitanus,</hi> in his Catechiſe <hi>de Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi>
and <hi>Severus Alexandrius, de Ritibus Baptiſmi.</hi> The
third reaſon is, when in many places Biſhops had ſole ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſole juriſdiction, in <hi>Africa</hi> they were inhibited, and
expreſly forbidden, either to ordain or to exerciſe juriſdiction,
without concurrence of Presbyters; as appears by the 22. and
24. Canons of the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Epiſcopacy was univerſally eſtabliſhed, was as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
as when it firſt began. <hi>Hieronymus</hi> affirms, it was decreed
<hi>through the whole world; Ambroſius</hi> or <hi>Hilarius</hi> affirms, it
was eſtabliſhed <hi>proſpiciente concilio;</hi> but none could tell, as
Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> objects, what either the one or the other meaned?
but of late it is diſcovered, that both mean the 4. Canon of
the firſt Council of <hi>Neice. Eutychius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
in his Books <hi>de originibus</hi> (newly publiſhed in Arabick
and Latine by <hi>Seldenus</hi>) teſtifies, <hi>that</hi> Alexander <hi>Biſhop of</hi>
Alexandria, <hi>did take the power of ordination from the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
there, who before that time had the power of ordaining their
Biſhop.</hi> And ſince <hi>Eutychius</hi> affirms, that the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi>
was preſent at the Council of <hi>Neice,</hi> without all queſtion, he
inhibited Presbyters to ordain the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> by
authority of the ſaid 4. Canon of the Council of <hi>Neice;</hi>
neither could any authority, except that of a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
eſtabliſh any thing univerſally; neither was there any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council, before that of <hi>Neice.</hi>

               <head>CAP. IV. Wherein a Biſhop differs from a Presbyter? Conjectures of
Aerians wherefore Epiſcopacy was brought in the Church?</head>
               <p>AFter Epiſcopacy was eſtabliſhed, a Biſhop differs from a
Presbyter by ordination: whence nothing is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
with <hi>Auguſtinus, Hieronymus, Ambroſius, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomus,</hi>
and other Fathers, then <hi>that a Biſhop differs from a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
by ordination,</hi> which is all the Argument that <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
and others produce to prove, that the forſaid Fathers were for
the divine right of Biſhops: But ſince thoſe Fathers expreſly
diſpute againſt the divine right of Biſhops, ſince they tell a
reaſon wherefore Epiſcopacy was brought in, ſince they tell
the time when, (albeit obſcurely) it is evident, that thoſe
Fathers ſpeaks ſo, according to the conſuetude of their own
times; that is, <hi>Biſhops have ordination, and Presbyters have it
not, not by divine right, but only by conſuetude:</hi> yea, <hi>Hierony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
upon <hi>Titus,</hi> after he hath diſputed moſt vehemently
againſt the divine right of Biſhops, concludes his diſpute with
theſe words, <hi>Ita Epiſcopi noverint ſe magis conſuetudine quam
diſpoſitionis dominicae veritate Presbyteris eſſe majores;</hi> That
is, <hi>Biſhops ſhould know that they are greater then Presbyters,
more by conſuetude then divine right;</hi> which paſſage is ſo
evident, that not only <hi>Medina,</hi> but alſo <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro,
Albertus Pighius, Petavius,</hi> yea, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi>
are forced to confeſſe, that <hi>Hieronymus</hi> was againſt the divine
right of Biſhops: which laſt, calls him a waſpiſh man, and that
he was irritated by <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reaſons wherefore Epiſcopacy was brought in, are
three, according to thoſe Fathers: the firſt reaſon is of</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſius
(<hi>or according to ſome</hi> Hilarius) <hi>upon</hi> Epheſ. 4. <hi>who
after he had told, that in the primitive times, a Biſhop was no
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64826:151"/>
other then a firſt Presbyter, or the Presbyter of oldeſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in any City; he ſubjoynes, that Biſhops were after that
time, not by ſucceſſion, but by election;</hi> becauſe the firſt
Presbyter was many times unworthy, and therefore not the firſt,
but the moſt worthy was choſen biſhop. <hi>The ſecond reaſon is of</hi>
Ambroſius (<hi>as he is cited by</hi> Amalarius) <hi>upon 1 Tim</hi> 3. (viz)
becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>resbyters, in following times, had not ſuch eminent
gifts, as thoſe who lived in the primitive times; therefore it
was not fit, that the Church ſhould be governed alike by them
all any more therefore the moſt eminent in gifts, of the number
of Presbyters, was choſen Biſhop, differing from the other
Presbyters by Ordination; and he who was ſo choſen, was
no more called Presbyter, but Biſhop: and the other Presbyters
were no more called Biſhops, but only Presbyters: <hi>the third
reaſon is of</hi> Hieronymus <hi>upon</hi> Tit. 1. <hi>who affirms, Biſhops
were brought in, to take away Schiſms, ſuch as when one ſaid,</hi>
he was of Paul, another he was of Cephas, another he was of
Apollos.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petavins hierarchiae, lib. 1. cap. 10. num.</hi> 8. and in other
places, accknowledgeth, <hi>that the Office of a Biſhop and a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
concurred in one Perſon in ſome Cities in the times of the
Apoſtles:</hi> but he endeavours to prove, by this paſſage of
<hi>Hieronymus,</hi> that cuſtome was changed in the times of the
Apoſtles themſelves; (<hi>viz.</hi>) when that Schiſme was among
the Corinthians, <hi>one ſaying he was of Paul; another he was of
Cephas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> by the ſame paſſage,
endeavour to bind contradictions upon <hi>Hieronymus;</hi> becauſe
he aſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ms on <hi>Tit. 1. that according to Paul, a Biſhop and a
Presbyter is all one;</hi> and in the ſame place he affirms, <hi>that
according to</hi> Paul <hi>they were made different a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
(viz.) when that Schiſme was among the Corinthians,</hi>
which Schiſme was before <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his firſt Epiſtle to the
Corinthians, which firſt Epiſtle, was written long before the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64826:152"/>
Epiſtle to <hi>Titus:</hi> But it is anſwered, it is very ſtrange, that
any eminent perſon as Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> ſhould own ſuch a <hi>Proter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum
Sophiſma;</hi> and therefore, to return the ſharp edge of the
Weapon, whereas they ſtrike only with the blunt, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
thus; <hi>Hieronymus</hi> affirmeth, according to <hi>Paul, Tit. 1.
The Office of a Biſhop and a Presbyter is one and the ſame; Ergo,</hi>
it cannot be the meaning of <hi>Hieron mus,</hi> that they were made
different preciſely at that time, when that Schiſme was among
the Corinthians, ſince he could not be ignorant, that Schiſme
fell out long before <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus:</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
then of <hi>Hieronymus</hi> is, not to tell preciſely the time
when? but only the cauſe why? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Biſhop was made different from
a Presbyter, (<hi>viz.) Schiſme,</hi> ſuch as that among the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
not that very Schiſme among the Corinthians: which
maner of ſpeaking is not only frequent, but alſo elegant, as can
be made out both by Scripture, and prophane Authors, if it
were needful, or any verſed in either, had the Brow to deny it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. What primacy the Biſhop of Rome had before other Biſhops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the times of Cyprian.</head>
               <p>ANd this much of the original, progreſs and univerſal
eſtabliſhment of Epiſcopacy, of the difference between
a Presbyter and a Biſhop, and for what reaſons Biſhops
were brought in. Now it is requiſite to declare, what Primacy
was due to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> during that time, when no
Office was in the Church above that of a Biſhop? (<hi>viz</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who lived about <hi>Anno</hi> 250. or 60.
that is, ſeventy or eighty years before the Council of <hi>Neice.</hi>
During then that interval, we find two ſort of priorities among
Biſhops, neither of which imported any authority or juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of one Biſhop above another; they imported only a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64826:152"/>
priority of precedency or place. The firſt was, priority of
Age, that is, he who was firſt ordained Biſhop, had the place of
him who was ordained after him; and in that reſpect, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of Biſhops was ambulatory in every Province; except
the Biſhop of the firſt City of the Province, where the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Governour remained; and that Biſhop had the place of
all the Biſhops of the Province, although later ordained then
any of them, and was called <hi>Primae Sedis Epiſcopus,</hi> or <hi>Biſhop
of the firſt Seat,</hi> which was the other ſort of priority among
Biſhops. In a word then, the Biſhop of the firſt City of the
Province, had a fixed priority; Biſhops of the other Cities
had an ambulatory priority, that is, now one, now another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the time of their ordination: and for that reaſon,
they were all called <hi>Secundae Sedis Epiſcopi,</hi> or, <hi>Biſhops of the
ſecond Seat,</hi> not ſome of them <hi>Biſhops of the third, and others
of the fourth Seat,</hi> becauſe now this Biſhop, then another; or
now Biſhop of this City, then of another, was Biſhop of the
ſecond Seat, according to the priority of his ordination. It is
to be obſerved, that after <hi>Juſtinianus,</hi> the priority of the firſt
Biſhops themſelves, or Biſhops of the firſt Seat, was made am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatory
in <hi>Africa,</hi> by a Conſtitution of the ſaid <hi>Juſtinianus;</hi>
except only the Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who ſtill remained fixed
firſt Biſhop, whether he were of older or newer ordination;
becauſe <hi>Carthage</hi> was the firſt City of the firſt Province of
<hi>Africa.</hi> In like manner, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was the fixed
firſt Biſhop of all the world, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was the firſt City
of the firſt Province of the world; and for that reaſon (as
we ſaid) <hi>potentior principalitas,</hi> or, <hi>a more powerful principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
was attributed to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> The
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe dayes was of no further extent then
the walls of the City, as is at large demonſtrated by <hi>Salmaſius;</hi>
for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> then was only a Biſhop, and was neither
Metropolitan, nor Patriarch, much leſs an oecumenick Biſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:64826:153"/>
That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was firſt Biſhop, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was
the firſt City of the Empire, and for no other reaſon, appears
not only by what is ſaid, but alſo, becauſe for the ſame reaſon,
he was declared <hi>firſt Metropolitan</hi> by the ſecond general
Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>firſt Patriarch</hi> by the fourth
general Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and <hi>oecumenick Biſhop</hi> by
<hi>Phocas,</hi> as ſhall be declared hereafter at large: whereby
it is evident, That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> had ſtill the priority
for civil reſpects, and by humane ordination, and not at all
by divine inſtitution, or by reaſon of ſucceſſion to <hi>Peter;</hi>
for in that reſpect, the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he is Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
or rather founded the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> before ever he ſaw
<hi>Rome:</hi> and whereas <hi>Petavius,</hi> and others affirm, that the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſucceſſor to <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> died at
<hi>Rome;</hi> it is frivolous, 1. Becauſe <hi>Velenus, Salmaſius,</hi> and
others prove by unanſwerable reaſons, that <hi>Peter</hi> neither
lived, nor died at <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, was never at <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe
reaſons were ſummed in the former Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 24. 2. Becauſe
<hi>Peter,</hi> although he had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet was never Biſhop
at <hi>Rome,</hi> but only in a large ſenſe, (<hi>viz.) as Biſhop</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<hi>the founder of any Church,</hi> in which ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> may be
called <hi>the Biſhop of Corinth, Theſſalonica,</hi> &amp;c. yet in that reſpect,
<hi>Paul</hi> is to be preferred to <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe he not only founded the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as all agree, and not <hi>Peter</hi> as many affirm;
but alſo, although he and <hi>Peter</hi> had founded the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> joyntly, he is to be preferred to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome;</hi>
becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was a City of the Gentiles, expreſly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
under the Apoſtolat of <hi>Paul,</hi> whereas the Jews were
only committed to <hi>Peter;</hi> and for that reaſon, in the Seals
annexed to the Popes Bulls, unto this day, the Images of <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> are joyntly imprinted, and that of Paul hath <hi>the right
hand;</hi> many admire why? but the reaſon can be no other,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64826:153"/>
then what we have told, (<hi>viz.) becauſe although</hi> Peter
<hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>are believed joyntly to have founded the Church of
Rome, and therefore the image of both is imprinted in the Seals,</hi>
yet that of <hi>Paul</hi> hath the right hand, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was under
the Apoſtolat of <hi>Paul,</hi> and not of <hi>Peter,</hi> as we ſaid. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
it is agreed by all, that <hi>Paul</hi> died at <hi>Rome,</hi> but not that
<hi>Peter,</hi> and it is thought, that none of the Ancients knew
where <hi>Peter</hi> died? one thing is certain, that <hi>Clement</hi> third
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſpeaking of the deaths of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>
(to both whom he was contemporary) and who was called by
<hi>Paul</hi> his fellow-labourer, although in his Epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
he ſpeaks more particularly of the martyrdome of
<hi>Paul,</hi> when and where he died, and under whom; yet, he
doth not mention the death of <hi>Peter</hi> ſo particularly: which he
would have done, if <hi>Peter</hi> had died at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the ſame day
with <hi>Paul,</hi> as the Romaniſts affirm. 3. If the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> have any priority, by reaſon of <hi>Peters</hi> dying at <hi>Rome;</hi>
the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is to be preferred to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
becauſe Chriſt died at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> yea, for that reaſon, the
foreſaid <hi>Clement</hi> ſeems to call <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle (thought to
be the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem) Epiſcopum Epiſcoporum, or,
Biſhop of Biſhops;</hi> which Epithet, if any had given to the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe dayes, <hi>Bellarmime</hi> and <hi>Barronius</hi> would have
blacked many ſheets of paper with repetitions of that Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
ingeminating it every where, as they do other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of far leſs moment: In what ſenſe <hi>Clement</hi> calls <hi>James</hi>
Biſhop of Biſhops, ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. The Teſtimonies of Dionyſius and Ignatius, againſt the Biſhop
of Romes Supremacy.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>AENeas Silvius,</hi> (afterwards the Pope under the name
<hi>Pius</hi> ſecond) in his 288. Epiſtle (according to the
ſupputation of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) affirms that before
the Council of <hi>Neice,</hi> little or no regaird was had, to the
Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> which confirms what we
ſaid before, <hi>viz.</hi> that before the times of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the primacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was only of Dignity, but not of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he was Biſhop of the chief Imperial
City, as alſo becauſe he was Biſhop of that particular Church,
commonly believed in thoſe dayes, to have been joyntly
founded by thoſe Princes of the Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
Yet notwithſtanding, ſince the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
endeavour to prove, by Teſtimonies of Fathers, and actions
of Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Supremacy of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> was acknowledged in the firſt three Centuries: in
diſputing this Queſtion, we will obſerve this following
method; firſt, we will prove by Teſtimonies of thoſe Fathers,
who lived in that interval, that the Supremacy of the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not acknowledged in thoſe dayes. Secondly,
we will anſwer what is objected to the contrary from actions
of Popes, and from Teſtimonies of Fathers. Laſtly, we will
diſcover ſeveral forgeries pretended by our Adverſary, to prove
the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in that interval.</p>
               <p>We will firſt aſſault the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
by the Teſtimonies of two much magnified by ſome of that
Church: the firſt is, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whom they affirm to be the
Diſciple o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>St. John;</hi> the ſecond is <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> believed by
them to be the Diſciple of <hi>St. Paul:</hi> and albeit we proved in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64826:154"/>
another place that the pretended <hi>Ignatius</hi> was not the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of <hi>John,</hi> and ſhall prove hereafter, that the pretended
<hi>Dionyſius</hi> was not the Diſciple of <hi>Paul,</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts.</hi>
yet, nevertheleſſe, both the one and the other are very
ancient: we proved elſewhere, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> lived about the
time of <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> when <hi>Dionyſius</hi> lived, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain?
<hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtle to the <hi>Trallians,</hi> hath theſe
words, <hi>What is a Biſhop but he who goeth beyond all command
and power, who commands all as far as a man can command?</hi> In
which words, he expreſly affirms, that there is no Office of
the Church, above that of a Biſhop: for, if a Biſhop have
ſupream command (as he expreſly affirms) he can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by no ſuperior Church-ruler, as Metropolitan, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,
or oecumenick Biſhop. The Teſtimony of <hi>Dionyſius</hi>
is taken from his 8. Epiſtle, his words are theſe in ſubſtance,
<hi>Every man ſhould ſtrive to live blameleſly, if he do not, the
Prieſt ſhould take a courſe with him: if the Prieſt deborde, he
ſhould be judged by his Biſhop: if the Biſhop do amiſs, he ſhould
be judged by the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles: if thoſe again do amiſs,
they ſhould be judged by thoſe of the ſame order, and degree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words he quite excludes one viſible Head over all;
and conſequently it appears, that in his dayes, the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was not believed, as an article
of Faith in the Church: ſince he affirms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that many hold
the chief place of the Hierarchy; whereof any ſhould be judged
by the reſt, and not all by one viſible Head, or by the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What he means by <hi>Succeſſors to the Apoſtles,</hi> whom he
places above Biſhops, none can tell, except he mean,
<hi>Metropolitans and Patriarchs;</hi> if he do, its evident, he lived
after the times of <hi>Cyprian:</hi> becauſe in the dayes of <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
and before, there was no Office in the Church, above that
of a Biſhop, as appears firſt, by that paſſage of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64826:155"/>
his Epiſtle to the <hi>Trallians</hi> now cited. Secondly, it appears
by the Epiſtle of the ſaid <hi>Ignatius,</hi> written to the <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
in the which Epiſtle, he comprehends all Church-rulers
under <hi>Biſhops and Presbyters;</hi> where he affirms, that Biſhops
have the <hi>cheif place</hi> loco Dei, <hi>in place of God; Presbyters have
the next place</hi> conceſſus Apoſtolici loco, that is, <hi>they repreſent
the Council of the Apoſtles;</hi> the laſt place he gives the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
to whom <hi>the Miniſtery of Chriſt is committed.</hi> Thirdly,
that no Office was in the Church, above that of a Biſhop,
before the times of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> nor in his time, appears by
thoſe two following moſt notable paſſages of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the one
in his Books <hi>de unitate Eccleſiae, lib. 4. Epiſt.</hi> 9. the other
from his Oration, to the Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> of which two

               <p>Bellarmine <hi>in the forecited place, expones the words of</hi>
Cyprian <hi>thus;</hi> There is one Biſhoprick (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) in the ſame

Fountain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So is the Church one, and conſequently the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick

but by a diſtinction, that is,</hi> Though every Biſhop have a full
ſhare, yet he hath not an equal ſhare, nor in the ſame manner; for
<hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> have that ſhare
which anſwers to the Head, Root and Fountain; but other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
have that ſhare anſwering to the Branches, Rivolets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This gloſs of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> quite deſtroyes the Text; for,
<hi>Cyprian</hi> compares particular Churches to Branches, Rivolets,
Beams; that <hi>one Biſhoprick</hi> he compares to an Oak, to Light,
to a Fountain, whereby it evidently appears, that by that <hi>one
Biſhoprick</hi> he means not the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is a
particular Biſhoprick, as well as the reſt; and not that great
Biſhoprick, or <hi>one Biſhoprick,</hi> whereof every one hath a full
ſhare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:64826:156"/>
Secondly, that by <hi>unus Epiſcopatus</hi> he means, not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick
of <hi>Peter,</hi> having authority over other Biſhops, is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his words in the ſame Book <hi>de unitate Eccleſiae,</hi> where he
affirms, <hi>Whatever the other Apoſtles were,</hi> Peter <hi>was the ſame;
that all the Apoſtles were equal to</hi> Peter, <hi>in dignity and power:</hi>
whereby it appears, whatever the Biſhoprick of <hi>Peter</hi> was, the
Biſhopricks of the other Apoſtles were equal to it; and ſince
the Biſhopricks of the other Apoſtles were particular Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,
each having a full ſhare of that <hi>one Biſhoprick</hi> mentioned
by <hi>Cyprian;</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Peter</hi> was only a particular
Biſhoprick, and not that <hi>one Biſhoprick</hi> mentioned by <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome</hi> is not that <hi>one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick,</hi>
appears by the expreſs words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> in which (as we ſhall prove
in the next Chapter) he makes any other Biſhop equal in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Sanderus,</hi> in making that <hi>one
Biſhoprick</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Peter,</hi> muſt of neceſſity grant, that
<hi>Peter</hi> only had his Biſhoprick immediatly from Chriſt, and the
other Apoſtles their Biſhopricks from <hi>Peter;</hi> ſince <hi>Sanderus</hi>
expreſly affirms, that all other Biſhopricks flow from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick
of <hi>Peter,</hi> as all mankind had their Original from
<hi>Adam.</hi> But, in averring the Apoſtles to have their Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks
from <hi>Peter, Bellarmine</hi> contradicts firſt <hi>Fran. de victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
who, <hi>relect. 2. quaeſt. 2. concluſ.</hi> 3. and 4. expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
<hi>That the other Apoſtles received all their power, both of
order and juriſdiction, immediatly from Chriſt.</hi> In which
words, he is gloſſing upon that paſſage of <hi>Cyprian, de unitate
Eccleſiae,</hi> which we now mentioned, <hi>Whatever</hi> Peter <hi>was, the
other Apoſtles were the ſame, of alike dignity and power with
him.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> contradicts himſelf, becauſe he
affirms, <hi>That all the Apoſtles were made Biſhops immediatly by
Chriſt, and had their juriſdiction immediatly from him,</hi> lib. 4.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64826:156"/>
cap. 23. <hi>de pont. Rom.</hi> and whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth
diſtinguiſh, that although the other Apoſtles had their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks
immediatly from Chriſt, yet they had them not
<hi>ſecundum plenitudinem poteſtatis,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> had his Biſhoprick
immediatly from Chriſt: <hi>Fran. de victoria</hi> exſibilats that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
as contrary to the mind of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> aſſerting an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
equality of juriſdiction of all the Apoſtles with <hi>Peter,
Fran. de victor. ibid.</hi> And thus we have proved, that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
is a bad interpreter of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in affirming, that <hi>Cyprian</hi>
by <hi>unus Epiſcopatus</hi> means, <hi>the Biſhoprick of</hi> Peter, <hi>or his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
the Biſhop of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>Now let us examine, how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> comments upon thoſe
words of <hi>Cyprian, Cujus pars á ſingulis in ſolidum tenetur?</hi>
That is, <hi>of which Biſhoprick, every Biſhop hath a full ſhare:
Bellarmine</hi> grants, that every Biſhop hath a full ſhare, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
they have <hi>an equal ſhare, or in the ſame manner;</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
that <hi>one Biſhoprick</hi> to a diſſimilar body, <hi>v. g.</hi> to <hi>a Tree,</hi>
he compares the Biſhoprick of <hi>Peter</hi> to the <hi>Root,</hi> other Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks
to the <hi>Branches;</hi> for as the Root, although it be a part
of the Tree, as are the Branches, yet it ſuſtains and rules the
Branches; and therefore, although the Branches have a part
of the Tree <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> yet are they not an equal part of the
Tree; neither are they a part of the Tree, <hi>in that manner
as the root is.</hi> The Root is a part ſuſtaining the Branches, the
Branches again are parts ſuſtained and governed by the Root;
<hi>So</hi> ſaith <hi>Bellarmine, The Biſhoprick of</hi> Peter <hi>and his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
is a part of that</hi> one Biſhoprick <hi>anſwering to the Root, other
Biſhopricks are parts anſwering to the Branches, ruled and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
by the Biſhoprick of</hi> Peter.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this gloſſe, intangles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
firſt in abſurdities, next in contradictions; and firſt,
he intangles himſelf in abſurdities, becauſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> expreſly
compares that <hi>one Biſhoprick to an Oak, a Fountain, a Light,</hi>
which are all ſimilar and homogeneous bodies; of which, every
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64826:157"/>
every part hath the name and nature of the whole; every
part of an <hi>Oak is Oak,</hi> every part of a <hi>Fountain of water, is
water,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is abſurd in affirming,
that <hi>Cyprian</hi> compares that <hi>one Biſhoprick to a disſimilar and
heterogenious body;</hi> the Sophiſtry of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> conſiſts in
this, what <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls <hi>Robur</hi> or an <hi>Oak, Bellarmine</hi> calls
it <hi>Arbor, or a Tree;</hi> the difference is this, any tree may be
conſidered two wayes, firſt, as it is an <hi>organick body</hi> conſiſting
of Root and Branches which are diſſimilar, organick parts:
Secondly, as it is an <hi>homogenius body,</hi> as an Oak, all the
parts of which are <hi>Oak,</hi> both Root and Branches, although
the Root, be not the Branches; and ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
ſophiſticats, in making <hi>Cyprian</hi> compare that <hi>one
Biſhoprick to a Tree, as it is an organick body;</hi> whereas <hi>Cyprian</hi>
compares it to <hi>an Oak, as it is a ſimilar body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Whole</hi> cannot be the ſame with any one <hi>Part;</hi>
nor any one <hi>part</hi> the <hi>whole: Cyprian</hi> maketh that <hi>one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick</hi>
the <hi>whole,</hi> and every particular Biſhoprick <hi>a part.</hi>
But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes the Biſhoprick of <hi>Peter,</hi> and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
the <hi>whole,</hi> or that <hi>one Biſhoprick</hi> mentioned by <hi>Cyprian;</hi>
he likewayes makes it a <hi>part,</hi> in ſhewing, in what manner,
comparatively with others, it hath a ſhare of that <hi>one Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
which is the <hi>whole,</hi> according to his own confeſſion;
and likewayes <hi>a part,</hi> according to his own confeſſion, which is
a manifeſt contradiction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he adds contradiction to contradiction; for in
explaining the way how every Biſhoprick hath a ſhare of
that <hi>one Biſhoprick,</hi> he grants that every <hi>part,</hi> hath a full
ſhare, but not an equal ſhare; which is a flat contradiction,
ſince all <hi>full ſhares</hi> are <hi>equal ſhares,</hi> neither can any <hi>full ſhare</hi>
be more or leſſe then an other <hi>full ſhare.</hi> It is true indeed,
that one Biſhoprick, may be greater in riches, ſplendor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
then an other Biſhoprick; but they are all alike Biſhopricks:
Riches, and Poverty hinders not the Epiſcopal Dignity
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64826:157"/>
and Juriſdiction, as is affirmed by <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> in his Epiſtle
to <hi>Euagrius;</hi> where he affirms, that the meaneſt Biſhop,
is equally a Biſhop with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
which equality of Biſhops is in <hi>eſſentialls;</hi> for the ſuperiority
of an Archbiſhop, above a Biſhop, is in <hi>accidentals,</hi> and was
a <hi>non-ens</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and therefore, he ſpeaks
abſolutely, without reſtriction, of the equality of Biſhops.
And thus we have ſhewed, with what admirable Sophiſtry,
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> endeavours to wreſt the meaning of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> with
whoſe Teſtimony <hi>Rayinundus Rufus</hi> is ſo preſſed, diſputing
againſt <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> that he taxeth the ſaying of <hi>Cyprian</hi> as
erronious: becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>Ulpianus</hi> affirms, <hi>that two perſons,
cannot have dominion</hi> in ſolidum <hi>of one thing; and therefore</hi>
Cyprian <hi>is in an error in affirming, that every Biſhop hath a
part of that one Biſhoprick</hi> in ſolidum.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, <hi>Rufus</hi> is in a miſtake, both in the <hi>Theſe</hi> and
in the <hi>Hypotheſe;</hi> he is miſtaken in the <hi>Theſe,</hi> becauſe the
Lawyers maintain, that more perſons may have dominion
<hi>in ſolidum</hi> of one thing, as of <hi>via aquae ductus, or any Comu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,
as paſturage,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, he is miſtaken in the
<hi>Hypotheſe:</hi> for <hi>Cyprian</hi> is not ſpeaking of the dominion of
things; he is only comparing that <hi>one Biſhoprick, toti ſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
vel univerſali,</hi> the part of which <hi>wholes</hi> equally participate
their name, and definition, as all men do the humane nature,
and all Kings are equally Kings: ſo ſaith <hi>Cyprian,</hi> all <hi>Biſhops
are equally Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turrianus</hi> in his defence againſt <hi>Zadeel lib. 1. cap.</hi> 17. grants,
that <hi>Cyprian</hi> compares that <hi>one Biſhoprick</hi> to a ſimilar body,
but yet he affirms, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> is not to be underſtood
literally; otherwayes he cannot be defended from error: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
ſaith he, <hi>if every Biſhop have a part</hi> in ſolidum <hi>of that</hi>
one Biſhoprick, <hi>he hath that whole</hi> one Biſhoprick: but he
is miſtaken, in confounding ſimilar with diſſimilar bodyes; for,
one having the branch of a tree, hath not all the tree: yet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64826:158"/>
every drop of water hath both the name and definition of the
whole Fountain, or is called water, and is water as well as the
whole water of the Fountain. Secondly, <hi>Turrianus,</hi> to
ſhun this pretended abſurdity, interprets that <hi>one Biſhoprick</hi>
of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to be the <hi>Church;</hi> likewayes, he interprets thoſe
words, <hi>whereof every one hath a full ſhare,</hi> to be, that every
one is bound alike to give an account of his adminiſtration:
but he is miſtaken in both thoſe gloſſes; he is miſtaken in the
firſt, becauſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> expreſly diſtinguiſheth, that <hi>one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick</hi>
from the Church; for immediatly after thoſe words,
<hi>unus Epiſcopatus eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>there is one Biſhoprick,</hi> &amp;c. he ſubjoynes,
<hi>una quoque eſt Eccleſia,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>there is one Church,</hi> &amp;c. whereby it
appears he ſpeaks of <hi>one Biſhoprick and one Church,</hi> as different
things: He is likewayes miſtaken in his other gloſs; for it is
falſe which he affirms, that every one is tyed alike to give an
account of his adminiſtration, ſince it is notorious, that ſome
are tyed to a ſtricter account then others.</p>
               <p>We will cloſe by inſtancing one other anſwer, mentioned
by <hi>Chamier,</hi> but he doth not name the Author: the ſaid
Author grants, that the meaning of <hi>Cyprian</hi> is, that all
Biſhops are alike Biſhops, but he diſtinguiſheth <hi>quo ad ordinem
Sacerdotalem,</hi> and <hi>quo ad Juriſdictionem,</hi> that is <hi>the order
of all the Biſhops is alike, but not the Juriſdiction;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
albeit all Biſhops be equally Biſhops with the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> yet they are not equal with him in Juriſdiction.
<hi>Hayus, diſput. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 12. gives the ſame anſwer, to that
paſſage of <hi>Hieronymus, Epiſt. 85. ad Euagrium:</hi> we ſhall diſcuſs
that diſtinction of <hi>Hayus,</hi> in the following Book, to which it
properly belongs, as concerning the Supremacy of the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the interval of Metropolitans: whereas now we
diſpute only his Supremacy, in the interval of Biſhops. It is
ſufficient for the preſent to anſwer, that the ſaid diſtinction
between <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> is contrary to the meaning of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64826:158"/>
                  <hi>Cyprian;</hi> for it ſhall appear in the following Chapter, that any
Biſhop is equal in Juriſdiction with the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well
as in order, in the opinion of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> becauſe he affirms in his
Oration to the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
cannot judge another Biſhop, no more then he can be judged
by him: but if that be not an equality in Juriſdiction, there
is none at all.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Some Teſtimonies from Cyprians Oration in the Council of
Carthage explained.</head>
               <p>IN the former Chapter we obſerved, by what ſophiſtry
our Adverſaries endeavoured to pervert the meaning of
<hi>Cyprian</hi> in that famous paſſage, found in his Books <hi>de
unitate Eccleſiae.</hi> But, in ſophiſticating thoſe following teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of his, uttered in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> their art is
admirable. From the ſaid Oration, are gathered the following
Teſtimonies: 1. <hi>Neither doth any of us conſtitute himſelf Biſhop
of Biſhops, to compell by tyrannical terror his Colleagues to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Becauſe every Biſhop, by the licence and liberty of his
power, hath his own proper judgement.</p>
               <p>3. He cannot be judged by another Biſhop, neither can he
judge another Biſhop.</p>
               <p>4. Let us all expect the judgment of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
who alone hath power to prefer us, to the Government of the
Church, and to judge our actions.</p>
               <p>Theſe famous teſtimonies of <hi>Cyprian</hi> perplexeth the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men of the Roman Church very much; neither do they
agree in their anſwers, as appears by what followeth. When
<hi>Luther,</hi> in the conference at <hi>Lypſick,</hi> objected thoſe teſtimonies
to <hi>Eccius</hi> againſt the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome; Eccius</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:64826:159"/>
anſwered, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>no man conſtitutes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Biſhop of Biſhops,</hi> ſpeaks againſt thoſe only, who without a
lawful vocation, obtrudes themſelves upon any Church to
govern tyrannically: But this anſwer is naught, becauſe
<hi>Cyprian</hi> in thoſe words, is not ſpeaking how Biſhops ſhould
be conſtitute? but of the power which conſtitute Biſhops
have; as appears not only by thoſe words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> we have
cited, but alſo, by his words uttered after the reading of the
Letters of <hi>Jubaianus,</hi> in the Council: The queſtion ſtated
in the Council was, <hi>whether thoſe who were baptiſed by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
ſhould be re-baptiſed? Cyprian,</hi> after the reading of thoſe
Letters, and ſtating of the queſtion, deſires every one of
them to tell their opinion freely, and not to remove from
their communion, thoſe who were of contrary judgement
to them: and then he ſubjoyns thoſe paſſages we cited in the
beginning of the Chapter, <hi>no man conſtitutes himſelf Biſhop of
Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. whereby it is evident, that he ſpeaks of Biſhops
already conſtitute, and not of the vocation of Biſhops, as
<hi>Eccius</hi> affirms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanderus, lib. 6. cap.</hi> 4. of his <hi>viſib. Monarch.</hi> anſwers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly,
1. that <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks ſo out of humility, ſince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a manner was <hi>Biſhop of Biſhops,</hi> when he preſided
ſeveral times in a Council: But this anſwer is nothing worth,
for <hi>Cyprian</hi> by <hi>Biſhop of Biſhops,</hi> means one who takes
upon him to compell his Colleagues <hi>to neceſſity of obedience,</hi>
as having Juriſdiction over them: but none will affirm, that
he who preſides in a Council, hath that power; almoſt 100,
years after <hi>Cyprian,</hi> it was ordained by the 9. Canon of the
Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that Metropolitans ſhould do nothing
without the conſent of other Biſhops, as inferior Biſhops
could do nothing without them: much leſſe in the times of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
had he who preſided in a Council any Juriſdiction above
his Colleagues; ſince in his dayes, there was no Office in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64826:159"/>
Church above that of a Biſhop, as is believed by many learned
men: and he who was Biſhop <hi>primae ſedis, of the firſt ſeat,
or chief City of the Province,</hi> was conſtant Preſident in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Councils, as <hi>Cyprian,</hi> becauſe he was Biſhop of
<hi>Carthage;</hi> neither had the Preſident of a Council more
authority over his fellow Biſhops, then the Preſident of a
Colledge of Judges, over his fellow Judges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanderus</hi> anſwers, ſecondly, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in thoſe words,
<hi>no man makes himſelf Biſhop of Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. is only ſpeaking
of thoſe Biſhops preſent at the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and
means not the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> at all; which is alſo the
anſwer of <hi>Bellarmine, lib. 2. cap. 16. de pont. Rom.</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
of <hi>Pamelius, in his Annotations upon the foreſaid place
of</hi> Cyprian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it is anſwered, that</hi> Cyprian <hi>is ſpeaking of all Biſhops,
comprehending the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>as well as other Biſhops:
his reaſons are general, as is evident by his words;</hi> No man
(<hi>ſaith he</hi>) makes himſelf Biſhop of Biſhops, becauſe every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
hath <hi>proprium arbitrium, that is,</hi> he hath as much autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to utter his judgement as any other, and when his opinion is
delivered, no Biſhop hath power to compell him to alter it; as he
cannot judge another Biſhop, neither can any other Biſhop judge
him: and therefore, all Biſhops ſhould expect the judgement of
Chriſt, who <hi>only</hi> can judge their actions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is falſe which they affirm, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in thoſe
expreſſions, doth not mean by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> for, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
tom.</hi> 1. in his Annotations upon this Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
affirms, that thoſe words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> were, <hi>tacitè, directed
againſt</hi> Stephanus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome. The queſtion agitated in
the Council was, <hi>Whether thoſe who were baptized by Hereticks,
ſhould be re-baptized? Stephanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was for the
<hi>negative, Cyprian</hi> for the <hi>affirmative; Stephanus,</hi> as <hi>Binius</hi>
relates, and <hi>Caſſander</hi> alſo, <hi>conſult, art.</hi> 37, threatned <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:64826:160"/>
and the Churches of <hi>Africa</hi> with Excommunication, if they
changed not their Opinion: This Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
conſiſting of eighty ſeven Biſhops; <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Oration
to the Council, affirms, <hi>None of us makes himſelf Biſhop of
Biſhops, or takes upon him to compell his Colleagues, by tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
terrors to neceſsity of obedience;</hi> which words, as <hi>Binius</hi>
obſerves, were directed againſt <hi>Stephanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi>
becauſe he had threatned the Biſhops of <hi>Africa</hi> with Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
if they did not alter their Judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanderus</hi> anſwers thirdly, that albeit <hi>Cyprian</hi> did aſſert the
equality of Biſhops in thoſe words: yet, it was only an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
according to their Order of Prieſthood, not according to
their Juriſdiction: albeit the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> be equal to other
Biſhops, as he is Biſhop, yet he is above them in juriſdiction;
he gives this anſwer, <hi>lib. 7. cap.</hi> But it is replyed, this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is frivolous, and quite contrary to the meaning of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
whoſe intention in thoſe words, is expreſly to aſſert the
equality of Juriſdiction: and ſince he aims at the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> it is evident in his opinion, that any Biſhop is of equal
juriſdiction to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> How can any be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
to deny, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> aſſerts equality of Juriſdiction?
ſince he expreſly affirms, <hi>No Biſhop can judge another Biſhop,
nor be judged by him; Chriſt is the only judge of Biſhops;</hi>
which in right down terms is, that all Eiſhops are equal in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
which none but a Sophiſter will deny.</p>
               <p>It is needleſs to mention the anſwers of other Romaniſts,
as of <hi>Alanus Copus, lib. 1. cap.</hi> 19. and <hi>Dormanus</hi> in his Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Treatiſe againſt Biſhop <hi>Jewel, cap.</hi> 10. ſince they are not
worth the refuting. The moſt ingenuous anſwer of them all,
is that of <hi>Stapleton, lib. 11. cap. 7. de princip. fid. doctrin.</hi>
where he affirms, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in thoſe words, to patronize
his error, <hi>Utitur verbis errantium, and that he ſeems wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to protect Hereticks</hi> (he means Proteſtants) <hi>againſt the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64826:160"/>
Supremacy of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome: he calls thoſe expreſſions
<hi>O Cyprian</hi> pernicious, if they be not defended by a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Expoſition.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, the authority of <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> is of more
moment, then the authority of <hi>Stapleton,</hi> who not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
thoſe expreſſions of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but alſo recommends
them to the whole Church, to be taken notice of as ſo many
Oracles, and that in moe places then one, as <hi>lib. 2. cap. 2. lib. 3.
cap. 3. lib. 6. cap.</hi> 7. againſt the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> Further, that
<hi>Stephanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf, underſtood thoſe words
of <hi>Cyprian</hi> as the Proteſtants do, againſt the juriſdiction of
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> appears by his excommunicating <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
as <hi>Caſſander</hi> relates, <hi>conſult. art.</hi> 7. neither read we ever of
his reconciliation, as is confeſſed by <hi>Bellarmine, lib. 2. de con.
cap.</hi> 5. Neither is it of any moment, what they object, that in
that queſtion <hi>of re-baptizing thoſe who were baptized by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
the <hi>affirmative</hi> maintained by <hi>Cyprian</hi> was wrong, and
the <hi>negative</hi> maintained by <hi>Stephanus</hi> was right: for, the ſtate
of the queſtion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this particular,
is, Whether <hi>Cyprian</hi> was for or againſt the Supremacy of the
Biſhops of <hi>Rome?</hi> or, whether he did right in oppoſing the
uſurpation of <hi>Stephanus?</hi> It ſeems he did, for two reaſons,
firſt, becauſe thoſe expreſſions of his were recommended by <hi>St.
Auguſtine</hi> to the whole Church: next, becauſe notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his dying excommunicate by <hi>Stephanus,</hi> he was held
ever ſince thoſe times to be a Saint and a Martyr, by the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, as he is at this day: whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that the ancient Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> immediatly after the
times of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> had not much regard to the authority of
<hi>Stephanus</hi> his excommunicating <hi>Cyprian.</hi> The truth is, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
in that conflict with <hi>Stephanus, was a good Patron of an
evil cauſe;</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> was <hi>a bad Patron of an good Cauſe:
Cyprian</hi> was wrong, in maintaining re-baptization of thoſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64826:161"/>
who were baptized by Hereticks, but he defended it rightly:
<hi>Stephanus,</hi> who maintained the contrary opinion, was right,
but maintained it badly, that is, by uſurpation, arrogancy and
preſumption.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of the conteſt between Victor Biſhop of Rome, and the Biſhops
of the Eaſt.</head>
               <p>WE have in the former Chapters proved, by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Ancients, that the ſupremacy of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was not believed as an Article of
Faith, in the dayes of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> nor any time before unto the
dayes of the Apoſtles. We have alſo ſhewed, with what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
ſophiſtry our Adverſaries endeavour to elude the force
of thoſe teſtimonies. In the following Chapters, we will
examine what is objected by our Adverſaries, to prove the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in that interval. If it had
been an Article of Faith in the Church, that the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> was ordained by <hi>Peter,</hi> to ſucceed to himſelf in that
Function of oecumenick Biſhop, or that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
did ſucceed to <hi>Peter</hi> in that Function, the evidence of that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
had been greater, in theſe primitive times, then it was
afterwards: but contrarily, we find the nearer we come to the
Apoſtles times, the leſs evidence we find, for the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> whereby it appears, that the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of his ſucceſſion to
<hi>Peter,</hi> is but a fiction: neither was it ever urged, as to juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
till after the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as ſhall appear in the
following Books, and the more the times were remote, that
opinion of the ſucceſſion to <hi>Peter</hi> increaſed the more.</p>
               <p>That there was no great evidence before the Council of
<hi>Neice,</hi> of the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64826:161"/>
by <hi>Aeneas Silvius,</hi> Pope himſelf, in his 288. Epiſtle,
and yet he was the greateſt Antiquary of his time: the truth
of his aſſertion will appear by our Anſwers to that which they
object, which are ſo many teſtimonies againſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>To prove the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in that
interval, they object nothing (beſide what we ſhall prove
forged by teſtimony of their own Doctors) before the latter
end of the ſecond Age, or beginning of the third; and then
their objections are of two ſorts, firſt <hi>actions of Popes;</hi> ſecondly,
<hi>tectimonies of Popes and Fathers.</hi> What regaird ſhould be
had to the actions and teſtimonies of Popes, appears by the
Commentaries which Pope <hi>Aeneas Silvius,</hi> or <hi>Pius</hi> ſecond,

men conſider, theſe teſtimonies they magnifie ſo much are
either of Popes themſelves, inlarging their own intereſts, or
of their Fathers.</hi> We will firſt treat of the actions of Popes,
and next examine their teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>Before the time of <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of antiquity for the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
beſides ſome forgeries, acknowledged by the moſt eminent
Doctors of that Church, and proved to be forgeries by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable
reaſons, as ſhall appear afterwards in the laſt
Chapters of this Book. The ſaid <hi>Victor,</hi> about <hi>anno,</hi> 195.
had a difference with the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia,</hi> about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of Eaſter, or <hi>Paſch;</hi> the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
a tradition from the Apoſtle of <hi>St. John,</hi> obſerved
Eaſter, according to the manner of the Jews eating their
Paſſover, and for that reaſon, were called <hi>quartadecemani.</hi>
The Churches of the Weſt obſerved it, as it is now in the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> they object here, that <hi>Victor</hi> excommunicated
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64826:162"/>
the Biſhops of the Eaſt for not obſerving Eaſter, after
the Roman and weſtern faſhion: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſay they, the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe dayes, was oecumenick Biſhop; otherwayes, he
would not have taken upon him, to exerciſe Juriſdiction in
ſo remote parts as in <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, uſurpation is no title of authority, and
by this very action of <hi>Victor,</hi> it appears, that the ſupremacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or neceſſar communion with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not believed in thoſe dayes: as appears
by two reaſons;</p>
               <p>The firſt is, the oppoſition made by the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi>
to that excommunication of <hi>Victor:</hi> but it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that they would have miſ-regarded it; if the ſupremacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or neceſſar communion with the
particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> under the pain of damnation, had
been an Article of Faith in thoſe dayes, as it is now. That
thoſe Biſhops in the Eaſt ſlighted the excommunication of
<hi>Victor,</hi> appears by <hi>Euſebius, hiſt. Eccleſ. lib. 5. cap.</hi> 23. and 24.
who relates, and brings in <hi>Polycrates,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi>
pleading their Cauſe, in an Epiſtle, written by the conſent
of them all; <hi>that they had the ſame tradition, of obſerving
Eaſter, from the Apoſtle</hi> John: <hi>that it was practiſed by</hi>
Philip <hi>the Apoſtle,</hi> Polycarpus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Smyrna, <hi>and</hi> Martyr
<hi>diſciple of</hi> John <hi>the Apoſtle; and by the other Biſhops, and</hi>
Martyrs, <hi>as</hi> Thraſeas, <hi>and</hi> Sagonius, <hi>that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
their own way, of obſerving Eaſter, in the council of all
the Biſhops of Aſia: and for thoſe reaſons, they were not moved,
with the terrors of that excommunication, pronunced againſt
them by</hi> Victor: but it is very unlike they would have
ſo contemned it, if they had believed the Supremacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> If there was any ſuch thing, as the
Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> their oppoſition demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats,
that either they were ignorant of it, or els wilfully
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64826:162"/>
oppoſed it; they could not be ignorant, for who dare affirm,
that the Apoſtles <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of <hi>John,</hi> could be ignorant of ſo neceſſar a point of
Salvation? if there had been any ſuch thing. Neither can it
be affirmed, that they wilfully oppoſed it, for it is a thing
incredible that ſo many holy men Saints and Martyrs (confeſſed
to be ſuch by the modern Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf) would die
out of the communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in ſo
doing, condemn themſelves eternally: for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>de pont. Rom. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 19. affirms, <hi>that it is not found,
that ever</hi> Victor <hi>recalled his excommunication.</hi> And ſince theſe
holy men, neither could be ignorant, that the ſupremacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was an article of Faith (if it had been
in theſe dayes) neither would they have oppoſed it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
<hi>Victors</hi> excommunication, if they had known it; it
is evinced, that in theſe dayes, there was no ſuch article of
Faith, as the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or neceſſar
communion with the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> yea, notwithſtanding
of the excommunication of <hi>Victor,</hi> the whole Churches of the
Eaſt, before the Council of <hi>Neice,</hi> obſerved Eaſter in their
own faſhion: but it were too hard to affirm, that they were
all damned; which muſt of neceſſity be affirmed, if the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> had been an article of Faith
in thoſe dayes: and this much of oppoſition from the Eaſt,
to that decree of <hi>Victor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument taken from the action of <hi>Victor,</hi>
againſt the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that it had from the Weſt; although the whole Biſhops
of the Weſt were of the ſame opinion with <hi>Victor,</hi> anent the
obſervation of Eaſter; yet they abſolutely condemned his
way of proceeding. For, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates, <hi>Hiſt. Eccleſ.
lib. 5. cap. 24. Irenaeus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> in the name of the
whole Churches of <hi>France,</hi> in an Epiſtle to the ſaid <hi>Victor,</hi>

(recorded by <hi>Euſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ebius, ibid.</hi>) expoſtulates moſt bitterly with
<hi>Victor,</hi> not obſcurely taxing him of ignorance, and arrogance,
for his precipitated proceeding, objecting to him, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of his predeceſſors, Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Pius, Teleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,
Anicetus,</hi> &amp;c. who all of them keeped communion
with the Biſhops of the Eaſt, notwithſtanding their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Eaſter, otherwayes then it was obſerved at <hi>Rome:</hi>
yea, the ſame Biſhops of the Weſt, ſtill keeped communion
with the Biſhops of the Eaſt, notwithſtanding their excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by <hi>Victor:</hi> but they would never have done ſo, if the
ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> had been believed in thoſe
dayes, or if neceſſar communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
had in thoſe times been an article of Faith.</p>
               <p>Sanderus, lib. 7. <hi>of his</hi> viſib. Monarch. <hi>and with him</hi>
Bellarmine, <hi>prove the ſupremacy of</hi> Victor <hi>in this action by a
notable cheat,</hi> the more oppoſition it had (<hi>ſaith</hi> Sanderus) the
authority of <hi>Victor</hi> was the more conſpicuous; becauſe the
Council of <hi>Neice</hi> declared in favour of <hi>Victor,</hi> againſt all his
oppoſers; in decerning that Eaſter ſhould be obſerved according
to the decree of <hi>Victor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, that the Council did ſo, not for the
authority of <hi>Victor,</hi> but only becauſe they thought that
opinion to be right: it was profeſſed by all the Churches of
the Weſt, and by <hi>Irenaeus:</hi> but <hi>Sanderus</hi> will not affirm,
that the Council of <hi>Neice</hi> followed the authority of <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>
Secondly, albeit the Council had followed the authority of
<hi>Victor,</hi> or perſwaded by his authority, had made that decree;
it doth not follow, that <hi>Victor</hi> had any juriſdiction over
the Council, or the whole Church: <hi>Paphnutius</hi> made a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Council of <hi>Neice,</hi> in the defence of married Prieſts,
the Council all followed his opinion, as <hi>Socrates</hi> relates, <hi>lib. 1.
cap.</hi> 8. of his hiſtory of the Church; and yet the ſaid <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi>
had no ſupremacy over the Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:64826:163"/>
                  <hi>Sanderus</hi> inſtances, that the Council of <hi>Neice,</hi> in a Letter
to the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (mentioned by <hi>Theodoretus</hi>)
affirms, that <hi>all the Brethren of the Eaſt are reſolved to follow
the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>us</hi> (the Council) <hi>and you of</hi> Alexandria,
<hi>in the obſervation of Eaſter:</hi> where <hi>Sanderus</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
eſpy out two things for their advantage; the firſt is, <hi>follow,</hi>
the ſecond is, that <hi>Romans</hi> is put in the firſt place before <hi>us
(the Council</hi>) whereby they prove the authority of the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> above the Council, becauſe <hi>Romans</hi> is put before
<hi>the Council, or us,</hi> and alſo becauſe the Brethren of the Eaſt
are ſaid to <hi>follow the Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, albeit <hi>Romans</hi> were put before <hi>us,</hi> or
<hi>the Council,</hi> it doth not follow, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
hath any authority over the Council: being firſt mentioned
in an Epiſtle, doth not import a juriſdiction above another:
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> in an Epiſtle (mentioned by <hi>Theodoretus, lib. 1.
cap.</hi> 10.) writing of the ſame buſineſs, enumerating a number
of Churches, with which theſe Churches of the Eaſt were
reſolved in time coming, to obſerve Eaſter; placeth
<hi>Spain</hi> before <hi>France,</hi> but it doth not follow, that the
Church of <hi>Spain</hi> had any authority over the Church of
<hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Sanderus,</hi> following the verſion
of <hi>Chriſthoferſone,</hi> tranſlates <hi>Theodoretus</hi> falſly, his words in
the Original are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
That is, <hi>So that all the Brethren of
the Eaſt, who diſſented from the Romans and you, and all thoſe
who obſerved Eaſter from the beginning, are reſolved hereafter
to obſerve it with you.</hi> The ſophiſtry of <hi>Sanderus</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
appears in this, in ſtead of theſe words, <hi>are reſolved hereafter
to obſerve Eaſter with you,</hi> which is the Original, they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,

in putting in the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Council,</hi> which
is not in the Original: which words <hi>us</hi> or <hi>the Council,</hi> they
inſert to prove the authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> above
the Council, <hi>Romans</hi> being placed by them before the <hi>Council.</hi>
And this much of that conteſt of <hi>Victor,</hi> with the Biſhops of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> which they produce to prove the ſupremacy of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereas in effect, it hath diſproved it.</p>
               <p>Such an other buſineſs as this, is that conteſt of <hi>Stephanus,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi>
about the rebaptiſing of thoſe who were baptiſed by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:
which they inſtance alſo to prove the ſupremacy of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the Council of <hi>Neice.</hi> But ſince we
ſhewed, that the excommunication of <hi>Stephanus</hi> was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gairded,
that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> praiſed the oppoſition of <hi>Cyprian</hi>
to it, and recommended theſe expreſſions of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> againſt
the uſurpation of <hi>Stephanus</hi> to the whole Church, ſince 87
Biſhops in that Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> condemned the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> ſince <hi>Cyprian,</hi> dying excommunicated,
was reputed nevertheleſs a Saint by <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

had his recourſe to <hi>Hyginus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome, anno,</hi> 142, as

(as is reported by <hi>Cyprians epiſtle,</hi> 68.) fled to <hi>Stepahnus,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

<hi>his demands at</hi> Rome <hi>are likewayes related by</hi> Epiphanius,
viz. not to take knowledge in his cauſe, in a ſecond
judgement, which is the demand of Appellants; but only to
be admitted to the communion of that Church; <hi>which are alſo
refuſed him, as is affirmed by</hi> Epiphanius.</p>
               <p>When he was rejected at <hi>Rome,</hi> he aſſociated himſelf with
one <hi>Cerdon:</hi> thoſe two hatched an opinion of <hi>three gods; the</hi>
firſt they called <hi>the good God, which created nothing at all that
is in this world;</hi> the ſecond they called <hi>a viſible god, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of all things;</hi> the third god was the <hi>devil,</hi> whom they
made <hi>as a mid-thing, between the viſible and the inviſible god.
Cerdon</hi> before he was acquainted with <hi>Marcion,</hi> aſſerted only
two gods, the one <hi>author of all good things,</hi> the other <hi>of all
evill things:</hi> but after his aquaintance with <hi>Marcion,</hi> they
both taught theſe three gods: this damnable hereſie, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
increaſed in many places; as <hi>Italy, Egypt, Paleſtine,
Arabia, Syria, Cyprus, Perſia,</hi> and other places; which
cauſed <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> inveigh ſo bitterly againſt
it in their Books.</p>
               <p>Bellarmine <hi>his ſecond inſtance of Appellations, is of</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus
<hi>and</hi> Felicisſimus, <hi>the ſtory is this;</hi> Felicisſimus <hi>and</hi>
Novatian <hi>were condemned at a Council of</hi> Carthage; Feliciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus
<hi>for averring,</hi> that thoſe who had lapſed to Idolatry, in
time of perſecution, ſhould be admitted to office of the Church,
after pen ance: Novation, <hi>for maintaining,</hi> that they might
not be admitted to communion at all, no not after pennance:
<hi>the Church of</hi> Carthage <hi>takes a midway, decerning, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:64826:165"/>
pennance they might be admitted to communion, but not
to their charge in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Felicisſimus,</hi> who had fallen in Idolatry himſelf, and for
that reaſon was debarred from his charge, conſpires with one
<hi>Privatus,</hi> who was excommunicated as well as himſelf: they
make a faction, and ſets up one <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
in opoſition to <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and immediately goes to
<hi>Rome,</hi> deſiring of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to communion with that Church, deſiring him to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
their new Biſhop <hi>Fortunatus. Cornelius</hi> refuſes at
firſt, to hear them; but afterwards they uſe Menaces; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he writes to <hi>Cyprian</hi> his intimate friend, in their favour.</p>
               <p>It is demanded of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> how he finds any Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
here? The cauſe is almoſt the ſame with that of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi>
which we now mentioned, yea, <hi>Pamelius</hi> himſelf in
his Annotations, upon that place of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> denyes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
there was any appellations, but that theſe went to
<hi>Rome,</hi> to complain, or to be judged, not in thoſe things
in which they had been already judged by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but in
other things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, albeit there had been any appellations, it was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by</hi> Cyprian, <hi>for two reaſons; firſt,</hi> becauſe delinquents
ſhould be judged where the crime is committed where witneſſes may
be had againſt them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe the authority of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
in <hi>Africa</hi> was no leſs, (who had already judged them)
then the authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom they had their
recourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers to both theſe reaſons; to the firſt
he gives a twofold anſwer, firſt, that the meaning of <hi>Cyprian</hi>
is to be underſtood <hi>de prima inſtantia,</hi> that is, perſons ſhould
be judged where the crime is committed, the firſt time only;
but if they appeal, they ſhould be judged in that place, to
which they appeal. But he Sophiſticates, for <hi>Cyprian</hi> is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64826:166"/>
oppoſing a ſecond judgement at <hi>Rome,</hi> after they had
been condemned in <hi>Carthage,</hi> as is notorious by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, Secondly, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> is againſt a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udgement or appellation, <hi>when the crime is manifeſt,
and not when it is dubious.</hi> But it is replyed, that manifeſt or
unmanifeſt crime doth not take away appellation, if the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
be otherwayes legal, or it the Judge to whom they
appeal, have juriſdiction over him, from whom they have
appealed: Neither doth <hi>Cyprian</hi> diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> between <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt</hi>
and <hi>not manifeſt crimes at all.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
contradicts himſelf, in affirming, that the meaning of <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
is that they may appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> when the cauſe is dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but not when it is manifeſt; which diſtinction <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
admits, <hi>viz.</hi> that there ſhould be no appellation when
the crime is manifeſt; and yet in this caſe of <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> and
<hi>Felix,</hi> the crimes were manifeſt: and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inſtances
their appellations as legal, which is a flat contradiction: and
this much of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> anſwer to <hi>Cyprians</hi> firſt reaſon,
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Crimes ſhould be judged where they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He yet inſtances, that if that reaſon of</hi> Cyprians <hi>were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
it would cut off all appellations,</hi> for there can be no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
if crimes be judged where they are committed, But it is
replyed, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> adds, when the authority of thoſe who
have already judged them, is no leſs then the authority of
thoſe to whom they appeal; <hi>for immediatly after thoſe words,</hi>
crimes ſhould be judged where they are committed, <hi>he reſtricts
his meaning by the compariſon of authority,</hi> except (<hi>ſaith
he</hi>) the authority of the Biſhops of <hi>Africa,</hi> be thought
not ſufficient by thoſe profligate fellows who were judged by
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:64826:166"/>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inſtances, thoſe words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the authority of the Biſhops of <hi>Africa,</hi> with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> but only, with the cauſe of
<hi>Fortunatus,</hi> and <hi>Felix:</hi> that is, the authority of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
in <hi>Africa,</hi> is ſufficient to judge that caſe: but it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
although that were the meaning of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> it cutts
off all appellations to <hi>Rome:</hi> for if the authority of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of <hi>Africa,</hi> be ſufficient in that caſe of <hi>Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi>
they cannot be rejudged at <hi>Rome,</hi> in a ſecond judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Secondly, albeit <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yprian</hi> for modeſties ſake, doth
not name the authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon:
(for he was a great reſpecter of <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi>) yet, that this is his meaning, appears more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by thoſe ſpeeches of his, uttered againſt <hi>Stephanus</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> afterward, in an other Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which we
mentioned in the former Chapter; where he expreſly affirms,
that all Biſhops, <hi>are of a like juriſdiction:</hi> And this much of
<hi>Bellarmine. Pamelius</hi> anſwers this paſſage of <hi>Cyprian</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
with a world of Sophiſtry.</p>
               <p>And firſt he affirms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in thoſe words, is not
diſputing againſt a ſecond judgement at <hi>Rome,</hi> but againſt
a judgement at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> and <hi>Felix
in prima inſtantia;</hi> and therefore he uſes theſe words, <hi>the
crime ſhould be judged where it is committed;</hi> alluding to an
Epiſtle Decretal of <hi>Fabianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which it
is expreſly ordained, <hi>that no Biſhop ſhould be judged at</hi> Rome,
<hi>per Saltum, that is, until he be firſt judged, where he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
to have tranſgreſſed.</hi> So if ye object to <hi>Pamelius,</hi> that
<hi>Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Felix,</hi> were already judged in <hi>Africa,</hi> and
went to <hi>Rome</hi> to demand a ſecond hearing: he anſwers, they
did not demand a recognoſcing of theſe things, for which they
had been already judged; but deſired of <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that he would be judge in things afterward laid to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64826:167"/>
their charge by the Biſhops of <hi>Africa,</hi> which were not yet
judged by them. But it is replyed, it is falſe, that <hi>Pamelius</hi>
affirms, for it appears expreſly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y <hi>Cyprians</hi> Letter, that he
diſputes againſt a ſecond judgment at <hi>Rome,</hi> and not a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Prima inſtantia;</hi> whereas <hi>Pamelius</hi> affirms, that new
crimes were intended, which had not been yet judged: it is
his bare aſſertion, neither brings he any proof of it; for if any
ſuch thing had been, a judgement <hi>in prima inſtantia</hi> could not
have been with any ſhadow of juſtice countenanced at <hi>Rome:</hi>
neither could <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> be ſo ignorant, as to expect any
redreſs that way; the Scope of <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> complaint was,
that he and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> might be reſtored, becauſe the
judgement of the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops paſſed againſt them was
unjuſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pamelius</hi> inſtances ſecondly, that it was a firſt judgement
or in <hi>prima inſtantia,</hi> which <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> demanded at <hi>Rome,</hi>
or elſe it was an appellation; ſeing there can be no mids,
but there is no mention made of appellation at all by <hi>Cyprian,
Ergo,</hi> it was a judgement in <hi>prima inſtantia</hi> which they
demanded at <hi>Rome;</hi> and for which <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſo much expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats
with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and inveighs againſt them.</p>
               <p>It is anſwered firſt, how this paſſage of <hi>Cyprian</hi> puzles
them, appears by their contradictions in their gloſſes: <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
inſtances this particular of <hi>Feliciſſimus,</hi> as an appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to prove the juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> over
the Biſhops in <hi>Africa: Pamelius</hi> flatly denys, that <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſimus</hi>
appealed at all; which is a flat contradiction of
<hi>Bellarmine:</hi> he takes this courſe, perceiving, that if this
particular of <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> were an appellation, <hi>Cyprian</hi> muſt of
neceſſity be againſt the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi>
ſince he expreſly diſputs, that <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> cannot be judged
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Pamelius</hi> confeſſeth, that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi>
evaſions are nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:64826:167"/>
It is anſwered, ſecondly, (whereas <hi>Pamelius</hi> diſputes
<hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> did not appeal, <hi>Ergo</hi> he demanded a judgement
<hi>in prima inſtantia</hi>) it doth not follow, becauſe there is a
mids: <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> did make no appeal, when he came out
of <hi>Africa,</hi> neither deſired he a ſecond judgment at <hi>Rome,</hi> as
it had been a formal appeal: out only deſired, the aſſiſtance
of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that by his moyen he might have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs:
that this is no <hi>evaſion,</hi> appears by two unanſwerable
reaſons; the firſt is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his 55. Epiſtle affirms, that they had ſolicited
the Biſhops in <hi>Africa,</hi> before ever they had ſolicited the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> making the ſame complaints: but none will
affirm, that they appealed to thoſe Biſhops of <hi>Africa,</hi> after
they had been condemned by the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> over
which the Biſhops of <hi>Africa</hi> had no authority; in which
doing they followed the example of <hi>Privatus,</hi> who after
he was condemned both in the Council of <hi>Africa</hi> and
at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Cornelius</hi> himſelf, yet he deſired a ſecond judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in another Council in <hi>Africa,</hi> whereby it is evident,
that a ſecond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udgement in thoſe dayes, did not infer of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
a formal appellation, ſince there could be no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
from a Synod to its ſelf: neither will <hi>Bellarmine</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that <hi>Privatus</hi> appealed from <hi>Cornelius</hi> to a Council
in <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon proving a mids between an Appeal and
a judgement in <hi>prima inſtantia,</hi> is this: we have proved, that
<hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> did not demand a judgement in <hi>prima inſtantia</hi>
from <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> but neither did he appeal unto
him for an Appealer is held <hi>Pro non judicato or not guilty,</hi> till the
appeal be diſcuſſed; but ſo was not <hi>Feliciſſimus,</hi> for all held
him guilty in <hi>Africa,</hi> and refuſed communion with him:
neither did <hi>Cornelius</hi> admitt him to his communion at <hi>Rome,</hi>
after he was condemned by the Council of <hi>Carthage:</hi> neither
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64826:168"/>
did <hi>Cornelius</hi> judge in his cauſe at all, but only wrote unto
<hi>Cyprian</hi> to deal favourably with him. Since then, <hi>Cyprian</hi>
diſputed ſo vehemently, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſhould not medle in
that caſe of <hi>Feliciſſimus,</hi> after the determination of the
Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> much more he would have oppoſed
the authority of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> if there had been any formal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation:
and all what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Pamelius</hi> alledge to
the contrary, is proved ſophiſtry, the one contradicting the
other, and this much of <hi>Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Felliciſſimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third example of Appellations (in this interval before
the Council of <hi>Neice</hi>) inſtanced by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is this, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> dying, <hi>Lucius</hi> ſucceeds; but he not liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long, <hi>Stephanus</hi> ſucceeds, in whoſe time the Biſhops of <hi>Spain</hi>
excommunicat <hi>Baſilides</hi> a Biſhop, and likewayes one <hi>Martialis,</hi>
for falling in Idolatry, or ſacrificing to Idols, in the time of
perſecution, for fear of torture, or death: <hi>Baſilides</hi> becomes
penitent, demands abſolution, which they grant him; but
withal, they refuſe to reſtore him to his Biſhoprick, in which
they put another called <hi>Sabinus. Baſilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis</hi> have
their recourſe to <hi>Stephanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> he takes not ſo
much notice of <hi>Martialis,</hi> but he writes to the Biſhops of <hi>Spain</hi>
to reſtore <hi>Baſilides</hi> to his place: they conſult the Biſhops of
<hi>Africa,</hi> who meeting in a Council about the buſineſs, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of <hi>Africa</hi> ſend their opinion in an Epiſtle (which in the
edition of <hi>Turnebius</hi> is <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 35. in that of <hi>Pamelius,</hi> 68. of
<hi>Cyprian</hi>) in which Epiſtle, <hi>Cyprian</hi> inveighs againſt <hi>Baſilides</hi>
as an Impoſtor, taxeth <hi>Stephanus</hi> of credulity, in giving ear to
<hi>Baſilides,</hi> and concludes, that the ceſire of <hi>Stephanus</hi> ſhould
not be obeyed, ſince <hi>Sabinus was legally put in the place of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilides,
<hi>and therefore they ought to maintain him in that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is demanded, what he ſees in this <hi>Hiſtory</hi>
making for the juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64826:168"/>
Biſhops of <hi>Spain?</hi> or for proving that <hi>Baſilides</hi> appealed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally?
It would ſeem, that <hi>Baſilides</hi> appealed not, ſince he
was held <hi>pro judicato<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> excommunicated, depoſed,</hi> and another put
in his Biſhoprick; which could not have been done, if Appeals
to <hi>Rome</hi> had been believed obligatory in thoſe dayes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Council of <hi>Africa</hi> adviſe the Biſhops
of <hi>Spain,</hi> not to obey the deſire of <hi>Stephanus</hi> in reſcinding the
ordination of <hi>Sabinus,</hi> affirmed by them to be legal (<hi>Jure
ordinata</hi>) but if <hi>Baſilides</hi> had appealed, the ordination of
<hi>Sabinus</hi> had not been lawful; whereby it is evident, that no
appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> were approved in thoſe dayes, albeit <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilides</hi>
had appealed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, that <hi>Baſilides</hi> did appeal, becauſe he had
his recourſe to <hi>Stephanus,</hi> and complained: But it is replyed,
firſt, that was no appeal, becauſe he made no intimation of
it to the Biſhops of <hi>Spain,</hi> before he went to <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly,
becauſe his going to <hi>Rome,</hi> did not hinder or ſuſpend the
execution of the ſentence paſſed againſt him, as appears by the
placing of <hi>Sabinus</hi> in his Biſhoprick in the <hi>interim.</hi> Thirdly,
when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he brought no probations with him,
but only as <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirms, <hi>Stephanum longe poſitum &amp; rei
geſtae ignarum fefellit;</hi> that is, <hi>he deceived</hi> Stephanus <hi>Biſhop
of</hi> Rome, <hi>altogether ignorant of the buſineſs.</hi> Laſtly, if <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides</hi>
had appealed, the Biſhops of <hi>Spain</hi> had been cited to
plead the cauſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> which they were not, whereby it is
evident there was no appeal.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to prove the Juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,
Bellarmine</hi> alledgeth, that <hi>Stephanus</hi> commanded the Biſhops
of <hi>Spain</hi> to repone <hi>Baſilides,</hi> and reſcind that ordination they
had made in favour of <hi>Sabinus.</hi> But it is anſwered (to omit, we
ſhewed it was no formal ſentence of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> but only an
advice) <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

the Biſhops of <hi>Spain</hi> (before they gave an anſwer to <hi>Stephanus</hi>)
conſulted with the Biſhops of <hi>Africa,</hi> whereby it is evident,
they acknowledged not the juriſdiction of the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly, the Biſhops of <hi>Africa,</hi> meeting in a
Council, adviſes them not to obey the deſire of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> in
reſcinding their ordination of <hi>Sabinus,</hi> becauſe it was <hi>Rite
peracta, or legal,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Stephanus</hi> had no authority

did not obey the deſire of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> at leaſt it is not found
in any monument of Antiquity, that ever <hi>Baſilides</hi> was
reſtored.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inſtances, that <hi>Stephanus</hi> would never have
taken it upon him, to cognoſce in the cauſe of <hi>Baſilides,</hi> if it
had not belonged to him: But it is anſwered, firſt, he did
not cognoſce formally in it at all, as we ſhewed. Secondly,
albeit he had, it was only an uſurpation, which is no title
of the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> We do not affirm
that <hi>Stephanus</hi> had not ſo much arrogancy, ſince he declared
he had, as appears by his proceeding with the Churches of
<hi>Africa,</hi> mentioned in the former Chapter: we only affirm, that
he did not cognoſce formally in this caſe of <hi>Baſilides,</hi> but
only delt by way of perſwaſion: and although he had done
ſo, it is no Argument for the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as an Article of Faith in thoſe dayes; ſince it was every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
oppoſed, as we proved by that paſſage of <hi>Victor,</hi> with the
oriental Biſhops, and of <hi>Stephanus</hi> with <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and this of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus</hi>
with the Biſhops of <hi>Spain:</hi> by which paſſages it appears,
that the decrees of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> were oppoſed in all the
Eaſt, in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> that is, almoſt by the
whole Church. And this much of appellations to <hi>Rome,</hi>
before the dayes of <hi>Cyprian.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XI. The teſtimonies of Ignatius, Irenaeus and Tertullian, object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to prove the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of Rome, before
the times of Cyprian, examined.</head>
               <p>IN the two former Chapters, we anſwered all what the
Learned Romaniſts could pretend, to prove the ſupremacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the midle of the third Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
by uſurpations of Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and appellations:
They next endeavour to prove it by teſtimonies of Fathers,
which are of two ſorts; 1. <hi>wreſted; 2. forged.</hi> In this
Chapter and the next following, we will examine the firſt
ſort; and then we will conclude this Book, with examining
the laſt. The Fathers, whoſe teſtimonies they wreſt, are
either Greek, or Latin: The Greek Fathers are <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
and <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> the Latin Fathers, by them alledged are,
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian:</hi> We will ſpeak of the Greek Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and alſo of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in this Chapter, and will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
theſe teſtimonies of <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the Chapter next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
And firſt of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> from whom they alledge the
inſcription of his Epiſtle written to the Romans, which
is this, <hi>Ignatius to the Sanctified Church preſiding in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Romans;</hi> thus the place is alledged by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
whereas the Greek hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
that is, <hi>which preſides in the place of the region of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi>
wherefore they render it ſo? this is the reaſon; <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius
ad annum. 45. num.</hi> 10. obſerves, that the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> and the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> were believed to be the
ſame; and therefore, they tranſlate <hi>Ignatius,</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Church of <hi>Rome, to Preſide in the region of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
that is (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Bozius) Preſiding in the
Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:64826:171"/>
But it is anſwered, firſt, that it was not the cuſtom, in
the dayes of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to call the <hi>Roman-church,</hi> the <hi>Catholick-church:</hi>
or where they ſpake of the <hi>Roman-church,</hi> to mean
by it the <hi>Catholick-church:</hi> firſt, becauſe the oldeſt teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
we have of that kind, is in the dayes of <hi>Theodoſius junior,
Victor Uticenſis,</hi> and <hi>Gregorius Turonenſis:</hi> that is, not till 300.
years after <hi>Ignatius;</hi> and 400. after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, that
maner of phraſe had its Original from the <hi>Arians;</hi> the ſaid
<hi>Gregorius Turonenſis,</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Gloria martyrum,
cap.</hi> 25. brings in an <hi>Arian Prince,</hi> calling the <hi>Orthodox-church,
the Roman-church:</hi> or <hi>Orthodox-chriſtians, Romans.</hi>
Thirdly, that maner of ſpeaking had its Original, from a
politick reaſon; and not from an Eccleſiaſtical: In thoſe
dayes the <hi>Goths, Alans,</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> made war upon the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;
the firſt three were <hi>Arians,</hi> the Romans <hi>Orthodox:</hi>
and therefore, becauſe all the Orthodox Chriſtians partied
the Romans in that war, they called them all <hi>Romans;</hi> their
<hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Roman Faith;</hi> their Church the <hi>Roman Church:</hi>
as the <hi>Turks</hi> at this day, call all Chriſtians <hi>Francks,</hi> or
<hi>French-men.</hi> Fourthly, as we ſaid, they tranſlate <hi>Ignatius</hi>
falſly; for his words are, <hi>to the Church preſiding in Loco,
regionis Romanorum, in the place of the region of the Romans:</hi>
whereby it evidently appears, that the meaning of <hi>Ignatius</hi> is
no other, then the <hi>Church preſiding in the Town of</hi> Rome;
ſince none can affirm by theſe words, he means otherwayes,
or that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> preſides in the whole Church;
ſince he particularizes the preſidency, and reſtricts it to a
certain-place, <hi>of the region of the Romans:</hi> and therefore,
they ſophiſticate egregiouſly, in tranſlating <hi>Ignatius, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding
in the region of the Romans.</hi> Since the Romans (ſay
they) at that time commanded the whole world, <hi>Ignatius</hi>
by a Church <hi>Preſiding in the region of the Romans,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
a Church <hi>Preſiding in the whole world:</hi> whereas the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64826:171"/>
words of <hi>Ignatus</hi> impart no more, but a Church preſiding <hi>in
a certain place, of the region of the Romans,</hi> Which is further
confirmed, becauſe we ſhewed before, from theſe two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles
of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to the <hi>Trallians,</hi> and <hi>Magneſians,</hi> that he
acknowledged no Office in the Church, above that of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop:
but he could not be ſo forgetful of himſelf, as in this
Epiſtle, to acknowledge the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Bozius</hi> pretends he doth; which is
further confirmed, by the teſtimony of <hi>Baſilius</hi> Epiſts 8.
where he affirms, that <hi>Iconium preſides in a part of Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
which is juſt ſuch an other expreſſion as that of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We could defend the meaning of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> not to make
much for them, although they had tranſlated him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
that is, if he had ſaid <hi>Preſiding in the region of the
Romans:</hi> for, from theſe words it can no more be gathered,
that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is oecumenick Biſhop, then it can
prove the Biſhop of <hi>Ments,</hi> or the Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick
Biſhop; becauſe they <hi>preſide in the region of
Carthage,</hi> &amp;c. for in the dayes of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as we ſaid, none
were called <hi>Romans,</hi> but thoſe who lived within the precinct,
or particular command of the City: and this much of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now followeth</hi> Irenaeus, <hi>from whom they bring a teſtimony
by them much magnified; the paſſage is this, ſpeaking of the
Church of</hi> Rome, ad hanc enim eccleſiam, propter potentiorem
principalitatem, neceſſe eſt omnem convenire eccleſiam, hoc
eſt eos qui ſunt undique, fideles, in qua Semper ab his qui
Sunt undique conſervata eſt ea, quae ab Apoſtolis eſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio.
<hi>The ſubſtance is,</hi> all Churches ſhould accord with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for two reaſons, firſt, becauſe of its more
powerful principality; the next is, becauſe Apoſtolical tradition
is preſerved in that Church. <hi>But this place makes not much
for them, as appears by</hi> Irenaeus <hi>ſcope; this paſſage is found,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:64826:172"/>
lib. 3. cap. 13. <hi>in which Chapter he is diſputing againſt</hi>
Hereticks; <hi>which were the perfect Scriptures? he willeth
them for their ſatisfaction, to conſult with the ancient
Churches, which ſucceſſively deſcended from the Apoſtles:
and for inſtance ſake, proponeth unto them the</hi> Church of
Rome; <hi>his meaning is then, in thoſe words,</hi> whatever the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time thought perfect Scriptures, all
Churches about were bound to acknowledge them for ſuch; <hi>firſt,
by reaſon of its more</hi> powerful principality, <hi>that Church being
founded by the Apoſtles</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Peter (<hi>as was believed then)
Secondly, becauſe it hath been thought by Churches about</hi>
to have purely preſerved that tradition of the Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which it had received from the Apoſtles: <hi>ſo that the
meaning of</hi> Irenaeus <hi>is no other then this,</hi> that all are bound
to accord to that Church, ſo long as it preſerves the perfect
Canon of Scripture, and teaches no other Doctrine then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it, <hi>by this teſtimony of</hi> Irenaeus, <hi>we are bound no
more to adhere to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>then it adhereth to
the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they inſtance, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſimply, without ſuch reſtrictions,
<hi>affirms, that all ſhould accord to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>becauſe it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the apoſtolick tradition;</hi> which is as much, ſay they, as the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot make an Apoſtacy. But it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
firſt, although <hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirmed, that in thoſe times,
<hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>preſerved the pure Canon of the Scripture;</hi>
yet, he doth not affirm, that in all times coming it would
do ſo. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day, obſerves not that
Cannon of the Scripture, which was obſerved in the dayes
of <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> under the pain of an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi>
adds to the Canon of the Scriptures, theſe Books com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> which were rejected by the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as ſhall be proved in its
own place, by the teſtimonies of the moſt eminent Doctors
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64826:172"/>
of the Roman Church; to omit the teſtimonies of almoſt
all the Fathers, by whoſe teſtimonies it ſhall be proved, that
in the dayes of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the Churches of <hi>Rome, Aſia, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,
Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. rejected thoſe Books canonized by the
Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> and therefore, they muſt of neceſſity
affirm, that either the Modern Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent,</hi> excommunicates all theſe, who accord with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Canon of the Scripture, in the
dayes of <hi>Irenaeus:</hi> or elſe they have made a defection them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
from that Church, which was in the dayes of <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi>
The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> makes thoſe Books Canonical,
with an <hi>Anathema</hi> to thoſe who ſhall not acknowledge them
for ſuch, but the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
rejected them as <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> as is proved by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of <hi>Ruffinus in Symbulo apud Cyprianum, and Hieronymus
in his preface upon the Books of the Kings,</hi> and <hi>prologo Galeato,
tom.</hi> 3. That all other Churches accorded with the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that Canon of the Scriptures, is proved by an
induction of them all: as the eaſt Church, as is teſtified by
<hi>Melito,</hi> the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> as is teſtified by <hi>Cyril,</hi>
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> witneſſe <hi>Athanas</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> of <hi>France;</hi>
as is teſtified by <hi>Hilarius,</hi> of <hi>Aſia, Concil. Loadicenum,</hi>
of <hi>Conſtantinople; Nazianz,</hi> and <hi>Damaſcen.</hi> Theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
are acknowledged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf for the moſt
part, <hi>lib. 1. cap. 20. de verbo Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in theſe words, means no other
<hi>according with the Church of</hi> Rome, then in as far as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the truth, appears further, not only by his keeping
communion with the Biſhops of the Eaſt, notwithſtanding
of their excommunication by <hi>Victor;</hi> but likewayes by his
ſharply rebuking of <hi>Victor,</hi> taxing him of Ignorance, and
Arrogance, for his proceeding in ſuch a manner: by which
it evidently appears, that necceſſar communion with the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64826:173"/>
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was no article of faith in the opinion of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
much leſs the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and this much
of <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we come to the Latine Fathers; the firſt paſſage al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
is of <hi>Tertullianus de pudicitia,</hi> where he calls <hi>Victor</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Biſhop of Biſhops:</hi> But it is anſwered, firſt,
albeit he did ſo, it proves not <hi>Victor</hi> was oecumenick Biſhop;
becauſe we read that <hi>James</hi> is ſo called by <hi>Clement, Lupus</hi>
is ſo called by <hi>Sidonius, lib. 6. epiſt. 1. Marcus</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> is called alſo <hi>Biſhop of Biſhops,</hi> by <hi>Theodorus Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamon,</hi>
in his anſwers to the Interrogations of the ſaid <hi>Marcus:</hi>
but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not affirm, that <hi>James,</hi> or <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pus,</hi> or
<hi>Marcus</hi> were oecumenick Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Tertullian</hi> in that place; calling <hi>Victor Biſhop of
Biſhops,</hi> doth ſo <hi>Ironicè</hi> or in <hi>mockery,</hi> as appeares by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of his calling him ſo, which was this: <hi>Victor</hi> made
a decree of admitting fornicators or whoremongers too eaſily
to the communion of the Church, in the opinion of <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
Speaking of that decree, <hi>Tertullian</hi> affirms, <hi>Epiſcopus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcoporum
nuper edidit Edictum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Biſhop of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
hath now put forth an Edict,</hi> and falls too immediatly and
diſputes againſt it: whereby it appears, that he did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the ſupremacy of <hi>Victor:</hi> that he is mocking
him, appears further, by his calling that decree of <hi>Victor,
Edictum,</hi> an <hi>edict,</hi> but Emperours only ſet forth <hi>Edicts,</hi>
and ſo he calls <hi>Victor Biſhop of Biſhops,</hi> in the ſame ſence
that he calls <hi>his decree an Edict,</hi> which none can deny
to be in mockery.</p>
               <p>They alledge another paſſage from <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.</hi>
76. againſt hereticks; this paſſage is objected by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius,</hi>
and is this, <hi>If ye live in the adjacent places to</hi> Italy,
<hi>ye have</hi> Rome, <hi>from whence we have alſo Authority. Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
himſelf then lived in <hi>Africa,</hi> whence they conclude
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64826:173"/>
from theſe words <hi>we have Authority,</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
had Juriſdiction in <hi>Africa</hi> in the opinion <hi>Tertullian.</hi> But it
is anſwered, this place reſembles very much that of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
which we now diſcuſſed; his ſcope in theſe words, is to arme
his Readers againſt hereſies; among other preſcriptions, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribs
this fore one, that all ſhould ſtrive to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
what is the Doctrine of thoſe Churches which were
founded by the Apoſtles, and then to conform themſelves
to that Doctrine. And firſt, ſaith he, <hi>If ye live in</hi> Achaia
<hi>conſult the Church of</hi> Corinth; <hi>if ye live not far from</hi>
Macedonia, <hi>conſult the Church of</hi> Philippi, <hi>and</hi> Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica;
<hi>if ye live in</hi> Aſia, <hi>conſult the Church of</hi> Epheſus;
<hi>if ye live in the adjacent parts to</hi> Italy, <hi>follow the Church
of</hi> Rome; <hi>from which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we alſo in</hi> Africa <hi>have
our authority,</hi> becauſe it is the neareſt Apoſtolick Church.
Obſerve, he calls <hi>Apoſtolick Churches</hi> thoſe who were
founded by the Apoſtles themſelves, as that of <hi>Philippi,
Corinth, Theſſalonica</hi> by <hi>Paul,</hi> that of <hi>Epheſus</hi> by <hi>St.
John,</hi> that of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul:</hi> whence it is
eaſie to conjecture, what is the meaning of <hi>Tertullian:</hi>
for by theſe words, <hi>from whence we have our Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
it follows no more, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath
juriſdiction in <hi>Africa,</hi> then it follows, that the Church
of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or <hi>Antiochia</hi> have juriſdiction over all <hi>Aſia;</hi>
or, that the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> hath juriſdiction over all
<hi>Achaia.</hi> His meaning then aſſuredly is, that albeit one
be not under the juriſdiction of the neareſt Apoſtolick
Church; yet it is the ſureſt way, to preſerve your ſelf
from Hereſie, to follow the Faith of that Church, becauſe
it is moſt like, that thoſe Churches, who were founded
by the Apoſtles themſelves, are leaſt obnoxious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:64826:174"/>
Secondly, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> did not dream of any ſuch thing
as the infalibity of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſupremacy of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a neceſſar article of faith, appears, not
only by his diſputing expreſly againſt that decree of <hi>Victor,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which we now mentioned; but alſo, by
ſeveral other paſſages of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in the ſaid preſcriptions,
and elſe where. <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> in his Argument to the ſame
book of <hi>Tertullian, de preſcrip,</hi> printed at <hi>Baſil, anno.</hi> 1521.
(which <hi>Rhenanus</hi> was a Popiſh Doctor, and exquiſitly verſed
in the Writings of the Fathers, and eſpecially of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
upon whom he commented) hath theſe expreſſions;
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth not confine the Chatholick Church to
the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>he doth not eſteem ſo highly of the
Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>as they do now a dayes; he reckoneth her
with other Churches, and admoniſheth his Reader to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
as well what milk the Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>gave, as that of</hi>
Rome: In which words, he means the ſame very paſſage of
<hi>Tertullian</hi> which we now explained, and vindicated from the
Sophiſtry of <hi>Pamelius:</hi> at laſt he concludes, <hi>if</hi> Tertullian
<hi>were now alive, and ſhould ſay ſo much, he could not eſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed;</hi>
and this much <hi>Rhenanus</hi> avouched, when he had
the uſe of his tongue: but the <hi>index, expurgatorius belgicus,
pag.</hi> 78. has gagged his mouth with a <hi>deleantur hec verba,</hi> and
ſo they are not now found in the Editions of <hi>Rhenanus,</hi> printed
ſince in thoſe places, where the Pope hath juriſdiction.
They had reaſon to purge out thoſe words from <hi>Rhenanus,</hi>
becauſe the teſtimony of his was as a Poyniard, ſticking in the
very bowels of that article of the Catechiſe of the Council
of <hi>Trent,</hi> viz. <hi>that there is no ſalvation without communion
with the Church of</hi> Rome</p>

               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, this reaſoning is very unbeſeeming
ſuch a learned man as <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> for the meaning of <hi>Cyprian</hi>
is no other, then that the Novatians ſet up to themſelves a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64826:175"/>
Biſhop at <hi>Rome,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Cornelius;</hi> ſo he calls the
Novatian Biſhop, <hi>an adulterous head, contrary to</hi> Cornelius,
who was the true head of the particular Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was the true Biſhop thereof: and ſo <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth
not mean any <hi>head of the whole Church,</hi> but only by <hi>Head,</hi>
he means Biſhop of the particular Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bellarmine <hi>inſtances, that</hi> Cyprian <hi>affirms,</hi> his intention
was to reconcile thoſe Shiſmaticks to the Catholick Church; by
which he means the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſince the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Catholick Church, and the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
head of the Church of <hi>Rome, Ergo,</hi> he is head of the Catholick
Church.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered when <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> his meaning is a <hi>particular
Church profeſſing the Doctrine of the Catholick Church;</hi>
and therefore, they who were reconciled to the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> were reconciled to the Catholick Church alſo: ſo
any reconciled to a particular Church, profeſſing the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of the Catholick Church, is reconciled alſo to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, and yet that particular Church is not the <hi>Catholick
Church.</hi> That this is the meaning of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> appears, by the
preceeding Epiſtle, or <hi>epiſt.</hi> 41. where ſpeaking of ſome Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
in the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> he affirms they oppoſed
themſelves to the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> he means, they oppoſed
themſelves to the Church of <hi>Cathage,</hi> inwhich doing, they
oppoſed themſelves to the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> becauſe the
Church of <hi>Cathage,</hi> profeſſed the ſame Doctrine, with the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in oppoſing or renting the Church of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> they rent and oppoſed the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pamelius,</hi> urgeth, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirms, that thoſe
Schiſmaticks refuſed the boſome of the <hi>root and mother
Church:</hi> where obſerve, ſaith he, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64826:175"/>
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>root and the mother of all Churches, or
of the Catholick Church,</hi> which Epithet is given by <hi>Cyprian</hi>
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only in this epiſtle, but alſo in
his 45. <hi>epiſt</hi> to <hi>Cornelius:</hi> in which he gives injunctions to
thoſe he was ſending to <hi>Rome,</hi> (to be informed concerning
that ſchiſm of the <hi>Novatians</hi>) that they ſhould acknowledge
and adhere to the <hi>Root and Mother of the Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> by <hi>Root and Mother of
the Catholick Church,</hi> means no other thing, but the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Church
it ſelf,</hi> as appears by the ſaid 45. Epiſtle; in
which he affirms to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that hearing that there was
a ſchiſm in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſent <hi>Caldonius</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi>
to be informed of the truth of the buſineſs, and to
adhere to neither party, till they were informed which of the
factions was in the right? and which in the wrong? and for
that reaſon, he did not direct his Letters, either to <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
or to that <hi>Novatian Biſhop;</hi> but only to the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> and
<hi>Deacons</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that being informed by them, they might
adhere to thoſe, who held and acknowledged the <hi>Root and
Mother of the Catholick Church:</hi> whereby it is evident, that
<hi>Cyprian</hi> did not believe, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or
thoſe who adhered to him, were the <hi>root and mother of the
Catholick Church,</hi> ſince he gave his meſſengers injunction, to
ſuſpend their Judgments, till they were informed, who adhered
to the <hi>root and mother of the Catholick Church,</hi> that is, who
maintained the true Faith, or who were members of the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> for if <hi>Cyprian</hi> had believed, that <hi>Cornelius</hi>
and his faction, had been <hi>the root and mother of the Catholick
Church,</hi> he would not have injoyned his meſſengers to ſuſpend
their judgment, till they were informed by the Presbyters
and Deacons: ſo it is evident, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> by <hi>Root and
Mother of the Catholick Church,</hi> means the <hi>Catholick Church
it ſelf,</hi> both in his 45. and 42. Epiſtle; and in the ſame ſenſe,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64826:176"/>
                  <hi>epiſt.</hi> 43. and 44. he exhorts them to return to their
<hi>mother,</hi> that is, to the unity of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond paſſage of <hi>Cyprian</hi> is found in his 55. Epiſtle,
where he hath theſe words, <hi>That the occaſion of Hereſies and
Schiſmes in the Church is only this, that the Prieſt of God is not
obeyed, and that it is not believed, that one Prieſt, as Judge in
place of Chriſt for a time, is in the Church.</hi> This place is
much urged by <hi>Pamelius,</hi> in his Annotations upon the ſaid
Epiſtle, to prove an <hi>oecumenick</hi> Biſhop.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, <hi>Cyprian</hi> in this Letter or Epiſtle, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing
againſt thoſe, who had ſet up one <hi>Fortunatus</hi> (as we
ſhewed before) Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in oppoſition to himſelf:
and his meaning is not, that there ſhould be <hi>one Biſhop</hi> in the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but only <hi>one Biſhop</hi> in a <hi>particular Church,</hi>
or the <hi>Church of Carthage:</hi> becauſe two Biſhops, in
one place, occaſions Schiſmes, and Hereſies, ſaith <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian:</hi>
ſo its evident, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> is pleading his own
cauſe, diſputing againſt thoſe who had ſet up a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Biſhop, in the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in oppoſition to
himſelf, and then went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and calumniated him to
<hi>Cornelius:</hi> it had been impertinent in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to bring in mention of an <hi>oecumenick Biſhop;</hi> the whole
diſpute of <hi>Cyprian</hi> conſiſts in theſe two Sylogiſmes, the firſt
is, <hi>who riſe up in oppoſition to their lawful Biſhop; will aſſuredly
be puniſhed by God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe men, <hi>Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Feliciſſimus,</hi> riſe up againſt
their lawful Biſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> God will aſſuredly puniſh them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond Sylogiſme is this,</hi> who are the occa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
and Schiſmes, will be puniſhed:</p>
               <p>But who riſe againſt their lawful Biſhop, are the occaſion of
Hereſies, and Schiſmes.</p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:64826:176"/>
By which diſputations of <hi>Cyprians,</hi> it is evident, that by
<hi>one Biſhop</hi> he doth not mean an <hi>oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> but any
Biſhop of a particular charge; becauſe if by one Biſhop he had
meaned, an <hi>oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> the minor of his firſt Sylogiſme
is notoriouſly falſe: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or, <hi>Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Feliciſſimus,</hi> did
not riſe up againſt an oecumenick Biſhop, but only againſt <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Pamelius</hi> inſtances, firſt, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> cites ſeveral
teſtimonies of Scripture, in this diſpute, which did quadrate
only to the <hi>high Prieſt</hi> of the Jewes: And therefore, thoſe
words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> are more fitly to be underſtood of an <hi>oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Biſhop.</hi> But it is anſwered, <hi>Pamelius</hi> playes the Sophiſter
three wayes: Firſt, it is falſe, that theſe paſſages cited by
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> are only applyable to the <hi>high Prieſt of the Jewes;</hi>
firſt, he cites thoſe words of <hi>Moſes, Deutr. 17. what ever
man, who out of Pride, ſhall not hearken to the Prieſt and
Judge who ſhall be in thoſe dayes, that man ſhall die.</hi> But
that <hi>Moſes</hi> is not ſpeaking here of the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> but
of any Prieſt, a very child may perceive, who reads that
Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> or the 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. verſes
of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Pamelius</hi> Sophiſticates, in omitting thoſe
paſſages cited by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which cannot be applyed to
the High Prieſt onely: as that of <hi>Matth. 8. 4. Go ſhew thy
ſelf unto the Prieſts,</hi> and that of <hi>Luke, 10. 16. he that
heareth you heareth me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Pamelius</hi> Sophiſticates egregiouſly, in conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Cyprian</hi> to mean in thoſe words, an oecumenick Biſhop,
by reaſon of his citation of thoſe teſtimonies of <hi>Scripture:</hi> for
<hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Rogatianus,</hi> and in another Epiſtle to
<hi>Florentius,</hi> cites all thoſe very places, which he cites in this 55.
Epiſtle to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to prove that none ſhould oppoſe their
Biſhop: But <hi>Pamelius</hi> himſelf, in his Annotations upon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64826:177"/>
both thoſe Epiſtles, confeſſeth, that neither in the one
nor the other, <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks of an <hi>oecumenick Biſhop:</hi> in
the one, he ſpeaks of <hi>Rogatianus,</hi> in the other, he ſpeaks
of himſelf, as he doth in this 55. Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pamelius</hi> objects, Secondly, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> here ſpeaks
of <hi>a Biſhop who is Judge in place of Chriſt.</hi> But it is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Cyprian</hi> in thoſe words, means not an <hi>oecumenick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi>
but any Biſhop whatſoever, as is evident, by theſe
following reaſons: Firſt, he gives Colleagues to that Biſhop
whom he affirmeth <hi>to be Judge in place of Chriſt,</hi> and that in
the ſame Epiſtle, his words are, <hi>no man after divine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuffrages of the people, conſent of his fellow Biſhops,
would make himſelf Judge, not now of his Biſhop, but of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, becauſe</hi> epiſt. 69. <hi>to</hi> Florentius, Cyprian <hi>calls
himſelf a</hi> judge conſtitute by God for a time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is no marvel, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls any Biſhop,
<hi>judge in place of Chriſt,</hi> ſince <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epiſtle to the
<hi>Trallians,</hi> gives the ſame Eipthet to <hi>Deacons:</hi> he exhorts the
ſaid <hi>Trallians, to reverence their Deacons as Chriſt, whoſe place
they hold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pamelius</hi> objects, thirdly, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirms, that the
cauſe of ſchiſme and hereſies is, that <hi>one Biſhop is not conſtitute
in the Church,</hi> and affirms that <hi>Cyprian</hi> by <hi>one Biſhop</hi> ever
means <hi>oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> as appears by his <hi>epiſt.</hi> 48. to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi>
and by his Book <hi>de unitate eccleſiae:</hi> But it is anſwered,
that it is falſe, which <hi>Pamelius</hi> affirms, for in thoſe places
mentioned by him, there is no ſuch thing to be found in
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> that <hi>by one Biſhop he means an oecumenick Biſhop.</hi>
Secondly, it is falſe which he affirms, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in every
place by <hi>one Biſhop,</hi> means an oecumenick Biſhop; for in his
Epiſtle to <hi>Pupianus,</hi> he hath theſe very words which he hath
in this 55. Epiſtle, <hi>viz.</hi> that the cauſe of Hereſies and Schiſms
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64826:177"/>
is, that <hi>one Biſhop preſiding in the Church, is contemned by the
proud preſumption of ſome:</hi> and yet <hi>Pamelius</hi> himſelf, in his
Annotations upon the place, confeſſeth, that <hi>Cyprian by one
Biſhop means any Biſhop whatſoever, and not an oecumenick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pamelius</hi> objects fourthly, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his 55. Epiſtle,
cannot mean <hi>himſelf alone,</hi> becauſe he affirms, <hi>if that one
Biſhop were acknowledged, no man would move any thing againſt
the Colledge of Prieſts;</hi> becauſe it doth not follow, that
they who move any thing againſt <hi>Cyprian,</hi> oppoſe all other
Biſhops: But it is anſwered, <hi>Cyprian</hi> meaning is, that in
oppoſing himſelf, <hi>they oppoſed the Colledge of Biſhops which
had ordained him Biſhop of</hi> Carthage: as is evident likewayes,
by the next following words, which we cited before, <hi>viz.
no man can make himſelf judge of his Biſhop, after the ſuffrages
of the people, and the conſent of his fellow Biſhops:</hi> whereby
it is evident, that the meaning of <hi>Cyprian</hi> is, that who
oppoſed him, oppoſed the Colledge of Biſhops, who had
ordained him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Pamelius</hi> objects, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> after thoſe words
of <hi>one Biſhop,</hi> makes mention <hi>de ſervo praepoſito, or a ſervant
preferred,</hi> or ſet over the reſt, and immediately after he makes
mention of <hi>Peter.</hi> But it is anſwered none, can underſtand
wherein the force of this objection conſiſts; for <hi>Cyprian</hi> after
he had affirmed, <hi>that it was no marvel they had deſerted that one
ſervant who was preferred to the reſt, ſince the Diſciples left
Chriſt himſelf: and then our Saviour asked the Apoſtles, if they
would alſo leave him?</hi> then <hi>Peter</hi> (upon whom the Church was
built by our Lord) <hi>anſwered for them all, Lord, whether or
to whom ſhall we go?</hi> Whereas <hi>Pamelius</hi> urgeth, that by <hi>ſervus
praepoſitus</hi> is meaned <hi>Peter,</hi> it can be no wayes gathered out of
the words of <hi>Cypria;</hi> his ſcope in thoſe words is only to
ſhew, that it was no marvel that thoſe Schiſmaticks abandoned
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64826:178"/>
him their Biſhop, <hi>who was that ſervant ſet over them, ſince
Chriſts diſciples abandoned him.</hi> That <hi>Peter</hi> was only that
<hi>ſervus praepoſitus,</hi> cannot be gathered out of the words of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian:</hi>
for, that the Church was built upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and that
<hi>Peter</hi> anſwered in the name of the Church, it makes nothing
for the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter,</hi> as we proved before by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelf; who in his books <hi>de unitate eccleſiae</hi>
affirms, <hi>whatever</hi> Peter <hi>was, the other Apoſtles were the ſame,</hi>
equal to him in dignity and power: However, that <hi>building of the
Cchurch upon</hi> Peter, hath nothing ado with that <hi>ſervus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitus</hi>
mentioned by <hi>Cyprian;</hi> for as we ſaid, <hi>Cyprian</hi> means
only <hi>any Biſhop,</hi> and in particular himſelf by that <hi>Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Horantius, loc. chathol. lib. 6. cap. 10. <hi>and</hi> Harding, <hi>diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt</hi> Jewel, art. 4. <hi>brings another objection, that</hi>
Cyprian by one Biſhop <hi>means not himſelf, or any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Biſhop, but oecumenick: their objection is founded
upon the words of</hi> Cyprian, <hi>who after he had affirmed,</hi> that
the cauſe of Schiſmes was, that one Biſhop was not acknowledged
Judge in place of Chriſt in the Church; <hi>he adds,</hi> if according
to divine precepts, the whole fraternity were obedient to the
ſaid Judge, no man would move any thing againſt the Colledge
of Prieſts; <hi>whence</hi> Horantius <hi>and</hi> Harding <hi>concludes, that
by</hi> whole fraternity Cyprian <hi>means the</hi> whole Church, <hi>and by</hi>
one Biſhop one viſible head of that Church.</p>
               <p>But it is anſwered, that <hi>Cyprian, by whole fraternity, means
that multitude of which any particular Church is compoſed:</hi> as
in his 68. Epiſtle, writing to the Biſhops of <hi>Spain, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
them not to reſcind the ordination of</hi> Sabinus, <hi>whom they
had placed in the Biſhoprick of</hi> Baſilides, he affirms, that
the ſaid <hi>Sabinus</hi> was choſen, by the ſuffrages <hi>of the whole
fraternity:</hi> But <hi>Horantius</hi> and <hi>Harding</hi> will not affirm, that
<hi>Cyprian</hi> in this 68. Epiſtle, means <hi>the univerſal Church, or
church of</hi> Rome <hi>by whole fraternity;</hi> ſince it is evident by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64826:178"/>
the circumſtances, that he means <hi>a particular Church, or that
Congregation which chuſed</hi> Sabinus <hi>for their Biſhop.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
as we ſhewed before, the ſaid <hi>Sabinus</hi> was placed
Biſhop, and maintained in his Biſhoprick over the belly of
<hi>Stephanus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> who deſired them to reſtore
<hi>Baſilides;</hi> and the ſcope of this 68. Epiſtle written in the
Name of the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> to the Biſhops of <hi>Spain</hi>
by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> is to maintain <hi>Sabinus</hi> in his Biſhoprick, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that <hi>Stephanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> deſired them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcind
the ordination of <hi>Sabinus,</hi> and to replace <hi>Baſilides:</hi> That
<hi>Cyprian</hi> by <hi>whole fraternity</hi> means a particular Church, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by innumerable Epiſtles of his, as <hi>epiſt.</hi> 47. in two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places, and 58. in two ſeveral places; likewayes, and
63. in which laſt place, he affirms, <hi>when we are at Supper
at our Banquet, we cannot convocate the common People, that
we may celebrate the verity of the Sacrament, in preſence of
the whole fraternity.</hi> And thus we have ſhewed, with what
admirable Sophiſtry, our adverſaries endeavour to wreſt
this notable paſſage of <hi>Cyprian, epiſt.</hi> 55. in which we have
been the more prolix, becauſe from thence, they bring all
which they can pretend to be of any moment, to prove that
<hi>Cyprian</hi> was for the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi>
they alledge other teſtimonies, more pungent, but they ſhall
be proved forged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the following Chapters.</p>
               <p>The third teſtimony brought from the words of <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
is in the edition of <hi>Pamelius, Epiſt.</hi> 46. in which
<hi>Cornelius</hi> writing to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> hath theſe words; <hi>We are
not ignorant that there is but one God, &amp;c.</hi> and a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>that there ſhould be one Biſhop in the Catholick Church;</hi>
from whence they conclude <hi>an oecumenick Biſhop or
the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>as ſucceſſor to</hi> Peter <hi>Head of the
Curch.</hi> But it is anſwered, <hi>Cornelius</hi> in this Epiſtle, is
informing <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that ſome Shiſmaticks (who had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64826:179"/>
that Novatian Biſhop ſet up at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>Cornelius</hi>)
deſired to be re-admitted to his communion, confeſſing
their error, that they had been ſeduced, and now they
are convinced, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> was their true Biſhop:
amongſt other of their confeſſions, they profeſs they were
not ignorant, that there was but <hi>one God, one Chriſt, one
Holy Ghoſt, and that there ſhould be but one Biſhop in the
Catholick Church;</hi> by which it is evident, that by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church</hi> they mean any <hi>particular Church,</hi> and here
they mean <hi>the particular Church of</hi> Rome; of which they
acknowledge <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to be that <hi>one Biſhop,</hi> and not
that other <hi>Novation Biſhop by whom they had been ſeduced,
and whom they would acknowledge no more for their Biſhop,
ſince there could be but one true Biſhop of that Church,</hi> viz.
<hi>Cornelius himſelf.</hi> That this is the meaning of <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
in this Epiſtle, is further confirmed, in an Epiſtle of
his to <hi>Fabianus,</hi> (mentioned by <hi>Euſebius, Hiſt. lib. 6. cap.</hi>
35.) in which he objects ignorance to one, who knew
not, <hi>that there ſhould be but one Biſhop in the Catholick
Church;</hi> Here he means <hi>one Biſhop in the particular Church
of</hi> Rome. For a little after, in that Epiſtle, he affirms,
<hi>in that ſame Catholick Church there were fourty ſix Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
ſeven Deacons and ſeven ſub-deacons;</hi> but he could not
affirm, that in the whole Catholick Church, there were
only ſo many Presbyters, ſo many Deacons, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſub-deacons: whereby it is evident, that by <hi>one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
in the Catholick Church, Cornelius,</hi> means, there
ſhould be <hi>but one Biſhop in any particular Church;</hi> which
is ſo evident, that <hi>Chryſtopherſon,</hi> in his verſion of <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
renders theſe words of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> his Epiſtle to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian,</hi>
thus; <hi>he was ignorant that there ſhould be but one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
(in hac Eccleſia Catholica) in this Catholick Church, viz.</hi>
in this particular Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> neither is there any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64826:179"/>
more frequent in the writings of thoſe Ancients
then to to call every particular Church, <hi>the Catholick
Church,</hi> which obſerveth the purity of the Catholick Faith,
or Church univerſal.</p>
               <p>The fourth paſſage of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> is in his 40. Epiſtle,
directed to the people of <hi>Carthage, there is one God, one
Chriſt, one Chair, one Church founded upon</hi> Peter, <hi>by Chriſts
own mouth.</hi> But it is anſwered, it ſhall be proved in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Chapters, that thoſe laſt words are forged; the reſt
have no difficulty at all: for by <hi>one Chair</hi> and <hi>one Church,
Cyprian</hi> underſtands that there ſhould be but <hi>one Biſhop in
every particular Church;</hi> as is evident both by the ſcope and
words of the Epiſtle: the ſcope of the Epiſtle is, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
upon ſome Schiſmaticks, who had made a defection
from himſelf, and the Church of <hi>Carthage;</hi> where amongſt
other reaſons, againſt their defection, this is one; <hi>there is
but one Chair, viz. there is but one Biſhop in the Cburch
of</hi> Carthage, Cyprian <hi>himſelf:</hi> and ſince none ought to
be acknowledged <hi>Biſhop but he,</hi> they were Schiſmaticks in
making a ſeparation from him. This reaſoning of <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
had been moſt ridiculous, if by <hi>one Chair</hi> he had
meaned an <hi>oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> viz. if he had reaſoned
thus; <hi>they are Schiſmaticks, who made a defection
from their Biſhop</hi> Cyprian; <hi>becauſe there is but one oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentick
Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that this is the meaning of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> appears
by the following words, where <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirms, <hi>they had
made to themſelves another Altar,</hi> intimating thereby, that
there is but one Altar in the Church: whereby it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that he ſpeaks not of the Church univerſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64826:180"/>
that they who make a defection from the Church,
<hi>make another Altar unto themſelves:</hi> but <hi>Pamelius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in his Annotations upon that Epiſtle, obſerves,
that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in that place, is ſpeaking only of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that by <hi>one Chair</hi> cannot be meaned <hi>one Biſhop
of the Church univerſal,</hi> is evident, becauſe <hi>Cathedra</hi> or
<hi>Chair,</hi> is not one in the whole Church, ſince there are
many Chaires in it: as is affirmed by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his
preſcriptions, <hi>cap.</hi> 36.</p>
               <p>The laſt paſſage they object out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> is from his
Epiſtle to <hi>Pompeius,</hi> where he affirmeth, <hi>no man can have
God to his Father, who has not the Church to his Mother,
Coſterus</hi> the Jeſuit, <hi>Apolog. part.</hi> 3. objects this paſſage
of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to prove that <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the mother
Church,</hi> and likewayes to prove <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Romes <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</hi>
But the impudence of <hi>Coſterus</hi> is very great, for
<hi>Cyprian</hi> in that whole Epiſtle, diſputes with ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
and bitterneſs againſt the Church and Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Pamelius</hi> wiſheth <hi>it had never been written:</hi> and
it ſhall be proved in the laſt Chapter of this Book, that
the ſaid Epiſtle of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>Pompeius,</hi> and others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of his Epiſtles of the ſame ſubject, are left out in ſome
new Roman editions of <hi>Cyprians</hi> works. As for the words
now alledged, <hi>Coſterus</hi> miſerably wreſts them; for in them
he is diſputing againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the
very next words, he accuſeth <hi>Stephanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
not only of <hi>Error,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Obſtinacy:</hi> his diſpute is this;
<hi>Thoſe who are baptized by hereticks, ought to be re-baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
becauſe the Sanctification of baptiſme, is only to be
found in the Church,</hi> (apud Chriſti ſponſam ſolam) <hi>who
can beget and bring forth children unto God:</hi> but they
who are baptized by hereticks, <hi>are not born in the Church,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64826:180"/>
neither can they have God to their Father, who have not the
Church for their Mother.</hi> Ergo, <hi>they ought to be re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi>
And a little after he adds, <hi>how comes it then, that
the ſevere Obſtinacie of our brother</hi> Stephanus, (Biſhop of
<hi>Rome) is come to ſuch an hight?</hi> he means, by that
<hi>excommunication of himſelf, and the Church of</hi> Carthage,

               <p>By which paſſage of <hi>Cyprian</hi> with <hi>Stephanus</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,

Supremacy of the ſaid <hi>Stephanus:</hi> becauſe in it, he writes
to him (<hi>ſay they) to depoſe</hi> Marcianus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Arles
<hi>in</hi> France. But it appears by the words of the Epiſtle,
that <hi>Cyprian</hi> only exhorts <hi>Stephanus, to admoniſh the Biſhops

what was the opinion of <hi>Cyprian</hi> concerning the power

               <p>HItherto, they have endeavoured to prove the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the death of
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> by wreſted and miſapplyed teſtimonies:

by the Popes authority or otherwayes:</hi> we will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the firſt ſort in this Chapter, of the ſecond in the
following.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, they pretend the <hi>decretal Epiſtles</hi> of
ſeveral Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who lived in that interval, and
after, unto the beginning of the fourth Age. But it is anſwered,
all thoſe decretals are forged, attributed to Popes before the
dayes of <hi>Syrictus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who lived about <hi>anno,</hi> 380.
the reaſons follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus,</hi> a diligent Compilator of all the
decretals of Popes, in one volumne, begins this work
with the decretals of the ſaid <hi>Syritius,</hi> not mentioning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal
Epiſtles of any Popes before him: whereby it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears, that there was no ſuch <hi>decretalls,</hi> in his time, or
in the <hi>ſixth Century,</hi> whereby alſo it is evident, that they have
been forged ſince that time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thoſe <hi>decretalls</hi> are mentioned by non of the
Ancients moſt exact enquirers after antiquity; ſuch as
<hi>Euſebius, Hieronymus, Gennadius,</hi> and Pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi>
who lived himſelf in the time of <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> and to whom
<hi>Hieronymus</hi> was Secretar, but all thoſe Authors; made exact
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64826:181"/>
enquiry, after the actions of Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the
Council of <hi>Neice:</hi> and yet not one of them, maketh mention
of thoſe decretals, which are at leaſt thirty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſtiles of men are almoſt as different, as their
faces: but it appears to any Judicious Reader, that all thoſe
<hi>Epiſtles</hi> were penned by one man, having the ſame ſtile,
but they are attributed to <hi>Biſhops of Rome,</hi> of divers Ages,
whereof the laſt lived three hundred year after the firſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Latine Tongue, before the Council of
<hi>Neice,</hi> was in great purity: and the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> of thoſe
dayes, known to be moſt powerful in it: but the ſtile of
thoſe <hi>decretals,</hi> is moſt barbarous. <hi>Turrianus</hi> objects,
(who wrote a defence of thoſe Epiſtles) that thoſe Biſhops of
<hi>Rome</hi> uſed a humble ſtile, in imitation of <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſhunned
<hi>the words of humane wiſdom.</hi> But it is anſwered, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Paul</hi> did forbid affected eloquence, yet he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrive
<hi>ſoliciſmes,</hi> and <hi>barbarity,</hi> which both are frequent in thoſe
Epiſtles. And firſt, for <hi>Soliciſmes, Enariſtus, epiſt. 2. Epiſcopi
ſunt obediendi &amp; non detrahendi: Teleſphorus</hi> in his Epiſtle
hath theſe words, <hi>Patres omnes ſunt venerandi non inſidiandi,</hi>
ſuch like expreſſions are found every where. As for <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes,</hi>
you have everywhere, ſuch expreſſions as thoſe folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Rigoroſus tortor, dependere obtemperantiam: agere indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinate;
jurgialiter ſtare; paternas doctrinas injuriare: cuncta
charitative peragere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Iſidorus Mercator,</hi> who lived in the ſeventh Age,
challenged by <hi>Barronius, ad annum, 336. num.</hi> 80. and 60.
as a great forger of monuments of Antiquity: he lived in the 7.
Age, at which time, there was great debate between the
Greek and the Latin Church; the Greek Church, refuſing
to acknowledge the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> albeit
<hi>Phocas,</hi> in the beginning of that Age, had taken the title of
<hi>oecumenick Biſhop,</hi> from <hi>Cyriacus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:64826:182"/>
and beſtowed it upon <hi>Bonifacius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſtill keeped the
ſtile of <hi>oecumenick Biſhop</hi> and would not acknowledge the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Iſidorus Mercator,</hi> as <hi>Barronius</hi> relates, forged
ſeveral monuments of Antiquity, to prove the ſupremacy
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and he is commonly thought to be
the forger of thoſe decretalls, for three reaſons; firſt, (as
we ſaid) he is detected of ſeveral other forgeries; ſecondly,
becauſe it appears by their ſtile, they are all written by one
man; thirdly, becauſe the ſtile is barbarous, and exactly
agreeing with the ſtile of that Age, in which <hi>Iſidorus</hi> lived.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, it is demonſtrat thoſe Epiſtles are forged, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the ſtile, but by the matter contained in them: It were
prolix to mention all; we will only note ſome few, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
demonſtrating thoſe decretals to be forged. Firſt,
ſome of them are directed to thoſe who were dead long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
as that Epiſtle of <hi>Clement,</hi> to <hi>James,</hi> in which he
writes to him of the death of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul:</hi> but <hi>James</hi> was
dead in the ſeventh year of <hi>Nero,</hi> as is teſtified by <hi>Euſebius,
Hegeſippus,</hi> and <hi>Hieronymus;</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> died not till
ſeven years after, <hi>viz.</hi> the fourteenth year of <hi>Nero. 2. Anterius</hi>
in his decretal, makes mention of <hi>Euſebius Biſhop of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
and <hi>Felix Biſhop of Epheſus:</hi> but <hi>Anterus</hi> lived in the
beginning of the third Century, almoſt a whole Age before
them both. 3. <hi>Fabianus</hi> in his Epiſtle, makes mention
of the coming of <hi>Novatus</hi> to <hi>Italy;</hi> but <hi>Cyprian, lib.
1. epiſt.</hi> 3. affirms, that <hi>Fabianus</hi> came to <hi>Italy</hi> in the time
of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who lived at another time. 4. <hi>Marcellus</hi> writes a
threatning Letter to <hi>Maxentius,</hi> preſſing him with the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Clement</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> but <hi>Maxentius</hi> both a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
and a Tyrant, cared nothing for <hi>Clement</hi> at all. 5. <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrinus</hi>
in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> affirms, that it was
againſt the conſtitutions of Emperours, that <hi>Clergy men ſhould
be called before the Judge Secular:</hi> the ſame is affirmed by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:64826:182"/>
in his Decretal to the ſame <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> But in thoſe
dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> In the third Century, the Emperours were all
Pagans: and it is ridiculous to affirm, that they made ſuch
Edicts, in favour of Chriſtians, who were cruel perſecuters of
the Chriſtians 6. Its known, that many ceremonies came by
degrees in the Church, and that there were very few ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in the Church, the time of thoſe Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> but
thoſe decretal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Epiſtles, makes no mention of the grievous
perſecutions of the Church in thoſe dayes, no not one of
them; but on the contrary, makes mention of the Church
as it were in pomp, making mention of all thoſe ceremonies,
as <hi>holy veſſels, of the habit of the Clergy, of the Maſs,</hi> of
<hi>Archbiſhops, Metropolitans, Patriarchs,</hi> none of which things
were in the Church in thoſe dayes: thoſe <hi>Cannons,</hi> commonly
called <hi>Apoſtolick,</hi> mention indeed <hi>Primats:</hi> but albeit they
contain many profitable things, yet many learned men among
the Papiſts themſelves, maintain, that they were not made by
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> but collected from Cannons of the Council of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
and other poſterior Councils: See <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> and <hi>Photius,
Bibliothick, cap.</hi> 113.</p>
               <p>We might alledge ſeveral other reaſons, to prove
thoſe Epiſtles forged, as their abſurd interpetation
of Scripture, ſome of them maintaining <hi>community of
wives,</hi> &amp;c. But thoſe reaſons are ſufficient, ſince <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
and <hi>Barronius</hi> ſeems not to care much for them; ſince <hi>Contius,</hi>
Profeſſour at <hi>Bruges,</hi> maintains them to be forged; ſince <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas
Silvius (epiſt.</hi> 301. according to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſupputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
288.) expreſly affirms, that before the Council of <hi>Niece,</hi>
there are no Monuments for the <hi>Popes Supremacy;</hi> which he
would never have affirmed, if he had not believed thoſe
Epiſtles had been forged, which ingeminate everywhere, the
<hi>Supremacy of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome: and yet the ſaid <hi>Aeneas Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
was afterwards Pope himſelf, under the name of <hi>Pius</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:64826:183"/>
ſecond. Whence we conclude, that thoſe Epiſtles were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to the Ancients. And whereas <hi>Turrianus</hi> objects, that
<hi>Iſidorus</hi> mentioneth them; It is anſwered, he is charged for
forging them. He objects, ſecondly, that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> turned
thoſe three Epiſtles of <hi>Clement;</hi> but it is anſwered, thoſe
Epiſtles of <hi>Clement</hi> are very old indeed, but they do not prove
the Antiquity of the reſt. The ſtile of theſe three Epiſtles of
<hi>Clement,</hi> is different from the ſtile of thoſe others: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Ruffinus,</hi> turned them from Greek to Latine, it
doth not prove, they are <hi>Authentick.</hi> He tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ned alſo his
Books of <hi>Recognitions,</hi> which are eſteemed <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> by
<hi>Gratianus, Bellarmine,</hi> and other Doctors of the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this much of thoſe decretal Epiſtles: they alledge
teſtimonies from ſeveral other forged Authors, in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval,
to prove the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in that
interval, as <hi>Abdias Biſhop of Babylon,</hi> is cited by <hi>Dorman</hi> to
prove the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome: Linus</hi> is cited
by <hi>Coccius,</hi> for the ſame reaſon; <hi>Clement</hi> by <hi>Harding.</hi> viz.
<hi>his books of recognition: Dyoniſius Areopagita, de divinis
nominibus,</hi> is ſeveral times cited by <hi>Coccius in Theſauro,</hi> for
the ſame end: but all theſe Authors, or thoſe books now
mentioned of thoſe Authors, are rejected by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or
<hi>Barronius,</hi> or <hi>Poſſevinus,</hi> or <hi>Cajetanus,</hi> or <hi>Grocinus,</hi> or
<hi>Sixtus, Senenſis</hi> and other lights of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and
therefore, it is needleſs to inſiſt upon the diſproving them;
we will only anſwer one paſſage falſly attributed to <hi>Euſebius,</hi>
or to <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> in his additions to <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and it is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to prove that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a <hi>legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative

viz. that lent faſt of 40 dayes was inſtituted by Teleſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
Biſhop of Rome,</hi> who lived in the ſecond Age, and this is his
firſt inſtance: But it is anſwered, that <hi>Scaliger,</hi> in his edition
of <hi>Euſebius</hi> demonſtrats, thoſe cannot be the words of <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:64826:183"/>
becauſe <hi>lib. 5. cap.</hi> 17. he expreſly affirms, that <hi>Montanus</hi>
the heretick was the firſt that preſcribed <hi>ſet faſts.</hi> Secondly,
becauſe <hi>cap.</hi> 34. of the ſame Book, <hi>Euſebius</hi> affirms from
<hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that in the time of <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who lived

ſhewedbefore. <hi>Barronius, tom. 1. pag. 129. Let one ſpeak for all</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>in time more ancient, in learning more excellent, in
honour of Martyrdom far exceeding the reſt of the Fathers, viz.
Cyprian:</hi> and then he cites this following paſſages out of
<hi>Cyprian, de unitate eccleſiae, cap. 3. To</hi> Peter, <hi>our Lord after
his reſurrection, ſaith,</hi> feed my ſheep; <hi>and buildeth his
Church upon him</hi> (alone.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:64826:184"/>
2. And although after his reſurrection, he gave alike power
to all, yet to manifeſt unity, he <hi>conſtitute one Chair,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by his authority the ſource or fountain of the ſame, <hi>beginning
of one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The reſt of the Apoſtles were, that <hi>Peter</hi> was; in equal
fellowſhip of honour and power: but the beginning cometh
of unity (<hi>the primacy is given to</hi> Peter) that the Church of
Chriſt may be ſhewed to be one, and (<hi>one Chair.</hi>)</p>
               <p>4. He that withſtandeth and reſiſteth the Church, (he that
<hi>forſaketh</hi> Peters <hi>Chair, upon which the Church is built;</hi>)
doth he truſt that he is in the Church?</p>
               <p>In theſe words obſerve, that all the ſentences written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a parentheſis, are forged, and not to be found in the old
Manuſcripts of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or in the old printed copies of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian;</hi>
the reaſon wherefore the ſaid ſentences are added
to the words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> is evident, becauſe they make <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
expreſly diſpute for the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter,</hi> but take
them away, the ſupremacy of <hi>Peter</hi> is quite deſtroyed; as
may appear to any who will read over theſe words, and
omit thoſe forged paſſages, written within a parentheſis.</p>
               <p>If ye demand how thoſe paſſages came to be added to
<hi>Cyprians</hi> text? It is anſwered, that <hi>Pius fourth Biſhop of</hi>
Rome, called <hi>Manutius</hi> the famous Printer to <hi>Rome,</hi> to reprint
the Fathers; he appointed alſo four Cardinals, to ſee the
work done, among the reſt, <hi>Cardinal Barromaeus</hi> had ſingular
care of <hi>Cyprian: Manutius</hi> himſelf, in his preface of a certain
Book to <hi>Pius</hi> fourth, declareth, that it was the purpoſe of
the <hi>Pope, to have them ſo corrected; that there ſhould
remain no ſpot, which might infect the minds of the ſimple,
with the ſhew of falſe Doctrine:</hi> How they corrected other
Fathers, ſhall be declared in the following Books? how
they corrected <hi>Cyprian,</hi> appears by thoſe words we have now
et down, which are marked with Parentheſis, which being
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64826:184"/>
added, perverts the whole meaning of <hi>Cyprian:</hi> neither were
they content, by adding to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to prevert his meaning:
other paſſages of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which could not be mended by
additions, or be made to ſpeak for them, by inſerting ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
unleſs they made <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeak manifeſt contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
thoſe other paſſages (I ſay) they razed quite out of
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> in the ſaid Roman Edition of <hi>Manutius, anno,</hi> 1564.
in which Edition, they razed out Eleven or Twelve entire
Epiſtles, as 1. 2. 3. 15. 21. 22. 71. 73. 74.
75. 83. 84. 85. 86. It were too prolix to declare,
for what reaſons they razed out all thoſe Epiſtles
the ſum is, <hi>all of them were no great friends to
the ſupremacy of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>nor to the Doctrine
of the preſent Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>anent the perfection of the
Scripture.</hi> We will cite a paſſage or two, out of the 74.
and 75. Epiſtle, which will evidently make known, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they razed thoſe Epiſtles: ſurely there muſt be ſome
great reaſon, ſince <hi>Pamelius</hi> himſelf wiſheth, <hi>thoſe Epiſtles
had never been written:</hi> What the reaſon is, appears thus?
The 74. Epiſtle was written to <hi>Pompeius,</hi> againſt the
Epiſtle of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> in which ye have theſe words, <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Haereticorum, cauſum contra chriſtianos &amp; contra Eccleſiam
Dei aſſerere conatur;</hi> and a little after, <hi>Reus in uno, videtur,
reus in omnibus:</hi> That is, Stephanus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
the cauſe of hereticks againſt the Church; who is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in one thing, he ſeems to be guilty of all.</hi> The 75.
Epiſtle, was written by <hi>Firmilianus</hi> to <hi>Cyprian;</hi> in which
ye have theſe words, <hi>Non intelligit obfuſcari à ſe, &amp;c.</hi> that is,
Stephanus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>underſtands not, that the truth of
the chriſtian Rock is obfuſcated by him, and in a manner
aboliſhed.</hi> The words of which two Epiſtles, are very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> thoſe
Epiſtles are every where filled with ſuch expreſſions, too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64826:185"/>
to be anſwered here; but theſe we have mentioned, are
ſufficient to declare, what the opinion of <hi>Cyprian</hi> was, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the
Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the ſaid 74. Epiſtle,
in ſeveral places he calls the ſaid <hi>Stephanus ignorant, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
&amp;c. inſolent, impertinent, &amp;c.</hi> in the 75. Epiſtle, <hi>Stephanus</hi>
is called <hi>wicked, inſolent, a deſerter and betrayer of the truth:</hi>
Likewayes, what a friend <hi>Cyprian</hi> was, to the Doctrine of
the Modern Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> appears by the ſaid 74.
Epiſtle; where <hi>tradition</hi> without warrand of <hi>Scripture,</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by him <hi>Vetuſtas Erroris, antiquity of Error,</hi> and affirms, that
<hi>all is to be rejected for ſuch, which is not found in Scripture:
ſo it concern matters of Faith:</hi> whereby it appears, that
<hi>Cyprian incurres the Anathema of the council of</hi> Trent. And
this we have ſhewed how they have corrupted <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as
well in adding to him, to make him ſpeak what he thought
not; and when that would not ſerve the turn, except they
made him ſpeak contradictions, they therefore alſo cutted
out his tongue: what reaſon they had ſo to do, we have
given ſome inſtances; many ſuch other might be given, but
it would be prolix, and theſe are ſufficient. Now let us
hear, how they defend thoſe <hi>Impoſtures,</hi> and firſt, for the
razing out of thoſe <hi>Epiſtles, Gretſerus</hi> anſwers, <hi>Pamelius reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in his edition of Cyprian.</hi> But it is replyed, that
this is as much as to ſay, that by the teſtimony of <hi>Pamelius,</hi>
Pope <hi>Pius</hi> Fourth, and thoſe four <hi>Cardinals,</hi> whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to correct the works of <hi>Cyprian, are notorius im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors:</hi>
It is a new ſort of reaſoning, that <hi>they did no wrong,
in razing out thoſe Epiſtles of</hi> Cyprian, <hi>becauſe</hi> Pamelius <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they defend thoſe <hi>additions by an old copy of
the Abbey of Cambron: 2. By a coppy fetched out of</hi> Bavaria;
3. <hi>And by an other old coppy of</hi> Cardinal Hoſius; and ſo <hi>Gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerus</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:64826:185"/>
the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> defends the laſt three additions. But it is
anſwered, that the firſt addition <hi>upon him alone,</hi> is the moſt
important of all; intimating, that upon <hi>Peter alone</hi> the
Church was built, which is the main <hi>Baſis</hi> of <hi>the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome: but <hi>Gretſerus</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who
defends this corruption of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> doth not affirm, that
thoſe words <hi>upon him alone</hi> are found in any of theſe three
Copies, he only affirms, that the ſecond addition <hi>one Chair,</hi>
and the third, <hi>the Primacy is given to</hi> Peter, are found in
thoſe old Copies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is replyed, that that Copy of <hi>Cardinal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
is only mentioned, but it was never yet ſeen: If <hi>Hoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
had any ſuch Copy, how comes he left not ſuch a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of antiquity to Poſterity? As for the other two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
of <hi>Cambron</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> it is a ridiculous buſineſs,
to object their Authority, againſt the Authority, not only
of all the printed Copies of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> before that of <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
but alſo againſt all the Manuſcripts of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> found
in the moſt famous Bibliothicks of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican</hi>
it ſelf: and whereas <hi>Gretſerus</hi> affirms, that perhaps the
<hi>Wicklephian Hereticks,</hi> corrupted all thoſe Ancient Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts,
it is a ridiculous objection: how could thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
get acceſs to the Libraries of all <hi>Princes, Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities</hi>
and the <hi>Popes</hi> own Library, to corrupt the works of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
without being perceived? It is far more like, that
the Monks of <hi>Cambron</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> corrupted thoſe two
copies, (If the Jeſuits have not forged thoſe two copies
alſo) ſince there are innumerable proofs and teſtimonies, (as
ſhall be proved in the following Books,) Yea, and of <hi>Barro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
himſelf; that the Monks of ſeveral <hi>Monaſtries</hi> have
corrupted and forged innumerable paſſages of Antiquity,
eſpecially in the ſeventh Age, when the conteſt was hot,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64826:186"/>
with the Grecians about the Supremacy. The truth is, it is
believed, that there are no ſuch Copies at all, as that of
<hi>Cambron</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and that thoſe Cardinals, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Pius</hi> fourth, to overſee the Edition of <hi>Manutius,</hi> added
thoſe words of themſelves, which is very like for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
Firſt, becauſe it is known, that the <hi>Indices expurgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii,
have added ſentences, and razed out ſentences at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in many Antient Copies, without the pretext of any other
Copy.</hi> Secondly, their impudence was as great, in razing
out of thoſe twelve Epiſtles of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as if they had added
thoſe four paſſages. And ſince they openly did the firſt, it
is very probable, yea more then probable, they did the
laſt.</p>
               <p>We have ſhewed, how <hi>Gretſerus</hi> defends the firſt three
additions. The Fourth is, <hi>he that forſaketh</hi> Peters <hi>Chair,
upon which the Church is built,</hi> it ſeems that either thoſe three
Copies of <hi>Gretſerus</hi> hath not theſe words, or elſe if they have,
<hi>Pamelius</hi> doth not much regard their Authority, who in his
Edition of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> hath left them out. It is to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the ſecond and third <hi>Addition</hi> are of no ſuch
moment, as the firſt, and this fourth, and the razing
out of theſe twelve Epiſtles of <hi>Cyprian. Gretſerus</hi> defends
only the ſecond and the third; the Firſt he meddleth not
with at all; to the Fourth <hi>he anſwereth, that</hi> Pamelius
<hi>hath left it out, and therefore it was not added fraudently:</hi>
But we anſwer, as we did before, that <hi>Pamelius</hi> in leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out thoſe words, <hi>declares thoſe four Cardinal Impoſtors,</hi>
who were appointed by <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, to overſee the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Manutius;</hi> whoſe Copy is followed in the reprinted
works of <hi>Cyprian</hi> at <hi>Rome, Paris, Antwerp,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus we have minuted, all which is of any moment
alledged, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> for the Supremacy of the Biſhop
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64826:186"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the death of <hi>Cyprian:</hi> where we have
proved, by the teſtimonies of <hi>Ignatius, Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
himſelf, that <hi>there was no Office in the Church, above
that of a Biſhop, in that whole Interval: Bellarmine</hi> braggs
much, <hi>that the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>to</hi> Peter, <hi>in
the Monarchy of the Church, was an article of Faith in
all Ages, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles.</hi> But ſince we
find no monuments in that interval, next the Ages of the
Apoſtles, that <hi>there was any ſuch Article of Faith,</hi> but on
the contrary, ſince we have produced teſtimonies, and
invincible ones, that there was no ſuch Article of Faith,
it is evident, <hi>that the ſaid ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome
<hi>to</hi> Peter <hi>in the Monarchy of the Church, is a meer cheat:</hi>
For if there had been any ſuch thing, the Churches of
the Eaſt, and Weſt, in the times of <hi>Victor,</hi> and the
Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> in the times of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have neglected the <hi>excommunication of Victor</hi> and
<hi>Stephanus,</hi> and died unreconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>
Neither would the middle Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have placed
them in the Catalogue of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyres,</hi> if it had been
believed as an Article of Faith, <hi>that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome
<hi>ſucceeded to</hi> Peter <hi>Jure divino in the Monarchy of the Church,</hi>
as is believed now in the Modern Roman Church, <hi>as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith neceſſar to Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we have concluded the firſt Part of <hi>the grand
Impoſtor,</hi> and have proved by Teſtimonies of Antiquity,
(notwithſtanding all the bragging of our Adverſaries,
that all Antiquity is for them) That the Antients,
Councills, and Fathers, believed neither <hi>the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of</hi> Peter, nor that <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome, nor that
<hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>ſucceded to him, in the Monarchy of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64826:187"/>
the Church;</hi> and conſequently, did not believe any <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar
communion with the Church of</hi> Rome: To prove
which, they bring nothing from Antiquity of the firſt
three Centuries, which is not <hi>perverted, mutilated, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
tranſlated</hi> or <hi>forged.</hi> In the Second Part ſhall be
proved, they have as little ſhelter for their Tenets, from
the death of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> 260. to 604. when <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the
third was made oecumenick Biſhop, by <hi>Phocas.</hi>
