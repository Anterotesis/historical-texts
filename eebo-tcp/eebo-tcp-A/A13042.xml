            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable and graue Senators, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and peaceful entrance into this land, and ioyfull poſſeſſion of our Leige Lord, of his immediate right of the Imperiall crowne of England, and the vtter baniſhment of all doubt in the Regall ſucceſſion, with the vniuerſall hearts applauſe of all his Highneſſe Engliſh ſubiects, who with one conſent acknowledged their loue and dutie vnto his lawfull right in Soueraigntie, all which in the ſpeedy effecting and eſtabliſhing of peace in this kingdome was much more then either our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations held poſſible to bee ſo eaſily perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb facs="tcp:18437:3"/>
A appeared by their great admiration vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the certaine knowledge thereof, or was right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtood of the multitude that wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes the benefite, as too plainely appeareth by their wilful ingratitude &amp; forgetfulnes, ſeeing their long continued feare ſo quickely ſuppreſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expectation conuerted into as great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and tranquilitie, as either their hearts could wiſh, or is enioyed by any other nation. All theſe, and many other high bleſſings of Almightie God ſtill ſucceeded one another, &amp; no man would once hold vp his finger to make preſent acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or publicke vnderſtanding vnto poſterities, of the boundleſſe and wondrous workes of God in theſe our daies, as alſo of the manifold remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able accidents which haue happened of late yeares.</p>
            <p>Theſe motiues, I ſay, with the earneſt perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of diuers graue and honourable perſonages, who neuer ceaſed to accite mee vnto this preſent Act of Chronologie, haue directly cauſed mee to performe this generall buſineſſe, in which my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious labours I haue been intollerably abuſed and ſcandalized by <hi>Thraſo, Momus, Zoylus,</hi> and other backebiters, &amp; detractors: concerning whom, ſith it is <hi>the leaſt of offences to offend offenders,</hi> I will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vexe my ſelfe, nor trouble your patience in ſeeking to pleaſe the enuious and inſatiate. But foraſmuch as I highly prize the good content of the honeſt, wiſe, and vertuous, thus was the courſe and manner of my proceeding herein.</p>
            <p>After I had well obſerued, that no man would
<pb facs="tcp:18437:3"/>
lend a helping hand vnto the late aged painefull chronicler: neither in many moneths after his death, that any would expoſe or ſhewe themſelues to proſecute ſo good a worke: and albeit that in this interim, &amp; before, there were many named to haue already entred into this Labyrinth, yet not one appeared: whereupon I remembred the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Philoſopher: <hi>That the naming of many friends, is a maine impediment vnto friendſhip.</hi> And as in that, ſo in this; then for my own cleare ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; full aſſurance, that I would neither preiudice nor preuent any others better proceeding, I ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into particular conference with euery man whoſe names had beene diuulged. Some of them of honourable rancke and reuerent qualitie: all of them learned, &amp; of good ſufficiency, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of anſwered me, they thought that the giuing out of their names in this ſort, was rather done by their ſecret enemies, of purpoſe to draw them into ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall diſpleaſure, and to bring their names &amp; liues into a generall queſtion, then for any other intent of good: other ſaide, who doth this worke, muſt flatter, which I cannot, neither will I wilfully leaue a ſcandall vnto my poſteritie. Another ſaid, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how in any ciuil action a man ſhould ſpend his trauell, time &amp; mony worſe, then in that which acquires no regard, nor reward, except backebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; detraction. And one amongſt the reſt after he had ſworne an oath, ſaide: I thanke God that I am not yet madde, to waſt my time, ſpend two hundred pound a yeare, trouble my ſelfe, &amp; all my friends, onely to gaine aſſurance of endleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch,
<pb facs="tcp:18437:4"/>
loſſe of libertie, and bring all my dayes in queſtion: &amp; like as theſe ſpake, ſo did many others. And in concluſion, I ſawe it vtterly refuſed of all. And by this time it was generally obſerued, that this worke was wholly neglected. Then many of my friends began againe to animate me, and very ſeriouſly required me to make ſupplement: whoſe kinde perſwaſions preuailed ſo farre, that I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to doe my indeuour, onely for one yeares ſpace, wherein my good will exceeded my beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as I found afterwards, for that it is not a yeare or two wherein a man may obtaine the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities of truth, neither accompliſh any thing to the effect in this ſolide and variable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment. Then forthwith I repaired to the moſt honourable ſuperiours, vnto whom I humbly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified my zealous loue, dutie, and diligence in this generall ſeruice of my Prince and Country. Of whom I receiued very gracious incouragement, &amp; honorable inſtructions. And after that, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with diuers graue Elders, louers of vertue, and fauourers of the Cities honour, by whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, with all meekeneſſe I manifeſted my wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe vnto the Lord Maior, and Court of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, being then reſolued, neither to breake my former promiſe, nor to neglect ſo great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall a good for any deprauing ſpeeches, or maleuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aſpects, with all integritie; ſince which time I haue ſpent in this buſines ſixteene yeares without any great cauſe of encouragement. May it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pleaſe your wiſedomes rightly to vnderſtand that in all my proceedings I haue neither preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:18437:4"/>
too farre of my ſelfe, nor done ought that might diſcourage, or preuent any other. And thus much for the cauſe and maner of my proceeding.</p>
            <p>Now right honourable, and moſt worthy El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whoſe ſtate and gouernment is renowned through the world: what is hee that hath any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and knowes not London to bee the moſt flouriſhing and peacefull Cittie of Europe? of greateſt antiquitie, happieſt in countinuance, moſt increaſed, chiefe in proſperitie, and moſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with plentie? and here I might alleadge many ancient preſidents of pleaſures, profits, time, and ſtate, whereof neuer any ſubordinate Magiſtrates could equall yours. But ſeeing few wordes to the wiſe ſuffice, I will onely ſpeake a word or two by the way. The promiſed bleſſing vnto the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Iſraelites to poſſeſſe a land that flowed with milke and hony, is with ſeuen fold meaſure heaped on your heads, your citty filled more aboundantly with all ſorts of ſilkes, fine linnen, oyles, wines, and ſpices, perfection of Arts, &amp; all coſtly ornaments, and curious workemanſhip, then any other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince: ſo as London well deſerues to beare the name of the choiceſt ſtorehouſe in the world, and to keepe ranke with any royall Cittie in Europe: her Cittizens rich and bounteous, witneſſe their franke-giuing of more then twice ſeuen fifteens in one yeare, and their long continued charges and expence, as well vpon all occaſions by ſea and land for defence of their Prince and Country, as in ayding and relieuing their diſtreſſed neighbour Nations, and in performing many other worthy
<pb facs="tcp:18437:5"/>
matters for their owne honour, the delight of ſtrangers, and the reliefe of the poore, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: ſo as without offence it may truely be ſaid, that the liberalitie of the Londoners, is but halfe knowne to their common friends. Peace and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the higheſt degree poſſeſſeth now your gates and pallaces: all nations repaire with willingneſſe to bee partakers of your happineſſe: many other glorious Cities haue many waies wanted theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant bleſſings: witneſſe the famous Citie Rome, which hath beene often ſpoiled and ſacked: the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Moſco, which not long ſince was twice ſpoiled with fire, the firſt by her enemies, the laſt was a priuate politicke practiſe of her owne Emperour. The like misfortune hath befallen vnto the great Cittie Conſtantinople. Stately Antwerpe hath felt the ſmart of diuers changes within mans memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Populous Paris of late yeares was glad to beat downe her owne Suburbs, and cut her skirts ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, leaſt other ſhould ſit vpon them: Cracouia, Liſhbon, and many other royall Citties were glad and faine to ſeeke and ſue for that which is freely giuen vnto her. Theſe laſt haue I cited to bee as a looking-glaſſe to London; ſith it is as impoſſible for any to know their proper face &amp; feature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an obiect, as it is for any people to bee truely ſenſible of their owne felicirie, that haue not ſeene nor taſted others miſery.</p>
            <p>And thus (right Honourable and graue Fathers) although it was my meaning to haue vſed breuity, yet being inforced to the contrary, I craue your pardon, leaſt I haue offended by prolixitie. And
<pb facs="tcp:18437:5"/>
becauſe I will for euer be exempt, and free from all danger of all precurrant vipers, lurking Adders, and venemous tongues, I here conclude, with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my loue, and the continuance of a double prentiſhip, not onely of theſe my free offered la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in this Abridgement, but alſo my larger Booke, the which I likewiſe reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto your kind acceptation, hauing as well formerly as at this preſent proclaimed a ceſſation from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupplement or continuance of the generall Engliſh Chronicle, to the end they might and ſhall for euer be truely vnderſtood, that I haue no cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the enuious who neuer did good them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues nor ſpeake well of others, being euer deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to doe my beſt to auoide all impediments that may any way impeach others better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, wiſhing you all encreaſe of your hearts deſire, and euerlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ritaine,</hi> is an Iſland in the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sea, ſituate right ouer againſt France, one part of which Iſle Engliſhmen doe inhabite, another part Scots, the third part Welſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the fourth part Corniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. All they either in language, conditions, or lawes, doe differ among themſelues. England is the greateſt part, which is diuided into <hi>40.</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which we call ſhires: whereof ten (that is to ſay) Kent, Suſſex, Surrey, South-hampton, Barkeſhire, Wilſhire, Dorſetſhire, Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Deuonſhire, and Cornwall, doe containe the firſt part of that Iſland, which part bounding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South, ſtandeth betweene the thames and the Sea.</p>
               <p>From thence to the Riuer of Trent, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through the midſt of England bee <hi>16.</hi> ſhires, whereof the firſt ſixe (ſtanding Eaſtward) are Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, Middleſex, Hartfordſhire, Suffolke, North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18437:8"/>
and Cambridgeſhire. The other ten, which ſtand more in the middle of the country, are theſe: Bedford, Huntington, Buckingham, Oxford, Northampton, Rutland, Leiceſter, Notingham, Warwicke, and Lincolne. After theſe there be <hi>6,</hi> which border Weſtward vpon Wales, as Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Hereford, Worceſter, Shropſhire, Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and Cheſter. About the middle of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Darbiſhire, Yorkeſhire, Lancaſhire, &amp; Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland. On the left hand toward the Weſt, is Weſtmerland: againſt the ſame is the Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricke of Durham, and Northumberland, which boundeth vpon the North, in the Marches of Scotland. Theſe ſhires be diuided into xxii. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprickes, Canterbury, Rocheſter, London, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, Wincheſter, Saliſbury, Exceſter, Bath and Welles, Worceſter, Gloceſter, Hereford, Couentry and Lichfield, Lincolne, Ely, Norwich, Oxford, Peterborow, Briſtow. And this is the prouince of the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, which is the Primate of England, with Wales. Yorke, Durham, Cheſter, and Carlile, is the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of the Arch-biſhop of Yorke, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Primate of England. The Ocean ſea doth bound England: the firſt part of Britaine Eaſt and South Wales, and Cornwall Weſt. The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Twéede diuideth England and Scotland North. The length of the Iſland beginneth at Portſmouth in the South part, and endeth at Twéed in the North,<note place="margin">Scotland another part of Britaine.</note> containing <hi>320.</hi> Miles.</p>
               <p>Scotland, after the ouerthrow of the Picts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at the riuer Twéed, &amp; ſo méeting at the riuer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18437:8"/>
Tine. Therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length of Scotland, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Twéed to the furtheſt coaſt, is eſtéemed to be <hi>480.</hi> myles: But as Scotland is longer than England, ſo is it narrower. The ſaid riuer of Twéed ſeparateth the marches from Northumberland, the fartheſt country of England: the chiefe towne whereof is Barwicke, now in poſſeſſion of the Engliſh. The weſterne limite of Scotland, whilome was Cumberland, which the riuer of Selue diuideth from Annandall. Betwéene theſe two Regions, the Cheuiot hilles appeare. Next to the marches, Pictland bordereth, bounding vpon the Eaſt. The moſt famous townes, be Dunber, Hadding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Leigh, Northbarwicke, and Edenbrough the Kings ſeat. The ſame Cittie, the riuer called the Frith, doth water and paſſe by: the ſame riuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine diuideth from Loughdean, a country adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning called the Fife, in which country are many townes, as Donfermile, Cupre: but the notable towne of S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> ſpecially famous for the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie, and Sea of the Arch-biſhop. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide toward the Iriſh ſide Northward, is <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſdalia,</hi> ſo called of the riuer that paſſeth thereby, where be the townes of Douglaſſe, and Doufrie. Vpon the South adioyneth Galloway, where is the towne called Coſwel, and the ancient Temple of S. <hi>Ninian.</hi> By that ſtandeth the countrey of <hi>Haricta</hi> once renowned with the towne Haricton, whereof perchance it tooke the name. About Hari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, towards the weſt, is Elgonia bordering vpon the Ocean, whereon is the Lake Lomunde, which is very broad &amp; large, containing many Iſlands,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18437:9"/>
ſituate at the foote of the mountaine Grantſhayn, eight miles from the Caſtle of Doubriton. A good ſpace on this ſide Grampius riſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riuer Taus, the greateſt of all Scotland, taking his name of Atholl and Calidonia, a lake from whence it ſpringeth, which falling by many places, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by S. <hi>Iohns</hi> towne, and laſtly by Dunde, and there breaketh into the Germaine ſea. Againſt Taus is Anguiſe, and is diuided from Fife. To the ſame vpon the North, adioyneth Atheles. On the other ſide Argile ſheweth it ſelfe, being full of Lakes, whoſe vttermoſt bounds ſtretch ſo farre as Ireland, about which the promontary of fote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, called Lands-head ſtandeth.</p>
               <p>Betwéene Argatele and Olgouia weſtward, lyeth the countrey of Sterling. Héere the Forreſt of Calidonia beganne on the left ſide, there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the Caſtle of Calidone ſituate by Taus, called Doucheldin. From a little hill of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, riſeth Cluid.</p>
               <p>Of that riuer the Dale was called Glotenale: which country that riuer runneth by, and in the ſame is the Citty of Glaſco, a goodly Vniuerſity. Againe, towards the Eaſt is ioyned the country of Anguis and Merne, vpon the ſea coaſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Fordunne by ſituation is very ſtrong. Of the ſame ſide of Scotland is the countrey of Marre, garniſhed with a citty called Aberdon, ſtanding betweene the two riuers of Dona and Dea. Then followeth Morry, which the two notable riuers doe compaſſe about, called Nea and Spea. At the mouth of the laſt riuer, ſtandeth the towne of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18437:9"/>
Elgis: But in the middle part ſtandeth the broad country of Roſſia. The breadth of the Iſland is ſcarſe xxx. miles ouer, which defended with thrée promontories like Towers, repelleth the great waues and ſurges of the ſea: and inuironed with two gulfes, which thoſe promentories do incloſe, the entries be quiet and calme, &amp; the water peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The ſtrait of the land is at this day called Cathanes, coaſting vpon the ſea Deucalidon.</p>
               <p>About Scotland in the Iriſh ſeas are xl. Ilands: many of theſe in length at leaſt are <hi>30.</hi> miles, but in breadth not aboue <hi>12.</hi> Amongſt them is <hi>Iona,</hi> beautified with the tombs of the Scottiſh Kings. Beyond Scotland towards the North be the Iles of Orcades, the which are <hi>30.</hi> in number the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall of which Ilands is Panonia.</p>
               <p>Beyond the Orcades ſtandeth <hi>Thule,</hi> in the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen ſea now called Iſland.</p>
               <p>The other part Northerne, and full of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, a very rude &amp; homely kinde of people doth inhabite, which are called the Redſhankes, or wild Scots, and thus much of Scotland.</p>
               <p>Wales lieth on the left hand:<note place="margin">Wales the third part of Britain.</note> which like a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montary or foreland on euery ſide is compaſſed with the maine ſea: except it be on the Southeaſt part with the Riuer of Seuerne, which diuideth Wales from England. Therefore Wales is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from the towne of Chepſtow, where it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth by a ſtraight line, a little aboue Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, euen to Weſtcheſter Northward. Into that part ſo many of the Britaines as remained aliue after the ſlaughter &amp; loſſe of their country, at the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18437:10"/>
length did repaire, where partly through refuge of the mountaines, and partly of the woods and marſhes, they remained in ſafety: which part they enioy to this day.<note place="margin">4 Biſhops in Wales.</note> There bee many townes and ſtrong Caſtles, and foure Biſhoprickes. The firſt is S. <hi>Dauids,</hi> another <hi>Landaffe,</hi> the third <hi>Bangor,</hi> and the fourth S. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> which be vnder the Arch-biſhop of Canterbury. The Welſhmen haue a language from the Engliſhmen, which as they ſay, doth partly ſound of the Troian anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and partly of the Gréeke. And thus much of Wales.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cornwall.</note>Cornwall beginneth on that ſide which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth towards Spaine weſtward: toward the Eaſt, it is of length foureſcore and ten miles, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a little beyond S. <hi>Germaines,</hi> ſituate on the right hand vpon the ſea coaſt, where the greateſt breadth of that countrey is but twenty miles. It bordereth vpon England, Weſt, South &amp; North: The maine ſea is round about it: it is a very bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſoyle, but there is great plenty of Lead and Tin: their tongue is farre diſſonant from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, but it is much like to the Welſh tongue: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue many wordes common to both tongues. Cornwall is in the Dioceſſe of Exeſter, which was once worthy to bée counted the fourth part of the Iſland, for the contrarietie of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the particular deſcription of Britaine. The forme of the Iſland is <hi>Triquetra,</hi> hauing thrée corners, or thrée ſides: two whereof, that is to ſay, the corner toward the Eaſt, and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18437:10"/>
other toward the Weſt (both extending North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) are the longeſt. The third, which is the South ſide, is farre ſhorter then the other: for the Iſland is greater of length then of breadth. The right corner of which Iſland Eaſtward, is in Kent at Douer and Sandwich. From whence, to the third angle, which is in the North of Scotland, is ſeuen hundred miles. Againe, the length from this corner of Douer in Kent to the vttermoſt part of Cornwall, being S. <hi>Michaels</hi> mount, is ſuppoſed to be three hundred miles. From this left angle, being the Weſt part of Cornwall, which hath a proſpect towards Spaine, to the North angle in the further part of Scotland, the length is eight hundred miles.</p>
