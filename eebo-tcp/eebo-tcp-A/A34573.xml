            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a wonder to ſee how <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi>
predominate over <hi>Reaſon</hi> in Mankind;
Nothing is done, nothing ſaid, without ſome
tincture of either, or both. Even common
Occurrences are uſually related as Men would
have them to be, rather then as they are.
<hi>Plain-dealing</hi> is almoſt fled: And all things
now a days, whether Private or Publick,
Sacred or Prophane, are according to different Inclinations, without
regard to Truth, promiſcuouſly made the Subject of a <hi>Satyr</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negirick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An obvious example of this we have in the ſeveral accounts given of
the Tryal, Declaration, Demeanor, and Death of the late Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
concerning whoſe Tragedy, though acted for the moſt part in
the face of the whole Nation, yet there have flown about in a manner
as many, and thoſe contradictory <hi>Stories,</hi> as there are <hi>Relaters;</hi> and
ſuch as know <hi>leaſt,</hi> commonly talk <hi>moſt,</hi> to compleat the Error.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Printed Tryal ſet forth by Authority is no wiſe liable
to theſe groſs miſtakes; But it hath ſwelled in the Preſs, by
forms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To ſo vaſt a volume, that few can ſpare either money
to buy it, or time to read it. Beſides, it is in a manner ſilent of matters
chiefly deſigned for the Subject of this Treatiſe (<hi>viz.</hi>) My Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
Declaration, Devotion, Laſt Speech, and other Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which happened incluſively from the time of his Tryal, to his final
end.</p>
            <p>Having therefore attained to a moſt exact and certain knowledge
of theſe particulars, I ſhall for the ſatisfaction of the curious, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of Truth, give (together with an abſtract of the whole Tryal,
and ſome occurrences concerning it) a plain and ſincere relation of
what I know, and can by unqueſtionable Evidence juſtify to be true.
And herein I ſhall alſo totally abſtain from any the leſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> moralizing upon
tranſactions, whereby to <hi>foreſtal</hi> the Readers Judgment. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
my ſelf with a plain and candid Relation of things, as I find
them, leave every one to the freedom of his own <hi>cenſure</hi> and verdict
upon them.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>illiam Howard, Viſcount Stafford,</hi> was ſecond Son to
<hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and Uncle to the now Duke
of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> In his youth he was educated with all care
and induſtry imaginable to improve in him the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Nature and Grace. And to ſpeak truth, he
was ever held to be of a generous Diſpoſition, very
Charitable, Devout, addicted to Sobriety, inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
in his words, and a lover of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>When he arrived to years of maturity, he married <hi>Mary,</hi> deſcended
from the ancient Dukes of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Grandchild to <hi>Edward,</hi> and
Siſter, and ſole Heireſs to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Stafford;</hi> To whoſe Title he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
(being created by the late King <hi>Charles</hi> of Glorious memory)
Baron. <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. And ſoon after <hi>Viſcount Stafford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the time of the laſt bloody Rebellion, he ſuffer'd much for
<hi>his Loyalty</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> Always behaving himſelf with that courage
and conſtancy, as became a Nobleman, a good Chriſtian, and a faithful
Subject. After his preſent Majeſties joyful reſtauration, he lived in Peace,
Plenty, and Happineſs, Being bleſſed with a moſt Virtuous Lady to his
Wife, And many pious and dutiful Children. In which ſtate he remained
till the 66. year of his age, when happened this Revolution of his fortune,
as followeth.</p>

            <head>SECT. II. My Lords Impriſonment, Charge and Arraignment, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ABout <hi>Michaelmas Anno</hi> 1678. Mr. <hi>Titus Oates</hi> (formerly a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) accuſed upon Oath, before the
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> and not long after alſo before the two <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
ſeveral <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> ſome Perſons of Quality; (and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, the Lord <hi>Viſcount Stafford,</hi>) of High Treaſon, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
and deſigning the Death of the King, the introducing of <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and ſubverſion of the Government.</p>
            <p>My Lord, though he immediately heard of this Impeachment, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
(as he ſaid) on his own Innocence, never left his Family, nor
withdrew himſelf from his ordinary known Acquaintance and Affairs
till the 25th of <hi>October,</hi> (78.) when by Virtue of a Warrant from the
<hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> he was ſent Priſoner to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and from
thence, ſoon after to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he remained above two years
before he could be admitted to Tryal.</p>
            <p>During this interval, the whole Nation was ſurprized and allarm'd
with the noiſe of an <hi>horrid Plot,</hi> contriv'd by the <hi>Pope, Prieſts,</hi> and
<hi>Jeſuits,</hi> wherein, the King was to be murthered, Armies raiſed, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
Maſſacred, and the three Kingdoms deſtroyed, by Fire and
Sword, the People were affrighted, ſearches made, Guards doubled, and
all in an uproar. The King hereupon conſulted the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and
both Houſes declared it a <hi>Plot.</hi> Yet to ſtrengthen the Evidence (as yet,
but weak) and make farther diſcoveries; <hi>Indempnities</hi> are promiſed,
<hi>Rewards</hi> propoſed, and encouragements, given by <hi>Proclamation</hi> to any
who would make out upon Oath the particulars of what in ſubſtance was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48868:3"/>
already declar'd. By this, and the like ſedulity of the King, and three
ſucceeding Parliaments, ſeveral new Witneſſes came in; Firſt, Captain
<hi>Bedlow.</hi> Next <hi>Dugdale, Prance,</hi> and two others <hi>Bolron,</hi> and <hi>Mowbray,</hi>
out of the North; Then Mr. <hi>Jenniſon, Smith, Seigneur Franciſco Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield,

<hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Dugdale,</hi> gave Evidence againſt this Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> of
whom we now treat.</p>
            <p>After two years Impriſonment, when many <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> both
Prieſts and others, had been <hi>Executed,</hi> and moſt of the reſt <hi>Impriſoned</hi>
or fled; At length my Lord was brought to his Tryal, on the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> day
of <hi>Novem.</hi> 1680. at the <hi>Peers Bar</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
being preſent, and the Lord Chancellor <hi>High-Steward</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
The Impeachment was drawn in the name of the <hi>Commons of England.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tryal, p. 4.</note>
wherein my Lord was charged, together with other Papiſts, for having

in moſt Copious and Eloquent Language; And beginning firſt with the

on the expreſs <hi>Poſitive Oaths</hi> of the Witneſſes, upon whoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
the credit of this Plot chiefly depended. They amply dilated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Coleman,</hi> and others, clearly demonſtrating the buſie
Deſigns and Activity of the Writers. They preſſed home the execrable
Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> charged upon the Papiſts, as well by

by <hi>Dugdale</hi> to divers Gentlemen in <hi>Staſſordſhire,</hi> the third day
after the Murder was committed. They diſplayed to the full view the

would have ſuborned the <hi>Kings Evidence,</hi> and turn'd all their Guilt
upon His Majeſty's known and <hi>well-experienced Loyal Protestant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>
They urg'd the <hi>firing the City,</hi> the <hi>burning the Navy,</hi> the calling in

They anatomiz'd the wicked <hi>Principles</hi> (from whence ſpring evil Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices)

The <hi>Plot in general</hi> is directly charged upon the <hi>Papists in general,</hi>
and they muſt anſwer to the general Indictment; wherefore, though it
be not my Deſign to defend <hi>Popery,</hi> yet I think it very pertinent and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
before we enter upon my Lord's ſpecial Charge and Defenſion, to
inſert here ſome of thoſe many things the Papiſts in general often did,
and ſtill do conſtantly alledge againſt the Premiſſes, in vindication of
their Innocence. If in this I ſhall be accounted a Papiſt, or <hi>Popiſhly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi>
it will only be amongſt thoſe who love not to ſee <hi>Truth,</hi> contrary
to their <hi>Intereſt;</hi> not to do <hi>Juſtice,</hi> though to an <hi>Adverſary.</hi> To proceed
then.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts plead,<note place="margin">The Papiſts plea againſt the Plot in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note> That it is not the Clamour of the hainouſneſs and
horror of a Crime <hi>imputed,</hi> but the Guilt and clear Couviction of a Crime
<hi>proved,</hi> that renders a man accountable to <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and puniſhable by
the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That as <hi>Treaſon</hi> is the worſt of Crimes, ſo is the ſtain of <hi>Innocent Bloud</hi>
(ſhed by <hi>Perjury</hi>) hard to be waſhed off.</p>
               <p>That the bare <hi>poſitive Swearing</hi> of every perſon in every matter or
manner, hand over head, is no ſufficient Conviction of anothers Guilt;
for if ſo, it would be in the Power of any ſix Knights of the Poſt to kill
whomſoever they pleaſed, though never ſo Innocent; and for what
they pleaſed, though never ſo abſurd or impoſſible, by meer dint of
<hi>Affidavit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That falſe Accuſations may be ſo laid, as that the contrary cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be demonſtrated by the Party accuſed; ſeeing no mortal man can
diſtinctly prove where he was, and what he did, ſaid, or heard, every
day and every hour of his whole Life; Wherefore, to make <hi>juſtly</hi> valid
an Accuſation againſt another, the Laws of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> require,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Accuſer</hi> be a <hi>Credible Witneſs,</hi> that is, not tainted with
notorious Crimes or Villanies; for he that hath loſt a ſenſe of <hi>moral
Honeſty,</hi> hath loſt his right to <hi>moral Credit,</hi> and may be indifferently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to <hi>Swear any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Accuſation be ſtrengthened with <hi>probable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;</hi>
Circumſtances which bring along with them ſome appearance
of Truth, diſtinct from the bare Accuſation it ſelf; for otherwiſe, where
the Ballance is equal in point of repute, between the Accuſer and the
Accuſed, it is as preſumptive that the one ſhould be guilty of <hi>Perjury,</hi>
as the other of the <hi>Crimes</hi> charged upon him; And herein, the <hi>weaker</hi>
the Credit of the Accuſers are, the <hi>ſtronger</hi> ought the preſumption of
Circumſtances to be, as natural Reaſon and Juſtice dictate.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>neither</hi> of theſe two eſſential Conditions are found in the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
given of this <hi>pretended</hi> Plot.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt <hi>Condition;</hi> What manner of men the Witneſſes are who
make theſe Diſcoveries; how notoriouſly Infamous; how ſtigmatiz'd
with all ſorts of Felonies, Forgeries, Cheats, Debaucheries and Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,

ſeveral <hi>Courts of Judicature,</hi> can, upon <hi>Record</hi> give publick Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond <hi>condition;</hi> there are not only no <hi>Circumſtances</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
the bare Oaths; But the whole ſeries of the Evidence, is a
meer bundle of Moral impoſibilities, contradictions, aud nonſence.
Here is a <hi>Plot</hi> (forſooth) contrived by the Papiſts, at a time when

by whoſe merciful indulgence they lived in Peace; To wade through

To <hi>overthrow</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> for the reſtabliſhing of which they ſo frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the late Wars expoſed their <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>for tunes;</hi> This Plot muſt be
managed by <hi>Perſons</hi> of Quality, moſt remarkable peradventure of all
others for <hi>firmneſs of Loyalty,</hi> and now through age and infirmities,
retired from publick buſineſs and weary of the world; The whole
body of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> (men, before this hour, of known worth,
vertue, integrity, and unblemiſhed Reputation,) muſt all be involved
by <hi>Vows,</hi> and <hi>Sacrements,</hi> in a <hi>deſign</hi> ſo black, and execrable, That <hi>God</hi>

to be <hi>raiſed;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 70.</note> Theſe numberleſs Swarms, were to be provided with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
ſtores of <hi>Weapons, Ammunitions,</hi> &amp;c. and all in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for a general Maſſacre of Proteſtants at an hours warning; <hi>Oates</hi>
and the reſt likewiſe affirm they were well acquainted with all the moſt
deep, and ſecret <hi>intrigues</hi> the Papiſts had, of this nature; Yet after
all, when it comes to it; They cannot ſhew or direct where theſe Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of men, and Mountains of Magazines are; The Kings Officers, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thirty months diligent ſcrutiny, could never find the leaſt footſteps
of any ſuch thing. And 'tis impoſible they ſhould or could be inviſibly
diſperſed or conveyed away upon ſo ſuddain and unexpected a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
eſpecially in the very nick of time when they were to be made
uſe on.</p>

Military <hi>Offices;</hi> my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> (becauſe no good Accountant)
muſt be <hi>Paymaſter General;</hi> Divers <hi>Patents</hi> granted for dignities of
State; many <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Breifs</hi> for Eccleſiaſtical preferments; And God

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48868:6"/>
moſt <hi>damnable Treaſon,</hi> ſent nevertheleſs up and down at randam, ſome
by the <hi>Common Poſt.</hi> Others by ſuch Meſſengers as <hi>Oates, Bedlow,
Dugdale and Dangerfield,</hi> who, as boſom Councellours, were ſtill
privy to the contents of what they carried too and fro, and became ſo
dexterous in taking <hi>remarques,</hi> That they could exactly tell (when
their memories failed not for fear of contradictions) the particular
Dates, when, where, to whom, and from whom; Nay they could
punctually recite upon their ſingers ends, the very expreſs words of
almoſt every Letter; <hi>Oates</hi> moreover declares, he was never a real
Catholick, but only pretended to be ſo,<note place="margin">Page 123.</note> on purpoſe to make <hi>Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi>
And he was ſo ſucceſsful in this <hi>Stratagem,</hi> that he gained from the
Jeſuits a <hi>Patent</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Coleman's</hi> Tryal.</note> to be taken into the <hi>Conſult.</hi> Is it poſſible then, that
none of theſe men thus circumſtanced, could get or preſerve one ſingle
<hi>Letter,</hi> one ſealed <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> one ſcrip of Paper, one Original Writing,
(a thouſand manner of ways eaſily compaſſed in ſuch a conjuncture)
whereby to credit their <hi>monſtrous Evidence?</hi> How came it about they
did not at the firſt Diſcovery (having both time and opportunity to do
it) ſeize by ſurprize ſome of theſe <hi>Things,</hi> together with the <hi>Perſons,</hi>
where they were lodged? Did all the <hi>Plotters</hi> burn their <hi>Commiſſions,
Bulls, and Briefs,</hi> as well as their Letters, as ſoon as they received them?
Why did not <hi>Oates</hi> ſhew us at leaſt his own <hi>Patent</hi> received from the
<hi>Jeſuits?</hi> Surely it would have been of mighty force to ſtrengthen his
<hi>Teſtimony.</hi> Why did not the other <hi>Witneſſes</hi> alſo produce ſome of thoſe
<hi>Treaſonable Letters,</hi> writ, (as they ſaid,) and directed to themſelves?
Nothing appear; nothing extant; nothing feiſible, but a few naked,
harmleſs men, in their ſeveral private Chambers? And this too, juſt when
the <hi>Grand Deſign</hi> was to break into Action? What mortal man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
theſe endleſs <hi>Contradictions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe, and other the like grounds, the Papiſts would infer, That
no credit ought to be given to the <hi>bare Oaths</hi> of theſe men, ſwearing at
this wild <hi>incoherent</hi> rate. And they farther appeal to the Judgment of
every impartial conſcientious man, Whether it be not more likely that a
few <hi>Debauch'd</hi> Wretches, of <hi>lost</hi> Conſciences, and <hi>deſperate</hi> Fortunes,
<hi>allured</hi> by <hi>Gain,</hi> and <hi>encouraged</hi> by <hi>Indempnities,</hi> ſhould be induced
out of <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Intereſt,</hi> to ſwear a <hi>Lie;</hi> then that ſo many, ſo Noble,
ſo Prudent, ſo known Loyal and Virtuous Perſons, ſhould be guilty of ſo
horrid, ſo <hi>bloudy,</hi> ſo abſurd, ſo morally <hi>impoſſible,</hi> and (in all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
contradictory a <hi>Deſign?</hi> Nay whether, if ſuch Evidence be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and countenanced, any man, either <hi>Papiſt</hi> or <hi>Protestant,</hi> can be
long <hi>ſecure</hi> of his Reputation, Fortune, or <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To what was argued from the acknowledged Letters of Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coleman's</hi> Letters.</note>
and others; It is anſwered, That thoſe <hi>Letters</hi> indeed manifeſtly denote
the buſie Deſigns and <hi>Activity</hi> of the Writers; yet are they withal ſo far
from confirming a <hi>Plot,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Oates</hi> and his Companions pretend to
<hi>diſcover,</hi> that they directly evince the contrary. For, the whole ſubject
and context of thoſe <hi>Letters</hi> bear a plain and open face of what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
intended; And the Writers were Perſons, who, (had there been a
<hi>Plot.</hi>) were the moſt likely of all others to have been the main Engines
and <hi>Contrivers</hi> of it: Nevertheleſs, we do not find one ſingle world or
ſillable in them, from whence may be gathered any ſuch deſign; The
<hi>ſubſtance</hi> of them being only ſome imaginary <hi>Conceits,</hi> and over-weening
Policies of four or five aſpiring men, willing to be <hi>Great,</hi> or at leaſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48868:7"/>
to be <hi>thought ſo;</hi> and deſiring perhaps, in ſome meaſure, a liberty of
Conſcience; yet without confronting, much leſs deſtroying the <hi>King</hi>
or <hi>Government.</hi> Wherein alſo (as far as appeareth by the Letters)
they were nowiſe ſeconded by the <hi>Catholicks</hi> in general, nor much
countenanced by thoſe whoſe <hi>Favorites</hi> they pretended to be; ſo that,
upon the whole matter, theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> rightly conſidered, are rather (as
is ſaid before) a manifeſt <hi>Vindication</hi> of the Roman Catholicks <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi>
then a Confirmation of the <hi>Plot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the Death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> there is nothing to
faſten that Murder on the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> but the <hi>bare</hi> improbable
(though gainful) <hi>Oathes</hi> of two <hi>Infamous</hi> Perſons: The one (<hi>viz.)
Bedlow,</hi> notorious for <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Miſdemeanours:</hi> The other (<hi>viz.)
Prance, ſelf Condemned</hi> of <hi>Falſhood</hi> herein, by the teſtimony of his own
Mouth; for he once <hi>Swore</hi> he was an Actor in the ſaid <hi>Murder;</hi> and
ſoon after before the <hi>King and Council, unſwore</hi> what he had ſaid, and
Proteſted upon his Salvation, <hi>he knew nothing of it.</hi> There are further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
ſome remarkable and preſſing circumſtances, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
urge in their own <hi>defence</hi> herein; One is, that Sir <hi>Edmnndbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
was eſteemed by all, a moderate man, and particularly <hi>Indulgent</hi>
to <hi>Catholicks.</hi> And 'tis not credible the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would Murder their
<hi>Friends;</hi> eſpecially in a conjuncture of time, when it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
not could any ways <hi>Stifle the Diſcovery of the Plot</hi> already
made; Nay, when they could not but ſee ſuch an <hi>Horrid</hi> Action,
(if known) muſt needs draw the <hi>wrath</hi> and deteſtation of the whole
<hi>Nation</hi> upon them. The other is, that the whole (though premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated)
ſeries of this Murder,<note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> as it is related by the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> ſeems to
be involved with innumerable Abſurdities, Contradictions, moral Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities,
and Pregnant appearences of <hi>Perjury.</hi> The <hi>Scene</hi> of the
<hi>Tragedy</hi> muſt be (forſooth) the publick <hi>Yard</hi> of <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> (a
place, or rather thorow-fare, of continual intercourſe) within twenty
Paces of the Common <hi>Guards,</hi> where Watch is kept night and day;
The <hi>Aſſaſſines,</hi> to effect their deſign, muſt feign a Quarrel, and call
<hi>Juſtice Godfrey</hi> out of the Street (a notable Policy) to keep the Peace,
though none, Paſſengers, Soldiers or Neighbours, perceived any
thing of this Tumult. When they had him in the Yard, they Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
him with an <hi>Hankerchief,</hi> (a very proper Inſtrument, ſtudyed
and contrived before-hand, to ſtrangle a Man.) After the buſineſs
was done, they let him lie expoſed in this open place, half living,
half dead, above a quarter of an hour. At length they dragged him
into a Chamber in Doctor <hi>Godwin</hi>'s Lodgings (a Room atteſted to be
of daily uſe to the Servants, never lock'd, but conſtantly obvious to
all Comers and Goers;) here they kept him two days, and then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
him through ſeveral Courts, into ſeveral Rooms, and Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe;</hi> And having thus (to no purpoſe) toſſed him
up and down from <hi>Saturday</hi> till <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> they finally placed him
(though ſtiff and Inflexible) in a <hi>Sedan,</hi> and carryed him to the <hi>Soho,</hi>
and there ſet him aſtride on Horſe-back, to ride before <hi>Hill</hi> to the
place where he was afterwards found. <hi>Bedlow</hi> depoſeth Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Godfrey</hi> was <hi>Throtl'd</hi> with a <hi>Cravat; Prance</hi> Swears it was with
an <hi>Handkerchief;</hi> The names of the Aſſaſſines cited by <hi>Bedlow,</hi> are
<hi>Prichard, Welſh, Le Phaire, and other Jeſuits.</hi> But the Murderers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
<hi>by Prance, are Greene, Hill, Bury, Gyrald and Kelly;</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48868:7"/>
theſe two parties are quite different Actors; and as far as apears by
the Evidence, neither their Deſigns, nor Perſons well known to each
other. <hi>Prance</hi> ſaith, he ſaw the dead Body very plainly in a low
Room, by the light of a dark Lanthorn, but what was thrown over
it, he could not tell; Nor could he afterwards when required, go to
the Room where he ſaid he ſaw it. <hi>Bedlow</hi> tells us he refuſed to have
any hand in the <hi>Murder,</hi> for which cauſe the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> did not acquaint
him who it was; yet they ſhewed him the <hi>dead Body</hi> in the preſence
of many, who neither knew him, nor he them; <hi>Prance</hi> himſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declared, he never was in <hi>Bedlow</hi> company, till he came to
Priſon. The main Aſſaſſines were ignorant of what reward they
were to have; But <hi>Bedlow</hi> (though no compartner in the Murder,)
could tell there were Four Thouſand Pounds ordered, of which Two
Thouſand Pounds were proffered to him alone, if he would but aſſiſt
the reſt to convey away the Corps. This Murder is affirmed to have
been committed on <hi>Saturday,</hi> the twelfth day of <hi>October</hi> (78.) at nine
a clock at night; and the Body conveyed away on the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
about Midnight. In direct oppoſition to which, <hi>Hill, Green,</hi>
and <hi>Bury</hi> (who were Accuſed, Tryed and Executed for this Fact,) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
theſe Witneſſes. One Mrs. <hi>Tilden</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Broadſtreet,</hi> atteſted
that <hi>Hill</hi> (who dwelt with them) never kept ill hours, but always
came in by Eight of the Clock; That he could not go out afterwards,
becauſe he waited at Table, and the Maid <hi>Catherine Lee</hi> locked up the
doors, and the Family went not to Bed till Eleven; That particularly
he was at home on <hi>Saturday</hi> night, when Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> is ſaid
to be Kill'd; and on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> night when carried away. <hi>James
Warrier</hi> atteſted, That <hi>Green</hi> (his Lodger) was in his Houſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
on <hi>Saturday October</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> from ſeven till after ten at Night,
and that he exactly remembred it by his Work. The three Centinels,
who Succeſſively kept ſtrict Guard on the aforeſaid <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night,
at the great <hi>Gate</hi> at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> (through which 'tis affirmed the Body
was carried out in a <hi>Sedan</hi>) declared there went out that way no <hi>Sedan</hi>
at any hour whatſoever, from ſeven a Clock that Night, to four the
next Morning; The Amplitude of which Teſtimony includes at leaſt
three hours immediatly before and after the time Sworn to by <hi>Prance</hi>
and <hi>Bedlow. Eury</hi>'s Maid atteſted, That her Maſter came in that ſame
<hi>Wedneſday</hi> in the Dusk of the Evening; went to Bed about 12. and
could not well after that go out again, without her knowledge; the
paſſage to his Chamber being through hers. And it is moſt worthy of
obſervation, that this <hi>Bury</hi> was, and profeſſed himſelf to be (both du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Impriſonment, and at his very Death,) a <hi>Proteſtant of the Church
of England;</hi> Yet this Man, though after Condemnation he was proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Life, if he would own the Fact; Nevertheleſs abſolutely deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to his laſt Breath. And when the very Cart was drawing away
from under him, he lifted up his Hands and ſaid, <hi>As I am innocent, ſo
receive my Soul, O Jeſus;</hi> wherefore if the laſt Words of a dying <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi>
who might, but would not live, (by a falſe accuſation of himſelf
or others,) may be credited; The <hi>Papiſts</hi> were innocent of this <hi>Murder,</hi>
and the forenamed Witneſſes <hi>Perjured</hi> in their <hi>Evidence.</hi> As for what
is objected about a Letter ſent from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Tixall, &amp;c.</hi> It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
(ſuppoſing ſuch a Letter was really ſent and received) That a
Letter intimating the Murder of a Juſtice of the Peace, might well be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48868:8"/>
Writ from <hi>London</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> (when Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> was
known to be miſſing) and arrive at <hi>Tixall</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Poſt on <hi>Munday</hi> following;<note place="margin">Pag. 87.</note> And thereupon <hi>Dugdale</hi> might tell
the news the ſelf ſame day,<note place="margin">Pag. 136.</note> to divers Gentlemen at <hi>Tixall.</hi> What of
all this? Where's the Inference againſt the <hi>Papiſts?</hi> Yet this is all ſome
Gentlemen ſeemed to atteſt, (whilſt others denyed,) and all can be
neceſſarily deduced from the receipt of ſuch a Letter; But that this
Juſtice of the Peace was Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> and that the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
had Murdred him, is proved only by the Common tract of <hi>Dugdales</hi>
peremptory Swearing, without any rational motive of credibility. Thus

misfortune was, that arriving in <hi>England,</hi> he quite miſtook his Errand.
And though he continued firm in the belief of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine and
Principles; yet made it his whole buſineſs to root out the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> (the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48868:9"/>
                     <hi>Popes</hi> chief <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi>) and diſſwade <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> from ſending
Moneys to <hi>Colledges</hi> beyond Seas.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dugdale</hi> tells us, All the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Letters containing Damnable Treaſon,
and ſent for the moſt part by the Common Poſt, came to his hands, moſt
of which he ſaw and read, but could never produce one ſingle Letter.
He informs us alſo of dreadful <hi>Oaths and Sacraments of Secrecy,</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
to the Conſpirators, before they were made privy to any
dangerous Deſign; yet with the ſame breath declares, there were
whole Armies both privy and ready, to a deſign no leſs then of <hi>Cutting</hi>
all the <hi>Protestants Throats,</hi> throughout the Nation at an hours war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Nay he aſſures us, there was a <hi>Free Pardon of all Sins</hi> Proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
every where, at the Chappels to all Perſons, Men and Women,
whoſoever would be active in <hi>Killing the King,</hi> (a notable way of
concealing Secrets.) Is it poſſible this fellow ſhould find credit in ſuch
groſs, ſuch palpable Forgeries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oates</hi> likewiſe relates, How that whilſt he was Chaplain to the Duke
of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the <hi>Priests</hi> attempted the utmoſt of their skill, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him out of his Religion, by telling him, <hi>The Church of</hi> England
<hi>was upon it's last Legs.</hi> Surely the <hi>Priests</hi> took him to be either a
notorious Fool or Knave, for otherwiſe they might doubtleſs have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
ſome more plauſible and leſs dangerous Argument to convert a
<hi>Proteſtant Miniſter;</hi> Yet he feigned to be convinced by their reaſons,
and was hereupon preſently entertained by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> (the ſottiſh
careleſs <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>) who on a ſuddain intruſted this <hi>Neophite</hi> with all their
concerns, made him privy to all their moſt Damnable Intrigues; And
in ſhort, 'tis moſt certain, nothing of <hi>Treaſon, Murder,</hi> or <hi>Villany,</hi>
was contrived or even thought on, by them, without him; By this
means he became acquainted, not only with the ſtrange adventures of
<hi>Pickerings looſe Flint, Whipping, Thirty Thouſand Maſſes,</hi> &amp;c. But alſo
with the manner of <hi>Firing the City,</hi> Introducing <hi>Chimerical Armies,
French, Iriſh, Spaniſh,</hi> &amp;c. Muſtered up in the Depoſition; Nor is it

(Alas good Man) It was to ſave His Majeſties life, made him ſeem to
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> what he really was not. Yet (O prodigious Impudence)
he owns at the ſame time, he was conſcious for above a year together,
of the daily attempts made by <hi>Groves</hi> and <hi>Pickering to Shoot the King;</hi>
He hourly expected for ſeveral Months the horrid effects of Sir <hi>George
Wakeman</hi>'s Poyſon;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Tryal.</note> He was privy (as he ad's elſe-where) to the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

actually upon the Place, and ready for the <hi>Villany;</hi> He ſaw the Money
ſent to them for their encouragement, and every moment waited to
hear, the <hi>fatal ſtroke</hi> was given. Nevertheleſs this Man of <hi>Conſcience,</hi>
whoſe watchful Eye ſo carefully guarded the King's <hi>Life,</hi> all this while
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48868:9"/>
made no Diſcovery; Though he knew for certain, that the <hi>Piſtols</hi> were
all ready, even at the King's <hi>Breast;</hi> The Cup of <hi>Poyſon</hi> at his <hi>Lips;</hi>
And the <hi>Dagger</hi> almoſt at his very <hi>Heart;</hi> Yet he never cryed out Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of theſe horrid Treaſons, until ſuch time as the King might have been
killed a thouſand times over. Is this the Doctors <hi>Vigilancy?</hi> Or rather,
is it not perfect Demonſtration, that all he hath Sworn of the <hi>Plot,</hi> is
damnable <hi>Perjury?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeniſon</hi> declares, that though he often expreſſed to Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> an
horrid deteſtation of Treaſon and Bloodſhed; Yet <hi>Ireland</hi> (as if he had
a mind to hang himſelf) was ſtill urging this conſcientious Man to <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the King;</hi> and when he could not prevail with him herein, he would
needs have him at laſt to nominate ſome <hi>Iriſh Ruffians,</hi> whom he judged
moſt proper for this Execrable Villany. And thus far indeed <hi>Jeniſon</hi>
acknowledgeth, he condeſcended. Now one would think a Man, who
had taken ſo deep an Impreſſion of horrour and deteſtation of Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
ſhould have had ſome ſcruple in concealing ſo Helliſh a Deſign;
and much more in nominating the very perſons who were to effect it.
But that which ſeems above all moſt ſtrange is, the mighty reward the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> proffered him, in caſe he would joyn with the Four <hi>Ruffians,</hi>
in this Deviliſh enterprize. <hi>Oates</hi> informs us, Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was to
have <hi>fifteen thouſand pounds to Poyſon the King,</hi> and <hi>Groves fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
for Shooting Him. Dugdale</hi> alſo aſſures us, he had not much leſs
promiſed for the like attempt; Yet when theſe <hi>Jeſuits</hi> come to beat
the Price with <hi>Jeniſon</hi> (though a Man hard to be wrought upon) they
could afford him no more then <hi>twenty pounds;</hi> and this only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
of an Old Debt; a wonderful encouragement to a Scrupulous
Man, for ſo deſperate and damned an Exploit.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this whole matter, The <hi>Papists</hi> aver, if the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and
<hi>Equity</hi> of their Cauſe be impartially conſidered, the <hi>Integrity</hi> of their
Principles rightly underſtood, their formerly <hi>experienced Loyalty</hi> regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
The contrary practices of their chiefeſt <hi>Adverſaries</hi> remembered.
The <hi>Infamy</hi> of the Witneſſes, and <hi>Inconſistancy</hi> of their Evidence duly
weighed, there will remain no colour of proof, or even Suſpicion of
this fatal <hi>Plot,</hi> which hath already drawn ſo much Innocent Blood, and
brought no ſmall confuſion both to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>

               <p>Then they began by way of introduction to ſhew, that they had

                  <note place="margin">The firſt onſet againſt My Lord.</note> That this <hi>Plot</hi> was a general <hi>deſign</hi> of the
<hi>Popiſh party;</hi> That it was not likely ſuch a deſign could be carried on,
without the Concurrence of Perſons of great <hi>Quality.</hi> That therefore
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48868:10"/>
it was to be preſumed, my <hi>Lord</hi> at the Bar, a Nobleman, and a Zealous
<hi>Papiſt</hi> had a ſhare in it; But what that ſhare was, and how far my
Lord was engaged, was to appear from the poſitive Evidence.</p>
               <p>It will not be expected that my Lord, one ſingle Perſon of 68. years
of age, long impriſoned, no great Rhetorician, nor much verſed in the
<hi>Law,</hi> ſhould take all advantages, improve favourable circumſtances, and
keep equal meaſures, in ſharpneſs of Wit, and effluence of Speech, with
his Opponents, who were ten or twelve of the greateſt <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and
ableſt Judgments of the Nation; Nor is it any wonder, if my Lord
confounded with the multiplicity of arguments; aſtoniſhed at the
horrour of the objected Crimes, diſcountenanced by the Auditory;
And (as he acknowledged) half ſtupified with continual pleading,
day after day, without intermiſſion; Did ſometimes inſiſt upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of leſs, and omit matters of greater moment, in his own behalf;

               <p>

                     </note> he ever from his heart

all <hi>Plots</hi> againſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> He abjured all <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
leading to ſuch ends; And diſowned all Authority upon Earth,
which might in the leaſt pretend to abſolve him from his <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
He further ſhewed how faithful and affectionate he had been, both
to the late <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>Wars,</hi> and to this in his Exile; He declared he
had timely notice of his being Impeached, and thereupon might (if he
would) have eaſily fled; He likewiſe acknowledged, That after he
was in the <hi>Tower,</hi> both the King and the <hi>Houſe</hi> of Lords had ſent him
word, <hi>That in caſe he would make a Diſcovery, though he were never ſo
Guilty he ſhould have a Pardon;</hi> If therefore he had been really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of his own Guilt, and might have ſecured himſelf by either of
theſe means, and would not, he ought to dye for his folly, as well
as his Crime. He profeſſed he had always a natural abhorrence of

revenged on my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> becauſe he would not own him for his Servant, when Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted

my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> but againſt my Lord <hi>Aſton;</hi> It is Impertinent to be urged againſt
<hi>Dugdale</hi>'s preſent Evidence.</p>
                  <p>To which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Anſwer. <hi>To the firſt,</hi> It is no wonder, if at a time when <hi>Roman
Catholicks</hi> were univerſally ſuſpected and perſecuted on account of the <hi>Plot; Dugdale</hi>
though not Conſcious of any Guilt, either in himſelf or others; Yet being then a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi>
and hitherto undetermined to <hi>ſet up</hi> for an Evidence, was in ſome appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of comming into trouble, and might therefore withdraw upon that Score.
But what is that to the preſent purpoſe? Is it not alſo undeniably proved here.
That <hi>Dugdale</hi> was in Debt: That for <hi>Debt</hi> he was Arreſted and Impriſoned: That
for his <hi>Miſdemeanors,</hi> and not for <hi>Religion</hi> he was diſcarded by his Maſter; That at
laſt <hi>Beggery</hi> had ſurrounded him, <hi>Revenge</hi> poſſeſſed him, and <hi>Deſperation</hi> Seized him.
If this hath been clearly proved, 'tis no hard matter to judge what was his end and
aim in making his <hi>Diſcoveries;</hi> And my Lords further Inferences hereupon are

                     <hi>To the ſecond,</hi> The Evidence given of <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Revenge, was not
produced as if the ſaid Revenge was chiefly intended againſt my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> but
only to ſhew that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was now upon the point of bidding adieu to Conſcience
and Honeſty, And deſirous to ſatiſfie at once, both his Malice, and Penury; He
contrived his <hi>Plot</hi> (after the Model given him by <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi>) wherein
he Accuſed ſome out of <hi>Revenge,</hi> and others, (amongſt whom my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>)
as the moſt proper Perſons, to compleat the Number of <hi>Actors</hi> in his Tragick
<hi>Farce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN defence of <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Reputation in point of Honeſty.<note place="margin">Pag.147.</note> Mr.
<hi>Whitby</hi> declared, That <hi>Dugdale</hi> had been long my Lord
<hi>Aſton</hi>'s Servant, received my Lord's Rents, made his Bargains, and
Governed the reſt of the Family: That he dealt honeſtly with him;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48868:11"/>
That he had heard indeed ſome Trades-men complain he put them off
without Money, and would not pay them: But that my Lord would
hear nothing againſt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Southal</hi> a Coroner depoſed, that he knew no ill of Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
that he was the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Bayliff, and had a good repute
with all thoſe People who had dependence on the Family; But that
he himſelf never had any buſineſs with him. Then he (the ſaid <hi>Southal</hi>)
gave a large relation how he had perſwaded <hi>Dugdale</hi> (being then in
Cuſtody for Debt) to Diſcover the <hi>Plot;</hi> By putting him in mind of
his Duty and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the King; and aſſuring him, <hi>If he would make
a timely Diſcovery, he ſhould not only obtain his Majeſties Gracious
Paerdon, but alſo a Reward of</hi> Two Hundred Ponnds. By force of which
Argument, <hi>Dugdale</hi> at laſt aſſented to make Diſcoveries; And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
gave in his ſeveral <hi>Depoſitions,</hi> firſt in the Countrey before two
Juſtices of the Peace, afterwards before the <hi>Councel;</hi> and laſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the two <hi>Houſes of Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning this <hi>Southal,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ferrers</hi> informed the Court,<note place="margin">Pag. 163.</note> That
he had been very active againſt the <hi>King</hi> in the late <hi>Wars,</hi> and had the
Repute of a <hi>Pernicious</hi> Man againſt the <hi>Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Impugne which Information, the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> declared in behalf
of <hi>Southal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 168.</note> that his Mother had imployed him, and found him honeſt
in their Affairs; And Mr. <hi>Gower</hi> farther teſtified, That he found
<hi>Southal</hi> extraordinarily zealous in proſecuting the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>UPon theſe Evidences, the <hi>Mannagers</hi> made theſe Obſervations, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Whitby</hi> not only declares, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> had dealt honeſtly by him; But
that my Lord <hi>Aston</hi> himſelf would hear nothing againſt him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is
not always the Stewards fault, if Workmen to great Perſons ſometimes want
their Wages. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Southal</hi> an underſtanding and zealous man, had
(with much difficulty and ſtrong Arguments,) the good fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at laſt to ſucceed,
in parſwading Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to make a fair and plain Diſcovery of the whole
<hi>Plot,</hi> to the great happineſs, not only of Mr. <hi>Dugaale,</hi> but of the whole
<hi>Nation</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Anſwer: <hi>To the firſt,</hi> Though <hi>Dugdale</hi> perhaps dealt
honeſtly with Mr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> yet he might be a Knave, and deal diſhoneſtly with
other People for all that. And if my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> refuſed to hear any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, this very refuſal argues there were Complaints made of him; And
my Lord himſelf, in time both gave Ear to his Crimes, and Diſcarded him
for them, as is already proved. <hi>To the ſecond,</hi> Thoſe Stowards who receiving
Moneys of their Maſters, to pay <hi>poor Labourers their Wages,</hi> ſhall (as <hi>Dugdale</hi>
did) <hi>Defrand them of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the better to defray their own Extravagant Expences,
are no honeſt Men. <hi>To the third,</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> do not underſtand, to what
purpoſe this Teſtimony of <hi>Southal</hi>'s is here produced; for it is granted, That
<hi>Dugdale</hi> being in Goal, and brought to extremity, did after much ſtruggling
and reluctancy of Conſcience, abandon his Soul to <hi>Perjury;</hi> And conceiving
fair hopes of Succeſs, by the proſperous adventures of <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow,</hi> by the
preſent promiſe of 200 <hi>l.</hi> and by the perſwaſion of <hi>Southal,</hi> a notorious <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wellian,</hi>
at laſt plunged himſelf into deep and horrid <hi>Oaths,</hi> not only incredible,
but morally impoſſible to be true.</p>
                  <p>THe ſecond weighty <hi>Exception</hi> made by my Lord againſt <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s
<hi>Depoſition was,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Perjury.</note> That he had directly and palpably <hi>Perjured
himſelf,</hi> in divers parts and circumſtances of his ſaid <hi>Depoſition.</hi> For
inſtance of this,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Dugdale</hi> now Swears, He had an exact knowledge, and deep
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48868:12"/>
concern in the <hi>Plot.</hi> He was not only a <hi>Confident,</hi> but an <hi>Aſſiſtant</hi> in
raiſing <hi>Armies, Killing the King,</hi> &amp;c. Now my Lord proved by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Irrefragable Witneſſes; <hi>That the ſaid</hi> Dugdale <hi>had before at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
times, and on ſundry occaſions, with dreadful</hi> Oaths <hi>and</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations,
<hi>profeſſed he knew nothing of any ſuch thing.</hi> The Witneſſes
were theſe.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Walter Baggot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kinnerſley,</hi> both Parliament-men,<note place="margin">Pag. 87. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> Atteſted;
That <hi>Dugdale</hi> being Examined before them, and other Juſtices of the
Peace, though he then took the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance and Supremacy</hi> in
their Preſence, yet abſolutely denyed any knowledge of the Plot.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Whitgrave</hi> alſo a Juſtice of the Peace, Atteſted, that he earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Preſſed and Encouraged <hi>Dugdale</hi> to make a Diſcovery of what he
knew; telling him, <hi>Now he had taken the Oaths, they looked upon him
as one of them; and that he would do him all the Kindneſs he could:</hi> To
which <hi>Dugdale</hi> anſwered, <hi>Truly for his part, though he had the misfortune
to Live amongſt</hi> Papiſts, <hi>yet he never liked their Religion.</hi> Then Mr.
<hi>Whitgrave</hi> urged him home, ſaying, <hi>Sir you may do your ſelf a kindneſs,
and oblige your King and Country: I am confident you know of this Horrid
Plot; pray do not ſtifle your Conſcience with an</hi> Oath of Secrecy: <hi>Let it
come out; Dugdale</hi> replyed, <hi>as he hoped to be ſaved, be knew nothing
of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Sawyer</hi> Atteſted, That two or three days before <hi>Dugdale</hi>
began to Impeach, being then at <hi>Stafford</hi> under the Serjeants Hands
for Debt, he took a Glaſs of Drink in the preſence of <hi>Sawyer,</hi> and
ſaid, Thomas, <hi>I wiſh this may be my Damnation, and my Poiſon, if I
know of any Plot or Prieſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>UPon theſe Evidences the Mannagers made this Obſervation,<note place="margin">Pag. 175.</note> (<hi>viz.) That</hi>
Dugdale<hi>'s denying, and with Execrations forſwearing any knowledge of the</hi>
Plot, <hi>is no manner of Objection; for he Forſwore it at a time, when he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to reveal it, and was in danger of his own Life; but afterwards he changed his
mind, and diſcovered all to</hi> Southal, <hi>and others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which the</hi> Papiſts <hi>anſwer:</hi> It is very ſtrange, ſo <hi>palpable</hi> a Perjury proved
upon <hi>Dugdale</hi> by ſo <hi>Subſtantial</hi> Witneſſes, in the whole Syſtem and Eſſence of
his Teſtimony, ſhould be ſo ſlightly evaded. Is it no manner of Objection to
prove that <hi>Dugdale</hi> is Forſworn in his whole Diſcovery? Muſt Credit be given
to the Depoſitions of a man, in a matter, whereof he himſelf with dreadful <hi>Oaths</hi>
and <hi>Execrations</hi> hath often proteſted the contrary? Is the Conviction of Perjury
by the Teſtimony of his <hi>own Mouth</hi> nothing? Why? becauſe out of fear in his
former <hi>Oaths,</hi> he <hi>never intended</hi> to Swear Truth. Is this a Rational anſwer? Nay
is it not rather perfectly demonſtrative from what is already proved; that for
Fear, for Lucre, for Revenge, for Liberty, this man hath actually Sworn to
expreſs <hi>Coniradictions,</hi> and will not ſtick upon the ſame motives to Swear any
thing.</p>
                  <p>SEcondly, <hi>Dugdale</hi> had determinately Sworn at Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi>'s
Tryal (as my Lord proved by two Subſtantial Witneſſes,<note place="margin">Pag. 74.</note> the
Lady <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and Madam <hi>Howard</hi>) that the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Conſult at <hi>Tixal,</hi> mentioned in the Depoſition, wherein my Lord
is ſaid to have been preſent, and Conſenting to the Killing of the <hi>King;</hi>
was held preciſely in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> (78.) Now my Lord proved
he never was at or near <hi>Tixal</hi> during that whole Month; nor came
thither till the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> following. This he ſhewed by giving
an exact Account where he was, every Week and Day throughout
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48868:12"/>
that Month. The Witneſſes who gave reſpective Evidence to each
particular time and place, were, the Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bonny, White</hi> and <hi>Bevan,</hi> Servants to the
ſaid Marqueſs.</p>
                  <p>UPon thoſe Teſtimonies,<note place="margin">page 147.</note> the Mannagers made theſe Obſervations: <hi>Firſt, The
two Ladies who gave Evidence to</hi> Dugdale's <hi>words ſpoken at Sir</hi> George
Wakeman's <hi>Tryal, were</hi> Roman Catholicks <hi>and Relations to my Lord. Secondly, They
did not agree in their Evidence with one another. The Lady Marchioneſs ſaying,
Dugdale</hi> Swore that my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was to come down into <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> in
<hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> and was preſent at the Conſult at <hi>Tixal</hi> in <hi>Auguſt. Madam</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>ſaying, Dugdale</hi> Swore my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> did come down into <hi>Stafforaſhire</hi>
in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July;</hi> and was preſent at the Conſult at <hi>Tixal</hi> in <hi>Auguſt. Thirdly, The
ſaid Ladies having much concern upon them for Sir</hi> George Wakeman <hi>the Popiſh
Phyſitian, they might eaſily miſtake in what they heard. Fourthly, in the</hi> Printed
Tryal; <hi>There are no ſuch words of</hi> Dugdale's <hi>mentioned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which the Papiſts anſwer:</hi> To the firſt, The two Ladies, though <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi>
are perſons of that Quality and known Vertue, as admit of no Compariſon
in point of Credit with the Witneſſes produced againſt my Lord. That to Vilify
my Lord's Witneſſes becauſe <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> is contrary to Law, and denotes
an Exaſperated mind, willing to deprive <hi>Catholicks</hi> of a Juſt Defence. To the
ſecond, The different manner or Phraſe the Ladies uſed in expreſſing themſelves
in point of Circumſtance, is not at all material, ſeeing they both joyntly agree,
and determinately Atteſt; <hi>That</hi> Dugdale <hi>Swore my Lord was at</hi> Tixal <hi>in</hi> Auguſt,
<hi>and then and there preſent at the Conſult.</hi> Which was the Subſtantial thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
my Lord proveth him Perjured. To the Third, A deep concern occaſioneth
an Attention rather then a Miſtake: And a pretence of a miſtake in a poſitive
Witneſs, is an Evaſion, whereby any Verbal Teſtimony whatſoever may be
eluded. To the Fourth, <hi>Catholicks</hi> have Experience that many conſiderable
matters have been omitted, or otherwiſe inſerted in the <hi>Printed Tryals,</hi> to the
diſadvantage of their Cauſe: And as thoſe Printed Copies, though pleaded, were
never allowed to be good Evidence for them, ſo ought they not to be alledged
againſt them.</p>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Dugdale</hi> Swears in his Depoſition: That at <hi>Tixal</hi> on the
<hi>20th.</hi> or <hi>21th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> (78.) My Lord ſent for him by one
of his Servants to his Chamber, in the Morning whilſt he was Dreſſing;
(which Servant alſo <hi>Dugdale</hi> Swears, was either Mr. <hi>Furneſſe</hi> my Lords
Gentleman, or <hi>George Leigh</hi> his Page:) And that when <hi>Dugdale</hi> came
into the Chamber, my Lord ſent out his ſaid Servants; and being thus
with him alone, <hi>Offered him five hundred Pounds to Kill the King.</hi> In
direct oppoſition to theſe particulars, my Lord proved, by the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
of the ſelf ſame Servants, Mr. <hi>Furneſſe</hi> and <hi>George Leigh;</hi> that
he never ſent for <hi>Dugdale,</hi> never was with him alone in his Chamber;
nor never diſmiſſed his Servants for that end, all that Morning. For
the evincing of which,</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Furneſſe</hi> my Lords Gentleman Atteſted:<note place="margin">page. 80, <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                     </note> That he about eight a
Clock that Morning, coming to my Lords Chamber, met <hi>Dugdale</hi> in the
Hall. <hi>Dugdale</hi> deſired him he would Intreat my Lord to Intercede to the
Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> his Maſter in his behalf, that he might go to <hi>Etching</hi> Race:
Hereupon <hi>Furneſſe</hi> went into my Lords Chamber, and having ſpoken
to my Lord, as <hi>Dugdale</hi> deſired, my Lord bid him be called in; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<hi>Furneſſe</hi> conducted <hi>Dugdale</hi> into the Chamber; when he
came in, my Lord asked him ſeveral queſtions about the Race, telling
him, he himſelf would bett Twenty Pounds for <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> ſake; Then,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48868:13"/>
after ſome diſcourſe to this purpoſe, my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> told him, he
would ſpeak to his Lord for him; during all which time <hi>Furneſſe</hi> was
preſent in the Chamber, together with my Lord and <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and heard
the diſcourſe between them. When <hi>Dugdale</hi> had obtained his requeſt,
he went out of my Lord's Chamber, leaving <hi>Furneſſe</hi> ſtill there; my
Lord alſo as ſoon as he was dreſt went out of his Chamber to my Lord
<hi>Aſton,</hi> to ask him leave for <hi>Dugdale;</hi> bidding <hi>Furneſſe</hi> make himſelf
ready to go to the Race. <hi>Furneſſe</hi> accordingly made himſelf ready
about Nine a Clock, and coming down the Back-ſtairs my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>
met him: Go (ſaith he) to <hi>Etching-hill,</hi> and ſee what Betts there are,
and take <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> along with you to ſhew you the way, for I
have asked his Lord leave for him to go: Upon this <hi>Dugdale</hi> having
now leave, went along with <hi>Furneſſe</hi> to the Stable, and took Horſe;
<hi>Furneſſe</hi> his Horſe was not ready, but he overtook <hi>Dugdale</hi> within half
a Mile, and they arrived at the Race together about twelve a Clock:
My Lord himſelf (with other perſons of Quality) came to the Race
not long after, and returned back to <hi>Tixal</hi> about ſeven at Night.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Mr. <hi>Furneſſe</hi> and <hi>George Leigh</hi> both Atteſted, that my
Lord never ſent either of them for <hi>Dugdale;</hi> that he never bid them
go out of the Chamber, or abſent themſelves whilſt <hi>Dugdale</hi> alone
remained with him: No, nor did they know that my Lord was ever
alone with <hi>Dugdale,</hi> either that Morning, or in his whole Life.</p>
                  <p>To Infringe the laſt Particle of this laſt Evidence, the Mannagers
produced theſe Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Hanſon</hi> Depoſed;<note place="margin">Page 132, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> That he once ſaw <hi>Dugdale</hi> with my Lord in

or not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Anſell</hi> Depoſed, That paſſing through the Court at <hi>Tixal,</hi>
he ſaw my Lord walking with <hi>Dugdale;</hi> That he heard no Diſcourſe
between them; That there might be more in the Company, but he
ſaw no more: And laſtly added, that talking one day with <hi>Dugdale</hi>
about the Plot, <hi>Dugdale</hi> anſwered: <hi>God Blaſt him if he knew any thing
of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>UPon theſe Evidences the <hi>Mannagers</hi> made theſe Obſervations.<note place="margin">Page 174.</note> 
                     <hi>Firſt, My Lords
two Witneſſes,</hi> Furneſs <hi>and</hi> Leigh, <hi>were his own Servants. Secondly, They were very
poſitive in a matter hard to remember,</hi> (viz) That <hi>Dugdale</hi> never was in my Lords
Company: <hi>And therefore that eaſie Credit ſhould not be given to them, but rather
to</hi> Hanſon <hi>and</hi> Anſell, <hi>who both Swear, that they have ſeen my Lord and</hi> Dugdale
<hi>together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which the Papiſts anſwer:</hi> Theſe common Sophiſmes and weak Objections
made to the Convincing Evidence here given by my Lord in Confutation of the
main matter laid to his Charge, argue the Mannagers at a loſs for an Anſwer. To
the firſt, Whom could my Lord produce but his Servants, to contradict the Falſities
of a man that pretends to have heard him ſpeak <hi>Treaſon</hi> whilſt he was Dreſſing
in his Bed-Chamber? Are Poneſt Servants, becauſe Servants no good Witneſſes?
To the ſecond; Though it ſhould be granted that at other times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon other
occaſions, <hi>Dugdale</hi> might have been in my Lord's Company, either unknown to
his Servants, or not remembred by them, or even by my Lord himſelf, (which
is the utmoſt of what the Teſtimony of <hi>Hanſon</hi> and <hi>Anſell</hi> can amount to) yet
this doth not at all weaken my Lord's Evidence, nor clear <hi>Dugdale</hi> from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
herein: For the chief things which my Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s two Servants well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
diſtinctly Atteſted, and by moſt remarkable Circumſtances fully proved;
was, That my Lord did not ſend either of them for <hi>Dugdale;</hi> nor was <hi>Dugdale</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48868:13"/>
alone with my Lord in his Chamber, on the <hi>21th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> of <hi>September</hi> in the Morning:
On all which particulars <hi>Dugdale</hi> laid the Streſs of his Evidence; and here it is,
he is directly <hi>Perjured.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOurthly <hi>Dugdale</hi> at the forenamed Tryal of Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi>
poſitively Swore (as my Lord proved by two Witneſſes, Mr.
<hi>Gyfford</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lydcot,</hi> both preſent at the ſaid Tryal,) <hi>That he the
ſaid</hi> Dugdale, <hi>having received a Letter on the</hi> 14th. <hi>of</hi> October, <hi>which
mentioned the death of a Juſtice of Peace, did the ſame day at an</hi> Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
<hi>in</hi> Tixal, <hi>impart the Contents of the ſaid Letter to Mr.</hi> Sambidge,
<hi>Kinſman to my Lord</hi> Aſton, And Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Tixal;</hi> And
that they anſwered, <hi>They heard nothing of it before.</hi> Now to confute this,
my Lord produced for Witneſſes the ſame Mr. <hi>Sambidge</hi> and Mr. <hi>Philips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Sambidge</hi> proteſted upon his Salvation, <hi>Dugdale never told him
any ſuch thing; Nor did he ever hear of it, till the</hi> Friday <hi>or</hi> Saturday
<hi>Sir</hi> Edmundbury Godfrey <hi>was found at</hi> Bury-Hill.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> atteſted, <hi>That he never heard of it, either by Letter or
Word of Mouth, from</hi> Dugdale <hi>or any other, till the death of Sir</hi> Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Godfrey <hi>was publickly known.</hi> To ballance this <hi>Evidence,</hi> the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers</hi>
produced theſe Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Anſel</hi> depoſed, <hi>That at the</hi> Ale-houſe, <hi>and day above named, he

<hi>and Mr.</hi> Philips <hi>being then both in the Houſe, but not in the ſame
Room with</hi> Anſel, <hi>when</hi> Dugdale <hi>told the News.</hi>

heard <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſay, <hi>There was a Juſtice of Peace Murdered, that lived
at</hi> Weſtminſter; And that when <hi>Dugdale</hi> told this News, Mr. <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> were by, and might have heard it, if they
would.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Birch</hi> and Mr. <hi>Turton</hi> both atteſted, <hi>That about the fifteenth or
ſixteenth of the ſame</hi> October, <hi>the news of Sir</hi> Edmundbury Godfreys
<hi>Death, was ſpread about the Countrey, and ſeemed to take its first riſe
from</hi> Tixal.</p>
                  <p>UPon theſe ſeveral <hi>Evidences,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page. 177.</note> the <hi>Mannagers</hi> made theſe <hi>Obſervations. Firſt,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Sambidge</hi> was ſomething deaf, and might not here when <hi>Dugdale</hi> told
him the news of the Death of a Juſtice of Peace. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Phillips</hi> the
<hi>Parſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> being perhaps very Studious in his Employment, might be wanting in
point of Memory.<note place="margin">Page 175.</note> 
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The other Witneſſes produced in Confirmation of
<hi>Dugdel's Evidence,</hi> make it our, that he did impart the news at the time, place,
and in the preſence of the parties above-mentioned.</p>
                  <p>To which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> anſwer. <hi>To the firſt,</hi> If what the <hi>Mannagers</hi> alledge be
true, then is <hi>Dugdale</hi> here alſo proved <hi>Perjured</hi> by the <hi>Mannagers</hi> themſelves;
For he expreſly Swore at the ſaid Tryal of Sir <hi>George Wakeman, That</hi> Mr. Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge
<hi>both heard and anſwered him.</hi> Saying, <hi>He heard nothing of the news before.
To the ſecond,</hi> No honeſt man affirms or denies any paſt words or actions, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he remembers; and to pretend want of Memory in a direct <hi>Evidence,</hi>
is the common Road, whereby to evade all humane <hi>Testimony. To the third,</hi>
The other Witneſſes on behalf of <hi>Dugdale,</hi> do in no ſort make out the thing for
which they are produced; For <hi>Anſel</hi> doth not own, that <hi>Philips</hi> and <hi>Sambidge</hi>
were ſo much as in the ſame Room with <hi>Dugdale,</hi> when he mentioned the
death of a Juſtice of Peace. <hi>Hanſon</hi> indeed (herein contradicting <hi>Anſel</hi>) tells us
they were in the Room, but could not ſay they heard, much leſs anſwered, to
the diſcourſe of <hi>Dugdale;</hi> which is the chief matter of <hi>Perjury</hi> here charged
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48868:14"/>
upon him. As for what Mr. <hi>Birch</hi> and <hi>Turton</hi> declared, concerning the Rumour
ſoon after ſpread of the death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> it nothing at all Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
the preſent proof of <hi>Periury,</hi> ſeeing it may well be true, there was ſuch a
report, and yet falſe, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> had ſuch a diſcourſe with <hi>Sambidge</hi> and
<hi>Philips,</hi> as he poſitively Swears, and they both as poſitively deny. But enough
hath been already ſaid upon this Subject, where we treated of the Death of Sir
<hi>Edmundbury Godfrey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FIfthly, <hi>Dugdale</hi> in an <hi>Information</hi> given upon <hi>Oath,</hi> Swore; <hi>That
preſently after one</hi> Howard, <hi>Almoner to the Queen went beyond the
Seas, he was told by</hi> George Hobſon, <hi>then Servant to the Lord</hi> Aſton,
<hi>That there was a Deſign intended for the Reformation of the Government
to the</hi> Popiſh Religion. Now it was owned and acknowledged in
Court, point blank contrary to this <hi>Information: That the ſaid</hi> Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<hi>was not Servant to the Lord</hi> Aſton, <hi>nor known by</hi> Dugdale, <hi>three
years after the departure of the ſaid</hi> Almoner <hi>out of</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>UPon this proof of <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s <hi>Perjury</hi> the <hi>Mannagers</hi> made this obſervation,<note place="margin">Page 178.</note>
(<hi>viz) That</hi> Dugdale's <hi>words cited in the</hi> Information, <hi>are capable of two
ſenſes, either they may import,</hi> Hobſon <hi>told him there was a Deſign ever ſince the</hi>
Almoner <hi>went away;</hi> Or they may import, Hobſon <hi>told him preſently after
the</hi> Almoner <hi>went away, there was a Deſign;</hi> The firſt ſenſe may refer to the
matter told: The ſecond to the time when told: The words taken in the firſt
ſenſe, argue no contradiction in <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s <hi>Teſtimony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> anſwer: The words of the <hi>Information</hi> taken in their
plain, obvious and connatural ſenſe, clearly import; Hobſon <hi>related to</hi> Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,
<hi>there was a Deſign, which relation</hi> Hobſon <hi>made to</hi> Dugdale <hi>preſently after
the time one</hi> Howard <hi>went beyond the Seas;</hi> Nor can any other conſtruction be
put upon the words, without manifeſtly wreſting them from their <hi>Genuine ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,</hi>
as every impartial Reader may ſee; So that the proof here given of
<hi>Dugdales Perjury</hi> is unanſwerable.</p>

                  <p>To take off the Credit of the two firſt Witneſſes in this matter, (<hi>viz.)
Holt</hi> and <hi>Robinſon</hi> (nothing material being objected againſt <hi>Morral</hi> or

<hi>&amp;c. That he owned himſelf, upon Examination, to be a Rogue; And

                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe unqueſtionable <hi>Evidences</hi> againſt <hi>Robinſon,</hi> my Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
<hi>He knew nothing of</hi> Robinſon <hi>before;</hi> and added, It was very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
<hi>That</hi> Dugdale <hi>knowing, it ſeems his Friend and Comrade</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon
<hi>to be a</hi> Cheat, <hi>and then in want, thought him a tool fittest for
his purpoſe,</hi>
the moſt eaſily prevailed upon, <hi>and moſt proper to make
a Knight of the Poſt.</hi> So that the two laſt worthy Witneſſes, did by
their <hi>Evidence,</hi> rather confirm then leſſen the belief of <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
with <hi>Robinſon</hi> herein.</p>
                  <p>UPon theſe ſeveral <hi>Evidences,</hi> the <hi>Mannagers</hi> made theſe Obſervations: Firſt,
<hi>It was not likely, that</hi> Dugdale <hi>a ſtranger to</hi> Robinſon, <hi>ſhould attempt to
Suborn him to Swear againſt a Perſon he knew not, and in a matter whereof he
was wholly Ignorant.</hi> Secondly, <hi>It doth not appear, that</hi> Dugdale <hi>had any ill will
to</hi> Moore, <hi>that ſhould induce him to Suborn</hi> Holt <hi>to Swear against him.</hi> Thirdly,
<hi>Both</hi> Robinſon <hi>and</hi> Holt <hi>were Infamous Men; the one being a</hi> Common Cheat, <hi>the
other a</hi> Drunken Quarrelſom Fellow, <hi>and ſeeming to favour the</hi> Plotters. Fourthly,
Morral <hi>was but a Poor</hi> Barber, <hi>of no Reputation, and one who might eaſily be
brought to ſay what he did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which the</hi> Papiſts <hi>anſwer: To the firſt, Robinſon</hi> was no Stranger to <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale;</hi>
He was (as the Earl of <hi>Macklesfeild</hi> and Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> atteſted) every where
about <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> remarkably known for Cheating at <hi>Dice, Cock-ſightings,
Races,</hi> &amp;c. (exerciſes alſo frequent with <hi>Dugdale</hi> himſelf;) Nor is it material
that <hi>Robinſon knew not my Lord</hi> Stafford, <hi>nor any thing of him:</hi> It was not <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
buſineſs to find out a Man, who to diſcharge a good Conſcience would
Swear <hi>what he knew;</hi> But who to get Money would Swear <hi>what he knew not;</hi>
For which purpoſe <hi>Dugdale</hi> had good reaſon to think <hi>Robinſon</hi> a very proper
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48868:15"/>
                     <hi>Inſtrument. To the ſecond,</hi> It is plain matter of Fact, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> having
accuſed and Impriſoned <hi>Moore</hi> for carrying away <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ers,</hi> but not able to prove
it, he would have hired <hi>Holt</hi> to make out his <hi>falſe</hi> accuſation. <hi>To the third,</hi>
If <hi>Robinſon</hi> and <hi>Holt</hi> were <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Rogues,</hi> my Lord well inferred, they were the
more likely to be choſen by <hi>Dugdale</hi> for ſuch Imployments as he had for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Though for <hi>Holt,</hi> the greateſt offence laid to his Charge ſeems to be, that he
Quarrelled with <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Witneſſes, as thinking <hi>no honeſt Man would take his
part. To the fourth,</hi> Though <hi>Morral</hi> was <hi>Poor,</hi> yet it doth not appear but that
he was ſo <hi>honeſt,</hi> as not to be <hi>Suborned</hi> to <hi>Perjury</hi> by <hi>Dugdale;</hi> And therefore
his clear and poſitive Evidence in this matter ought to ſtand good. But let it be
granted, what the <hi>Mannagers</hi> conteſt for, (<hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) That becauſe</hi> Morral <hi>was Poor,</hi>
Holt <hi>Quarrelſome, and</hi> Robinſon <hi>Infamous; none of theſe three Witneſſes ought to
be believed;</hi> What then will become of all the <hi>Kings Witneſſes?</hi> (as they term
them,) What ſhall we believe or ſay of them? Are they Perſons of Repute, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and Honour? Are they not rather the Scum and Refuſe of the Nation?
Why muſt credit be denyed to <hi>Beggers or Knaves,</hi> when they accuſe their <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals</hi>
in probable matters? without hopes of Gain? And yet the ſame credit be
allowed to the like <hi>Beggars</hi> and <hi>Knaves,</hi> when they Swear againſt <hi>Perſons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
Moral impoſſibilities and contradictions upon large hopes and promiſes of
reward? This the <hi>Papiſts</hi> take to be hard meaſure.</p>
                  <p>TO Counterpoiſe in ſome ſort this charge of <hi>Subornation</hi> laid to
<hi>Dugdale.</hi> The <hi>Mannagers</hi> alledged the like proceedings on

                     <hi>Thomas Launder</hi> depoſed, <hi>That my Lord</hi> Aſtons <hi>Friends had Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
him up to my Lord</hi> Aſtons <hi>Tryal, to give Evidence againſt</hi> Anſel
<hi>and</hi> Dugdale; <hi>and that he was to have an Horſe to ride on, and Money
in his Pocket.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Simon Wright,</hi> Barber to <hi>Dugdale,</hi> depoſed, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Pleſſington <hi>told

he ſhould have ſeven hundred pounds.</hi> And that the ſaid <hi>Pleſſington</hi>
and others, would have had him Swear point blank, <hi>That</hi> Dugdale
<hi>would have hired him to give Evidence againſt Mrs.</hi> Price, <hi>and Mr.</hi>
Tasborough.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Lord</hi> at once to confound this man, by his own <hi>Testimony,</hi> and
further to detect the Subornation of <hi>Dugdale</hi> alſo in this matter; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

                  </p>
                  <p>UPon this diverſity of Evidence, the Mannagers made this Obſervation, (<hi>viz.)
That the Attempts made to Silborn</hi> Launder <hi>and</hi> Wright, <hi>were manifeſt Signs

                     <hi>To which the Papiſts anſwer.</hi> It is not conceivable how the Evidence given by
<hi>Launder</hi> and <hi>Wright</hi> can draw the leaſt ſuſpiſion of Subornation on my Lord or
his Friends: For the Propoſal made to <hi>Launder</hi> was by my Lord <hi>Aston</hi>'s Friends,
and in behalf of my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> and not of my Lord <hi>Stafford.</hi> Beſides the
words underſtood with that Candor and Sincerity they ſeem to have been
ſpoken by my Lord <hi>Aston</hi>'s Friends, import no more then this. That if <hi>Launder</hi>

of that <hi>Matchleſs</hi> worth, and hath given ſo clear proofs, both of his own

                  <p>THe laſt great Exception made by my Lord againſt <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

Entruſted him with all their Letters, that there came to his Hands whole
Packets to and from ſeveral perſons, in ſeveral places, all containing
moſt Damnable Treaſon; many of which, he ſaid, he opened, read
and knew the Contents: Yet though the preſerving two or three;
nay, even one ſingle Letter, under the Authors hand, might have been
ſo highly advantageous to the proving the Truth, both of his own Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and the whole Plot in general: Nevertheleſs he could not
produce one Scrip or Line to back his Aſſertion, or clear himſelf from
the Forgeries laid to his charge.</p>
                  <p>To obviate this Exception; the <hi>Mannagers</hi> brought in two Siſters,
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Anne Elder:</hi> Theſe Siſters Depoſed; That <hi>Dugdale</hi>
coming one day to their Houſe with ſeveral Bundles of Papers in his

                     <hi>To the anſwer therefore given by Doctor</hi> Oates; <hi>the Papiſts reply, Poverty</hi> is an

                  <p>THe ſecond <hi>Exception</hi> made by my Lord againſt <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence,<note place="margin">Page 101.</note>
was; That the ſaid <hi>Oates</hi> had <hi>Perjured</hi> himſelf in two <hi>Depoſitions,
directly contradictory to each other:</hi> For proof of this, my Lord appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to divers of the <hi>Lords</hi> themſelves, who were preſent at both the
ſaid <hi>Depoſitons;</hi> amongſt whom the Earl of <hi>Berckley</hi> being required
to ſpeak what he knew: Atteſted, <q>That my <hi>Lord Chancellour</hi> did ask
Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> at the Bar of the Houſe this Queſtion, (<hi>viz.</hi>) My Lords
deſire to know if you can accuſe any other <hi>perſon or perſons of what
quality ſoever?</hi> And you are encouraged by their Lordſhips to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
them.</q> 
                     <hi>Oates</hi> his anſwer was, my Lords, <hi>I have no more to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
in Relation to</hi> England: Notwithſtanding which Depoſition, he
afterwards in another (with unſpeakable Inſolence) expreſly Accuſed
the <hi>Queen</hi> in a matter (as he thought) of no leſs then <hi>High Treaſon,</hi>
From hence my Lord concluded, if the <hi>firſt Depoſition</hi> was true, <hi>Oates</hi>
was Perjured in the <hi>Latter:</hi> If the <hi>Latter</hi> was true, he was Perjur'd in
the <hi>Firſt;</hi> ſo that which of the two ſoever is True or Falſe, he is

                  </p>
                  <p>UPon this Proof,<note place="margin">Page 179.</note> the <hi>Managers</hi> made theſe Obſervations. <hi>Firſt Doctor</hi> Oates
<hi>having ſaid much, and having many things in his Head, could peradventure
not remember on a ſudden this particular of the</hi> Queen. <hi>Secondly, The Evidence
which Doctor</hi> Oates <hi>gave afterwards of the</hi> Queen <hi>was not poſitive, nor of his own
knowledge, but words which he heard ſpoken in a</hi> Room <hi>in which he was not himſelf;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48868:17"/>
but coming in afterwards, he ſaw the</hi> Queen <hi>there. Thirdly, It might not be ſo clear
to Doctor</hi> Oates <hi>whether the</hi> Queen <hi>was a Perſon capable of an Accuſation, ſo as to
be tryed for Treaſon.</hi>

Senſe;
that a man whoſe Buſineſs and Study it was to <hi>Diſcover a Plot
againſt the Life of the King,</hi> and who by ſeveral long premeditated Depoſitions,
had (as he ſaid) diſcharged himſelf of all he knew  ſhould notwithſtanding
all this while never remember the moſt Eſſential part. (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Inhumane
<hi>Murder of the King, Deſigned and Conſented to by his own Royal Conſort.</hi> To the
ſecond, <hi>Oates</hi> Depoſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

them with ſuch particulars of Time and Place, as plainly denote he intended a
full and home Accuſation againſt the <hi>Queen.</hi> And granted, his Evidence was
not poſitive, yet the matter was of ſuch dangerous conſequence, as ought not to
to be concealed, eſpecially, at a time when he was upon his Oath, to ſpeak all
he knew, and when he pretended by Diſcoveries to Save the <hi>Life of the King.</hi>
To the Third, Though <hi>Oates</hi> left to himſelf <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> be very Stupid, yet he could not be
ſo ignorant as not to know, that a <hi>Queen</hi> deſigning to <hi>Murder the King her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
is guilty of <hi>Treaſon;</hi> and whether She was lyable to a <hi>Tryal</hi> or no. <hi>Oates</hi>
was guilty of <hi>Perjury;</hi> In that being Commanded and Encouraged by the Lords
to make an entire Diſcovery of all he knew againſt any <hi>Perſon</hi> of what Degree
or <hi>Quality ſoever;</hi> he expreſly Swore, <hi>He had no more to Accuſe in</hi> England. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Tranſcendent Luſtre of the <hi>Queens Virtue, Innocence and Endeared
Affection to His Majeſty,</hi> leaves no <hi>place for Calumny to ſix upon:</hi> And the bare
<hi>Charge</hi> of ſo ſoul a <hi>Crime,</hi> upon ſo Renowned a <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> is of it ſelf Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of other Contradictions, a more then ſufficient <hi>Conviction of</hi> Oates's <hi>Perjury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THe third Exception made by my <hi>Lord</hi> againſt <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence
was;<note place="margin">Oates's <hi>new Porgeries.</hi> Page 102.</note> That though <hi>Oates</hi> in his ſeveral <hi>Depoſitions</hi> (particularly
thoſe taken before the <hi>Privy Councel,</hi> and <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi>) did often
affirm he had given an entire and Faithful account, to the beſt of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
<hi>Of all whatſoever he knew, as to the matters and perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Plot:</hi> And though he had then alſo time and opportunity
to reflect and deliberate upon what might any wiſe relate to my Lord
<hi>Stafford</hi> in that affair; yet he never accuſed him of any other thing,
then only, <hi>That he had ſeen beyond the Seas ſome Letters Signed</hi> Stafford,
wherein the Writer had teſtifyed his zeal for the Catholick Deſign:
But when afterwards conſulting with himſelf, and poſſibly with ſome
others, he found this flamm of his would not amount to any thing
material whereon to ground an Impeachment, he Invented and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon my <hi>Lord</hi> a <hi>Commiſſion of Pay-Maſter-General to the Army;</hi>
a device he never once thought on before. From which proceeding
my <hi>Lord</hi> argued; If there were ſuch a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> received by my
Lord at <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber, in ſuch a manner as <hi>Oates</hi> relates; this
<hi>Commiſſion</hi> being a matter of ſo grand Importance, and the Delivery
of it accompanied with ſo many remarkable circumſtances in the very
preſence of <hi>Oates.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 25.</note> It is impoſſible that the ſaid <hi>Oates,</hi> who (as he ſaith)
on purpoſe for Diſcovery, had taken Notes and Memorials, even of
Trivial Occurrences, ſhould forget, and by conſequence omit a thing
of this high concern in his former <hi>Depoſitions.</hi> But if there were no
ſuch <hi>Commiſſion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 126.</note> (as Moſt aſſuredly there was none) then is <hi>Oates</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
in his preſent Evidence: And verily (added my Lord) if it be
permitted to this man dayly to frame <hi>New Accuſations;</hi> If eaſie credit
be given to all his Fables, and whatſoever he ſhall from time to time
<hi>Invent,</hi> may paſs for <hi>good Evidence;</hi> Who can be ſecure? At this rate,
he may by deegrees Impeach the whole Nation, for Crimes which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>UPon this preſſing Inference the <hi>Mannagers</hi> made this following Obſervation:
<hi>Suppoſe Dr.</hi> Oates <hi>did out of</hi> Levity, <hi>or for want of being well grounded in his
own, turn to</hi> another Religion. It is hard, <hi>That the matter of changing his</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<hi>when nothing elſe is laid to his charge, ſhould diſparage his Teſtimony, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many who have changed their</hi> Religion <hi>more then once (Example</hi> Mr. Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth)
<hi>are yet eſteemed</hi> credible Perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which the</hi> Papiſts <hi>anſwer:</hi> To change from a <hi>wrong</hi> to a <hi>right Religion,</hi> is
no diſparagement; but <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will hardly allow <hi>Oate</hi>'s firſt pretended change
to be ſuch. However my <hi>Lord</hi> inſiſted not upon the <hi>changing</hi> but the <hi>ſeigning
Religion. Oates</hi> did not out of <hi>Levity</hi> or <hi>Conviction</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi>)
turn from his <hi>own</hi> to <hi>another Religion.</hi> but remaining <hi>interiourly</hi> of the
ſame belief, he <hi>exteriouſly</hi> renounced what he ſo believed, and <hi>Sacrilegiouſly</hi>
practiſed the direct contrary, than which nothing can be more deteſtable. Nay
he affirmeth, <hi>he often received the</hi> Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>and took dreadful</hi> Oaths of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy

credit can be given to a <hi>Monſter</hi> accuſtomed and inſured (by his own cofeſſion)

                  <p>To Confront theſe Teſtimonies,<note place="margin">Pag. 152.</note> the <hi>Mannagers</hi> produced one Mr.
<hi>Powel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> who depoſed, That <hi>Turbervil</hi> told them, <hi>He
had much to ſay in relation to the</hi> Plot, but did not name any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
fearing (he ſaid) he might be diſcouraged in it.</p>

UPon theſe Teſtimonies of Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Yalden,</hi> The <hi>Mannagers</hi> made
theſe Obſervations. Firſt, <hi>It is not probable, that</hi> Turbervil <hi>deſigning to be a</hi>
Diſcoverer, <hi>ſhould diſable himſelf ever to be ſo, by Swearing Horrid Oaths, he
knew nothing of the</hi> Plot. Secondly, <hi>The Teſtimony of</hi> Porter <hi>and</hi> Yalden <hi>are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the contrary Teſtimony of</hi> Powel <hi>and</hi> Arnold,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which the</hi> Papiſts <hi>anſwer: To the firſt,</hi> It is not improbable, but very
likely, that <hi>Turbervil</hi> as yet not fully reſolved, to make Shipwrack of his
Conſcience and Honeſty, did often proteſt, <hi>He knew nothing of the Plot;</hi> And
if the poſitive atteſtation of two credible Witneſſes may be admitted for
good Evidence: It is not bare probability, but juſt and ſolid proof that he
did ſo; And by conſequence, his preſent Diſcoveries ought not to be regarded,
otherwiſe then as the new and gainful Inventions of a <hi>Perjured</hi> Man. <hi>To the
ſecond,</hi> The Teſtimony of <hi>Powel,</hi> and <hi>Arnold</hi> hath no manner of weight againſt
my <hi>Lord's</hi> Evidence, but rather compleats the charge of <hi>Perjury</hi> againſt <hi>Turbervil.</hi>
For it is granted, that <hi>Turbervil</hi> hath ſaid and Swore, both to <hi>Powel, Arnold,</hi>
and the whole <hi>Houſe of Parliament, He knew much of the Plot.</hi> But this being
directly contradictory to the dreadful Oaths here atteſted by <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Yalden,</hi>
and no wiſe denyed by <hi>Powel</hi> and <hi>Arnold;</hi> It followeth by the Teſtimony of all
the four Witneſſes, that <hi>Turbervil</hi> is guilty of <hi>Perjury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SEcondly, <hi>Turbervil</hi> Swears: <hi>That during the Fortnights acquaintance
with my Lord at</hi> Paris,<note place="margin">Page 109.</note> 
                     <hi>he had, by means of the</hi> Prieſts, <hi>frequent acceſs
to him, at his Lodgings there.</hi> Now my Lord's Gentleman and Page,
who both then conſtantly waited on him, atteſted, <hi>They never once ſaw</hi>
Turbervil <hi>there;</hi> And <hi>Turbervil</hi> himſelf acknowledged in Court, <hi>He
knew them not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To qualify this <hi>Evidence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 151.</note> 
                     <hi>Thomas Mort</hi> was called, who depoſed;
<q>
                        <hi>That he being at</hi> Paris <hi>and deſirous to return into</hi> England; Turbervil
<hi>told him, his Brother the</hi> Monk, <hi>had introduced him into the ſavour of a</hi>
Lord, <hi>by which means they might both of them have the convenience of
paſſage in a</hi> Yacht, <hi>which ſtaid for my Lord at</hi> Diep. <hi>That hereupon they
went to</hi> Diep, <hi>but finding no</hi> Yacht <hi>there,</hi> Turbervil <hi>told him, If they
went to</hi> Calis, <hi>they might go over with my Lord from thence in the</hi> Yacht.</q>
At laſt they light on a Fiſher-Boat at <hi>Diep,</hi> and ſo came over in it; But
that this forementioned <hi>Lord</hi> was my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> or that he ever ſaw
<hi>Turbervil</hi> in my Lord's Lodgings, or Company at <hi>Paris,</hi> or elſe-where,
he could not ſay.</p>
                  <p>UPon theſe Teſtimonies, the Mannagers made this Obſervation: (<hi>v<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>z) The</hi>
Prieſts <hi>had ſuch a tranſcendent Inſluence over my</hi> Lord, <hi>as might gain admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for any whom they pleaſed, not only into my</hi> Lord's Houſe, <hi>but alſo into my</hi>
Lord's Heart, <hi>without the privity or knowledge of his Servants. Now it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the atteſtation of</hi> Mort, <hi>that</hi> Turbervil, <hi>through his Brother the</hi> Monk's
<hi>means, was become my</hi> Lord's Favourite.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which the</hi> Papiſts <hi>anſwer:</hi> It is not proved, either that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had ſuch
a Tranſcendent Influence over my Lord's <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> or that <hi>Turbervil</hi>
through their means, became a Favourite? <hi>Mort</hi> indeed tells us, <hi>Turbervil</hi> told
him, <hi>His Brother the</hi> Monk <hi>had Introduced him into the Favour of a</hi> Lord; <hi>And
this Favour only, to come over with him in a</hi> Yacht. For the Truth of which alſo
he had only <hi>Turbervil</hi>'s word, and the thing it ſelf never performed. Muſt we
from hence infer, <hi>my Lord had given his Heart to the Prieſts,</hi> and they had Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<hi>Turbervil</hi> into it? A ſtrange Inference: But let it be granted, my Lord
had a real Friendſhip and Kindneſs for the <hi>Monks,</hi> what then? How is it proved,
they imployed their Intereſt with him, in Trayterous <hi>Deſigns?</hi> Why? <hi>Turbervil</hi>
Swears it. Thus one <hi>Forgery</hi> is made uſe of to ſupport another, and nothing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48868:19"/>
but proofleſs Fictions to make all out: Yet to come more cloſe to the preſent
Evidence. Had the <hi>Prieſts</hi> Introduced <hi>Turbervil</hi> into my Lords acquaintance and
favour; this could not be done Inviſibly to the Servants; ſome body muſt needs
ſee and know, when they came in and out; My Lord was then in Lodgings,
and had none but two Servants about him; <hi>Turbervil</hi> never pretends either the
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> or he, made a ſecret of their viſits; Their acceſſes to my Lord (he ſaith)
were very frequent, as the nature of the buſineſs, and pretended intimacy with
my Lord, ſeem'd to require. The Condition of <hi>Turbervil</hi> was alſo ſuch, as might
well render him deſirous of the Servants acquaintance and Friendſhip; eſpecially
being then (as he ſaid) immeditrly to go over in the <hi>Yacht</hi> with them, and to
continue employed in my Lords <hi>Deſigns</hi> and Service at <hi>London.</hi> Now that a
Man in theſe Circumſtaces, ſhould not know theſe Servants, nor be known, or
ſo much as once ſeen by them; is Morally Impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>THirdly <hi>Turbervil</hi> Swears, That when he took leave of my Lord at
<hi>Paris,</hi> to come for <hi>England,</hi> his Lordſhip was troubled with
the <hi>Gout</hi> in his Foot. Now my Lord proteſted in the preſence of all
that knew him, he never had the <hi>Gout</hi> in all his Life; His Servants alſo
who then lived with him,<note place="margin">Page 108.</note> (<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Furneſs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>) gave at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,
they never knew him ſubject to that Infirmity; only ſeveral
years ſince, he had been troubled with the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> which my Lord
confeſſed, and the <hi>Earl of Stamſord</hi> teſtiſied; made him ſometimes
formerly (though never at <hi>Paris</hi>) walk with a Staff.</p>
                  <p>UPon theſe Teſtimonies, the <hi>Mannagers</hi> made no Obſervations. But the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> Avouch, here is alſo direct <hi>Perjury</hi> proved upon <hi>Turbervil,</hi> by two
Credible Witneſſes. And though the ſubject of the <hi>Perjury</hi> ſeems not to be
matterial to the main Accuſation, yet he that ſhall wilfully <hi>Perjure</hi> himſelf in
any one Circumſtance, ought not to be credited in the whole; Seeing Nature
it ſelf, abhors the Teſtimony of a Man, who hath once <hi>Invoked Almighty God
to bear Witneſs to a Lye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOurthly <hi>Turbervil</hi> Swears, <hi>That after his refuſing to be a</hi> Fryer, <hi>he was
diſcountenanced by the Lord</hi> Powis, <hi>and others of his Friends and
Relations, ſo that he durſt not appear amongſt them.</hi> Now my Lord
proved, by ſeveral Witneſſes. That after his return from the ſaid
<hi>Fryers,</hi> he was civilly treated, and charitably entertained, by his ſaid
Friends and Relations. <hi>To make this good,</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>John Turbervil,</hi> Brother to the Deponent, atteſted, <hi>He never knew
that any of his Relations gave him an Angry word; but on the contrary,
when he went to</hi> Paris, <hi>his Siſter beſtowed on him Seven Pounds to bear
his Charges;</hi> Upon which he ſaid, <hi>He would never trouble them more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>UPon theſe Teſtimonies,<note place="margin">Page 181.</note> the <hi>Mannagers</hi> made theſe Obſervations, <hi>Firſt, Though</hi>
Turbervil <hi>might peradventure (as</hi> Minehead <hi>atteſts) be civily Treated by my
Lord</hi> Powis <hi>in publick, yet what Reproaches or unkind words might paſs between my
Lord and him in private,</hi> Minehead <hi>might not hear.</hi> Secondly, <hi>It was no great
Kindneſs in</hi> Turbervil<hi>'s Relations, to give him Seven Pounds (as his Brother atteſts)
never to ſee him more; They rather purchaſed his abſence, then did him a Kindneſs
by ſuch a Favour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> anſwer: <hi>To the firſt,</hi> Groundleſs Surmiſes of private un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſes,

ſo much as pretends, Is a ſtrange way of clearing a Man in open Court
from the guilt of <hi>Perjury;</hi> To frame and fancy things that poſſibly might be,
and draw prejudicial Inferences from thence, as if they actually had been, is
unjuſt proceeding. <hi>To the ſecond, Turbervil</hi> (as his Brother atteſts) never had
one angry word from his Relations; and when his Siſter gave him Seven
pounds, it was not to purchaſe his abſence, nor did they turn him away. But
he himſelf, aſhamed it ſeems of his paſt miſdemeanours, and confounded at the
goodneſs of his Friends. Said, <hi>He would never trouble them more.</hi>

are to be underſtood, That he was informed, my</hi> Lord <hi>came over by the way of</hi> Calais
<hi>in the Company of Count</hi> Gramoun: <hi>Now that Mr.</hi> Turbervil <hi>was thus informed, is
evident, as well by the Letter which (he ſaith) he received at</hi> Deep <hi>from my Lord,
as alſo by the aſorementioned Atteſtation of</hi> Mort <hi>who ſayeth, That being at</hi> Deep,
Turbervil <hi>told him, if they went to</hi> Calais, they might go over with my Lord in the

                     <hi>To which the</hi> Papiſts <hi>anſwer:</hi> To excuſe a man from Pejury, by pretending an
occuls meaning and intention in the Swearer, not expreſſed in the words of
his Oath, is ſuch an Evaſion, as if admitted, would deſtroy the Integrity of
an Oath, and elude all proof of Perjury whatſoever: <hi>Turbervil</hi> Swears in down,
right terms, my <hi>Lord</hi> came over by the way of <hi>Calais</hi> in the Company of
Count <hi>Gramount,</hi> without any addition <hi>That he was Informed ſo.</hi> In which Oath
he is directly Perjured; for he Swears as an abſolute Truth, and without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction,
what of it ſelf is an abſolute Lye, and what at beſt he could but
Gueſs at, by report and hera-ſay. It is true indeed, he contradicts himſelf in
the ſequel of his Information, by ſaying <hi>He came away before my Lord, and had
not his Paſſage with him;</hi> but it is connatural to <hi>Perjury,</hi> to include contradictions;
Wicked Men are often blinded with Malice, Paſſion, or Intereſt; And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to find Incoherence of parts, in a Story diveſted of Truth. The only thing
can be collected of Probability in this whole matter is, That <hi>Turbervil</hi> being at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
in an Indigent condition, and deſirous to return home, got imperfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lord (whoſe name as yet he knew not) and a <hi>French
Count</hi> called <hi>Gramount,</hi> had a Yacht waited for them at <hi>Diep.</hi> And having alſo
a Brother then in <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſought by his means to gain admittance for a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
in the ſaid Yacht. This deſign of his he imparts to <hi>Mort,</hi> a Perſon in the
ſame condition, and who had the ſame purpoſe with himſelf. Hereupon <hi>Mort</hi>
and he go to <hi>Diep</hi> in hopes to find the Yacht there, but they fail'd of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
and <hi>Turbervil</hi> miſſing the Yacht, would have perſwaded <hi>Mort</hi> to go
in the ſearch of it to <hi>Calais;</hi> Whilſt they were in this debate, they lighted on a
Fiſher-Boat, and ſo came over in it into <hi>England.</hi> Thus much may be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the Relation of <hi>Mort.</hi> But that <hi>Turbervil</hi> during his ſtay at <hi>Diep,</hi> recci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Letter from my Lord, intimating his intention of coming for <hi>England,</hi> by
the way of <hi>Calais,</hi> and that he ſhould haſten to meet him at <hi>London,</hi> is a moſt
palpable Forgery; For neither could <hi>Turbervil,</hi> when required, produce any
ſuch Letter, nor did my Lord come over by the way of <hi>Calais</hi> as <hi>Turbervil</hi> would
have us believe that Letter Imported. And indeed who can imagine, my Lord

                  <p>SEventhly, <hi>Turbervil</hi> in the laſt mentioned Information poſitively
Swore:<note place="margin">Page 101.</note> That the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> was preſent at certain Fraite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

(73) Now my Lord proved, that the ſaid Earl of <hi>Caſilemain</hi> was never
at <hi>Powis-Caſtle</hi> within the compaſs of that whole time.</p>
                  <p>This was demonſtrated by the Atteſtation of Mr. <hi>Lidcot</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi>
and Fellow of <hi>Kings-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who having Lived with
the Earl Nine years, and particularly Accompanied him in all his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys

this diſtinct account out of his Book of Journals (<hi>viz.</hi>) <q>My Lord

                  <p>UPon this proof of Perjury the <hi>Mannagers</hi> made this Obſervation: <hi>Mr.</hi>
Lydcot <hi>the Fellow of</hi> Kings-Colledge (as he call'd himſelf) <hi>was indeed ſo
out in his Arithmatick, ſo miſtaken in the year; And uſed the</hi> Roman <hi>stile</hi> (or

                  </p>
                  <p>To which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> anſwer: That a ſolid Witneſs ought not be Railed
out of his Evidence, in a matter of Life and Death, Mr. <hi>Lydcot</hi> (however
skilled in Arithmatick, however great or little <hi>Protestant</hi>) ſubſtantially proved
the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> never was at, or near <hi>Powis-Caſtle,</hi> from the firſt of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>

<hi>He was at a Conſult there.</hi> And it is ſtrange, ſo weighty and convincing a proof

Beggery, Looſe manner of Life, and divers odd Circumſtances
in the courſe of his Evidence, which much reflected upon his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

                     <note place="margin">Page 154.</note> 
                     <hi>Jones, Hobby</hi> and <hi>Scudamore,</hi> Depoſed; That they knew
<hi>Turbervil,</hi> but <hi>for their parts never heard, or ſaw any evil by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi> a Miniſter Depoſed the ſame, as to <hi>Turbervil</hi>'s Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and added: That <hi>Turbervil</hi> a little before he made his Diſcovery,
owned himſelf a <hi>Roman-Catholick;</hi> but ſeemed to have a mind to quit
that Religion, being convinced by the Arguments <hi>Matthews</hi> gave him,
of the Excellency of the Principles and Practices of the <hi>Proteſtant
Church;</hi> yet would never acknowledge he knew one Syllable of the
Plot.</p>
                  <p>UPon theſe ſeveral <hi>Remarques,</hi> the <hi>Mannagers</hi> made this Obſervation:
<hi>The good Character here given of</hi> Turbervil, <hi>by four Witneſſes, ſhew him a Man
of much Vertue and Integrity; And it ought to be conſidered as a farther addition to
his Praiſe, that he had the grace</hi> (though indigent) <hi>to refuſe the propoſal made
to him by my Lord, of</hi> Killing the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which the</hi> Papiſts <hi>anſwer:</hi> It is no ſufficient proof of <hi>Turbervil</hi>'s Vertue and
Integrity, that four Perſons ſay, <hi>They know no ill of him;</hi> He may be guilty ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
of a Thouſand Crimes unknown to them; few or none are ſo intirely
abandoned or deteſted by all Mankind, as not to find four Perſons in the World
who will make a favourable report of them. But it is evident from what hath
been already proved; That <hi>Turbervil</hi> was a man in all points compleatly equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for a <hi>Knight of the Poſt:</hi> For firſt, he was indigent; Secondly, he was hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly
addicted to <hi>Curſing</hi> and <hi>Swearing;</hi> Thirdly, he looked upon feigning Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
as the only way to get Moneys. All this is manifeſted by his own
Words and converſation with Mr. <hi>Yalden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> before mentioned;
<hi>As I hope for Salvation</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I know nothing of the Plot. The Devil take the
Duke of</hi> York, Monmouth, <hi>and all. God damn me, there is now no Trade good but
that of a Diſcoverer.</hi> Who ſhall ever want Witneſſes, that can find men thus
qualified? And whereas it is ſaid, he had the grace to refuſe the propoſal made
to him, of <hi>Killing the King.</hi> It ought firſt to be proved, otherwiſe then by his
own aſſertion; He had ſuch a <hi>Propoſal</hi> made, before the <hi>refuſal</hi> of it can be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alledged as an argument of <hi>grace</hi> in him. Finally, It is very remarkable
what Parſon <hi>Matthews</hi> the laſt of the Witneſſes here Depoſeth, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That
though <hi>Turbervil</hi> had a mind to quit the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> being (as he
ſaid) convinced by the Arguments <hi>Matthews</hi> gave him, of the excellency of the
<hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Church;</hi> yet he would never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Then he Recapitulated the whole Evidence (already ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied)

permit. He reminded their Lordſhips of the ſeveral points wherein
he had proved the Witneſſes <hi>Forſworn:</hi> He recounted their ſayings,

inſiſted upon the <hi>Infamy</hi> of the Witneſſes, and Wickedneſs of their

               <p>The <hi>Managers</hi> therefore argued, <q>They had made it plain and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the beginning of the <hi>Tryal,</hi> by the Teſtimonies of fix poſitive
<hi>Witneſſes;</hi> by the <hi>Declaration</hi> of both Houſes of <hi>Parliament;</hi> by
<hi>Coleman</hi>'s <hi>Letters; by the Tryal and Conviction of other Traytors;</hi> that
there was a general Deſign amongſt the Papiſts, to introduce their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
By raiſing of <hi>Armies, murdering the King, and ſubverting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THe <hi>Papiſts</hi> anſwer: It is clear and manifeſt from the Reaſons given, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
anſwered, in the Preamble to this <hi>Tryal;</hi> That there never was
any ſuch general <hi>Deſign,</hi> any ſuch <hi>Armies</hi> raiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> amongſt the <hi>Papists.</hi>
Theſe being the meer groundleſs Suggeſtions of <hi>Infamous Men,</hi> whom <hi>Lucre and
Malice</hi> inſtigated to <hi>Perjury againſt Innocent Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe <hi>Managers</hi> farther argued, <q>It was neceſſary this <hi>great Deſign</hi> of
the Papiſts ſhould be managed by the greateſt Perſons amongſt
them: Now my <hi>L. Stafford</hi> was a man whoſe <hi>Quality and Merit</hi> might
well entitle him to an Office as great as <hi>Pay-maſter General</hi> to the Army;
From whence they inferred, That the particular Evidence given herein
againſt my <hi>Lord,</hi> was highly credible.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THe <hi>Papiſts</hi> anſwer: It is a wreſted Inference, and that alſo bottomed upon a
falſe <hi>ſuppoſition; For firſt,</hi> There never was (as is ſaid before) any ſuch <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,</hi>
nor by conſequence any <hi>Armies or Officers,</hi> other then what were the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
product of <hi>Perjured Men. Secondly,</hi> Though there had been ſuch a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi>
in general, as is here pretended; it is a ſtrangely far fetched conjecture
(ſurely not allowable in a caſe of Life and Death) that my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a Nobleman, muſt needs have a great, or indeed any <hi>part</hi> in it. Great
<hi>Offices</hi> (eſpecially amongſt Traitors) are not uſually committed to the beſt
<hi>Born,</hi> but to the beſt <hi>Qualified</hi> for ſuch employments. Now all the World
that knew my Lord, his Humour, his Condition, his Economy in Money mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
will avouch, (ſo incongruous are the Witneſſes in their <hi>Lyes,</hi>) there was
not peradventure amongſt all the Perſons of Quality, <hi>Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> one
leſs proper then he for <hi>Pay-maſter General to an Army.</hi> In fine, If there were
a <hi>Plot</hi> in general, 'tis no neceſſary conſequence my Lord was Guilty. But if
there were none (as moſt certainly there was not) 'tis abſolute demonſtration
my Lord was <hi>Innocent.</hi>

               <p>THe <hi>Managers</hi> argued,<note place="margin">Page 170.</note> 
                  <q>They had amply proved by their Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,

had juſtified the lawfulneſs, and incited their Votaries, to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice

hereunto, whenever my <hi>Lord</hi> undertook any Treaſonable <hi>Deſigns,</hi>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48868:22"/>
them, then it was he uttered the Treaſon of <hi>Killing the King.</hi> Theſe
notable Circumſtances muſt needs (ſay they) render credible the

But the Credit of theſe Witneſſes are queſtioned; How is that made out? <hi>Why,
by the Trayterous</hi> Sermons <hi>and Diſcourſes which they heard.</hi> Thus ſtill the Queſtion
is begged, and nothing proved but by <hi>bare ſwearing, peremptory ſwearing,</hi> of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
men, without any face of one ſingle <hi>Circumſtance</hi> to ſupport their Evidence,
other than what dependeth on the ſame <hi>ſwearing:</hi> As if thoſe that ſtick not to
ſwear a <hi>falſe Oath,</hi> ſhould ſtick at <hi>Circumſtances</hi> to ſecond their <hi>Perjury.</hi> Had the
<hi>Managers</hi> flouriſhed upon the <hi>Honeſty</hi> of the Witneſſes; the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs</hi> of their
Lives; the <hi>Integrity</hi> of their Manners; their diſ-engagement from <hi>Self-interest;</hi>
the Circumſtances inducing a <hi>probability,</hi> diſtinct from the bare Oaths, (things
neceſſary to a legal Conviction) the <hi>Tryal</hi> would have had another appearence.
It is therefore again urged, That there are ſuch Wretches as <hi>Knights of the Post.</hi>
That men may, and often do, break <hi>God's</hi> great Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not
bear falſe Witneſs againſt thy Neighbour.</hi> That wicked Perſons, of <hi>loſt Conſciences</hi> and
<hi>desperate Fortunes,</hi> are moſt propenſe to commit this Crime. That this Propenſion
is much augmented by an aſſured proſpect of <hi>Indempnities</hi> from Puniſhment, and
advantage of <hi>Gain.</hi> And conſequently, the bare, and otherwiſe improbable,
Oaths of ſuch men, ſo circumſtanced, cannot (eſpecially in matters of Life and
Death) be credited againſt honeſt and vertuous <hi>Perſons;</hi> nay againſt whole <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
without a dreadful hazard of Injuſtice. But there will be a further occaſion to
ſpeak of theſe alledged Trayterous <hi>Sermons</hi> and Diſcourſes, when we come to

by my <hi>Lord,</hi> (the other of his Queries not being admitted diſputable)
(<hi>viz.) Whether two Witneſſes be neceſſary to every Overt-act, in point of

               <p>After this,<note place="margin">My Lord's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Addreſs.</note> my <hi>Lord</hi> petitioned the Court (as a peculiar favour)
That he might offer ſome things to their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> Conſideration, the
purport of which was, <q>That he had proved direct <hi>Perjury</hi> upon all
the three Witneſſes againſt him: That,<note place="margin">Page 198.</note> as well at the inſtance of his
Wife, Daughter and Friends, as out of <hi>ſincerity of Conſcience,</hi> he would,
in the preſence of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> declare to them, <hi>All that he knew:</hi>
That he verily believed there had been in former times <hi>Plots</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
againſt the Crown and <hi>Government,</hi> (as the <hi>Gun-powder-Treaſon, &amp;c.</hi>
owned by the Traytors themſelves at their death) wherein ſome <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks,</hi> as well as others, might be concerned; which <hi>Plots</hi>
he from his heart (as both his Duty and Religion taught him) <hi>deteſted
and abhorred:</hi> That it was ever indeed his opinion, That an <hi>Act of
Comprehenſion</hi> for <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtants,</hi> and a Tolleration for <hi>Roman
Catholicks</hi> (yet ſo as not to admit them into any <hi>Offices</hi> of Profit or
<hi>Dignity</hi>) would much conduce to the happineſs of the Nation; But
this not otherwiſe to be procured or deſired, then by a free conſent of
the <hi>King, Lords, and Commons, in Parliament aſſembled:</hi> That he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read or knew of <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, or Conſultations for Tolleration,
till he ſaw the Letters themſelves in the Printed <hi>Tryal:</hi> How far <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was Criminal he did not know, but he believed he did that which
was not juſtifiable by <hi>Law:</hi> That, as to the damnable Doctrine of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48868:23"/>
                     <hi>King-killing,</hi> If he were of any <hi>Church</hi> whatſoever, and found that
to be its <hi>Principle,</hi> he would leave it. That he knew the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
he was under, in being forced, alone, to ſtand a conteſt with the
Learned Gentlemen the <hi>Mannagers,</hi> who have thoſe great helps of
Memory, Parts, and Underſtanding in the Law, all which he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
That therefore he hoped their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> would not conclude
barely upon the manner, either of his; or their expreſſions. But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
debating the merits of the Cauſe in it ſelf, would pleaſe to
be his <hi>Councel,</hi> as well as his <hi>Judges.</hi> That ſeeing he was to be Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or Condemned by their Lordſhips Judgement; He knew they
would <hi>lay their hands upon their Heart, Conſult their Conſciences, and
their Honours;</hi> And then he doubted not, they would do what was
juſt and equitable; That (with ſubmiſſion to their Lordſhips) he thought
it hard meaſure, and contrary to <hi>Law,</hi> that any one ſhould be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
above two years, without being admitted to <hi>Tryal;</hi> And
that it was of evil conſequence for any one to have Juſtice denyed
him, ſo long till his Opponents had found occaſion to gain their
ends; That however thoſe <hi>large Allowances, and Rewards granted to
the Witneſſes, for Swearing,</hi> might peradventure be an effect of His
<hi>Majeſties Grace and Bounty;</hi> yet it was not eaſily conceivable, how
the hopes and promiſes of ſo great Sums ſhould not prove to diſſolute,
indigent Perſons, ſtrong <hi>Allurements</hi> and temptations to <hi>Perjury.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
That the defence he had made, he owed it to the worth and
<hi>dignity</hi> of his Family; He owed it to his dear <hi>Wife and Children;</hi> (at
which words he was obſerved to weep,) He owed it to his <hi>Innocenſe;</hi>
He owed it to <hi>God,</hi> the Author of Life. That he confided, their
Lordſhips would duly reflect, what a dreadful thing <hi>Murder</hi> is, and
the <hi>Bloud of Innocents:</hi> And that he verily believed none of the <hi>Houſe
of Commons,</hi> deſired his Death for a Crime of which he was not Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
That he hoped their Lordſhips would not permit him to be run
down by the <hi>ſhouts of the Rable, (the Emblem of our paſt Calamity.) It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in the late times with the Lord</hi> Stafford, <hi>and ſo continued, till it
ended in the Death of the King, the moſt execrable Murder, that ever
was committed; And where this will end</hi> (ſaid he,) <hi>God knows.</hi> To
conclude, He again declared in the preſence of God, of his Angels,
of their Lordſhips, and all who heard him, That he was intirely
<hi>Innocent</hi> of what was laid to his charge; That he left it to their
Lordſhips to do <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and with all ſubmiſſion reſigned himſelf to
them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this diſcourſe of my <hi>Lords,</hi> the <hi>Mannagers</hi> returned for anſwer:
That his Lordſhips laſt Addreſs was not regular, nor according to the
due <hi>method</hi> of proceedings; for if after his Lordſhip had <hi>ſummed</hi> up his
Evidence, and the <hi>Proſecutors</hi> had concluded theirs, he ſhould begin
that work again, and they by conſequence be admitted to reply, he
might ſtill <hi>rejoyn</hi> upon them, and ſo there would be no end of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
They therefore deſired this Indulgence granted to my <hi>Lord,</hi>
might not ſerve for a future Preſident.</p>

                  </note> and the Court doth award it, <q>That
you go to the place from whence you came, from thence you muſt
be drawn upon an Hurdle to the place of Execution; when you come
there, you muſt be Hanged up by the Neck, but not till you are
Dead, for you muſt be cut down Alive; your Privy Members muſt
be cut off; And your Bowels Ript up before your Face, and thrown
into the Fire: Then your Head muſt be ſevered from your Body, and
your Body divided into four Quarters. And theſe muſt be at the
diſpoſal of the King. <hi>And God Almighty have mercy on your Soul.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>My Lord received this diſmal Sentence, with a meek and reſigned
Countenance: He declared in the preſence of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> he had
no malice in his Heart to them that had Condemned him: But free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forgave them all.</p>
               <p>He made one, and only one humble requeſt to their Lordſhips,

Children, and Friends might be permitted to come at him. My <hi>Lord

the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> the uſual Aſſembly of <hi>Doctors</hi> being met in Solemn
manner, in the <hi>Hall</hi> of the <hi>Sorbon Colledge,</hi> was heard the relation of
the Maſters of the ſame <hi>Faculty</hi> deputed for that end, who declared,
that in thoſe two above-mentioned Chapters, theſe propoſitions were
contained. <hi>That the</hi> Pope <hi>can puniſh Kings and Princes, with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Penalties, and Depoſe and Deprive them, of their Kingdoms for
the crime of</hi> Hereſie, <hi>and free their Subjects from their obedience; And
that it had been always the cuſtom in the Church; And for other cauſes
alſo, as for faults, if it be expedient; If the Princes be negligent; For
the inſufficiency, and unprofitableneſs of their Perſons; Likewiſe that the
Pope has right and power over Spirituals; and all Temporals alſo, and
that both the powers, Spiritual and Temporal are in him by Divine right;
That it was to be believed, that Power was granted to the Church and
its Chief Paſtors, to puniſh with Temporal Penalties,</hi> (Princes) <hi>the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48868:25"/>
of Divine and Humane Laws, eſpecially if the Crime be</hi> Hereſie.
They ſaid likewiſe, that the ſame <hi>Sanctarelus</hi> did affirm, <hi>That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
were ſubject to ſecular</hi> Princes, de facto, non de jure; <hi>by Fact,
not by Right;</hi> Moreover, <hi>That as ſoon as the</hi> Pope <hi>is installed, all
Princes begin to be ſubject unto him.</hi> Laſtly, they related that he,
(<hi>Sanctarelus</hi>) expounded the words of <hi>Christ, Whatſoever ye ſhall
bind upon Earth,</hi> &amp;c. To be underſtood not only of the <hi>Spiritual,</hi>
but of the <hi>Temporal Power:</hi> That he impoſes upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his words, by withdrawing the Negation; and upon many,
Authors cited by him. They related many other things out of the
ſaid <hi>Sanctarelus,</hi> which ſeemed to them very well to deſerve the
grave <hi>Animadverſions and Cenſure of the Faculty.</hi> The matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

To <hi>accuſe men</hi> as guilty in <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> which they never own'd, is the ſame
thing, as to condemn them for <hi>matters of Fact,</hi> which they never did.</p>
            <p>You preſs the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and ſay, ſome of our <hi>General Councils,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Papal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi>
and many of our <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> aſſert the fore-mentioned <hi>Principles.</hi>
Sir, I have been inſtructed in the <hi>Articles of my Faith,</hi> and I acknowledge the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Authority</hi> of <hi>General Councils:</hi> yet I profeſs I never learnt, or found aſſerted in
any of them, any ſuch <hi>Principles.</hi> And I propoſe unto you this plain and ſhort
<hi>Dilemma;</hi> Either the above-named Principles are eſteem'd by us as <hi>matters of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48868:25"/>
Faith,</hi> or not: If <hi>they be,</hi> what further can be required of us, than to <hi>deny</hi> and
<hi>forſake</hi> ſuch a <hi>Faith?</hi> And this we conſtantly do. But if <hi>they be not matters of
Catholick Faith,</hi> nor owned by us as ſuch, why are <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as <hi>Catholicks,</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for them? why is our <hi>Religion</hi> perſecuted on that account? Let thoſe, in
God's Name, if any therebe, of what <hi>Religion</hi> ſoever, who <hi>bold ſuch Tenents, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for them:</hi> why ſhould the <hi>Innocent</hi> be involv'd with the <hi>Guilty?</hi> there is neither
<hi>Reaſon</hi> nor <hi>Juſtice</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>Hereunto ſome Perſons (I hope out of zeal and miſ-information,<note place="margin">An Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</note> rather than
malice) ſtick not to ſay, That <hi>Dispenſations,</hi> and I know not what <hi>Indulgences</hi> and
<hi>Pardons,</hi> whereby to legitimate the Crimes of <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Forſwearing,</hi> when the
Intereſt of our Church requires it, is a <hi>main part</hi> of our <hi>Religion:</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
the <hi>denial</hi> of our <hi>Principles,</hi> is <hi>no ſufficient Justification of our Innocence.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
<hi>Firſt,</hi> It is in the higheſt meaſure cenſorious in any one, to <hi>impoſe</hi> upon all
our <hi>Anceſtors,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſwered.</note> and the greateſt part of mankind, who are, or have been ſo long
together Members of our <hi>Religion,</hi> ſuch an exceſs of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> as muſt
needs have perverted all <hi>Humane Society. Secondly,</hi> If we could lawfully <hi>deny the
Principles of our Faith</hi> when Intereſt requires, why have we loſt our <hi>Eſtates,</hi> our
<hi>Liberties,</hi> our <hi>Lives</hi> for the profeſſion of it? To what purpoſe are <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Teſts</hi>
deviſed to intangle us? How impertinently is the frequenting the <hi>Proteſtant
Church,</hi> and <hi>Receiving the Communion,</hi> propoſed unto us, and <hi>refuſed by us? Thirdly,</hi>
Though many men may be induced to <hi>Lie,</hi> and <hi>Forſwear,</hi> when they have ſome
hopes or proſpect thereby of <hi>Temporal Advantage;</hi> yet, that perſons <hi>dying for
their Conſcience and Religion,</hi> (as divers have done, and thoſe <hi>no Fools,</hi> even by the
Confeſſion of our Adverſaries) ſhould be ſo ſtupendiouſly <hi>ſottiſh and mad,</hi> either
to imagine, that <hi>Lies and Perjuries,</hi> for <hi>concealment of Treaſon, Murder, Maſſacre,</hi>
and <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of others by <hi>Fire and Sword,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Acts of Virtue, pleaſing to
God, dispenſable by the</hi> Pope, and <hi>Meritorious of Heaven;</hi> or that, on the contrary,
<hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>believing</hi> (as needs they muſt) ſuch <hi>Monſters</hi> and <hi>Horrours</hi> to be <hi>odious</hi>
and <hi>deteſtable</hi> in the ſight both of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> they ſhould nevertheleſs, upon the
very brink of <hi>Eternity, wittingly and willingly,</hi> caſt themſelves <hi>headlong</hi> into an <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Damnation;</hi> and this at a time when they might have ſaved both <hi>Bodies</hi> and
<hi>Souls,</hi> by meerly diſcharging a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> in acknowledging the <hi>Truth,</hi> and
becoming <hi>honeſt men.</hi> This, I ſay, is <hi>Inhumane,</hi> and contradictory to all <hi>Senſe</hi> and
<hi>Reaſon</hi> to believe.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, I come to what you ſo often, and ſo earneſtly preſs me to, <hi>viz.</hi>
to ſatisfie the world,<note place="margin">The intent of this Epiſtle.</note> and clear <hi>my ſelf,</hi> my <hi>Fellow Sufferers,</hi> and my <hi>Religion,</hi>
from the imputation laid upon us, on pretence of ſuch <hi>Principles,</hi> by a true and
candid <hi>Explanation</hi> of my <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> in the main points of <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Loyalty,</hi> controverted between <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as they ſeverally relate

            <head>SECT. IV. My Lord's Declaration before the Houſe of Lords after
his Condemnation.</head>
            <p>SOon after my <hi>Lords Tryal,</hi> ſeveral of his Relations and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
(ſome out of zeal againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and others out of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to my <hi>Lord,</hi>) were daily urgent with him to make Diſcoveries of
all he knew, as the only remaining remedy whereby to ſave his Life,
regain the <hi>Kings</hi> favour, and attract the applauſe of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
My Lord always reply'd, <hi>He was moſt willing and ready out of
a meer ſenſe of</hi> Duty <hi>and</hi> Conſcience (independent of any Temporal
advantage to himſelf) <hi>to diſcover with all imaginable Sincerity, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48868:28"/>
utmost of what he knew, either to the</hi> King, <hi>or</hi> Houſe of Lords, <hi>when ever
they required it.</hi> The <hi>Lords</hi> being informed hereof, Ordered his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
before them the next day. When he came, and had audience
granted, he made his acknowledgments to this effect. <q>That he thought
it no crime in any Man to wiſh his Neighbour might be of the ſame
<hi>Religion</hi> wherein he himſelf hoped to be ſaved; Nay to ſeek, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it by ſuch ways and means, as the Laws of God, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
allow. That there had been at divers times, and on ſundry oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
endeavours uſed, and overtures made to obtain an <hi>Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi>
or at leaſt a <hi>Mitigation</hi> of Severities againſt <hi>Catholicks:</hi> But
this to be procured no otherwiſe then by Legal and <hi>Parliamentary</hi>
means. That he himſelf went to <hi>Breda,</hi> whilſt the <hi>King</hi> was there,
and propounded 100000 <hi>l.</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to take off the
penal Laws. That after the <hi>King</hi> came in, there was a Bill brought
into the Houſe, in favovr of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> but it was oppoſed by my
<hi>Lord Chancellour Hide.</hi> That there had likewiſe been framed by the
<hi>Lord Briſtol</hi> and others, (in order to the propoſing of them in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>)
ſeveral forms of <hi>Oaths,</hi> contained in ſuch terms as might fully
expreſs all <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> yet not entangle <hi>tender
Conſciences</hi> with Clauſes and Proviſoes, diſagreeable to <hi>Faith,</hi> and no
wiſe appertaining to <hi>Loyalty;</hi> but neither did this ſucceed. That
afterwards he had offered ſome propoſals, as well to the <hi>Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour</hi>
at his Houſe at <hi>Kenfington,</hi> as to the <hi>Duke of York,</hi> concerning
ſome lawful expedients, conducing to the good, (as he thought,)
both of <hi>Catholicks</hi> and the whole <hi>Nation.</hi> And alſo about <hi>Diſſolving</hi>
the long <hi>Parliament;</hi> the ſubſtance of which he likewiſe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to my <hi>Lord Sbaſtsbury,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>He doubted not, but that there
would come great advantages to the</hi> King <hi>by it.</hi> Theſe he avouched
were the chief, and only <hi>Deſigns</hi> he ever had, or knew of amongſt
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> for promoting their <hi>Religion;</hi> Of more then theſe he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
before <hi>Almighty God</hi> and their <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> he was wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</q>
But this <hi>Declaration</hi> not being ſatisfactory towards the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
any <hi>Damnable Conſpiracy,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> thought ſit without any
further Examination to remand him back to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this occaſion, there run about both <hi>Town and Countrey</hi> an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Rumor. That the <hi>Lord Stafford</hi> had now made a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Diſcovery</hi> of the whole <hi>Plot;</hi> And that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> could not for
the future have the Impudence to deny it, after the Confeſſion (though
to ſave his Life,) of ſo <hi>Honourable a Perſon;</hi> But this proved a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.
And by the way it was very obſervable, <hi>My Lords Adverſaries</hi>
took this falſe Alarm with ſo much eagerneſs and joy, as ſufficiently
denoted, they were not well aſſured of the truth of the former <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>

                        <p>IN the Name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.
Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> the Feaſt of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> I was
brought to my Tryal in <hi>Weſtminster-Hall</hi> before the Peers, <hi>Lord
Chancellor</hi> being <hi>High Steward;</hi> my Tryal continued until that day,
ſeaven-night the 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>December;</hi> upon that day I was found <hi>Guilty
of High Treaſon</hi> and condemned to die. I give God thanks for his
great mercy and goodneſs that he hath been pleaſed to think me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of this <hi>Sentence,</hi> in ſatisfaction for my other great and hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
which I have committed; And I hope that through the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>paſſion of our Savour Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and through his <hi>pretious bloud</hi>
and merits, he will be mercifully pleaſed to receive my <hi>Soul</hi> into eternal
<hi>Happineſs,</hi> in his preſence amongſt his <hi>Angels and Saints.</hi> I conceive
this <hi>Sentence</hi> is fallen upon me upon the account of the Religion that
I am of; If I had numbers of lives, I would loſe them all, rather
then forſake that Church, that I am of; and which I am well aſſured
that it maintains nothing but what is well warranted by the word of
God. I do with my whole heart forgive thoſe Perjured men that ſwore
ſo falſly againſt me; I wiſh them no greater puniſhment then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and to acknowledge the wrong they have done me; I do alſo
heartily forgive my Judges; and if any of them have given their <hi>Votes</hi>
contrary to their <hi>Conſciences, God</hi> for forgive them, I do it willingly.</p>
                        <p>HOw extremly ſhould I think my ſelf bound to the King if in this
Condition that I am brought into by the <hi>Perjury</hi> of Villains
that ſwore <hi>falſly</hi> for gain,<note place="margin">Another Note.</note> His Majeſty ſhould be graciouſly pleaſed
to grant me my life; But how infinitely beyond that hath His <hi>Divine
Majesty</hi> ſhewed his mercy and goodneſs to me, ſo many times pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thoſe great, and many offences, which the leaſt of them deſerved
an <hi>Fternal</hi> puniſhment. And of his infinite <hi>mercy</hi> hath been pleaſed
to preſerve me thus long from his juſt <hi>Judgments;</hi> And hath brought
me hither firſt a <hi>Priſoner,</hi> when I had not done any thing in the leaſt
by the <hi>Law</hi> to deſerve it; and now hath pleaſed to bring me to my
<hi>Condemnation:</hi> How inexplicable are his <hi>Mercies</hi> unto me; And if I
do not cordially and really repent, having this great time to recollect
my ſelf, nothing can excuſe me. Nay even at this time when I am
hourly looking to hear of the hour of my <hi>Execution,</hi> I have time by
his Omnipotent <hi>mercy</hi> to lay my <hi>Heart</hi> proſtrate on the ground, to
beg his <hi>Pardon,</hi> and acknowledg his infinite <hi>mercy</hi> and goodneſs;
<hi>God</hi> grant me grace to reflect as I ought on all theſe aſſurances, and
as I ought to do, love his <hi>Divinity</hi> and nothing created indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
of him; Nothing in this World but the Holy <hi>Trinity</hi> deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the whole love and <hi>Adoration</hi> of Mankind. <hi>God</hi> give me grace
to love him, and only him; And though I cannot do it ſo well as
otherwiſe I ought, yet I hope I do it what I can; And do firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
by his holy <hi>Grace</hi> I will to the uttermoſt of my power, ſo long
as it ſhall pleaſe him to give me my life, wholly and willingly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
my ſelf to his <hi>Holy will;</hi> and doubt not by his <hi>Grace</hi> but to find
more true delight in ſerving him, then ever I did in the vanities of the
World. <hi>All Glory Praiſe and Honour be given unto him for all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

THere was likewiſe found in his Chamber, this following Prayer or
Reſignation. Thou haſt ſaid <hi>O Lord, he that loves Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>more then me is not worthy of me.</hi> I acknowledge moſt dear <hi>Lord,</hi>
that I love my <hi>Wife and Children,</hi> as much as a loving <hi>Husband</hi> and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

own Life to boot; I willingly render up, and forſake both <hi>for the
love of thee;</hi> and rather then to offend thee, though by the contrary
I may have life and all worldly advantages both for my ſelf and them.

               <p>WHen the hour appointed for his Death, drew near, he exſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with ſome impatience the arrival of Mr. <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Friends that were about him, he ought not to haſten his own
death, yet he thought the time long till they came for him. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
then with him in his Chamber put him in mind, that it was a
cold day, and that his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> would do well to put on a Cloak or
Coat to keep him warm; He anſwered; He would; for (ſaid he) I
may perhaps ſhake for cold, but I truſt in <hi>God,</hi> never for fear. After
ſome time ſpent in Spiritual diſcourſes, at length about Ten a Clock,
word was brought him, That Mr. <hi>Lieutenant</hi> waited for him below;
upon which he ſweetly ſaluted his Friends, bidding them not grieve
for him; for this was the <hi>happieſt</hi> day of all his Life; then he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
went down, and walked along by the <hi>Lieutenants</hi> Chair (who
had the Gout) through a lane of Soldiers to the <hi>Barrs</hi> without the
<hi>Tower.</hi> There the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> delievered him to the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> and they
from thence Guarded him to the <hi>Scaffold</hi> erected on <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi> All
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48868:33"/>
the way as he paſſed, ſeveral thouſands of People crowded to ſee him;
many civilly ſaluted him; and few there were, amongſt that vaſt
number, whoſe hearts were not <hi>touched</hi> and mollified with <hi>Compaſſion</hi>
for him. Having mounted the <hi>Scaffold</hi> there appeared in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
ſuch an unuſual vivacity, ſuch a (<hi>Chearfulneſs,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Confidence,</hi>
ſuch a <hi>Candor,</hi> as if the <hi>Innocence</hi> of his Soul had ſhined through his
Body. Nothing of that Mortal paleneſs, Nothing of thoſe Reluctances,
Convulſions, and Agonies, incident to perſons in his condition, could
in the leaſt be perceived in him. He looked Death in the face with
ſo undaunted a Reſolution, as gave many occaſion to ſay; <hi>Grace had
left in him, no Reſentments of Nature.</hi> After a ſhort pauſe, viewing
the People, and finding them attentive to what he ſhould ſay, he ſtept
to one ſide of the <hi>Scaffold,</hi> and with a <hi>Graceful</hi> Air, and intelligible

of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> hold it, but as able and Learned as they have
Written againſt it: But it was not pretended to be the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> that is, any <hi>Point of Catholick Faith:</hi> Wherefore I do here in
my <hi>Conſcience</hi> declare, that it is my true and real <hi>Judgement,</hi> That the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48868:34"/>
ſame <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Depoſing Kings,</hi> is contrary to the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi>
of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> Injurious to <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> and conſequently
would be in me or any other of His Majeſties Subjects, <hi>Impious</hi> and
<hi>Damnable.</hi> I believe and profeſs, That there is <hi>One God, One Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
One Holy Catholick Church,</hi> of which through the <hi>Mercy, Grace,</hi>
and <hi>Goodneſs of God,</hi> I die a member.</p>
                  <p>To my great and unſpeakable grief, I have offended <hi>God</hi> in many
things, by many great <hi>Offences,</hi> but I give him moſt humble thanks, not
in any of thoſe <hi>Crimes</hi> of which I was <hi>Accuſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Members</hi> of either <hi>Houſe</hi> having liberty to propoſe in the
<hi>Houſe</hi> what they think fit for the good of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> accordingly I
propoſed what I thought fit, the <hi>Houſe</hi> is Judge of the fitneſs or unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it; and I think I never ſaid any thing that was unſitting
there, or contrary to the <hi>Law and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Parliament:</hi> for certainly
if I had, the <hi>Lords</hi> would, (as they might,) have puniſhed me: ſo I am
not culpable before <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is much reported of <hi>Indulgences, Diſpenſations,</hi> and <hi>Pardons,</hi> to
<hi>Murther, Rebel, Lie, Forſwear,</hi> and Commit ſuch other Crimes held
and given in the <hi>Church;</hi> I do here profeſs in the preſence of <hi>God,</hi> I
never Learned, Believed, or Practiſed any ſuch thing, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
And I ſpeak this without any Equivocation, or Reſervation
whatſoever: And certainly were I guilty, either my ſelf, or knew of
any one that were Guilty, whoſoever, that were ſo, of any of thoſe
<hi>Crimes</hi> of which I am accuſed, I were not only the greateſt Fool imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
but a perfect Mad-man, and as wicked as any of thoſe, that ſo
falſly have accuſed me; If I ſhould not diſcover any ill Deſign I
knew in any kind, and ſo upon Diſcovery ſave my Life; I have ſo
often had ſo fair occaſions propoſed unto me; And ſo am guilty of
Self-Murther, which is a moſt grievous and hainous Sin; and though
I was laſt Impeached at the <hi>Lords Bar,</hi> yet I have great grounds to
believe, that I was firſt brought to <hi>Tryal,</hi> on the belief, that to ſave
my Life, I would make ſome great <hi>Diſcovery;</hi> And truly ſo I would,
had I known any ſuch thing of any ill <hi>Deſign</hi> or <hi>Illegal Dangerous Plot,</hi>
either of my ſelf or any other <hi>Perſon</hi> whatſoever, without any <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</hi>
But had I a thouſand Lives, I would loſe them all, rather
then <hi>Falſly accuſe,</hi> either my ſelf or any other whatſoever. And if I
had known of any <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and ſhould thus deny it, as I do now upon
my <hi>Salvation,</hi> at this time, I ſhould have no hope of <hi>Salvation,</hi> which
now I have through the <hi>Merits</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do beſeech <hi>God to bleſs His Majeſtly,</hi> who is my <hi>Lawful King and
Sovereign,</hi> whom I was always by all <hi>Laws Humane and Divine, bound
to Obey,</hi> and I am ſure that no <hi>Power upon Earth,</hi> either ſingly or all
together, can legally allow me, or any body elſe, <hi>to lift up a Hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, or his Legal Authority.</hi> I do hold that the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of
the <hi>Government</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> is the only way to continue peace and
quietneſs; which <hi>God</hi> long continue.</p>
                  <p>Next to <hi>Treaſon,</hi> I hold <hi>Murther</hi> in <hi>Abhorrence,</hi> and have ever done,
and do; And I do ſincerely profeſs, that if I could at this time free my
ſelf Immediatly, and <hi>Establiſh</hi> what <hi>Religion</hi> I would, and what <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
I would, and make my ſelf as <hi>great</hi> as I could wiſh, and all by
the <hi>death</hi> of one of theſe <hi>Fellows,</hi> that by their <hi>Perjuries</hi> have brought
me to the place where I am, I ſo much <hi>abhor</hi> to be the cauſe of any
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48868:34"/>
                     <hi>Mans death,</hi> that I would not any way be the cauſe of their <hi>Murther;</hi>
how much leſs would I endeavour the <hi>Aſſaſſination</hi> of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi>
whom I hold to be a <hi>Gracious a King</hi> as ever this or any other <hi>Nation</hi>
had; And under whom the <hi>People</hi> may enjoy their <hi>Liberties,</hi> as much
as ever any did; And if it pleaſe <hi>God</hi> to grant him <hi>Life and Happineſs,</hi>
according as I have always <hi>Wiſhed and Prayed</hi> for, I am <hi>morally</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that he, and all his <hi>Dominions,</hi> will be as <hi>happy and proſperous</hi>
as ever <hi>People</hi> were; Which I beſeech <hi>God</hi> grant.</p>
                  <p>I do moſt humbly ask <hi>Pardon</hi> of the <hi>Almighty and All-merciful God,</hi>
for all the great <hi>Offences</hi> I have committed againſt his <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi>
and I know he would not have the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Confuſion</hi> of a <hi>Sinner,</hi>
but that he may <hi>Repent and Live:</hi> In that aſſurance I hope, knowing
he never deſpiſeth a <hi>Contrite Heart;</hi> And though I have not ſo feeling
a <hi>Contrition</hi> as I would, yet I have it as well as I can; and I doubt not
but that <hi>God</hi> will accept of the <hi>Good Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do deſire that all <hi>People</hi> will forgive me any <hi>Injury</hi> that I have
done them in any thing, either <hi>Wilfully</hi> or by <hi>Chance,</hi> and I do hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
forgive all <hi>People</hi> in this <hi>World</hi> that have <hi>Injured</hi> me; I forgive
even thoſe <hi>Perjured Men,</hi> that ſo <hi>Falſly</hi> have brought me hither by
their <hi>Perjuries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do now upon my <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> aver, That I never ſpoke
one Word either to <hi>Oates</hi> or <hi>Turbervil,</hi> or to my knowledge ever ſaw
them, until my <hi>Tryal:</hi> And for <hi>Dugdale</hi> I never ſpoke unto him of
any thing but about a <hi>Foot-boy,</hi> or <hi>Foot-man,</hi> or <hi>Foot-race;</hi> and never
was then alone with him: All the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> that I wiſh them, is,
that they may repent and acknowledge the <hi>Wrong</hi> that they have
done me; then it will appear how <hi>Innocent I am: God</hi> forgive them!
I have a great Confidence that it will pleaſe <hi>Almighty God,</hi> and that he
will in a ſhort time bring <hi>Truth</hi> to <hi>Light;</hi> then You and all the <hi>World</hi>
will ſee and know what <hi>injury</hi> they have done me.</p>
                  <p>I hope that I have made it appear, that I have ſome <hi>Conſcience;</hi> for
if I had none, certainly I would have ſaved my <hi>Life</hi> by acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my ſelf <hi>Guilty;</hi> which I could have done, though I know I am
not in the leaſt <hi>Guilty.</hi> And I having ſome <hi>Conſcience,</hi> make very ill
uſe of it; for I throw my ſelf into <hi>Eternal Pain,</hi> by thus plainly and
conſtantly denying thus at my <hi>Death,</hi> the knowledge of what I am
accuſed of in the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid thus much in diſcharge of my <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and do aver
upon my Salvation, what I have ſaid to be really true.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay little of my <hi>Tryal;</hi> and whether it were all according to
the known Law, I am too much a Party to ſay much of it; if it were
not ſo, <hi>God</hi> forgive him or them that were the cauſe of it.</p>
                  <p>My Judges were all <hi>Perſons of Honour,</hi> who were all as much
bound to Judge rightly, as if they had been upon <hi>Oath</hi> upon
what was legally proved; And not to <hi>Vote</hi> but according as in
their <hi>Conſciences</hi> they were ſatisfied; And if any of them did
otherwiſe, upon any account whatſoever, I beſeech <hi>God</hi> forgive
them; I do heartily.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall end with my <hi>hearty Prayers</hi> for the <hi>happineſs</hi> of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi>
that he may enjoy all happineſs in this <hi>World, and the World to come;</hi>
and govern his <hi>People</hi> according to the <hi>Laws of God,</hi> and that the
<hi>People</hi> may be ſenſible what a <hi>Bleſſing God</hi> hath ſo miraculouſly given
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48868:35"/>
them, and obey him as they ought. I ask <hi>Pardon with a proſtrate
Heart of Almighty God,</hi> for all the <hi>great Offences</hi> that I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt his <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> and hope through the <hi>Merits
and Paſſion of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to obtain everlaſting Happineſs,
into whoſe hands I commit my <hi>Spirit,</hi> asking <hi>Pardon</hi> of every
<hi>Perſon</hi> that I have done any wrong unto: I do freely forgive
all that have any ways wronged me; I do with all the <hi>Devotion
and Repentance</hi> that I can, humbly invoke the mercy of our <hi>Bleſſed
Saviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I beſeech <hi>God</hi> not to <hi>Revenge my Innocent Bloud upon the Nation,</hi>
or on thoſe that were <hi>the Cauſe of it,</hi> with my <hi>laſt Breath.</hi> I do with
my <hi>laſt Breath truly aſſert my Innocency,</hi> and hope the <hi>Omnipotent All-ſeeing
Juſt God</hi> will deal with me accordingly.</p>
               </q>
               <p>HIS <hi>Speech</hi> being ended, he delivered ſeveral Written Copies
of it to the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and others near him, (one of which,
Writ with his own hand, he ſent to the <hi>King,</hi>) Then he returned
to the middle of the <hi>Scaffold,</hi> where, encompaſſed by his <hi>Catholick
Friends;</hi> He kneeled down, and reverently making the <hi>Sign</hi> of the
<hi>Croſs,</hi> pronounced aloud, with exceeding <hi>Devotion,</hi> this following
<hi>Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AGnoſco (Domine</hi> Jeſu) <hi>peccata mea, multa &amp; magna, pro
quibus timeo; ſed ſpero in</hi> miſericordiâ &amp; miſerationibus tuis,
quarum non eſt numerus: Secundum igitur magnam miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiam
tuam miſerere mei, &amp; ſecundum multitudinem mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerationum
tuarum dele iniquitatem meam. <hi>Si Peccata mea magnaſunt,
major eſt miſericordia tua: Si multae, infinitae ſunt miſerationes tuae:
Si ego commiſi, unde me poſſis condemnare, Tu non amiſisti, unde potes, &amp;
ſoles ſalvare. Credenti in potentiâ tuâ &amp; dicenti,</hi> Domine ſi vis, potes
me mundare, <hi>tu ſtatim reſpondiſti:</hi> Volo; mundare: <hi>Credo, quod ipſe
credidit; Spero quod ipſe ſperavit; Imploro quod ipſe imploravit. Dic igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
animae meae,</hi> Salus tua ego ſum: Sana me, Domine <hi>Jeſu,</hi> &amp; ſanabor:
Salvum me fac, &amp; ſalvus ero, &amp; miſericordias tuas in aeternum cantabo. Ne
projicias me igitur à faciê tuâ, &amp; Spiritum ſanctum tuum ne auferas
à me: Sed redde mihi laetitiam Salutaris tui, &amp; Spiritu principali con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirma
me. <hi>Tu dixisti, dulciſſime</hi> Jeſu, Convertimini ad me, &amp; ego
convertar ad vos: <hi>Ego me, ex toto corde meo, ex totâ animâ, ex totâ
mente meâ, converto ad te; Converte te igitur miſericordiſſime, ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignum
famulum tuum quem pretioſo ſanguine redemiſti. Tu dixisti,</hi>
Omnis qui confitebitur me, coram hominibus conſitebor, &amp; ego eum
coram Patre meo, qui in coelis eſt. <hi>Ego te, &amp; Sanctam tuam Religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
Catholicam vivens confiteor, &amp; moriens, adjuvante gratiâ tuâ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitebor:
dignare me igitur ſuſcipere, &amp; ponfiteri coram patre tuo, qui in Coelis
eſt. In thâ promiſſione, non in meâ juſtitiâ confido. Vitam quam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disti
mihi, libenter tibi reddo ſecundum beneplacitum tuum: In manus
tuas commendo Spiritum meum, qui moriens Spiritum tuum in aeterni Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris
manus commendaſti. In pace igitur, in id ipſum dormiam &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcam,
quoniam tu Domine, ſingulariter in ſpe conſtituisti me.</hi> Amen,
<hi>Jeſu,</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <q>I acknowledge (O <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi>) my Sins to be many, and great, for
which I am affraid; but I hope in thy mercy, and commiſerations
which are without number. Have mercy therefore on me according to
thy great mercy, and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies,
blot out mine iniquity. If my Sins be great, thy mercy is greater; If many,
thy Commiſerations are infinite. If I have committed that, for which
thou mayeſt Condemn me, thou haſt not loſt that, by which thou canſt,
and art accuſtomed to Save. To him, that believed in thy Power, and
ſaid, <hi>O Lord, If thou wilt, thou cauſt make me clean;</hi> Thou preſently
anſweredſt, <hi>I will; Be thou clean:</hi> I believe, what he believed, I hope,
for what he hoped, I Implored what he Implored. Say therefore to
my Soul, <hi>I am thy Salvation:</hi> Heal Me, O Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and I ſhall be
healed; Save Me, and I ſhall be ſaved, and I will ſing forth thy mercy
for all eternity. Caſt me not therefore away from thy Face, and take
not thy Holy Spirit from me; But render me the joy of thy Salvation,
and with thy Principal Spirit Confirm me. Thou haſt ſaid, O moſt
Sweet <hi>Jeſus, Turn to Me, and I will turn to You:</hi> I turn my ſelf to Thee
with my whole Heart, with my whole Soul, with my whole Mind;
Turn thy ſelf therefore (O moſt Merciful) unto me, thy unworthy
Servant, whom thou haſt redeemed with thy moſt Precious Bloud.
Thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Every one who ſhall confeſs me before Men,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>TO this Prayer he adjoyned ſeveral other Pious Ejaculations,
wherein with ſingular Compunction, and aboundance of <hi>Tears;</hi>
he Implored the <hi>Divine</hi> Mercy and Pardon for his Sins paſt; He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
his Soul to his dear <hi>Redeemer Jeſus;</hi> He bleſſed his <hi>Holy
Name;</hi> And offered his Life to him, a willing <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Gratitude,
Piety, and Love.</p>
               <p>Remaining ſtill on his knees, he again proteſted his <hi>Innocence</hi> with
all the aſſeverations a dying Chriſtian is capable to make. Then riſing
up, he a ſecond time ſaluted the people and walking to each ſide of
the <hi>Scaffold,</hi> 
                  <q>Told them, they had as good and gracious a <hi>King</hi> as
ever Reigned. He earneſtly exhorted them to be faithful and conſtant
in their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him. And that no pretence whatſoever ſhould
withdraw them from their <hi>Duty.</hi> He wiſhed with a feeling reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that none might be leſs Loyal to His <hi>Majeſty</hi> then he had been.</q>
And it was very remarkable in him; He never ſeemed tranſported with
any fervours, or Extaſies, but either in his Prayers to <hi>God,</hi> or in his
expreſſions of Loyalty to the <hi>King;</hi> Then indeed he was all Flame,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48868:36"/>
and you might read in his very Eyes, the tender Emotions, and Zeal
of his heart. He likewiſe aſſured them upon his Salvation, he knew
no <hi>deſign the Duke of York</hi> ever had againſt the <hi>King,</hi> But that he had
behaved himſelf for ought he knew, as a loving Loyal <hi>Brother</hi> ought
to do; Then he again declared his own <hi>Innocence,</hi> and deſired the
Prayers of all good Chriſtians for him; He Prayed to <hi>God</hi> heartily to
bleſs the <hi>King,</hi> and preſerve him from his Enemies; To bleſs the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
To bleſs, and be with them all there preſent, eſpecially the <hi>King's
Loyal Subjects;</hi> He begged <hi>Gods</hi> Mercy and Pardon for his Sins; He
asked forgiveneſs of all, and forgave all; beſeeching the <hi>Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
not to Revenge his <hi>Innocent Bloud</hi> upon the whole <hi>Kingdom;</hi> No,
not upon thoſe by whoſe <hi>Perjuries</hi> he was brought thither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom
he wiſhed from his Heart no other hurt, then that they ſhould repent,
and <hi>tell truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt he thus profeſſed his <hi>Loyaity,</hi> his <hi>Innocence,</hi> his <hi>Piety;</hi> Moſt
that heard him were touched with a ſenſible Compaſſion for him:
Some, as he Spoke, put off their Hats, and Bowed to him, in ſign
they Accorded to what he ſaid; Others by diſtinct Acclamations an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>We believe you my</hi> Lord; <hi>God bleſs you my</hi> Lord: <hi>Pray</hi> God
<hi>forgive him his Sins,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In this conjuncture a <hi>Protestant Minister</hi> accoſted him, ſaying, <hi>Have
you received no Indulgences from the</hi> Romiſh Church? <hi>Have you received no
Abſolution?</hi> To which my Lord anſwered, <hi>What have you to do with my</hi>
Religion? <hi>However I do ſay, the</hi> Roman Catholick Church <hi>allow's of
no Indulgences or Diſpenſations, Authorizing Treaſon, Murder, Lying, or Forſwearing; Nor have I received any</hi> Abſolution <hi>for ſuch ends. Pray
do not trouble your ſelf, nor me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then turning from the <hi>Parſon,</hi> he applyed himſelf to his Friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, whom he lovingly embraced, and with a pleaſant Voice
and Aſpect, bid them Adieu, for this World. Next he delivered his
Watch, two Rings off his Fingers, his Staff, and his <hi>Crucifix</hi> about
his Neck, as Legacies to ſeveral Friends: He deſired the Sheriffs that
ſuch Perſons as he nominated might have leave (without the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
Intermeddling) to aſſiſt him, and take care of his Body, which
was accordingly done: And his Gentleman ſtripping him of his Coat
and Peruke, put on his head a Silk Cap, and accommodated his hair,
Shirt, and Waiſtcoat, for the Execution. And now being ready for
<hi>Death</hi> both in Body and Mind, he chearfully ſubmitted himſelf to the
Block; before which firſt kneeling down, and making the <hi>Sign of the
Croſs,</hi> he recommended himſelf with raptures of Devotion to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> After this, he lay down as it were to try
the Block. And then (who could imagine it?) with a Stupendious
Courage, embraced the <hi>fatal Wood,</hi> as the dear <hi>Baſis,</hi> or <hi>Point,</hi> from
whence his Soul was now to take its flight to Immortal <hi>Glory.</hi> The
Heads-man put him in mind, that his Shirt and Waiſtcoat came too high;
Whereupon he raiſed himſelf up upon his Knees, and bid his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
put them lower. Whilſt this was Performing, he was heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
to breath forth ſeveral Acts of <hi>Prayer,</hi> as <hi>Sweet Jeſus receive my
Soul; Into thy hands O Lord I commend my Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. When his
Gentleman had finiſhed; He again laid down his head upon the Block,
perſevering ſtill in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and expecting the ſuddain and diſmal arreſt
of <hi>Death,</hi> with a courage (ſay the <hi>Papiſts) Divinely Elevated,</hi> a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48868:36"/>
conſtancy more then humane. No change in his <hi>Countenance;</hi> no
Quaking, or Trembling in any one <hi>Joynt of his Body,</hi> could be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
Thus he lay, or rather quietly reſted, upon the very <hi>Brink,</hi>
between <hi>Time and Eternity,</hi> a good ſpace; Till at length finding the
<hi>Head's-Man</hi> delayed the <hi>Execution</hi> of his <hi>Office;</hi> He once more raiſed
himſelf up upon his Knees, and with an aſpect, grave, (but ſtill ſerene
and Lively,) asked, <hi>Why they ſtaid?</hi> It was anſwered, <hi>For a Sign;
What Sign will you give Sir?</hi> He replyed, <hi>None at all; Take your own
time; God</hi>'s <hi>will be done; I am ready.</hi> The <hi>Head's-Man</hi> ſaid, <hi>I hope
you forgive me;</hi> He anſwered, <hi>I do.</hi> Then <hi>Bleſſing</hi> himſelf again
with the <hi>Sign of the Croſs,</hi> he repoſed his Head upon the <hi>Block,</hi> never
more to lift it up, in this <hi>Mortal State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Heads'-Man</hi> took the <hi>Ax</hi> in his hand, and after a ſhort pauſe;
Elevated it on high, as it were to take Aim, and ſet it down again.
A ſecond time he did ſo, and Sighed. The third time he gave the
<hi>Fatal Blow,</hi> which ſevered my <hi>Lord's Head</hi> from his <hi>Body,</hi> ſave only
a ſmall part of the <hi>Skin and Wind-pipe,</hi> which was immediatly cut off
with a <hi>Knife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Body</hi> after Seperation from the <hi>Head, Trembled</hi> a little, and <hi>Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
no more. The <hi>Head</hi> was received into a <hi>Black Silk Scarf,</hi> by two
of my <hi>Lord's Friends,</hi> and retained by them, till the <hi>Sheriff</hi> called for
it, and commanded the <hi>Executioner</hi> to hold it up to the view of the
<hi>Multitude;</hi> The which he did, at the four Corners of the <hi>Scaffold;</hi>
Crying aloud, <hi>This is the Head of a Traytor.</hi> But however the <hi>People</hi>
had been formerly poſſeſſed with <hi>prejudice</hi> both againſt my <hi>Lord's
Practices</hi> and <hi>Principles;</hi> Yet now, they made no <hi>Acclamations</hi> at the
ſight of the <hi>Bloud-dropping Head,</hi> nor ſeemed much taken with the
<hi>Jollity</hi> of the <hi>Spectacle;</hi> Some went away with <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Remorſe,</hi>
for their paſt hard <hi>cenſure</hi> of him; Others conceived ſtrange <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions</hi>
and <hi>fears</hi> of <hi>God's Judgments</hi> enſuing <hi>Perjury,</hi> and <hi>Bloudſhed.</hi>
Some again ſaid, <hi>My Lord was Drunk with Brandy;</hi> Others ſaid, <hi>Verily
This was a just Man.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 23. 48.</note> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> who beſt knew his <hi>Innocence;</hi> And

beheld this whole <hi>Tragedy</hi> with moſt tender <hi>Reſentments.</hi> They
regarded him as a <hi>Victime of Religion and Innocence.</hi> They mutually
accompanied him with their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> to <hi>God</hi> in his

with him, both in his <hi>Dolours</hi> and <hi>Joyes.</hi> They <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> and
<hi>Praiſed Almighty God</hi> for his goodneſs to Him, and to Them, in Him.
They <hi>Glorified</hi> his <hi>Holy Name,</hi> who often ſheweth the ſtrength of his
<hi>Power,</hi> in the weakeſt <hi>Subjects.</hi> In fine, many did, (and ſtill do)
believe, the peculiar grace, and preſence of <hi>God's Spirit,</hi> had ſome

               </p>
               <p>No ſooner was <hi>Execution</hi> done, but the <hi>Sun,</hi> (which before was
obſcured, and ſecluded from our ſight,) on a ſuddain diſſipating the
Clouds, ſent forth it's Clear and Illuſtrious Beams; Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
different Parties have ſince made different Reflections; My
<hi>Lord's</hi> Adverſaries ſay, <hi>The Sun before ſrowned at</hi> Popiſh <hi>Guilt, but ſeemed
pleaſed when Juſtice was done.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, <hi>The Heavens mourned

Bloud; <hi>but appeared in Joy, and Splendour, at the Reception of a
New and Glorious Inhabitant into their Coeleſtial Manſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Head</hi> had been publickly expoſed, it was returned back
into the <hi>Silk Scarf,</hi> held by a Youth that had waited upon my <hi>Lord,</hi>
and ſo laid into the <hi>Coffin</hi> together with the <hi>Body,</hi> veſted. (For out
of Modeſty my <hi>Lord</hi> deſired he might not be ſtripped naked on the

to have them dipt in my <hi>Lord's Bloud,</hi> wherein ſome were Gratified,
and others had their Handkerchiefs thrown with Deriſion over the
<hi>Scaffold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this the <hi>Coffin</hi> was taken down from off the <hi>Scaffold</hi> by ſeveral
Bearers, and by them carried to the bounds of the <hi>Tower,</hi> where a

it's Interment into the <hi>Tower;</hi> A place (ſay the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) as it hath been

In Relation to the Chief Witneſſes againſt my

            <head type="sub">Here annexed for the more Ample Satisfaction of the

            <p>HAving in ſome meaſure performed what I purpoſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
in the front of this <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> I might well have here
put a ſtop to my Pen, had not an extraordinary Accident,
raiſed new matter of Reflections upon the <hi>King's Evidence</hi>
in point of <hi>Credit,</hi> and ſeemed to call me to a ſhort Survey of it, in
the cloſe of my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Judgments</hi> of the <hi>Almighty</hi> are incomprehenſible; And St. <hi>Paul</hi>
had good reaſon to Cry out,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> as it were in an Extaſy, O <hi>The depth of
the riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God; How unſearchable
are his Judgments, and his ways paſt finding out;</hi> Who could ever have
imagined, That the three direct and main <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt my Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
at his <hi>Tryal,</hi> ſhould all convene together at another, of a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſtamp; And this in ſo fatal a conjuncture, as to confound, and
deſtroy by open <hi>Perjury</hi> each others <hi>Teſtimony?</hi> My <hi>Lord</hi> (as you have
ſeen) endeavoured to ſhew the <hi>Infamy</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes:</hi> The <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi>
in their <hi>Evidence:</hi> The <hi>Incoherence</hi> of parts: And <hi>Incredibility</hi>
of <hi>circumſtances,</hi> throughout the whole <hi>Charge.</hi> To make out which
he alledged many preſſing <hi>Arguments,</hi> and produced many <hi>Substantial
Witneſſes,</hi> both <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> in his behalf: Nothing ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
wanting, ſave only his <hi>Adverſaries themſelves, againſt themſelves,</hi>
to compleat his <hi>Evidence.</hi> And here it is the <hi>Divine Goodneſs</hi> (ſay the
<hi>Papists</hi>) who is the <hi>Defender of Innocence,</hi> and <hi>Fountain of Truth,</hi> hath
wonderfully manifeſted what manner of <hi>Men,</hi> my <hi>Lord's Accuſers</hi> were,
and what Credit ought to be given them; Even by the proper <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
of their own <hi>Mouths;</hi> Herein alſo fulfilling in ſome ſort, what my
<hi>Lord</hi> himſelf (Prophetically) foretold in his laſt <hi>Speech, (viz.) I have
a great confidence that it will pleaſe Almighty God; And that he will in a
ſhort time bring Truth to Light. Then all the World will ſee and know,
what Injury they</hi> (Oates, Dugdale, <hi>and</hi> Turbervil,) <hi>have done me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:48868:38"/>
To give a brief account of this affair, There are few who have not
heard of the late <hi>Tryal</hi> of <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Protestant
Joyner</hi> (a man very active in the Death of my <hi>Lord Stafford,</hi> and a
zealous defender of <hi>Dugdales Honesty.</hi>) He was <hi>Impeached, Arraigned,
Condemned,</hi> and <hi>Executed for High Treaſon;</hi> In Speaking <hi>Treaſonable
Words;</hi> And having by a deſigned <hi>combination</hi> with others, appeared
in <hi>Arms</hi> to <hi>Seize the Kings Perſon at</hi> Oxford. The <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt him
were, <hi>Smith, Dugdale, Turbervil, Haines,</hi> Mr. <hi>Maisters,</hi> and Sir <hi>William
Jennings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not my intent here, to <hi>Epitomize Colledges</hi> whole <hi>Tryal;</hi> Nor
to give my Cenſure or Verdict upon it; But only to inform the <hi>Reader</hi>
of ſome Paſſages which chiefly relate to the main <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt my
<hi>Lord Stafford;</hi> And which are now become the Subject of Surprize,
and Aſtoniſhment to all Conſidering Perſons.</p>
            <p>Pleaſe then to Note, That <hi>Stephen Dugdale,</hi> and <hi>Edward Turbervil,</hi>
(two of the Principal <hi>Witneſſes</hi> upon whoſe <hi>Teſtimony</hi> my <hi>Lord</hi> was
<hi>Found Guilty,</hi>) and <hi>John Smith,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Narrative Smith,</hi> (who
at my <hi>Lords Tryal</hi> ſeemed the only plauſible <hi>Deponent,</hi> as to the <hi>Plot in
General</hi>) gave reſpective <hi>Evidence</hi> againſt this <hi>Colledge</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as
followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> Swore Firſt.<note place="margin">Page 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> told him; That the
<hi>King was a Papiſt,</hi> That he was as deep in the <hi>Plot</hi> as any Papiſt of
them all (which the Papiſts themſelves alſo confeſs.) That he had an
hand in Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godferys death;</hi> That he was a <hi>Rogue;</hi> That
nothing was to be expected from him but <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
And that the <hi>Clergy of England</hi> were <hi>Papiſts in Maſquerade,</hi>
Secondly, That <hi>Colledge</hi> had framed ſeveral notorious <hi>Libels</hi> againſt
the <hi>King</hi> to render him contemptible. And raiſed <hi>Arms</hi> with intent
to <hi>ſeize His Sacred Perſon at</hi> Oxford, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turbervil</hi> Swore,<note place="margin">Page 29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> He heard <hi>Colledge</hi> ſay; Firſt. That there was
no good to be expected from the <hi>King.</hi> For that he and his Family
were <hi>Papists,</hi> and had ever been ſuch. Secondly, That His Party
would <hi>Seize the King,</hi> and ſecure Him, till he came to thoſe terms
they would have of him. Thirdly, That the <hi>Parliament</hi> which cut off
the late <hi>King</hi>'s Head, did nothing but what they had juſt cauſe
for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Smith</hi> Swore; Firſt. That <hi>Colledge</hi> told him,<note place="margin">Page 27.</note> There were Moneys
collected to buy Arms and Amuniton to bring the <hi>King to Submiſſion
to His People;</hi> Adding thereunto, That he wondered Old <hi>Rowley</hi>
(meaning the <hi>King</hi>) did not conſider how eaſily His <hi>Fathers Head
came to the Block,</hi> which he doubted not would be the end of <hi>Rowley</hi>
at laſt. Secondly, That <hi>Colledge</hi> had provided himſelf of a great
Sword, Piſtols, Blunderbuſs, with Back, Breaſt, and Head-Peice.
And that he heard him ſay, The <hi>City</hi> was provided, and ready with
<hi>Powder and Bullets:</hi> That he would be one who ſhould <hi>Seize the
King</hi> in caſe he ſecured any of the Members of <hi>Parliament.</hi> And that
if any man, nay even <hi>Rowley</hi> himſelf ſhould attempt to ſeize upon his
Arms, <hi>He would be the death of him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>In direct Oppoſition to theſe witneſſes, <hi>Colledge</hi> produced <hi>Titus
Oates</hi> (the third principal Witneſs againſt my <hi>Lord Stafford.</hi> And firſt
Grand diſcoverer of the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi>) who gave atteſtation againſt the

upon occaſion with <hi>Dugdale</hi> concerning his being an intended
Evidence againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and other. <hi>Dugdale</hi> replied, There
is no body hath any cauſe to make any ſuch report of me; For <hi>I call
God to Witneſs</hi> I know nothing againſt any Proteſtant in <hi>England.</hi> But
afterwards <hi>Dugdale</hi> having Sworn matters of High-Treaſon againſt
<hi>Colledge,</hi> before the Grand-Jury at the <hi>Old-Baily;</hi> and being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
charged by <hi>Oates,</hi> as having gone againſt his Conſcience and
contrary to what he had declared to him. <hi>Dugdale</hi> anſwered. <hi>It was

               </p>
               <p>Againſt the ſame <hi>Dugdale, Oates</hi> farther depoſed. That <hi>Dugdale</hi>
did confeſs he had an old <hi>Clap;</hi> yet gave out he was Poyſoned;<note n="*" place="margin">viz. <hi>By the</hi> Papiſts.</note>
which ſham paſſed throughout the Kingdom in our Intelligences; But
in Truth (ſaid <hi>Oates</hi>) it was the <hi>Pox:</hi> As I will make appear by

would ſtand Guilty of all that is imputed to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGainſt <hi>Turbervil</hi> alſo <hi>Oates</hi> gave Evidence in theſe words.<note place="margin">Page 48.</note> A little
before the Witneſſes were Sworn againſt <hi>Colledge</hi> at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi>
I (<hi>Oates</hi>) met with Mr. <hi>Turbervil.</hi> I was in a Coach; But ſeeing
Mr. <hi>Turbervil;</hi> I ſtept out of the Coach, and ſpoke with him; For
hearing that he was a Witneſs, I did ask him, whether he was a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or no againſt <hi>Colledge?</hi> Mr. <hi>Turbervil</hi> ſaid, He would break any
ones head, that ſhould ſay ſo againſt him; for he <hi>neither was a Witneſs;
nor could give any Evidence againſt him.</hi> So after he came from <hi>Oxon,</hi>
I met with Mr. <hi>Turbervil</hi> again; And hearing he had been there;
I asked him, if he had Sworn any thing againſt <hi>Colledge?</hi> He ſaid, yes;
He had been ſworn before the Grand-Jury. Said I; Did not you
tell me ſo and ſo? Why (ſaid he) <hi>The Proteſtant Citizens have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
us; And God Damm him, He would not ſtarve.</hi> Theſe very
words he ſeveral times repeated; But when I asked him, what he
had ſworn? he ſaid; I am not bound to ſatisfie Peoples Curioſities.
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the word of a Prieſt</hi> (ſaid <hi>Oates) what I ſay is true; As I am a
Miniſter, I ſpeak it ſincerely; In the preſence of God; This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
did ſay theſe words to me;</hi> which made me affraid of the Man;
And I went my ways, and never ſpoke with him afterwards, nor durſt
I; For I thought, <hi>He that would Swear and curſe, after that rate, was
not fit to be talked with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In oppoſition to all which, <hi>Turbervil</hi> ſwore, That he met Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
juſt at his Lodgings; And the Dr. alighted out of his Coach, and
ſpoke to him, and invited him to come to his old Friends. For he
told him; <hi>They had ſome Jealouſie that he was not true to them;</hi> And he
farther told him; If he would come to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Head Clubb,</hi> he
ſhould be received with a great deal of Kindneſs. But never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
(ſaid <hi>Turbervil</hi>) did I ſpeak with the Doctor a Tittle about
any Evidence; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon my Oath (added he) I did not; And truly I

AGainſt <hi>Smith, Oates</hi> gave this atteſtation;<note place="margin">Page 49.</note> (<hi>viz.</hi>) To my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had ſome provoking words paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
betwixt them at <hi>Richards Coffee-houſe.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> comes out,
and Swears, <hi>God Damm him he would have</hi> Colledges <hi>Bloud;</hi> So when I
met him, ſaid I, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> you profeſs your ſelf to be a <hi>Priest,</hi> and
have ſtood at the <hi>Altar:</hi> And now you intend to take upon you, the
<hi>Miniſtery of the Church of England;</hi> And theſe words do not become
a <hi>Minister of the Goſpel,</hi> His reply was; <hi>God Damn the Goſpel.
This is truth (ſaid Oates) I ſpeak it in the preſence of God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The whole ſubſtance of this atteſtation, <hi>Smith</hi> abſolutely forſwore,
ſaying; <hi>Not one word of this is true, upon my Oath.</hi> Then addreſſing
himſelf to <hi>Oates.</hi> 'Tis a wonderful thing (ſaid he) you ſhould ſay
this of me, <hi>But I will ſufficiently prove it against you; That you have
confounded the Goſpel, And denied the Divinity too.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THis is the Sum of the Evidence given as well by Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> againſt
<hi>Dugdale, Turbervil and Smith;</hi> as by <hi>Dugdale, Turbervil and Smith</hi>
againſt Dr: <hi>Oates.</hi> From which fatal manner of ſelf-condemning and
<hi>Perjuring each other;</hi> The Papiſts (with two good conſequence) draw
theſe deductions.</p>
            <p>Either <hi>Oates</hi> atteſting theſe things againſt the aforenamed Witneſſes,
<hi>In the word of a Prieſt; As he was a Minister of the Goſpel, Sincerly;
In the preſence of God and Man,</hi> &amp;c. Did give true Evidence, or not;
If he did; Then are <hi>Dugdale; Turbervil, and Smith,</hi> both in their
Teſtimony againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> and in their ſeveral Oaths here againſt
<hi>Oates,</hi> doubly forſworn. But if <hi>Oates</hi> did not give here <hi>true</hi> Evidence
(as the other three poſitively Swear he did not) then is he guilty of
manifeſt <hi>Perjury.</hi> So that from the reciprocal Teſtimony of each other,
in this matter; It is an undenyable demonſtration; Either <hi>Oates</hi> (the
Pillar of the <hi>Plot,</hi>) or <hi>Dugdale, Turbervil, and Smith,</hi> (the joynt
Supporters of it,) or Both, and All, are Perjur'd Men, and can juſtly
Challenge no right of beleif,<note place="margin">Page 50.</note> or credit to any thing, they ever did,
or ſhall ſwear. Hence the <hi>Attorney General</hi> in this very Tryal inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly
complained: <q>
                  <hi>It is an unhappy thing That Dr.</hi> Oates <hi>ſhould come
in against theſe Men that ſupported his Evidence before.</hi> And Mr. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
<hi>Jefferies</hi> rightly inculcated to the Jury;<note place="margin">Page 94. &amp; 97.</note> 
                  <hi>If Dugdale Smith and
Turbervil, be not to be believed, you Perjure (ſaid he) three Men, And
(in them) trip up the Heels of all the Evidence and Diſcovery of the
Plot.</hi>
               </q> In like manner: The Papiſts argue: If <hi>Oates</hi> alſo, be
not to be believed; the whole Fabrick of the <hi>Plot</hi> Falls. What? Dr.
<hi>Oates?</hi> the <hi>Quondam Top-Evidence, The prime Diſcoverer; The Saviour
of the King, and Nation from Popiſh Maſſacre;</hi> He ſwear falſe? He
not to be believed? What Account ſhall be given to <hi>God, and the
World,</hi> for the <hi>Bloud-ſhed,</hi> and the Severities uſed, upon his Sole, or
chief Evidence? Yet it is impoſſible, if <hi>Dugdale, Smith, and Turbervil,</hi>
Swear not falſe, <hi>Oates</hi> ſhould Swear true; Or if he Swear not falſe;
They ſhould Swear true; And as it is impoſſible, both ſhould Swear
true; So is it next to impoſſible, (if either Swear falſe) the <hi>Plot</hi> ſhould
be true. However, moſt aſſuredly one part of the Witneſſes againſt
my <hi>Lord Stafford</hi> (without which the other could never have found
credit,) are here, by their very <hi>Compartners,</hi> proved <hi>Perjur'd Men.</hi>

IT is objected. They might all of them peradventure have ſworn
true before; Though ſome of them for certain Swear falſe now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Papiſts <hi>anſwer:</hi> So might they all of them for certain have
ſworn falſe before, though ſome of them peradventure ſwear true now.
We are not to Judge of Men's paſt, or future proceedings in order to
<hi>Justice,</hi> by what they poſſibly might be, but by what they probably
were, or, will be; And to make a rational Judgment herein, we have
no other Rule to guide us in the knowledge of covert <hi>intentions,</hi> then
the Teſt of <hi>Overt</hi> actions. Seing therefore theſe Witneſſes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
actually Perjur'd; We have no rational ground to believe, but
that upon the ſame motives, and in the ſame concurence of
Circumſtances, they both did, and will commit the ſame Crimes.</p>
            <p>Men of loſt Conſciences, and deſperate Fortunes, allured by gain,
and encouraged by Indempnities, regard not what,<note place="margin">Page 45.</note> when, nor how they
Swear. And my <hi>Lord Stafford</hi> had juſt Cauſe to ſay, <q>If it be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
theſe Men daily to frame new accuſations: If eaſy Credit be given
to all their <hi>Fables:</hi> And whatever they ſhall from time to time <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,</hi>
may paſs for good <hi>Evidence:</hi> Who can be ſecure? At this rate
they may by degrees, <hi>Impeach the whole Nation,</hi> (both <hi>Catholicks</hi> and
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi>) for Crimes which neither they nor any Man elſe, ever
yet dream't on.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo objected by <hi>Colledge's</hi> Party; That <hi>Dugdale, Smith,</hi> and
<hi>Turbervil,</hi> are <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>Maſquerade;</hi> and now made uſe on to Sham
off the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> by turning it upon the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi>
Wherefore
though credit may be given them when they Swear againſt <hi>Papists,</hi>
yet the ſame credit ought to be denyed, when they bear <hi>Teſtimony</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his <hi>Majeſties true Proteſtant Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Papiſts anſwer: Firſt,</hi> Granted, that <hi>Dugdale, Smith,</hi> and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervil</hi>
be real <hi>Papiſts;</hi> how is it proved they were imployed to Sham
off the <hi>Plot?</hi> Why may not <hi>Papists,</hi> be good <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt the
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in point of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> without Suſpition of a <hi>Sham?</hi> Is
<hi>Treaſon</hi> a thing ſo ſtrange, and unheard of amongſt the <hi>Presbyterians?</hi>
Or why ſhould credit be given to the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> when they Swear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> (who are only charged with a <hi>Deſign to Kill the
King,</hi>) And Credit be denyed to the ſame <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> when they Swear
againſt thoſe <hi>who actually Killed the King? Secondly,</hi> What the leaſt
Argument, or Appearence, is there, that <hi>Dugdale, Smith,</hi> and <hi>Turbervil</hi>
are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>Popiſhly affected?</hi> They profeſs the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi>
They frequent the <hi>Protestant Church,</hi> They receive the <hi>Proteſtant
Communion,</hi> They take all <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Tests</hi> can be required of them,
(as was acknowledged in this very <hi>Tryal.</hi>) They practiſe neither <hi>Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Pennance,</hi> nor other works of <hi>Supererrogation,</hi> (the <hi>Symptomes</hi> of
<hi>Popery.</hi>)<note place="margin">Page 88.</note> They purſue their former <hi>Deſign of Swearing againſt the</hi>
Papiſts, with as much obſtinacy, and violence as ever; (as was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
proved in this <hi>Tryal.</hi>) And is it poſſible the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
in their <hi>Shams</hi> and <hi>Intrigues,</hi> (if they had any) the very <hi>Perſons</hi>
who at the ſame time make it their <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Lively-hood,</hi> to <hi>cut their
Throats?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 90.</note> Indeed if any of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt my <hi>Lord Stafford</hi> be
<hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected, It is Dr. <hi>Oates, Whoſe preſent Diſparagement of his
fellow</hi> Evidence, <hi>look's</hi> (ſaid Mr. Sollicitor General,) <hi>as if he were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
returning to St.</hi> Omers.</p>

               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48868:40"/>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It is argued; The <hi>Jury,</hi> bringing in <hi>Colledge Guilty of High
Treaſon,</hi> by that very Verdict, cleared <hi>Dugdale, Smith,</hi> and <hi>Turbervil</hi>
of the <hi>Perjury,</hi> charged upon them by Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is anſwered: Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Jury</hi> brought in their Verdict againſt <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
not upon the ſole <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Dugdale, Smith,</hi> and <hi>Turbervil;</hi>
but more eſpecially, upon the <hi>Evidence</hi> given by Sir <hi>William Jennings,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Maiſters,</hi> Perſons of known worth and honeſty; As alſo upon
pregnant proof made, (and acknowledged in a manner by <hi>Colledge</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;)
That he by Combination with others, appeared in open <hi>Arms,</hi>
at an appointed time, and place, ready for, and Deſigning, <hi>publique
Acts of Hoſtility,</hi> in the very preſence of the <hi>King,</hi> yet without his
<hi>Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Authority;</hi> which by the <hi>Law</hi> is adjudged <hi>Treaſon. 2ly.</hi>
The <hi>Papiſts</hi> do not undertake to make good <hi>Oates</hi>'s Charge of <hi>Perjury</hi>
againſt <hi>Dugdale, Smith,</hi> and <hi>Turbervil;</hi> Nor theirs, againſt him: But
only to ſhew, that the guilt of this <hi>Horrid Crime</hi> lyeth amongſt them;
And conſequently, whether it be charged upon <hi>Oates,</hi> as the Chief
<hi>Swearing-Maſter,</hi> and Original Author of the <hi>Plot;</hi> Or upon <hi>Dugdale,
Smith,</hi> and <hi>Turbervil,</hi> at his <hi>Pedants</hi> and <hi>Acceſſaries</hi> in the <hi>Impoſture;</hi> Or
(as is moſt rational) upon Both, and All of them; It follow's, That the
<hi>Lord Stafford dyed by Perjury;</hi> And <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſuffered by their Villanies, the loſs of their <hi>Fortunes;</hi> their <hi>Eſtates,</hi>
their <hi>Liberties,</hi> their <hi>Lives.</hi>
