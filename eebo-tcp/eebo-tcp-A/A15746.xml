            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Why, the Sonne learnt it of his Father, you will say; or, 'twas a good and a godly Lesson, and no marvell then, if the wise Kings, both of them, put it in among their holy Advices.</p>
            <p>Yea, but <hi>Be not thou envious for the evill doer,</hi> sayes K. Solomon againe, at the first
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21393:3"/>
verse of this Chapter. What, againe? And so soon, so few verses between? Surely then there is some extraordinary matter in it, 'tis not onely one of his good Counsels, but 'tis some speciall one of them, one that he would have heeded and learned, afore many, above any other.</p>
            <p>It should seem so indeed; for, NOLI AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVLARI, <hi>Fret not thy selfe because of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, neither be thou envious for the evill doer,</hi> sayes he once more, in the verses next before my Text. For feare it should not make so deep an Impression in mens mindes as was fitting, he sets it on the <hi>third</hi> time, as loath to leave it, till it be throughly setled and fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their hearts; but <hi>tertiâ jam vice,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 13.1.</note> sayes the Apostle, <hi>firmum erit omne verbum,</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition <hi>thrise</hi> repeated will make it sure and immooveable.</p>
            <p>Now who (in the name of God) is that <hi>evill doer,</hi> of whom he here warnes us so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? or what is it the Wiseman would have us to doe, to shew that we are not <hi>envious</hi> for him? Why, that the Spirit hath set downe too, and that once and againe. In the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chapter, vers. 17. it is, <hi>Let not thy heart be envious for the evill doer, but let it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be in the Feare of the Lord.</hi> TIMOR DOMINI, that's the Generall Rule for it;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21393:3"/>
but least that might proove not Punctuall enough, he sayes it over againe, more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly here at my Text, <hi>Be not envious for the evill doer, but feare God, my sonne, and the King,</hi> and then that's enough;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Timor Dei, &amp; Regis,</hi> when he had said that, there needed (by like) no more Instruction: The distinct performance of these two, and the district avoidance of such as performe them not, of presumptuous and rechlesse Sinners, and of contemptuous and awelesse Subjects, a <hi>Noli aemulari</hi> for both these, not to sort or suit our selves with them, neither with them that <hi>feare</hi> not <hi>God,</hi> nor with them that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (forsooth) to <hi>feare God,</hi> but yet <hi>feare</hi> not the <hi>King,</hi> 'tis the very last, and chiefest Lesson this of all, that which Solomon (it seems) in his wisdome chose to close up his owne Book of Proverbs with.</p>
            <p>For how'ere he spake indeed <note n="*" place="margin">1. King. 4.32.</note> 3000 Proverbs in all, and this of my Text now makes not above 700, yet as it appeares both by the verse after my Text [<hi>Also these things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the wise</hi>] and by the first verse of the Chapter following [<hi>These are also Proverbs of Solomon, which Hezekiah's men copied out</hi>] it is more then probable, that this Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs went no further once then this, to <hi>Feare God and the King,</hi> and then he had done; And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21393:4"/>
that all which now followes, from my Text to the end of this Book, were but fragments col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of his other workes, gatherings and gleanings which afterward other men got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and when they had them, added them to this Book; but with this he himselfe ended it at the first, as the very Summe and Crowne and Vpshot of all, TIME DEVM, FILI MI, ET REGEM, <hi>Feare God, my sonne, and the King.</hi>

of the Gospel pared off at once: But then <hi>Naturall</hi> things, and such as comply with <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity</hi> and <hi>freedome,</hi> (as the Knowing of God, the Loving of him, the Following his Word, and the Subduing our owne lusts) these were to be <hi>dilated</hi> by the Gospel, and not <hi>dissolved</hi>; so far from <hi>abolition,</hi> that they received a far greater <hi>augmentation.</hi> And from hence it comes (saith he) that our <hi>Feare of God</hi> (that's it which principally he chooses to insist upon) is much more <hi>growne</hi> now, then ever the Law could expect it. And why? Because it is <hi>naturall</hi> (sayes he) that <hi>Sonnes</hi> should <hi>feare</hi> more then <hi>Servants,</hi> the very <hi>Libertie</hi> of <hi>Sonnes</hi> being as a Loadstone to allure, and as a Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone to increase, and as a Touchstone to trie their Love, and their inbred Affection, setting such an edge on the <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Feare</hi> which they beare him, as no <hi>Slavery</hi> of the Law could ever skill of.</p>

            <p>Now the Psalmist indeed does not there set it downe; but if any professe they are come
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21393:7"/>
to learne it, I dare close up this point with an answer to that other question of his, <hi>Quis est vir?</hi> Psal. 25. <hi>What Man is he that feareth the Lord?</hi> For a man may soon know him now; at least, he may easily know, whether himselfe be the man: If he finde in his soule so pure and devoted an Affection to God his Father, that his Ioy is onely how to please him, and his Studie to avoide offending of him, his whole Content is that God loves him, and securely he rests himselfe upon the favour that God ha's to him; <hi>Hic vir, hic est,</hi> this man may be bold that he is a good Proficient, and that he hath throughly learnt the <hi>feare</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet this is not enough though for the <hi>Time Deum</hi> here in my Text. That there is such a thing as <hi>Feare,</hi> and that it is now in a more liberall and Sonne-like condition, then when Solomon spake of it, and that the minde of man may be and ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely affected with it, and that God alone must be the Object of it; in Speculation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it comes to no more, <hi>Timor Domini</hi> is but this, and these particulars make up the full <hi>Theorie</hi> of the <hi>feare</hi> of the <hi>Lord:</hi> But yet there goes somewhat more to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect dutie of it; for this <hi>Time Deum,</hi> as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and particular Precept, aymes also at the <hi>Practising</hi> of it, it implies the <hi>fact</hi> as well as

            <p>For <hi>Corpus autem aptâsti mihi,</hi> if ever ye markt it, you know 'tis not omitted of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himselfe, that God having ordained him a Body, in that Body he was to performe his will; Heb. 10.9. And much more is it so with us; we being Bodies also and not onely Spirits, the Spirit alone will not suffice us; 'tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that our mindes and affections are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> endued with it, but such <hi>expressions</hi> withall we must make, as that the performance of the Dutie may be <hi>witnessed.</hi> The Dutie we acknowledge is, that we doe <hi>Feare God</hi>; and but by that which is to be read in our <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deportment,</hi> neither God nor Man will beare us <hi>witnesse,</hi> that we do <hi>Feare</hi> him.</p>
            <p>God, nor Man, I say. For <hi>expressions</hi> I shall shew you there are of both kinds, both to God and to Man. To Man, that he may know it, and so (when need is) acknowledge it, and glorifie God for it, or profit himselfe by it: To
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21393:8"/>
God, onely that he may be pleased to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, though he knew it long before; for he knowes what is in man, better then man himselfe. And for this 'tis brought in with a <hi>Nunc</hi> to Abraham (that Father, not of the <hi>Faithfull</hi> alone, but of the <hi>Fearefull</hi> too; for He is the first that's ever said to <hi>Feare</hi> the Lord) Gen. 22.12. <hi>Nunc cognovi, quòd time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> Now I know that thou <hi>fearest</hi> God What?

Peter answered Christs third que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Whether he loved him,</hi> with <hi>Lord thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee,</hi> and yet Christ the third time said to him, <hi>Feed my sheep,</hi> Ioh. 21.17. As who should say, Ne're be sorie Simon, that I aske thee so often, and ne're doubt but I perfectly know thee; but know it I will not, till thou thus <hi>expresse</hi> it; for how'ere God requires truth in the <hi>inward</hi> parts, yet the inward parts alone are not all he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, he will not know, that he is loved, unlesse that love doe <hi>outwardly</hi> appeare, and <hi>expression</hi> we must make of our <hi>Feare,</hi> or els he will not acknowledge, that we doe <hi>feare</hi> him.</p>

that

upon speciall commands there may be Speciall wayes of it, even to the sacrificing of an onely Sonne, if God so require. But the Ordinarie way that lyes open for all men, the very word it selfe here will shew us, that we must <hi>expresse</hi> our <hi>feare</hi> to God by <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>; for so the word <hi>feare</hi> ordinarily imports in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>When Moses had at large described the whole Dutie of Gods <hi>Worship,</hi> his conclusion is, <hi>And now Israel, what doth the Lord require of thee, but to feare him?</hi> Deut. 10.12. That spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall command, which God sent against wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of strange Gods, was, <hi>Feare not the Gods of the land where you dwell</hi>; Iudg. 6.10. And the complaint which the Prophet makes of Israel, that <hi>the feare wherewith they feared God, was in precepts of mens teaching,</hi> Esa. 29.13. by Christ himselfe 'tis expounded of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting Gods Worship; <hi>In vaine doe they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship me, teaching for Doctrines the precepts of men</hi>; Matth. 15.9.</p>
            <p>And in this sense I can tell what to make of it, that when the Articles were to be sworn to, betwixt the two great Princes Laban and Iacob, how Iacob should use Labans daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whome he had to wife, and how Laban should keep a faithfull league with Iacob; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban indeed sware by his Idols, but Iacob sware
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21393:9"/>
a strange oath, <hi>Per timorem Patris Isaac,</hi> by the <hi>feare</hi> of his Father Isaac; Gen. 31.53. What was that? Why, Laban sware according to his Religion, and Iacob according to his; by the worth and truth thereof, and by that Deitie which his Father and he <hi>feared,</hi> to wit, the God of Heaven, whom they <hi>worshipped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with a reference to this also we must take it, what's recorded in holy writ of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obadiah, holy Iob, devout Cornelius, and sundry others, still, how they <hi>feared God:</hi> For as it appeares by the Wiseman,<note place="margin">

But to make it sure, he goes on in the next words there, <hi>And in thy feare will I worship in thy holy Temple,</hi> saith he; There we have them both expresly; not <hi>worship</hi> put alone, nor <hi>feare</hi> alone put for <hi>worship</hi> (though either had been enough, I will <hi>worship</hi> thee, or, I will shew my <hi>feare</hi> of thee, in thy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) but both together; When I am there, <hi>in thy feare will I worship,</hi> that is, I will adore thee with such <hi>Expressions</hi> of Humilitie and Reverence, as of right doe appertaine to a Creator from his Creature.</p>
            <p>And how fully then meets this with the Epidemiall prophanation of our times, that will thrid you a difference now betwixt this <hi>feare</hi> and perfect <hi>worship,</hi> betwixt a Religion and a due Devotion, betwixt Holines and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines?

That's true, we have a great deale of Religion in our Eares too. But yet higher or lower though we have none, None upon our Heads, for a due Reverence before him; None in our Knees, to bow at his blessed Name; None for our Bodies, to cast them downe and <hi>worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Especially not in his house, in the most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred presence of our God; No, the lesse a doe there, the better, the lesse Superstition.

            </p>
            <p>But to these unsavorie Fancies, may the Prophet Malachy have leave to reply; many passages of whose first Chapter (<hi>mutatis mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandis</hi>) fit these times as well, as they did those they were made for. And they are ne're a whit from my Text neither; for they are all about Expressions of <hi>Feare</hi> in the Service of God. At the sixt verse, <hi>If I be a Father, where is my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? and if I be a Master, where is my Feare, saith God to you that despise my Name?</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:21393:10"/>But they wondred he should complaine: They <hi>feared</hi> him, and <hi>honoured</hi> him, they were sure, as they should doe; (and it may well be, they meant it as we doe, <hi>within,</hi> in our hearts forsooth;) therefore they reply againe; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise? <hi>Wherein have we despised thee?</hi> vers. 7. God tels them, <hi>In that ye say, The Table of the Lord is not to be regarded:</hi> There's one particular for them, of the want of <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>honour.</hi> And are there not of us that say the same? The Table of the Lord, and the House of the Lord, and the Presence of the Lord, would you know how we (some of us) regard it, or what difference we put betwixt it and any other places? A great deale lesse, I am sure, then some other: For the Kings Presence, and the places where but our betters are, have a great deale more Reverence and Worship from us; and we our selves expect a great deale more in the presence of our Inferiours.</p>
            <p>And yet that's Gods expresse argument against us there, (but that we now adayes are able to teach God better Logick) <hi>Goe and do so to thy Prince now, and see if he will be content with thee,</hi> saith God, ver. 8. <hi>Worship</hi> not when thou comest in to Him, beg any thing of Him not on thy knee, bow not downe in honour of Him; but be Iack-fellow, sit still, or be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when He hath ought to doe with thee, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21393:11"/>
will He accept thee? And yet, <hi>I am the greatest King of all,</hi> saith the Lord of Hosts, there in that Chapter.</p>
            <p>But at this we snuffe, and cry, <hi>Ecce Labor!</hi> oh, here's a doe indeed for Vncovering, and Standing, and Kneeling, and Bowing; but what reason is there, we should be put to so much inconvenience and wearinesse in <hi>serving God,</hi> who as himselfe is a Spirit, so he requires but to be <hi>worshipt</hi> in Spirit and truth, and he knowes our hearts well enough? And was not that the very exception then of the Iewes also? <hi>But ye have said, It is a wearinesse</hi>; ECCE LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOR! <hi>and ye have snuffed at it, saith the Lord of Hosts,</hi> ver. 13. And then what's the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? <hi>Therefore my name is, and shall be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full among the Heathen,</hi> saith he, at the 14 verse God upbraids and threatens them with the Heathen their neighbours, whose Idolatrous Religion exprest more <hi>feare</hi> of a God though, then theirs. And upbraided as well may we be, and threatned too, with the Erroneous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions that neighbour about us; for they are far more carefull to shew the holy Signes of <hi>feare,</hi> then we: And by that (to say right) they now stand; the opinion, and affection, and devotion of the people (I speake by some experience) in liking of them, and loathing of ours, being by no one thing so much car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21393:11"/>
with them, as 'tis by the <hi>outward</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Reverence.</p>
            <p>I should then but wrong our Nation of old, when they first became English, should I not make this a note of the excellent Spirit which then possessed them, that as they lost (almost) all words of their owne language to signifie this passion of the minde which we meane by <hi>Feare,</hi> so they borrowed none from other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, but onely this word <hi>Feare</hi>; and that they brought from the Latine <hi>Vereri</hi>; to shew, that at first their noble Affections knew no <hi>feare,</hi> but the <hi>feare of God,</hi> Filiall and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentiall <hi>feare</hi> alone, such as God himselfe (we see) would have his <hi>Worship</hi> performed by, and our <hi>Religion</hi> exprest by.</p>
            <p>And if once we come to loose that in our Religion, our <hi>feare,</hi> we shall soon come to loose Religion and all, howe're we soothe our selves: For that's the way to hold even the right Religion also, S.

               </note>ANd thus make we the Expression of our <hi>feare</hi> of God, to God himselfe. But yet other Expressions there are of the same to Man. In Generall first; The Commerce that passes betweene us and others, the Iustice and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, the Mercy and Charitie, the Truth and Honestie, which we shew towards all men, these are as Broad Seales to proove it to them, and the Letters Patents that testifie it, and justifie us in our <hi>feare</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>That unrighteous Iudge, that <hi>feared</hi> not God, but righted the poor widow onely to avoid trouble, yet he in denying to doe it for any <hi>feare</hi> of God or Man, even by that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21393:12"/>
that the chiefest thing, which should have mooved him to it, was the <hi>feare</hi> of God, Luk. 18.4. And whence was it, that Abraham could look for no better then murther and rape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Philistines, that they would kill him, and force his wife, but because he thought, <hi>Surely the feare of God was not in that place?</hi> Gen. 20.11. But Ioseph on the other side, ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to satisfie his Brethrens minde, and to make them not doubt of faire and honest dealing at his hand, makes that the Reason and Assurance of it, <hi>This doe, and live,</hi> saith he, <hi>for I also feare God,</hi> Gen. 42.18.</p>
            <p>And in this regard, it is worth the observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that when God was pleased to take the Devils owne verdict concerning Iobs <hi>fearing</hi> God, how e're Iob was excellent at both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, at the acts of Religion, in his holy and daily Worshipping of God; &amp; the acts of Honestie, in his upright Dealing with all men; yet God questions the Devil, not of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, his Religious <hi>fearing</hi> him, but onely of the other, his Righteous <hi>fearing</hi> of him; <hi>Hast thou not considered my Servant Iob, that there is none like him upon earth, in the fearing of God?</hi> Iob 1.8. But how was that to appeare to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? He sayes not, For he Prayes thus much, he Preaches thus often, he Sacrifices daily, he Professes continually, all which might well
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21393:13"/>
have been said of him; but, <hi>For he is an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and just man, and eschewes wrong and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi> sayes God: Signes able to convince the Devill himselfe, who not daring upon those Proofes to denie it, onely sought to blemish it with a slaunder of sinister respects; <hi>Timet, sed an gratis?</hi> 'tis true, Iob <hi>feares</hi> God, I see by that, but does he <hi>feare God for nought?</hi> at the 9. verse.</p>
            <p>The point is so cleare (say some talkers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us what they will) that I shall but wrong you to illustrate it. I shall better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it with this advertisement, That these two Expressions of our <hi>Feare,</hi> to God by our Holinesse, and to Man by our Righteousnesse, they must never be confounded, nor the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions misplaced. How e're by our Worship of God, men may well hope of our <hi>fearing</hi> of him, and by our Vprightnes with men, God takes notice, how well we doe <hi>feare</hi> him; yet we mistake it fowly, if we think we may spare one of them, and that either Expression may well enough serve Both.</p>
            <p>It was but vainly done therefore of the proud-holy Pharisee, to tell God, by his not being <hi>like the Publican,</hi> that he was <hi>no extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner nor unjust, nor adulterer</hi>; and by his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>fasting,</hi> that he was no Glutton; and by his faithfull <hi>tith-payings,</hi> that he was no

            <p>And e'ry whit as vain is the other Pharisaicall trick, that's now become the signe of a Saint among many of us, little to regard that, which our <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21393:14"/>
all this, to make full accompt, that our run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Church, and crying out for Sermons, our defying the Devill, and rayling against Antichrist, our pretending of Conscience and finding fault with the State and Times, our singing of Psalmes, and talking of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, our casting up of the Eye, and making of sowre Faces, must be proofe enough to any man, that we <hi>feare</hi> God extraordinarily.</p>
            <p>Alas, no; 'tis a Catholick rule, that which S.

               </note> for the <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi> of our <hi>Fearing</hi> of God, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act all the duties between Man and Man, then in stead of them all, (at least-wise by way of Collection for them all) take we but Gods way here, Expresse we the one by another that's next to it, the <hi>feare</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>feare</hi> of the <hi>King.</hi> The Text (you see) joynes them so close, that it makes but one and the same Act for two Objects, <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> two Persons, but conjoyned in one Act of our <hi>Feare,</hi> both made one in that, <hi>Feare God, my sonne, and the King</hi>; To make us know, that what holy pretenses so e're are made for it, yet <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>feared,</hi> if the <hi>King</hi> be not; the want of Performance in the one, implies Imperfection in the other, and the want of Truth in the one, avouches Hypocrisie in the other: No <hi>Kings feare,</hi> no <hi>Gods feare</hi>; God himselfe of purpose hath here joyned them together, and 'tis to make God a lyar, a mans selfe Sacrilegious, if any dare take either from other, or put them asunder.</p>
            <p>And the reason of it is impregnably good, or els the blessed Spirit in S. Iohn was but a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21393:15"/>
poore Logician. For did you ever marke it, how he enforces the absolute necessitie of brotherly love among us? He hath two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments together for it; 1. Ioh. 4. <hi>If any man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a lyar; For how can he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, love God whom he hath not seen</hi>? verse 20. That's the first, and it is a Topick rule that; particularly applied by him upon this ground, because of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Image of God, which is upon a mans brother; He sees not him, but he sees Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in him, and God he sees not, but in some Image of him; and the livelyest Image of God is in his brother; <hi>Et ergò,</hi> In very good reason then, <hi>How can he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, love God, whom he hath not seen?</hi> No, he cannot; the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on [<hi>How can he</hi>] is but to make the Negation more vehement; it is a thing impossible in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reason.</p>
            <p>The other Argument of S. Iohn is <hi>ab Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate,</hi> a sufficient Reason that in it selfe, that we are <hi>commanded</hi> it; but yet it is steel'd with the temper of another Topick rule also, because Where one thing is ordained to be with another, there the one is not as it should be without the other. <hi>Now this commandement have we of him,</hi> saith he. What? That we
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21393:15"/>
should love our brother? No, that's not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; But <hi>that he which loveth God should love his brother also</hi>; verse 21. That's the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>Carry then now but these two Arguments in minde, and conclude who will for my Text and the King, and the Spirit here will warrant him: But reply or deny who can, for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will confound him. As good as those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in S. Iohn for his purpose, for the <hi>love</hi> of our <hi>brother,</hi> I dare boldly say it, (and let me forfet my Arts and Iudgement too, if I make it not appeare to any honest mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) that they are far more pregnant here both for our purpose, for the <hi>feare</hi> of the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the first, and I apply it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly; If any man say, I <hi>feare God,</hi> and <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> not the <hi>King,</hi> he is a lyar (And Lord! what an holy armie of lyars might we then quickly muster up?) But what's the Reason? For, <hi>How can he?</hi> that is, It is impossible for him that <hi>feareth</hi> not the <hi>King</hi> whom he hath seen, to <hi>feare God,</hi> whom he hath not seen. And why so? How followes that? From the very same ground as before, Because of the Image of God which is upon Kings, and that, not onely a Generall Image, as they are Men; but a Peculiar Image, and that (by far) more visible, as they are Kings; yea the Image of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21393:16"/>
that in God, for which <hi>feare</hi> belongs to God, <hi>that</hi> Image upon the King, the lively Image of his Divine Power, and Glory both.</p>
            <p>Power first; Whether Power to doe good, and therefore <hi>Feare</hi> him, For <hi>with whom is Mercy, therefore shall he be feared,</hi> Psal. 130.4. Or Power to doe hurt, and therefore <hi>feare</hi> him, <hi>For he beareth not the sword in vaine,</hi> Rom. 13.4.</p>
            <p>And then Glorie; The Glorie of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Titles: For <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Governour, Lord</hi> and <hi>Father, Majestie</hi> and <hi>Soveraigntie,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Calvin himselfe confesses, that they are first and principally Gods Titles,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Institut. l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</note> and not Mans; and that they are so imparted from God to Kings, as his Deputies and Vicegerents; that where e're on earth we meet with them, they ought presently to affect us with an awefull sense of the very Divinitie it selfe. Yea, (for that very purpose) the Glorie of his owne Name upon them: <hi>Dixi, Dii estis,</hi> Psal. 82.6. <hi>I have said, ye are Gods</hi>; I have said it, God himselfe, 'tis He that said it; and <hi>Dixi,</hi> it is his Decree and Sacred Pleasure, he hath Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, it shall be so.</p>
            <p>And from this Ordinance of his, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have oft exprest it so. Iacob of old said it (and of one, that was otherwise bad enough) of his Lord Esau, That he saw <hi>God</hi> in him,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21393:16"/>
               <hi>Vidi faciem, ut faciem Dei,</hi> Gen. 33.10. that is, saies the Chaldee, <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Prince, God</hi> in him, as he was the <hi>Prince.</hi> And 'tis said of Moses so, The very Scepter he held, was <hi>Gods,</hi> not his owne, <hi>Virga Dei in manu,</hi> Exod. 17.9. and so it is said of Solomon, The Throne he sate on, was the Throne of GOD: <hi>Sedebat su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Throno Dei,</hi> 1. Chron. 29.23. And so the Argument prooves invincible; Kings bearing both so apparent and so eminent an Image of God, the very Image of that eminence in God, for which God is <hi>feared</hi>; How can he, that <hi>feareth</hi> not the <hi>King,</hi> whom visibly he hath seen, or may see, <hi>feare God,</hi> who never was, nor is (and I may safely adde) who, without this other the <hi>feare</hi> of the King, never shall, nor will be visible to him?</p>
            <p>You see the maine improovement of S. Iohns first Argument. And 'tis as easie to doe the same in the second. <hi>Now this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have we of him, that he which loveth God, should love his brother also.</hi> Is that a good and a concluding Consequence? And is not this as good then? This Commandement have we of Him, that he which <hi>feareth God</hi> should <hi>feare</hi> the <hi>King</hi> also. And for proofe of this, I come but to my Text, It is a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Him, from <hi>God</hi> himselfe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, though given here by Solomons pen,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21393:17"/>
               <hi>Feare GOD, my sonne, and the KING.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you require a New Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it, that is, a Commandement in the Gospel (as Christ indeed calls the precept of Loving one another a <hi>New Commandement,</hi> Ioh. 13.34.) then I goe but to the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle for it, <hi>Feare God, Honour the King,</hi> 1. Pet. 2.17. And then I adde, that by this very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument now, the Dutie of <hi>feare</hi> is far more clearly prooved here, then there in S. Iohn that Dutie of Love is; For this here is set down <hi>in terminis</hi> (you see) we have the places, this of my Text, and that of S. Peter; both of them formall Commands, and in plaine Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall termes, both equally concluding for the <hi>feare</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi>: And so have we not for the Love of God and our Brother; No place to be found, (I speake advisedly) in so Expresse, so Distinct, and so Mandatorie a Proposition, for those two together, in all the Scripture.</p>
            <p>But I fore-see already what the issue of this will be. It is but a spice of Court-flattery in us, or els all this labour might well be spared. For who denies, but the <hi>King</hi> must be <hi>feared?</hi> Will not Bellarmine, or Iunius Brutus graunt that? I know they will, and yet when they have done, I will kon them small thanks for it. For how do they doe it? <hi>Dolosus ambulat
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21393:17"/>
in generalibus,</hi> That's their craft, the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Iesuite in that Church, and the factious Schismatick in ours; in Generall termes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they stick not aloud to professe this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, talke of it in grosse, and who halfe so holy in Conscience as they, or so loyall in Dutie of <hi>fearing</hi> the <hi>King?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet bring it once downe to a present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and lay it (as occasion shall arise) to particular Cases and Actions, and then (you shall finde) the case is altered with them; Dutie and Conscience then (for sooth) against it, when they like not the businesse. As the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in my Text (of purpose surely) ha's most aptly described them, <hi>Feare God, and the King, and medle not with them that be Seditious</hi>; So we bluntly read it in many of our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; 'tis true that; but yet perhaps 'tis some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too course for their hypocriticall preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, They are godly men, and good Subjects, and defie Sedition:</p>
            <p>Therefore the Originall meets pat with them, <hi>Non cum Mutantibus,</hi> or <hi>Recedentibus,</hi> Medle not with those that are given to <hi>change,</hi> not with those that <hi>alter,</hi> or <hi>goe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>; And these are they now, that when it comes to that, from their generall Profession to some particular Performance, are notable <hi>changelings,</hi> they <hi>alter</hi> then, and falter too;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21393:18"/>
               <hi>backward</hi> they goe, and fall away slyly from their Profession, and from their Dutie; from the King, and from the due <hi>feare</hi> of him: Nay from the very Text it selfe indeed, they <hi>alter</hi> That in the end, and take it <hi>backward</hi>; not They <hi>feare</hi> the King then, but The King <hi>feare</hi> Them, if they may doe it; and so all at last becomes <hi>changed</hi> and <hi>altered</hi> with them, from No <hi>feare</hi> at first, to No <hi>King,</hi> e're they have done; and from None that does <hi>feare,</hi> to None to be <hi>feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when that is brought about once, I can tell them what will be next also. For stay there they will not neither, but still they will fall <hi>backe,</hi> as far as the Text ha's any roome; from no King, to no God, and from no <hi>feare</hi> of the one, to no <hi>feare</hi> of the other, to no <hi>feare</hi> at all of any. Moses he plainly tells them so, <hi>Non contra nos, sed contra Iehovam,</hi> when the Israelites murmured against him and Aaron, Exod. 16.8. <hi>Your murmurings are not against us but against the Lord.</hi> And the Lord himselfe said it as plainly to Samuel, <hi>Non Te, sed Me,</hi> when they would needs have another King in his stead, 1. Sam. 8.7. They <hi>have not cast Thee away, but they have cast Me away.</hi> And so <hi>Non Regem, sed Deum,</hi> must I say to these, that now by not <hi>fearing</hi> the King as they should doe, doe as much as they can to Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21393:18"/>
him againe, It is not the <hi>King,</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> whom they principally faile; For there is not the least contempt of Majestie, but is more then a spice of Prophanation; and e'ry step of Disloyaltie is a high degree to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme.</p>
            <p>And in how high a degree then this danger of Atheisme now a dayes rangeth, this Text of mine (in my eye) does clearely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. It shewed us before, that the <hi>Feare</hi> of the Lord requires the <hi>Worship</hi> of him, and that the due <hi>worship</hi> of him requires so much Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Reverence, that all our saucy and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse demeanour before him, all negligent and perfunctorie performance of our Religion, all slight and unawful Expressions in it, as in Gods presence, are the foulest Scorn and Abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that may be; Vngodding him no lesse in true construction, then does rash and unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised blasphemie.</p>
            <p>It shews us now, that next after himselfe, our God provides for Kings as for himselfe, Sets his eminent Image upon them, sets them in his owne stead, sets but one rule of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the <hi>feare</hi> of them both, both himselfe, and them: In a word, sets so much by them, whom he sets over us, that for us now not to be abundantly Right towards them, is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely Wrong towards God; to faile the one,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21393:19"/>
is to be false to the other; to defraude the one, is to defie the other.</p>
            <p>Take me now but a man of understanding among the very Heathen, (for still I drive at that, to convince it from the evidence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it selfe) and let him see First, That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e're these Duties of <hi>fearing</hi> God and King are charged upon us, not so much by any written Law, as by a Law within us also, by the Rule of Reason, and the Divine Law of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet many of the Great Professors of this Religion, they that take upon themselves above others, to be this Gods chiefest Sonnes and Servants, and to have the best Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by far; yet for all this, they stumble and make a doubt of performing such a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and seemly <hi>worship</hi> to their <hi>God</hi>; and as for their <hi>King,</hi> they not onely stand in great suspense, but dispute it also fiercely, whether (for all his Vicinity to God) he can of Right be invested with so Divine a Priviledge.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That in this fond uncertainty of theirs, they doe not look, <hi>In quam partem tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiùs peccetur,</hi> and in wisdome venture most up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is safest; but for Conscience sake (for sooth) ever incline to the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous part, &amp; out of a singular Devotion still cleave fast to the worst; choosing, rather then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21393:19"/>
afford their God or King an inch (perhaps) too much, to tedder them both stiffely at (sure) an ell too little:</p>
            <p>Lastly, That in this preposterous course, they have purposely so inured their thoughts, and hammerd their Consciences to it, as that now they count it a shrewd wrong to be but told what's right; &amp; if any man dare be so true to God and King, as to shew them the Dutie of better Devotion, they besmeare him present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a coale of dangerous Superstition; if of better Allegiance, they brand him soundly with the slaunder of ambitious Flattery; &amp; by all meanes they reckon them, that stand least upon points with <hi>God</hi> in <hi>worshipping</hi> of Him, the godliest men and the best Christians; but them, that stand most upon points with the <hi>King</hi> against obeying of Him, the best Subjects, or (as now it goes currant in their owne coyn) good Patriots.</p>
            <p>And now let this Pagan but say, what he thinks of a God that must thus be used, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Himselfe, or in his Vicegerents; and what difference he can finde in Reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween such a Religion, as they by this meanes make of it (and his owne, I will not say, for the very Heathen in their abominations carry themselves more Conscientiously; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween such a Religion) and a down right Fable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:21393:20"/>And if this be not a good Consequence, go blame S. Paul, that taught me this kinde of Argument, and that in a point of Religion too, but of much lesse importance; For the whole Church (saith he) when they come together but to speake in unknowne tongues, he may not abide it. And why? Because 'tis so disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from Reason, a Confusion so unnaturall, that if but a Heathen man come in, may he not well account it a mad Religion? <hi>Shall he not justly say, that they are all out of their wits?</hi> 1. Cor. 14.23.</p>
            <p>And how much more then, say I, if a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man come among our Religious ones, and finde such a hideous and uncouth Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy? Our Profession indeed to be, towards <hi>God,</hi> a Dutie of <hi>feare</hi> and holy <hi>Worship</hi>; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Kings,</hi> a Dutie of <hi>feare</hi> and sacred Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; towards <hi>both,</hi> a joynt Dutie, not from Policy, or Reason, or Nature alone (though e'ry one of these lawes enforce it mightily) but from Conscience also, and divine Law, and the very Principles of Religion: But yet our whole Practise notwithstanding to be, to <hi>God,</hi> heedlesse and unreverent, an arbitrary and fancifull, a rude and saucy slubbering of his <hi>worship</hi>; To <hi>Kings,</hi> a contemptuous and faithlesse, a quarrelsome and gracelesse, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining and heartlesse curtalling of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21393:20"/>
due to them: And may he not well take it for a mad fabulous Religion? shall he not justly say, <hi>Non est Deus,</hi> A God upon these crosse and beggerly termes cannot be a God?</p>
            <p>Wherefore my hearts desire, and humble prayer to God is, that he would open our eyes (as we are, or should be Christians of ripe understanding) to see this; and that we, who are ready enough, out of the former part of the Text, touching the <hi>feare</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to charge our neighbours about us, with the daunger of Idolatrie, in their manner of Divine <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> would make some Conscience to quit our selves as readily, in this part of the Text, touching the <hi>feare</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> from no lesse a crime, then Idolatry is, in our manner of wilfull Refusings. For the Spirit of God (we see) is expresse about it, 1. Sam. 15.23. That, as to <hi>Obey is better then Sacrifice,</hi> a better signe of our Religion, and to God far more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; so, to be Disobedient and Vnquiet, <hi>Nolle acquiescere,</hi> says the Text there, to be whyning and excepting, kicking and wincing at the sacred Commands of Authoritie over us (what e're we deem of it, or how e're we please our selves in it, and, like those grand Mistakers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.2.</note> thinke we doe God <hi>good service</hi> by it) yet 'tis as bad in Gods owne construction, as Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie and Idolatry too: And nothing more
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21393:21"/>
then this Sorcerie and Idolatrie (I feare me) it is, that of late hath so much troubled our Israel, and made the days of many so short in the Land which the Lord our God hath given us.</p>

               </note>SVre I am, it is a perfect and unhalting Obedience to the Powers above us, that must cause our days to be good and long in the Land; or els God himselfe misplaced it, when he made that, as <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.2.</note> S.

            <p>And, as sure I am, 'tis such an Obedience, that particularly the Spirit here ayms at, or els he would ne're have spoken unto us, in the dearest language of Love, as unto Sonnes, <hi>Feare God, my Sonne, and the King.</hi> For that's as much as to say, Vnlesse indeed you care not to be my <hi>Sonnes,</hi> unlesse you will be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards, and not <hi>Sonnes,</hi> Slaves and Rebels, and any thing but <hi>Sonnes,</hi> you will <hi>feare</hi> God and the King alike; not God alone, but therefore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21393:21"/>
the King also; God for himselfe, and the King for God; esteeming God and King (both) as your Fathers, and accounting your selves as <hi>Sonnes</hi> to both: not as Servants, onely of Necessitie, nor as Friends alone, of meer Courtesie; but as <hi>Sonnes,</hi> of entire Dutie.</p>
            <p>Yea, as One <hi>Sonne</hi> All, together; <hi>My Sonne,</hi> says God here to All; One and All, for none is excused; All as One, for none is excluded; To shew us, that it must be a joynt and mutuall Consent, of All in One; One, in the Bent of our heart and affections, Therefore <hi>Fili mi,</hi> says he, and not <hi>Filii mei, my Sonne,</hi> as of One, not my Sonnes, as of Many.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21393:22"/>
couched here in this short Text, <hi>Feare God, my Sonne, and the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this sacred Conjunction of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I may best conclude; In the name of God exhorting e'ry one of us that rejoyce in this Title of being <hi>Gods Sonne,</hi> to remember, First, that <hi>Time Deum</hi> stands here before <hi>Fili mi,</hi> the Dutie is enforced, before the Priviledge will be allowed: We are apt to forget our selves, (God knowes) and because of <hi>Filius,</hi> in pride of our Priviledge, we oft neglect <hi>Time,</hi> and make small or no regard of our Dutie. But <hi>Time Fili,</hi> that's Gods methode and order here, it is that Relation to him, which makes him retaine the name of <hi>Father</hi> to us, and without a due <hi>feare</hi> of him (flatter our selves how we will upon our Election or Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) we have no true <hi>Sonne-ship</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that for a triall of that, whether our <hi>Time Deum</hi> be right or no, here's another coupled with it, <hi>Et Regem,</hi> to proove our selves by, <hi>Feare God and the King</hi>; that is, <hi>feare</hi> God in the King, <hi>feare</hi> God by the King, send our <hi>feare</hi> to the King of Heaven by our <hi>feare</hi> to Kings on Earth: <hi>Fili mi</hi> is out of place, unlesse it stand even in the middle between <hi>Deum</hi> and <hi>Regem:</hi> to presume we <hi>feare</hi> God, and yet to goe no further, to make no Conscience of <hi>fearing</hi> Him, that is in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21393:22"/>
Gods stead, or to <hi>feare</hi> him no further, then the lash of his Lawes will reach us; it comes not from <hi>Filius</hi> that, and 'tis but a lame and base <hi>feare,</hi> partly slavish, partly hypocriticall, a great deale short both of <hi>Gods</hi> Due, and of a <hi>Sonnes</hi> Dutie.</p>
            <p>Much lesse shall we finde any place for <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Regem</hi> alone, and leave <hi>Deum</hi> quite out, to begin the Text there, at the <hi>feare</hi> of the King, but no <hi>feare</hi> of God at all; or if any, yet but heartlesse and worthlesse, onely for <hi>feare</hi> of the King. No, without <hi>Deum</hi> (you see) the Text ha's ne're a <hi>Time</hi> here for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem</hi>; no right <hi>feare</hi> of the King, if God be not first <hi>feared.</hi> He that <hi>feares God</hi> but for <hi>feare</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and his Lawes, in truth makes the King his God; and he that <hi>feares</hi> the <hi>King</hi> more then <hi>God,</hi> in heart wishes there were neither King nor God.</p>
            <p>So that in the Conclusion, these two, our <hi>Time Deum,</hi> which is our Religion, and our <hi>Time Regem,</hi> which is our Allegiance, they are sure and perfect Proofes both, either to, either of other. Look what e're is pretended for the <hi>King,</hi> yet it is Fraude not <hi>Feare,</hi> Craft not Allegiance, plaine Brokage, and not Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, unlesse it first issue from the Throne of <hi>Heaven,</hi> spring from true Devotion, and be founded upon Religion. Againe, look
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21393:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what e're is professed for <hi>God</hi> (as where have we not swarmes now of great Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors?) yet it is not <hi>Feare,</hi> but Faction, not Devotion, but Hypocrisie, not Religion, but Abomination, unlesse it fall downe before the Throne upon <hi>Earth</hi> also, be the life of spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Allegiance, and the quickning Soule of all Civill obedience.</p>
            <p>The Text imports no lesse, and God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes no lesse, and no lesse can I charge the Consciences of all that this day heare me with, but TIME DEVM, FILI MI, ET REGEM, <hi>Feare GOD, my Sonne, and the KING</hi>; God and the King, both together; shew a due <hi>feare</hi> of them Both, but yet both in that Order: That so approoving our selves respectively to God and King, as <hi>Sonnes</hi> to both, ingenuous <hi>Sonnes,</hi> here in the life of Grace; our <hi>Feare</hi> at last may be changed into Ioy, and our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion into Fruition, and We be made not <hi>Sonnes</hi> alone, but <hi>Kings</hi> also with GOD, in the life of Glorie, by the Merits of the SONNE of GOD, the KING of eternall Glory, IESVS CHRIST our Saviour:</p>
            <closer>To Whom with the FATHER, and the Blessed SPIRIT, be all Honour and Glorie, now and for ever. AMEN.</closer>
