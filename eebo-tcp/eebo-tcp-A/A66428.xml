            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AFter that I had, for the uſe and ſatisfaction of a private Friend, made ſome enquiry into the Principles of the contemptible Sect, known of late times by the name of <hi>Muggletonians,</hi> I threw the Papers aſide, as thinking the time not at all well ſpent, that I had employ'd in reading their Books, and in the Examination of what is made up of Impiety, Nonſence, and Abſurdities. But however, I was at laſt prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with to permit them to be made publick; which I did ſubmit to, not ſo much for the ſake of thoſe poor deluded Souls that are won over to that pernicious Sect, that having no ſhadow of Reaſon for its ſupport, will not ſubmit to the tryal of it; and ſo are uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Argument; but for the ſake of others: And to give the World an inſtance of the power of Enthuſiaſm, and how far it expoſes Perſons to be led away by the confidence or craft of any Pretender, how ignorant or ſelfiſh ſoever he be.</p>
            <p>And of this ſort were the firſt Ring-leaders of this Sect, <hi>John Reeve</hi> and <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> in the year, <hi>1651.</hi> a time of Univerſal Liberty; and which gave an opportunity for the worſt of Men to vent the abſurdeſt and moſt infamous Errors.</p>
            <p>The former of theſe, <hi>J. Reeve,</hi> by Profeſſion a Baker, pretended that the Lord Jeſus ſpoke to him by Voice of Words three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and with ſuch a <hi>Godlike Majeſty,</hi> that he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I did not know whether I was a Mortal Man, or an Immortal God.</hi> That the Voice told him, that he had given him Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Scripture more than all the World beſides: And that he had given <hi>L. Muggleton</hi> to be his Mouth, and that they two were the laſt Commiſſioners to the World; and the two Witneſſes ſpoken of <hi>Revelation 11</hi>th. who exercis'd a Commiſſion of an higher nature than thoſe of the Prophets and Apoſtles; and that they knew more, and had a greater power than any of them; as they could bleſs or curſe, ſave or damn, to all Eternity irrevocably. And therefore, whoſoever ſhould oppoſe or vilifie this their Commiſſion and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, would be guilty of the unpardonable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Accordingly when theſe two were tried, <hi>1653.</hi> at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> before the Ld. Mayor <hi>Fowke;</hi> and ordered to lie in <hi>Bridewell</hi> ſix
<pb facs="tcp:107010:3"/>
Months, they gave Sentence againſt the ſaid Ld. Mayor, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder<note place="margin">See Letter to Ld. Mayor, and the Remonſtr.</note> 
               <hi>Steel,</hi> and the Jury, after this manner. <hi>In obedience to our Commiſſion received from the Holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce you curſed and damned, Soul and Body, to all Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we come to enquire into their Doctrine, there is nothing more abſurd, falſe, and precarious: As they tell us, God has a Body like that of a Man, of very fleſh and bone; and that the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are only variety of Names: That God the Father left Heaven for a time, and became an abſolute mortal Man; and died, and was buried; and that during his abſence from Heaven, <hi>Elias</hi> did there repreſent him; and was the Protector of God, during his Minority in the Earth; and that God was raiſed from the dead by a compact with <hi>Elias,</hi> who ſurrendred up all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to him.</p>
            <p>They ſay farther, that there was but one Angel that fell, and that he entred into the Womb of <hi>Eve</hi> by her conſent, and there died; and that <hi>Cain</hi> was the very Seed of that Serpent Angel; and ſo was Brother to <hi>Abel,</hi> only on the Mother's ſide. And that from him ſprung all the Carnal Seed of Reprobates, who were not of the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They hold farther, that there is no Devil at all without the Body of Man; and that he is no other than Man's Spirit of unclean Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and curſed Imagination. Nay, ſometimes they will determine as poſitively in matters of Hiſtory and Philoſophy; and tell us from the Lord, that the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles were wrote in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin: That the Sun and Stars are but little bigger than they appear to be: That the Sun's Eclipſe proceeds from its nearneſs to the Moon; and that no one can foretell Eclipſes but by Inſpiration.</p>
            <p>Marvellous Diſcourſes! And which our Aſtronomers and Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack-makers are much beholding to them for. For whilſt Men of Learning in that way thought they went by a certain rule of Nature, and conſtant Obſervation, they think too meanly of themſelves. Theſe new Commiſſioned Men inſtruct them better; and tell them, they write their Ephemerides and Almanacks by Revelation, if they therein infallibly foretell Eclipſes, as what Aſtronomer doth not?</p>
            <p>By this, we have a taſte of theſe new Prophets pretences; and may ſee that their Hiſtory, Philoſophy, and Divinity, are much alike, and the apparent Fruits of Ignorance, Confidence, and Imagination.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall leave theſe to be handled in the following Treatiſe.</p>

            <head>THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MUGGLETONIANS CONSIDER'D.</head>
            <p>IN the treating upon this Subject, there are two Queſtions to be taken into Conſideration; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Whether <hi>John Reeve</hi> and <hi>Lodowick Muggleton</hi> are ſent from God? And, 2. Whether they are the <hi>Two Witneſſes</hi> in the 11<hi>th</hi> of the <hi>Revelation?</hi>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">Whether they are ſent from God?</head>
               <p>I Here premiſe, That a man may pretend to be ſent, and to have a Commiſſion from God, when he is not ſent, and has no ſuch Commiſſion. <note place="margin">Remonſt. p. <hi>4.</hi> Tranſcend. Spir. Treat. p. <hi>6, 7.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So did</hi> John Robins, <hi>of whom</hi> J. Reeve <hi>and</hi> L. Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleton <hi>ſay, that</hi> he is the laſt and great Antichriſt ſpoken of in the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:107010:4"/>
Such alſo were <hi>John Tanee, Bull, Varnum, Evans,</hi> as they confeſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">True Interpret. of Revelat. ch. <hi>75.</hi> n. <hi>3. 5.</hi>
                  </note> So they ſay the Ranters and Quakers were falſe Chriſts and falſe Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore they plead, That</hi> there was a neceſſity of <note place="margin">Look. glaſs. Ch. <hi>22.</hi> n. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note>the witneſs of the Spirit, becauſe of late and at preſent ſo many ſeveral Antichriſtian Spirits are come forth.</p>
               <p>From hence I infer, That unleſs <hi>J<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reeve</hi> and <hi>L. Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleton</hi> can prove that they are ſent and commiſſioned from God, more than thoſe were whom they grant to be Impoſtors and Deceivers; we have no more reaſon to believe they came from God, and were ſent by him, than they themſelves had reaſon to believe that the forementioned Deceivers came from God. For do they ſay they were ſent from God? So did the others alſo declare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore we muſt enquire into the Evidences and Proofs they bring of their Commiſſion. This they grant a proper way.</p>

                  <hi>So [in the Book call'd a</hi> Looking-glaſs]<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If divers Men appear as Witneſſes, or Prophets, immediately ſent forth by a Powerful Commiſſion from the Everlaſting God, are there not certain Divine Seals to diſtinguiſh between thoſe Embaſſadors which are infallible, and them that are but fallible?</p>
               <p>In treating upon this, I ſhall enquire,</p>
               <p n="1">Q. 1. What are the Evidences they bring; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are not ſuch as other Deceivers have alike pretended to, and even exceeded them in?</p>
               <p n="2">Q. 2. Whether there are not as great Evidences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as they have againſt other Pretenders?</p>
               <p>If we prove the former, we prove that they have no ſufficient Evidence; and they have not thoſe <hi>Divine Seals,</hi> which (as they ſay) diſtinguiſh between thoſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107010:4"/>
Embaſſadors that are infallible, and thoſe that are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
               <p>If we prove the latter, then they are no better than Deceivers.</p>

                  <p>Now I ſhall ſhew this is no ſufficient and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Character.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is no diſtinguiſhing Character according to <note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. This is no ſufficient and diſtinguiſhing Character, according to the Apoſtle, if it be alone without other Evidence, and much more is it not ſo, if contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory <note place="margin">2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 17, 18, 19.</note>to Scripture, <hi>we have a more ſure word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It's not ſufficient in it ſelf; not to the Perſons to whom the Voice is ſaid to come: for they may be impoſed upon by Men (as Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> and others were) or by Evil Spirits, or by imagination, as they grant, when they call them <hi>imaginary Voices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And much leſs is it ſufficient to others that heard not the Voice, but only have it from them that ſay
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107010:5"/>
they heard it; and ſo are liable to be impoſed upon by the Craft or Imagination of others.</p>
                  <p>So that if they will pretend to a Voice for the proof of their Commiſſion, we expect to have ſome proof that they had ſuch a Voice, and that this Voice came from God.</p>
                  <p>And eſpecially, becauſe they ſay that they Seal up Men to Eternal Life or Death irrevocably; and that whoever ſpeaks againſt this Commiſſion of theirs, <note place="margin">Remonſt. p. <hi>9, 11, 12.</hi> Tranſcend. p. <hi>3, 6, 8, 9, 41.</hi> Letter to Ld.

                  <p>Which being contrary to the temper of the Goſpel, and what they have no written Authority for, they are oblig'd to ſhew ſuch Proof for as is Infallible, or elſe are groſs Deceivers.</p>

                     </note> II. <hi>Character.</hi> Their Commiſſion is ſuch as never was before, as it's <hi>all Spiritual;</hi> and as they had <hi>more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding than all the World beſides;</hi> and ſuch as never was reveal'd before.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I anſwer the pretence to its being Spiritual is no ſufficient Evidence. For they grant that amongſt thoſe that were Deceivers, there was a great pretence to Spiritual and inward Voices of Power; to Spiritual <note place="margin">Look. glaſs. p. <hi>111.</hi> n. <hi>43. 167.</hi> n. <hi>1, 2.</hi> Tranſc. p. <hi>7.</hi>

And ſo theirs is no more true or Spiritual for their ſaying ſo, than thoſe that they condemn.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To plead that they have more Spiritual Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and that they reveal what was not before, is no more an Evidence that it is true, than it may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107010:6"/>
be that it is falſe. <hi>John Robins</hi> pleaded that he came from God, nay, that he was <hi>the God and Father of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and confirmed it (as <hi>Reeve</hi> ſaith) <note place="margin">Tranſcend. p. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note>by <hi>great Signs and Wonders, ſuch as the Popes could never ſhew, to the amazement of many deceived by him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And, without doubt, he would as readily declare, that he had more Spiritual Underſtanding than all the World beſides; for the Letter of the Scripture is ſilent in it. And this they will grant was ſuch Doctrine as never was before; and conſequently its no ſufficient Plea, nor by which they can prove their Commiſſion to be true, more than <hi>J. Robins</hi> could prove that he was God the Father.</p>
                  <p>It is not then what they profeſs to reveal that is ſufficient; but the point is, whether what they ſo profeſs is true? And that is to be proved by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe, ſuch as Scripture or Miracles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This ſhews the Vanity of what they ſo often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to: As when they ſay,</hi> This is a true Teſtimony, <note place="margin">Tranſcendent. p. <hi>41.</hi> Look. glaſs. p. <hi>92.</hi> p. <hi>93.</hi> n. <hi>25. 99.</hi> n. <hi>37.</hi>
                     </note>that he hath ſent us by his Holy Spirit; becauſe there is none upon this Earth that beareth witneſs unto that Man Jeſus that was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be the only God and Everlaſting Father, but we only.</p>
                  <p>For ſo might <hi>J. Robins</hi> have ſaid, there is none that beareth witneſs but my ſelf, that the Trinity of <note place="margin">Tranſcend. p. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note>Perſons is <hi>Adam, Abel,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> (as <hi>J. Reeve</hi> ſaith he profeſſed.) And ſo might <hi>John Tanee</hi> have ſaid, there is none that beareth witneſs, but my ſelf, that there <note place="margin">Remonſtr. p. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note>is no Perſonal God.</p>
                  <p>It all reſts upon their ſay ſo, but where is the proof? Where is the Scripture, where the Miracles, that they prove their Commiſſion, and their Doctrine by? For to prove their Commiſſion by their Doctrine, is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107010:6"/>
much one as to Prove their Doctrine by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. And yet this abſurd way do they take. For ask them how they prove their Commiſſion? They ſay, Becauſe there is none upon Earth that beareth witneſs that Chriſt crucified was God the Father, but we. Ask them again, how they prove the truth of <note place="margin">Look. glaſs. p. <hi>99.</hi> n. <hi>37, 38.</hi>
                     </note>their Doctrine? They anſwer, by their Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The matter of Fact is not true; for there have been others before them of the ſame Opinion; ſo little reaſon have they to claim the firſt diſcovery to themſelves; as I ſhall preſently ſhew.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It's an ill ſign, that this ſhould be the firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and that for above 1600 years, the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World ſhould know nothing of it, as they themſelves acknowledge.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Character, or Proof of their Commiſſion, is,</hi> That throughout the Book, call'd the <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> there is no point contradicting it ſelf, nor one another; which he calls <hi>an Infallible Proof of the Truth of this Writing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there was no other proof of a Point contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting it ſelf, than what is here aſſerted, that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. For he ſaith, That to have no point contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting it ſelf nor one another in a Book, is an <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Proof</hi> of the Truth of that Writing. By which Argument, every Book conſiſtent with it ſelf, would be neceſſarily true; whereas nothing more evident, than that a Book may be conſiſtent with it ſelf, and yet be falſe.</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance, They ſay that one <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Varnum,</hi> and others long before them, have pretended to be the two Witneſſes in the 11th of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Look. glaſs. p. <hi>99.</hi> n., <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> Suppoſe we now that thoſe two had wrote a Book (as <hi>L. Muggleton</hi> has done) and call'd it, <hi>a True</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:107010:7"/>
                     <hi>Interpretation of the</hi> 11<hi>th of the</hi> Revelation; would that have been a ſufficient proof of the Truth of that Writing, that there was no point in it contradicting it ſelf nor one another? I trow not; and yet no one can deny but ſuch a Book might have been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived. And I durſt have put it to the venture, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if this be true, it would not have been as much a proof of their being thoſe Witneſſes; and they might have alike Subſcribed their Book, as he doth his; <hi>viz. By</hi>—Bull <hi>and</hi>—Varnum, <hi>the two laſt Commiſſionated Witneſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as this is not an Infallible proof of the Truth of the Writing, ſo much leſs of the Divine Inſpiration of it, and of their Commiſſion: For a Book may in all points agree with it ſelf, and contain nothing but Truth, and yet be of Humane Invention.</p>
                  <p>If a Book be inconſiſtent with it ſelf, it's to be ſure not of Divine Inſpiration; but it may be conſiſtent, and yet be only of Man's Compoſition.</p>
                  <p>And yet they fail in this point; for it will be a difficult matter to reconcile it to it ſelf: For they ſay they write from an Infallible Spirit, which implies the <note place="margin">Look. glaſs. p. <hi>14.</hi> n. <hi>29.</hi>
                     </note>higheſt certainty, and yet ſay, <hi>I am perſwaded in my Spirit, and I do rather believe that there was ſeven hundred thouſand, than ſeven thouſand, though the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Revelat. p. <hi>143.</hi> n. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>of</hi> John <hi>doth expreſs it to be but ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>be perſwaded,</hi> and to <hi>believe</hi> a thing to be ſo, are inconſiſtent with Infallibility; for that admits no leſs than I am ſure of it.</p>
                  <p>So again, <hi>Muggleton</hi> ſaith of the Angel St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks of, that <hi>perhaps it was no more to his viſible ſight;</hi> and ſpeaking of St. <hi>John's Revelation,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107010:7"/>
it, <hi>ſo it may be ſaid.</hi> Now theſe words <hi>perhaps,</hi>

                        <hi>Revelat. chap.</hi> 60. <hi>n.</hi> 8. 15. 19.</note>and <hi>it may be ſaid,</hi> are doubtful Expreſſions, and not reconcileable to Infallibility.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. V. VI. Suppoſe theſe Characters to be true for the matter, yet that follows not that they are of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpiration, and Infallible. 1. Becauſe then it would follow that all good Books and true were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. 2. The 5th is what others have held as well as they.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. If the largeneſs of the Book, and the not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any Writing, were Signs of an unerring Spirit, then the Writings of ſeveral Quakers, as <hi>Burroughs</hi> and <hi>G. Fox,</hi> &amp;c. might pretend to it, if they may be believed, who often begin their Books with <hi>The Word of God.</hi> And ſo would thoſe of <hi>Jacob Behem,</hi> who ſaith, he writ without Humane Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>And if the Purity of the Language be a Sign of Truth and Infallibility, then I am ſure that the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of theſe two are far from being either true or infallible.</p>
                  <p>This, it ſeems, was notorious in the former Edition of the <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> 1656. And therefore <hi>L. Muggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Epiſt. prefixed to it.</note>doth wiſely to lay it upon the <hi>Abuſe it received in the Preſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if <hi>L. Muggleton</hi> was the Corrector, and was to rectifie thoſe abuſes by his own <hi>unerring</hi> Spirit, it would have eſcaped no better than his <hi>True Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the</hi> 11<hi>th of the</hi> Revelation, which abounds with falſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> beyond number; and of which I never read a Page that wanted it.</p>
                  <p>And even, that very Book (which this is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken of, <hi>viz. The Looking-glaſs.)</hi> after his Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, fails in the propriety of the Words, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, the Connexion. In the Paragraph juſt before

this bold Challenge and the Appeal he makes to the Purity of its Language <hi>[n</hi> 45.] we find the Word <hi>Toſticated,</hi> a vulgar, but a much miſtaken word, and is for <hi>Intoxicated.</hi> Where is the Concord in the <note place="margin">

                  <p>It's a ſign theſe Perſons did not underſtand true <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor often the Sence of what they wrote, that would venture upon this, and produce the <hi>Purity</hi> of the Language as a Note of an <hi>unerring Spirit,</hi> in the compiling of it.</p>

                  <p>How many things are here taken for granted, which there is not a Syllable of Proof for?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As,</hi> 1. That there was a time when the Apoſtles way of Worſhip was to ceaſe, and actually ceaſed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But yet after all, we think we may as well ſay to them, as they to others;</hi> If thou ſhalt imagine thy ſelf fit to Miniſter, I would fain know of thee, whether thou art indued with a Miniſterial Power?

                     </note>thee by raiſing the Dead, curing the Lame, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus far we have conſidered the Evidences, which are ſuch as are no diſtinguiſhing Characters, and what others may equal them in; and ſo we have no more reaſon to accept them as Commiſſionated, than they had to accept Impoſtors; and have as much reaſon to reject them, as they had to reject other Impoſtors.

                  <p>Nay, if either be accepted, they are ſo to be that exceed theſe in their Evidence, as did <hi>J. Robbins,</hi> who ſhewed many Signs, and preſented his Perſon to ſome riding upon the Wings of the Wind, like unto a Flame of Fire, &amp;c. and did plague the Bodies and

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>Which if it be made good, then what remains for them, but to ſhew their Commiſſion for ſo doing; and if their Authority for it be not proved by as good, clear, and ſufficient Evidence, as the former Commiſſion was confirmed and eſtabliſhed, we have good reaſon to think no better of them than they did of <hi>Robbins, Tanee,</hi> and other Impoſtors.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhall conſider how they differ in Worſhip from the former Commiſſions of <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Of this, let us hear them.</p>
                  <p>This Commiſſion of the Spirit doth hold forth no viſible nor external outward Worſhip, as the other two Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <hi>[of Moſes and the Apoſtles]</hi> did; <hi>[ſo</hi> Muggleton<hi>'s Epiſtle to</hi> Looking-glaſs.] <hi>that is,</hi> All viſible Worſhip from Mens Tongues, Eyes, and Hands, was to be done away; and is now but as a Golden Calf of Mens own i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations; and no more accepted by Chriſt, than the cutting off of a Dog's neck.

                     </note>&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And yet they grant this Viſible Worſhip was the way of the Apoſtles, which did laſt till the end of the ten Perſecutions; and <hi>which was then in great force ſo long as that Commiſſion ſtood,</hi> as <hi>Muggleton</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107010:10"/>
in the foreſaid Epiſtle. So that in this point the Commiſſion of the Apoſtles, and theirs, are inconſiſtent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew, that ſuppoſing they thus differ from the ſecond Commiſſion (that of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) <hi>only in Worſhip,</hi> yet, in ſo doing, they ſo far make void the former Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is granted: for they ſay,</hi> When God doth give a <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Muggleton</hi>'s Epiſt. to Look. Glaſs.</note>New Commiſſion, the Old is made void, as with reference to the Viſible Worſhip. Therefore you know, that the Apoſtles Commiſſion did wholly thruſt out the Viſible Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which was ſet up by <hi>Moſes.</hi> So likewiſe it is with this Commiſſion of the Spirit; becauſe this Commiſſion of the Spirit doth hold forth no viſible outward Worſhip, as the other two Commiſſions did.</p>
                  <p>They own Chriſt's Commiſſion did appoint a Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble External Worſhip, but this of the Spirit (as they call it) doth not, but forbids it; and ſo the latter doth make void the former.</p>
                  <p>Now then, ſince their Commiſſion doth as much make void the Commiſſion of Chriſt, as to External Worſhip, as Chriſt's Commiſſion did that of <hi>Moſes;</hi> we may enquire who gave them this Commiſſion, or how do they prove they received it from God? For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they who will make void the Commiſſion of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, ought in Reaſon to give as good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of a Divine Authority for ſo doing, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gave of his; and ſo much the more, as Chriſt is above <hi>Moſes.</hi> Our Saviour did not expect the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould give credit to him further than he gave them Evidence; and 'tis ſurely then unreaſonable to give credit to theſe perſons without it. And our Saviour's Evidence would have been none, had he only that to ſay for himſelf, which theſe pretend to. Would it have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107010:10"/>
been enough for our Saviour, when the <hi>Jews</hi> required a Sign, to have ſaid, as theſe do, <hi>This is the old Serpent that arraigns the glorious God at the Bar of thy Carnal Reaſon?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Look glaſs., p <hi>185.</hi> n. <hi>26,</hi> &amp;c.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>No: Though our Saviour call'd the <hi>Jews</hi> an <hi>adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Generation,</hi> becauſe they continued incredulous, after the Miracles wrought among them; yet at the ſame time, he tells them that there was one in reſerve which would convince them, or nothing would; which was his own Reſurrection. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 39.</p>
                  <p>It is not neceſſary every one ſent from God ſhould, in every caſe, have this Teſtimony of Miracles, as it was with <hi>John Baptiſt, John</hi> 10. 41. But had <hi>John</hi> come to make void the former Commiſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he muſt have produced the Evidence. And this our Saviour did, and ſo ought theſe to do; or elſe muſt be reckoned among the falſe Chriſts, and falſe Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They differ from the former Commiſſion in many other things as well as Worſhip; and that of ſo great Conſequence, that theſe alone would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſhew, that they thereby make void the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Commiſſion; and ſo muſt be Deceivers, if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Commiſſion; be in force; and it is in force, if they have no Authority to make it void; and they have no Authority, if they have not ſufficient Evidence for it.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes they ſay, there are ſix Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Perſon of God. 2. Perſon of Angels. 3. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Devil. 4. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Condition. 5. Joy of <note place="margin">Remonſtr. p. <hi>7.</hi>

                  <p>Quite contrary to Scripture; which ſaith, God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. And God ſent his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.

                  <p>Did <hi>Elias</hi> give him Power over all fleſh? &amp;c. Was <hi>Elias</hi> the only true God? And would it be Eternal Life to believe in <hi>Elias,</hi> as the only true God? Did <hi>Elias</hi> give him the Work he was to do? And had he

O horrid Blaſphemy!</p>
                  <p>I think that Chapter alone is enough to rid any of this Frenzy. So one while they ſay <hi>Elias,</hi> had charge of God for a Moment, <hi>[Tranſcend. p.</hi> 35.] and yet elſewhere, from his Birth to his Aſcenſion: <hi>[Revelat. p.</hi> 130. <hi>n.</hi> 16.] that he was quickned by the Compact of <hi>Elias; [Tranſcend. p.</hi> 37.] and yet by his own Power <hi>[General Epiſt. p.</hi> 5.]</p>
                  <p>As to the Devils, they ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But one Angel fell.</p>
                  <p>Juſt contrary to Scripture, which tells us of the <hi>Angels</hi> that fell, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. And this cannot be applied to <hi>Cain</hi> and his Poſterity; becauſe, according to theſe Mens Principles, they never fell, being Devils by Extraction and Propagation, and not by Tranſgreſſion and Apoſtacy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Devil entred into the Womb of <hi>Eve,</hi> and there died; and out of him came <hi>Cain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

3. That <hi>Cain,</hi> and none but he, is <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Scripture that ſpeaks of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> being Prince of the Devils, ſpeaks of him as caſting them out, and ſo ſuppoſes <hi>Beelzebub</hi> then in being in his own Perſon; but that cannot then be applied to <hi>Cain,</hi> who is not in Being at all (as they hold) in his Perſon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is no Devil without the body of a Man, and Devils are only Mens Luſts and Imaginations.</p>
                  <p>Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then the Devils which the Heathens and Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites offer'd their Sacrifices and Children to, were their own <hi>curſed Imaginations. Levit.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 35.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then the Devil that tranſported Chriſt, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with him, and that hurried him into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſet him upon a Pinacle of the Temple, muſt be his own imagination.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then the Devils that enabled the young Man to break his Chains; <hi>[Mark</hi> 5. 2. &amp;c.] and that tore and bruiſed the Child, <hi>[Luke</hi> 9. 39.] and that go about to and fro in the Earth, <hi>[Job</hi> 1. 7. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 8.] and that contended with <hi>Micbael;</hi> were only the Luſts of Men; that is, the Luſts of Men broke Chains, bruiſed and tore Perſons, walk'd to and fro in the Earth, &amp;c. which is irreconcileable.</p>
                  <p>As to Man, they ſay the Soul is Mortal, and turns into Duſt with the body.</p>
                  <p>Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture on the contrary tells us, that the Souls of Men are alive after their Departure hence.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>[Matth.</hi> 22. 32.] Our Saviour proves from that Saying, <hi>I am the God of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living;</hi> that is, God is ſaid to be their God after they were Dead;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107010:14"/>
and that he could not have been, had they not been in Being after their Deceaſe.</p>
                  <p>This again our Saviour's argument ſhews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the Soul;</hi> where he not only makes the Soul and Body two diſtinct things, but ſo really ſuch, that the one may be killed, but the other cannot. But if the Soul was mortal and turn'd into Duſt, they would as well kill the Soul as the Body; and would kill the Soul, by killing the Body.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 22. The Beggar that died was carried into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom, and the Rich Man was in Hell. How! not as to their bodies ſurely; for they were left in this World, the Rich Man was buried. And this was before the Reſurrection, for it was while their Brethren were alive, <hi>v.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it muſt be as to their Souls alone, that one was with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the other in Hell.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. They are Deceivers; That plead Divine Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Infallibility, and yet have been guilty of Self-contradiction; and have actually miſtaken in Principles and matter of Fact.</p>
                  <p>It has been juſt before ſhew'd, that they have groſly err'd in their Principles, which are contrary to the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Let us then now proceed to their Self-contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to Errors in matters of Fact, by which it will appear that what they ſay of themſelves, that they are infallible, and not guilty of any miſtake, is one of the number.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhall conſider their Self-contradictions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In one place they ſay,</hi> If any man deſpiſe this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theirs, he commits the unpardonable Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>So the</hi> General Epiſtle, &amp;c. <hi>And yet</hi>

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:107010:14"/>
                     <hi>At one time they tell us, that they</hi> two were the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of the End of the World, <hi>and that</hi> this was to be <note place="margin">Tranſcendent. Spir. Treat. Remonſtr. p. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note>ſuddenly after they had delivered their Meſſage.</p>

                     <hi>At another time it is,</hi> Whoſoever ſhall live to ſee an end of them two, ſhall ſuddenly ſee the Diſſolution of the World. <note place="margin">Remonſtr. p. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the firſt <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> they are to be underſtood of what was immediately to come to paſs; for they ſay <hi>John Robins,</hi> the Man of Sin (as they make him) was to appear a little before the Perſonal Viſible coming of <note place="margin">Tranſcend. p. <hi>6.</hi> Look. plaſs. p. <hi>194. 28.</hi> Ibid. p. <hi>198.</hi> n. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note>Chriſt. And that the Diſſolution of the World was preſaged by the many Fires then happen'd in <hi>London;</hi> and by the Condition of the People.</p>
                  <p>Now this Meſſage of theirs (which the end of the World was ſuddenly to follow) was declared 1651, as appears by their <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> which is above 40 years ſince: And <hi>Reeve</hi> has been dead above 30 years; for it was before <hi>Muggleton</hi> reprinted the Book call'd his <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> 1661.</p>
                  <p>But why ſhould we wait the end of theſe two? for if they be the Witneſſes in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> they are to die by the hands of Violence, and to riſe again, and to aſcend up into Heaven in the ſight of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And <hi>Muggleton</hi> may as well tell us, that it was ſo with <hi>John Reeve;</hi> as he doth that <hi>Moſes</hi> was Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated; of whom the Scripture ſaith, that he died and was buried. <note place="margin">Revelat. c. <hi>59.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But let us proceed to their palpable miſtakes, and which yet they affirm to be true, as well as themſelves to be infallible.</p>
                  <p>And this in the firſt place I take to be one, that they affirm, That they had more knowledge in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures than all the Men of the World beſides; and yet every where betray the groſſeſt ignorance in them.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Muggleton</hi> ſuppoſes <hi>Matthew</hi> to have ſeen the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel at our Saviour's Reſurrection; and gives it as a <note place="margin">Revelat. ch. <hi>9.</hi> n. <hi>8.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5.

2. They affirm that no one ever taught their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as that God the Father died, and that God had a Body, and was in the form of a Man, &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is hardly any thing new, but that there have been ſome as wild and fanciful as themſelves in paſt Ages.</p>

                     <hi>As,</hi> (1) The <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> and <hi>Audians,</hi> and <hi>Manichees</hi> held, that God had a Human body.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Without raking farther into this matter, this is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew, that they are not the firſt Broachers of theſe Doctrines.</p>

diminiſhes in its appearance according to the degree of its Elevation: And conſequently thoſe Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, being vaſtly remote from the Earth, muſt be vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater than they appear to the Eye.</p>

Now what more ſneaking and pitiful! After they have boldly challeng'd this Character to themſelves, to give it over again, and retire from it, as if they fainted under a diſtruſt, and the fear of inconſiſtencies in it. As a Specimen of which, I ſhall compare the Text of Scripture and his Expoſition together.</p>

                  <head>I ſhall now draw all this together, and the Sum of the whole is this.</head>
                  <p>That <hi>J. Reeve</hi> and <hi>L. Muggleton</hi> are the two Witneſſes, the Olive Trees, and Candleſticks ſpoken of in this Chapter. That theſe two were to propheſie 1260 days, beginning in <hi>February,</hi> 1651. And had power to ſave and damn irrevocably to all Eternity, &amp;c. That upon declaring this Commiſſion, the Beaſt out of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit, that is, the Ld. Mayor <hi>Fowk,</hi> the Recorder, and Jury, out of the Pit of their Imagination, made War againſt theſe two aforeſaid Witneſſes, 1653. and killed them; that is, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scripture. And their dead Bodies, which is the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scripture, lay dead in the ſtreets of the hearts of Men. And the People and Kindred ſaw the dead Letter of the Scripture lie dead three days and a half, or 1350 years, and rejoyced at it. But at the end of the 1350 years, in which the Bodies of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, or the Letter of the Scripture, had lay dead, the Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into them, by the Commiſſion given to <hi>J. Reeve</hi> and <hi>L. Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleton,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:107010:18"/>
1651. And ſo the Bodies of the Witneſſes, or Letter of the Scripture, ſtood up again.</p>
                  <p>And it ſhould have been added, That the Witneſſes aſcended up into Heaven in a Cloud, and their Enemies beheld them. But ſoft—for <hi>J. Reeve</hi> has been long dead.</p>
                  <p>Now reconcile all this who can?</p>
                  <p>For, 1. He ſaith that they two are the two Witneſſes, and yet the Bodies of thoſe two Witneſſes are the Letter of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Letter of the Scripture is the Body of the Witneſſes, and that lay ſlain 1300 years before theſe two ſay, they receiv'd their Commiſſion; then the Bodies of them were ſlain before, and 1300 years before, theſe two Witneſſes were in being.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He ſaith, The body of the Witneſſes, or Letter, was ſlain 1300 years before; and yet makes it ſlain again by the Ld. Mayor. And if it was ſlain in his time, then the three days and a half was to begin after his time, and a new 1350 years was to follow.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Obſerve, That in the Revelation, the two Witneſſes had their Commiſſion before the Bodies were ſlain: but if the Bodies of the Witneſſes is the Letter of Scripture, and was ſlain 1350 years ago; then they were ſlain ſo long before theſe had their Commiſſion, which was not till 1651.</p>
                  <p>It's plain, this Shifter knows not where to fix. He would fain, like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> be accounted ſome great One, and he and his Partner would ſet up for Broachers of New Doctrines, how ſordid and contradictious ſoever; but he wants the skill to patch things cleverly together; they are at the beſt but tatters, and can never be brought into one intire piece. And this Expoſition of his is ſo ſorry and pitiful an attempt, that he might as well have undertaken to have proved himſelf and <hi>Reeve</hi> to be the two great Lights in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; and to as good purpoſe have in like manner wrote an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, If confuſion and ſelf-contradiction, may paſs for Expoſition; if confidence and ſelf-aſſuming may paſs for Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if nonſence and obſcurity may paſs for Illumination; if cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and damning others may paſs for Charity; if Blaſphemy may paſs for Religion; then theſe two may be allowed to be what they pretend. But if theſe things will not paſs among Mankind; then they will no more be Prophets and Witneſſes from God, than they will aſcend into Heaven in a Cloud, in the ſight of their Enemies</p>
