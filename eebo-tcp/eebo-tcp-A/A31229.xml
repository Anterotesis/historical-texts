            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Sent Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
this Account at
my Return from
<hi>Candie,</hi> emboldened by
the Orders You were
pleaſed to give me (when
<pb facs="tcp:58324:3"/>
I left <hi>England</hi>) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiant
You with all I
found New abroad;
and this I could by no
means call Old, ſeeing
to me the Cauſe and
Progreſs of the War
was altogether unknown.
From You (<hi>Great Sir</hi>)
it had a gracious Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance,
and from You
again it begs Reception,
ſince by Your Commands
it is now made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique:

Nor will Your
People be unwilling to
hear how miraculouſly
<hi>Chriſtendom</hi> is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

Enemy of our
Faith and Peace.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>Man of
Sin that exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
againſt all that is
called God;</hi> and that
<hi>great Leviathan,</hi> whoſe
Teeth are thought ſo
terrible; yet in his
<pb facs="tcp:58324:4"/>
Noſtrils there is fix'd
a Hook: For certainly
never did Providence
more plainly appear,
then in giving Bounds
to this Monſter at
Sea, where had he been
but ordinarily Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
with terrour he had
appeared at their Doors,
to whom now his Name
is hardly known.</p>
            <p>'Tis in the Deep he
has ſeen Gods Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb facs="tcp:58324:4"/>
and where he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had the leaſt Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
though that be the
Grand Argument of
his Belief and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>That Memorable
Battel of <hi>Lepanto</hi>
made him then know,
That our Vnited Force
could ſtop his Fury;
But now the Victories at
<hi>Fogies, Nixia,</hi> and
the <hi>Dardanels,</hi> have
<pb facs="tcp:58324:5"/>
apparently proclaim'd
his weakneſs, and that
the <hi>Venetians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are more then
Match for him.</p>
            <p>'Tis paſt my reach
(<hi>Sacred Sir</hi>) to find in
Humane Reaſon how
Men ſo approvedly
Stout as theſe Infidels
are, and not unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Affairs, ſhould always
ſo degenerate at Sea, as
<pb facs="tcp:58324:5"/>
to ſeem contemptible to
half their Number,
who have no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Traffique to make
them more Experienc'd

which is yet more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
Why ſhould the
Apoſtates that command
theſe Ships (who were,
whilſt Chriſtians, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for their Valour and
Conduct) turn preſently
inconſiderable, as if
<pb facs="tcp:58324:6"/>
with their Faith they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Bankrupts of their
Natural Talents too!</p>
            <p>The Pyrats of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli,
Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi>
do far excell
all other <hi>Turks</hi> in Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;
nor put they one

are not Renegades, of
eminence in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Profeſsions, and
drawn thither by the
great aſſurance of Gain
<pb facs="tcp:58324:6"/>
and Profit. Yet about
Ten Years ſince, Sixteen
of the beſt of theſe
(ſent as Auxiliaries
to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>)
were ruined by <hi>Lazaro
Mocinigo</hi> (that thrice
worthy General) with
the <hi>Armata Sottile,</hi> his
Fleet at Oars only:
when as one Ship of
the Republiques has in
a dead Calm deſtroy'd
as many of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb facs="tcp:58324:7"/>
Gallies, as he had
then to oppoſe theſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>

            <p>THE Kingdom of
<hi>Candie,</hi> ſince the
taking of <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi>
has ever been the aim
of the Ottoman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
to the end (the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
having no harbour
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58324:13"/>
in the Eaſt) they might fall
upon the Weſt with all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and eaſe.</p>
            <p>In the year 1645. (when
the whole Chriſtian
World was at odds) <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi>
the Father of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Monarch began this
War, who in the depth of
a long Peace unexpectedly
ſet upon the Venetians,
and made this the pretence
of his Quarrel:</p>
            <p>It ſeems in their former
Agreement (among many
other Articles) the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique
did engage not
to give ſhelter to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58324:13"/>
Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> in any of
their Ports or Havens. In
1644. it hapned that the
Galleys of the Order took
a Sultana, who with three
Millions of Crowns was
going to pay her Vows at
<hi>Mecha:</hi> Theſe making
homeward with this great
Booty, were conſtrained ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for want of good
weather, or water, by
ſtealth to ſtrike into a by-Port
of <hi>Candie;</hi> where
(having put on Shore ſome
Horſes they had got) after
Refreſhment they ſafely
returned to their own Iſle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58324:14"/>
The year following the
Turk provided a Fleet (in
great and ſmall) of 460
Sail, proteſting to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
Embaſſadour it was
for <hi>Malta;</hi> but when they
had paſs'd by, neer as far as
<hi>Sapienza,</hi> they again tack't
about, and without the leaſt
Declaration of War, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Sixty thouſand Men,
which preſently ſate down
before <hi>Canea.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique
being in this
manner ſurpriſed, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for their defence as
faſt as they could; yet
before their Courage
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58324:14"/>
was awak'd they loſt
the whole Kingdom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Metropolis <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi>
and three adjoining In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulets
(of much value for
their Ports) <hi>viz. Carabuſa,
Spina longa,</hi> and <hi>Suda.</hi> This
proſperous Succeſs made
then the Grand Signior
own the War, laying open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſheltering the <hi>Malte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
to the charge of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
but had he received
any check at the firſt, 'twas
privately decreed (to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the <hi>Venetians</hi>) that the
Captain Baſſa ſhould loſe
his Head, as if the deſign
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58324:15"/>
had been his Capriccio,
without the leaſt order for
it.</p>
            <p>After the taking of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi>
and <hi>Rhetimo,</hi> they ſoon
became Maſters of the
Field, and in 1648. began
the Siege of <hi>Candie,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
then ſo furious an On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
that they entered the
Breach, and for ſeven hours
were within the Town;
but the Valour of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendents
beat them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with infinite loſs and
damage. In <hi>Anno</hi> 49.
they made another Aſſault,
which proving vain, they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58324:15"/>
have now left off for ever
the thought of winning
the place by Storm.</p>
            <p>On a riſing Ground
(where formerly the Enemy
pitch'd their Tents) neer
three Miles from the Old,
they have built another
Town, which is called
<hi>New-Candie;</hi> here reſides
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and here have
they fortified themſelves,
blocking up the City, ſo
that there's now no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
but by Sea, which
ſends yet plenty of all
things that can be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
or needful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:58324:16"/>
If the Turk were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
here, he had not
the like Succeſs in <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi>
for this being neerer
home, the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſo got
the ſtart, that they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſerv'd their own, but
took whatever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd,
ſtill beating all Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
though thrice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding theirs in number.
Of 46 places taken, none
was preſerv'd but <hi>Cliſſa;</hi>
the reſt they have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
leaving waſte in bredth
at leaſt fifty miles, and ſo
along even to the Confines
of <hi>Albania.</hi> The Towns
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58324:16"/>
upon the Shore (<hi>Zara, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benico,
Trau, Spalato, Almiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,
Cataro,</hi> and <hi>Budoa,</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a defence for the
Gulph, they keep (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
well Fortified: Nor
has the <hi>Turk</hi> on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
but <hi>Narento,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelnuovo,</hi>
both which are ſo
ſhut up with the Gallies
there on purpoſe attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they are able by
Pyracie to do no harm at
all.</p>
            <p>When the War here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
part of the <hi>Morlacks</hi>
(who are <hi>Croats,</hi> or <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matins,</hi>
but ſo called from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58324:17"/>
the Hills where they lived)
revolted from the Sultan,
and threw themſelves into
the Protection of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique:
Theſe, though
kindly received, do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite
the Towns, either
out of fear they may again
fall off, or by reaſon that
having ſtore of Cattle,
they could not attend
them with ſuch commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and eaſe. Their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
then is under the walls
of the Strong Places, where
they build Huts; and here
being well defended, they
lye ſecure, enjoying the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58324:17"/>
advantage of the Fields;
and beſides, whenever they
pleaſe they can make their
plundering Excurſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Enemie's Country.
Againſt theſe the <hi>Turks</hi>
bear a mortal hatred, at no
time giving Quarter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be to put them to
new pains and torments.
Never were people more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile
and ſtrong of Body, or
that could ſuffer hardſhip
with more patience then
they; and yet for all theſe
innate Virtues, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made Souldiers, (I
mean the major part) ſince
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58324:18"/>
no Art will Reduce them
to the exact Rule of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Diſcipline: the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
good they are now fit
for is to do harm, which
commonly happens, they
daily running out in head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Troops, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home with Cattle,
Slaves, and other uſeful
Booty.</p>
            <p>In their Sea-affairs the
Republique is ſo Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
that were the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars at large writ,
'twould ſeem it may be far
more fabulous then true.
'Twas long after the War
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58324:18"/>
broke out before the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
met, the <hi>Venetians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
loth to hazard a Fight,
which had they once loſt,
and the <hi>Turks</hi> become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>
the deſtruction of them,
and of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> too,
perchance muſt have alſo
followed. The firſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
then of their Fleet
was to furniſh their Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Towns with Men and
Neceſſaries; and by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this they had many
private Encounters, in
which having ſtill the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it gave them ſuch heart
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58324:19"/>
and vigour, that ſince the
year 47. they got many
famous Victories, and by
them are become ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
now, that (unleſs it
happen by chance) 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to meet with the
Enemie's Fleet abroad.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the
War the Republique was
at a great expence, their
Officers affirming, That for
the firſt four years they
ſpent neer thirty Millions
of Piſtols, which is above
twenty of our <hi>Sterling</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
And this may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be true; for never was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58324:19"/>
Army more duly paid;
which cauſed the beſt
Souldiers from all Parts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to make Friends to be
in their Service. The Rates
are ſtill the ſame; but
(through their wants by
the length of this conteſt)
the Payment is thought ſo
bad, that at preſent few
come, unleſs they are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited,
as Planters are ſent
to the <hi>Indies.</hi> Seventeen
thouſand (within a little
either under or over) are
the number of thoſe in
this Service; for in the

are not above 6000 in
pay, 1000 more there are
in their other fortified
Iſlands, in the Garriſons of
<hi>Dalmatia</hi> 4000 (beſides a
Regiment which the Pope
maintains at his Charge);
and laſtly, in the Armata
they keep about 6000
more. Thirty ſix Livres
a Month is the Contract
with the Common-Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
and this to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
according to the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
of the place where
they are, which makes the
income different; for 36
Livres in <hi>Candie</hi> amount
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58324:21"/>
not to above 3 Reals, but
in the Army they are equal
to 4<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, or eighteen ſhillings.
Of this, in <hi>Candie</hi> the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
receives 6 <hi>s. 9 d. per
menſem,</hi> and 16 ounces of
Biſquet a day, and in
Clothes to the value of 15
or 20 <hi>s.</hi> a year. In the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata
to each is paid only
4 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> a Month, and the
like allowance of Biſquet
as afore: and after they
have ſatisfied for their
Armes they imbezil, if any
thing remains, their Credit
is own'd, which preſently
the poor wretches ſell for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58324:22"/>
five or ſix in the hundred.
Yet theſe laſt are thought
to fare the beſt, by reaſon
their Duty is eaſier; (for
thoſe of the City mount
the Guard every ſecond
Night) and beſides, are
more in the way of pilfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of ſometimes get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Prizes.</p>
            <p>The Allowance to their
Officers is very different
also: for the <hi>Tramontans,</hi>
or Forreigners (to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
their coming) have
far more then what they
give the <hi>Italians;</hi> and the
pay of both is reckoned
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58324:22"/>
by Ducats, which may be
valued at 3 <hi>s. 9 d.</hi> apiece.</p>

Beſides, in every <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montane</hi>
Regiment there is
the <hi>Stato Colonello</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which is 200 Ducats a
Month; and this to Regalé
his Lieutenant and Major,
who commonly have a
ſhare, though herein he
may do as he pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Every Captain alſo has
<hi>Capo Soldi,</hi> which is about
6 <hi>d.</hi> a Head to an <hi>Italian</hi> a
Month, and 12 <hi>d.</hi> to a
Stranger, for as many as
they have in their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
This Money they
may convert to their own
uſe, but the inſtitution
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58324:23"/>
was to diſtribute it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their diſcretion
amongſt thoſe that did
well deſerve.</p>
            <p>The Reformado's have
half the pay of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Office: And for the
Horſe, they are not 500 in
all, each of which have 16,
the Cornet 40, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
60, and the Captain
120 Ducats a Month, with
ſome other Accidental
perquiſits.</p>
            <p>That which theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
do duly receive for
their monthly Subſiſtance,
is the bread, and about a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58324:24"/>
third of the <hi>Italian</hi> pay;
the reſt is in Arrear for the
greateſt part; and unleſs
they can make good
friends to the Caſhier they
muſt expect long, or ſell
this, as the haſty Common-Souldier
did before them.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Naval
Force which they have, it
conſiſts of three ſorts of
Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> of Galliaſſes,
Gallies, and Ships.</p>
            <p>A Galliaſſe is a Machine
of wonderful advantage in
theſe Inland Seas, being a
Gally in reſpect of its Oars,
&amp; yet reſembling a Ship in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58324:24"/>
its ſtrength and ornament.
Theſe the Republique (of
all Chriſtian Princes) alone
uſe; and though the <hi>Turk</hi>
has many, yet he neither
knows how to make them
ſo good, nor to manage
them with that dexterity
the <hi>Venetians</hi> do. Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Slaves and 300 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
go to the well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one of theſe, which
(being ever the deſtroyer
of Gallies) in a Calm will
be too hard for a Ship;
but if the wind blows, the
Ship is reckoned to have
far the greater advantage.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58324:25"/>
Of theſe there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſix in the Fleet.</p>
            <p>For Gallies, there are in
<hi>Dalmatia</hi> five; one in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu,</hi>
and the like in <hi>Candie</hi>
to be employ'd about Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches;
and in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata
24, each of which,
one with another, carry
180 Slaves, and about 100
or 120 Souldiers. Of
Slaves in their Fleet there
are neer 8000, conſiſting
of <hi>Turks,</hi> of Chriſtians
condemned, or of miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
people that ſell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for about 5 <hi>l.</hi> to the
end of the War. Theſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58324:25"/>
laſt have 4 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> a Month,
and are not put into chains
as the reſt. The daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for all is 18 ounces
of Biſquet, a little Rice
and Oil, and perchance a
coarſe Shirt and Drawers
in the year.</p>
            <p>Of great Ships the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
maintained about
25 formerly, and 16 now,
amongſt which there are
but 5 of their own, the reſt
hired; for they find it leſs
chargeable, or at leaſt freer
from trouble, to be at a
certainty, and that without
hazard, then to lye liable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58324:26"/>
to the Couſenage of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
which all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
are ſubject to: and
were it poſſible to find
Gallies and Galliaſſes,
they would doubtleſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
for them after the
ſame manner alſo.</p>
            <p>The Rate they pay for
Ships is 1650 Ducats a
Month, which comes to
about 305 <hi>l. Engliſh:</hi> For
this the Captain is bound
to keep 60 Sailers, and to
obey all Commands of the
General, as if the Veſſel
wholly belonged to the
Republique.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58324:26"/>
The Ships which they
have of their own are thoſe
they take in War; and
when there are many they
ſell moſt of them, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſtill a few to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Remembrance in
the Eyes of all, of their
remarkable Valour and
Bravery.</p>
            <p>This is the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their Navy; and
with this they ſo affright
the <hi>Turk,</hi> that now, on
purpoſe to engage, he
dares not appear; and
ſhould he ſet to Sea 200 of
the beſt Veſſels he could
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58324:27"/>
get, they would not only
attaque him, but be all
more aſſured of a Victory
then the odds of two to
one can give a ſober
Gameſter. To demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
then the Courage of
theſe, and the fear of the
other, nothing can better
do it then what hapned in
the year 53. For at that
time <hi>Foſculo</hi> (the <hi>Venetian</hi>
General) with the like
Fleet, ſtrengthened with a
few more Ships, drove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Harbour of <hi>Rhodes</hi>
8 Galliaſſes, 80 Gallies,
and 64 Men of War; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58324:27"/>
though he uſed all poſſible
means to provoke them to
fight, yet nothing could
draw them to it. This
made the Admiral of <hi>Malta</hi>
declare, That he look'd
upon that Action as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then all the Victories
they had lately got; for then
the Chance of War (he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged)
was only contrary;
but by this their cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
the <hi>Turks</hi> confeſt
themſelves now fully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
and vanquiſhed.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it muſt needs
be wonderful, that the
Great <hi>Turk</hi> and his ſhould
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58324:28"/>
loſe of all ſorts above 2000
Sail, and yet they never
took but a Gally of the
Republiques, and one poor
Pink of Victuals. Nor has
the <hi>Venetian</hi> loſt by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
of Fire and Storm
30 more, though now the
War hath been of ſo many
years continuance.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot to
acquaint Your Majeſty,
That the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi>
have yearly (till their now
joining with the <hi>French</hi> at
<hi>Gigery</hi>) aſſiſted this State
with 7 Gallies, which is the
uſual number they ever
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58324:28"/>
keep. Yet though theſe
Chriſtian Heroes be as
brave as the Swords they
wear, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet
are no ways fond of the
help; and this, I ſuppoſe,
proceeds from their being
Match enough for the aw'd
Enemy themſelves; and
beſides, they think the
Knights are never back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the Plunder, when
as ſometimes in Service
they will diſpute the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo's
Orders, and
make their own Admiral
Judge whether the Action
be ſafe and fit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:58324:29"/>
That which the Armata
now does (the <hi>Turk</hi> being
thus terrified) is to rove
about the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
Tribute of the Iſles,
and watching for Gallies
that hover up and down,
as alſo for the Caravans of
<hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
they light upon, to the
infinite enrichment of the
Grandees, and to ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
alſo even of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
fry.</p>
            <p>The Iſlands here are all
ſmall, and many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
nor can they be but
poor, ſeeing (beſides their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58324:29"/>
loſs by petty Robberies on
both ſides) they now pay
a conſtant Tribute to the
<hi>Venetians</hi> alſo. Theſe
receive of them about
150000 Crowns <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi>
But the <hi>Turk</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with leſs, as not willing
wholly to deſtroy his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which at preſent he
cannot defend. Though
the Republique thus Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in the <hi>Aegean,</hi> the
Inhabitants think it not ill
ſpent ſtill to pay the Grand
Signior ſomething; and
the reaſon is, becauſe they
know not how otherwiſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58324:30"/>
to be out of danger of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
by ſudden Invaſions,
when the Chriſtian Fleet is
diſtant from them. Of
all theſe Iſles <hi>Cerigo</hi> and
<hi>Tino</hi> are only Fortified by
the Senate. Each of theſe
has a ſmall Fortreſs, which
heretofore they thought fit
to keep, that upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
they might here
have an aſſured Harbour
of their own. Thoſe that
are Garriſon'd by the <hi>Turk</hi>
are <hi>Tenedos, Lemnos, Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
Scio, Negropont, Lango,</hi>
and <hi>Rhodes;</hi> for the reſt,
they are all open Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58324:30"/>
(as I ſaid) to both:
but in more awe of the
Republique, becauſe they
are Maſters at Sea. And
this is a loſs, or at leaſt a
diſhonour (in not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to protect their own)
that the Infidels ſuffer for
their begining of the War.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
alſo hereabouts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqu'd,
and taken ſeveral
Towns and Forts; yet
not with an intention to
keep them, or to go on
with a Conqueſt, ſince
they cannot ſpare Men for
the firſt, and want a ſtrong
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58324:31"/>
Army for the other: but
this they have done, either
to demoliſh ſome Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Place, or to let the
<hi>Turks</hi> ſee, they can Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
on Land as well as on
Sea; or laſtly, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of a new General to
get Reputation, in ſhewing
his Wit and Courage.</p>
            <p>Though no great Prince
had fewer Subjects then
Your Majeſty in this War,
yet none had thoſe that
have done things of more
note; and herein each of
Your three Mighty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
had ſome, that have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58324:31"/>
Served well, and thereby
gained much Honour and
Reputation.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
that Fought bravely, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> (who
had his Ship hired in the
Service) did a moſt prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Action. It hapned
that the Admiral, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Deſign about the
<hi>Dardanels,</hi> put <hi>Middleton</hi>
in ſo deſperate a place,
that he was in danger from
Land to be ſunk at every
Shot. He adviſed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of it, and withal
told him, That the peril of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58324:32"/>
himſelf and Ship did not
ſo much trouble him, as
to be ſet where it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him to offend
the Enemy. Having no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
or at beſt a bad one,
and ſeeing it could not
prejudice the Fleet, he
drew off a little the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
(his only Livelyhood)
from the needleſs danger
'twas in. When the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was over, they diſmiſt
him (in a Councel of War)
with the Title of Coward,
and all the Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken away, he was left
only with ſome 50 <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:58324:32"/>
to return home, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
elſe he pleaſed. He
had not parted long from
the Armata, but in a ſtark
Calm met with 25 Sail, of
which 18 were the beſt
Gallies the Great <hi>Turk</hi>
could make in all his Fleet.
Theſe crying out in deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
That they would eat
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Beef for Dinner,
fell upon him, wanting no
aſſurance, being aſſiſted
with the ſtilneſs of the Air,
and their own Strength and
Number. But for all this
confidence they miſs'd
their aim; for after a long
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58324:33"/>
and ſharp Encounter, the
two Baſſa's that Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
were kill'd, with 1500
to accompany them; and
beſides the many that were
wounded, the whole Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
was ſo ſhatter'd, that
they had hardly Oars to
get off, and were all unfit
to Serve, at leaſt for that
year. The Captain had
neither Wind, Sails, nor
Tackle left to follow
them; but with much ado
he yet afterwards came ſafe
to <hi>Candie,</hi> and there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the General a
whole Tun of ſalted Heads
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58324:33"/>
of thoſe he had killed in
their often boarding. His
Excellency was aſtoniſhed
at the thing, and after all
the careſſes imaginable, he
acquainted the Senate with
it, who with univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Ordered him a Chain
and Medal of Gold, as a
Teſtimony of their high
Eſteem, and his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
Valour. <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton</hi>
afterwards died on
his Journey home, leaving
a Son who Commands here
a Ship, and is very well
eſteem'd by all the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for his Reſolution and
Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:58324:34"/>
About the firſt of the
War Captain <hi>George Scot</hi>
of <hi>Fife</hi> brought alſo a Ship
to the Fleet: He was ſo
skilful in Gunnery, that he
could not only kill a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Man with his Cannon,
but would alſo diſmount
any Piece that offended
the Chriſtians at the Siege
of <hi>Candie.</hi> The Heads of
the Armata had ſuch a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
for him, that he was
uſually admitted into their
moſt privy Debates. He,
when he adviſed them to
an Enterprize, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be the foremoſt in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58324:34"/>
danger; and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he did to his great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
at <hi>Fogies.</hi> The
<hi>Venetians</hi> were there about
20 Ships, and by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
counſel determined
in the Harbour to fire the
Enemies Fleet, conſiſting
of about 140 Sail. <hi>Scot</hi>
entred firſt, though there
was on each ſide a Caſtle
to defend the Port. The
Admiral with the reſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
but having begun
their Deſign preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd,
fearing to be burnt
themſelves, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Night drew on ſo
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58324:35"/>
faſt: In the mean while
the Captain had caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
in the midſt of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> and plying them
every way with his great
Guns, ſo hindred the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of the Fire, that
had the reſt done what
they ought (though alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the damage was great)
there would not have been
(they ſay) ſo much as the
leaſt Maſt left. Every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
gave him over for loſt;
but yet in the morning he
was ſeen to return, not
only with a <hi>French</hi> Pettach
which the Maſter had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58324:35"/>
but alſo accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with a Galliaſs of the
Enemies, and with one of
the flaming Gallies too.
He had a Son with him
from the beginning, who
at laſt was thought the
better Engineer: but
both, to the ſorrow of all,
ſickned and died in the
Service.</p>
            <p>In the year 45. came
Colonel <hi>Brereton</hi> hither,
an <hi>Iriſhman</hi> by Birth and
later Extraction, but ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
of the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
He brought a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
from <hi>Germany</hi> with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58324:36"/>
him, and behaved himſelf
ſo upon all occaſions, in
ordering Affairs, as well as
in perſonal Valour, that
they made him <hi>Sargente
Generale,</hi> and thereby, in
the vacancy, General of
the Arms; which Charge
alſo he ſhould have abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
received, had he not
died (as lately he did) of
a Feaver in <hi>Candie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great Sir,</hi> It is here to
be remembred, That the
Republick truſts no Gally
or Galliaſſe (being of ſo
eaſie a Conveyance, and
thereby a bait for a needy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58324:36"/>
Souldier) out of the hands
of a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> who
for ſuch a ſlight thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be imagined to hazard
his ſo conſiderable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
at home. On the
other ſide, they never give
the Command of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery
to any of their own
Gentlemen; but all the
Officers (except ſome few
of their ordinary Subjects)
from the higheſt to the
loweſt are hired Strangers.
The reaſon is, That finding
the <hi>Roman</hi> Republique
(which they much imitate)
was always endangered,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58324:37"/>
and in the end ruined by
its own Nobilities too
much knowledge in War,
and intereſt with the Men
at Arms, they ſtrive to
make theirs Stateſmen and
Overſeers, leaving the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive
part to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of Fortune, whom
Money has made their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
And moreover, by
this gathering of Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
their People are not
leſſened, few of their own
being loſt, though in an
overthrow the number of
the Slain be great.</p>
            <p>But 'tis not (<hi>May it pleaſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58324:37"/>
Your Majeſty</hi>) for all this
to be thought, they blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leave all to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Strangers: for
they reſerve the directive
Power to themſelves; and
to that end chuſe every
three years a Captain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
commonly a graver
Senatour then knowing
Souldier. To him for the
avoiding confuſion and
Parties (like to the old
Dictators) is given the
whole Authority of the
Senate: He then adviſes
with the <hi>Capi di Guerra</hi>
(who are all alſo Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58324:38"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> the Provedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore,
the Captain Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
of the Galliaſſes,
the like Officer of the
Ships, with ſome others:
and after he has heard
their Opinions, abſolutely
determines himſelf: and
then the General of the
Arms in the beſt Military
Order he conceives, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes
his Commands and
Will.</p>
            <p>In this ſort then do they
ballance the Ambition of
their own, in uſing them
to adviſe and not to act;
and hereby can they check
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58324:38"/>
the inſolence of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
in taking away all
direction from them, and
puniſhing the leaſt grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
with a ſevere Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement.</p>
            <p>Thus (though in ſhort)
may be ſeen the manner
of this War, which began
through the <hi>Turks</hi> unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
avarice of getting
<hi>Candie;</hi> and without this,
'tis certain they can never
be quiet in the <hi>Levant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, They have
got the Kingdom (the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
without their
Walls having not a foot
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58324:39"/>
left); yet are the <hi>Turks</hi>
ſtill fruſtrated in their
aims, ſince they have no
one Port to winter a Fleet
in; and on the contrary,
the Chriſtians have here
the ſame Harbours as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
for their Navy or
Free-booters, and more
elſewhere then they had
before the beginning of
the Troubles.</p>
            <p>The advantage the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
has now got, is hardly
yet of greater conſequence
then the enjoyment of ſo
much Ground, for which
he has paid (beſides infinite
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58324:39"/>
diſhonour and loſſes) at
leaſt 400000 Men; when
as on the ſide of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique
there died not a
fourth of this, though the
Clime and Peſtilence
were great deſtroyers; nor
could the tenth of the loſs
be called their own and
proper Subjects.</p>
            <p>After all this ſtir, and
purchaſe at ſo dear a rate,
it is a moſt certain truth,
The <hi>Turks</hi> are here now
thus weak, that a ſudden
Recruit of 10000 Men
would utterly beat them
out of the Iſland: All peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58324:40"/>
do therefore wonder
why it is not done: But
ſome of the Reaſons I find
for it are theſe enſuing.</p>
            <p>To get this Supply muſt
be by the Aid of Forreign
Princes, or by Levies made
at their own Charge.</p>
            <p>From Chriſtian Allies
the Force now required
cannot be expected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sollicitation and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies;
neither if this
would obtain it, could it
be done without the
<hi>Turks</hi> having notice of it;
and doubtleſs thereupon
would they ſend a Supply
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58324:40"/>
to their own, by which,
what ſo many Men at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
can, twice the number
perchance will be ſcarce
then ſufficient to perform,
but more eſpecially if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
(through ſome
diſguſts, or by their not
being able to do what they
came for) this friendly
Succour ſhould retire, the
Republique will be left
with a ſtronger Enemy on
their hands, and ſo in a
worſe condition then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>If it be expected the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
ſhould do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58324:41"/>
I muſt anſwer, I
verily believe they are
not able, having run
behind (as they ſay) ſo
much in the beginning;
But if at laſt, through pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Contributions, they
could for once make ſuch
a Levy, yet this their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
would be ſoon
known, and moſt of the
ſame Inconveniences fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
And thus if not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to finiſh the Project
(the <hi>Turks</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd)
double the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thoſe that now keep
Garriſon, muſt be hereafter
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58324:41"/>
requiſite. Nor can it be
but hard to maintain new
comers, ſince through the
poverty of the Publick
they are forc'd to ſhuffle
with the few that Serve.</p>
            <p>So much does the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
yet cunning State
fear over-briskly to engage
this lazy Prince, leſt Anger
ſhould raiſe him to that
Life and Fire, which by
experience his Natural
Temper never can.</p>
            <p>The moſt obvious and
eaſie way now left with
this little Supply to regain
<hi>Candie,</hi> ſeems to be, when
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58324:42"/>
the <hi>Barbary</hi> Pyrats ſhall
provoke <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to
puniſh their Robberies, to
take that opportunity of
ſending from their Coaſt
20 Sail, which with a fair
Wind in ten days will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
arrive at the Iſle.
The very ſight of ſuch an
unexpected Succour will
ſo amaze the <hi>Turk,</hi> that
wiſe men think he will ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate
and be gone; but
no body doubts of the
Succeſs if they come to
blows, ſince all his ſtrength
here amounts not to
20000 good Men, which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58324:42"/>
being in diſmay by this
unlook'd for help, cannot
be able to reſiſt the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Army, both thus rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd,
and alſo aſſiſted by
60000 Natives, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened
by the new Aid
will undoubtedly be up in
three days.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this,
they make no queſtion at
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> of getting
in the end the Place: for
they well imagine how
poor the Publique is, and
that the report of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to keep touch
with their Militia, has
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58324:43"/>
done them ſuch diſcredit,
that ſcarce any now volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
come to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
They know too,
that the Taxes are heavy
on the <hi>Venetian</hi> Subjects,
and hope thereby they
may be moved through
deſperation to Rebel, it
being impoſſible (they
think) to feed them much
longer with the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Peace, which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
has made them bear
their Load with ſuch Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
and patience.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the War, as
it is now managed, coſts
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58324:43"/>
the Grand Signior little,
the Iſland maintaining the
Force he hath there; and
for the preſent havock at
Sea, it commonly belongs
to private Merchant-men;
and therefore he reſolves
to depend upon time,
which as it brings change,
ſo if it proves in the leaſt
unfortunate to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,
he is certainly
ſure of his ends.</p>
            <p>After this manner does
he think to weary out the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> and in fine force
them to ask Peace, which
he reſolves not to grant,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58324:44"/>
unleſs it be bought with
the ſurrendring of <hi>Candie,</hi>
and its other remaining
appendices.</p>
            <p>The Senate being well
convinc'd of this, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
part (as the Rich
and the Old, who neither
want, or are fit for Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
wiſh for an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
on theſe Terms;
for fearing the concluſion
will be thus, they deſire
betimes to ſpare their own
and Subjects Purſes; but
the Major part are ſtill for
War: And this is alſo
thought to move them to
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58324:44"/>
1. Firſt, The Gain the
Men of Action make by
the Trouble: For hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Publique Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was to a Miracle full,
and the Nobility poor;
now, on the contrary, by
the Prizes yearly taken, by
the advantage of Offices,
and by often buying De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentures
of the Souldiers
for 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
are all rich, whilſt
the <hi>Cecca</hi> is wholly exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
and dry.</p>
            <p>2. The aſſurance that
no Chriſtian Prince will
either now quarrel or plot
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58324:45"/>
againſt them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore
they deem it prudence
to be yet in a way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining
the Kingdom, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
while by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they protect their dear
<hi>Terra Firma</hi> from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
it ever lies ſubject to,
by the ſtill pretending
Succeſſors of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
in the League of
<hi>Cambray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The incertainty how
long after this alſo they
ſhall be yet quiet; for
'twould be ridiculous by
ſo diſadvantageous a loſs
to purchaſe Reſt, when 'tis
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58324:45"/>
impoſſible to be aſſured
but the following Month
a new pretext of War will
be found, unleſs they yield
up <hi>Zante, Cephalonia,</hi> and
<hi>Corfu,</hi> and ſo <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the
chief Arguments which
make them refuſe all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this ſort; and the
rather, ſince by the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the <hi>Turk</hi> they
doubtleſs may ſuſtain this
defenſive War with their
own yearly Income: But
they pretend they are in
Debt, and that 'tis not half
enough.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58324:46"/>
Republiques are always
ill Managers of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
when great and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Disburſements
are made: for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
and Payments paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
through ſo many
hands of their own, every
body gets: Nor are they
yet in fear of puniſhment,
if their Thefts exceed not
all ſhame, ſeeing their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
are their Judges;
and beſides, each man
knows for the moſt part
himſelf guilty of what is
imputed to his fellow.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> had year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58324:46"/>
heretofore to the value
of 800000 <hi>l. Engliſh,</hi>
and perchance have half
as much more now by their
unuſual Impoſitions; and
to ſpeak truly, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible
Charges are
great: for (beſides the
Robberies of Miniſters,
and the numerous Civil
Magiſtrates, that draw
much) they muſt not be
look'd upon as if <hi>Candie,
Dalmatia,</hi> and the Fleet
were the only things of
Expence: <hi>Iſtria</hi> and <hi>Friu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi>
(which are parts of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>)
lie ſometimes liable
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58324:47"/>
alſo to the Incurſions of
the <hi>Turk:</hi> Nor were it
prudence in them wholly
to disfurniſh their Eſtates
in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which is
bounded with ſo many ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Princes.</p>
            <p>For their better continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the War, there's hopes
ſtill left, that their Subjects
will patiently bear the
Taxes impoſed without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections.
'Tis the preſent
Cuſtom of the Senate to
ſend for Money with a
Complement (calling it a
Donative) to the Towns
and Territories belonging,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58324:47"/>
(as <hi>Padua, Vicenza, Verona,</hi>
&amp;c.) and then the Chief of
theſe Places raiſe it as they
themſelves think fit. Now
theſe well know, if the
War upon neceſſity ſhould
end, by reaſon of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
to contribute, That
the Senate being in Peace,
will no longer entreat
them to give this, but then
force them to pay more,
both to puniſh their crime,
and alſo to re-fill their
drained Coffers againſt a
new occaſion: For 'twould
be a folly in them to think
ever to quiet the <hi>Turk</hi> by
Conceſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:58324:48"/>
To make the <hi>Port</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
from troubling <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi>
is not by yielding,
but by ſending them home
with Loſs. Were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Enemy unken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell'd
here, he muſt needs
return with great confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and diſgrace: For this
footing which he has now
in the Kingdom, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing he can ſhew for
the unſpeakable damage
that from time to time he
has ſuffer'd; yet ſhould he
at laſt maſter the Place, he
would not think he has
paid too dear, ſeeing by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58324:48"/>
the purchaſe he quite
drives the Chriſtians out
of the <hi>Levant;</hi> and let
them then be never ſo
ſtrong at Sea, without a new
Conqueſt they can only
moleſt and not hurt him;
for the weather and want
will force them back, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him his deſired Rule
and Signory. Beſides, with
<hi>Candie</hi> muſt alſo fall <hi>Zante,
Cephalonia,</hi> and perchance
<hi>Corfu</hi> too; both the firſt
Places being inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for ſtrength, but of
wonderful utility to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi>
as a Receſs for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58324:49"/>
their Fleet, and abounding
in all kind of Plenty. If
then theſe Iſlands be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<hi>Italy</hi> muſt needs be in
an ill condition, the <hi>Turks</hi>
Navy Harbouring ſafely
ſo neer, with which he can
Land in a trice what men
he pleaſe, whenſoever he
ſhall think fit to Invade.</p>
            <p>When I arrived here, I
much admired why the
Enemy from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Continent did
not on a ſudden Tranſport
9 or 10000 Men, and
thereby poſſeſs himſelf of
theſe places that are weak,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58324:49"/>
being a great loſs to his
Foes, and ſo pertinent for
his Deſigns and Buſineſs.
But I have ſince found (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the <hi>Venetians</hi> poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of preventing) there
are other cauſes that whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divert him from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</p>
            <p>As, first, Should he make
the Surprize now, yet he
could not accompliſh his
purpoſe of ſetting upon
the Weſt: For ſeeing the
Infidels declare, They are
not to encreaſe their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
by Victories at Sea,
they will at no time wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58324:50"/>
engage with the
Chriſtian Fleet; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
confeſs by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
they have had, That
theirs is at preſent to
Tranſport Men and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
and not to Fight.
Now whilſt <hi>Candie</hi> ſtands,
and the other Harbours
that depend on its reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
if the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhall
ſend their Navy to fall on
<hi>Italy,</hi> they are ſure to be
met by ours, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
will ruine them
as often as they are aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And thus till they
have wholly ſubdued the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58324:50"/>
Kingdom, they can have no
ſafe paſſage for their Fleet
to theſe Iſles, let them take
what Seaſon of the Year
they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Again, It thwarts the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Maxim, to hazard
much (without an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſible
neceſſity) in the
getting of a place, whilſt
behind there remains
ſomething yet to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd;
And their ground
for it is, That undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believing one day to be
Maſters of the whole
World, the method to be
uſed is a progreſſion by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58324:51"/>
and Patience; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
firſt the thing next
them, and then what bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
upon what they got
laſt: And by this means
they are not only free from
an Enemy at their backs,
and danger in Retreats,
but have thus lull'd aſleep
Chriſtianity hitherto, as
thinking it ſelf yet far
enough from danger, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
loſt but one Town
more then it had before.
But ſhould the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
on a ſudden ſtep too
forward (as when by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Otranto</hi> he got
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58324:51"/>
footing in <hi>Italy</hi>) he is
ſure to be preſently beaten
out, and in danger alſo to
awake his Enemies ſo far,
that all Chriſtian Princes
might again joyn in a
League, which is the only
thing he fears. To avoid
therefore this, when <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom</hi>
is at Peace does he
commonly begin a War
with <hi>Perſia;</hi> and if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
differences break
out, he leaves then that
uſually fruitleſs Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
to gain upon them,
who, were they united,
would Conquer more in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58324:52"/>
Five years then ever he yet
got in Fifty.</p>
            <p>I cannot think this
(<hi>Royal Sir</hi>) altogether a
Chriſtian Bravado, but that
which may be proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
imagined, if I look
upon what the glorious
<hi>Venetians</hi> themſelves with
a ſmall Number have done,
or conſider how deſtitute
of Men and Strong Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
all his Provinces are;
or laſtly reflect upon the
wideneſs of his Dominions
on this Sea; ſo that 'twere
impoſſible to defend them
all were they ordinarily
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58324:52"/>
populous; but they are
not ſo, as I ſaid; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
moſt of the people
there are alſo Chriſtians.
I cannot eſtimate his
Strength by what it is in
<hi>Hungary,</hi> and thereabouts;
for thoſe Frontiers being
but comparatively little,
he can defend them with
his prime Men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if ever his ruine be
by force, he muſt be plaid
with on that ſide only, and
attaqu'd on this. Here his
Enemies may pick and
chuſe; and if by chance
one Country be found
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58324:53"/>
well mann'd, the Wind
without charge in 24 hours
will carry them to another,
which a hundred to one
will yield without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
Doubtleſs he is
but weak, as may be ſeen
by his late utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
And yet his ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Greatneſs ſtrikes ſuch
terrors in every body neer
him, that all now allow
there is no <hi>medium</hi> left, but
either Chriſtianity muſt
deſtroy this Antichriſt, or
he it; that is, in their Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Rule and Dominion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:58324:53"/>
The preſent State then
of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Affairs is;
The City of <hi>Candie</hi> is in a
good condition, the Iſland
loſt; in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and the
Sea they have had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and yet the <hi>Turk</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
his ends: And this is
a Misfortune the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
has, That their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Neighbours think they
want no help: And thus
may they be tired out, if
not beaten at laſt, to the
infinite loſs of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gracious Sir,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, No War
(as hitherto) was ever
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58324:54"/>
more extravagant then
this; for in it the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
has loſt a Kingdom,
and yet are ſtill Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
And though the
<hi>Turks</hi> be Conquerors, the
World may nevertheleſs
ſee, That they are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Invincible.</p>

            <p>ON the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi>
1664. the preſent
Generaliſſimo <hi>Andrea Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi>
Embarqu'd himſelf at
<hi>Malamocco,</hi> who civilly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
my Reſolution of
accompanying him into
the <hi>Levant.</hi> It was then
the expectation of all that
much would be done that
year, ſince the <hi>Turk</hi> had
drain'd himſelf to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in his great Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58324:55"/>
againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
But yet the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
did nothing, wanting
what they ſaid they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
and ſo on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
<hi>October</hi> following I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Venice</hi> with <hi>Nicolo
Cornaro</hi> the General of
<hi>Candie,</hi> to whom I was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
obliged for many
favours in his Government,
on the Seas, and in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaretto</hi>
alſo. You muſt
know none comes ever
from the Eaſt into <hi>Italy</hi>
without keeping a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantena,</hi>
which is fourty
days Separation, to try
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58324:55"/>
whether he be infected
with the Plague or not;
and the reaſon is, becauſe
they have a received Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
That the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors
Dominion is never
free from that Peſtilential
Contagion. In the <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto</hi>
then, or place of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration,
I had time to
digeſt theſe Obſervations;
and this I can aſſure you
(<hi>Reader</hi>) that the matter
of fact is undoubtedly
true, ſince I made uſe of
nothing which was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the chiefeſt
Commanders, and thoſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58324:56"/>
of different Nations and
Intereſts.</p>
            <p>Here we had News of
the diſhonourable Peace
made with the <hi>Vizier</hi> by
the Court-party at <hi>Vienna,</hi>
which ſav'd his Head, but
brought them little Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Reputation; for
the Chriſtians were not
only the death of old <hi>Ali
Baſſa</hi> (their beſt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
with ten thouſand Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries;
but put the whole
Army into ſuch a conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that had <hi>Montecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi</hi>
purſued his advantage,
it had been the greateſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58324:56"/>
Victory perchance that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was.</p>
            <p>Never were the <hi>Venetians</hi>
more troubled then at this
Accommodation; for now
their Enemy had no body
to divert his Fury, and was
ready alſo on the Confines,
with all manner of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
to fall the next
Spring upon <hi>Dalmatia.
Cataro</hi> was the place they
feared would be firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted;
nor is it ſo ſtrong
but that they might well
apprehend a danger.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtood their Affairs
when I took leave of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58324:57"/>
General for <hi>Rome;</hi> nor did
the Senate then think of
any thing but defence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
quitted all thoughts
of regaining the Kingdom
of <hi>Candie.</hi> Yet this real
occaſion of fear at laſt
blew over; for the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi>
Army (as it were) quite
mouldred away through
the looſneſs of the Grand
Signior, having wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
himſelf to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
Nor did the <hi>Vizier</hi>'s
coolneſs contribute little,
who was newly eſcaped
from an eminent danger in
<hi>Hungary,</hi> and therefore
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58324:57"/>
now cautious how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
a new project, ſeeing
his utter ruine muſt needs
accompany the unſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs

to the late <hi>Vizier;</hi> a
thing not to be parallell'd,
as I take it, in all their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
He is eſteem'd a man of
Wit, and a great preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to Aſtrology, but no
Souldier; which though it
may well agree with the
Conſtitution of a Chriſtian
Government, yet never
can ſuit theirs: for not to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58324:58"/>
go forward in Conqueſt,
with them is aſſuredly to
effeminate their Men, and
preſently to relapſe into a
far worſe condition. His
being otherwiſe bred
makes him not beloved
by the Militia; and this
is encreaſed by the hatred
they bore his Father: for
after the Men at Arms had
murthered <hi>Ibraim</hi> the late
Emperour, upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
of him that now
Reigns an Act of Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
paſſed, to pardon the
numerous Guilty. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
the old <hi>Baſſa</hi> found
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58324:58"/>
means by degrees (upon
other pretences) to bring
all to execution; which
thing, though by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it has half ruined the
Empire (in ſcarce leaving
one good Officer behind)
yet the puniſhing of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides
has entailed ſuch a
Bleſſing on him, that he
went not only with gray
hairs to the grave, but left
his Son alſo Heir to his
wonderful Greatneſs and
Power.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> having
weather'd this Storm, and
thereby diſcover'd the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable

Lethargy of the
<hi>Port,</hi> reſolved to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
again, and now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the driving them
out of the Iſland. The
Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
General of the
Arms, who is a <hi>Ferrareſe</hi> by
birth, and was formerly in
the Service of <hi>Savoy:</hi> He
was not in the Army du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my ſtay, <hi>Vert-Miller</hi> a
