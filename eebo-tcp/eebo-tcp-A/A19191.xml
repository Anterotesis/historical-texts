            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now, R. Honorable, thirty yeeres ſince I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to your L. and the late Earle of Leiceſter my Lord and Maſter, the hiſtorie of COMMINES rudely tranſlated into our vulgar toong, the which of later times at the requeſt of the late Lord Chauncellor ſir Chriſtopher Hatton, I peruſed anew, and enlarged with ſuch notes &amp; pedegrees as ſeemed neceſſarie, as well for explanation as (in ſome few places) for correction of the hiſtorie. Since his death, certaine gentlemen to whoſe hands the booke happened to come, tooke ſo great pleaſure and delight therein, that they determined to put it to the preſſe, ſuppoſing it a great diſhonor to our nation, that ſo woorthy an hiſtorie being extant in all languages almoſt in Chriſtendome, ſhould be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ours. Notwithſtanding their reſolution, they forbare of curteſie to put in execution till their purpoſe ſhould be made knowen to me. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that I alleaged many reaſons why in my conceit bookes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, treating of Princes ſecrets were vnfit to be publiſhed to the vulgare ſort, the rather bicauſe the Author in ſome places ſeemeth to be of that opinion himſelfe: yet none of my reaſons could preuaile, but they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in their former determination: adding thereunto, that others beſides my ſelfe had taken paines in this hiſtorie, and though I of peeuiſhnes would ſuppreſſe my labors, yet they would not ſuppreſſe theirs. So that would I nould I to the preſſe the booke muſt go, being already warranted by publike authoritie thereunto. I ſeeing the matter aduaunced thus far, thought it no time to draw backe any longer, but in the end tooke the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vpon my ſelfe, doubting if I had done otherwiſe, both the blemiſhing of the hiſtorie, wherein I may boldly ſay, that I haue more trauelled than any man that hath entermedled therewith; and alſo that the worke ſhould

be preſented to ſome patrone that had no intereſt therein. Wherefore hauing againe examined it, and freed it from ſome faults that me thought fit to be reformed: I haue preſumed to publiſh it vnder the protection of your Lorſhips honorable name, to whom of right it appertaineth in many reſpects. Firſt, bicauſe the author thereof was a noble man, one of your owne cote, the wiſeſt, and the beſt acquainted with all matters of ſtate of any man in his time. Whereunto I adde, that he continued a Counſellor ſucceſſiuely to ſo many French Kings, that he was reputed one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt Counſellors in Chriſtendome at his death: wherein your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips fortune is not onely correſpondent, but hath alſo ſurmounted his. Secondarily, your Lordſhip hath the aiſne title to it, and laſtly the right of ſuruiuor caſteth it vpon you by courſe of common lawe. Wherefore all theſe circumſtances well conſidered (my particular duties alſo notforgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) I thought it a kinde of ſacrilege to ſuffer your Lordſhip to be robbed of your right. May it therefore pleaſe you to receiue this hiſtoric into your honorable protection as your owne, as well in regard of the Author, being a man of ſuch condition as aboue is rehearſed; as alſo of the worke, treating of that ſubiect wherewith your Lordſhip at this day is better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted than any man liuing: and laſtly, in reſpect of your owne title thereunto.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>HILIP DE COMMINES author of this preſent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, was borne at Commines a towne in Flaunders, being a gentleman of a very ancient houſe, and ioined by blood and alliance to the beſt of that nation. His ſurname was <hi>Clytus,</hi> his father &amp; vncle had been both of them vnder D. <hi>Philip</hi> of Burgundy chiefe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, of Flaunders called by <hi>Meyer, Summi pretores Flandriae;</hi> and to them he giueth this title: <hi>Domini Ruſcurii, Buſcurii &amp; VVatenenſes:</hi> whereby appeereth of how great Nobilitie and goodly reuenewes <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> was, not onely in Flaunders, but alſo in Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault. In his youth, namely, from the nineteenth yeere of his age, and the yeere of our Lord 1464. till the 27. of his age, and the yeere 1472. he ſerued <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Burgundie, and afterward <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth of that name King of Fraunce, who emploied him in his weightieſt and ſecreteſt affaires. He was of tall ſtature, faire complexion, and goodly perſonage. The French toong he ſpake perfectly and eloquently, the Italian, Duche, and Spaniſh reaſonably well. He had read ouer verie diligently all hiſtories written in French, eſpecially of the Romaines, and bare them all in memorie. He much acquainted himſelfe with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, thereby to increaſe his knowledge. He had great regard to the ſpending of his time, and abhorred all idlenes. He was of an excellent, yea an incredible memorie: for he often indited at one time to fower Secretaries, ſeuerall letters of waightie affaires appertaining to the ſtate, with as great facilitie and readines, as if he had had but one matter in hand. A vertue ſo rare that I haue not read the like of any but of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> and him. Nothing more greeued him, than that in his youth he was not trained vp in the Latin toong, which his misfortune he often bewailed. After he was entered into the ſeruice of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> he was highly in his fauour, and during his raigne bare great ſway in the realme. The ſaid King alſo greatly aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him: for he made him firſt one of his priuy chamber, then of his priuy Counſell, Seneſchall of Poictu, and Lord of Argenton. He married being of good yeeres a gentlewoman of the houſe of <hi>Montſoreau</hi> vpon the borders of Aniou, named <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> But after King <hi>Lewis</hi> his death, he fell into great troubles: for bicauſe he was a ſtranger, many enuied his proſperitie, ſo far foorth that at the length his enimies cauſed him to be impriſoned in the caſtle of Loches in the Duchie of Berry, (a place appointed onely for thoſe that are attached of high treaſon) where he was verie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely handled, as himſelfe in his hiſtorie reporteth. Notwithſtanding his wife by earneſt and continuall ſute, in the end obtained ſo much fauour, that he was remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thence and brought to Paris: where when he had remained a certaine ſpace, he was led to the parlament houſe to be arraigned. He had many enimies &amp; thoſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and of ſo great authoritie at that time in Fraunce, that for feare of them no Counſellor durſt plead his cauſe: wherefore neceſſitie enforcing him to defend him
<pb facs="tcp:7649:4"/>
ſelfe, he pleaded there by the ſpace of two howers, being very attentiuely heard by the whole audience, and in the end ſo acquite himſelfe, that by the Iudges ſentence he was diſcharged. Among other things he rehearſed at the bar how ſundrie trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and daungerous voiages he had ſuſtained for the King and the common wealth. How highly King <hi>Lewis</hi> both had fauoured him, and for his faithfull ſeruice rewarded him: for his owne part, he ſaid that he neuer had done any thing couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ambitiouſlie, nor cruelly: and further, that if he had ſought onely to aduance and inrich himſelfe, he might haue had as goodly poſſeſſions as any man in France. He was priſoner in almoſt three yeeres. The next yeere after his deliuerie he had a daughter borne named <hi>Iane,</hi> which married with <hi>Rene</hi> Earle of Pantabria deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Dukes of Britaine, by whom among diuers other children ſhe had iſſue <hi>Iohn</hi> late Duke of Eſtampes, Lieutenant of Britain, Knight of the French Kings or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Lord of diuers goodly Seniories. But to returne to <hi>Commines,</hi> in proſperity he gaue for his poſie this ſentence: <hi>He that will not labour let him not eate:</hi> but in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie this, <hi>I ſailed into the deepe of the ſea, and a ſudden tempest ouerwhelmed me.</hi> He died the threeſcore and fourth yeere of his age, the yeere of our Lord 1509. the 17. day of October, in his owne houſe of Argenton in the countrey of Poictu, from whence his body was conueighed to Paris, and there lieth buried in the Auguſtine Friers. I was heere purpoſed to haue ſtaied my pen, and further not to haue ſpoken either of <hi>Commines</hi> hiſtorie or his life, had I not called to minde diuers accuſations of <hi>Iacobus Meyerus,</hi> who in ſundrie places of his Annales of Flanders inueigheth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bitterly as well againſt <hi>Commines</hi> life as his hiſtorie, whoſe accuſations I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to laie open to the iudgement of the world, to the end it may appeere whether they be grounded vpon iuſt proofe. Notwithſtanding before I enter into the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of them, thus much in the commendation of <hi>Commines</hi> hiſtorie I cannot paſſe ouer in ſilence, that two of the greateſt and woorthieſt Princes that raigned in Europe theſe hundred yeeres; namely, the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt King of Fraunce, made ſo great account of this hiſtorie, that the Emperor caried it continually about with him, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did the workes of <hi>Homer,</hi> no leſſe eſteeming it than he did them, and the King was as much diſpleaſed with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and publiſhing thereof, as was the ſame <hi>Alexander</hi> in times paſt for the ſetting foorth of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> workes called <hi>Acroamatica,</hi> as rehearſeth <hi>Gellius:</hi> ſo deſirous was he to haue reſerued to himſelfe and a few of his owne ſubiects the great treaſures of wiſedome hidden in this ſmall volume. But let vs now heare what <hi>Meyer</hi> obiecteth againſt this hiſtorie. In the 17. booke of his Annales of Flaunders writing of the battell fought at Saintron betweene <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Burgundie and the Liegeois, he hath theſe words, <hi>Pugna commiſſa caeduntur magno numero &amp; profligantur, ad no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uem millia cecidiſſe tradit qui interfuit Philippus Cominius. Sed Brabantiae ſcriptor &amp; quidam ſcriptor Flandriae (quibus plus habeo fidei) tria tantum millia occubuiſſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi> For anſwere heereunto, if this place be indifferently weighed it ſhall appeere to be wholie grounded vpon malice and no colour of reaſon, much leſſe iuſt proofe: Firſt, bicauſe <hi>Meyer</hi> preferreth the credit of theſe obſcure Annaliſtes that write but vpon report, before the credit of him that was an eie witneſſe, and that no way could aduantage himſelfe by reporting a lye. Secondarily, ſir <hi>Oliuer de la Marche,</hi> who liued alſo in that time and was Steward of the Duke of Burgundies houſe, writeth that a great number of theſe Liegeois were ſlaine at this battell, and alſo at the ſiege of Saintron, but that their friends and kinsfolkes truſſed vp their dead bodies in veſſels full of lime; partly to the end the diſcomfiture might appeere the leſſe, and partlie that they might be buried among their aunceſtors, in the which feate (ſaith he) the Liegeois ſhewed a woonderfull audacitie and courage: whereby it ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:7649:4"/>
ſeeme a great number to haue been thus truſſed vp, by meanes whereof the dead ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered the fewer, and were reported accordingly, which deceiued diuers, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie theſe Annaliſts of Brabant and Flaunders. The like practiſe we reade of in diuers authors, &amp; of the like writeth <hi>Meyer</hi> alſo himſelfe. Laſtly, the Annales of Burgundy agree with <hi>Commines,</hi> and report the number as he doth, ſo that this anſwer I hope ſhall ſuffice for this point. Againe, in the ſame booke fol. 364. <hi>Meyer</hi> writeth thus, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur Cominius de nobili quadam foemina attrebatenſis ditionis proditrice patriae, cuius aedere non vult nomen, falſus in hoc vt in caeteris hiſtoricus.</hi> Sure if it were an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted truth that a Ladie of Artois could not ſend the King ſuch aduertiſement as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> reporteth that ſhe did: or if <hi>Meyer</hi> were <hi>Pythagoras</hi> that <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> might paſſe for proofe, the credit of <hi>Commines</hi> ſhould happilie hang in ballance: but if you reade the place in his hiſtorie, the very circumſtances will induce any indifferent man to thinke, that which is there written of this Ladie to be no lie. Againe fol. 366. <hi>Meyer</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>Hic eſt Cominius ille transfuga, gente Flandrus, qui multa de Carolo &amp; Lodouico prouinciali lingua bene ſcripſit, ſed quaedam etiam ſcripſit plane men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciter, multaque dicenda infideliter reticuit.</hi> This is ſo generall and vncertaine a charge that anſwer in truth it deſerueth none: notwithſtanding, I refer to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that ſhall reade this hiſtorie, whether <hi>Commines</hi> conceale his Maſters faults therein or not (for that is <hi>Meyers</hi> meaning in this place.) True it is that he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them not in ſuch railing barbarous termes as <hi>Meyer</hi> very vnſeemely vſeth of ſo great a Prince as King <hi>Lewis</hi> was, and is offended with <hi>Commines</hi> for not dooing the like, a thing which becommeth <hi>Meyer</hi> himſelfe very ill, and would haue become <hi>Commines</hi> much woorſe. But our author as he concealeth not his maſters faults, but laieth them open enough to the vnderſtanding of the wiſe and attentiue Reader: ſo deliuereth he them, ſo ſparingly, and vnder ſuch termes as truth being vttered, the Kings honor be no further impeached, than verie neceſſitie doth enforce; a matter verie commendable in a gentleman writing of a Prince, a ſeruant of his Maſter, and a ſubiect of his Soueraigne. Laſtly, <hi>Meyer fol.</hi> 365. hath theſe words, <hi>refert Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius exercitum Caroliadeo fuiſſe extenuatum, vt exhibere illum Anglis non auderet, ſed hoc falſum eſt.</hi> But you muſt beleeue <hi>Meyer</hi> vpon his word, other diſproofe of <hi>Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> report he can bring none, neither grounded vpon any circumſtance, nor produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of any good author that writ of thoſe times. But on the contrary ſide for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of that which <hi>Commines</hi> writeth in this place, firſt <hi>La Marche</hi> reporteth that the bloodie fluxe entered into the Dukes campe lying before Nuz, which it is verie like conſumed many, and impaired the health of many more. With him alſo agree the Annales of Burgundie, which report that the Duke loſt 15000. men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Nuz: which being well conſidered, and this withall, that the ſiege endured a whole yeere, and yet in the ende the Duke forced to depart fruſtrate of his purpoſe, whereby his ſoldiers had not onely their bodies tired, but alſo their mindes diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged: I ſuppoſe no man of ſounde iudgement will thinke that the Dukes armie could be otherwiſe than in verie poore eſtate. Now that you haue heard all that <hi>Meyer</hi> hath or can obiect againſt the credit of this hiſtorie (which alſo how ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he hath prooued I leaue to the iudgement of the wiſe and indifferent reader to conſider:) it is good reaſon you ſhould alſo heare what opinion other authors haue both of <hi>Commines</hi> and of his hiſtorie, and how honorable teſtimonie in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings they giue to them both. <hi>Annales Burgundiae lib.</hi> 3. <hi>pa.</hi> 930. ſpeaking of <hi>Commines</hi> teſtifie thus of him. <hi>He was one of the wiſeſt gentlemen of his time, and the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all matters of ſtate, as appeereth by his hiſtorie: whereof the Emperour</hi> Charles <hi>made ſo great account, that he neuer ſlept before he had read certaine chapters thereof, for the finiſhing of his daies worke.</hi> Which ſure this noble and ſage Emperor
<pb facs="tcp:7649:5"/>
would neuer haue done, if <hi>Commines</hi> had been a reporter of lies, eſpecially of the ſaid Emperours owne great grandfather, whoſe life and death are ſo amplie in this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie treated of. <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> giueth ſuch credit to <hi>Commines,</hi> that al that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the hiſtory of France of the raigne of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. is onely an abridgment of him, &amp; wholy taken out of his writings. <hi>Ferron</hi> in his ſupply to <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie maketh in many places very honorable mention of <hi>Commines,</hi> highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him both for his great wiſedome and vertue and ſinceritie in his hiſtorie. <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uico Guicciardini</hi> no French man, but an Italian, in his deſcription of the lowe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries fol. 220. calleth <hi>Commines</hi> a writer woorthie of great commendation. And fol. 310. and 311. thus he writeth. <hi>Of the Noble houſe of</hi> Commines <hi>was</hi> Philip de Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines <hi>Lord of Argenton, who wrote the hiſtorie of his owne time verie ſincerely, he was a noble perſonage, of great enterpriſe, and of him diuers authors make honorable mention.</hi> Heere we haue the true teſtimonie of ſundrie woorthie writers (for to vouche all were too tedious) on <hi>Commines</hi> behalfe, which ioined with the approbation of the noble Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, are ſufficient, as I ſuppoſe, to maintaine his credit againſt the venemous dartes of <hi>Meyers</hi> ſclanderous accuſations. Now as touching <hi>Commines</hi> life, the onely thing that <hi>Meyer</hi> blameth therein, is his departure from the Duke of Burgundies ſeruice: for the which he inueigheth no leſſe bitterly againſt his perſon, than before he did againſt his hiſtorie, for fol. 355. where he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Duke of Burgundies cruelty vſed at the caſtle of Neſle, which he tooke by aſſault the yeere 1472. he hath theſe wordes. <hi>Crudelis hic viſus Corolus &amp; animo turbato, crediturque quoſdam ex familiaribus parum habuiſſe fideles, ex quibus hand du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie er at Philippus ille Cominius or tu Flandrus, Dominus Ruſcurii, qui hoc anno transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git adregem, quiſivir fuiſſet probus &amp; integer, nequaquam deſerto Dominc ſuo, deſerta &amp; abiurata patria ad talem tranſiſſet tyrannum, alioſque ad idem faciendum ſolicitaſſet, quantiſcunque muneribus inuitatus.</hi> Againe fol. 366. thus he ſaith, <hi>Cauſam cur transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerit aliisque nonnullis author fuerit idem faciendi non lego, cum autem Cominius in ſuis ſcriptis cauſam ſuae defectionis reticeat, non dubium puto quin ob faedum aliquod patra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſcelus more proditorum aufugerit.</hi> Whereunto ſomewhat to anſwere in <hi>Commines</hi> behalfe, I ſay that what cauſe mooued him to leaue the Duke as we certainely know not, ſo is it not like that he departed from him for any heinous offence, bicauſe he was neuer charged with any, neither is <hi>Meyer</hi> able to produce any one teſtimonie (as euen himſelfe in this place is forced to confeſſe) that he forſooke the Duke in any treacherous ſort, neither is he able to prooue that he ſollicited any to leaue the Dukes ſeruice during the Dukes life, though without all proofe moſt vniuſtly he charge him therewith. For if <hi>Commines</hi> had departed with the betraying of townes and caſtles to the enimy as <hi>de Cordes</hi> did; if for attempting to deſtroie the Dukes perſon, as <hi>Baldwine</hi> the Dukes baſe brother, and the Earle of Eſtampes his coſin did; if for both, as the Earle of Campobaſſo did, his offence could no more haue beene concealed, than the others aboue mentioned was. Wherefore as <hi>Meyer</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth that bicauſe <hi>Commines</hi> no where in his writings vttereth the cauſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, it is like he departed for ſome hainous offence: ſo one the other ſide with much more reaſon it may be anſwered, that bicauſe neither <hi>Meyer</hi> nor any other Hiſtoriographer in their writings vtter the cauſe of his departure; like it is that he departed for no hainous offence, but onely for his owne aduancement or ſafetie or both, without ſeeking by traiterous practiſes to harme the Duke, as the aboue named with diuers others did. But let vs now examine what by all preſumption was the cauſe of his departure from the Duke: and ſecondarily, whether his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from one Maſter to another being in hoſtilitie be excuſable: which two points being throughly diſcuſſed, it ſhall plainly appeere to the world, whether he be iuſtly
<pb facs="tcp:7649:5"/>
to be charged with any euill dealing, for leauing the Duke of Burgundie his firſt Maſter, and vnder whoſe dominion he was borne. As touching the firſt point, I am of opinion that <hi>Commines</hi> by his departure from the Duke of Burgundie, ſought both his owne aduauncement and his ſafetie, the former whereof he had iuſt cauſe to hope for at King <hi>Lewis</hi> his hands, as a thing well deſerued, at the Kings being at Peronne, where <hi>Commines</hi> wiſedome and great credit with the Duke of Burgundie (as ſay the Annales of Burgundie) ſtood the King in ſo good ſtead, that by his onely meanes he was reſtored to his realme, libertie and life, which otherwiſe had beene in great danger, as by the courſe of this hiſtorie moſt plainly doth appeere. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Commines</hi> could not but aſſure himſelfe of great aduauncement at King <hi>Lewis</hi> his hands, as well bicauſe of the Kings great liberalitie, as alſo for his owne deſert: neither did his hope faile him, as the ſequele well declared. On the other ſide at the Dukes hands no great aduauncement was to be looked for, both bicauſe the qualitie of his ſeruice to the Duke and the King was not alike, and ſo conſequently the deſert vnlike; and alſo bicauſe the Dukes liberalitie was inferior to the Kings, his attempts ſo impoueriſhing him, that he had not to be liberall of as the King had. Whereunto I adde, that he made no ſuch account of his ſeruants as the King did, but attributed all his good ſucceſſe to his owne braine, whereby their ſeruice was the leſſe eſteemed and the woorſe rewarded, or rather not at all eſteemed nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded: for he neuer vſed any mans counſell but his owne, ſo that wiſe men loſt but their time with him. Yea <hi>Meyer</hi> himſelfe reporteth him to be <hi>Durum, aſperum &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratum, à quo milites maligne admodum ſtipendia accipiebant, raro blande &amp; liberaliter appellarentur, quanquam multis in locis extremis periculis ſe obiectarent, plurimumque algoris, inediae &amp; aeſtus ſuſtinerent.</hi> If then the Duke were of this diſpoſition towards his ſoldiers, and ſo euill rewarded them whoſe helpe he daily and howerly vſed: what reward could any wiſe man looke for at his hands, whoſe aduice he ſeldome asked and neuer followed? Further, the Duke was of nature very cholericke and ready to offer his ſeruants iniurie, as for example, to the Earle of Campobaſſo he gaue a blowe, which in the end coſt him his life, and whether any ſuch outrage offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to our Author cauſed or furthered his departure we knowe not: but that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement (which was to be looked for at the Kings hands, and not to be hoped for at the Dukes) was one cauſe, is already, as I ſuppoſe, ſufficiently prooued. The ſecond cauſe of <hi>Commines</hi> departure from the Duke in mine opinion was ſafetie; for the Duke, as <hi>Commines</hi> himſelfe reporteth, forced not to venture his ſeruants into any danger were it neuer ſo great, which all men (eſpecially deſpairing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their ſeruice) will ſeeke to auoide: for as our Author himſelfe ſaith in one place of his hiſtorie, moſt men by ſeruice ſeeke to aduaunce themſelues, but all men will haue an eie to ſaue themſelues. Further, <hi>Commines</hi> being a very wiſe man fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſawe the Dukes attempts to be ſuch, as would in the end ouerthrowe both himſelfe, his ſubiects, and his dominions, wherefore he thought it beſt to diſlodge in time and to ſaue one. Theſe in mine opinion were the principall cauſes of his departure from the Duke, which being honeſt and reaſonable, and his departure likewiſe voide of al treaſon and trecherous practiſes againſt the Duke: I ſee no reaſon why for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture he ſhould not rather be commended than condemned. The laſt point that we haue to conſider is, whether he being the Dukes ſubiect might leaue his Maſter and depart to the King, were the cauſes of his departure neuer ſo reaſonable and honeſt. Whereunto I anſwer, that <hi>Commines</hi> was not abſolutely the Dukes ſubiect: for Flaunders was held in ſoueraigntie of the crowne of Fraunce, and both the Earle and all the people ſworne to beare no armes againſt the King of Fraunce, and diuers
<pb facs="tcp:7649:6"/>
examples too long to rehearſe, are to be read in the hiſtories of diuers Earles of Flaunders that haue been arreſted, impriſoned, and togither with their people fined for breach of this oth. Wherefore ſeeing our author was a Flemming borne, and Flaunders held in Soueraigntie of the King of Fraunce, and the Duke of Burgundie in-hoſtilitie with the King of Fraunce, contrarie to the oth he either tooke or ought to haue taken; and further violating diuers, naie I may ſay all thoſe points whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by his allegeance he was bound to the French King: I ſee no reaſon why <hi>Commines</hi> might not, or rather ought not to leaue an inferior rebellious Lord, and cleaue to his ſoueraign Prince and King, to whom he ought a ſoueraign dutie both by allegeance and oth. And if after his reuolt, he gaue any aduice to the furtherance of the Kings affaires, he did therein in mine opinion the dutie of a faithfull ſeruant and true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. Thus much I haue beene forced to ſpeake in defence both of <hi>Commines</hi> life, and hiſtorie, whereof as the former appeereth to haue beene both honeſt and vertuous as well by the reaſons aboue alleaged, as alſo by the notable diſcourſes wherewith he farceth his hiſtorie, which breath nothing but vertue and ſinceritie: ſo is the latter confirmed by the conſent of diuers good hiſtories, and approoued by the iudgement of the nobleſt Princes that Europe bred theſe many hundred yeers, as I truſt is ſufficiently declared. Wherefore our authors credit ſtandeth vpright, as well for good conuerſation of life, as ſincere report in hiſtorie, both the which <hi>Meyer</hi> no leſſe falſely ſlandereth, than he doth in other places of his Annales the noble races of the Kings of England and Fraunce, which ignorantly or maliciouſlie he reporteth to be more vile and baſe than any honeſt eare can endure to heare. Thus hauing I truſt ſufficiently defended the credit of this woorthie writer, I will heere abruptly for auoiding of tediouſnes ſtaie my pen.</p>

               <head>THE PREFACE OF THE AVTHOR TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF VIENNA in Fraunce.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O ſatisfie your requeſt ſo often mooued vnto me (right reuerend father in God) I ſend you heere a memoriall as agreeable to truth, as I can poſſibly call to minde, of all the acts and doings that I haue been priuy vnto, of king <hi>Levvis</hi> the eleuenth our maſter and benefactor, and a prince woorthy of perpetuall memory. Of his youth I can ſay nothing but by his owne report. But from the time I entred into his ſeruice, till the hower of his death whereat I was preſent, I was more continually reſident with him than any man of my eſtate that ſerued him, being euer either of his priuy chamber, or employed in his weightie affaires. I found in him as in all other princes that I haue knowne or ſerued both good and bad. For men they are as we be, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is proper to God onely. But ſure that prince whoſe vertues and good parts ſurmount his vices, deſerueth great commendation, the rather bicauſe commonly noble perſonages are more prone to al kind of wantonnes than other men: partly for that in their childhood they are brought vp without due chaſtiſement &amp; correction, &amp; partly bicauſe when they are grown to mans eſtate, ech man ſeeketh to ſeed their humors &amp; ſooth them in all they ſay or do. But for mine own part bicauſe I loue not to flatter nor miſreport the truth, ſomwhat may happily be found in this hiſtorie not tending altogither to the kings praiſe, but I truſt the readers will weigh the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aboue alledged. Sure thus much I dare boldly ſay in his commendation, that in mine opinion he was the prince in his age (all things conſidered) leaſt ſubiect to vice. Yet haue I knowne and been conuerſant with as many great princes, both ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and temporall as any man in Fraunce of my time, as well the princes of this realme, as thoſe alſo that haue liued in Britaine, Flaunders, Almayne, Englande, Spayne, Portugall, and Italy. Diuers others alſo whom I haue not ſeene: yet haue I knowne, partly by conference with their ambaſſadors, and partly by their letters and inſtructions which are meanes ſufficient to enforme men of their natures and inclinations. Notwithſtanding I minde not by ſetting foorth his commendation in this worke, to detract from the honor and good renowne of others, but ſend you, penned in haſte all that I could call to minde, truſting that you haue required it of me to turne it into ſome worke that you purpoſe to publiſh in Latine (to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of which toong you haue atteined) whereby may appeere both the woorthines of the prince I now write of, and alſo the excellencie of your owne wit. Farther ſir, if I happen to faile in any point, you haue my L. of Bouchage, and others who are better able to enforme you of theſe affaires than my ſelfe, and to couch their words in much eloquenter language. Although to ſay the truth conſidering how honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie the king entertained me, how great familiaritie it pleaſed him to vſe towards me, and how liberally he beſtowed vpon me, neuer intermitting one of the three till the houre of his death, no man hath iuſter cauſe to remember thoſe times then my ſelfe, whereunto I alſo adde the loſſes I haue ſuſteined, and dangers I haue been in ſithence his deceaſe, which are ſufficient I thinke, to put me in minde of the great benefits I receiued at his hands during his life. Notwithſtanding that I know it to be a matter of courſe that after the death of great and mightie princes, great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7649:10"/>
enſue to the loſſe of ſome, and gain of others: for riches and honors folow not alwaies their expectation that hunt after them. To conclude ſir, the better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you of the time ſithence I entred into the kings familiarity (which is your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) I am forced firſt to rehearſe what hapned before I came to his ſeruice, and ſo orderly to proceede from the time I became his ſeruant, till the houre of his death.</p>

But notwithſtanding quoth he, that I my ſelfe neuer were ſuſpicious: yet if I had bin in my ſonnes place at the ſame time, that this baſtard of Rubempre haunted thoſe coaſts: I would ſure haue cauſed him to be apprehended as my ſonne did. Laſtly, he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7649:10"/>
promiſed that if this baſtard were not guiltie of this fact, to waite a purpoſe to haue taken his ſonne (as common report ſaid he was) he would foorthwith deliuer him out of priſon, and ſende him to the King according to his ambaſſadors demands? The D. anſwer ended: <hi>Moruillier</hi> began againe, charging with great and heinous offences, <hi>Frances</hi> D. of Britaine, and alledging that at the Earle of Charolois late being at Tours (whither he went to viſit the king) the ſaid D. and he had giuen their faith ech to other in writing to become brethren in armes, which writings he ſaid were enterchangeablie deliuered by the hands of maſter <hi>Tanneguy du Chastel,</hi> who ſince hath been gouernor of Rouſſillon, and borne ſome ſwaie in this realme: This fact <hi>Moruillier</hi> aggrauated in ſuch ſort, that nothing he omitted in ſetting foorth this offence that might tend to the diſgrace and diſhonor of a Prince. Whereunto the Earle of Charolois made offer eftſoones to anſwere, being maruellouſly out of patience to heare ſuch reprochfull ſpeeches vſed of his friend and confederate. But <hi>Moruillier</hi> euer cut him off ſaying: My Lord of Charolois, I am not come of ambaſſage to you but to my L. your Father. The ſaid Earle beſought his father diuers times to giue him leaue to anſwer, who in the end ſaid thus vnto him: I haue anſwered for thee as me thinketh, the father ſhould anſwer for the ſonne, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding if thou haue ſo great deſire to ſpeake, bethinke thy ſelfe to day, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſpeake and ſpare not. Then <hi>Moruillier</hi> to his former ſpeech added, that he could not imagine what had mooued the Earle to enter into this league with the D. of Britaine, vnleſſe it were bicauſe of a penſion <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP1.NOTE8">

               <p>The next day in preſence of the ſelfe ſame audience, the Earle of Charolois kneeling vpon a veluetcuſhion, directed his ſpeech to his father, and began with this baſtard of <hi>Rubempre,</hi> affirming the cauſes of his impriſonment to be iuſt &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as the courſe of his arraignment ſhould well declare. Notwithſtanding I thinke nothing was euer prooued againſt him, though I confeſſe the preſumptions to haue been great. Fiue yeeres after I my ſelfe ſaw him deliuered out of priſon. This point thus anſwered, the Earle began to diſcharge the D. of Britaine and himſelfe, ſaying, that true it was that the D. and he were entred into league and amitie, &amp; had ſworn themſelues brethren in armes, but that this league tended in no reſpect to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of the King or his realme, but rather to the ſeruice and defence thereof, if neede ſhould ſo require. Laſtly, as touching the penſion taken from him, he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he neuer receiued but one quarters benefit thereof, to the value of nine thouſand francks <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP1.NOTE9">

I thinke verily, had it not been for the reuerence he bare to his ſaid father who was there preſent, and to whom he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed his ſpeech, that he would haue vſed much bitterer termes. In the end D. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> very wiſely and humbly beſought the King lightly not to conceiue an euill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him or his ſonne, but to continue his fauor towards them. Then the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet was brought in, and the ambaſſadors tooke their leaue both of the father and the ſonne. But after the Earle of Eu, and the Chauncellor had taken their leaue of the Earle of Charolois, who ſtood a good way from his father, he ſaid thus to the Archbiſhop of Narbonne that paſſed forth the laſt of the ambaſſadors: Remember my moſt humble dutie to the King, and tell him he hath made his Chauncellor to vſe me very homely heere, but before a yeeres end he ſhall repent it: which meſſage the Archbiſhop did to the King at his returne into Fraunce as heereafter you ſhall perceiue.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Oone after the abouenamed Ambaſſadors departure, <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Bourbon that laſt died, arriued at the town of Liſle, pretending that he came to viſit his vncle Duke <hi>Philip</hi> of Burgundie, who aboue all houſes loued eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally this houſe of Bourbon, and no maruell: for this Duke of Bourbons mother was Duke <hi>Philips</hi> ſiſter. She had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a widow many yeeres, and ſoiourned there at that time with hir brother, both hir ſelfe and diuers of hir children, to wit, three daughters and one ſonne, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this was not indeed the cauſe of the Duke of Bourbons arriuall, but his comming was to perſwade the Duke of Burgundie to ſuffer an armie to be leuied in his dominions, aſſuring him that all the Princes of Fraunce would do the like: meaning thereby to giue the King to vnderſtand how euill and vniuſt gouernment he vſed in his realme, &amp; purpoſing to make themſelues ſo ſtrong, that they might conſtraine him by force to redreſſe this inconuenience, if praiers could not preuaile. This war was afterward called THE WEALE PVBLIQVE, bicauſe the authors thereof vſed the common wealth for colour of their enterpriſe. The ſaid good Duke <hi>Philip</hi> (for ſo is he ſurnamed ſince his death) agreed that an armie ſhould be leuied in his dominions, but the bottom of the enterpriſe was neuer diſcouered to him: for he thought not that the matter ſhoulde haue come to hand ſtrokes as after it did. Immediately began the muſters through all the Dukes domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the Earle of Saint Paule afterward Conſtable of Fraunce, accompanied with the Marſhall of Burgundie, being of the houſe of Neuf-chaſtell, repaired to Cambray (where D. <hi>Philip</hi> then lay) to the Earle of Charolois, who immediatly after their arriuall aſſembled his fathers Councill, and a great number of his ſubiects in the Biſhops palace at Cambray, where he proclaimed all the houſe of Croy traitors to his father and him. And notwithſtanding that the Earle of S.

All this trouble hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his houſe bicauſe of the reſtitution of the territories aboue mentioned, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate vpon the riuer of Somme, which the Duke had reſtored to King <hi>Lewis</hi> for the ſum of 400000. crownes, by the perſwaſion of this houſe of Croy, as the Earle of Charolois laide to their charge.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Earle after he had pacified his father, and reconciled himſelfe to him the beſt that mought be, put his whole force incontinent into the field, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

with the Earle of S.

Like bands and as great were alſo vnder the leading of the L. of Rauaſtin the D. of Cleues brother, and the L. <hi>Anthony</hi> baſtard of Burgundie, other captaines for breuitie I paſſe ouer, but aboue all the reſt, two knights there were eſpecially, in great credit with the Earle of Charolois, the one named the L. of Hault-bordin an ancient knight, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard brother to the Earle of S.

They had both been trained vp in the long wars betweene Fraunce and England, at the ſame time that <hi>Henry</hi> the 5. of that name King of England, raigned in Fraunce, being confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with this Duke <hi>Philip</hi> of Burgundie. They were two valiant and wiſe knights, and had the principall charge of the whole armie of yoong gentlemen: there were a number, but one eſpecially very famous, called maſter <hi>Philip</hi> of Lalain, iſſued of a race that hath euer been ſo valiant and couragious, that they haue in maner all died in the wars in their princes ſeruice. The Earles force was great: for his men of armes were to the number of 1400. but euill armed, and vntrained, bicauſe of the long peace theſe Princes of Burgundie had liued in.

The poore people of the citie were in ſo great feare the day of the skirmiſh, that they cried often (as I was afterwards credibly enformed) that we were entred the towne, but without cauſe. Notwithſtanding the L. of Hault-bourdin aboue mentioned (who had been brought vp in the towne, when it was nothing ſo ſtrong as now it is) gaue aduiſe to aſſault it, and the ſoldiers deſired nothing more, contemning the townes men bicauſe the skirmiſhes were hard at their gates, yet the contrary opinion tooke place, whereupon the Earle retired to S.

               <p>The Vicechauncellor of Britaine called <hi>Rouuille</hi> was yet in the Earle of Charo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois campe, and with him an ancient man of armes named <hi>Maderey,</hi> the ſelfeſame that deliuered Pont S.

Wherefore they were both in great feare, and fled before the two armies ioined, taking the way to the Britaines campe. The Earle of Charolois company ſet themſelues in order of battell as they marched, and at their arriuall found the Earle of S. Paul on foot, &amp; all the archers diſmounted, ech man hauing a pale pitched before him. Farther, they beat out the heads of diuers pipes of wine to drink: &amp; ſure for thoſe few battels I haue been in, I neuer ſaw men in my life more deſirous to fight, which me thought was a good ſigne and a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Order was giuen at the firſt that we ſhould all light on foote none excepted, but that order was afterward altered.

For when God ment to withdraw his goodnes from the Engliſh men, this wiſe King died at Bois de Vincennes, and his ſonne who prooued but a ſimple man, was crowned King of Fraunce and England at Paris.

The Kings army ſtood neere to the caſtle of Montl'hery, a great hedge and a ditch being betweene them and vs. The fields beyond them bare that yeere wheate, beanes, and other graine, growne maruellous high and thicke: for the ſoile there is verie good. All the Earles ſhot marched on foote before him in very euill order, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that in mine opinion in a battel the principall hope of victorie conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the ſhot, I meane if the force of ſhot be great (for ſmall force ſerueth to ſmall purpoſe) and either euill mounted (to the end they be not vnwilling to forſake their horſes) or not mounted at all. Farther the day of a battle, thoſe that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the wars will do a greater exploit, than thoſe that haue been long trained vp therein, this is the Engliſhmens opinion, who are beſt ſhot in the world: order was firſt giuen (as you haue heard) that the Earles battle ſhould reſt twiſe vpon the way, to the end the foote men mought breath them, bicauſe the vaward and it were far aſunder, and the corne high and thicke which troubled their going, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the cleane contrarie was done, as though men would purpoſely haue loſt all. Wherfore heerby, God manifeſtly declared that he is the Lord of hoſtes, and diſpoſeth of the victorie as ſeemeth beſt to him, and ſure for my part, I cannot be perſwaded that the wiſdome of one man is ſufficient to gouerne ſuch a number of men, nor that an enterpriſe can be executed in the field, as it is deuiſed in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and farther I verily beleeue, that who ſo ableth himſelfe by his own wit and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie to giue order in ſo waightie a matter, misbehaueth himſelfe towards God. Notwithſtanding euery man ought to do his endeuour therein, acknowledging the wars to be one of the accompliſhments of Gods iudgements, which oftentimes he beginneth vpon ſmall occaſions, to the end that by giuing victorie now to one, and now to another, ſome great realmes and ſeniories may fall to ruine and deſolation, and other ſome increaſe and floriſh with large empire and dominion, for farther proofe whereof marke this that foloweth. The Earle of Charolois marched with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any breathing giuen to his ſhot and footemen vpon the way. The Kings men of armes paſſed through the hedge aboue mentioned at two ſeuerall places, and when they approched ſo neere their enimies, that they began to charge their ſtaues, the Burgundian men of armes brake their owne ſhot, and paſſed through it, not giuing them leaue to let one arrow flie, notwithſtanding that the ſhot were the principall force and onely hope of their armie, for of the men of armes (being to the number of twelue hundred) I thinke hardly fifty knew how to charge a launce, there were not foure hundred of them armed with quiracies, and of their retinue not one armed, all the which inconueniences grew partly bicauſe they had reſted ſo long in peace, and partly bicauſe this houſe of Burgundie for eaſe of their ſubiects, entertained no ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in ordinarie. But ſince that day, theſe Seniors of Burgundie haue continued in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7649:16"/>
troubles, which euen at this preſent rather increaſe than diminiſh. Thus the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundian men of armes (as you haue heard) brake themſelues the chiefe force and onely hope of their armie, yet notwithſtanding, ſo it pleaſed God to diſpoſe of this matter, that on the right ſide of the caſtle, where the Earle himſelfe ſtoode no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was found. All this day I my ſelfe neuer departed from the Earle, being leſſe afraide than in any other battell that euer I was at ſince, for I was yoong and knew not what perill ment, but wondred how any man durſt reſiſt the Prince I ſerued, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing none to be comparable to him. Such are the cogitations of men lacking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which cauſeth them oftentimes to maintaine fond arguments, grounded vpon ſmall reaſon. Wherefore it is good to follow his aduiſe that ſaith, A man ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome repenteth him of too little ſpeech, but often of too much. On the lefthand ſtood the Lord of Rauaſtin, and maſter <hi>Iames</hi> of S. Paul, with diuers others, who well perceiued their force too weake to encounter with the enimie that came to charge them, but they were now ſo neere ioined togither, that it was too late to deuiſe any new order. To be ſhort, theſe were vtterly ouerthrowne, and perſued euen hard to our carriage, where certaine of the footemen relied themſelues, but the greateſt part tooke the forreſt, being but halfe a league thence. The principall that folowed the chaſe were the gentlemen of Daulphine and Sauoy, with certeine companies of men of armes, who ſuppoſed the victorie to haue been theirs, and not without cauſe, for ſure the Burgundians flight was great on that ſide, yea and of great perſonages. The moſt part fled toward Pont S. Maxence, <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP3.NOTE12">

               <head>Of the danger the Earle of Charolois was in, and how he was reſcued. Chap. 4.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Earle of Charolois purſued his enimies on that ſide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſtood, halfe a league beyond Montl'hery, and found no reſiſtance, notwithſtanding that he were but ſlenderly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied and met with maine enimies, wherefore he held the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie for his: but ſuddenly an old gentleman of Luxembourg called <hi>Anthony le Breton,</hi> came to him and aduertiſed him that the French were relied vpon the field, ſo that if he followed the chaſe any further, he ſhould caſt away himſelfe. But the Earle regarded not his ſpeech, notwithſtanding that he repeated it twiſe or thriſe. But euen in that inſtant arriued Monſeur de Contay, who told him the ſelfeſame tale the old gentleman of Luxembourg had done, and that in ſo ſtout and bold termes, that he gaue credit to his words and experience, and preſently returned. And I thinke verily if he had paſſed but two bow ſhot farther, he had been taken as diuers were that followed the chaſe before him. As he returned, hard by the village he met with a band of footemen flying, whom he purſued being accompanied hardly with an hundred horſe: none of theſe footemen made reſiſtance but one, who gaue the Earle ſuch a blowe on the breſt with a iauelin, that the marke thereof appeered at night: the greateſt part of the reſt eſcaped through the gardens, but he that ſtrake the Earle was ſlaine. And as we paſſed hard by the caſtell, we found the archers of the Kings garde before the gate, who neuer abandoned their place for our comming: whereat the Earle much maruelled, for he thought the battell had beene at an end, but he found it otherwiſe: for as he turned about to enter into the field (part of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie being ſcattered from him) ſuddenly 15. or 16. men of armes gaue a charge vpon him, and at the very firſt ſlue his caruer named <hi>Philip D'orgues</hi> bearing a gydon of his armes. The Earle was there in great danger and receiued many hurts, eſpecially one in the throte with a ſword (the marke whereof ſtack by him as long as he liued) by reaſon that his beauer being euill faſtened in the morning was fallen away, and I my ſelfe ſaw when it fell. The enimies laid hands vpon him, ſaying, My Lord yeeld, we know you well ynough, be not wilfully ſlaine: but he manfully defended himſelfe. And at that inſtant a phyſitions ſonne of Paris that ſerued the Earle, named <hi>Iohn Cadet</hi> being a great lubberly fellow, mounted vpon a ſtrong iade like himſelfe, ran through the enimies, and brake them <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP4.NOTE1">

                  </ref>, wherewith they retired to the ditch ſide, (the place they had taken in the morning) the rather for that they diſcouered one of our enſignes marching in the midſt of the field, and approching neere to vs, being the baſtard of Burgundies enſigne, all to totterd and torne, to the which the Earle all embrewed in his owne blood retired, leauing at his archers enſigne not aboue fortie men, with whom we being hardly thirtie, ioined in great feare. The Earle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7649:17"/>
changed his horſe, hauing a freſh horſe brought him by <hi>Symon</hi> of Quingy then his page, and ſince a man well knowne: and rode about the field to relie his men, leauing vs that taried behinde him in ſuch feare, that by the ſpace of an houre we were all fully reſolued to flie, if but a hundred enimies had marched againſt vs: notwithſtanding our men came to vs by ten and twentie in a troupe, as well horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as footemen, but of the footemen many were hurt, and all very wearie, partly bicauſe of the battell, and partly bicauſe of their vnreaſonable iourney in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Soone after returned the Earle himſelfe, hardly accompanied with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, but by litle and litle our number increaſed. The corne which but halfe an houre before had been ſo high, was now troden flat downe, by meanes whereof, aroſe a terrible duſt, all the fields lay ſtrawed with dead bodies of men an horſes, but bicauſe of the duſt none could be knowne.</p>
               <p>Immediately after this, we diſcouered the Earle of S. Paul iſſuing out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, accompanied with fortie men of armes, and his enſigne marched ſtraight tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards vs, and continually increaſed in number, but bicauſe he was far from vs, we ſent twiſe or thriſe to him deſiring him to make haſte, which notwithſtanding he did not, neither altred his pace, but cauſed his men to take vp the launces that lay vpon the ground, and came in very good order, which ſight much comforted vs. With him a great number relied themſelues, and in the end came and ioined with vs, ſo that we were then to the number of eight hundred men of armes, but footemen fewe or none, which was the onely let the Earle obteined not perfect victory, for there was a great ditch and a thicke hedge betweene his battell and the Kings.</p>
               <p>Of the Kings part fled the Earle of Maine with diuers others, to the number of eight hundred men of armes. Some haue helde opinion that the ſaid Earle of Maine had intelligence with the Burgundians, but for mine owne part I beleeue it not. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was in any battell ſo great flight on both ſides, but the two Princes kept the field: of the Kings part there was a man of honor that fled as far as Luzignan without ſtaie, and of the Earles part a noble perſonage to <hi>Queſnoy le Comte,</hi> theſe two had no great deſire to bite one another <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP4.NOTE2">

                  </ref>.</p>
               <p>While the two armies ſtood thus in order of battell, the one in face of the other, the artillerie ſhot terribly, which ſlue men on both ſides, but neither partie deſired a new field. Notwithſtanding our band was greater then the Kings, but his preſence and the curteous language he vſed to his ſoldiers, was a great ſtay to his people, ſo far foorth, that I am throughly perſwaded both by mine owne knowledge and that I haue ſince heard, that had it not been for him alone they had all fled. Some of our company deſired a new battell, eſpecially the L. of Haultbourdin, alledging that he diſcouered a troupe of our enimies flying, and vndoubtedly if he could haue recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but a hundred archers to haue ſhot through the hedge aboue mentioned, all had been ours.</p>
               <p>While this matter was in communication, and both the armies ſtanding thus in order of battell without fight, the night approched, and the King retired to Corbeil, but we thought he had encamped in the field, bicauſe fire falling by chance into a barrell of powder, and certaine carts laden with munition in the place where the King had ſtoode, tooke in the end the great hedge aboue mentioned, which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to haue been the French mens fiers there encamped, whereupon the Earle of S. Paul and the Lord of Haultbourdin, who ſeemed to be the men of greateſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in our army, commanded our cariage to be brought to the place where we were, and our campe to be encloſed therewith, and ſo it was. And as we ſtood there relied togither in order of battell, diuers French men returnng from the chaſe, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7649:17"/>
ſuppoſing the victory to be theirs, and our campe the Kings, paſſed through the midſt of vs, ſome of them eſcaped, but the moſt were ſlaine. The men of name that died on the Kings part were theſe, maſter <hi>Geffrey</hi> of S. Belin, the high Seneſchall of Normandy, and captaine <hi>Floquet,</hi> and of the Burgundians, maſter <hi>Philip</hi> of Lalain: of footemen and common ſoldiers we loſt more than the King, but of horſemen the King more than we: of priſoners the French tooke the beſt of thoſe that fled. There were ſlaine of both ſides two thouſand at the leaſt <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP4.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>. The field was well fought, and there were of both parties that did their endeuor, ſome in fighting, and ſome in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but ſure in mine opinion it was a woorthy feat of armes to relie themſelues togither vpon the field, and to ſtand three or foure houers in order of battell, the one in face of the other, and vndoubtedly both the Princes had good cauſe to make account of their ſubiects that ſtood ſo well by them at their need. But they did heerin like men not like angels, for ſome loſt their offices for flying, which were beſtowed vpon others that fled ten leagues beyond them: one of our part loſt his credit, and was commanded out of his maſters preſence, but within one month he was in greater fauor than before.</p>
               <p>When we were incloſed with our cariage, euery man lodged himſelfe as commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly as he could, a great number of vs were hurt, and the whole armie almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, fearing that the Pariſians with two hundred men of armes that were within the citie, and the Marſhall <hi>Ioachin</hi> the Kings lieutenant there would iſſue foorth and aſſaile vs on the other ſide. After it was darke night fiftie launces were commanded to go foorth to vnderſtand where the King lodged, but hardly twenty of them went, notwithſtanding that our campe were not aboue three bowe ſhot from the place where we ſuppoſed the King had encamped. In the meane time the Earle of Charolois ate and dranke a little, as did all the reſt of the company, each man in his owne lodging, and the wound in his necke was dreſſed: but we were forced to remooue out of the place where he refreſhed himſelfe, three or fower dead bodies to make him roome, and to bring two bottles of ſtraw, vpon the which he ſat downe. And as they remooued theſe dead bodies, one of the poore naked ſoules began to call for drinke, into whoſe mouth was powred a little of the tyſan the Earle had drunke of, wherewith his ſpirits reuiued, and then he was knowen to be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Earles garde named <hi>Sauaric</hi> a valiant fellow, and he was dreſſed and healed.</p>
               <p>The Earle debated with his Councill what was to be done, the firſt that ſpake was the Earle of Saint Paule, who ſaid we ſtood in great danger, and gaue aduiſe by breake of day to retire homeward, to burne part of our cariage, to ſaue onely the artillerie, and to giue order that none ſhould lead backe any cariage, but ſuch as had aboue ten launces vnder their charge, adding that it was impoſſible to lie there without victuals between Paris and the King. After him ſpake Mounſeur de Hault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourdin almoſt to the ſame effect, ſaue that he aduiſed vs to ſtay till we vnderſtood what newes our ſcoutes that were abroad would bring vs, to the which purpoſe ſpake alſo three or fower others. But the laſt that ſpake was Mounſeur de Contay, who ſaid that ſo ſoone as the armie ſhould vnderſtand of this reſolution rhey would al flie, and by that means be taken and ſpoiled before they had gone twenty leagues: which his opinion he confirmed by diuers very good reaſons. Wherefore he gaue aduiſe that euery man ſhould lodge himſelfe as commodiouſly as he could that night, and the next morning by breake of day begin a new field with determination either to liue or die vpon the place, which he ſaid to be a ſafer courſe than to flie. The Earle of Charolois followed the ſaid <hi>Contaies</hi> aduiſe, and gaue euery man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7649:18"/>
to take his reſt for two howers, and at the ſound of the trumpet to be in a readines: farther he willed diuers by name to ſend to comfort his ſoldiers.</p>
               <p>About midnight our ſcoutes that were abroad returned, and it well appeered they had not beene far: for they brought word that the King lodged at the fires aboue mentioned. Incontinent others were ſent foorth, and within an hower after euery man put himſelfe in a readines to fight, but the moſt part had rather haue fled. About breake of day our ſcoutes laſt ſent foorh met one of our Carters whom the enimies had taken priſoner that morning as he brought a pot of wine from Montl'hery. This Carter told them that the French were all fled, whereof they ſent word incontinent to the campe, and went themſelues to the place, and found the Carters report true, whereupon they returned with this newes to the great comfort of the whole armie, and then a number cried to purſue them, that made but ſmall haſte after them. Not an hower before my ſelfe had an old horſe halfe tired, who by chaunce thruſt his head into a paile of wine and drunke it off, which made him luſtier and freſher that day than euer before.</p>
               <p>When it was broad day euery man mounted on horſeback, and the ſquadrons made a goodly ſhew in the field, notwithſtanding all our companies were not yet come togither, but a number returned at that preſent which had lien hidden in the woods all night. The Earle of Charolois ſuborned a Frier Franciſcan, who brought worde to the campe that he came from the Britains, who would be there the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame day, which newes comforted not a little the whole armie, but all men beleeued it not.</p>
               <p>Immediately after, to wit, about ten of the clocke in the morning, arriued the Vicechancellor of Britaine, called <hi>Rouuille,</hi> and <hi>Maderey</hi> aboue mentioned with him, accompanied with two archers of the D. of Britaines garde in their liuery coates, which comforted maruellouſly the whole army, and the ſaid Vicechancellor was asked where he had been, and was commended for his departure (conſidering the great murmuring that was riſen againſt him) but much more for his returne, and euery man welcomed them and made them good cheere.</p>
               <p>All this day the Earle of Charolois kept ſtill the field, reioicing greatly and wholy attributing the honor of the victory to himſelfe alone, which glory coſt him deere, for after this he neuer followed any mans deuiſe but his owne, and whereas before he had hated the wars, and loued nothing that appertained thereunto: his thoughts were after this ſo cleane altred that he continued in the wars till his death, in them ended his life, &amp; by them deſolated his houſe, at the leaſt brought it maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly vnderfoote, though not altogither deſtroied it. Three noble and wiſe Princes his predeceſſors had ſo highly aduanced it, that few Kings except the K. of Fraunce were mightier than he, and in rich and ſtrong townes none paſſed him: but no man, eſpecially no Prince ought to attribute too much to himſelfe, but to acknowledge all proſperitie and good ſucceſſe to proceed from God. Sure theſe two things I dare boldly ſay in his commendation, firſt that I thinke neuer man endured more trauell than he in all points of bodily labour and exerciſe, and ſecondarily that in mine opinion, I neuer knew hardier gentleman: for I neuer heard him complaine of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, I neuer ſaw him ſhew any countenance of feare, yet was I with him ſeuen yeeres togither in the wars: euery ſommer without faile, and ſomtime both winter and ſommer his attempts and enterpriſes were ſo high and difficult, that onely God by his abſolute power could haue atchiued them, for they paſſed far mans reach.</p>

The caſtell helde for the King, and was not aſſaulted by vs. The third day being paſſed, the Earle of Charalois by the Lord of Contais aduiſe departed to Eſtampes (a good and commodious lodging, and a fruitfull ſoile) meaning to preuent the Britains, who came that way, and before their ariuall to lodge his men that were ſicke and hurt in the towne, and the reſt abroad in the fields.

At the ſaid town of Eſtampes arriued the Lord <hi>Charles</hi> of Fraunce then Duke of Berry, and the Kings onely brother, accompanied with the Duke of Britaine, the Earle of Dunois, the Lord of Dampmartin, the Lord of Loheac, the L. of Beueil, the Lord of Chaumount, and maſter <hi>Charles</hi> of Amboiſe his ſonne (who ſince hath caried great credit in this realme) all the which the King at his firſt comming to the crown had diſplaced and put out of office, notwithſtanding the great ſeruices they had done the King his father and the realme, both in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Normandie and in diuers other wars. The Earle of Charolois and all the noble men that were with him went foorth to receiue them, and lodged their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the towne, where their lodgings were already made, but their forces lay abroad in the fields. They had with them eight hundred men of armes very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, a great number of the which were Britons, who lately had forſaken the Kings pay, and theſe made a gallant ſhew in their campe: of archers and other ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers armed with good Brigandines they had great force, ſo that I ſuppoſe they were ſix thouſand men on horſebacke, all in very good order, and ſure this army ſhewed the Duke of Britaine to be a great Prince, for they were all paid out of his coffer <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP5.NOTE1">

               <p>The King being retired to Corbeil (as you haue heard) was not idle, neither forgat what he had to do, but went ſtraight into Normandy partly to leuy men, and partly bicauſe he feared rebellion in the countrey, but a great part of his forces he left about Paris in thoſe places that had moſt need of defence.</p>
               <p>The firſt euening that all theſe Princes met at Eſtamps, they told newes each to other, the Britons had taken priſoners certaine of the Kings part that fled, and if
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7649:19"/>
they had been but a litle neerer the place of the battell, they had either taken or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited the third part of his army. They had firſt giuen order to ſende foorth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bands before them, to vnderſtand how neere the Kings army and the Earles were togither, but they altered their mindes. Notwithſtanding maſter <hi>Charles</hi> of Amboiſe and certiane with him ſcoured the countrey before their army, to ſee if they could meete any of their enimies, and certaine priſoners as you haue heard they tooke, and part alſo of the Kings artillerie. Theſe priſoners made report vnto them, that vndoubtedly the King was ſlaine (for ſo they ſuppoſed bicauſe they fled at the very beginning of the battell,) which newes the abouenamed maſter <hi>Charles</hi> of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe and they that were with him brought to the Britaines campe, who reioiced maruellouſly thereat, ſuppoſing it had been true, and hoping for great rewards if the Lord <hi>Charles</hi> were King. Further they debated in councell (as a man of credit there preſent, afterward aduertiſed me) how they might rid the countrey of the Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and ſend them home in the diuels name, and were in maner all agreed to cut their throtes if they could, but this their ioy ſoone ended, wherby you may perceaue what ſodaine alterations are in a realme in ſuch troubles.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the campe lying at Eſtampes, when euery man had ſupped and a great number being walking in the ſtreetes: The Lord <hi>Charles</hi> of Fraunce, and the Earle of Charolois withdrew themſelues to a window, where they entred into very earneſt communication. Now you ſhall vnderſtand that there was among the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines one that tooke great pleaſure in throwing ſquibs into the aire, which when they fall to the ground run flaming among men, his name was maſter <hi>Iohn Boutefeu,</hi> or maſter <hi>Iohn de Serpens,</hi> I wot not well whether. This mery companion being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly hidden in a houſe, threw two or three ſquibs into the aire from a high place where he ſtood, one of the which by chance ſtrake againſt the bar of the window where theſe two Princes communed togither, wherewithall both of them ſtarted ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly vp, being aſtoniſhed at this accident, and each beholding other, ſuſpecting this to be purpoſely done to hurt them: then came the Lord of Contay to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Earle of Charolois, and after he had told him a word or two in his eare, went downe, and cauſed all the men of armes of the Earles houſe, and all the archers of his garde, and a number of other to arme themſelues. Incontinent alſo the Earle of Charolois mooued the Duke of Berry to command the archers of his garde to do the like, whereupon immediatly two or three hundred men of armes, ſtood on foote in harneis before the gate, with a great number of archers, the which ſought round about from whence this fire might come: in the end the poore fellow that had done the deed fell downe vpon his knees before them confeſſing the fact, and threw three or foure other ſquibs into the aire, whereby he put diuers out of ſuſpicion each of other, thus the matter turned to a ieſt, and euery man vnarmed himſelfe and went to bed. The next day in the morning they ſat in councell to debate what was to be done, all the Princes with their principall ſeruants being there preſent, and as they were of diuers parts and not obedient to one head: ſo were they alſo of diuers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as in ſuch aſſemblies it cannot be otherwiſe choſen. But among the reſt of their talke, certaine words that paſſed the Duke of Berry (who was yoong and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with ſuch exploits) were eſpecially marked: for he ſeemed already to be weary of this enterpriſe, alledging the great number of the Earle of Charolois men that he had ſeene in the towne hurt and maimed, of whom to ſhew that he had pitie and compaſſion he brake foorth into this ſpeech and ſaid, that he had rather the matter had neuer been begun, than that ſo much miſchiefe ſhould ariſe by his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and for his cauſe, which words diſpleaſed greatly the Earle of Charolois
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7649:19"/>
and his men as heerafter you ſhall heare: Notwithſtanding they concluded in this aſſembly to go before Paris, to prooue whether the towne would enter into league with them for the benefit of the common wealth (which they al pretended to be the onely cauſe of their aſſembly) being fully perſwaded that all the townes in the realm would follow the example thereof. The words aboue mentioned vttered by the D. of Berry in this aſſembly, put the Earle of Charolois and his men into ſuch a dumpe, that they ſaid thus one to another, heard you this man ſpeake? he is diſcouraged for ſeuen or eight hundred hurt perſons that he ſeeth in the towne, who are none of his but meer ſtrangers to him, he would be otherwiſe troubled than if the matter ſhould touch himſelfe in any point, and eaſely be won to agree with his brother and leaue vs in the mire, and bicauſe of the long wars that haue been in times paſt betweene King <hi>Charles</hi> his father and the D. of Burgundie my father, both the parties would ſoone conſent to turne their forces againſt vs, wherefore it is good to prouide vs of friends in time. And vpon this ſuſpicion onely, <hi>VVilliam</hi> of Cluny Prenotarie, who died Biſhop of Poictiers was ſent to England to King <hi>Edward</hi> the 4. then raigning, to whom the Earle of Charolois had euer before been mortall enimie, ſupporting the houſe of Lancaſter againſt him, of the which he was iſſued by his mother <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP5.NOTE2">

And notwithſtanding that he ment nothing leſſe then the accompliſhment thereof, bicauſe as feruently as he loued the houſe of Lancaſter, as extreemly hated he the houſe of Yorke: yet was the matter ſo labored, that many yeeres after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was accompliſhed <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP5.NOTE3">

The Earle of Dunois accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him riding in a litter, for bicauſe of the goute he could not ſit on horſebacke, notwithſtanding his enſigne was borne with him. When they came to the riuer they launched foorth the boates they brought with them, and tooke an Iland in the midſt of the ſtreame, where certaine of our archers landed and skirmiſhed with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of horſemen that defended the paſſage on the other ſide vnder the leading of the Marſhall <hi>Ioachin</hi> and <hi>Sallezard.</hi> The place was much to their diſaduantage, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was high and in a goodly vine country, beſides that the Burgundians had great ſtore of artillerie vnder the charge of a notable gunner named Maſter <hi>Girald,</hi> whom they tooke priſoner at the battell of Montl'hery, being then in the Kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. To be ſhort, the aboue mentioned horſemen were forced to abandon the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and retire to Paris. The ſelfeſame night the bridge was made from the ſide of the riuer where we lay to the Iland, where incontinent the Earle of Charolois cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his pauilion to be pitched, and lodged there all night with fiftie men of armes of his houſe: by day breake a great number of Coopers were ſet on work to make casks of the pipe boord we brought with vs, who ſo beſtirred themſelues, that before noon the bridge was made from the Iland to the other ſide of the riuer. Incontinent paſſed the Earle of Charolois, and cauſed his tents whereof he was well furniſhed, to be pitched: ouer the ſame bridge paſſed alſo his whole armie and artillerie, and lodged vpon the ſide of a hill hanging towards the riuer, by means whereof his campe made a goodly ſhew to thoſe that came after.</p>
               <p>It was that whole daies worke to conuey ouer the Earles owne forces, but the next morning by day breake paſſed alſo the Dukes of Berry and Britaine with their whole armie, commending this bridge to be very commodiouſly and ſpeedily made, and marched when they were paſſed, a little beyond the Earle, and encamped alſo vpon the hill. When it was darke night we diſcouered a great number of fires as far from vs as we could well diſcerne, which diuers ſuppoſed to be the Kings forces, but bofore midnight we were aduertiſed that it was <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Calabria <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP6.NOTE1">

barded, all Italians or trained vp in the Italian wars, among whom were <hi>Iames Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liot,</hi> the Earle of Campobache, the L. of Baudricourt now gouernor of Burgundie, and diuers others: his men of armes were very expert ſoldiers, and to ſay the truth, the flower of our armie, I meane number for number. With him were alſo fower hundred croſſebow men that the Palſgraue had lent him, all very well mounted and very good ſoldiers. Beſides whom he had alſo in pay fiue hundred Switzers foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which were the firſt that euer came into this realme, and theſe ſo valiantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued themſelues in all places where they came, that they purchaſed great renowme to their whole nation, which their countreymen that haue ſerned heere ſince, haue well maintained. This companie the next morning approached neer to vs, and paſſed that day ouer our bridge, which a man may boldly ſay conuaied ouer all the power of Fraunce ſaue onely the Kings armie. And I aſſure you the force was ſo great of valiant men well appointed, and in very good order, that I wiſh all the friends and welwillers of the realme had ſeen it, and likewiſe the enimies: for by that meanes the former would haue eſteemed of the realme as it deſerueth, and the later euer after the more haue feared it. The Burgundians that accompanied the Duke of Calabria were led by the L. of Neuf-chaſtell Marſhall of Burgundie, who had with him his brother the L. of Montagu, the Marqueſſe of Rotelin, and a great number of knights and eſquiers: ſome of the which had been in Bourbonnois, as I haue made mention in the beginning of this hiſtorie <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP6.NOTE3">

               <p>After this whole force (being as I ſuppoſe to the number of an hundred thouſand horſe good &amp; bad) was paſſed the riuer, the Princes determined to ſhew themſelues before Paris, wherfore they put all their vawards togither.

The Earle of Charolois and the Duke of Calabria were very diligent in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and giuing good order in the armie, and rode very well armed, and ſhewed that they meant to do their dutie, but the Dukes of Berry and Britaine were mounted vpon ſmall ambling nags, and armed with ſlight brigandines, light and thin, yea and ſome ſaid they were not plated, but ſtudded onely with a few gilt nailes vpon the ſattin for the leſſe waight, but I will not affirme it for a truth. Thus marched this armie to Pont de Charenton two little leagues from Paris, which was taken incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, notwithſtanding the reſiſtance of certaine franke archers <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP6.NOTE5">

Mor-des-foſſes, and the reſt they ſent to S.

Seldome is any man put out of office: for the Court of parlament alloweth theſe ſales of offices as lawfull, the reaſon whereof is bicauſe it is a generall caſe.

               <head>How King Lewis entred into Paris, while the Princes of Fraunce practiſed with the citizens. Chap. 8.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue been long in this diſcourſe, and it is now time to returne to the hiſtorie. After the Princes were come before Paris, they began to practiſe with the citizens, promiſing offices and great rewards to diuers, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing that might further their purpoſe. At three daies end the citizens aſſembled togither in the towne hall, where when they had long debated theſe matters, and heard the Princes requeſts &amp; demands made openly to them for the benefit of the whole realme (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:) they determined to ſend ambaſſadors to them to treate of peace, according to the which determination a great number of the beſt citizens came to Saint Mor where the Princes lay, and Maſter <hi>VVilliam Chartier</hi> then Biſhop of Paris, a notable prelate, declared the citizens embaſſage, and for the Princes the Earle of Dunois was appointed to be mouth. The Duke of Berry the Kings brother was preſident of this Councill ſitting in a chaire, and all the other Princes ſtanding about him. On the one ſide ſtood the Dukes of Britaine and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria, and on the other the Earle of Charolois armed at all peeces ſaue the head peece and vantbraſes, and wearing vpon his quirage a ſhort cloke maruellous rich: for he came from Conflans: and Bois-de-Vincennes being well manned was held for the King: wherefore it ſtood him vpon to come armed and well accompanied. The Princes requeſt was to enter into Paris to confer with the citizens about the reformation of the ſtate, which they ſaid was euill gouerned, charging the King with diuers diſorders. The citizens gaue them very lowly and humble language, deſiring reſpite before they could make any reſolute anſwer: yet (notwithſtanding this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay) the King was afterward diſcontented both with the Biſhop and the reſt that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7649:23"/>
accompanied him. Thus returned theſe ambaſſadors into the towne, continuing ſtill their former practiſe: for euery one of the Princes talked with them apart, and I am of opinion that ſome of them had agreed ſecretly to ſuffer the Princes in their owne perſons to enter the towne, and their men alſo (if they ſo thought good) by ſmall troupes: which practiſe if it had taken effect, had not onely been the winning of the towne, but the atchieuing of the whole enterpriſe. For the citizens would eaſily haue been brought for diuers conſiderations to reuolt to them, and ſo conſequently all the other townes in the realme. But God put wiſe counſell into the Kings head, which alſo he executed accordingly, being alreadie aduertiſed of all theſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes.</p>
               <p>Before the ambaſſadors that were returned from the Princes had made their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the King in perſon entred the towne of Paris, accompanied like a prince that commeth to relieue his people: for he brought with him into the towne two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men of armes, all the nobles of Normandie, a great number of franke archers, and all his owne ſeruants, penſioners and others that vſe to accompanie the King in ſuch affaires. Thus this practiſe was broken off, and all the people altered their mindes, neither durſt any of them that had been with vs make farther mention of the Princes demaunds. Some of them alſo ſped but euill for that they had alreadie done, notwithſtanding the King vſed no extremitie towards them <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP8.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>, but ſome loſt their offices, and others were ſent to dwell in other places: for the which eaſie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the King vndoubtedly deſerued great commendation, conſidering that if this practiſe begun had taken effect, the beſt that could haue happened to him had been to forſake his realme, which alſo was his reſolution. For as himſelfe hath often told me, if he could not haue entred into Paris, but had found the towne reuolted, he would haue retired to the Switzers, or to <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of Milan, whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his eſpeciall friend, and ſo alſo the Duke ſhewed himſelfe, as well by the aide he ſent him being fiue hundred men of armes and three thouſand footemen vnder the leading of his eldeſt ſonne <hi>Galeas</hi> afterward Duke of Milan (who came as far as the countrey of Forreſtz in Auuergne, where he made war vpon the Duke of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, and afterward returned home bicauſe of his fathers death:) as alſo by the counſell he gaue him at the treatie of peace held at Conflans, where he ſent him word to refuſe no condition of peace, but to ſeuer his companie, and retain his owne forces ſtill about him.</p>
               <p>We had hardly been three daies before Paris when the King entred the towne, immediately after whoſe arriuall ſharpe war was made vpon vs, eſpecially vpon our forragers, whom we were conſtrained to garde with great forces, bicauſe they went far from our campe. Now to ſpeake ſomwhat of the towne of Paris, we muſt needes confeſſe that it is maruellous well ſituate in the Ile of Fraunce, ſeeing the countrey about it was able to victuall two ſuch huge armies: for as touching vs we neuer lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and they within the towne found nothing enhaunced, ſaue onely a denier <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP8.NOTE2">

Wherefore all things conſidered this towne is ſituate in the beſt and fruitfulleſt ſoile that euer I ſawe, yea it is almoſt incredible how great the prouiſion is that commeth thither. I my ſelfe was reſident there ſince the time I now write of, halfe a yeere togither with K. <hi>Levvis</hi> being lodged at the Tournelles, and ordinarily eating and lodging in the court. Since his death alſo by the ſpace of twentie moneths, full ſore againſt my will I was held priſoner in his pallace, where I ſaw daily out of my windowe the prouiſion that came vp the ſtreame out of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7649:23"/>
and likewiſe downe the ſtreame, which was ſo great that I would neuer haue beleeued it, had I not ſeene it.</p>
               <p>Diuers bands as you haue heard iſſued daily out of Paris, &amp; the skirmiſhes were great, our watch being of fiftie launces, ſtood neere to la Grange aux Merciers, but our eſcouts rode as neere Paris as was poſſible, the which were often beaten backe to our watch, and eftſoones (the enimie on their backe) as far as our cariage, retirng ſomtime a ſoftpace, and ſomtime a faſt trot. Then vſed we to renforce them with new ſupplies, which beat backe the enimies hard to the towne gates, and this was daily and howerly done, for within the towne were aboue 2500. men of armes in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good order, and a great number of gentlemen of Normandy, and franke archers, beſides that they ſawe daily their Ladies which encouraged them to put foorth themſelues. Our force was alſo verie great, but in horſemen we were not ſo ſtrong as they, for we had with vs onely the Burgundians being about two thouſand launces good and bad, nothing ſo well armed as they within Paris, bicauſe of the long peace wherein they had liued as before is mentioned, of the which number alſo two hundred men of armes were at Laigny with the Duke of Calabria, but of footemen we had great force, and thoſe very good. The Britains armie laie at Saint Denys, making war on that ſide the towne of Paris all the waies they could, and the other noblemen were diſparkled ſome heere ſome there, to make prouiſion of victuals. In the end the Duke of Nemours, the Earle of Armignac, &amp; the Lord of Albret came to vs, but their forces lodged a good way from our campe bicauſe they had no pay, and ſhould haue famiſhed our armie, if they had taken ought without money. This I am ſure of, that the Earle of Charolois gaue them fiue or ſixe thouſand franckes, and tooke order that they ſhould come no neerer vs. They were at the leaſt fiue or ſixe thouſand horſe that did maruellous much harme in the countrey.</p>

Notwithſtanding, one morning very early 4000. archers came and encamped along by the riuer ſide vpon the very banke, directly ouer againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flans.

them and their footemen was onely a faire plaine. The riuer of Seine ran betweene them and vs, and they began to dig a trench hard by Charenton, which ran in length to the very end of our campe, directly ouer againſt the which, (the riuer being betweene vs and them as you haue heard) they built a bulwarke of wood and earth, and thereon mounted greatſtore of artilirie, which at the verie firſt ſhot cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Duke of Calabrias men out of the village of Charenton, and forced them in great haſte to come and lodge with vs with loſſe both of men and horſes. But the Duke of Calabria himſelfe laie in a litle houſe betweene the riuer and the Earle of Charolois lodging, directly ouer againſt the enimies.</p>
               <p>This artilerie ſhot alſo into our campe, and put the whole armie in great feare, for the verie firſt ſhot ſlew certaine of our men, and twiſe it ſtrake through the Earle of Charolois chamber as he ſat at dinner, and ſlew a trumpetter vpon the ſtaires, bearing vp a diſh of meate. Wherefore after dinner the Earle remooued into a low parlor reſoluing not to depart thence. The next morning the Princes met at his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to conſult what was to be done: for they euer ſate in counſell there, and at their riſing dined alſo there togither. The Dukes of Berry and Britaine ſate next to the wall vpon the bench, and the Earle of Charolois and the Duke of Calabria ouer againſt them. The ſaid Earle placed euery one of them aboue himſelfe, as reaſon was he ſhould ſome of them, yea all of them ſeeing they were in his lodging. There they deuiſed to countermount all the artillerie in their armie againſt the Kings, wherof the Earle of Charolois had great ſtore, as had alſo the Dukes of Calabria &amp; Britaine: for accompliſhment of which their purpoſe, they pearced the wals along the riuer ſide behinde Conflans, and there mounted all the beſt peeces of their artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, ſaue the Bombards and the other great peeces which ſhot not: the reſt alſo they planted in other places where they might do beſt ſeruice, and by this meanes the Princes had much more artillerie on their ſide than the King on his.</p>
               <p>The trench that the French had made was of great length, and they wrought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vpon it, aduancing it towards Paris, and caſting the earth towards vs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſaue themſelues from our ſhot: for they lay all in their trench, neither durſt one of them peepe out, bicauſe the medow where they lodged was as plaine as a mans hand. To conclude I neuer heard in ſo ſhort ſpace ſuch a number of Canon ſhot, for we on our ſide ment to remooue them thence by force of artillerie, but vnto them ordinance came daily from Paris, and they plied the matter diligently and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no powder. A great number in our army digged pits in the ground before their lodging, many alſo were made to their hands, for it was a place where men wrought for ſtone. Thus euery man ſhifted for himſelfe the beſt he could, and three or fower daies we paſſed in this eſtate, but the feare was greater on both ſides than the loſſe, for not one man of name was ſlaine.</p>
               <p>But when the Princes ſawe that their enimies diſlodged not, they accounted it a thing tending greatly to their diſhonor, and alſo very dangerous: for the Pariſians were thereby ſo greatly encouraged, that one day of truce it ſeemed all the towne was come foorth to the trenches. Wherefore the Princes concluded as they ſate in councel, to make a large bridge of great botes, the noſes whereof were coupled <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP9.NOTE1">

be far vnderneath vs, conſidering that they had throwen the earth on the ſide toward vs, alleaging farther that they durſt not iſſue foorth of their trenches, for feare of our ſhot, which reaſons much encouraged our men, and made them the willinger to paſſe ouer. Thus the bridge being finiſhed all ſaue the laſt couple of botes, which alſo were vpon the point to be faſtened to the reſt, and all the other botes appointed for conueiance ouer of our men being likewiſe in a readines: ſuddenly one of the Kings heralds arriued there, who ſaid to Monſeur de Bonillet and others there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that we had broken the truce. For bicauſe that day and the day before were daies of truce, euery man that liſted came to ſee what we did, but that night the truce ended, our bridge was ſo large that three men of armes with their ſtaues readie to charge, might haue paſſed ouer it vpon a front. Farther there were fiue or ſixe great boates, euery one of the which would haue conueied ouer a thouſand men at a time, beſides a number of leſſe boates to paſſe ouer the artilerie that ſhould ſerue in this enterpriſe. The bands were alſo named, and their names enroled that ſhould go, and the Earle of S. Paul, and the Lord of Haultbourdin ordained to leade them. After midnight they that were appointed to this enterpriſe began to arme themſelues, and before day were al in a readines. Some alſo went &amp; heard maſſe, and did as good Chriſtians ought to do in ſuch a caſe. The ſame night I was my ſelfe in a great tent in the middeſt of the armie where the watch ſtood, being alſo one of the watch: for no man was excuſed. The captaine of the watch was Monſeur de Chaſtell Guyon <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP9.NOTE2">

                  </ref>. And as we ſtood there waiting when this paſtime ſhould begin, ſuddenly we heard the French as they lodged in their trenches cry alowd: Farewell neighbors, farewell, immediately whereupon they ſet fire on their lodgings and retired their artillerie. The day began to breake, and they that were appointed to this enterpriſe were alreadie vpon the riuer, at the leaſt part of them when they ſaw the enimies afar off retiring to Paris, whereupon they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all, and vnarmed themſelues, reioicing much bicauſe of their departure. But you ſhall vnderſtand that the King ſent them thither onely to beate our campe with artillerie, not to fight: for he would put nothing in aduenture, as before I haue ſaid, notwithſtanding that his force were ſufficient to haue encountred with all theſe Princes ioined togither, but his onely deſire was, as he well declared, to treate of peace, and to ſeuer this company without hazarding his eſtate and the ſtate of this large and noble realme of Fraunce in battell, than the which nothing can be more vncertaine nor dangerous.</p>
               <p>Euery day they practiſed on both ſides to with draw men ech from other, &amp; diuers daies of truce were made, during the which Commiſſioners ſat on both ſides to treat of peace at <hi>La Grange aux Merciers</hi> hard by our campe. For the King, the Earle of Maine with diuers others came thither, and for the Princes, the Earle of S. Paul accompanied with diuers others in like maner. Theſe Commiſſioners met often, but no good was done: notwithſtanding all that time the truce endured, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of both the armies met and communed togither at a great ditch in the midway: the one, on the one ſide: and the others, on the other: for neither partie might paſſe the ditch. Notwitſtanding the truce, no day eſcaped by reaſon of this meeting and communication, but that ten or twelue, and ſomtime more, came and yeelded to the Princes, and another day as many went from vs to the King: wherefore this place was afterward called the market place, bicauſe ſuch marchandiſe was bought and ſold there. Now to ſhew you mine opinion in this caſe, me thinketh that ſuch mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and communing togither at ſuch times, and in ſuch ſort is very dangerous, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for him that is likeſt to take the foile: for naturally moſt men deſire to aduance
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7649:25"/>
themſelues, at the leaſt to ſaue themſelues: wherefore they will eaſilie be wonne to turne to the ſtrongeſt. Some there are I confeſſe ſo faithfull and conſtant, that none of theſe reſpects can alter them, but few ſuch are to be found. Farther this danger is then ſpecially to be feared, when we deale with a Prince that will endeuor him ſelfe to winne men: which ſure is a great grace of God in any Prince that can frame him ſelfe thereunto, for it is a token that he is not infected with the foule vice and ſinne of pride, which all men deteſt and abhor. But to conclude this diſcourſe, when a Prince mindeth to treat of peace, he ought to employ therein the faithfulleſt and truſtieſt ſeruants he hath, being men of ripe yeeres, leſt their lacke of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience cauſe them either to conclude ſome diſhonorable treaty, or put their maſter in greater feare at their returne than there is cauſe why. Farther a Prince ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch affaires rather to thoſe that haue receaued benefit at his hands than to ſuch as neuer were benefited by him, but eſpecially to wiſe men, for he ſhall neuer make profit by imploying a foole. Beſides this, ſuch treaties ought to be held rather far from his campe than neere vnto it, and when the Commiſſioners returne, the Prince muſt giue them audience, himſelfe alone or in preſence of verie fewe, to the end that if their newes be diſcomfortable, they may be inſtructed how to anſwer thoſe that will be inquiſitiue, for all men will deſire to vnderſtand newes of them, yea and ſome of their familiars will thinke that they wil hide nothing from them, notwithſtanding if they be ſuch men as I haue heere deſcribed, and know their maſter to be wiſe, they will reueale nothing to any man whoſoeuer.</p>

time, for he was the wiſeſt Prince in winding himſelfe out of trouble and aduerſitie, the humbleſt in words, the plaineſt in apparell, and the greateſt traueller to win a man that might do him ſeruice or harme that euer I knew. Neither vſed he to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his ſute for the firſt refuſal, but labored the party continually by large promiſes and liberall gifts, as well of great ſums of money as alſo of ſuch eſtates and offices as he knew would content him. And as touching thoſe whom he had baniſhed and withdrawne his fauor from in peace and proſperitie: he bought them deerely againe when he needed them, and imploied them in his ſeruice, cleane forgetting all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces paſſed. He loued naturally men of meane eſtate, and was enimie to all ſuch as needed not to depende vpon him: neuer Prince gaue audience to ſo many men, neuer Prince was inquiſitiue of ſo many matters, nor deſirous to be acquainted with ſo many ſtrangers as he, whereby he knew aſwell all that were in authoritie and eſtimation in England, Spaine, Portugale, Italie, and the Seniories of Burgundie and Britaine, as his owne ſubiects. And by theſe vertues preſerued he his eſtate, which ſtood in great danger at his firſt comming to the crowne, bicauſe of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies himſelfe had procured to himſelfe. But his great liberalitie eſpecially ſerued him to good purpoſe, for as in aduerſitie he wiſely behaued himſelfe, ſo contrariwiſe in time of peace or truce, he lightlie fell out with his ſeruants, by picking trifling quarels to them, and ſuch was his diſpoſition, that he could hardly away with peace or quietnes. In his talke he ſpared no man, neither abſent nor preſent, ſaue ſuch as he feared, which were many, for naturally he was very fearfull. Farther, when his talke had either turned him to diſpleaſure, or was like ſo to do, he would endeuor himſelfe to amend the matter, by vſing theſe or ſuch like words to the partie offended: I know well that my toong hath wrought me much diſpleaſure, but it hath alſo oftentimes ſtood me in great ſtead, notwithſtanding reaſon it is that I ſhould repaire the iniurie done, and when he vſed this familiar ſpeech, he euer gaue withall ſome great preſent to the partie greeued. Sure the knowledge of good and euill is a great gift of God to a Prince, I meane when the good ſurmounteth the euill, as it did in the King our Maſter, who in mine opinion was much bettered by the trouble he ſuſtained in his youth, when he fled from his father and ſoiourned with Duke <hi>Philip</hi> of Burgundy the ſpace of ſixe yeeres <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP10.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>: for he was conſtrained there to frame himſelfe to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of thoſe whom he ſtood in neede of, which ſingular vertue aduerſitie taught him. But after his fathers death, when he came firſt to the ſtate he thought onely vpon reuenge, but ſoone felt the ſmart thereof, and therefore foorthwith changed his minde, acknowledged his error, repaired the harmes done, and ſought to recouer by large benefits thoſe whom he had offended, as heerafter you ſhall perceiue. And I thinke verily he ſhould neuer haue wound himſelfe out of thoſe troubles had not his education been better than noble mens commonly is in this realme, who are brought vp altogither in wantonnes and diſſolutenes, as well in apparell as in talke, they are vtterly vnlearned, there is not one wiſe man about them: they haue gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors that diſpoſe of all their affaires, but they themſelues do nothing: yea ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men there are hardly of fower nobles rent that glorie in ſaying, Speake to my ſeruants, thinking thereby to imitate great Princes. But I haue oftentimes ſeene their ſeruants ſo make their profit of them, that their folly hath thereby appeered to the whole world. And if any of them happen at the length to looke about him, and to attend to his owne buſines, it is ſo late that it ſeemeth almoſt to no purpoſe: for all thoſe that haue been great or done great things began in their tender age, which vertue proceedeth either of their bringing vp, or of the grace of God.</p>

Now to returne to the wars, you haue heard how theſe archers that lay in the trench along vpon the riuer of Seine, diſlodged at the very inſtant that we ſhould haue aſſailed them. The truce neuer endured paſt a day or two, and when it ended ſharpe war began againe, and the skirmiſhes continued from morning till night, but no great force iſſued foorth of the towne, notwithſtanding they beat backe our ſcoutes often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whom we euer releeued with new ſupplies. There paſſed no day without ſome skirmiſh great or ſmall, and I thinke the King would haue had them greater, had it not been bicauſe he was ielous of diuers though needleſly. I haue heard him ſay that one night he found the poſterne of Saint Anthonies baſtile towards the fields wide open, which put him in ſuſpicion of Maſter <hi>Charles</hi> of Melun, whoſe father kept the place, yet ſure a faithfuller ſeruant than the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> that yeere the King had none.</p>
               <p>One day they within Paris determined to iſſue foorth to fight with vs, of the which enterpriſe I ſuppoſe the King vnderſtood nothing, but it was onely his captaines reſolution, they meant to aſſaile vs three ſeuerall waies, their greateſt band ſhould haue come from Paris, another from Pont de Charenton, which two could not greatly haue endamaged vs, and the third appointed to be two hundred men of armes from Bois-de-Vincennes. Of this reſolution we were aduertiſed about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night by a Page that told vs this newes as lowd as he could crie from the other ſide of the riuer by the commandement of the Princes friends within the towne, ſome of the which alſo he named and ſo departed. By breake of day iſſued foorth Maſter <hi>Poncet</hi> of Riuiere before Pont de Charenton, and the Lord of Lauon the other ſide from Bois-de-Vincennes euen hard to our artillerie, where they ſlue one of our gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The alarme was great in our campe: for we ſuppoſed this to be the enterpriſe, whereof the Page aduertiſed vs ouer night. The Earle of Charolois was ſoone ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet not ſo ſoone as <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Calabria, for at all alarmes he was the firſt man armed, and that at all points, and his horſe euer barded. Moreouer he ware ſuch a garment as the famous men of war vſe in Italy, and ſhewed himſelfe both a noble Prince, and a woorthy Captaine: he rode ſtraight to the barriars of our campe to ſtaie our men fom iſſuing foorth, where he was as well obeyed as the Earle of Charolois him ſelfe: yea the whole armie obeied him more willingly than any man in the companie, of the which honor vndoubtedly he was woorthie. Incontinent our whole force was in armes &amp; ſtood in order of battell within our cariage, all ſaue
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7649:26"/>
two hundred horſe that kept our watch abroad. To be ſhort, this day we looked aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly for the battell, but neuer before nor neuer after. Soone after the Earle of Charolois and the Duke of Calabria, arriued the Dukes of Berry and Britaine, whom I neuer ſaw armed but this day onely. The Duke of Berry was armed at all points: notwithſtanding they were but weakely accompanied, in the which eſtate they paſſed through the campe, and rode foorth to the Lords of Charolois and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria where they communed togither. Our ſcoutes being renforced, rode as neere Paris as they could, and diſcouered a great number of our enimies ſcouts, comming to learne what noiſe this was in our army. Our artillerie ſhot terriblie when Monſeur <hi>De Lau</hi> approched ſo neere vs: the King alſo had good peeces vpon Paris wals, that ſhot into our campe which was ſtrange: for we lay two leagues from the town, but I thinke the peeces were mounted to the moſt aduantage. This thundering of the artillerie, cauſed both the parties to thinke ſome great enterpriſe to be towards: The day was very darke and cloudy, and our ſcouts approching neer to Paris, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered many enimies abroad in the field, and a good way beyond them, a number of launces held vpright (as they ſuppoſed,) which they iudged to be the Kings whole force, and all the people of Paris iſſued foorth of the towne in order of battel: which imagination the darknes of the heauens put into their head. They returned foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the Princes being yet without our campe, &amp; aduertiſed them of this news, aſſuring them of the battell. The ſcoutes that were iſſued foorth of Paris approched ſtill neerer and neerer to our campe, bicauſe they ſaw ours retire: which thing ſo much the more increaſed in our ſcoutes their former imagination. Then came the Duke of Calabria to the place where a great number of the Earle of Charolois houſhold ſeruants ſtood to accompanie his ſtandard and his banner readie to be diſplaied, and the guidon of his armes according to the cuſtome of the houſe of Burgundy, and there the ſaid Duke of Calabria ſpake thus to vs all: We haue now our deſire, for the King is iſſued foorth with his whole force, and marcheth forward as our ſcouts tell vs. Wherefore let vs determine to play the men.

                  </ref>, wherefore the Earle of Charolois tooke the redeeming of theſe townes in very euill part. This treatie of peace was ſo followed, that one morning the King came by water directly ouer againſt our campe, leauing his horſemen that accompanied him vpon the riuer ſide, and hauing in the barge with him beſides the water men that rowed, onely fower or fiue perſons, namely Monſeur <hi>Du Lau,</hi> Monſeur <hi>De Montauban</hi> then admirall of Fraunce, and Monſeur <hi>De Nantouillet,</hi> with one or two more. The Earles of Charolois and Saint Paul ſtood on the other ſide of the riuer to receiue the King, who ſaid thus to the Earle of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolois, Brother, do you aſſure me in the word of a Prince, (for the Earles firſt wife was the Kings ſiſter <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP12.NOTE4">

Then the King &amp; his company landed, the two Earles receiuing him honorablie according to his eſtate, and he hauing words at will, began thus &amp; ſaid: Brother, I know you to be a gentleman &amp; of the houſe of Fraunce: why, ſir, quoth the Earle? bicauſe ſaid the K. when I ſent of late mine Ambaſſadors to mine vncle your father, &amp; you to Liſle, where my fooliſh chancellor <hi>Moruillier</hi> ſo much misbehaued himſelfe toward you: you ſent me word by the Archbiſhop of Narbonne (who is a gentleman as his behauiour there well declared,) that before a yeere expired I ſhould repent me of the proud language the ſaid <hi>Moruillier</hi> there vſed. You haue kept promiſe indeed, and that long before your daie: which words the King ſpake with a merrie cheerefull countenance, knowing his nature with whom he talked to be ſuch that they would pleaſe him wel, as vndoubtedly they did. Then the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further ſaying, I loue to deale with men that keepe promiſe. Afterward he diſauowed <hi>Moruilliers</hi> words, ſaying that he had ſpoken beyond his commiſſion. To be ſhort, the King walked a long time between theſe two Earles, a great number of the Earle of Charolois ſouldiers in armes ſtanding by, and marking diligently their behauiour. At this meeting the Earles required the Duchie of Normandie, and the townes ſituate vpon the riuer of Somme, with diuers other particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for themſelues, and certaine ouertures lately treated of for the common wealth of the realme, but vpon thoſe they ſtood leſt: for the weale publique was now turned into wealth priuate. As touching Normandie the King would hardly

Many miſliked theſe ſendings to and fro, ſo far foorth that the Princes began now to miſtruſt and abandon each other, in ſuch ſort that had not one thing happened ſoone after <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP12.NOTE5">

                  </ref>, they had all departed with great diſhonor. Twiſe I ſawe them hold three ſeuerall aſſemblies in one chamber where they were togither, wherewith the Earle of Charolois was maruellouſly offended: for he thought, ſeeing the greateſt force of this armie was his, that they did him wrong to ſit in counſell in his chamber, he being preſent, without calling him to it: wherefore he debated this matter with the Lord of Contay a very wiſe gentleman, who aduiſed him to take it patiently, bicauſe if he ſhould alienate their mindes from him they could better make their peace than he, adding that as he was the ſtrongeſt, ſo ought he to be the wiſeſt, and farther counſelling him to do his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor by all meanes poſſible for their continuance togither in friendſhip, and in no wiſe to fall at variance with them, but to digeſt and winke at all theſe diſorders. Laſtly he told him that all men woondered, yea his owne ſeruants, that ſo meane perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as the two aboue named were imploied in ſo weighty affaires: alleaging great danger to be therein, conſidering how liberall a Prince he was whom he had to deale with. True it is that this <hi>Contay</hi> hated <hi>VVilliam</hi> of Biſche, notwithſtanding heerin he ſpake but as others did, and I thinke verily not vpon malice but as the caſe required. The Earle of Charolois followed his aduiſe, and began to ſport &amp; paſtime with the Princes otherwiſe than he had been accuſtomed, to ſhew them a cheerfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, &amp; to commune oftener both with them &amp; their ſeruants, and ſure ſo was it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite: for they ſtood euen vpon the point to ſeuer themſelues. A wiſe man doth good ſeruice in ſuch a companie, if he may be credited, neither can he be valued too deere, but I neuer knew Prince in my life that could finde the difference betweene man and man till he ſtood in need of men: and if any happily do, yet make they no account of a wiſe man, but place in authoritie about them thoſe whom they fauor better, either bicauſe they are of equall yeeres with them, or ſeeke in all things to feede their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, wherein they are often nuzled by the furtherers of their wanton pleaſures. But wiſe Princes will ſoone reforme themſelues when neede requireth, ſuch as were the King our maſter, the Earle of Charolois at that time, King <hi>Edward</hi> of England, and diuers others: but theſe three eſpecially I haue ſeene at ſo lowe an ebbe, that they haue ſtood in great neede of thoſe whom before they deſpiſed. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as touching the Earle of Charolois, after he was Duke of Burgundie, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier aduaunced by fortunes fauor than euer was any of his predeceſſors, and growen ſo great that he feared no Prince of his eſtate, God ouerthrew him in all his glorie: and ſo bereaued him of his wits, that he contemned all mens counſell but his owne, wherby he miſerably ended his life, with a great number of his ſeruants and ſubiects, leauing his houſe deſolate as you ſee.</p>

For while the commiſſioners ſat to treat of peace, by means wherof men met &amp; communed togither: in ſteede of treating of peace ſome practiſed to yeeld the Duchie of Normandie to the Kings onely brother the Duke of Berry, to the end he might there take his partage, and reſtore Berry to the King, which enterpriſe was alſo executed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording: for the Lady of Brezey, the late Seneſchall of Normandies widow, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of hir kins folkes and ſeruants by hir perſwaſion, receiued <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon into the caſtell of Roan, and finally into the towne, the which willingly conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this mutation, as did alſo all the other townes and places in the countrey, a few excepted. For the Normans haue euer been and yet are of opinion, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for them (their countrie being ſo large) to haue their Prince reſident among them, neither deſire they any thing more: and ſure it is a goodly thing and a rich: for I my ſelfe haue knowen the reuenues thereof nine hundred and fiftie thouſand frankes, <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP13.NOTE1">

               <p>After the towne was reuolted, all the inhabitants gaue their oth to the Duke of Bourbon as the Duke of Berries lieutenant, ſaue the bailiffe of the towne named <hi>Onaste</hi> (who had been a groome of the Kings chamber in Flaunders and neere about him) and another called <hi>VVilliam Piquart,</hi> afterward generall of Normandie, and the high Seneſchall of Normandie that now is, who alſo departed to the King againſt his mothers will, who (as you haue heard) was the chiefe author of the citizens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt. When the King heard this newes he reſolued to make peace, ſeeing he could not vndoo that was already done. Wherefore incontinent he ſent word to the Earle of Charolois being in his campe, that he would gladly ſpeake with him, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the hower when he would meete him in the fields by Conflans, neere to the ſaid campe, at which hower he came, accompanied with an hundred horſe, all in manner
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7649:28"/>
Scottiſh men of his garde. The Earle of Charolois met him with a ſmall traine without any ceremonie, notwithſtanding many of his ſeruants went after him, ſo that in the end his company was greater than the Kings, but he cauſed them to ſtay a pretie way off, and when the King and he had walked togither a while, the King told him that the peace was already made, and aduertiſed him of al that was hapned at Roan (whereof the Earle as yet vnderſtood nothing) adding that notwithſtanding he would neuer willingly haue granted his brother ſo large a partage: yet now ſeeing the Normans themſelues had made this mutation, he would agree thereunto, and paſſe the treatie in maner and forme, as before at diuers meetings was deuiſed, for as touching the other articles they had to agree vpon, they were but trifles. The Earle of Charolois was glad of theſe newes, for his army lay in great diſtreſſe of vittailes, but more of money, and had not this hapned, all theſe Princes had been forced to depart with great diſhonor. Notwithſtanding to the Earle of Charolois the ſame day, or within two or three daies after came a new releefe both of men and money, ſent him by Duke <hi>Philip</hi> his father out of Burgundy, vnder the leading of the Lord of Sauenſes, being ſix ſcore men of armes, and fifteene hundred archers, and ſix ſcore thouſand crownes vpon ten ſumpter horſes, with great ſtore of bowes and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, which furniſhed reaſonably well the Burgundians army, who ſtood in great doubt that the other Princes would make peace without them.</p>
               <p>This communication of peace pleaſed ſo well both the King and the Earle of Charolois, and ſo deſirous they were (as I haue heard the Earle himſelfe ſay,) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the treatie, that they marked not which way they walked, but rode ſtraight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Paris, ſo far foorth, that they entred into a great bulwarke of wood and earth, that the King had cauſed to be made a good way without the towne, at the end of a trench, by the which laie a way into the towne. The Earle was accompanied but with foure or fiue perſons who were much abaſed when they ſaw themſelues within the bullwarck: notwithſtanding he himſelfe ſet a good face on the matter. But when this newes came to the campe the whole army began to mutter, and the Earle of S. Paul, the marſhal of Burgundie, the Lord of Contay, the Lord of Hault-bourdin, &amp; diuers others aſſembled togither, blaming greatly both the Earle, and thoſe that accompanied with him, of this follie, and alleadging the inconuenience that hape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his grandfather at Montereau-faut-Yonne in the preſence of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 7. Wherefore incontinent they commanded all the ſoldiers that were walking abroad in the fields to retire into their campe. And the marſhall of Burgundie ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Neuf-chaſtel ſaid thus: though this fooliſh harebrained yoong Prince be gone to caſt awaie himſelfe: yet let vs prouide that his houſe, his fathers eſtate, and we our ſelues fall not into danger: wherefore mine aduiſe is that euerie man repaire to his lodging, and be in a readines, baniſhing al feare whatſoeuer hapen. For we are ſtrong inough if we ſeuer not, to retire to the marches of Henaut, or Picardie, or into Burgundie. When he had thus ſaid, he and the Earle of Saint Paul mounted on horſebacke, and walked out of the campe to ſee if they coulde deſcrie any body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from Paris: where after they had ſtoode a while, they diſcouered forty or fiftie horſes being certeine of the Kings ſeruants, as well archers as others that waited backe vpon the Earle of Charolois: who ſo ſoone as he perceiued theſe two ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, cauſed the French men to return: he ſtood in awe of the marſhall, bicauſe he vſed to giue him verie ſharpe language, neither feared ſometimes to tell him that he was but lent him during his fathers life. Wherfore minding now to preuent him, he ſaid thus, Chide me not, I acknowledge my great follie, but I was hard by the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke before I wiſt. But this notwithſtanding the marſhal ſaid more to his face, then
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7649:29"/>
he had ſpoken behinde his backe, and ſure he was a faithfull and a truſtie knight. The Earle anſwered nothing but held downe his hed, and entred into this campe where they were all glad of his returne, and commended the Kings faith: and ſure it is to be thought that both the King and the Earle had great regard of their honor, conſidering that each of them putting himſelfe into others hands: Yet neither of them receiued harme, notwithſtanding the Earle neuer after returned vnder the Kings power.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the end all matters were fully concluded, and the next day as the E. of Charolois was making his muſters to know what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he had loſt: ſuddenly the King accompanied with thirty or forty horſe, came thither without warning giuen, and rid about to view all the bandes one after another, ſaue the marſhals of Burgundy who loued him not: bicauſe not long before the King hauing once giuen him Pinal in Loraine, tooke it afterward again from him to beſtow vpon <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Calabria greatlie to the ſaid marſhals damage. The King (acknowledging his error) by little and little reconciled him ſelfe to the wiſe and valiant knights that ſerued the King his father, whom he at his firſt comming to the crowne diſplaced, wherefore they were with the Princes in armes againſt him. Farther it was agreed that the next day the King ſhould come to the Caſtell of Vincennes, and likewiſe al the Princes that were to do him homage: for whoſe ſafety the ſaid Caſtell ſhould be put into the Earle of Charolois hands, according to which agreement the next morning thither came the King, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all the princes none being abſent, the porche and the gate being manned with Burgundians well armed: there the treatie of peace was concluded. <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP14.NOTE1">

                  </ref> The Lord <hi>Charles</hi> did the King homage for the Duchie of Normandie, and the Earle of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolois for the townes in Picardie aboue mentioned, as did alſo all the reſt that had homage to do, and the Earle of Saint Paul tooke his othe for the office of Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but according to the common prouerbe, neuer was ſo plentifull a marriage feaſt, but ſome departed vndined, for heere ſome had what them luſted, and others nothing. The King receiued into his ſeruice certaine gentlemen that were with his brother, and alſo certaine meane perſons, but the greateſt part remained ſtill with his ſaid brother the new Duke of Normandie &amp; the D. of Britain, who went to Roan to take poſſeſſion. At their departure from the caſtell of Vincennes they tooke their leaue each of other, and returned to their lodgings: farther, all letters, pardons, and other writings ſeruing for the confirmation of the peace were made. On one day departed all theſe three Princes, the Duke of Normandy and Britaine firſt into Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, and the Duke of Britaine from thence into his owne countrie, and the Earle of Charolois into Flaunders. But when the Earle was ready to take horſe, the King meaning effectually to ſhew how greatly he deſired his friendſhip, came to him and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7649:29"/>
accompanied him to Villiers-le-bell a village fower leagues from Paris, where both theſe Princes lodged that night. The Kings traine was very ſmall, but he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two hundred men of armes to follow him to conuey him backe: whereof the Earle of Charolois being aduertiſed as he went to bed, fell into great ſuſpicion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and commanded a great number of his ſeruants to be in armes. Thus you ſee how impoſſible it is for two great Princes to agree, bicauſe of the ſuſpicious tales and reports that are daily and howerly beaten into their heads. Wherefore two Princes that deſire to continue in friendſhip ought neuer to come togither, but to imploy vertuous and wiſe men betweene them, who will encreaſe their amitie, and repaire all ſuch breaches as ſhall happen.</p>
               <p>The next morning the two Princes tooke their leaue each of other with much courteous and wiſe talke, and the King returned to Paris accompanied with the men of armes aboue mentioned, called thither for that purpoſe, whereby he remooued all ſuſpicion the Earle had conceiued of their comming. The ſaid Earle rode towards Compiengne and Noyon, being receiued by the Kings commandement into all the townes he paſſed by. From thence he marched to Amiens where they did him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as did alſo all the other townes vpon the riuer of Somme, &amp; the territories in Picardy reſtored to him by this treaty, which the King not paſt nine moneths before had redeemed for the ſumme of fower hundred thouſand crownes, as before you haue heard. This done, he marched incontinent into the countrie of Liege, bicauſe they had by the ſpace of fiue or ſixe moneths made war vpon his father in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, in the countries of Namur &amp; Brabant, where alſo they had ſlain certaine of his ſubiects <ref target="#S5602.BK1.CHAP14.NOTE2">

On the otherſide the Duke of Britaine thought it reaſon that part of them ſhould be at his diſpoſition, bicauſe the greateſt burden of theſe wars had lien vpon his ſhoulders. To be ſhort, the fire ſo kindled betweene them, that the Duke of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine for ſafety of his perſon was forced to retire to mont S.

I ſpeake of theſe matters vpon the Kings owne report, for I my ſelfe was not preſent at them.

               <head>How the newe Duke of Normandie returned into Britaine in very poore eſtate, and vtterly diſcouraged, bicauſe he had failed of his enterpriſe. Chap. 16.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Duke of Normandie was once determined (as you haue heard) to flie into Flaunders, but at that very inſtant the Duke of Britaine and he reconciled themſelues, acknowledging both of them their errors, and well perceauing all good things by diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to periſh and come to naught. And ſure in mine opinion it is almoſt impoſſible, that many Princes of equall eſtate being togither ſhould long continue in friendſhip and amitie, vnleſſe they haue a ſuperior ouer them, who alſo muſt be wiſe and well eſteemed, to the end he may hold them in due obedience. I haue my ſelfe ſeene many examples heereof, and therfore ſpeake not vpon heareſay. Beſides that, common experience prooueth that we are naturally enclined to fall at variance to our owne harme, not regarding the inconueniences that enſue thereof, which is a generall fault through the whole worlde. Wherefore in mine opinion a wiſe Prince hauing ten thouſand men at his commandement, and knowing how to gouerne them, is more to be feared and eſteemed than ſix Princes confederate togither, with each of them ten thouſand, bicauſe ſo many matters fall in queſtion betweene them, that all good occaſions are loſt, before they can reſolue vpon any thing.</p>
               <p>Thus returned the Duke of Normandie into Britaine in very poore eſtate, and vtterly abandoned of all the Knights aboue mentioned that had ſerued the King his father. for they made their peace with the King, and were better entertained by him than euer they had beene in his fathers time. Theſe two Dukes were wiſe after the hurt receiued (as the common prouerbe ſaith) of the Brittons, and liued togither in Britaine, being gouerned by the Lord of Leſcut their principall ſeruant. And diuers ambaſſadors ran betweene the King and them, and betweene them and the Earle of Charolois, and likewiſe between the King and the Duke of Burgundy, ſome to learne newes, ſome to corrupt one anothers ſeruants and ſubiects, and ſome for diuers other euill purpoſes, and all vnder colour of good faith. Some alſo went with good intent truſting to pacifie theſe troubles, which ſure was great ſimplicitie in them to thinke themſelues wiſe &amp; ſufficient ynough by their preſence to appeaſe Princes ſo great, ſo ſubtill, &amp; ſo well acquainted with all ſorts of fine practiſes as theſe were, eſpecially
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7649:31"/>
neither party inclining to reaſon. But ſome there are ſo blinded with vaine glorie, that they thinke themſelues able to deale in matters that oftentimes they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not: for their Maſters do not alwaies diſcouer to them the bottom of their thoughts. To ſuch it often happeneth that they go but to furniſh the feaſt, yea many times to their owne coſt: for euer one by-fellow or other accompanieth them, that hath ſome ſecret practiſe apart, at the leaſt thus haue I ſeene the matter ordered at all times and in all places where I haue been. Wherefore as I ſaid before, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to be circumſpect whom they imploy in their affaires: ſo ſay I now, that thoſe that are imploied ought to take heede how they negotiate in Princes buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. And who ſo can ſhift off the charge, vnleſſe he vnderſtand it throughly well, and perceiue his Maſter to be well affected thereunto, is to be accounted wiſe: for I haue knowen many a good man in a pecke of troubles with ſuch affaires. Princes alſo I haue ſeene of two contrarie diſpoſitions, the one ſo ſubtill and ſuſpicious, that a man can neuer be acquainted with their humor, for they thinke all the world bent to deceiue them: the other truſt their ſeruants well ynough, but they themſelues are ſo groſſe and vnderſtand ſo little of their owne affaires, that they know not who doth them good ſeruice or bad, whereby they alter their mindes in a moment from loue to hatred, and from hatred to loue. And notwithſtanding that of either ſort few are good and conſtant: yet I for my part had rather liue vnder the wiſe than the fooliſh: bicauſe there are more waies to auoid their diſpleaſure, and recouer their fauour loſt: but with the ignorant a man can deuiſe no ſhift, for no man dealeth with themſelues in any matter, but altogither with their ſeruants, whom alſo they change as oft as the winde. Notwithſtanding in thoſe countries where ſuch Princes raigne, all men are of dutie bound to ſerue and obey them. Wherfore all things conſidered, our onely hope ought to be in God: for he alone is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, he onely is good: but this leſſon we learne too late: yea neuer before we neede his helpe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is better late than neuer.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Mmediately after theſe troubles aboue mentioned, ended in France, the Duke of Burgundie yeere by yeere had war with the Liegeois, againſt whom when the King ſawe him buſied: he vſually attempted ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe againſt the Britons, ſending alſo ſome ſmall aide to the ſaid Liegeois: whereupon the Duke foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with either turned his force againſt the King to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour his confederates, or they concluded ſome treatie or truce. Now you ſhall vnderſtand that in the yeere 1466. Dinand was taken by the Duke of Burgundie, <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP1.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> being a towne in the country of Liege ſtrong and rich for the bignes thereof, by reaſon of their great trade of copper works, commonly called Dinandrie, being pots, pans, and ſuch like imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of Burgundie (who died in the moneth of Iune in the yeere 1467) in his extreme age was borne thither in a litter, ſo much hated he the ſaid towne, bicauſe of their great crueltie vſed againſt his ſubiects in the countie of Namur, eſpecially againſt a little towne called Bouuines, ſituate within a quarter of a league of Dinand, and ſeuered onely with the riuer of Maze. For not long before the time I now write of, they of Dinand beſieged the ſaid towne of Bouuines (the riuer running betweene <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP1.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>) the ſpace of eight moneths, committed many cruell murthers in the countrie thereabout, and ſhot all that ſpace continually with two bombards, and other great peeces of artillerie into the towne: ſo that the poore people were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſaue themſelues in their ſellers, and there to abide. It is almoſt incredible the great hatred that was betweene theſe two towns, notwithſtanding that their children vſually married togither, bicauſe there was no other good towne neere them.</p>
               <p>The yeere before the deſtruction of Dinand being the ſame ſommer, the Earle of Charolois came before Paris with the Princes of Fraunce as you before haue hard: they made a treatie with the Duke of Burgundie, whereby they agreed to giue him a certaine ſumme of money to abandon their league with the citie of Liege, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne their eſtate apart, a manifeſt token of imminent deſtruction, when they that ought to continue togither in amitie, ſeuer themſelues and forſake each other, which I ſpeake as well to great Princes in league togither as to townes and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties. But bicauſe I ſuppoſe euerie man to haue ſeene and read a number of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to this purpoſe I will lightlie paſſe ouer this diſcourſe, onely noting by the way that King <hi>Lewis</hi> our Maſter was the fineſt and cunningeſt Prince in diſſoluing freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip betweene men that euer I knew, for he ſpared neither money, goods, nor tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueill, but labored as well the ſeruants as the maſters. Now to returne to the hiſtorie, they of Dinand ſoone repented them of the treatie aboue mentioned, for they cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put to death foure of their beſt citizens that had beene the chiefe perſwaders of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7649:32"/>
them thereunto, and began war a newe in the countie of Namur: wherefore partlie for theſe conſiderations, &amp; partlie bicauſe of the earneſt ſollicitation of the citizens of Bouuines, D. <hi>Philip</hi> laid the ſiege before the towne, but the charge of the whole army was committed to his ſon. Thither came alſo from his own houſe the Earle of S. Paul Counſtable of France to aide the Duke, not by the Kings commandement, nor with the men of armes that were vnder his charge, but with ſuch force onely as he had leuied in the marches of Picardie. Once they of Dinand made a proud ſallie, and were repulſed to their great loſſe: and the eight day after the towne being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellouſlie beaten with canon was taken by aſſault, <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP1.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> ſo that their freinds had not lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to bethinke them whether they ſhould aide them or not. The towne was burnt and raſed, and the priſoners being to the number of eight hundred drowned before Bouuines. <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP1.NOTE4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> Sure the reuenge was cruell vpon them, but I thinke God had ſo ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it bicauſe of their great wickednes.</p>
               <p>The next day after the towne was taken, the Liegeois came thither with great force <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP1.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> to ſuccour it, contrary to their promiſe, for by the treatie aboue mentioned: they and the towne of Dinand had abandoned each other. Duke <hi>Philip</hi> bicauſe of his old age returned home, but his ſonne with the whole armie marched againſt the Liegeois whom we met ſooner than we looked for. For by chance our vaward miſſed the way for lacke of guides, by meanes wherof our battell met firſt with them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were the principall Captaines of our armie. It was almoſt night when we arriued at the place where they lodged: yet notwithſtanding we marched againſt them, but euen at that very inſtant they ſent ambaſſadors to the Earle of Charolois, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him for the honor of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe euen that was, to haue compaſſion vpon this poore people, excuſing their fault the beſt they could. Yet this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their army made ſhew as though they deſired the battell, &amp; their behauior ſeemed cleane contrary to their ambaſſadors requeſt. But after the ſaid ambaſſadors had paſſed twiſe or thriſe betweene them and vs, they concluded to obſerue the treatie made the yeere before, and to giue the Duke a certaine ſum of money, for the performance of the which conditions, better than the former, they promiſed to deliuer to the Earle by eight of the clock the next morning three hundred hoſtages, <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP1.NOTE6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> named in a role by their Biſhop and certaine of his ſeruants being in our campe. This night our army was in great trouble and feare, for our campe was neither forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nor incloſed, beſides that, we lay ſcattered heere and there, and in a place much for the Liegeois aduantage, who were all footemen, and knew the countrey better then we. Some of them deſired to aſſaile vs, and in mine opinion if they had ſo done, they mought eaſely haue defeated vs, but their ambaſſadors that intreated for peace brake off that enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>By breake of day our army was come togither, and our battailes ſtoode in very good order, our force was great. For we were three thouſand men of armes good &amp; bad, and twelue or thirteene thouſand archers, beſides great force of footemen, of the countries thereabout. We marched ſtraight vpon our enimies with intent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receaue the hoſtages, or giue them battell if they refuſed to deliuer them. We found them ſeuered into ſmall bands, and in great diſorder, as a people obedient to no mans commandement. None drew neere, the hoſtages being yet vndeliuered. Wherefore the Earle of Charolois asked the Marſhall of Burgundy there preſent, whether he ſhould aſſaile them: who anſwered yea, alledging that they mought now be diſcomfited without danger, and that no conſcience was to be made in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſeeing the fault was theirs. The like aduiſe gaue alſo the Lord of Contay, adding that he ſhould neuer haue them at ſuch aduantage, and ſhewing him how they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7649:32"/>
went ſcattering heere and there in ſmall bands, wherefore he councelled him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther delay to inuade them. But the Earle of Saint Paul conſtable of Fraunce, being asked his aduiſe, was of the contrary opinion, ſaying, that if he aſſailed them, he ſhould do againſt his honor and promiſe, bicauſe ſuch a number of people could not ſo ſoone agree vpon the deliuery of ſo many hoſtages. Wherefore he held it beſt to ſende againe to them to know what they would do. The Earle of Charolois deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this matter long with himſelfe. On the one ſide he ſaw his ancient and mortall enimies defeated without all danger, but on the other he feared the ſtaying of his honor if he ſhould inuade them. In the end he ſent a trumpeter to them, who met with the hoſtages vpon the way, whereupon the wars ended, and euery man retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home, but the ſoldiers were much offended with the Conſtables aduiſe, for they ſawe a goodly booty before them. Incontinent ambaſſadors were ſent to Liege to confirme the peace <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP1.NOTE7">
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref>: but the people being inconſtant and wauering, vaunted that the Earle durſt not fight with them, and diſcharged harquebuſes vpon his ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and entreated them very ill. But the Earle returned into Flaunders, and this ſommer died his father <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP1.NOTE8">

The King was maruellouſly offended with the Dukes of Britaine and Burgundie, by meanes whereof they could hardly heare one from another: for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their meſſengers were ſtaied, and in time of war forced to go by ſea out of Britaine into Flaunders, at the leaſt to paſſe out of Britaine into England, and ſo to trauel by land to Douer, and there to croſſe ouer to Calice: for they could not paſſe the next way through Fraunce without great danger. But during all the ſpace of twenty yeeres or more, that theſe princes were at variance, ſomtime in open war, and ſomtime in a diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled truce, wherein each party comprehended their confederates: God ſhewed ſo great fauor to the realme of Fraunce, that the ciuill wars in England were not yet fully ended, notwithſtanding that they began fifteene yeeres before, and had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with cruell and bloodie battels, wherein many a good man loſt his life. For you ſhall vnderſtand, that there were in England two houſes that claimed the crowne, to wit, Lancaſter and Yorke: for the which cauſe both the parties proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their enimies traitors, and the diuiſion of theſe two houſes was the preſeruation of the eſtate of Fraunce: for doubt you not but that this realme had ſuſtained great troubles if the Engliſh men had been in ſuch eſtate then as in times paſt. But to returne againe to our matter, the Kings chiefe deſire was to conquer Britaine, both bicauſe it ſeemed eaſier to be ſubdued, and of leſſe defence than this houſe of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, and alſo bicauſe the Britons receiued all his euill willers, namely his brother, and other his enimies that had intelligence in his realme. Wherefore he practiſed continually with the Duke of Burgundy, making him diuers offers if he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Britons, and namely that he would in like maner abandon the Liegeois, and all other the Dukes enimies. Whereunto the Duke of Burgundy would not agree, but made a new voiage againſt the Liegeois, bicauſe they had againe broken the peace, and taken and ſpoiled a towne called Huy <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP2.NOTE1">

The Duke leuied his armie about Louuain in Brabant, and vpon the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Liege, whither came to him from the King the Earle of Saint Paule Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of Fraunce (now become altogither French, and reſident continually with the King) accompanied with Cardinall <hi>Balne</hi> and others, who aduertiſed him that the Liegeois were the Kings confederates, and comprehended in the truce: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King would ſuccour them if he inuaded them. Notwithſtanding they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red if he would abandon the Dukes of Berry and Britaine to the King, that the King would then abandon the Liegeois to him.

the Liegeois with breach of the peace, alledging that they had inuaded his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherefore he ſawe no reaſon why he ſhould not be reuenged on them without forſaking his confederates, and this was his anſwer for that time. Againe the next day after their arriuall, the Duke being ready to take horſe, tolde them that he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſought the King to attempt nothing againſt the Duke of Britaine, whereunto the Conſtable replied and ſaid, ſir you chooſe not but take all, for you will make war at your pleaſure vpon your friends, and conſtraine vs to lie ſtill and not inuade our enimies as you do yours, it may not be ſo, neither will the King endure it. Then the Duke taking his leaue ſaid thus again, the Liegeois are aſſembled togither, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three d↑ies I looke for the battell, if I be ouerthrowne, I am ſure you will do after your accuſtomed maner: but if the victory fall on my ſide, the Britaines ſhall liue quietly enough by you. Which talke ended, he mounted on horſebacke, and the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors repaired to their lodgings, to make them ready to depart. The Duke mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in armes from Louuaine with great force, &amp; laid his ſiege before a town called Sainctron, his power was maruellous great, for all the ſtrength of Burgundy was come to him, ſo that this army was far greater than any other that I had ſeene with him before.</p>
               <p>A litle before his departure, he debated with his counſell, whether he ſhould put the Liegeois hoſtages to death, or what he ſhould do with them. Some gaue aduiſe to kill them all, eſpecially the Lord of Contay ſo often aboue mentioned, whom I neuer heard ſpeake ſo cruelly as at that preſent. Wherfore it is neceſſary for a Prince to haue more than one of his counſell, for the wiſeſt erre, yea, and that often. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles bicauſe they are partiall to the matters debated, through hatred or loue, ſomtime bicauſe they ſeeke to contrary ſome one that hath ſpoken before them, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible alſo their bodies may be euill diſpoſed, for it is not to be held for counſell that is giuen after dinner. But you will ſay, that men ſubiect to ſuch imperfections are vnfit to be of a Princes councill, whereunto I anſwer, that we are all men, and that who ſo will haue no councillors but ſuch as neuer faile to ſpeake wiſely, nor are more troubled at one time then another, muſt ſeeke them in heauen, for he ſhall not finde them on earth. But for redreſſe of this inconuenience, ſomtime one of the councell will ſpeake very well and wiſely, that vſeth not often ſo to do, and thus the one ſupplieth the others defects. Now to return to the matter debated in this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, two or three were of the ſaid Contais opinion, mooued thereunto by his great authority &amp; wiſdome: for in ſuch aſſemblies a great number giue their opinion but as they haue heard ſome other ſpeake before them, not vnderſtanding the matters debated, but ſeeking onely to flatter ſome one being of credit and authority that hath already ſpoken.</p>
               <p>After this the Lord of Himbercourt, a gentleman borne neere to Amiens, and one of the wiſeſt knights that euer I knew, being asked his aduiſe ſaid, that to the end the Duke might haue God on his ſide, and diſcharge himſelfe of cruelty and deſire of reuenge before the world: he thought it beſt to pardon all thoſe hoſtages, conſidering they came thither with a good intent, ſuppoſing the treatie ſhould haue been obſerued, notwithſtanding he aduiſed the Duke at their departure to giue them to vnderſtand, how great grace and fauor he ſhewed them, and to deſire them to do their endeuor in perſwading their citizens to peace, which if they could not obtain, yet at the leaſt they themſelues acknowledging his goodnes towards them, ſhould neuer after beare armes neither againſt him, nor their biſhop there preſent with him. This opinion tooke place, and the hoſtages when they were deliuered promiſed to do as the Duke required. Farther this was told them at their departure, that if any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7649:34"/>
of them were herafter taken in armes againſt the Duke, he ſhould die and thus they were diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p>It is not amiſſe to reherſe heere how after Monſeur de Contayes cruell ſentence pronounced againſt the hoſtages: (part of them which were come thither with a good meaning and vpon verie ſimplicitie,) one of the Counſell ſaid thus to me in mine eare: Marke well this man, his bodie is healthfull ynough, though he be old: yet dare I laie a good wager he ſhall not liue a yeere to an end, bicauſe of this cruell ſentence he hath giuen, and ſure ſo it fell out, for he liued not long after. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding before his death he did his Maſter good ſeruice in the battell againſt the Liegeois, wherof you ſhall now heare.</p>
               <p>I haue made mention before how the Duke departing from Louuain, laide his ſiege before Sainctron, and bent his artillerie againſt it. Within the towne were three thouſand Liegeois vnder the charge of a valiant knight, the ſelfe ſame that was their chiefe commiſſioner for peace when we met them in order of battell the yeere before. But the third day after the Dukes arriuall before the towne, the Liegeois with great force came to leuie his ſiege about ten of the clocke in the morning, they were thirtie thouſand men <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP2.NOTE2">

                  </ref> and aboue good and bad, all footmen ſaue fine hundred. They were well furniſhed of artillerie, and encamped within halfe a league of vs in a ſtrong village called Breton, part whereof was enuironed with a mariſh. Farther Francois Royet, Baillif of Lions, and the Kings ambaſſador at that time to the ſaide Liegeois, was with them in their armie. <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP2.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> Our fourragers were the firſt that aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed vs of their arriuall, for we had no ſcoutes abroade, which was a foule ouerſight: I neuer was in place with the Duke of Burgundie where I ſaw him giue good order of him ſelfe but this daie onely. Incontinent he raunged all his battels in the fielde, ſaue certeine bands appointed to lie ſtill at the ſiege, among the which were fiue or ſixe hundred Engliſh men. Farther he beſet both the ſides of the village with twelue hundred men of armes, and placed him ſelfe with eight hundred men of armes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlie ouer againſt the village, ſomewhat farther off then the reſt: he cauſed alſo a great companie of gentlemen and men of armes to light on foote with the archers, &amp; then the L. of Rauaſtain with the vaward (being all on foote, as wel men of armes, as archers) marched forward with certeine peeces of artillerie euen hard to the Lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geois trenches which were broad, deepe, &amp; full of water: yet notwithſtanding with force of arrowes and cannot ſhot, the enimies were repulſed, and their trenches wonne, and their artillerie alſo: but when our ſhot failed vs, the Liegeois recouered their ſpirits and with their long pikes gaue a charge vpon our archers and their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, of whom they ſlew in a moment foure or fiue hundred, in ſuch ſort that all our enſignes begane to wauer as men halfe diſcomfited. At which inſtant the Duke commanded the archers of his battell to march, being led by <hi>Philip</hi> of Creuecoeur, Lord of Cordes (a wiſe gentleman) and diuers other valiantmen, who ſo couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſailed the enimies, that with the turning of a hand they were put to flight. But neither the horſemen aboue mentioned that ſtood on both ſides of the village, neither the Duke himſelfe could follow the chaſe bicauſe of the mariſh: for they were placed there onely to this end, that if the Liegeois had broken the D. vawarde, and iſſued foorth of their trenches into the plaine, they might then haue giuen a charge vpon them. The Liegeois fled along through the mariſh, being purſued onely by our footmen, notwithſtanding the Duke ſent part of the horſemen that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied himſelfe to follow the chaſe, but they were forced to ride two leagues about before they could finde any paſſage, by meanes whereof they were benighted, which ſaued many a Liegeois life. The reſt of his horſemen the Duke ſent to his campe,

In this battell were ſlaine 9000. men, <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP2.NOTE4">

                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> the Duke when it was darke night returned with the whole armie into his campe, ſaue a thouſand or twelue hundred horſe that were gone two leagues about to follow the chaſe, for otherwiſe they could not come neere their enimies bicauſe of a litle riuer that was to paſſe. They did no great exploit bicauſe of the night: notwithſtanding ſome of their enimies they ſlew, and ſome they tooke, but the greateſt part eſcaped into the citie. The Lord of Contay did good ſeruice this day in giuing order in the battell, &amp; died ſhortlie after in the town of Huz and made a good end: he was a wiſe &amp; a valiant knight, but liued not long after his cruel ſentence pronounced againſt the hoſtages aboue mentioned. The D. immediatlie after he was vnarmed called one of his ſecretaries, and wrote a letter to the Conſtable and the other ambaſſadors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him at Louuain not aboue foure daies before, wherein he aduertiſed them of his victorie and deſired them to attempt nothing againſt the Bretons.</p>
               <p>Within two daies after the battell, the pride of this fooliſh people was cleane abated, though their loſſe were not great: whereby appeereth how dangerous a thing it is for any Prince to hazard his eſtate in battell, if he may by anie other means make a good end, for a ſmal loſſe in a battel changeth &amp; altereth the minds of his ſubiects that receiueth the ouerthrow more than any man would thinke, cauſing them not only to ſtand in great feare of their enimies, but alſo to deſpiſe &amp; contemn their Prince and thoſe that are in authority about him, yea to murmur and practiſe againſt him. They demand boldlier than they were accuſtomed, and ſtorme if ought be denied them, ſo that the Prince mought haue done more with one crowne before the battell, than with three after it. Wherefore if he that hath receaued the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe be wiſe, he will not aduenture a ſecond battell in this eſtate with thoſe that haue fled, but onely defend his owne, and ſeeke ſome ſmall enterpriſe eaſie to be atchiued, to the end thereby his ſubiects may recouer their former courage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue all feare. To conclude, the loſſe of a battell traineth with it a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences to him that is vanquiſhed. Notwithſtanding great conquerors haue iuſt cauſe to deſire the battell to abridge their labours, as haue alſo the Engliſhmen and Switzers, both bicauſe they are better footemen then their neighbors, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the great victories they haue obteined, (which notwithſtanding, I write not to the diſpraiſe of other nations) and alſo bicauſe their men can not keepe the fields long without dooing ſome exploit, as Frenchmen and Italians can, who alſo are more full of practiſe and eaſier to be gouerned than they. Now on the otherſide, he that obtaineth the victory, increaſeth his honor and eſtimation, his ſubiects are the more obedient, they deny him nothing that he demandeth, his ſoldiers alſo waxe thereby the hardier, and the more couragious. Notwithſtanding oftentimes the Princes themſelues after a victory obteined, are ſo puffed vp with pride and vaine glory, that commonly their good ſucceſſe turneth to their harme, all the which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by Gods diſpoſition, who ſendeth alterations according to mens deſerts.</p>
               <p>When they within Sainctron ſaw the battell loſt, and themſelues incloſed on all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7649:35"/>
ſides, ſuppoſing alſo the diſcomfiture to be much greater then indeede it was: they laid downe their armor, yeelded the towne, and deliuered ſuch men to the Dukes mercy as he demanded, whom he incontinent cauſed to be beheaded, ſixe of them being of the hoſtages that he had diſmiſſed a few daies before, vnder ſuch conditions as you haue heard. From thence he diſlodged and marched to Tongres, which abode the ſiege: but bicauſe the towne was nothing ſtrong, they yeelded before the battery vnder the ſame conditions that their neighbors of Sainctron had accepted, and deliuered alſo ten men to the Duke, who were put to death as the former, fiue or ſixe of them being likewiſe of the hoſtages aboue mentioned.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom Tongres the Duke marched to the citie of Liege, where the people were in great diuiſion, for part of them gaue aduiſe to defend the towne: ſaying that they had force ſufficient within it ſo to do, the cheife of the which faction was a knight called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Raz</hi> of Laitre, but others ſeeing all the countrey about bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deſtroied, would in any wiſe haue peace, were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions neuer ſo vnreſonable: wherefore when the Duke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched neere to the city, diuers ouertures of peace were made by certaine meane perſons, as priſoners and ſuch like. But the principall dealers in the matter were certaine of our hoſtages, who doing cleane contrary to the others aboue mentioned, and acknowledging the great fauor the Duke had ſhewed them, brought to his campe with them three hundred of the beſt citizens in their ſhirts, bare headed, &amp; bare legged, who preſented the keies of the city to him, and yeelded themſelues to his mercy, humbly beſeching him onely to giue them his word, that the towne ſhould neither be fired nor ſacked. And at the ſelfe ſame time that they came in this eſtate to the Duke, the Kings ambaſſadors being Monſeur de Mouy, and a ſecretary called <hi>Iohn Preuoſt</hi> were there preſent, who were come to the Duke with the ſame demandes that the Conſtable had made a few daies before. Farther the verie day of the compoſition, the Duke ſuppoſing to enter the citie, ſent the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7649:35"/>
Lord of Hymbercourt thither before him bicauſe he was well acquainted in the towne, and had beene gouernor thereof vnder Duke <hi>Philip</hi> during the yeeres they liued in peace: notwithſtanding entrie was denied him for that day, whereupon he retired and lodged in an abbey without one of the towne gates, being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with fiftie men of armes, the whole number amounting to two hundred ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and I my ſelfe being one of them. The Duke of Burgundie ſent him word if the place where he laie were ſtrong not to diſlodge, otherwiſe to retire backe to him, for he could hardlie haue ſuccoured him bicauſe all that countrey is rock and ſtone. The ſaid Hymbercourt reſolued not to mooue (for the place was very ſtrong,) but retained with him fiue or ſixe of the citizens that brought the keies to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Duke, minding to vſe their helpe to good purpoſe, as heereafter you ſhall peceiue. At nine of the clock at night we heard a bell ring, at the ſound whereof the citizens vſe to aſſemble, whereupon the ſaid Hymbercourt, doubted that this bell called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie togither to iſſue foorth to aſſaile vs, (for he was aduertiſed that Maſter <hi>Raz</hi> of Laitre and other of the citizens would not agree to peace,) and in deed his ſurmiſe was true, for that was their determination, and they were euen vpon the pointe to ſally. Then ſaid the Lord of Hymbercourt to vs, if we can dalie with them but till midnight, we are ſafe, for they will waxe wearie and deſirous of ſleepe, and then thoſe that are our enimies in the towne will flie when they ſhall ſee their enterpriſe fruſtrate: wherefore to bring his purpoſe to paſſe, he diſpatched two of the citizens that he had ſtaied with him, and deliuered them certeine freindly articles in writing, meaning only to buſie the citizens with farther talke to win time: for their maner was &amp; yet is to aſſemble togither at the Biſhops pallace to debate of their affaires, when the bel aboue mentioned is rung. Theſe two Burgeſſes which had been of our hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, when they came to the gate being hardlie two bow ſhot from the abbey where we lodged: found a great number of the citizens there in armes, ſome of the which would needs iſſue foorth to aſſaile vs, &amp; ſome not. Then our two Burgeſſes tould the Maior of the citie aloude, that they brought certeine friendly articles in writing from the Lord of Hymbercourt the Duke of Burgundies lieutenant in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis, willing him to returne to the pallace to read them, whereunto he agreed, and incontinent we heard the bell ring againe, wherby we vnderſtood that they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied about our articles. Our two Burgeſſes returned not, but about an hower after we heard a greater noiſe at the gate than before, and a much greater number came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in armes, crying and rayling vpon vs from the wals, whereby the Lord of Hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercourt perceiued our danger to be now rather increaſed then diminiſhed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he diſpatched the other fower hoſtages that were yet with him, by whom he wrote a letter, the contents whereof were that during the time he was gouernor of the citie, for the Duke of Burgundie, he had vſed them gentlie and louinglie, neither would for anie thing conſent to their deſtruction, eſpecially ſeeing not long before he had beene a commoner of one of their companies in the towne, namely the Goldſmithes companie: <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP3.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> wherefore they ought ſo much the rather to credit his words. To be ſhort he ſaid if they would obteine peace, and ſaue their countrey, they moſt firſt receiue the Duke into the towne according to their promiſe, and then ſubſcribe to certeine articles written in the ſcedule he there ſent them. After he had well inſtructed theſe foure hoſtages, they went to the gate as did the former, which they found wide open. Some of the citizens welcommed them with ſharpe words, but others were content to heare their meſſage. To be ſhort in the end they returned againe to the pallace, immediatlie wherupon we heard the bell ring which much comforted vs, and by litle &amp; litle, the noiſe that was at the gate ceaſed. They
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7649:36"/>
were togither in the palace till two of the clock after midnight, and in the end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to keepe the compoſition they had made, &amp; the next morning to deliuer one of the towne gates to the Lord of Hymbercourt: whereupon incontinent Maſter <hi>Raz</hi> of Laitre and his whole faction fled out of the towne.</p>
               <p>I would not haue ſtoode ſo long vpon this point being of ſo ſmall importance, had it not beene to declare that by ſuch fine deuiſes proceeding of deepe wiſdome, great perils, dangers, &amp; loſſes are often eſchewed. The next morning by day breake, a number of the hoſtages came to the Lord of Hymbercourt, deſiring him to come to the palace where all the people were aſſembled, there to aſſure them by his oth of the two points they doubted of: to wit the firing and ſacking of the towne, which being done, they promiſed to put one of the gates into his hands: whereof he ſent word to the Duke, and then accompanied them to the palace, where after he had ſworne as they demanded, he returned to the gate. And the citizens commanded the ſoldiers that were vpon it to come downe, and he put into it twelue men of armes, and certaine archers, and reared vp the Duke of Burgundies enſigne. From thence hee went to another walled gate, into the which he put the baſtard of Burgundy, who lay neere at hand. Into the third he put the Marſhall of Burgundy, and into the fourth certain gentlemen that were with himſelfe, and thus were fower gates well manned with Burgundians, and the Dukes enſignes vpon them.</p>
               <p>Now you ſhall vnderſtand, that at that time the citie of Liege was one of the mightieſt and moſt populous townes in thoſe quarters, except fower or fiue, beſides that, a great multitude of the people of the countrey round about was retired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that their loſſe in the battell was no whit perceaued. Farther they were well furniſhed of all things, and it was the deepe of winter when we came before the towne, the weather was maruellous foule, and the ground woonderfull ſoft and mirie. We on the other ſide were in great diſtreſſe both of vitailes and money, and our army in a maner broken. Wherefore the Duke had no purpoſe to beſiege the city, neither could he though he would, and if they had ſtaied the compoſition but two daies longer, he was fully reſolued to returne home. Wherefore I may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the great honor he obteined in this voiage proceeded of the meere grace of God, contrary to mans expectation: for he durſt hardly haue craued at Gods hands the good ſucceſſe he gaue him, which great honor and godly victory in the iudgement of all vertuous and wiſe men hapned to him, for the fauor and mercy ſhewed to the hoſtages aboue mentioned. This I write bicauſe both Princes and others oftentimes finde fault as it were with themſelues, when they haue don a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or a good turne to a man, ſaying, that they were accurſed when they did it, &amp; will beware heerafter how they pardon ſo lightly, how they beſtow any ſuch benefit, or ſhew any ſuch fauor to any man, which notwithſtanding, are things incident to their office. Wherefore in mine opinion this is euill ſpoken, and proceedeth of a baſe and abiect minde: for a Prince or any other man that neuer was deceaued, can be but a beaſt, bicauſe he vnderſtandeth not the difference betweene good and euill. Beſides that, all men are not of one diſpoſition, and it is no reaſon for the naughtines of one or two to ceaſe from doing good to a great number, when time and occaſion ſerueth. Notwithſtanding I wiſh Princes to make good choiſe of thoſe they benefit, for all men deſerue not alike. But me thinke it almoſt impoſſible for a wiſe man to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, or vnmindfull of a good turne, and if Princes beſtow vpon fooles, they are woorſe than mad, for they ſhall perceaue in the end that a fooles acquaintance can ſtand them in no ſteede. Farther in mine opinion, this is the greateſt point of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in a Prince to haue neere about him wiſe and vertuous men: for himſelfe ſhall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7649:36"/>
be iudged to be of the nature and diſpoſition of thoſe that are moſt familiar with him. Wherefore to conclude this diſcourſe, me thinke we ought neuer to be wearie of well dooing: for one man alone, yea the meaneſt of thoſe we haue pleaſured, may happily ſo requite our friendſhip, that he ſhal recompence the ingratitude of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as appeered by theſe hoſtages, the greateſt part wherof, were ingrate and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, but ſome of them acknowledged and requited the benefit receaued: for by the onely means of fiue or ſix of them, this enterpriſe was atchiued, which turned ſo greatly to the Duke of Burgundies honor and profit.</p>

The Duke himſelfe entred on horſebacke, accompanied with all his houſhold ſeruants, and the nobleſt men in his armie, clad and apparelled the moſt ſumptuouſly that might be: and in this eſtate rode he through the towne, and lighted at the great Church. To be ſhort, he abode there certaine daies, and put to death fiue or ſixe more of his hoſtages that had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken promiſe, and with them the towne meſſenger whom he hated extremely: he eſtabliſhed certaine new lawes and cuſtomes, and commanded a great ſumme of mony to be leuied in the citie, which he ſaid was forfeited to him for the treaties and compoſitions broken the yeeres before. Farther, he caried away all their artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and armour, and raſed all their gates and wals.</p>
               <p>This done he returned into his owne countries where he was honorably and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully receiued eſpecially of the citizens of Gaunt, who before his voiage to Liege had after a ſort rebelled againſt him with certaine other townes, but now they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him as a conqueror, with ſo great lowlines and humilitie, that certaine of the beſt citizens came on foote to him as far as Bruxels, bringing with them all the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their towne, which they did for this cauſe: Immediately after his fathers death he choſe the city of Gaunt for the firſt towne he would make his entrie into: for ſuppoſing that to be the towne where he was beſt beloued, and therefore looking for all dutie and obedience at their hands: he hoped alſo by that meanes to finde the like in all the other townes of his dominions, aſſuring himſelfe that they would all follow the example of this, which opinion prooued true as touching this latter point. But you ſhall vnderſtand that the next day after his entrie, they came in armes vpon the market place, bringing with them a Saint called Saint Lieuin, with whoſe ſhrine they beat downe a little houſe called La Cueillette: where a cuſtome of corne was

                  </ref>, for two yeeres they had been in wars with him. To be ſhort, they ſaide this Saint would paſſe through this houſe without ſtouping, and in a moment beate downe the houſe, which diſorder the Duke ſeeing, went himſelfe to the market place: a great number of noble men in armes offering to waite vpon him as he paſſed through the ſtreetes, which he refuſed, commanding them to ſtay before the towne-houſe, and attende him there. Notwithſtanding, by litle and litle the throng of people forced them at length into the market place alſo, whither when the Duke came, he went vp into a houſe to ſpeake to theſe rebels, commanding them to take vp the ſhrine and beare it into the church, which ſome obediently did, but others cauſed it to be laid downe againe. Then they preſented ſupplications to him againſt certaine of the towne, touching paiments of money, wherein he promiſed to do iuſtice. But when he ſawe they would not depart, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his lodging, and they abode in armes vpon the market place the ſpace of eight daies. The next morning they brought articles to him, demanding the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all their priuiledges that Duke <hi>Philip</hi> had taken from them by the treatie of Gaures, of this one eſpecially, that euery company in the town (being threeſcore and twelue in all) might haue a banner according to their ancient cuſtom. The Duke ſeeing the danger he ſtood in, granted them all their demands, and all ſuch priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges as they required, which word was no ſooner paſſed him, but they reared vp all their banners vpon the market place, being all readie made, whereby appeered that they would haue had them perforce, if he had not granted them. His opinion at his firſt entry into Gaunt prooued true, that all the other townes would follow their example: for indeede diuers rebelled as the towne of Gaunt did, ſlew his officers, and committed diuers other diſorders. But if he had beleeued his fathers prouerbe, that the citizens of Gaunt loue their Princes ſonne well, but their Prince neuer, he had not been deceaued, and to ſay the truth, next to the citizens' of Liege theſe of Gaunt are the moſt inconſtant in the world. Notwithſtanding, one good property they haue among ſo many bad, that they neuer lay hands vpon their Princes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP4.NOTE3">

               <p>The Duke was forced to digeſt and winke at all theſe rebellions, fearing to enter into a dooble war at one time with his owne ſubiects, and the Liegeois. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his meaning was if he ſped well in his voiage to Liege, to teach them their duty at his returne, as alſo it hapned, for as I haue already made mention, they brought to him on foote to Bruxels, all their banners, priuiledges, and writings, as well thoſe they made him grant at his departure from Gaunt as others, all the which in a great aſſembly held in the hall of Bruxels, in the preſence of diuers ambaſſadors they preſented to him, to do with them at his pleaſure. Than the Haralts of armes by his commandement, tooke the ſaid banners from the ſtaues whereto they were faſtned, and carried them to Bullen, a hauen towne eight leagues from Calis, where the other banners yet remained that D. <hi>Philip</hi> his father tooke from them, when the wars ended, wherein he vanquiſhed and ſubdued them. Farther the Duke Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor tooke all their priuiledges, and rent one of them concerning the election of their Senate: for in all the other townes of Flaunders, the Prince euerie yeere cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Senate, and receiueth their accounts, but by this priuiledge he might choſe but foure in Gaunt, and the reſt being two and twenty they themſelues choſe: when the Senators of the townes are freinds and faithfull ſubiects to their Prince, he liueth that yeere in peace, and they willingly graunt him all his demands: but if
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7649:37"/>
they be otherwiſe, commonly ſome rebellion happeneth. Laſtlie the citizens of Gaunt paied the Duke thirtie thouſand gildons and ſixe thouſand to his principall ſeruants, and baniſhed certeine out of their towne, but all their other priuileges were reſtored them, the reſt of the townes bought alſo their peace with money, for they had attempted no great matter againſt the Duke.</p>
               <p>By this example a man may perceiue how great good enſueth victorie in a battell and how many inconueniences the ouerthrow. Wherfore a Prince ought to beware how he hazard his eſtate vpon a day vnleſſe neceſſitie force him thereunto: and if that happen, then muſt he bethinke him ſelfe before the hower of all doubts and dangers that may be imagined. For thoſe that feare a matter commonly prouide well for it, and haue oftener good ſucceſſe than they that proceede with a careleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: vnleſſe God be fully reſolued to ſtrike the ſtroke, againſt whom mans wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cannot preuaile. Which point is ſufficiently prooued by the example of theſe Liegeois aboue mentioned, who had been excommunicated the ſpace of fiue yeeres for their variance with their Biſhop, whereof notwithſtanding they made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but continued ſtill in their folly and naughtines, mooued thereunto onely through wealth and pride.

The King tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilled continually with the Duke of Burgundie to ſuffer him to inuade Britaine at his pleaſure, making him diuers offers in conſideration thereof: whereunto the Duke would not condeſcend, for the which cauſe partly, and partly

for the ouerthrow giuen to the Liegeois his confederates, the Kings diſpleaſure was ſo kindled that longer he could not forbeare, but in the very beginning of ſommer entred into Britaine, at the leaſt his forces for him, and tooke two ſmall caſtels, the one called Chantoſſe, the other Anſeny, whereof the Duke of Burgundy was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent aduertiſed, and earneſtly preſſed by the Dukes of Normandy and Britaine with all ſpeede to leuie his armie for their aide, whereupon he wrote to the King, humbly beſeeching him to relinquiſh his enterpriſe, ſeeing theſe two Dukes were comprehended in the truce as his confederates, but receiuing ſuch anſwer as liked him not, he encamped with great force neere to Peronne. The Kings army was ſtill in Britaine, but the Court lay at Compiegne, from whence the King ſent Cardinall <hi>Balue</hi> to the Duke within three daies after his arriuall at Peronne, who ſtaied not long with him, but made certaine ouertures of peace, aduertiſing him alſo that they in Britaine could make their compoſition welll ynough without him, for the Kings drift was to ſeuer them. The Cardinall was honorably receiued, well feaſted, and ſoone diſpatched, and returned with this anſwere, that the Duke was not come forth into the field to endammage the King in any reſpect, but onely to ſuccour his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates: ſo the meſſages that paſſed betweene them were very courteous on both ſides.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Cardinals departure a heralt called <hi>Bretaigne</hi> arriued at the Duke of Burgundies campe with letters from the Dukes of Normandie and Britain, wherin they aduertiſed him that they had made peace with the King, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all leagues and confederacies, and namely their league with him, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the Duke of Normandie had ſurrendred Normandie (lately giuen him for his partage) to the King, and ſhould receiue in recompence thereof, and of all other partages the yeerely reuenues of three ſcore thouſand franks, which conditions (though neuer ſo vnreaſonable) neceſſitie forced the Lord <hi>Charles</hi> of Fraunce to accept. The Duke of Burgundie was woonderfully abaſhed at theſe newes: for he had put himſelfe into the field onely to aide the ſaid Dukes. And ſure the heralt was in great danger, for bicauſe he paſſed by the Court, the Duke ſuſpected that the King had forged theſe letters, notwithſtanding he receiued immediately after, the like aduertiſement from other places. The King thought now his enterpriſe halfe woon, and that he ſhould eaſily perſwade the Duke of Burgundie to forſake theſe two Dukes, as they had him: whereupon ſecret meſſengers ran betweene them, and the King gaue the Duke ſixe ſcore thouſand crownes, whereof he paid the one halfe preſently the better to content the ſaid Duke, who had conſumed great ſummes in leuying this armie. Farther, the Duke ſent to the King a groome of his chamber very neere about him, named <hi>Iohn Vobriſſet,</hi> whereupon the King conceiued great hope of his enterpriſe, and ſeemed deſirous to commune with the Duke in perſon, truſting to obtaine of him all that he required, both bicauſe of the two foreſaid Dukes ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards him, and alſo bicauſe of the great ſumme of monie he had giuen him. Wherefore he aduertiſed the Duke of certaine matters by the ſaid <hi>Vobriſſet,</hi> and ſent backe with him Cardinall <hi>Balue</hi> and Maſter <hi>Tanneguy du Chaſtell</hi> gouernor of <hi>Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillon,</hi> who gaue the Duke to vnderſtand by their words, that the King deſired greatly that they two might commune togither in perſon.</p>
               <p>They found the Duke at Peronne who ſeemed to haue no great deuotion to this meeting, bicauſe the Liegeois made ſhew as though they would rebell anew, being ſollicited thereunto by two ambaſſadors ſent thither by the King for that purpoſe before the truce was made which he and the Duke concluded, for certaine daies betweene them and their confederates. But Cardinall <hi>Balue</hi> and the other ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7649:38"/>
put this doubt out of his head, alleaging that the Liegeois durſt attempt no ſuch thing, conſidering he had vanquiſhed them, &amp; raſed but their wals the yeer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and farther, if they had any ſuch deſire, yet when they ſhould ſee this amitie betweene him and the King, they would ſoone alter their mindes. Thus in the end it was concluded that the King ſhould come to Peronne ſeeing it pleaſed him ſo to do, and the Duke ſent him a letter written with his owne hand, containing ſufficient ſuretie to come and go at his pleaſure. And thus departed the ambaſſadors, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the King being then at Noyon. But the Duke minding to make all ſure in the countrie of Liege, ſent thither their Biſhop for whoſe quarrell all the wars aboue mentioned firſt began, and in his company the Lord of Hymbercourt (the Dukes lieutenant in thoſe parts) with certaine bands of men.</p>
               <p>You haue heard how it was concluded that the King ſhould come to Peronne, according to the which determination thither he came without his garde, for his pleaſure was wholy to put himſelfe vnder the garde and ſuretie of the Duke, and that Monſeur de Cordes (who then ſerued the Duke) ſhould conuay him thither with the ſaid Dukes archers which was done accordingly. The Kings traine was very ſmall, notwithſtanding he came accompanied with diuers noble perſonages, namely, the Duke of Bourbon, the Cardinall his brother, and the Earle of Saint Paule Conſtable of Fraunce, who had not buſied himſelfe about this meeting but much miſliked it. For he was now waxed proud and high minded, and behaued not himſelfe to the Duke of Burgundie with ſuch lowlines and humilitie as he was accuſtomed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no good will betweene them twaine. Thither came alſo Cardinall <hi>Balue</hi> the gouernor of Rouſſillon, and diuers others. And when the King drew neere to Peronne, the Duke with a goodly traine iſſued foorth to receiue him, and brought him into the towne, and lodged him in a goodly houſe neere to the caſtell being the receiuers, for the caſtell was a little old thing naught woorth.</p>
               <p>War betweene two great Princes is eaſily begun but hardly ended, bicauſe of the number of accidents depending thereupon: for each partie diſpatcheth meſſengers to and fro to hurt his enimie, which ſuddenly cannot be ſtaied nor reuoked, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered by theſe two Princes, who concluded this meeting vpon a ſudden not aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing their ſeruants thereof, who were far from them executing the charge their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters had giuen them. For you ſhall vnderſtand that the Duke had ſent for his armie into Burgundie, being furniſhed at that time with a number of gentlemen, namely the Lord of Breſſe of the houſe of Sauoy, &amp; his two brethren the Biſhop of Geneua, and the Earle of Remont: for the Sauoyans and Burgundians haue euer borne great loue one to another. In this armie were alſo certaine Almaines borderers vpon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy and the county of Burgundy. Now you ſhall vnderſtand that the King in times paſt had held the Lord of Breſſe in priſon, bicauſe of two Knights he commanded to be ſlaine in Sauoy, wherefore there was no good will betweene them two. In this armie were alſo the Lord of Vrfé, Maſter of the horſe afterward to King <hi>Charles,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Poncet</hi> of Riuiere, and the Lord of Lau, whom the King after ſpeciall good liking of him had alſo held long in priſon, but he eſcaped and fled into Burgundy. All this company aboue mentioned arriued neere to Peronne, euen at the very inſtant that the King came thither, and the Lord of Breſſe with the three aboue mentioned, euery one of them wearing the Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> croſſe entred the towne, ſuppoſing they had come time ynough to accompanie the Duke when he ſhould go to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the King, but bicauſe they came too late they went ſtraight to the Dukes chamber to do their dutie to him, where the Lord of Breſſe humbly beſought him that the three aboue named, notwithſtanding the Kings comming, might be there
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7649:39"/>
vnder his ſafegard and protection, as he had promiſed them in Burgundie at their firſt arriuall into his dominions, adding that they were ready to ſerue him againſt all men none excepted: which requeſt the Duke granted with his owne mouth, and for their good wil thanked them. The reſt of this army (led by the Marſhal of Burgundy) lodged without the towne as they were appointed. The ſaid Marſhall hated the King no leſſe than the others aboue named, bicauſe of Pinall a towne in Lorraine which the King had once giuen him, and afterward taken from him to beſtow vpon <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Calabria ſo often mentioned in this hiſtorie.

For our life is ſo ſhort that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience cannot ſufficiently inſtruct vs, conſiderlng withal that our yeers are abridged, and neither our liues ſo long, nor our bodies ſo ſtrong, as were our anceſters in ages paſt: which way as we are weakned, ſo is our faith alſo each to other much dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP6.NOTE2">

               <head>How and for what cauſe the King was ſtaied and held priſoner in the caſtell of Peronne by the Duke of Burgundies commandement. Chap. 7.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard how the King and this army of Burgundie arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at Peronne both in one iſtant, for the Duke could not countermand them in time, bicauſe they were well forward vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way when the Kings comming was firſt communed of. Their arriuall troubled the feaſt, bicauſe of diuers doubts that ſprang thereof. Notwithſtanding theſe two Princes appointed certeine of their ſeruants to negotiate togither about their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, in moſt louing and freindly ſort. But after three or foure daies communication, theſe ſtrange newes came from Liege which I will now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſe. The K. comming to Peronne had cleane forgotten the two ambaſſadors ſent to Liege to ſollicite them to rebell againſt the Duke, who ſo diligently executed their charge, that before the Kings arriuall at Peronne, the Liegeois had leuied great force and were gone to ſurpriſe the towne of Tongres, where the Biſhop of Liege and the Lord of Hymbercourt lodged accompanied with two thouſand men and better: and the ſaid Biſhop and Hymbercourt they tooke with certein other of the Biſhops familiar friends, but few they ſlew, neither was the number of the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners great: the reſt fled as men diſcomfited, leauing bag and bagage behinde them. This done the Liegeois returned towards their citie not far diſtant from Tongres: and vpon the way thitherward the Lord of Hymbercourt compounded for his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome with a knight called Maſter <hi>VVilliam de Ville,</hi> named by the French <hi>Le Sauuage,</hi> who fearing leſt this furious people ſhould kill him, ſuffered him to depart vpon his word: which notwithſtanding he neuer chalenged, for ſoon after himſelfe was ſlaine: the people reioiced much for the taking of their Biſhop. Farther you ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that they hated extremely certaine chanons of the Church taken priſoners that day: of whom for the firſt repaſt they ſlew fiue or ſixe, one of the which was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Maſter <hi>Robert</hi> the Biſhops ſpeciall friend, whom I my ſelfe haue often ſeene armed at all peeces waiting vpon his Maſter, for ſuch is the maner of the Alemaigne Prelates. <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP7.NOTE1">

                  </ref> The ſaid Maſter <hi>Robert</hi> they ſlew in the Biſhops preſence, and hewed him into a number of ſmall gobbets which they threw one at another in diriſion. To be ſhort, before their returne to Liege which was but eight leagues from Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres, they ſlew ſixteen chanons and others all in maner the Biſhops ſeruants. This
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7649:40"/>
done, they receiued aduertiſement that the treatie betweene the King and the Duke was alreadie begun, wherefore they diſmiſſed certaine Burgundians ſuppoſing to excuſe their fault, by ſeeming to haue attempted nothing againſt the Duke, but only againſt their Biſhop, whom they led priſoner into the citie. Thoſe that eſcaped put all the countrie in an vprore as they went, by means whereof this newes came ſoone to the Duke: ſome ſaid all were ſlaine, others the contrarie, for ſuch aduertiſements are neuer reported after one ſort. At the length certaine arriued that ſaw theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons ſlaine, who ſuppoſing the Biſhop and Hymbercourt to be of the number, auowed conſtantly that all were murthered, and farther, that they ſaw the Kings am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors in the companie, whom alſo they named. All this was told the Duke, who foorthwith beleeued it, and fell into an extreme furie, ſaying that the King was come thither to abuſe him, and gaue commandement to ſhut the gates of the caſtell and the towne, ſpreading a fond rumor that he did it, bicauſe of a budget with iewels and monie that was loſt. The King ſeeing himſelfe ſhut into this little caſtell, and a number of archers before the gate: ſtood in great doubt of his perſon, the rather bicauſe he lodged hard by a great tower, in the which an Earle of Vermandois had in times paſt cauſed a King of Fraunce one of his predeceſſors to be ſlaine <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP7.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>. I was yet in ſeruice with the Duke, and one of his priuie chamber, into the which I entred at my pleaſure, according to the vſe of this houſe of Burgundie. The Duke when the towne gates were ſhut, commanded all men to voide his chamber, and ſaid to two or three of vs that taried with him, that notwithſtanding he for his part had neuer any taſte in this meeting, but agreed to it onely to content the King: yet the King on the contrarie ſide was come thither purpoſely to abuſe him. Then rehearſed he all theſe newes of Liege, how the King had ordered the matter by his ambaſſadors and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all his men to be ſlaine: and ſuch a rage he was in againſt the King, and ſo threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened him, that I thinke verily if thoſe to whom he ſpake had preſſed forward the matter, and counſelled him to worke the King ſome miſchiefe, he would haue done it, at the leaſt haue impriſoned him in the great tower aboue mentioned. None were preſent when theſe words paſſed the Duke, but my ſelfe and two groomes of his chamber, one of the which was named <hi>Charles</hi> of Viſin borne at Dyion, an honeſt gentleman and in good credit with his maſter. We mitigated this matter, and ſought to appeaſe the Duke as much as in vs lay, notwithſtanding ſoone after he vſed alſo the like ſpeech to others, by meanes whereof it was blowen all ouer the towne, and came at length into the Kings chamber, who was in maruellous feare, as vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally all men were, bicauſe of the great euils they ſaw like to enſue a quarrell begun betweene two ſo great Princes, who ſure were both blame woorthie, for that they aduertiſed not their ſeruants of this meeting, who were far from them executing their commandements, whereby ſome great inconuenience was ſure to enſue.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is great folly for two Princes being in manner of equall force and eſtate to meete togither, vnleſſe it be in their youth when their mindes are wholy ſet vpon pleaſures and paſtimes, but after they are come to mans eſtate, and growen deſirous to encroch each vpon other, ſuch enteruiewes do but increaſe their hatred and euill will, though happily their perſons might be there in ſafetie, which notwithſtanding I hold almoſt for a thing impoſſible. Wherefore it is better to pacifie all controuerſies by wiſe and diſcreete men, as before I haue ſaid: for proofe whereof I will reherſe certaine examples that haue happened in my tyme, ſome of the which I my ſelfe haue ſeene, and of the reſt haue beene credibly enformed.</p>
               <p>A few yeers after King <hi>Lewis</hi> his coronation before the war called the WEALE PVBLIQVE began, a ſollemne meeting was appointed between him and the King of Caſtile, <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP8.NOTE1">

To this meeting came <hi>Henry</hi> King of Caſtile with a goodlie traine to Fontarabia, and the King our Maſter to Saint Iohn de Luz fower leagues diſtant, both of them being vpon the frontires of their dominions. I was not preſent my ſelfe at this meeting, but I haue heard both the King and the Lord of Lau make report thereof, and haue beene enformed of it alſo by certaine Lords of Caſtille there preſent with the King their Maſter, who came to this enterview accompanied with the Lord great Maſter of Saint Iames, and the Archbiſhop of Tolledo which two bare all the ſwaie in Caſtile at that time, the Earle of Lodeſme the King of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtils minion was there alſo in great brauerie, and all the ſaid Kings gard, being to the number of three hundred horſe, all Moores of Granado and ſome of them Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gros. But K. <hi>Henry</hi> himſelfe was a man of ſo ſmall vnderſtanding, that he gaue away all his inheritance, at the leaſt ſuffered euery man that would to ſpoile him of it: our King was alſo accompanied with a goodlie traine, as you know his vſe was, but his gard eſpecially was braue &amp; in verie good order. To this meeting came in like maner the Queene of Arragon about a controuerſie betweene hir and the King of Caſtile, for Eſtell and certaine other places in Nauarre: whereof the King was made arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator. But now for proofe that ſuch enterviews between great Princes are not meet nor conuenient, you ſhall vnderſtand that theſe two Kings had neuer beene at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, there was no quarrell betweene them, neither ſaw they one another paſt once or twiſe vpon a riuer ſide that parteth both their realmes, <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP8.NOTE2">

At their firſt meeting they had no great liking one of another, eſpecially our King, who perceiued the King of Caſtille to be but a ſimple man doing nothing of himſelfe, but whollie gouerned by the great Maſter of Saint Iames and the Archbiſhop of Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo

aboue mentioned. Wherefore he made no account of their Maſter but ſought their freindſhip, whereupon they came to him to Saint Iohn de Luz where he entred into amitie with them, and had great intelligence by their meanes. The greateſt part of both theſe Princes traines lay at Bayonne, and at the verie firſt meeting fell togither by the eares, notwitſtanding their league: and no maruell. For their maners and languages differed. Afterward the Earle of Lodeſme came alſo to viſite the King, and paſſed the riuer in a boate, the ſaile whereof was cloth of gold. Farther he ware a paire of buskins embrodred thicke with ſtone, for he was a Prince of great wealth and reuenews in Caſtille, and created ſince the Duke of Albourg. In the end theſe two confederate nations began to ſcoffe and ieſt each at other, the King of Caſtile was deformed, and the French miſliked his apparell, wherefore they derided him. Our King ware his apparell very ſhort, and maruelous vncomely, and was clad ſomtime in very courſe cloth, beſides that, he ware an old hat, differing from all the reſt of his company, and an image of lead vpon it, whereat the Caſtilians ieſted, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this proceeded of miſery. Thus ended this enterview with ſuch ſcoffes and taunts, that afterward theſe two Princes neuerloued togither. Farther great diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aroſe among the King of Caſtiles ſeruants, which continued till his death and long after, in ſuch ſort that I haue ſeene him the pooreſt Prince that euer raigned, and abandoned of all his ſeruants and ſubiects. The Queene of Arragon departed alſo diſcontented, for the King pronounced ſentence for the King of Caſtile. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both the King of Arragon hir husband and ſhe hated him euer after. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they vſed his helpe a while in their neceſſity againſt the towne of Barcelonne, yet endured not their friendſhip, but wars aroſe betweene them, which continued aboue ſixteene yeeres, and the controuerſie remaineth yet vndecided. Now to proceed to other examples.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of Burgundy ſince the time aboue mentioned, by his owne great ſute and ſollicitation, met with the Emperor <hi>Fredericke</hi> now raigning, at Treues <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP8.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>, where the Duke made great preparation to ſhew his pompe and magnificency. The Emperor and he treated there of many matters, and among the reſt, of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens mariage, which was afterward accompliſhed. But when they had been togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a certaine ſpace, the Emperor to the Dukes great reproch and diſhonor, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without leaue taking, wherefore they neuer loued after, neither themſelues nor their ſubiects. The Almains diſdained the Dukes pompe and lofty maner of ſpeech, ſaying that it proceeded of pride, the Burgundians on the contrary ſide deſpiſed the Emperors ſmall traine, and ſimple attire. To be ſhort, this iar grew ſo great that the wars of Nuz ſprang thereof.</p>
               <p>I was alſo at Saint Paul in Artois when the Duke of Burgundy and King <hi>Edward</hi> of England met there <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP8.NOTE4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref>. The Duke had maried his ſiſter, they were companions of one order, and abode there togither two daies. The Kings ſeruants were deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two factions, and both the parties complained to the Duke, who enclining more to the one than the other, encreaſed their hatred, and notwithſtanding that, he aided the King for the recouery of his realme, (out of the which he was chaſed by the Earle of Warwick) and furniſhed him both of men money, and ſhips: yet after this meeting, they neuer loued togither, neither could affoord each other a good word.</p>
               <p>I was likewiſe at Bruxels when the Palſzgraue of the Rheine came thither to the Duke of Burgundy, where he was honorably receaued, ſumptuouſly feaſted, and lodged in a chamber richly furniſhed. The Dukes men reported the Almains to be ſlouens, and void of ciuility, alledging that they threw their mirie bootes vpon their rich and ſtately beds, wherefore they made leſſe account of them, then before they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7649:42"/>
knew them. The Almains on the contrary ſide like enuious perſons miſliked this great pompe. To conclude, after this they neuer loued togither, neither ſought to pleaſure one another.</p>
               <p>I ſaw alſo the meeting of the Duke of Burgundy, and D. <hi>Sigiſmunde</hi> of Auſtrich <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP8.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref>, who ſolde vnto the ſaid Duke the County of Ferret, bordering vpon the County of Burgundy for a hundred thouſand gildons, not being able to defend it againſt the Switzers. Theſe two Princes liked not greatly one another. Afterward alſo Duke <hi>Sigiſmunde</hi> made peace with the Switzers, and tooke againe the ſaid County of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret without paying backe the money, whereof enſued infinite harmes to the Duke of Burgundy. At the ſelfe ſame time alſo came the Earle of Warwick to the Duke, who after their meeting were mortall enimies each to other.</p>
               <p>I was alſo preſent at the enteruiewe betweene the King our maſter, and King <hi>Edvvard</hi> of England at Picquigny <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP8.NOTE6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref>, neere to Amiens, whereof I will make mention heereafter more at large. All that they did there was but meere diſſimulation, for they performed no whit of that they promiſed. And notwithſtanding, that they were neuer after in war togither (bicauſe the ſea ſeuered them) yet perfect friendſhip was there none betweene them. Wherefore to conclude this diſcourſe, me thinke that two great Princes minding to continue in amity, ought neuer to meete togither. The occaſions of troubles that ariſe at ſuch aſſemblies are theſe, their ſeruants can not refraine from talking of matters paſt, and words will eaſely be taken in euill part. Secondarily, it is impoſſible but that the traine of the one ſhould be in better order then the other, where of ſcoffes ariſe, which they that are ſcoffed ſtomacke. Thirdly, if they be two nations, their language and apparell differ, and that that pleaſeth the one diſpleaſeth the other. Laſt of all, it commonly hapneth that the perſonage of the one Prince is comlier and better to be liked than the other, wherefore he is praiſed, and reioiceth and glorieth to heare his owne commendation, which cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſpraiſe of the other. And notwithſtanding that three or fower daies perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture after the aſſembly ended, theſe matters be communed of cloſely &amp; couertly in mens eares: yet by vſe they fall in time in open talke at dinners and ſuppers, and ſo are reported to both the parties, for fewe things in this world can be concealed, eſpecially tales and reports. Thus you haue heard the reaſons and examples that I my ſelfe haue ſeene touching this point.</p>

The firſt day all men were in great feare, and muttered vp and downe the towne: the ſecond the Duke was ſomewhat paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſate in counſell almoſt the whole day, and part alſo of the night. The King cauſed all thoſe to be laboured that he thought could aide him in this extremitie, making them large offers and promiſes, &amp; commanded alſo fifteen thouſand crowns to be diuided among the Dukes ſeruants, but he to whom the charge was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted acquit himſelfe not faithfully thereof: for part of the monie he retained to his owne vſe, as the King afterward vnderſtood. The King fearing eſpecially thoſe aboue named, that came with this armie of Burgundy, who in times paſt had beene his owne ſeruants, but were now his brothers the Duke of Normandies as they ſaid. In this councell aboue mentioned this matter was diuerſly debated, ſome were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the ſafe conduct giuen the King ſhould not be broken, ſeeing he offered to ſweare the treatie as it was articled in writing: others gaue counſell rudely to impriſon him without farther ceremonie, and others to ſend for his brother the Duke of Normandie, and to conclude a peace for the aduantage of all the Princes of Fraunce. They that gaue this aduiſe thought if their opinion tooke place, that the King ſhould be reſtrained of his libertie for euer, and held continually vnder garde, bicauſe a great Prince being in the hands of his enimie, and vſed after ſuch ſort, neuer or very hardly recouereth his libertie for feare of reuenge. This laſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion failed not much to take effect: for the matter was ſo far forward that I ſawe a man booted, and ready to depart with a packet of letters to the Duke of Normandie being then in Britaine, and ſtaied onely for the Duke of Burgundies letter, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this was daſhed againe. The King cauſed certaine ouertures to be made, offering to leaue there in hoſtage the Duke of Bourbon and the Cardinall his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Conſtable, with diuers others, vnder this condition, that the peace being concluded he might depart to Compiegne, promiſing incontinent either to cauſe the Liegeois to repaire the harmes done, or to declare himſelfe their enimie. They whom the King named for hoſtages outwardly made earneſt offer of themſelues, I know not whether they meant as they ſaid, and I doubt me they did not: for I verily beleeue if the King had left them there, they ſhould neuer haue returned into Fraunce.</p>
               <p>All this night being the third after the newes brought, the Duke neuer vnclothed him, but lay downe twiſe or thriſe vpon his bed, and then roſe and walked: for ſuch was his maner when he was troubled. I lay that night my ſelfe in his chamber, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7649:43"/>
communed with him diuers times. In the morning he was farther out of patience than euer before, vſing terrible menaces, and being ready to execute ſome great matter: notwithſtanding in the end he was pacified, and reſolued to hold himſelfe contented, if the King would ſweare the treatie, and go with him to Liege to helpe to reuenge the iniuries the Liegeois had done him, and the Biſhop of Liege his coſen, with the which meſſage ſuddenly he departed into the Kings chamber, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the King had a priuie watch word by a friend <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP9.NOTE1">

                  </ref>, who aduertiſed him that nothing was to be feared if he agreed to theſe two points, otherwiſe that he ſhould put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in ſo great danger, that none could be greater. When the Duke came to the Kings preſence, his voice trembled, and euen there he was like to fall into a newe rage, ſo much was he troubled. His behauior towards the King was humble and lowly, but his countenance furious, and his language ſharpe, for he asked him in few words wherher he would obſerue the treatie concluded, and alſo ſweare it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the King anſwered that he would. For you ſhall vnderſtand that the ſaid treaty as touching the Duke of Burgundy himſelfe was altred in no point otherwiſe than it was concluded before Paris, and as touching the Duke of Normandies partage, it was much amended for the King. For it was agreed that in ſtead of Normandy he ſhould haue Champaine and Brie, and certaine other places there about, for his partage. Then the Duke asked him againe, whether he would go with him to Liege to helpe him to reuenge the treaſon the Liegeois had wrought by his meanes, and by his comming thither, putting him alſo in minde of the neere kinred that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſaid King and the Biſhop of Liege, being of the houſe of Bourbon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the King anſwered, that after he had ſworne the treaty (which was the thing he moſt deſired) he would accompany him to Liege, and lead thither with him, as ſmall or as great force as the Duke ſhould thinke good: at which words the D. much reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and incontinent the treaty of peace was brought, and the ſelfe ſame croſſe that <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> vſuallie ware called the croſſe of victory: taken out of the Kings cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and there the two Princes ſware the treaty: <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP9.NOTE2">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next day after the treaty ſworne, the King and the Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Peronne, and went to Cambray, and from thence into the countrey of Liege in the very beginning of winter, and in a maruelous foule ſeaſon. The King had with him few ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or none, others than the Scottiſh men of his garde, but gaue commandement that three hundred men of armes ſhould folow after him. The Dukes army was deuided into two bands, the one led by the Marſhall of Burgundy (ſo often already mentioned) in the which were all the Burgundians, and the noble men of Sauoye aboue named, beſides great forces of the countries of Haynault, Luxembourg, Namure, and Lamburge, the other band the Duke him ſelfe lead: when they drew neere the citie of Liege they debated in the Dukes preſence what was to be done. Some gaue aduiſe to diſmiſſe part of the army, conſidering that the gates and wals of the citie were raſed the yeer before, and the citizens in vtter deſpaire of ſuccour: the King him ſelfe being there in perſon againſt them, and offering in maner the ſelfe ſame conditions of peace on their behalfe that were demanded. The Duke alowed not of this opinion, which was a happie turne for him, for if he had, he had marred all, but his ſuſpition of the King cauſed him to take the wiſeſt courſe: &amp; ſure his Captaines opinion in thinking themſelues too ſtrong, proceeded either of great pride or of great follie. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I haue often heard diuers Captaines giue the like aduiſe, ſome bicauſe they thinke thereby to win an opinion of hardneſſe, and ſome for that they vnderſtand not the matters debated, but wiſe Princes weigh not ſuch fond opinions. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this point, the King our Maſter had learned his leſſon, for as he was ſlow and fearfull in attempting any thing: ſo when he tooke once an enterpriſe in hand, he ſo throughlie furniſhed him ſelfe of euery thing thereunto appertaining, that he could not but obtaine his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Order was then giuen that the Marſhall of Burgundie with his band ſhould go before and lodge in the citie, and if the citizens made difficulty to receiue him, as it was thought they would not, bicauſe diuers of them were already come to the Duke to treate of peace, that then he ſhould attempt to enter by force. The ſaide Marſhall and his company went to Namur, and the next day departed thence, and the King and the D. arriued there. But when the Marſhall approched neer the city, this fooliſh people ſalied foorth to the skirmiſh and were eaſilie repulſed, and a great number ſlaine, the reſt retired into the towne, and at that verie inſtant eſcaped their Biſhop and came to vs. Within the towne was a legate ſent thither by the Pope to vnderſtand of the variance betweene the Biſhop and the people, and to pacifie the matter. For the ſentence of excommunication pronounced againſt them was yet vnreuoked, bicauſe of their offences aboue reherſed. This legate paſſing the bands of his commiſſion, fauored altogither the people in hope to obtaine the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick for him ſelfe, and commanded them to take armes for their defence, and encouraged them to diuers other folies. Notwithſtanding now ſeeing the city in this danger, he iſſued foorth with intent to flie, but was taken and all his traine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7649:44"/>
being to the number of fiue and twentie very well mounted. The Duke hearing theſe newes ſeemed notwithſtanding to take no notice thereof, but ſent word to thoſe that tooke him that they ſhould leade him into ſome ſecret place, and make their profit of him as of ſome merchant, and in no wiſe to aduertiſe him of this accident, alleaging that if he came openly into his campe, he could not ſuffer them to keepe him, but muſt of force deliuer him, for honor of the ſea apoſtolike. Notwithſtanding they could not do as they were commanded, but fell at variance for him in ſuch ſort, that openly at diner time certaine that claimed part in the bootie, came and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Duke: wherefore he ſent immediately and tooke him from them, and reſtored him all that he loſt, and entertained him very honorably.</p>
               <p>This vaward led by the Marſhall of Burgundie and the Lord of Hymbercourt, marched ſtraight to the citie, ſuppoſing to enter without reſiſtance, and through couetouſnes (hoping to haue the ſpoile thereof to themſelues) refuſed the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that was offered, neither thought it needfull to tarrie for the King and the Duke, being ſeuen or eight leagues behinde them, but marched with ſuch ſpeede that they arriued at the towne by twilight, and entred into a certaine ſuburbs lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtraight to a gate that the citizens had ſomewhat repaired. There the Liegeois and they parled togither but could not agree. In the meane time they were benigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, their lodgings were vnmade, neither was the place large ynough for the ſeate of their camp, beſide that they were in great diſorder, ſome walked vp and downe, ſome called their maſters, their companions, and their captains: which folly and diſorder Maſter <hi>Iohn de Villette</hi> and other captains of the Liegeois perceiuing, tooke hart and determined to iſſue foorth, and their misfortune I meane the ruine of their wals, ſerued them to good purpoſe in this enterpriſe: for they ſalied foorth where liked them beſt by the breaches thereof, and came in order of battell to the foremoſt ranks of the Burgundians. Farther, among the vines and little hils they aſſailed the pages and ſtraglers that walked their Maſters horſes without the ſuburbs by the which our men entred. A great number of good ſoldiers were there ſlaine, but a greater number fled, for the night couereth all ſhame. To be ſhort, the Liegeois ſo couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly executed their enterpriſe, that they ſlue at the leaſt eight hundred: one hundred of them being men of armes. But the hardie and valiant ſoldiers of this vaward being in maner all men of armes and gentlemen of good houſes, ioined themſelues togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and marched with enſigne diſplaied ſtraight to the gate, fearing the citizens ſalie there. The waies were maruellous deepe, bicauſe of continuall raine, in ſuch ſort that the men of armes being all on foote ſtood in mire aboue the ankles. Once all the citizens thought to ſalie foorth at the ſaid gate with great torches and lights, but our men had mounted fower good peeces of artillerie in the very mouth thereof, the which ſhot twiſe or thriſe along the high ſtreete, and ſlew a great number, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they all retired out of the ſuburbes, and ſhut their gates. But during this skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in the ſuburbes, the others that had ſalied forth to aſſaile the pages aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, tooke certaine carts neer to the towne, in the which they lodged themſelues very vncommodiouſly, and taried without the citie from two of the clocke after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, till ſix in the morning, but ſo ſoone as the day brake that one might deſcry another, they were repulſed, and in their retract maſter <hi>Iohn de Villette,</hi> and one or two more of their captaines hurt, who died all within two daies after.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Otwithſtanding that ſalies out of a towne be ſomtimes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, yet are they very dangerous for thoſe that defend the place, for the loſſe of ten men is more to them, than of an hundred to thoſe that beſiege them, firſt bicauſe their number is not equall, ſecondarily bicauſe they cannot put men into the towne at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and laſtly bicauſe haply they may looſe one of their cheefe captaines, which miſhap cauſeth oftentimes the loſſe alſo of the place. Theſe diſcomfortable newes were foorthwith brought to the Duke, lying fower or fiue leagues from the towne, and the firſt report was, that his whole vaward was diſcomfited, yet that notwithſtanding he and the whole army mounted on horſebacke, commanding that no word ſhould be made to the King of this misfortune. And when he drew neere the citie on the contrary ſide to that where his vaward lay, he was aduertiſed that all was well, and the loſſe nothing ſo great as was thought, neither any man of name ſlaine but a knight of Flaunders na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Monſeur de Sergine, notwithſtanding they ſent him word that the valiant gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and ſoldiers of his vaward were vtterly wearied, and in great trouble and diſtreſſe, for all that night they had ſtoode vpright in the mire by the towne gate. Farther they told him that certaine of the footemen that fled were returned ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, that they ſeemed vnfit for any great exploit. Wherefore they deſired him for Gods loue to make haſte, to the end the citizens might be forced to retire euery man to the defence of his owne quarter, and that it would pleaſe him to ſende them ſome vittails, for they had not one morſell of meat. The D. foorthwith commanded two or three hundred to ride thither as faſt as their horſes could gallop, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort his ſoldiers, and ſent after them al the vittails he could come by, and ſo was it high time, for by the ſpace of two daies almoſt and a night, they had neither eaten nor drunke, vnleſſe it were ſome one that caried a draught of wine in a bottell. Beſides that, the weather was maruelous foule, neither could they poſſibly enter the town on that ſide they lay, vnleſſe the Duke embuſied the enimie on the other ſide. A great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them were hurt, and among the reſt the Prince of Orenge (whom I had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to name before) who behaued himſelfe that day like a couragious gentleman, for he neuer mooued foote off the place he firſt poſſeſſed. The Lords of Lau and Vrfé did alſo very valiantly, but the number of the footmen that fled the night of the skirmiſh was at the leaſt ten thouſand. It was almoſt darke night when the Duke receaued this newes, but after he had diſpatched all his buſines he returned to his enſigne and rehearſed the whole order of the skirmiſh to the King, who reioiced to heare that all was ſo wel, for the contrary might haue turned to his preiudice. When they approched neere the towne, a great number of gentlemen and men of armes lighted on foote with the archers to take the ſuburbes which were eaſely won, and there the baſtard of Burgundy (who had great charge in this army vnder the Duke,) the Lord of Rauaſtaine, the earle of Roucy, the Conſtables ſonne and diuers other gentlemen lodged, euen hard by the gate, which the enimies had alſo repaired as the former. The Duke lodged in the midſt of the ſuburbes, but the King lay that night in a great grange, a quarter of a league from the town, where was very good lodging,

                  </ref>, the riuer of Maz runneth through it: it is about the greatnes of Roan, and was at that time a maruellous populous citie. From the gate where we lodged to the other where our vaward lay, the way was ſhort through the towne, but without, it was at the leaſt three leagues going, ſo crooked and foule are the waies eſpecially in winter, in the midſt whereof we came thither. Their wals were all raſed, ſo that they might ſaly foorth where beſt liked them, and their defence was onely a little rampire of earth: for the towne was neuer ditched, bicauſe the foundation is hard and ſharpe rock. The firſt night of the Dukes arriuall, our vaward was much refreſhed and eaſed: for the force within the towne was then diuided into two parts. About mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night they gaue vs a hot alarme, whereupon the Duke iſſued foorthwith into the ſtreet, and ſoone after arriued alſo the King and the Conſtable with great ſpeede, conſidering how far off they lay. Some cried they ſaly out at ſuch a gate, others ſpake diuers diſcomfortable words, the darke and rainie weather increaſed alſo their feare. The Duke lacked no courage, but failed ſomtime in good order giuing: and to ſay the truth, at this time he behaued not himſelfe ſo aduiſedly as many wiſhed, bicauſe of the Kings preſence. Wherefore the King tooke vpon him authoritie to command, and ſaid to the Conſtable, Leade your men into ſuch a quarter, for if they ſalie that is their way: and ſure both his words and behauiour ſhewed him to be a Prince of great vertue and wiſedome, and well acquainted with ſuch exploits: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this great alarme prooued nothing, whereupon the King and the Duke retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their lodging.</p>
               <p>The next morning came the King and lodged alſo in the ſuburbs in a little houſe hard by the Dukes lodging, accompanied with an hundred Scottiſh men of his garde, and his men of armes lying in a little village hard by him, which bred great ſuſpicion in the Duke that he would either enter the citie, or eſcape before it were taken <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP11.NOTE2">

Wherefore he put into a great grange iuſt betweene their two lodgings three hundred men of armes, being all the flower of his houſe, who brake downe the panes of the wals to ſaly foorth the more ſpeedily if neede ſo required, and theſe had their eies continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vpon the Kings lodging which was hard by them. The ſiege continued eight daies, during which ſpace neither the Duke nor any of the company vnarmed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.

Farther, the hower appointed for the enterpriſe was eight of the clocke in the morning: the ſame night the aſſault was thus concluded, the Duke vnarmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which ſince the beginning of the ſiege he had not done, and commanded the whole armie, eſpecially thoſe that lodged in the grange betweene his lodging and the Kings to do the like, to the end they might refreſh themſelues: but the ſelfeſame night the citizens as though they had beene aduertiſed of this determination, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to make a ſalie out of the towne on this ſide, as they had before on the other.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will now rehearſe an example whereby you ſhall perceiue how eaſely euen a few enimies may worke a great Prince diſpleaſure, and how much it importeth Princes throughly to waie their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes before they attempt them. Within this citie there was not one man of war but of their owne territory, they had with them neither knight nor eſquire: for thoſe fewe they had were either ſlaine or hurt two or three daies before in the ſaly aboue mentioned. They were vnfurniſhed of gates, wals, trenches &amp; artillery ought worth. To be ſhort, within the towne were none but the citizens themſelues, and ſeauen or eight hundred footemen of a litle territory beyond Liege, called Franche-mount: true it is that the people of thoſe parts haue euer beene accounted good ſoldiers. But now to the matter. Theſe Liegeois deſpairing of ſuccours, ſeeing the K. there in perſon againſt them, concluded to make a deſperate ſaly, and to put all things in aduenture, knowing themſelues to be but loſt men.</p>
               <p>Their enterpriſe was this, they determined that by the breaches of their wals hanging ouer the backſide of the Dukes lodging, their beſt ſoldiers being ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men of the countrey of Franchemont ſhould ſalie foorth, leading with them for guides the hoſts of the Kings lodging and of the D. Farther there laie a priuie way through the rocks, by the which they might come vnder couert almoſt to the lodgings of both theſe Princes before they were diſcouered, prouided that they made no noiſe: and as touching our ſcoutes that laie in their way, they made account either to kill them, or to be at the Princes lodging aſſoone as they. Thus they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to follow theſe two hoſts into their houſes, where the two Princes lodged, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtaying by the way in any place, hoping to ſteale vpon them on ſuch a ſudden, that either they would kill them, or leade them away priſoners before their forces could come to reſcue them, conſidering withall how ſhort their retrait was into the towne, and if the woorſt fell (that was to die:) they were fully reſolued in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſuch an enterpriſe to take their death in good part: for they ſaw themſelues but loſt men on all ſides. They gaue order alſo that all the people of the towne with hue and cry, ſhould iſſue foorth at the gate opening vpon the ſuburbs where we lay, truſting thereby to diſcomfite all our company that lodged there. Neither were they out of hope of a goodly victory, at the leaſt they were ſure of a glorious end. This their enterpriſe notwithſtanding it had been deſperate and dangerous, though they had been accompanied with a thouſand valiant men of armes: yet theſe fewe failed not much to atchieue it. For according to their determination, theſe ſix hundred men of Franche-mont ſalied foorth by the breaches of their wals, about ten of the clock at night, and came on a ſudden vpon our ſcouts and ſlew them, three of them being gentlemen of the Dukes houſe, and if they had gone ſtraight foorth without any noiſe to the place appointed, vndoubtedly they had ſlaine both theſe Princes in

their beds. But you ſhall vnderſtand that behind the Duke of Burgundies lodging, there was a pauilion where the Duke of Alenſon that now is, and Monſeur <hi>de Cran</hi> lodged. There theſe Liegeois ſtaied a while and thruſt their pikes through it, and ſlew a ſeruing man within it: whereupon a noiſe aroſe in the campe which cauſed ſome to arme themſelues, at the leaſt to ariſe. From this pauillion they departed towards the two Princes lodgings, whereunto adioined the graunge aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, into the which the Duke had put three hundred men of armes. There they ſtaied a while alſo, and thruſt their pickes in at the panes of the wals which theſe men of armes had broken downe to ſalie foorth with the more ſpeed. All the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that lay there had vnarmed themſelues not paſt two houres before to refreſh them againſt the aſſault the next morning: in the which eſtate the Liegeois found them. Notwithſtanding a few of them hauing put on their quiracies bicauſe of the noiſe they heard at the Duke of Alenſons pauilion, fought with their enimies at the broken panes of the wals, and at the doore, which was the onely preſeruation of theſe two great Princes liues: for this delay gaue a great many leiſure to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and to come foorth into the ſtreet. I lay that night in the Dukes chamber (which was very ſtraight) with two other gentlemen of his priuie chamber, and aboue him lodged twelue archers that kept the watch and ſat vp at dice, but the body of his watch ſtoode by the towne gate farre from his lodging. To be ſhort the Dukes hoſt came with a band of Ligeois, and aſſailed his owne houſe the D. being within it, vpon ſuch a ſudden that we hardly had leiſure to buckle his quirace about him and put a ſallet on his hed: for immediately as we went downe the ſtayres to iſſue foorth into the ſtreet, we found our archers buſied in defending the doore and windows againſt the Liegeois: farther there was a maruellous noiſe in the ſtreets, ſome cried God ſaue the King, others God ſaue the Duke, and others God ſaue the King, kill, kill, kill. It was two Pater noſters while before our archers and we could get foorth of the houſe, we knew not in what eſtate the King was, nor whether he were with vs or againſt vs, which much troubled vs. Incontinent after we were iſſued foorth with two or three torches, we met others in the ſtreets with lights alſo, and ſaw fighting and killing round about vs, but the conflict ſoone ended: for men came running on all ſides to the Dukes lodging. The firſt man of the enimies that was ſlaine was the Dukes hoſt, but he died not preſently, for I my ſelfe heard him ſpeake. To be ſhort all the Liegeois that accompanied him, a very few excepted were alſo ſlaine. They aſſailed in like maner the K. lodging, into the which his hoſt entred and was ſlaine by the Scottiſh men of his gard, who ſhewed themſelues talle felows: for they neuer ſtirred from their Maſters foote, but ſhot arrowes continually which hurt moe Burgundians then Liegeois. The citizens appointed to iſſue foorth at the town gate ſalied accordingly, but our watch being aſſembled togither repulſed them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent, neither ſhewed they themſelues ſo deſperate as theſe others. Immediately after theſe were beaten backe, the King and the Duke met, doubting bicauſe of the number they ſaw ſlaine, their owne loſſe to be great: notwithſtanding of their men few were ſlaine, but many hurt. Vndoubtedly if theſe Liegeois had not ſtaied at theſe two places aboue mentioned, eſpecially at the grange where they found reſiſtance, but had followed theſe two hoſts being their guides, they had ſlaine both the King and the Duke, and thereby peraduenture diſcomfited the whole army. Both the Princes returned to their lodgings woonderfully abaſhed at this deſperate enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and foorth ſat in counſell to take aduiſe what ſhould be done touching the aſſault the next morning. The King ſeemed to ſtand in great doubt of the matter in reſpect of himſelfe in very deed, for knowing how greatly the Duke doubted wars
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7649:46"/>
with Fraunce if he were once out of his hands: he feared if the citie could not be taken by aſſault, that his returne into his realme ſhould be delaied, and peraduenture himſelfe put in priſon for the Dukes better aſſurance. Whereby you may perceiue in how miſerable eſtate theſe two princes liued, which could by no meanes aſſure themſelues each of other: for they had concluded and ſolemnly ſworne a finall peace not paſt fifteen daies before, yet could al this put neither of them in aſſurance.</p>

They told him that the reſolution was to aſſault the citie the next morning, according to the order firſt appointed. Then he very wiſely began to alleage diuers great doubts, which pleaſed well the Dukes men, for they all feared the aſſault maruellouſly both bicauſe of the great number of people within the towne, and alſo bicauſe of the deſperate ſalie made not paſt two howers before: wherefore being deſirous to ſtay the aſſault for two or three daies, and take the towne by compoſition, they went foorthwith to the Duke to make report of the Kings allegations, I my ſelfe being preſent when they came. There they rehearſed all the doubts the King alleaged, and as many as they themſelues could deuiſe, but al they fathered vpon the King, doubting that he would not take it well at their hands. The D. anſwered, that the King alleaged theſe doubts only to ſaue the citizens, &amp; tooke it in euill part, ſaying that there could be no danger in the enterpriſe, conſidering that they within could make no counterbatterie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had any wals for their defence, adding alſo that the rampires they had made at the gates were already beaten down, wherfore he would vſe no further delaies, but go to the aſſault the next morning, as it was concluded. Notwithſtanding he would be contented that the King, if it ſo pleaſed him, ſhould go to Namur till the taking of the towne vnder this condition, not to depart thence till the iſſue of this enterpriſe were ſeene: which anſwer pleaſed none of them all, for euery man feared the aſſault bicauſe of this ſalie. The Dukes anſwere was reported to the King, not in ſo hard termes as he deliuered it, but in much milder language. The King vnderſtood the meaning of it well ynough, and ſaid he would not go to Namur, but be at the aſſault the next day among the reſt. In mine opinion if he had been ſo diſpoſed, he might very eaſily haue eſcaped that night, for he had with him an hundred archers of his garde, and certaine gentlemen of his houſe, beſides three hundred men of armes that lodged hard by him: but vndoubtedly where he ſtood vpon his honor he would not be ſtained with cowardize. Euery man repoſed himſelfe in his armor til morning, and ſome diſpoſed of their conſciences, bicauſe the enterpriſe ſeemed very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. When it was brode day light, and that the hower appointed drew neer, which was eight of the clock, the Duke commanded the bombard and the two ſerpentines to be diſcharged, thereby to aduertiſe our vaward of the aſſault, which lay on the other ſide far from vs, if you take the way without the towne, but not far going through it, as before you haue heard. They hearing the ſhot incontinent prepared
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7649:47"/>
themſelues to the aſſault. The Dukes trumpets ſounded, and his enſiegnes were anaunced towards the wals, their bands folowing them. The King ſtood in the midſt of the ſtreete very well accompanied, for all his three hundred men of armes, his garde, and certain noble men, and gentlemen of his houſe were with him. And when we approched ſo neere the wals that they and we ſhould haue ioined, no reſiſtance was founde, neither any man vpon the wals, ſaue two or three of the watch, all the reſt were gon to diner, ſuppoſing we would not giue the aſſault vpon the Sonday, ſo that we found the cloth laid in euery houſe at our entry. Small account is to be made of rude people vnleſſe they be led by ſome captaine whom they reuerence, although ſomtime in their fury they be greatly to be feared.</p>
               <p>Theſe Liegeois were before the aſſault maruelouſly ſpent and wearied, partly bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their two ſalies, wherein they loſt a great number of their men and all their leaders, and partly bicauſe of the great labor &amp; trauel they had ſuſtained the ſpace of eight daies: for bicauſe they lay open to the enimy on all ſides, they were all forced to be continually vpon the wals, and I ſuppoſe they thought to repoſe themſelues this day bicauſe of the Sabaoth, but it chaunced to them contrary to their expectation. On that ſide we entred was no reſiſtance made, and leſſe yet on the other where our vawarde lay, which entred the towne before vs. Fewe were ſlaine <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP13.NOTE1">

The King ſeeing no reſiſtance, and the whole army (being as I gheſſe to the number of forty thouſand) throng into the towne at two breaches, marched forward at leaſure, to whom the Duke being entred a good way into the city ſodainly returned, &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him to the palace, from whence he went to the cathedrall Church of Saint Lambert <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP13.NOTE2">

For mine owne part I entred into none but the cathedral church, but thus I was aduertiſed and ſawe alſo good proofe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for the Pope many yeeres after excommunicated all thoſe that withheld any of theſe church goods, vnleſſe they reſtored them, and the Duke appointed certaine commiſſioners to go through his countrey, to ſee the Popes commandement execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The city being thus taken and ſacked, about noone the Duke returned to the pallace. The King had already dined, and ſeemed greatly to reioice at the taking of the towne, and commended alſo much the Dukes courage and valiantnes, knowing that report thereof ſhould be made to him, and that theſe good words would ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further his returne into his realme, which was his ſpeciall deſire.

In like maner alſo diuers were appointed for defence of the other Churches. This done the Duke departed into the countrey of Frachemont, and immediately after he was out of the towne we ſaw a great number of houſes on this ſide the riuer on fire: he marched forwarde and lodged fower leagues off, yet heard we the noiſe as eaſilie as if we had beene there preſent: I wot not whether it were bicauſe the winde ſat that

Farther our men hunted the poore people out of great woods and foreſts where they lay hidden with their goods, and manie they ſlew and tooke priſoners, and there the ſoldiers got good booties. The cold was more extreme then is almoſt credible: for I ſaw a gentleman that with cold loſt the vſe of his foote and neuer recouered it, and a Page that had two of his fingers rotted from his hand, and in like maner a woman dead for cold and her childe with her, whereof ſhee was newely deliuered. Farther by the ſpace of three daies all the wine that was drunke in the Dukes lodging was cut with hatchets: for it was ſo frozen in the veſſels that we were forced to breake them, and cut the wine being a maſſe of yſe into ſmall peeces, which men bare away in hats and baskets as beſt liked them.

The King ſent in like maner to him about that matter, and manie meſſengers ran to and fro betweene them. The Duke of Burgundie ſent alſo his ambaſſadors to the ſaide Lord <hi>Charles,</hi> deſiring him to accept no other partage then Champaigne and Brie, which by his meanes was granted him, ſhewing him withall how great good will he bare him, ſith notwithſtanding he had abandoned him, yet would not he do the like as the ſequell well declared, but had alſo comprehended the Duke of Britain in the treatie as his confederate. Farther he ſent him word that Champaigne and Brie lay very commodiouſly for them both, bicauſe if the King ſhould at any time attempt ought againſt him, he might within two daies warning haue ſuccours out of Burgundie: the two countries bordering on vpon another. Laſtely he aduertiſed him that his partage was very good, and that he might leuie in his countries, aides, cuſtomes, and ſubſidies, neither could the King claime any thing there but homage, reſort, and ſoueraignity. This Lord Charles was a man doing little or nothing of himſelfe, but wholy lead and gouerned by others: notwithſtanding that he were aboue fiue and twenty yeeres of age. Thus paſſed the winter which was well ſpent before the Kings departure from vs, meſſengers ran continually to and fro about this partage: for the King ment nothing leſſe then to giue his brother that he had promiſed, bicauſe he would not haue him and the Duke of Burgundie ſo neere neighbours. But he treated with his brother to take Guienne, (which is in maner all Aquitaine:) for Brie and Champaigne. The Lord <hi>Charles</hi> feared to diſpleaſe the Duke of Bourgundy, and doubted if he yeelded to the Kings requeſt, and he ſhould not keepe touch with him, that then he ſhould looſe both freend and partage, and ſo be left bare boord. But the King being the ſubtileſt prince then liuing, and the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningeſt dealer in ſuch treaties, perceiuing that he ſhould do no good vnleſſe he wan thoſe that were in credit with his brother, fell in communication of this matter with <hi>Oudet</hi> of Rie, Lord of Leſcut afterwards Earle of Comminges (who was borne and maried in the countrey of Guienne) deſiring him to perſwade his maſter to accept this partage being much better than that he demanded, &amp; that they mought

be friends and liue togither like brethren, adding alſo that this partage ſhould be much more beneficiall both for his brother and his ſeruants, (eſpecially for the ſaide <hi>Oudet)</hi> than the other, and farther aſſuring him that without faile he would deliuer his brother quiet poſſeſſion of the ſaid countrey. By this means was the Lord <hi>Charles</hi> won to accept this partage of Guienne to the Duke of Burgundies great diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and his ambaſſadors there preſent. And the cauſe why cardinall Balue biſhop of Angiers <ref target="#S5602.BK2.CHAP15.NOTE1">

Thus the Lord <hi>Charles</hi> was made Duke of Guienne, the yeere 1469. and the poſſeſſion of the countrey togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the gouernment of Rochell deliuered him, and than the King and he ſawe one another, and were togither a long time.</p>

And to the ende you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue what cunnig is vſed in Fraunce, I will ſhew you how this matter was managed, for the King and the Duke were both abuſed, whereof aroſe whot and ſharpe war, which endured thirteen or foureteen yeeres. The King deſired greatly to mooue theſe townes aboue named to rebellion, pretending (to the end he might haue the better means to practiſe with them) that the Duke aduanced his limits farther then the treatie would beare: whereupon ambaſſadors ran to and fro, who vnder colour of their ambaſſage practiſed continually as they paſſed through theſe townes, to the end aboue mentioned. In the ſaid townes were no garriſons but all was quiet both in the realme, in Burgundie, and in Britaine. And the Duke of Guien liued to all mens iudgments in great amitie with the King his brother. Notwithſtanding when the King firſt mooued this war, his meaning was not to take one or two of theſe towns onely, but ſought to ſtir all the Duke of Burgundies ſubiects to rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, truſting to atchieue his enterpriſe by this means. Diuers to obtaine his fauor entertained theſe practiſes, and reported their intelligence to be far greater then it was: for one promiſed to take this towne, an other that, and yet indeed all was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Wherefore notwithſtanding that the King had iuſt cauſe to be diſpleaſed for his euill vſage at Peronne, yet if he had thought this enterpriſe would haue fallen none otherwiſe out then it did, he would not haue broken the treatie nor mooued war: for he had made the peace to be proclaimed at Paris three months after his returne into his realme, and began this war with ſome feare, but the great hope he had conceiued of it, pricked him forward: and marke I pray you what cunning was vſed to further it. The Earle of Saint Paule Conſtable of Fraunce, (a very wiſe man,) and certaine of the Duke of Guien his ſeruants, with diuers others deſired rather war then peace betweene theſe two great Princes, for two reſpects: The one they feared leaſt their great offices and penſions ſhould be diminiſhed, if peace conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. For you ſhal vnderſtand that the Conſtable had vnder his charge 4. hundred men of armes or launces paied by his owne hands euery muſter, without controu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: farther beſides the fee and profits of his office, he had a yeerely penſion of thirty thouſand frankes and better, and receiued alſo the reuenews of many goodly places that he kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:7649:50"/>
The other reſpect was this, they ſought to perſwade the King, and talked alſo to the like purpoſe among themſelues, that his diſpoſition was ſuch, that his head could neuer be idle, wherefore vnleſſe he were buſied with great Princes abroad he would be in hand with his ſeruants and officers at home. For theſe two reaſons therefore they ſought to intangle him with wars: whereunto the better to perſwade him the Conſtable promiſed to take Saint Quintine at all times when him liſted, bicauſe his lands lay round about it, vaunting further that he had great intelligence in Flanders and Brabant, ſo far foorth that he would make a number of townes to reuolt from the Duke. The Duke of Guienne alſo being there preſent and all their principall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, offered very earneſtly and promiſed very faithfully to ſerue the King in this quarrell, and to leade with them fower or fiue hundred men of armes that the ſaid Duke held in ordinary pay: but their drift was other than the King ſuppoſed, as heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after you ſhall heare. The King bicauſe he would ſeeme to proceede with due aduiſe and deepe conſideration, called a Parlament of the three eſtates of his realme at Tours, in the moneths of March and Aprill in the yeere 1470. which was the firſt and laſt Parlament that euer he aſſembled. But to this Parlament came onely ſuch as were purpoſely named, and ſuch as the King knew would not gainſay him in any point. There he cauſed diuers enterpriſes to be diſcouered, that the Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie had attempted againſt the crowne, and made the Earle of Eu openly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of him, ſaying, that the Duke detained from him contrarie to all lawe and equity Saint Valery and certaine otherlands, that he the ſaid Earle held of the Duke as parcels of the Seignorie of Abbeuille, and the county of Ponthieu, the onely cauſe whereof was, for that a little ſhip of war of Eu had taken a Flemmiſh hoy laden with marchandiſe, the loſſe whereof the Earle offered to repay: further adding, that the Duke would conſtraine him to do him homage, and giue him his faith againſt all men none excepted, which he would neuer do, bicauſe it ſhould be preiudiciall to the Kings eſtate. At this aſſemblie were diuers lawyers as well of the Parlament of Paris as other places, who concluded according to the Kings pleaſure, that the Duke ſhould be ſummoned to appeere in the Parlament at Paris. The King knew well that he would anſwere diſdainfully, or do ſomwhat preiudiciall to the authoritie of the court, wherby he ſhould haue the iuſter pretence of war againſt him. Thus the Duke being in Gaunt was ſommoned as he went to maſſe by a purſeuant of the Parlament to appeere at Paris: wherewith he was much abaſhed and diſcontented, and cauſed the purſeuant foorthwith to be apprehended and committed to warde, where he remained certaine daies, but in the end was diſmiſſed and ſent home. Thus you ſee what preparation was made to inuade the Duke of Burgundie, who being aduertiſed thereof, leuied a great band of men paid with home wages (as they termed them) which was a trifle they receiued to be in a readines in their owne houſes. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they muſtered monethly in the townes where they dwelt, and receiued their pay. But at three or fower moneths end the Duke waxed wearie of the charge and diſmiſſed theſe men, baniſhing all feare bicauſe the King ſent often to him, and ſo departed into Holland. He entertained no ſoldiers in ordinarie pay for the ſafetie of his countrie, neither held any garriſons in the frontire townes, whereof enſued great inconuenience: for there was daily practiſing in Amiens, Abbeuile, and Saint Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine to yeeld them againe to the King. The Duke being in Holland was aduertiſed by <hi>Iohn</hi> late Duke of Bourbon, that ſhortly war ſhould be made vpon him as well in Burgundie as in Picardie, and that the King had great intelligence not onely in his dominions but alſo in his houſe: with the which meſſage he was maruelouſly abaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for he was vtterly vnfurniſhed of men of war, bicauſe he had diſcharged the band

For he beleeued not all that was told him.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo daies after his ſeruants departure, which was in the moneth of December the yeere 1470. the Conſtable entred into Saint Quintine and ſware them to the King. Then the Duke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his affaires to be in bad eſtate, for he had no force with him, but had ſent all his ſeruants abroad to muſter men in his dominions: Notwithſtanding with thoſe fewe he could leuie being foure or fiue hundred horſe he went to Dourlans, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to keepe Amiens from reuolting. There he abode fiue or ſixe daies: all the which ſpace they in Amiens continually practiſed. The Kings army lying not farre off, ſhewed it ſelfe before the towne and was once refuſed: for part of the citizens held for the Duke: wherefore the Duke ſent thither to make his lodging, and if he had beene ſo ſtrong that the might haue aduentured to enter in perſon, the towne had neuer beene loſt, but he was afraid to go thither weakely accompanied: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that diuers of the towne required him ſo to do. But when they of the contrary faction ſawe his feare that he durſt not enter the towne, they executed their enterpriſe, and reioiced the Kings forces. They of Abbeuille thought to do the like, but the Lord of Cordes entred in thither for the Duke, and preuented their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Dourlans is diſtant from Amiens but fiue ſmall leagues, wherefore the Duke was forced to depart thence, ſo ſoone as he vnderſtood of Amiens reuolt: from thence therfore he went to Arras in great haſte and feare, doubting the execution
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7649:51"/>
of diuers other ſuch enterpriſes, for that he ſaw himſelfe enuironed with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables kinsfolkes &amp; freinds: farther bicauſe the baſtard <hi>Baudouin</hi> was fled, he entred into ſuſpicion of his other brother the great baſtard of Burgundie: notwithſtanding his forces repaired to him by litle and litle. The King thought now that all had been his owne, ſuppoſing the aduertiſements to be true that the Conſtable and the reſt had giuen him of their intelligences, whereupon if he had not hoped, he would haue wiſhed this enterpriſe vnbegun.</p>
               <p>It is meete I ſhould heare declare what mooued the Conſtable and the Duke of Guienne conſidering the great fauor, courteſies, and benefits the Duke of Guienne had receaued at the Duke of Burgundies hands, to kindle the fire betweene theſe two Princes that lay at reſt in their dominions, and which way this war could turne to their profit. Somwhat I ſpake heerof before, ſaying, that they did it to be in the more aſſurance of their eſtates and offices. For they feared if the King liued in peace he would keepe ſome ſtir among them. Notwithſtanding this was not the onely cauſe that mooued them. But you ſhall vnderſtand that the Duke of Guienne and they had been earneſt ſuters to conclude a mariage betweene the ſaid Duke of Guienne, and the Duke of Burgundies onely daughter and heire (for ſonne he had none) which matter they had often mooued to the Duke, who in words ſhewed himſelfe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing thereunto, yet notwithſtanding would neuer conclude it, but entertained others alſo in hope thereof. Now marke how theſe men ſought to atchieue their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe by conſtraining the Duke of Burgundy to this marriage. Immediately after theſe two towns were taken, and the Duke gon to Arras to leuy forces with al ſpeed: the Duke of Guienne ſent a ſecret meſſenger to him, who brought him three lines written with the ſaid Dukes owne hand, foulded vp in a ſmall lumpe of waxe, and conteining theſe words. <hi>Endeuor your ſelfe to appeaſe your ſubiects, and you ſhall not faile of friends.</hi> Farther the Duke of Burgundy being at the firſt in exceeding great feare, ſent to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtable, deſiring him to ſhew himſelf fauorable, &amp; not to preſſe forward this war begun without any defiance made. At the which meſſage the Conſtable greatly reioiced, ſuppoſing that he now held the Duke in ſuch feare as he deſired, which to increaſe, he ſent him a ſpeedy &amp; diſcomfortable anſwere, the effect wherof was, that his ſtate ſtoode in maruellous danger, ſo far foorth that he ſaw no way for him to winde himſelfe out of theſe troubles but one. Namely by giuing his daughter in mariage to the D. of Guienne, which if he would do, he ſhould than be ſuccoured with great forces: for both the Duke of Guienne and diuers others Lords would declare themſelues for him againſt the King, and he alſo would reſtore him Saint Quintine and take his part, otherwiſe he ſaid he durſt do nothing, conſidering how ſtrong the K. was, hauing both his army very wel appointed, &amp; alſo great intelligence in the Dukes dominions. This was the anſwer he ſent, with diuers other fearefull meſſages. But I neuer knew man in my life come to good end that ſought to put in feare and hold in ſubiection his maſter, or any other great Prince with whom he had to do, as in the end the Conſtables example ſhall well declare. For notwithſtanding that the King were then his maſter, and that the greateſt part of his reuenues lay, and all his children were reſident in the Duke of Burgundies dominions: yet continued he theſe practiſes againſt both theſe Princes, with intent to hold them both in feare each by other, which coſt him deere in the end, and no maruel. For notwithſtanding that euery man deſire to liue out of ſubiection and feare, and that all men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hate theſe that hold them in awe: yet none ſo extremely as Princes. For I neuer knew Prince that hated not mortally all thoſe that ſought to put him feare.</p>
               <p>After the D. of Burgundy had receaued the Conſtables anſwer, he perceaued wel
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7649:52"/>
no friendſhip to be in him, &amp; farther that he was the only author of this war. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he conceaued ſo extreme hatred againſt him, that after this he could neuer brooke him, eſpecially bicauſe by theſe fearfull meſſages he fought to conſtraine him to mary his daughter at his pleaſure: a vaine attempt. For before the returne of the Conſtables anſwer, the Duke had recouered his ſpirits, and had a great army with him. You may eaſely perceaue both by the meſſage ſent by the Duke of Guienne firſt, and the Conſtables anſwer afterwarn, that this was a compact matter between them, and the rather for that the like meſſage or a more dreadfull came ſoone after from the Duke of Britaine, who ſent alſo to the Kings ſeruice a hundred Britons, all men of armes vnder the leading of the Lord of Leſcut. Wherefore we may boldly ſay that this war was mooued onely to conſtraine the Duke of Burgundy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this mariage, and that they did but abuſe the King in perſwading him to begin war: for they were all in maner lies that they told him of their intelligences in the Dukes dominions. Notwithſtanding, in this voiage the Conſtable did the King great ſeruice, and ſhewed extreme malice againſt the Duke of Burgundy, knowing that the Duke had conceaued mortal hatred againſt him. The Duke of Guienne alſo ſerued the King in theſe wars very well accompanied, ſo that the Duke of Burgundy ſtood vpon hard tearmes. But if at the firſt he would haue aſſured his daughter to the Duke of Guienne, both the ſaid Duke of Guienne, the Conſtable, and diuers other noble men with all their adherents would haue reuolted to him againſt the King, and done their endeuor to haue pulled him vpon his knees. But whatſoeuer man purpoſeth in ſuch caſes, God diſpoſeth afterward of them at his pleaſure.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard at large the cauſe of this war, at the beginning whereof both the Princes were blinded, inuading each other and neither of them knowing the cauſe why, which was a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous cunning of the contriuers of this enterpriſe. For a man might haue pronounced the old Prouerbe of theſe two Princes: that the one part of the world was not acquainted with the others maners nor actions. All theſe affaires aboue reherſed ſince the beginning of theſe wars, chanced in very ſhort ſpace, for within leſſe then fifteene daies after the taking of Amiens, the Duke put himſelfe into the field neere to Arras, (for farther he retired not,) and from thence marched toward the riuer of Somme, and ſo ſtraight to Piquigny, but vpon the waie thither he met with a meſſenger of the Duke of Britaine on foote, who aduertiſed him from the Duke his Maſter, that the King had giuen his ſaid Maſter to vnderſtand of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſecrets, and among others of intelligences he had in many great towns of his dominions: namely Andwerp, Bruges, and Bruxelles, adding alſo that the King was determined to come and beſiege him into what towne ſoeuer he ſhould retire, were it euen into Gaunt. All the which aduertiſements I ſuppoſe the Duke of Britain ſent in fauour of the Duke of Guienne, hoping thereby to further much the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age aboue mentioned. But the Duke of Burgundie tooke this meſſage in euill part, and foorthwith diſpatched the meſſenger, willing him to tell his maſter that he was
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7649:52"/>
miſinformed by ſome euill ſeruants about him, who put theſe feares and doubts into his head, to the end he ſhould not aide him as he was bound by their league. And farther that he knew not what townes Gaunt and the other cities were: in the which he ſaid the King would come to beſiege him: for they were too great to be beſieged. He bad him farther to informe his Maſter in what ſort he found him accompanied, and to aduertiſe him that the world went otherwiſe with him then he ſuppoſed, for he was determined to paſſe the riuer of Somme, and to fight with the King, if he would come to ſtop him vpon the way. Laſte of all, he willed him to deſire his Maſter on his behalfe to ioine with him againſt the King, and to ſhew himſelfe a friend to the Duke of Burgundie, as he had ſhewed himſelfe to him by the treatie of Peronne. The next day the Duke of Burgundie approched neere to a towne vpon the riuer of Somme called Piquigny, the ſeat whereof was meruellous ſtrong. There he determined to make a bridge to paſſe the ſaid riuer, but fower or fiue hundred franke archers, and certaine gentlemen, who by chance lodged at that preſent in the towne, ſeeing the Duke paſſe by, ſalied out to the skirmiſh vpon a long cauſey, and iſſued foorth ſo far from the place, that thereby they gaue the Dukes men occaſion to purſue them, who folowed them ſo ſpeedily that they ſlue a great number of them, before they could retire into the towne, and tooke the ſuburbes into the which the cauſey lead. Then fower or fiue peeces of artilery were bent againſt the towne, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that it were impregnable on that ſide, for that the riuer ran between the towne and the Dukes battery. But theſe franke archers fearing (bicauſe they ſaw the bridge in hand) to be beſieged alſo on the other ſide, abandoned the place and fled. The caſtle held two or three daies and than yeelded alſo by compoſition, and the ſoldiers departed in their doblets and their hoſe. The good ſucceſſe of this ſmall exploit ſo much encouraged the Duke that he led his army before Amiens, where he built two or three lodgings, ſaying that he would keepe the field, to ſee if the King durſt come to fight with him, and in the end approched with his artillerie ſo neer the towne, that it ſhot at randon ouer and into it: in the which eſtate he laie there at the leaſt ſix weeks. Within the towne was the Conſtable and al the great officers of the realme: namely the Lord great Maſter, Admirall, Marſhall, Seneſhals, and others accompanied with foureteene hundred men of armes, and foure thouſand francke archers. The King in the meane time lying at Beauuais made a great muſter, being accompanied with the Duke of Guienne his brother, and <hi>Nicolas</hi> Duke of Calabria, ſonne and heire to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Calabria and Lorraine, and onely heire of the houſe of Aniou. Farther all the nobles of the realme ſubiect to the Arriereban were come thither to him, who trauelled earneſtly (as I haue beene ſince informed) to vnderſtand the bottome of this enterpriſe, for they ſaw the troubles ſo farre from pacification that the King was now more buſied with wars then euer. They within Amiens determined to aſſaile the Duke of Burgundie and his army, if the King would ſend his forces being at Beauuais to ioine with them. But the King being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of this enterpriſe, ſent foorthwith to countermand it: for notwithſtanding that in all apparance the ſucceſſe thereof was like to be good: yet was it not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither voide of danger, eſpecially for thoſe that ſhould haue ſalied: for conſidering that they muſt all haue iſſued foorthwith on foote, and at two gates one of the which was hard by the Dukes campe: if happily they had beene repulſed, they ſhould haue put both the towne and themſelues in great hazard. In the meane time the Duke ſent one of his Pages to the King called <hi>Simon</hi> of Quincy, afterward Bailife of Troy with a letter of ſixe lines written with his owne hand, wherein he humbled himſelfe to him, ſaying that he was very ſorie he had thus inuaded him for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7649:53"/>
other mens pleaſures, which he ſuppoſed he would not haue done, if he had beene well informed of their practiſes. The Kings army ſent into Burgundy <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP3.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> had defeated all the force of the countrie in battell, and taken many priſoners. The number of the dead was not great, but the diſcomfiture was great, in ſuch ſort that the Kings forces had already taken ſome places, and beſieged other ſome, wherewith the Duke was ſomwhat abaſhed, notwithſtanding he made the contrary to be bruted in his campe, ſaying that his army had obtained the victorie.</p>
               <p>When the King had read the Dukes letter aboue mentioned, he reioiced much thereat, both bicauſe of the reaſon aboue alleaged <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP3.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>, and alſo for that he ſoon waxed wearie of all long enterpriſes. Wherefore he gaue him a ſpeedy anſwer, and directed a commiſſion to certaine in Amiens authoriſing them thereby to treate of truce. Whereupon diuers truces were concluded one after another for fower and fiue daies: and in the end one ſo far as I remember for a yeere, to the Conſtables great diſcontentation: for vndoubtedly whatſoeuer men haue thought or can thinke to the contrarie, he was then mortal enimie to the Duke, and many hauty words paſſed betweene them in ſuch ſort, that after this they neuer were friends as the ſequele well declared. True it is that they ſent afterward one to another, but all for practiſe ſake, and each to make his profit by the other. For all that the Duke did was onely to recouer Saint Quintine, which the Conſtable euer when he ſtood in feare of the King promiſed to reſtore, and ſome of theſe treaties betweene them I haue knowen ſo far aduanced, that the Dukes men vpon the Conſtables promiſe to be receiued, haue come within two or three leagues of the towne. But when the matter ſhould be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, he euer continued in his accuſtomed diſſimulation, and ſent a countermaund, which his double dealing coſt him deere in the end. He thought bicauſe of the ſeate of the towne, the great number of men he had vnder his charge paid out of the Kings cofers, and the variance betweene theſe two Princes (which himſelfe nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed) to hold them both in feare, but his enterpriſe was too too dangerous: for they were both too great, too ſtrong, and too ſubtile.</p>
               <p>When theſe armies were diſmiſſed, the King returned into the countrie of Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, the Duke of Guienne into his owne countrie, and the Duke of Burgundy into his: in the which eſtate theſe affaires remained awhile. The ſaid Duke of Burgundy aſſembled all the eſtates of his dominions <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP3.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>, and declared vnto them what damage he had receiued by not hauing ſoldiers in ordinarie pay as the King had: alleaging that if there had beene but fiue hundred men in a readines to defend the frontires, the King would neuer haue mooued this war, but they ſhould haue liued in peace. He ſhewed further what great dangers they were like to fall into if this inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were not ſpeedily redreſſed: and preſſed them earneſtly for the paiment of eight hundred light horſe. In the end they agreed to giue him a ſubſidie of ſixe ſcore thouſand crowns <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP3.NOTE4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> ouer and aboue all other duties they yeerly paid him, in the which ſubſidie Burgundie was not comprehended. But his ſaid ſubiects for diuers reſpects feared to put themſelues into ſuch ſubiection and ſlauerie, as they ſaw the realme of Fraunce in by reaſon of theſe men of armes: which their feare was not without cauſe: for after the Duke had obtained fiue or ſixe hundred men of armes in ordinarie, he ſought continually to encreaſe the number, and began to attempt more boldly againſt his neighbors in ſuch ſort, that in the end theſe 120000. crownes grew to 500000. and the number of his men of armes augmented ſo exceſſiuely, that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects were greatly charged for their maintenance. To ſay my fanſie of theſe ordinarie men of armes, I thinke vnder a wiſe Prince they be well imploied, but if he be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, or happily at his death leaue his children in their minoritie, the ſeruice wherein
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7649:53"/>
their gouernors imploy them is not alwaies profitable neither for the King, nor for his ſubiects. The hatred betweene the King and the Duke diminiſhed not but ſtill endured. Further the Duke of Guienne being returned into his countrie, ſent often to the Duke of Burgundy, following ſtill his ſute for his daughters marriage, who fed him continually with faire words, as he did euery other man that required hir. And I thinke verily that he neither was deſirous of a ſonne <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP3.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref>, neither would haue married his daughter during his life: but haue kept hir to intertaine men, thereby to obtaine their friendſhip and aide. For he had ſo many great enterpriſes in his head, that all his life time could not ſuffice to atchieue them, and thoſe aduentures almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be compaſſed: for halfe Europe would not haue contented him. He had cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ynough to attempt any thing, his bodie was able to endure as much labour and trauell as was needfull, he was furniſhed both of men and mony, but he lacked fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and cunning ſufficient for the managing of his affaires. And what Prince ſoeuer deſireth to be great (notwithſtanding that he be accompliſhed with all other good parts:) yet if he lacke an excellent wit all is to no purpoſe, which vndoubtedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of the meere grace of God. To be ſhort, if part of the Dukes vertues and part of the King our maſters had been tempered togither, they would haue made a perfect Prince: for vndoubtedly in wit the King far excelled him, as it well appeered in the end.</p>

But I will rudely aduertiſe you of all that I haue ſeene, knowen or
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7649:54"/>
heard, of theſe Princes of whom I write. You liue in the ſelfe ſame age that all theſe things hapned, wherefore me thinke it needleſſe ſo exactly to note the houres and ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>I haue before rehearſed what occaſion mooued the Duke of Burgundy to mary King <hi>Edvvards</hi> ſiſter, and ſaid it was principally to fortifie himſelfe againſt the King, otherwiſe he would neuer haue done it, for the great affection he bare to the houſe of Lancaſter, whereof he was deſcended by his mother: for ſhe was daughter to the King of Portugall, and hir mother daughter to the Duke of Lancaſter <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP4.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>, ſo that as feruently as he loued the houſe of Lancaſter, as extremly hated he the houſe of Yorke. But you ſhall vnderſtand that at the time of this mariage, the houſe of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter was vtterly deſtroied, and the houſe of Yorke no more ſpoken of. For King <hi>Edvvard</hi> being both King and Duke of Yorke raigned peaceably. During the ciuill wars betweene theſe two houſes, were fought in England ſeauen or eight cruell bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and in them ſlaine three or fower ſcore Princes and Lords of the blood royall, as before is rehearſed in this hiſtory. The reſt that eſcaped being all yoong Lords, whoſe fathers died in theſe battels aboue mentioned, liued as baniſhed men in the Duke of Burgundies court, who receiued them as his kinſmen of the houſe of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, before his mariage with King <hi>Edvvards</hi> ſiſter. I haue ſeene them in ſo great miſery before they came to the Dukes knowledge, that thoſe that beg from dore to dore were not in poorer eſtate then they: for I once ſaw a Duke of Exceſter run on foote bare legged after the Duke of Burgundies traine, begging his bread for Gods ſake, but he vttered not his name. He was the neereſt of the houſe of Lancaſter, and had maried King <hi>Edvvards</hi> ſiſter <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP4.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>, but when he was knowne, the Duke gaue him a ſmall penſion to maintaine his eſtate. They of the houſe of Somerſet and diuers others, were there in like maner, who died all afterwards in the wars. Their fathers and kinſmen had ſpoiled and deſtroied the realme of Fraunce, and poſſeſſed the greateſt part thereof many yeeres, and afterwards ſlew one another, and thoſe that remained aliue in England and their children haue died as you haue ſeene. Yet men ſay, that God puniſheth not now as he did in the children of Iſraels time, but ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euill men and euill Princes to liue vnpuniſhed. True it is that he threatneth not now by expreſſe meſſengers as he was wont: for he hath left examples inough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct vs. Notwithſtanding you may perceiue by theſe diſcourſes, ioining thereto the great knowledge you haue beſides, that of euill Princes and ſuch as haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this world, and abuſe it to cruelty or tiranny, few or none eſcape vnpuniſhed though it happen not by and by after the fault committed, neither ſo ſoone happily as thoſe that are afflicted deſire. But to returne to King <hi>Edvvard,</hi> the chiefe man in England that maintained the houſe of Yorke was the Earle of Warwicke. And on the other ſide the greateſt champion of the houſe of Lancaſter was the Duke of Sommerſet. The ſaid Earle of Warwicke might iuſtly be called King <hi>Edwards</hi> father, as well for the training of him vp, as alſo for the great ſeruices he did him, for the which the King had alſo highly aduanced him, for beſides his owne inheritance which was great, he held goodly lands of the Kings gift, aſwel crowne lands, as lands forfeited by attaindor. Farther he was deputy of Calice, and had diuers other great offices, ſo that I haue heard his yeerely reuenewes valued at fower ſcore thouſand crownes, beſides his owne inheritance. But in the end he fell at variance with the King his maſter, about a yeere (as I geſſe) before the Duke of Burgundies comming before Amiens: which breach the ſaid Duke furthered to the vttermoſt of his power. For the Earles great authority in England much diſcontented him, beſides that they two were not friends, for the Earle had continuall intelligence with the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7649:54"/>
King our maſter. To be ſhort, about this preſent or not long before, the Earle of Warwickes force was ſo great, that he ſeaſed the King his maſter into his hands, and put to death diuers perſonages that he highly fauored, namely the Lord of Scales the Queenes father <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP4.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>, and two of his ſonnes, (the third being alſo in great danger) &amp; with them diuers other knights. He entertained the King his maſter for a ſeaſon very honorably, and placed new ſeruants about him, ſuppoſing that through ſimplicity he would ſoone forget the old. The Duke of Burgundy being not a little troubled with this aduenture, practiſed ſecretly how King <hi>Edvvard</hi> might eſcape, and they two commune togither, which enterpriſe had ſo good ſucceſſe, that the King eſcaped indeede, and leuied men, and defeated certaine of the Earles bands. He was a fortunate Prince in the field: for he wan at the leaſt nine great battels, figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe on foote in euery one of them. The Earle of Warwicke vnable to make reſiſtance, aduertiſed his friends what they ſhould do, and embarked at leiſure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Duke of Clarence, who had married his daughter and tooke part with him, notwithſtanding that he were King <hi>Edwards</hi> brother. They tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them both wiues and children, and a great band of men, and ſailed ſtraight towards Calais: within the which was the Earles lieutenant named the Lord of Vaucler <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP4.NOTE4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref>, and diuers of the ſaid Earles houſhold ſeruants, who in ſtead of receiuing their Maſter preſented him the canon. Further you ſhall vnderſtand, that as they lay at anchor before the towne, the Ducheſſe of Clarence daughter to the Earle of Warwicke was deliuered of a ſonne, and great intreatie was made, before <hi>Vaucler</hi> and the reſt of the towne would ſuffer two flaggons of wine to be brought foorth to hir, which was great extremitie of the ſeruant towards the maſter. For it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the Earle thought himſelfe well aſſured of this place, which is they very key of England: and the goodlieſt captainſhip in mine opinion in the world, at the leaſt in Chriſtendome: which I dare boldly auow, bicauſe I was there diuers times during theſe wars, and heard alſo the Maior of the ſtaple report, that he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly farme yeerely the deputyſhip of Calais of the King of England for fifteene thouſand crownes. For the deputie receiueth the profits of all that they haue on this ſide the ſea, and of all ſafe conducts, and placeth alſo the greateſt part of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The King of England fauoured highly the Lord of Vaucler for this refuſall made to his Captaine, and granted him by his letters patents the office of Deputie, which the Earle his maſter before held: for he was a wiſe and an ancient knight, and one of the order of the garter. The Duke of Burgundie alſo who then lay at Saint Omer, conceiued a maruellous good opinion of him, ſo far foorth that he ſent me to him, granting him a yeerely penſion of a thouſand crownes, and deſiring him to continue a true and faithfull ſeruant to the King his Maſter as he had begun: which at my comming thither, I found him fully determined to do, ſo that he ſware in Staple Inne in Calais, (laying his hand within mine) to be faithfull and true to King <hi>Edward,</hi> and to ſerue him againſt all men. The like oth all the towne and all the garriſon ſware alſo. Farther I was by the ſpace of two months almoſt continually reſident at Calais, at the leaſt poſting daiely betweene Calais and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to entertaine the ſaid <hi>Vaucler:</hi> for you ſhall vnderſtand that during theſe Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh troubles, the Duke of Burgundie came to Bullen where he prepared a great army by ſea againſt the Earle of Warwick, who at his departure from Calais, tooke many ſhips of the Dukes ſubiects, which aduanced forward the war betweene the King of Fraunce and vs. For the Earles men ſould the bootie in Normandie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke of Burgundie arreſted all the French Marchants that came to the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7649:55"/>
Mart at Andwerp. Now bicauſe it is meete to vnderſtand as well the cunning and ſubtill, as the iuſt and vpright dealings of the world, (not to practiſe them, but to know how to avoide them,) I will rehearſe vnto you a ſleight or ſubtilitie (terme it as you liſt) that was cunningly conueighed. Farther I would that men ſhould vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the practiſes as well of our neighbors as our ſelues, to the end it may appeere that in all places are both good and bad. When the Earle of Warwick came before Calais, thinking to enter into it as his onely refuge: the Lord of Vaucler being a very wiſe gentleman, ſent him word that if he entred the towne he ſhould caſt away himſelfe: conſidering that all England, the Duke of Burgundie, the people of the towne, and a great part of the garriſon: namely the Lord of Duras Marſhall there for the King of England, and diuers others that had men in the towne were his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: wherefore his beſt way ſhould be to retire into Fraunce, and as touching the towne of Calais he willed him not to trouble himſelfe: for he would yeeld him good account thereof when time and occaſion ſhould ſerue. He did his Captaine good ſeruice by giuing him this aduiſe, but ſhewed himſelfe thereby a very <hi>Iudas</hi> to his Maſter. For vndoubtedly a more traiterous part was neuer plaied, conſidering both that the King of England had made him Deputie of the towne of Calais, and the Duke of Burgundy giuen him ſo large a penſion.</p>

All this happened the ſommer before the King ſurpriſed Saint Quintine and Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, which was (as before you haue heard) in the yeere 1470. The Duke of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies nauie aboue mentioned was ſtronger than the Kings and the Earles ioined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. For he had taken at Sluſe many great ſhips of Spaine, Portugall and Genua, and diuers hulks of Almaine. King <hi>Edward</hi> was a man of no great forecaſt, but very
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7649:55"/>
valiant, and the beautifulleſt Prince that liued in his time. He tooke no care for the Earle of Warwicks landing as the Duke of Burgundie did, who perceiuing great tumults already ariſing in England in the Earles fauor, aduertiſed the King often thereof. But he made ſmall account of any danger, neither ſeemed to feare his enimy: which ſure was great follie conſidering the great preparation he ſaw made. For the King armed all the ſhips to the ſea that he could get, and manned them well, and prouided furniture alſo for the Engliſh men.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, he made a mariage betweene the Prince of Wales and the Earle of Warwickes ſecond daughter. The ſaid Prince was onely ſonne and heire to King <hi>Henry</hi> of England, who liued yet priſoner in the Tower of London. This was a ſtrange mariage when the Earle had depoſed and impriſoned the Princes father, to cauſe him to mary his daughter, and to entertaine alſo the Duke of Clarence, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the King of the other faction, who had iuſt cauſe to feare his owne eſtate, if the houſe of Lancaſter recouered the crowne. Thus we ſee that ſuch enterpriſes are not atchieued without diſſimulation. At the ſelfe ſame time that this army aboue mentioned lay in a readines to ſaile into England, I was at Calice to entertaine the Lord of Vaucler, whoſe dooble dealing till that very inſtant I neuer perceiued, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that it had now continued the ſpace of three months. But at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I deſired him (bicauſe of the newes we heard) to put all the Earle of Warwicks houſhold ſeruants being to the number of twenty or thirty out of the towne, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was ſure the Kings army and the Earles were ready to depart out of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy where they lay, and if the Earle ſhould happen ſodainly to land in England, ſome ſuch tumult might ariſe in the towne of Calice by meanes of his ſeruants, that he ſhould not be maſter thereof. Wherefore I preſſed him earneſtly in all haſte to put them out of the towne, which he alwaies heertofore promiſed me to do, but now he drew me aſide ſaying, that he would be maſter of the town well inough, and required me to do this meſſage to the Duke of Burgundy, that if he would be a friend to the realme of England he ſhould endeuor himſelfe to make peace and not war: which words he ſpake bicauſe of the nauy the Duke had on the ſea againſt the Earle of Warwick. He told me farther, that peace might eaſily be made, bicauſe that day a gentlewoman paſſed through Calice to go into Fraunce to the Duches of Clarence with certaine ouertures of peace from King <hi>Edward.</hi> And he ſaid true indeed, but as he abuſed others, euen ſo was he himſelfe deceiued by this gentlewoman: for ſhe went about a great enterpriſe, which alſo ſhe atchieued to the preiudice of the Earle of Warwick, and his whole faction. Of this fine practiſe, &amp; all other that haue been managed on this ſide the ſea, I write the more at large bicauſe I am well aſſured that no man is able to make truer report of them then my ſelfe, at the leaſt of thoſe that haue hapned within theſe twenty yeeres.</p>
               <p>The ſecret deliuered to this woman was to counſell the Duke of Clarence not to cauſe the deſtruction of his owne houſe, by ſetting vp againe the houſe of Lancaſter, but to remember their ancient harred and diuiſion, adding that he might well aſſure himſelfe that the Earle of Warwick hauing maried his daughter to the Prince of Wales, and already done homage to him, would by all meanes poſſible ſeeke to make him King. This gentlewoman ſo wiſely executed the charge committed vnto hir, that ſhe wan the Duke of Clarence, who promiſed to reuolt to the King his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately after his returne into England. Shee was a woman well aduiſed and of few words, and bicauſe of hir ſexe, had leaue granted hir to paſſe to hir Mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres eaſilier then a man ſhould, and as craftie a foxe as this <hi>Vaucler</hi> was, this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man went beyond him, and was the onely contriuer of the enterpriſe, whereby the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7649:56"/>
Earle of Warwick and his whole faction were vtterly deſtroied: wherefore it is no ſhame to be ſuſpicious, and to haue an eie vpon thoſe that paſſe to and fro, but great ſhame it is to be deceiued, and vndone through our owne follie. Notwithſtanding ſuſpicions ought to be grounded vpon ſome good preſumption, for to be too ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious is naught.</p>
               <p>You haue heard, already how the Earle of Warwicks army, and the Kings ſhips appointed to wafte him ouer were in a readines to take ſea, and how the Duke of Burgundies nauie being at Hancy lay prepared to fight with them. But it pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe of this voiage, that the ſelfe ſame night ſo great a tempeſt aroſe that the Dukes nauie was forced to ſeuer: part wherofran vpon the coſt of Scotland, and part into Holland: and not long after the Earle hauing a good gale of winde, paſſed into England without all danger. The Duke of Burgundie had aduertiſed King <hi>Edward</hi> in what part rhe Earle would land, and had ſent men purpoſely to him to ſollicite him to looke to himſelfe: but he litle regarding the danger, paſſed foorth the time in hunting, hauing none ſo neere him as the Archbiſhop of Yorke, and the Marques of Montagu, the Earle of Warwicks bretheren, who had promiſed and ſolemnly ſworne to ſerue him againſt their brother and all others, wereunto he gaue credite. Immediatly after the Earles landing, great forces ioyned with him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the King being much abaſhed, began then, (but all too late) to looke about him, and ſent word to the Duke of Burgundy, deſiring him that his nauie might ſtill keepe the Sea to ſtop the Earle from retiring againe into Fraunce (for vpon the land he would match him well ynough) which meſſage pleaſed no man that heard it: for it had beene much better to haue kept him from landing, then to be conſtrained to hazard his eſtate in battell when he was landed. Fiue or ſixe daies after the Earles arriuall his power was ſo great, that he encamped within three leagues of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> Notwithſtanding the Kings force was greater than his, if all his men had beene faithfull and true, and lay alſo in campe to fight with him. Further you ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the King lodged (as himſelfe told me) in a ſtrong village, at the leaſt a ſtrong houſe into the which no man could enter but by a draw bridge, which was a happy chance for him: the reſt of his armie lay in other villages round about. But as he ſat at dinner, ſuddenly one came running in, and brought newes that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Montague the Earles brother and certaine other were mounted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and had cauſed all their men to crie, God ſaue King <hi>Henry.</hi> Which meſſage the King at the firſt beleeued not, but in all haſte ſent other meſſengers foorth, and armed himſelfe, and ſet men alſo at the barriers of his lodging to defend it. He was accompanied with the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> Lord Chamberlain of England, a wiſe Knight and of the greateſt authoritie about him, who was maried to the Earle of Warwicks ſiſter, yet notwithſtanding was true and faithfull to his Maſter, and had three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe vnder his charge in the Kings armie as himſelfe told me. With the King was alſo the Lord of Scales the Queene of Englands brother, and diuers other vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Knights and Eſquires, who all perceiued that this buſines went not well: for the meſſengers brought word that the report was true, and that the enimies aſſembled to aſſault the King.</p>
               <p>But God ſo prouided for the King that he lodged hard by the ſea ſide, neer a place where a little ſhip laden with victuals that followed his armie, and two hulks of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land fraughted with merchandiſe lay at anchor: he had no other ſhift but to run to ſaue himſelfe in one of them <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP5.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>. The Lord Chamberlaine ſtaied awhile behinde him, and talked with the lieutenant of his band and diuers other particular men in the Kings armie, willing them to go to the enimies, but to beare true and faithfull harts
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7649:56"/>
to the King and him: which talke ended, he went aboord to the reſt being ready to depart. Now you ſhall vnderſtand that the cuſtome in England is, after the victorie obtained, neither to kill nor raunſome any man, eſpecially of the vulgar ſort: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all men then to be ready to obey them, bicauſe of their good ſucceſſe. Wherfore theſe ſoldiers after the Kings departure receiued no harme. Notwithſtanding K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> himſelf told me, that in albattels that he wan, ſo ſoon as he had obtained victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he vſed to mount on horſebacke, and cry too <hi>Saue the people and kil the nobles:</hi> for of them few or none eſcaped. Thus fled King <hi>Edward</hi> the yeere 1470. with two hulks and a little bote of his owne countrie, accompanied with ſeuen or eight hundred perſons, hauing none other apparell than they ware in the wars, vtterly vnfurniſhed of mony, and hardly knowing whither they went. Strange it was to ſee this poore King (for ſo might he now well be called) to flie after this ſort purſued by his owne ſeruants, and the rather, for that he had by the ſpace of twelue or thirteene yeeres liued in greater pleaſures and delicacies than any Prince in his time: for he had who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen himſelfe to dames, hunting, hawking, and banketting, in ſuch ſort that he vſed when he went a hunting in the ſommer ſeaſon, to cauſe many pauilions to be pitched to ſolace himſelfe there with the Ladies. And to ſay the truth his perſonage ſerued aſwel to make court as any mans that euer I knew: for he was yong, &amp; as good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a gentleman as liued in our age, I meane in this time of his aduerſitie: for afterward he grew maruellous groſſe. But behold now how he fel into the trobles &amp; aduerſities of the world. He ſailed ſtraight towards Holland, and at that time the Eaſterlings were enimies both to the Engliſh men and the French, and had many ſhips of war vpon the ſea, wherefore they were much feared of the Engliſh men, and not without cauſe: for they were very good ſoldiers, and had done them great harme that yeere, and taken many priſes. Theſe Eaſterlings diſcried afar off the ſhips wherin the King fled, and ſeuen or eight of them began to make ſaile after him, but in vaine: for he was far before them, and fell vpon the coaſt of Holland or ſomwhat lower: for he arriued in Freezland by a little towne called Alquemare <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP5.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>, as neere the which as was poſſible his mariners caſt anchor: for bicauſe it was ebbing water they could not enter the hauen. The Eaſterlings came in like maner and anchored hard by them, minding to boord them the next tide. Thus we ſee that one miſchiefe neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth without company.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edwards</hi> good ſucceſſe was now cleane altered, and his thoughts quite chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: for not paſt fifteene daies before this misfortune, he would little haue beleeued him that had told him that the Earle of Warwicke ſhould chaſe him out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſubdue the whole country in eleuen daies: for in that ſmal ſpace he brought it to due obedience. Further, he mocked the Duke of Burgundie for ſpending his treaſure in defending the ſea: and wiſhed that the Earle were already landed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But what excuſe could he make now for himſelfe receiuing ſo great loſſe through his owne fault, ſaue this, that ſuch a miſhap was not to be doubted: of which excuſe a Prince growen to mans eſtate ought to be aſhamed, for it will not ſerue. Wherefore let King <hi>Edwards</hi> example teach all Princes that thinke it ſhame to feare their enimies, to be wiſe in time: for notwithſtanding that the greateſt part of their ſeruants through flatterie vphold their ſayings, and that themſelues alſo by ſuch words ſuppoſe to purchaſe an opinion of great courage: yet ſure (whatſoeuer is ſaid to their face) wiſe men account ſuch language but meere folly: for it is great honor to feare that which is to be feared, and to prouide for it accordingly. Further, a wiſe man in a Princes companie is a great treaſure and iewell, if he may be beleeued and haue leaue to ſpeake the truth.</p>

By chance the Lord of Gruteuſe the Duke of Burgundies lieutenant in Holland was at that preſent in the place where King <hi>Edward</hi> arriued, who being aduertiſed by certaine that the King ſent to land, both of his arriuall, and of the danger he was in of the Eaſterlings, gaue commandement foorthwith to the ſaid Eaſterlings not to touch him: and went alſo himſelfe into the Kings ſhip to welcome him.

For the armie that King <hi>Edward</hi> left behinde him, what for loue, what for feare yeelded to him in ſuch ſort, that euery day his forces encreaſed.

I went as far as Tournehan a caſtell neere to Guiens, and further durſt not paſſe, bicauſe I found the people flying for feare of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men, who were abroad and ſpoiled all the countrey. But I ſent foorthwith to the Lord of Vaucler deſiring a ſafe conduct: for before I was accuſtomed to go without any, and was alwaies honorably receiued: for the Engliſh men are verie curteous and honorable in their entertainment. Al this ſeemed ſtrange to me: for I neuer had ſeen ſuch ſudden alterations in the world. I aduertiſed the Duke the ſame night of the danger I ſhould be in if I paſſed further, making no mention of the ſafe conduct I had ſent for, bicauſe I doubted what anſwer I ſhould receiue thereof. The Duke ſent me a ring from his finger bidding me go forward, and if I were taken priſoner he would redeeme me: for he cared not greatly to endanger one of his ſeruants at his neede. But I had prouided well for my ſelfe: for I receiued a ſafe conduct with very curteous letters from the Lord of Vaucler. Wherein he ſent me word that I might go and come after my woonted maner. Whereupon I went to Guiſnes, and founde the captaine at the caſtell gate, who offred me a cup of wine, without that he led me into the caſtel as he was accuſtomed, but he feaſted and entertained honorably theſe gentlemen of King <hi>Henries</hi> faction that accompanied me. From thence I went to Calais, where no man came foorth to receiue me after their woonted ſort, but al men ware the Earle of Warwicks liuery. Further, vpon the gate of my lodging they made aboue an hundred white croſſes and rimes, ſignifying that the King of Fraunce and the Earle of Warwick were all one: all the which ſeemed ſtrange to me. Soone after my comming to Calais, I ſent to Graueling, being but fiue leagues thence, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all Engliſh merchants and merchandiſes to be ſtaied, bicauſe the Engliſhmen had ſo ſpoiled the countrey. The Lord of Vaucler ſent for me to diner, being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, and wearing on his cap a white ragged ſtaffe of gold enamiled <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP6.NOTE2">

It was told me there at diner, that within leſſe than a quarter of an hower after theſe newes came out of England, euery man ware the ſaid cogniſance: ſo ſpeedy and ſudden was the change. This was the firſt time that I began to conſider how vnſtable and vncertaine all worldly things are. The ſaid <hi>Vaucler</hi> gaue me very curteous language, and made certaine excuſes in the Earle his captaines behalfe, rehearſing alſo what great benefits he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at his hands. But as touching the reſt that were with him, I neuer ſaw men ſo far out of frame: for thoſe that I tooke to haue bin the Kings truſtieſt ſeruants, were they that moſt threatned him: ſome I thinke for feare, but others in good earneſt. Thoſe houſehold ſeruants of the Earles, whom I had required the Lord of Vaucler heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to put out of the towne, were now in great credit.

bicauſe of the alterations that had hapned in times paſt, theſe words, <hi>VVith the King and the Realme,</hi> were inſerted into the league, for performance alſo whereof fower of the beſt townes in England were in pledge to the Duke. The merchants required in any wiſe to haue me ſtaied, bicauſe their goods were taken at Grauelin by my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement as they ſaid. In the end peace was thus concluded between them &amp; me, that they ſhould pay for al the cattell they had taken, or reſtore it again: for by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betweene the houſe of Burgundy &amp; them, they might go into certain paſtures thereabout, and take cattel for the prouiſion of the towne, at a price which they now paide, and priſoners they had taken none. Thus it was agreed that the league ſhould remaine firme and vnuiolable between vs and the King and the realme of England, ſaue that for <hi>Edward</hi> we named <hi>Henry.</hi>

Notwithſtanding the rich merchants of London, diuers of the which were then at Calice, in the end perſwaded him to peace, bicauſe their ſtaple of wools is there, which is a far goodlier thing than a man would beleeue: for it is almoſt incredible of how great value the wooll is that is tranſported thither twiſe a yeere, and lieth there till merchants come to buy it. The chiefe vent whereof is into Flaunders and Holland, which was the principall cauſe that mooued theſe merchants to labour ſo earneſtly for peace, and for ſtay of the ſoldiers the Earle was ſending ouer: which ſure was a happy chance for the Duke of Burgundie, for it was euen at the very ſame inſtant that the King tooke Amiens and Saint Quintine: and if both the realmes had made war vpon him at once, vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly he had been vndone.

The ſaid Duke thought now howſoeuer the world went in England he could not ſpeede amiſſe, bicauſe he had friends on both ſides: King <hi>Edward</hi> immediatly after his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, marched ſtraight towards London, bicauſe three or fower hundred Knights and Eſquires of his faction, togither with others of the meaner ſort, to the number of two thouſand and better had retired themſelues into the Sanctuaries of the citie, which was a happy chance for him, for if he landed with ſmall force. The Earle of Warwick being in the north parts with a great armie, hearing theſe newes made haſte to be at London before him, rather for other reſpects than for that he greatly feared the reuolt of the towne, notwithſtanding the contrarie happened. For King <hi>Edward</hi> was receiued into the citie with great ioy and triumph the tueſday before Eaſter, contrarie to the expectation of moſt men, for all the world accounted him as vtterly vndone. And vndoubtedly if they had ſhut the gates againſt him, he had been paſt all recouerie: for the Earle of Warwicke was but a daies iourney behinde him. There were three things eſpecially (as I haue heard) that cauſed the towne to reuolt. Firſt, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were in the ſanctuaries and the yoong Prince lately borne. The ſecond, the great debts that the King owed in the towne, in reſpect whereof the merchants to whom he was indebted thought it their beſt way to take part with him. The third, a great many women of honor and rich merchants wiues, with whom in times paſt he had been familiar, perſwaded their husbands and friends to incline to him. He ſtaied not paſt two or three daies in the towne: for vpon Eaſter euen he departed with all the force he could leuy, and marched againſt the Earle of Warwicke, whom he met the next morning being Eaſter day: and as they ſtood in order of battell, the one in face of the other, ſuddenly the D. of Clarence the Kings brother (who was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the King as before you haue heard) reuolted to the King with twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men and better <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP7.NOTE1">

that the King himſelfe fought in perſon more valiantly than any man of either army. The Earle of Warwick vſed neuer to fight on foote, but his maner was when he had led his men to the charge, to take horſe, and if the victory fell on his ſide to fight among his ſoldiers, otherwiſe to depart in time. But at this battel he was conſtrained by his brother the Marques of Mountacute, a valiant knight, to light on foote and ſend away his horſe. To conclude, in this battell died the Earle and his brother, with a great number of gentlemen, and the ſlaughter of the poore people was alſo great. For King <hi>Edward</hi> at his departure out of Flaunders, reſolued to cry no more to ſaue the people and kill the nobles: but he had conceiued extreeme hatred againſt the communalty of England, both for the great fauor they bare the Earle of Warwick, and for other reſpects alſo: wherefore at this battell he ſpared them not. Of the Kings ſide died about fifteene hundred, and the field was valiantly fought.</p>
               <p>At the time of this battell the Duke of Burgundie lay before Amiens where he receiued letters from the Duches his wife, that King <hi>Edward</hi> hir brother was not a little diſcontented with him, alleaging that the aide he gaue him, was giuen in euil ſort, and with euill will, ſo far foorth that he was almoſt vtterly forſaken of him: and to ſay the truth the King and he after this neuer loued one an other. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Duke ſuppoſing that this victory would greatly further his affaires, cauſed the newes to be publiſhed in all places.</p>
               <p>I had forgotten to tell you how King <hi>Edward</hi> finding King <hi>Henry</hi> at London, lead him with him into the battell aboue mentioned. This King <hi>Henry</hi> was a very ſimple man, and almoſt an innocent: and if I haue not heard a lie, incontinent after the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell the Duke of Gloceſter K. <hi>Edwards</hi> brother, (who afterward named himſelfe K. <hi>Richard)</hi> ſlue this holy man K. <hi>Henry</hi> with his own hands, or cauſed him to be ſlaine in his preſence in ſome ſecret place <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP7.NOTE2">

The Prince of Wales was landed in England when this battell aboue mentioned was fought, hauing in his company the Dukes of Exceſter and Sommerſet, with diuers others of his kinsfolkes and ancient folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his houſe. His army was to the number of forty thouſand, as I haue been infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by diuers that were with him: and if the Earle of Warwicke would haue ſtaied for him, it is very like the victory would haue been theirs. But the Earle feared both the Duke of Sommerſet, whoſe father and brother he had ſlaine: and alſo Queene <hi>Margaret</hi> the Princes mother: wherefore he fought alone and would not tarie for them <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP7.NOTE3">

So ſoone as King <hi>Edward</hi> had obteined this victory, he marched incontinent againſt the Prince of Wales, where another cruell battell was fought: for the Princes force was greater than the Kings, notwithſtanding the lot of victory fell to the King, and the Prince was ſlaine vpon the place <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP7.NOTE4">

In eleuen daies the Earle of Warwicke ſubdued the whole realme of England, at the leaſt brought it to obedience: and in one and twenty King <hi>Edvvard</hi> recouered it, hauing fought two great and cruell battels. Thus you ſee what ſudden mutations haue been in England. K. <hi>Edvvard</hi> cauſed many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be put to death in many places, eſpecially ſuch as had made aſſemblies againſt him.

               <head>How the wars reuiued betweene King Lewis and Charles Duke of Burgundy, by the ſollicitation of the Dukes of Guienne and Britaine. Chap. 8.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Wil now return to our affairs on this ſide the ſea, wherof I haue made no mention ſince the Duke of Burgundies departure from before Amiens, the Kings returne into the country of Touraine, and the Duke of Guienne his brother into Guienne. The ſaide Duke of Guienne continued ſtill his ſute aboue mentioned for his mariage with the Duke of Burgundies daughter, whereunto the ſaid Duke in word euer ſhewed himſelfe willing, but in deede meant nothing leſſe, both bicauſe he purpoſed to vſe hir as an inſtrument whereby to entertaine all the world, and a marchandiſe to put euery man in hope of, and alſo for that he ſtomacked the euill practiſes they had contriued to conſtraine him to this mariage perforce. The Earle of Saint Paul Conſtable of Fraunce buſied himſelfe in this treaty very earneſtly, deſiring that the mariage might ſeeme to be effected by his onely meanes and procurement. On the other ſide the Duke of Britaine traueled therein, to the end the whole honor thereof might redound to him. The King was as buſie as the beſt to breake it off, though needleſly, as well for the two reaſons aboue alleaged, as alſo bicauſe the Duke of Burgundy was not deſirous of ſo great a ſonne in lawe, wherefore in vaine the King troubled himſelfe, but he could not ſee another mans thoughts. And ſure he had iuſt cauſe of feare, for if this mariage had taken effect, his brother ſhould haue beene ſo mighty, that he and the Duke of Britaine ioined togither, might haue put the Kings eſtate and his childrens in great danger. In the meane time about theſe affaires many ambaſſadors paſſed to and fro as well ſecretly as openly.</p>
               <p>This often paſſing to and fro of ambaſſadors is a thing very dangerous: for vnder colour thereof many times euill practiſes are ſet abroch: yet notwithſtanding ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors muſt of force both be ſent and receiued. They that ſhall reade this hiſtorie will aske peraduenture what remedie I can deuiſe againſt this inconuenience, bicauſe it ſeemeth almoſt remedileſſe. For anſwere whereunto I will ſhew mine aduiſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that I know a number far better able to diſcourſe heerof than my ſelfe. Ambaſſadors that come from perfect friends, with whom no occaſion of quarrell can ariſe, muſt be well intertained, and permitted to come often to the Princes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7649:61"/>
I meane if the Prince be wiſe and of comely perſonage, otherwiſe the leſſe he be ſeene the better. Notwithſtanding when he muſt of neceſſitie be ſeene, let him be well apparelled, and well inſtructed what to ſay, and vſe ſhort ſpeech according to Princes amitie, which vſually is but ſhort. But if ambaſſadors be ſent openly or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly betweene Princes that are in continuall hatred and war, as all thoſe haue been that I haue knowen or been conuerſant with in my time, ſure there is great danger therein. Notwithſtanding mine aduiſe is, that ambaſſadors be well intertained and honorably receiued: for to ſend to meete them, to lodge them well, to appoint truſty and wiſe men to accompanie them, are not onely points of great curteſie, but alſo of great ſafetie. For thereby you ſhal both vnderſtand who they are that reſort to them, and alſo ſtay ſuch as be light headed and diſcontented with the preſent eſtate, from bringing them intelligence: for there is no Princes court wherein all haue conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mindes. Further, they muſt haue ſpeedie audience, and ſoone be diſpatched. For me thinke it a perilous matter for a man to harbor his enimie in his houſe, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray them, to lodge them well, and to giue them preſents is but curteſie. Further, in time of open war no practiſe nor ouerture of peace muſt be altogither broken off (bicauſe peraduenture the leſt of them may ſerue vs to good purpoſe) but all muſt be continued and intertained, and all ambaſſadors heard, vſing them as before is ſaid, and appointing ſure watch to eſpie who go to beare them intelligence, and are ſent to them either by day or night: but this muſt be done as ſecretly as may be. Further, for one ambaſſador they ſend to you, ſend you two to them: and though they be wearie of your ambaſſadors, and forbid any more to come: yet ſend ſtill when time &amp; occaſion ſerueth. For no ſpie ſhall haue ſuch libertie to inquire and vnderſtand of all matters as they. And if you ſend two or three togither, it is impoſſible for your enimy to haue ſo good watch (I meane vſing them with good termes as ambaſſadors are to be vſed) but that ſome of them ſhall haue conference and intelligence with one or other. Laſtly, a wiſe Prince muſt alwaies endeuor himſelfe to haue ſome ſecret friend or friends about his enimie, and beware as neere as he may (for in ſuch caſes men cannot alway do as they would) that his enimie haue not the like about him. You will ſay peraduenture that by ſuch often ſending I ſhall increaſe mine enimies inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and pride. But I force not thereof: for by this meanes I ſhall vnderſtand his ſecrets, and in the end all the profit and honor ſhall redound to me. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that mine enimy may deale with me after the ſame ſort, yet wold I not ceaſe from ſending, but intertaine all ouertures and breake off none, to the end I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue occaſion to ſend. For all men haue not like wiſedome, like cunning, nor like experience in theſe affaires, neither like occaſion to trauell for experience, and in theſe caſes the wiſeſt win the garland: whereof I will giue you a manifeſt example. In all treaties of peace concluded betweene the Engliſh and French nations, the French haue alwaies ſhewed more finenes, ſubtiltie, and cunning than the Engliſh, ſo far foorth that the ſaid Engliſh men haue a common prouerbe, as once they told me, when I treated with them: that in all battels fought with the French, euer or for the moſt part they haue obtained honor and victorie, but in all treaties that haue been concluded betweene them they haue euer receiued loſſe and dammage. And ſure in mine opinion I haue knowen in this realme (eſpecially of King <hi>Lewis</hi> his trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp) men as ſufficient to negotiate in a treatie of peace as any in the world. For thoſe that are imploied in theſe affaires muſt be milde men, and ſuch as can beare patiently all rude words to compas their purpoſes for their Maſters profit, and ſuch onely would King <hi>Lewis</hi> imploy. I haue beene ſomwhat long in diſcourſing how am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors actions muſt diligently be obſerued, but not without cauſe: for I haue ſeen
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7649:61"/>
and knowen ſo great falſhood and treacherie vſed vnder colour thereof, that I could no ſooner end my diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>This mariage between the Duke of Guienne and the Duke of Burgundies daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſo earneſtly laboured, that in the end ſome promiſe was made therof both by mouth and letter. But I haue knowen the like done to <hi>Nicholas</hi> Duke of Calabria and Loraine <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP8.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> ſonne to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Calabria ſo often aboue mentioned, and to <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> Duke of Sauoy that laſt died, and to <hi>Maximilian</hi> Duke of Auſtrich now King of Romans onely ſonne of <hi>Frederike</hi> the Emperor, who alſo receiued a letter written with the damſels owne hand by hir fathers commandement, and a diamond there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. All which promiſes were made in leſſe than three yeeres ſpace: yet am I well aſſured that during the Dukes life, none of them ſhould haue been accompliſhed, at the leaſt with his conſent. But this letter aboue mentioned furthered much Duke <hi>Maximilians</hi> ſute, as heereafter you ſhall heare. I write not this to charge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Duke of Burgundie, or any of thoſe aboue mentioned, but onely to rehearſe the courſe of theſe affaires. Further, I perſwade my ſelfe that rude and ſimple men will not buſie their braines about the reading of this hiſtorie: but Princes and Courtiers ſhall finde in it good leſſons and aduertiſements in mine opinion. During this treatie of marriage diuers newe enterpriſes againſt the King were in communication. With the Duke of Burgundie was the Lord of Vrfé, <hi>Poncet</hi> of Riuiere, and certaine other meane perſonages that ran to and fro, for the D. of Guiennes affaires. In like maner the Abbot of Begarde afterward Biſhop of Leon was reſident with him, for the Duke of Britaine. Theſe aduertiſed the Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy that the King practiſed to corrupt the Duke of Guiens ſeruants, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from him, partly by loue, partly by force: adding alſo that he had already razed a certaine place belonging to the Lord of Eſtiſſac, the Duke of Guiennes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and had begun diuers other attempts againſt his brother, ſo far foorth, that he had withdrawne from him certaine of his houſhold ſeruants: whereby appeered manifeſtly (as they ſaid) that he ment to take Guienne from him now as in times paſt he had done Normandy once granted him for his partage as before is mentioned. The Duke of Burgundy ſent diuers ambaſſadors to the King about theſe affaires, who euer excuſed himſelfe <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP8.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>, and accuſed his brother, ſaying that for his part he minded not to touch his brothers partage: but that his brother by ſeeking to inlarge his limits, was author of all theſe troubles.</p>
               <p>We haue heer to conſider how troubleſom, dangerous, and far from all good end the affaires of this Realme are, when it is in diſcord and ciuill diſſention: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that at the beginning of the troubles all men hope ſhortely to ſee them at an end: yet is the contrary greatly to be feared, for though the fire be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the firſt, but betweene two or three Princes or men of meaner eſtate: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two yeeres be exſpired, all our neighbours ſhall be bidden to the banquet, as plainly may appeere by this that followeth. At this very inſtant that I now write of, the D. of Guienne at the leaſt his ſeruants, and the D. of Britaine deſired the Duke of Burgundy in no wiſe to call the Engliſhmen to his aide: for ſeeing all that they did was for the good and benefite of the realme, they would not bring the ancient enimies of the crowne into the realme: adding farther that if he would be in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines they ſhould be ſtrong ynough of themſelues, aſwell bicauſe of their great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as alſo of the good intelligence they had in the realme with diuers Captaines and others. And once it was my chance to be preſent when the Lord of Vrfé had communication with the Duke to this effect, and withall preſſed him earneſtly with all ſpeede to leauy his army. The Duke ſtoode at a window and called me to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7649:62"/>
him and ſaid: Heere is my Lord of Vrfé that preſſeth me earneſtly to leauy the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt force that poſſible I may, alleaging that it ſhall be greatly for the benefite of the realme: what thinke you of this motion if I enter into the realme with my army, ſhall I do any great good there? I anſwered him merily that I thought no: then ſaid he: I loue the realme of Fraunce better than my Lord of Vrfé weeneth, for where it hath one King I would it had ſix.</p>
               <p>During the treaty of mariage aboue mentioned, <hi>Edward</hi> King of England who thought verily that the mariage ſhould haue bin accompliſhed: (wherein he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as was alſo the King) traueled earneſtly with the Duke of Burgundy to breake it off, alleaging that the K. had no iſſue male, wherfore if he hapned to die the crown ſhould deſcend to his brother, whereby (if this marriage tooke effect) the realme of England ſhuld ſtand in great danger, ſo many ſeigniories being vnited to the crown. This matter troubled maruellouſly though needleſly, not onely the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but alſo his whole Councell in ſuch ſort, that they would giue no credite to the Duke of Burgundy, what promiſe ſoeuer he made to the contrary. The ſaide Duke notwithſtanding the requeſt aboue mentioned made vnto him by the Dukes of Guienne and Britaine, for not calling in ſtrangers to his aide, was very deſirous that the King of England ſhould inuade ſome part of the realme, and himſelfe would haue pleaded ignorance therein. But the Engliſhmen would not be woon therunto: for they ſo much feared the annexing of the houſe of Burgundy by this mariage to the crown of Fraunce, that they would at that time rather haue aided the King, than inuaded him. You ſee heere all theſe Princes throughly buſied and accompanied with a number of wiſe men, who (as the ſequele well declared) foreſawe a far of more by the one halfe than in their life time tooke effect: for they all through this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall toile and trauell, in ſhort ſpace one after another ended their liues, each man reioicing at others death as of a thing moſt deſired. Soone after alſo followed their maſters, leauing their ſucceſſors troubles enow, all ſaue the King our maſter who left his realme to his ſonne, quiet both from foraine wars and ciuill diſſention, ſo that he did more for him than euer he either would or could do for himſelfe: for I neuer knew him in peace ſaue onely a litle before his death.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Guienne at this preſent lay ſicke and in danger of death as ſom ſaid, but others affirmed the contrary: his men preſſed earneſtly the Duke of Burgundy to put himſelfe into the field, bicauſe the time of the yeere ſerued fitly for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and aduertiſed him that the Kings army was abroad, and lay at Saint Iohn d' Angelie, or at Xainctes, or thereabout. To be ſhort, they labored the Duke ſo importunately, that he went to Arras, and there aſſembled his forces, and marched towards the townes of Peronne, Roye, and Montdidier: his army was maruellous great, yea the greateſt that euer he had before: for in it were twelue hundred Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his ordinary retinue, euery one of them accompanied with three archers well armed and well mounted: farther in euery company of theſe Launces were ten men of armes for a ſupply, beſides the lieutenant and enſine bearer. The gentlemen of the Dukes dominions were likewiſe in very good order: for they were very well paid and led by valiant knights and eſquires. And ſure at that time theſe countries were maruellous rich.</p>

That he ſhould abandon the Earles of Neuers and Saint Paule Conſtable of Fraunce, and permit the Duke to do with them and all their poſſeſſions at his pleaſure, and ſeize them into his own hands if he could. That the Duke in like maner ſhould abandon the Dukes of Guienne and Britaine, and permit the King to do with them and their ſeigniories at his pleaſure. I was preſent when the Duke of Burgundie ſware this treatie, and likewiſe the Lord of Cran, and the Chauncellor of Fraunce in the Kings name, who alſo at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the Duke aduiſed him not to diſmiſſe his armie, but to march ſtill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to the end the King their Maſter might make the ſpeedier deliuerie of the two places aboue named. Further <hi>Simon</hi> of Quinchy was ſent with them to ſee the King ſweare and confirme this treaty, which his ambaſſadors had concluded: but the King delaied the confirmation a certaine ſpace, and in the meane time happened his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death.</p>
               <p>The D. being readie to depart from Arras receiued two ſeuerall aduertiſements: one that <hi>Nicholas</hi> Duke of Calabria and Loraine, heire of the houſe of Aniou, and ſonne to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Calabria was comming to him about his daughters marriage, whom the Duke honorably receiued, and put in great hope of his ſute. But the next day being the 15. of May 1472. (as I remember) came letters from <hi>Simon</hi> of Quinchy the Dukes ambaſſador to the King, wherein he aduertiſed his Maſter of the Duke of Guiennes death, and that the K. had alreadie recouered a great part of his countrie. The like aduertiſements receiued he alſo incontinent from others, but reporting diuerſly of the ſaid Dukes death. Soone after returned <hi>Simon</hi> of Quinchy from the King with a cold anſwer: for he refuſed to ſweare the treatie, which the Duke tooke very diſdainfully as a matter tending to his contempt and diſhonor. His men alſo in time of war as well for this as other cauſes ſpake very villanous and opprobrious words of the King, and I warrant you the French requited them with the like. The Duke of Burgundie being almoſt out of his wits bicauſe of theſe newes, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of certaine no leſſe ſorie for this accident than himſelfe, writ letters to diuers townes of the realme, charging the King with his brothers death, but little it auailed, for no man ſtirred <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP9.NOTE1">

inuade him, hauing greater intelligences in the realme than euer before: all the which failed by the Dukes death.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Burgundy in this fury put himſelfe into the field, and marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Neſle in Vermandois, making foule and cruell war, contrary to his accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med maner: for he ſpoiled and burned all the countrey as he paſſed. His vaward marched before him, and beſieged the ſaid towne of Neſle being of no force: but the Duke himſelfe lodged three leagues from it. Within the towne were certaine franke archers that ſlew a herald of the Dukes comming to ſummon them. Further, their captaine came foorth to parle vnder ſurety, thinking to bring the matter to compoſition but could not, and as he returned into the towne (the truce yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing bicauſe of his ſaly) they within the towne (notwithſtanding that themſelues ſtood open vpon the wall no man ſeeking to hurt them) ſlew yet two other of the Dukes men, wherfore the truce was diſauowed, &amp; word ſent to the Lady of Neſle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the towne, to come foorth with all hir houſehold &amp; ſtuffe, which ſhe did accordingly: and immediately after, the place was aſſaulted and taken, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of them that were within it ſlaine: all that were taken aliue were hanged, ſaue a few whom the ſoldiers for very pity let go, a number alſo had their hands cut off. It lotheth me to make mention of this cruelty: but bicauſe I was preſent, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what I am forced to write therof. And ſure either the Duke was maruellouſly paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in that he committed ſo cruell an act, or ſome great cauſed mooued him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. He alleaged two, the one the Duke of Guiennes death, wherof he ſpake very ſtrangely vpon other mens report: the other the griefe he had conceiued for the loſſe of Amiens and Saint Quintin aboue rehearſed.</p>
               <p>Some that ſhall read this that foloweth, will thinke happily that there was ſmall faith in theſe two Princes, or that I miſreport them: I would be loth to miſreport ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. And to the King our Maſter, how much I am bound all the world knoweth. But to continue my hiſtory (right reuerend father in God) in ſuch ſort as you haue required, I am forced to vtter that I know howſoeuer it paſſed. And I doubt not but theſe two, being compared with other Princes, ſhall ſeeme noble, woorthy, and honorable, and the King our Maſter wiſe aboue all the reſt, who left his realme enlarged and in peace with all his enimies. Wherefore let vs now conſider whether of theſe two Princes ſought to deceiue the other, to the end that if heereafter this hiſtory happen to fall into the hands of ſome yoong Prince that hath to negotiate in ſuch like affaires, he may by reading thereof be the better inſtructed how to looke to himſelfe. For notwithſtanding that neither Princes nor enimies be alwaies alike, nor deale alike, in like affaires: yet is it good to know the hiſtories of times paſt. To ſpeake therefore vprightly, I thinke both theſe Princes were fully bent each to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue other, and tended both to one end, as you ſhall heare. Both of them had their armies abroad in a readines. The King had already taken diuers places, and during the treaty made ſharpe war vpon his brother, whom the Lords of Courton, Patris, Foucart and diuers others had already relinquiſhed, &amp; were receiued into the Kings ſeruice. Further, his army lay about Rochell, hauing great intelligence in the towne, for the citizens practiſed continually, as well bicauſe of the rumor of this treaty, as alſo bicauſe of the Dukes ſicknes. And I thinke the Kings reſolution was, if he could atchieue his enterpriſe there, or his brother hapned to die, not to ſweare the treaty: but if he found great reſiſtance, to ſweare it, and performe his promiſe, thereby to auoid all danger. And ſure he loſt no time, but vſed great diligence, delaying alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cunningly <hi>Simon</hi> of Quingy the ſpace of eight daies, during the which delay, his brother died: further, he knew well the Duke of Burgundy ſo greatly to deſire the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7649:63"/>
reſtitution of theſe two townes aboue named, that he durſt not flatly fall out with him. Wherefore he meant to delay him, and feed him foorth with faire words fifteen or twenty daies (as he did accordingly) to ſee in the meane time what would happen. Now that I haue ſpoken of the King, and ſhewed how he was purpoſed to deale with the Duke, it is fit I ſhould alſo declare how the Duke was minded towards him, and thought to delude him, had not the Duke of Guiennes death happened. <hi>Simon</hi> of Quinchy by the Kings requeſt had a commiſſion from the Duke his Maſter, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him immediately after the treatie ſworne, and writings deliuered for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof, to go into Britaine to informe the Duke of Britaine of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the peace, and in like maner the Duke of Guiennes ambaſſadors reſident in Britaine, to the end they might aduertiſe their Maſter thereof at Bordeaux: whereby the King meant to put the Britons into the greater feare, when they ſhould ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues abandoned of him that was their chiefe anchor hold.</p>
               <p>Now you ſhall vnderſtand that <hi>Simon</hi> of Quinchy had in his company a rider of the Dukes Eſcuirie called <hi>Henry</hi> a Pariſian borne, a wiſe fellow and of good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: who had a letter of credit to the ſaid <hi>Simon</hi> written with the Dukes owne hand, but his commiſſion was not to deliuer it till the ſaid <hi>Simons</hi> departure from the King, and his arriuall to the Duke of Britaine at Nantes, where his charge was to deliuer him the letter and this meſſage withall. That he ſhould will the Duke of Britaine not to thinke that his Maſter would abandon the Duke of Guienne and him, for he would ſuccour them both with body and goods, and that he had conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this treatie to none other end but to auoid war, and recouer the townes of Saint Quintine and Amiens: which the King in time of peace contrary to his promiſe had taken from him. And further to aduertiſe the ſaid Duke, that the Duke his Maſter would ſend an honorable ambaſſage to the King (ſo ſoone as he ſhould be ſeized of that he demanded) humbly to beſeech him to end this war, and relinquiſh his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe againſt the ſaid two Dukes, and not to giue credite to the oth he had ſworne, which he was no more determined to obſerue, than the King had obſerued the treaty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ade before Paris called the treatie of Conflans: and the treatie which he had ſworne at Peronne, and long after confirmed alſo. Further deſiring him to call to remembrance, that he tooke theſe townes againſt his faith and promiſe in time of peace: wherefore he muſt hold himſelfe contented if he recouered them after the ſame ſort. And as touching the Earle of Saint Paule Conſtable of Fraunce, and the Earle of Neuers whom the King had permitted him to vſe at his pleaſure, he would proteſt, that notwithſtanding he hated them as he had iuſt cauſe to do: yet would he forgiue all their offences, and let them liue in quiet, deſiring the King to grant theſe two Dukes the like: and that it would pleaſe him to ſuffer all men to liue in peace and ſafetie, in ſuch maner and forme as he had ſworne at Conflans, when they were all there aſſembled togither: which if he refuſed to do, he would then ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour his confederates. And it was determined that the Duke ſhould be in campe when this ambaſſage ſhould be ſent to the King. But God diſpoſed otherwiſe of theſe purpoſes: for death which departeth all things, and changeth all determinations, ſet them otherwiſe a worke, as partly you haue vnderſtood already, and ſhall heeraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perceiue more at large: for the King reſtored not theſe two townes, and yet had the Duchie of Guienne by his brothers death, as reaſon was.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow to returne to the war, you haue heard how certaine poore franke archers were handled at the taking of Neſle: thence the D. departed and went before Roye: within the which were 1500. franke archers and certaine men of armes of the Arriereban. The Dukes force was neuer ſo great as at that preſent. The next day after his arriuall, theſe franke archers fearing their liues, leapt downe the wals and yeelded themſelues to him: and the third day they that yet remained within rendered themſelues and the towne by compoſition, leauing behinde them both horſe and harneſſe, ſaue that euery man of armes brought foorth a trauelling nag. The Duke left men in the towne and went to Mondidier which he began to raze, meaning vtterly to deſtroy it &amp; lay it deſolate, but bicauſe of the good wil he perceiued the people of thoſe parts <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP10.NOTE1">

                  </ref> to beare him, he cauſed it to be repaired, and left a garriſon in it. From thence he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, meaning to march ſtraight into Normandie: but as he paſſed hard by Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uais the L. of Cordes who led his vaward, rode to the towne, and at his firſt arriuall the ſuburbs before the Biſhops palace were taken by a couetous Burgundian named Maſter <hi>Iames</hi> of Montmartin: who had vnder his charge one hundred launces, and three hundred archers of the Dukes ordinarie retinue. The Lord of Cordes ſcaled the towne on the other ſide, but he lacked ladders, and thoſe few he had were too ſhort. He had two canons which ſhot twiſe at the towne gate, and brake downe a peece thereof: and if he had been furniſhed to haue continued the ſhot, vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had entred the towne, but he was vnprouided, bicauſe he came not for any ſuch exploite. At his firſt arriuall none were in the towne but the citizens themſelues, and the captaine of the towne called <hi>Loyſet</hi> of Bailligny, with certaine ſoldiers of the Arriereban, but not ynow to defend the place. Notwithſtanding it pleaſed God mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly to preſerue it as he manifeſtly declared. For the Burgundians that were with the Lord of Cordes fought hand to hand with the French at the breach made in the gate: whereupon the ſaid Lord of Cordes ſent word diuers times to the Duke of Burgundie to make haſte thither, aſſuring him that the towne was his owne. But
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7649:64"/>
in the meane time while the Duke was vpon the way, one within deuiſed to throwe flaming fagots in their faces that were about to breake downe the gate: whereof they threw ſo great plentie, that the gate and the porch tooke fire in ſuch ſort, that the Burgundians were forced to retire till the fire ceaſed. Soone after arriued the Duke himſelfe, who in like maner held the towne as taken, the fire being once quenched which was very great, for all the porch was on fire. And vndoubtedly if he had lodged part of his army on the other ſide of the towne towards Paris, no man could haue entred to releeue it. But it pleaſed God he ſhould make doubt where none was: for bicauſe of a little brooke that was to paſſe he made difficultie ſo to do then, and yet afterward when a great number of men were entred the towne he would haue done it, and was hardly diſſwaded from it: notwithſtanding that thereby he ſhould then haue endangered his whole army. All this happened the eight &amp; twentith of Iune in the yeere 1472. The fire aboue mentioned continued all day, and in the euening ten launces onely of the Kings ordinarie retinue entred the towne, as I was afterward informed: for I ſerued yet the Duke of Burgundie, but we ſaw them not enter, both bicauſe euery man was buſied in making his lodging: and alſo bicauſe we had no force on that ſide the towne. By breake of day the Dukes battterie was bent againſt the wals: but ſoone after we ſaw two hundred men of armes enter the towne: and had it not beene for their comming, I thinke the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens would haue treated of a compoſition: which notwithſtanding the Duke in this fury would neuer haue granted: for he deſired to take the towne by aſſault, and if he had ſo done, vndoubtedly he would haue burnt it, which had been great pitie: ſure it was preſerued by very miracle. After theſe men of armes were entred, the Dukes artillerie ſhot continually the ſpace of fifteen daies, and the place was as well beaten as euer was any, in ſuch ſort that the breach was ſaultable: but the ditch of the one ſide of the burned gate ſtood full of water, ſo that we were forced to build a bridge ouer it: but on the other ſide we might come hard to the wals without any danger, ſaue of one flanker which was ſo low that our artillerie could not beat it.</p>
               <p>It is great danger and folly to aſſault a towne ſo well defended as this was: for within it was the Conſtable <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP10.NOTE2">

                  </ref> (as I remember) or lay by it, I wot not wel whether, the Marſhall <hi>Ioachin,</hi> the Marſhall of Loheac, the Lord of Cruſſoll, <hi>VVilliam</hi> of Valleu, <hi>Mery</hi> of Croy, <hi>Sallezarde, Theuenot</hi> of Vignoles, being all ancient captaines, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an hundred men of armes of the Kings ordinary retinue: beſides a great number of footemen and others that were come thither with them. Yet the Duke contrary to the opinion of his whole army, determined to giue the aſſault. And the night before, as he lay on his field bed in his clothes, according to his accuſtomed maner, he asked certaine there preſent, whether they thought the town would abide the aſſault: who anſwered that they thought yea, ſeeing they were force ſufficient to defend it: at the which anſwer he ſcoffed, ſaying that they ſhould not finde a man there the next day. In the morning by breake of day the aſſault was giuen very couragiouſly, and the breach no leſſe valiantly defended. A great number went thronging on our new made bridge in ſuch ſort, that an ancient knight of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy called <hi>Deſpiris</hi> was ſmothered there, who was the beſt man that died before the towne. On the other ſide of the gate certaine of our men got vp to the top of the wall, but ſome of them neuer returned. They fought hand to hand a great while, and the aſſault continued ſo long, that freſh bands were appointed to ſucceede, the firſt being wearied: but bicauſe the Duke ſaw his men to labor in vaine, he cauſed them to retire: yet notwithſtanding they within ſalied not, for they ſaw company ynough ready to receiue them. At this aſſault were ſlaine twelue hundred ſoldiers <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP10.NOTE3">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7649:65"/>
the beſt man that died there was the aboue named <hi>Deſpiris.</hi> It was thought at the firſt that many more had been loſt: for aboue a thouſand were hurt. The next night they within ſalied foorth, but bicauſe their number was ſmall, and the moſt of them on horſebacke, and therby encombred with the cords of our tents, they did no great exploit, but loſt two or three gentlemen of their company, and hurt one of ours na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Maſter <hi>Iames d'Orſon,</hi> a very honeſt gentleman, and maſter of the Dukes Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, who a few daies after died of the ſaid hurt.</p>
               <p>Seauen or eight daies after this aſſault, the Duke would haue diuided his army into two bands, and lodged part thereof at the gate towards Paris, contrary to all mens aduiſe and to all reaſon, conſidering the great number of ſoldiers within the town. This ſhould haue been done at the beginning, but now it was too late. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing no remedy, he raiſed his campe in very good order <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP10.NOTE4">

But bicauſe of the Duke of Guiennes death, he altered his minde, and ſtirred not out of his country. The Duke of Burgundy came before Eu, which was yeelded vnto him, as was alſo Saint Valery, and he burnt all this quarter euen hard to Diepe. He tooke likewiſe Neuf-chaſtell, and burnt both it and all the country of Caux, or the greateſt part, euen hard to Roan gates: further, he preſented himſelfe in perſon before the ſaid towne of Roan: he loſt many of his foragers, whereby his army was in great diſtreſſe of victuals.

For as he knew the Duke of Britaines forces, being gouerned by ſo woorthy a man, greatly to be feared: ſo was he aſſured if he could win the Lord of Leſcute to his ſeruice, that the Britons would labor for peace, bicauſe he was their onely man of wiſdome and experience in the countrey: beſides that, generally the Britaines deſire nothing more than peace with Fraunce: bicauſe continually a great number of them haue good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be in good eſtimation in this realme, &amp; not vnwoorthily: for ſure in times paſt they haue done great ſeruice heere. Wherefore me thinke the King did very wiſely in concluding this treaty, notwithſtanding that ſome not conſidering ſo deepely thereof as himſelfe did, thought otherwiſe of it. He had a very good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord of Leſcute, &amp; knew there was no danger in putting thoſe offices and places of charge that he did into his hands, bicauſe he was a man of honor, &amp; would neuer during theſe diuiſions haue any intelligence with the Engliſh men, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that the townes in Normandie <ref target="#S5602.BK3.CHAP11.NOTE2">

                  </ref> ſhould be yeelded to them, but had beene the onely ſtay thereof, which was the cauſe of all his preferment. When the King had well debated this matter, he commanded <hi>Souſplenuille</hi> to put in writing all that his Maſter required, as well for the Duke as himſelfe: which done, the King granted him all his demands being theſe: A penſion of 80000. franks for the Duke: for his maſter the Lord of Leſcute a penſion of 6000. franks, the gouernment of Guienne, the two Seneſchalſhips of Launes and Bordelois, the captainſhip of one of the caſtels of Bordeaux, the captainſhip of Blaye, and of the two caſtels of Bayonne, of Dax, and of Saint Seuer, 24000. crownes in ready mony, the Kings order, and the Earldome of Comminges. All the which the King granted and agreed vnto, ſaue that the Dukes penſion was diminiſhed by the one halfe, and continued but two yeeres. Further, the King gaue the ſaid <hi>Souſplenuille</hi> 6000. crownes (which with the other 24. thouſand giuen to his Maſter were to be paid in fower yeeres) a penſion of 1200. franks, the Mayraltie of Bayonne, the Bailywick of Montargis, and certaine other ſmall offices in Guienne. All the which aboue rehearſed eſtates, his Maſter and he enioied till the Kings death. <hi>Philip d'Eſſars</hi> likewiſe was made Bailife of Meaux, and lieutenant of the waters and forreſts throughout the realme of Fraunce, and had alſo a penſion granted him of 1200. franks, and 4000. crownes in ready money: all the which offices and eſtates from that day till the King our Maſter his death they quietly enioied, and the Lord of Comminges continued during his life his truſtie and faithfull ſeruant.</p>
               <p>The King hauing pacified all matters in Britaine marched ſtraight toward Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: for he and the Duke of Burgundie vſed alwaies when winter approched, to make truce for ſixe moneths, or a yeere, and ſome time more. After the which their woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted maner they made truce at this preſent, which the Chancellor of Burgundie with certaine others came to the King to conclude. There the Kings Commiſſioners read the finall peace made with the Duke of Britaine, whereby the ſaid Duke renounced the league he was entred into with the Engliſh men and the D. of Burgundie: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King required the Duke of Burgundies ambaſſadors not to comprehend the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7649:66"/>
Duke of Britaine in the truce as their confederate: whereunto they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend, but agreed that the Duke of Britaine ſhould be at his choiſe to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe within the time accuſtomed, either the Kings confederate or theirs: alleaging that heertofore alſo the ſaid Duke had abandoned them by writing, yet had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from their friendſhip. Further adding, that though he were a Prince wholy led and gouerned by others, and doing little of himſelfe: yet in the end he euer yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that which was beſt and moſt neceſſary for his eſtate. All this was done in the yeere 1473.</p>
               <p>During this treatie they murmured on both ſides againſt the Earle of Saint Paule Conſtable of Fraunce: for the King and thoſe that were neereſt about him had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued maruellous hatred againſt him. And the Duke of Burgundy hated him woorſe than they, as he had iuſt cauſe to do: for I know the reaſons that mooued them both to beare him ill will. The Duke had not yet forgotten that he was the onely occaſion of the loſſe of Amiens and Saint Quintin, and perceiued well that he nouriſhed this war betweene the King and him. For in time of truce he ſpake him as faire as was poſſible, but ſo ſoone as the war opened, he ſhewed himſelfe his mortall foe. Further, the Earle had ſought to conſtraine him by force to marrie his daughter to the Duke of Guienne, as before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ue heard. Beſides all this there was yet another grudge: for while the Duke lay before Amiens, the Conſtable made a road into Henault, and among other cruell exploits burned the caſtell of Seure, belonging to a Knight na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Maſter <hi>Baudouin</hi> of Launay: before the which time they vſed on neither ſide to fire any place. But in reuenge thereof the Duke this laſt ſommer burned the countrie all the way his armie paſſed, as before you haue heard. Thus they began to practiſe the Conſtables deſtruction: for the accompliſhment whereof diuers of the Kings men conferred with ſuch of the Dukes ſeruants as they knew to be his mortall eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: for the French had him in as great iealouſie as the Duke of Burgundie had, and accuſed him as the onely occaſion of the war: wherefore all his treaties and practiſes with both parties were ripped vp and diſcouered, and they both ſought his death.</p>
               <p>Some man may peraduenture aske heerafter, if the King alone were not of power ſufficient to put him to death: whereunto I anſwer that he was not. For his lands lay iuſt in the middeſt betweene the King and the Duke: further, he held Saint Quintin a great and ſtrong towne in Vermandois, and of his owne Han, Bohain, and other very ſtrong places neere to the ſaid Saint Quintin, the which he might man at all times with any nation at his owne pleaſure. He had charge vnder the King of fower hundred men of armes well paied, of the which companie himſelfe was controller and tooke the muſter, which was no ſmall profit to him: for his companies were not complete. Beſides all this he had a yeerely penſion of 45000. franks, and of euerie tunne of wine that paſſed through his countrie into Flaunders or Henault, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a crowne for impoſt. He had alſo goodly ſeigniories and poſſeſſions of his owne inheritance, and great intelligence as well in Fraunce as in the Dukes dominions, where he had many kinsfolks and allies.</p>
               <p>The truce betweene the King and the Duke continued a whole yeere: all the which ſpace this practiſe endured, and the Kings men addreſſed themſelues wholie to the Lord of Hymbercourt (ſo often before named,) who of long time had beene the Conſtables enimy: beſides that, their hatred was lately increaſed. For in an aſſembly held at Roye, where the Conſtable and others were commiſſioners for the King: and the Chancellor of Burgundy and the Lord of Hymbercourt, with diuers others for the Duke: as they conferred togither of their affaires, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7649:66"/>
gaue the lie very ſhamefully to the ſaid <hi>Hymbercourt,</hi> who anſwered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that he would not beare this reproch at his hands, were it not in reſpect of the Kings honor, vnder whoſe ſafe conduct he was come thither as ambaſſador, and of the Duke his Maſter whoſe perſon he repreſented, and to whom he would make report of this iniurie done vnto him. This onely villanie and outrage ſo ſoone done, coſt the Conſtable both lands and life as heereafter ſhall be declared more at large. Wherefore thoſe that are in authority, yea and Princes themſelues ought to take great heed how they iniurie any man by word or deed, and whom they iniurie: for the greater they are, the greater greefe and ſorrowe is conceiued of their words, bicauſe they that are iniuried thinke that the great authority of the perſon that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurieth them, will cauſe them the more to be marked and noted. And if he be their Maſter or Prince they vtterly diſpaire of benefite or good turne at his hands: and moſt men ſerue rather for the good they hope to haue, than for that they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready receiued.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the point, the Kings men practiſed continually with <hi>Hymber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> and likewiſe with the Chancellor, as well bicauſe the words ſpoken at Roye touched him in part, as alſo bicauſe of the neere friendſhip that was between Hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercourt and him. And the matter was ſo earneſtly preſſed, that an aſſembly was held about it at Bouuines a towne neere to Namur, whither the King ſent the Lord of Courton gouernor of Lymoſin, and Maſter <hi>Iohn Heberge</hi> afterward Biſhop of Eureux: and the Duke the ſaid Chancellor and <hi>Hymbercourt,</hi> being the yeere 1474.</p>
               <p>The Conſtable being informed that they practiſed at Bouuines to his coſt, ſent with all ſpeede to both the Princes, aduertiſing them he vnderſtood of all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſo cunningly he wrought, that he perſwaded the King that the Duke meant nothing but deceit, onely to allure the ſaid Conſtable to his friendſhip: whereupon with all ſpeed the King ſent to his ambaſſadors at Bouuines, commanding them to conclude nothing againſt the Conſtable for certain reaſons he would declare vnto them, but to prolong the truce according to their inſtructions, for a yeere or ſixe moneths I wot not well whether. But when the meſſenger arriued, he found the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie already concluded, and the writings ſealed and deliuered the night before. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ambaſſadors had ſo good intelligence togither, and were ſo great friends each to other, that they deliuered the writtings backe againe: the contents whereof were, that the Conſtable for the reaſons therein rehearſed, was declared enimie and traitor to both the Princes: who promiſed and ſware each to other, that whether of them could firſt lay hands on him, ſhould either put him to death within eight daies, or deliuer him to the other to do with him at his pleaſure. It was alſo therein concluded, that he ſhould be proclaimed by ſound of trumpet enimy to both the Princes, and likewiſe all that ſhould ſerue, helpe, aide, or fauour him. Further, the King promiſed to deliuer to the Duke the towne of Saint Quintin, ſo often before mentioned, and to giue him all the Conſtables treaſure and moouables that ſhould be found in the realme of Fraunce, with all ſuch ſeigniories and lordſhips as were held of the ſaid Duke, and among the reſt Han and Bohain, which are two very ſtrong places. Laſtly, a day was appointed when both the King and the Duke ſhould ſend their forces to beſiege him in Han. Notwithſtanding for the reaſons aboue rehearſed, this concluſion was cleane broken off, and a day and place aſſigned where the Conſtable ſhould come to commune with the King vnder ſafe conduct: for he ſtood in doubt of his perſon, bicauſe of the late treatie held at Bouuines. The place aſſigned was three leagues from Noyon neere to the towne of La Fere, vpon a pretie riuer which no man could paſſe, bicauſe the Conſtables men had taken vp all the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7649:67"/>
bridges. In the ſaid place was a narrow cauſey, ouerthwart the which a ſtrong grate was built, whither the Conſtable came firſt, accompanied with all his men of armes, or the greateſt part: for he had with him aboue three hundred gentlemen all men of armes: and he himſelfe ware his quirace vnder a ſhort gowne vngirt. The King came accompanied with the Earle of Dampmartine Lord great Maſter of Fraunce, the Conſtables mortall enimie, and with ſixe hundred men of armes and better, and ſent me before him to make his excuſe to the Conſtable of his long ſtay: and ſoone after arriued himſelfe, and they communed togither: at which their communication were preſent fiue or ſixe of the Kings ſeruants, and as many of the Conſtables, who excuſed his comming thither in armes, bicauſe he ſtood in feare of the Earle of Dampmartin as he ſaid. To be ſhort, in the end it was agreed that all offences paſt ſhould be forgiuen and forgotten: and the Conſtable paſſed through the grate to our ſide of the riuer, where the Earle of Dampmartin and he were made friends. That night he lodged with the King at Noyon, and the next morning returned to Saint Quintin throughly reconciled as he ſaid. But when the King had well weighed this matter, and heard the murmuring of the people, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelfe of great folly in going after this ſort to commune with his ſeruant, &amp; ſtomaked not a little, that he found the grate ſhut between them, conſidering that all the Conſtables men of armes were his ſubiects and paide out of his coffers: wherfore if his hatred againſt the Conſtable were great before, ſure this meeting much increaſed it: and as touching the Conſtable, his proud ſtomack was no whit abated.</p>

This his dooing peraduenture himſelfe and his familiar friends accounted a woorthy exploit: ſuppoſing the King to ſtand in feare of him, whom alſo they repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a timorous Prince. And true it is that he was ſo at times when there was cauſe why: but not alwaies when the world ſo iudged of him. For you ſhall vnderſtand, that the ciuill wars with the Princes of his realme, out of the which he had wound himſelfe by large gifts and promiſes, had beaten this leſſon into his head, not to put any thing in aduenture if he could compaſſe his purpoſes by any other means: which cauſed a number of men to ſuppoſe all his dooings to proceede of feare. But diuers that vpon this imagination attempted fooliſh enterpriſes againſt him, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues much deceiued, namely, the Earle of Armignack and others, whom their fond attempts coſt full deere. For the King knew when it was time to feare, and not to feare. Sure this praiſe I dare boldly giue him (which though happily I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before, yet deſerueth againe to be ſpoken) that he was the wiſeſt man in aduerſity that euer I knew. But to returne to my diſcourſe of the Conſtable, who deſired per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture to hold the King in feare, at the leaſt I ſuppoſe ſo (for I will not charge him with it, but write this onely for an aduertiſement to thoſe that are in Princes ſeruice, and vnderſtand not all alike the affaires of this world:) for mine owne part, if I had a friend, I would aduiſe him to endeuor himſelfe that his Maſter might loue him, not feare him: for I neuer knew man whoſe authority depended of the feare his Maſter had of him, that ſped not euill in the end, and that by his Maſters conſent. Examples ynow haue been ſeene heerof in our time, or not long before. In this realm of the Lord of Trimouille and others: In England of the Earle of Warwick and his faction. I could name ſome alſo in Spaine and in other countries. But thoſe that ſhal reade this diſcourſe may peraduenture be able to ſay more therin than my ſelfe. This their preſumption oftentimes proceedeth of their good ſeruice: for they thinke their experience ſo great that they cannot be ſpared, and their deſerts ſuch that their Maſters ought to beare all things at their hands. But Princes on the contrarie ſide both ſay and thinke, that men are bound to do them ſeruice, and deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to be rid of ſuch malapart fellowes. Touching the which point, I muſt needes ſpeake ſomewhat of the King our Maſter: for once he told me in talking of thoſe that do their Prince great ſeruice (naming withall his author from whom he receiued this opinion) that good ſeruice ſometime vndooeth men: and is recompenſed with great ingratitude, not alwaies by the Maſters forgetfulnes, but many times through the ſeruants owne fault: who preſuming vpon their good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, behaue themſelues arrogantly, either towards their Maſters or their fellowes: Further, as touching thoſe that come to preferment in Court, this was his opinion: that he is happier that receiueth a benefit of the Prince he ſerueth, without great deſert, whereby he ſtandeth bound to his Prince: than he that hath done ſo great ſeruice, that his Prince ſeemeth in debted to him: adding, that he for his part loued thoſe better that were bound to him, than thoſe to whom he was bound. Thus you ſee how hard it is to liue in this world in any eſtate: wherfore greatly are they bound to God, whom he hath indued with vnderſtanding how to gouerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their vocation.

I with others wiſer than my ſelf were appointed to make report of theſe conditions to the yoong Duke, who anſwered vs, that he had rather throw his father headlong into a Well, and himſelfe after, than agree to ſuch an appointment, alleaging that his father had been Duke forty fower yeeres, and that it was now time for him to gouerne.

Wherefore the Duke prolonged the truce with the King. Some of the Kings ſeruants were of opinion, that the King did vnaduiſedly to prolong the turce, and ſuffer the Duke to grow as he did. And ſure they had ſome apparance of reaſon to leade them ſo to ſay, but bicauſe they lacked experience and had not ſeene the world abroad, they wiſt not what the matter meant.

                     <hi rend="sup">11</hi>

The Lantz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue, as I haue ſaid, was brother to the Biſhop elected, againſt him whom the Duke of Burgundy defended, who laide his ſiege before Nuz in the yeere 1474.</p>
               <p>His force was neuer ſo great as then, eſpecially of horſemen: for bicauſe he meant to attempt ſomewhat in Italie, he had in pay a thouſand Italian men of armes good and bad, vnder the leading of one called the Earle of Campobache a Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan borne of the houſe of Anious faction, a dangerous and a traiterous fellow. In the Dukes campe ſerued alſo <hi>Iames Galeot</hi> a valiant gentleman of Naples, and diuers others, whoſe names for breuitie I paſſe ouer. Further, he had in his armie three thouſand Engliſh men excellent good ſoldiers, and of his owne ſubiects a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous number well armed, and who long had been trained vp in the wars, beſides great force of goodly peeces of artillerie: all the which preparation he put in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines to ioine with the Engliſh men at their landing, who vſed as great diligence in England as they could. But it is long before an army can be leuied there, bicauſe the King may attempt no war before he haue aſſembled his court of Parlament, being the ſame in effect that the three eſtates in Fraunce, which me thinke is a very good and a laudable cuſtome. For the King by that meanes is the ſtronger and the better ſerued in all enterpriſes he taketh in hand with the conſent of his eſtates, to whom when they are aſſembled he declareth his intent, and deſireth aide of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects: for no ſubſidie is leuied in England, but for inuaſion of Fraunce or Scotland, or ſuch like enterpriſes of great charge, which then the people grant willingly and liberally, eſpecially to paſſe into Fraunce: wherefore the Kings of England vſe often when money faileth them to leuy an armie, and make ſhewe as though they would inuade Scotland or Fraunce. But after they haue receiued money for a yeere, they lie abroad in campe three moneths, and then returne home and diſmiſſe their army: which practiſe King <hi>Edward</hi> was well acquainted with and vſed often.</p>
               <p>It was at the leaſt a yeere before this Engliſh army could be in a readines, but when it was furniſhed of all things neceſſarie, the King of England aduertiſed the Duke of Burgundie die thereof, who in the beginning of the ſommer went before Nuz, truſting in ſhort ſpace to put his Biſhop in poſſeſſion, and to retaine certaine places, as Nuz and others in his owne hands, to what purpoſe you haue heard before.</p>
               <p>I thinke verily that this proceeded of God, who beheld with a pitifull eie this realme of Fraunce: which vndoubtedly the Duke might ſhrewdly haue ſhaken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that his army was mightie and all of olde ſoldiers, accuſtomed by the ſpace of many yeeres to enter and ſpoile this realme without any reſiſtance, ſaue onely
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7649:69"/>
by defence of the ſtrong townes. True it is that this proceeded of the King who would hazard nothing, partly for feare of the Dukes force, and partly for doubt of rebellion in his realme if he ſhould receiue an ouerthrow: for he knew himſelfe not to be beloued of all his ſubiects, eſpecially the nobilitie. And (if I may vtter all) he hath eftſoons told me, that he knew his ſubiects well ynough, and ſhould finde them rebellious if his aſſaires happened to haue hard ſucceſſe: wherefore when the Duke of Burgundie entred into the realme, he manned the townes well by the which he paſſed: whereby in ſhort ſpace the Dukes army brake it ſelfe, and the King neuer endangered his eſtate: which vndoubtedly proceeded of great wiſedome. But all this notwithſtanding the Dukes force being ſo great as it was: if the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands army had alſo entred in the beginning of ſommer, (as aſſuredly it would, had not the Duke ſo obſtinately line before Nuz,) vndoubtedly the realme had ſtood in great danger: for neuer King of England paſſed at once with ſo great force, nor ſo well diſpoſed to fight. All the great Lords of England were there none excepted. Their men of armes were 1500. at the leaſt, (which was much for the Engliſh men) all wel appointed and well accompanied, and 14000. archers on horſeback, beſides a great number of foote men that ſerued in the army, and in all their campe was not one Page. Further, the King of England had in a readines three thouſand men to land in Britaine, to ioine there with the Duke of Britaines forces. I ſaw my ſelfe two letters written with the Lord of Vrfés owne hands, (then ſeruant to the Duke of Britaine, but afterward Maſter of the horſe to King <hi>Charles:)</hi> the one addreſſed to the King of England, and the other to the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> Lord great Chamberlaine of England <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP1.NOTE12">

It is not to be doubted but that they receiued a good anſwer with promiſe of all they demanded: further, the King aſſured by letters as well the Emperor as diuers Princes and townes, that ſo ſoon as the Emperor with his army ſhould be come to Coulon, he would ſend twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand men to ioin with him, vnder the leading of the Lord of Cran and Salle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarde.

the Emperors force was alſo this other army aboue mentioned, which lay directly ouer againſt the Duke on the other ſide of the riuer, and endamaged greatly his campe, and cut off much of his victuals.</p>
               <p>When the Emperor and the Princes of the Empire were come before Nuz, they ſent to the King a Doctor of great authoritie with them called <hi>He ſeuare,</hi> afterward a Cardinall, who came to ſollicite the King to performe his promiſe, and ſend the forces whereof he had aſſured the Emperor by letters, otherwiſe to tell him that the Almaines would conclude peace.</p>
               <p>The King put him in good hope that he would ſo do, and gaue him a preſent of fower hundred crownes, and ſent with him to the Emperor one called <hi>Iohn Tiercelin</hi> Lord of Broſſe: notwithſtanding the Doctor departed nothing well contented. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this ſiege maruellous practiſes were entertained. The King trauelled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude peace with the Duke of Burgundie, at the leaſt to prolong the truce, to the end the Engliſh men ſhould not paſſe the ſeas. The King of England on the other ſide labored to the vttermoſt of his power to perſwade the Duke to depart from Nuz, and performe his promiſe by aiding him to make war in Fraunce, alleaging that the ſommer was far ſpent. And the Lord of Scalles a curteous Knight, nephew to the Conſtable of Fraunce, with diuers others, was twiſe ſent ambaſſador to the Duke to ſollicite him thereunto: but he was obſtinate. Whereby it manifeſtly appeered, that God had troubled his wits and vnderſtanding: for all his life time he had labored the Engliſh men to paſſe into Fraunce, and now when they were in a readines, and all things prepared for the wars as well in Britaine as elſewhere, he lay obſtinately before a place impregnable. With the Emperor was a legate ſent from the Pope, who rode daily betweene the two camps to treate of peace. The King of Denmarke came alſo thither, and trauelled to pacifie this controuerſie, being lodged in a little towne hard by both the armies: ſo that the Duke might haue departed to the Engliſh men with honorable conditions. Notwithſtanding he would not, but excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the King of England vpon his honor, which he ſaid ſhould be ſtained if he leuied his ſiege, with diuers ſuch like ſlender excuſes. Heere you muſt note, that theſe were not thoſe Engliſh men that in the time of Duke <hi>Philip</hi> his father had made war ſo long in this realme, but theſe were yoong ſoldiers vtterly vnacquainted with our French affaires. Wherefore the Duke proceeded very fondly if he meant to vſe their helpe: for he ſhould the firſt ſommer haue been continually with them, leading them from place to place, and inſtructing them what was to be done.</p>
               <p>While the Duke lay thus obſtinately before Nuz, war aroſe againſt him on two or three ſides: for the Duke of Lorraine, who hitherto had been in peace with him, ſent to defie him before Nuz, by the Lord of Crans perſwaſion, who to further the Kings affaires allured the Duke of Lorraine thereunto, aſſuring him that it would turne greatly to his profit. Incontinent the ſaid Duke of Lorraine put himſelfe into the field, and ſpoiled all the Duchie of Luxembourg, and razed a place there called Pierre-forte, two leagues from Nancy. Further, by the Kings procurement and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his ſeruants, a league was made for ten yeeres betweene the Swiſſers and certaine townes vpon the riuer of Rhene <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP2.NOTE4">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout this time the truce ended between the King and the Duke, to the Kings great griefe, who gladly would haue prolonged it, but ſeeing no remedie, he went and beſieged a little caſtel called Tronquoy in the yeere 1475. in the very beginning of ſommer, the pleaſanteſt time of the yeere. The caſtell in ſhort ſpace was taken by aſſault. The next day the K. ſent me to parle with them that were within Montdidier, who yeelded the place, &amp; departed with bag &amp; baggage. Thence I went the third day being accompanied with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of Fraunce baſtard of Bourbon, to parle with them that were within Roye, who

Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding both theſe townes were burned contrarie to our promiſe. Thence the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and laid his campe before Corbie which abode the ſiege. Goodly approches were made to the towne, and the Kings artillerie bet it three daies: within it was the Lord of Contay <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP3.NOTE1">

                  </ref> and diuers others, who yeelded the place, and departed with bag and baggage: two daies after, this poore town was alſo ſacked and burned as the two former. Then the King thought to repaire home with his armie, truſting to perſwade the Duke of Burgundie to make truce, conſidering the diſtreſſe he was in. But a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lady whom I know well, yet will not name bicauſe ſhe is ſtill liuing, writ him a letter, willing him to leade his armie to Arras, and into thoſe parts: whereunto the King agreed, for ſhe was a woman of honor. I commend hir not in thus doing: for ſhe was in no reſpect bound to the King. The King ſent thither the Lord Admirall baſtard of Bourbon with a great band of men, which burned many townes in thoſe quarters, and ſpoiled all the countrie betweene Abbeuille and Arras: whereupon the citizens of Arras, who were puffed vp with pride bicauſe of their long proſperity, compelled the garriſon of the towne to iſſue foorth. But being too weake to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Kings forces they were put to flight, and purſued ſo ſpeedily that many of them were ſlaine and taken, togither with all their captaines, namely, Maſter <hi>Iames</hi> of Saint Paule <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP3.NOTE2">

               <p>The King ſent to the Emperor (as you haue heard) <hi>Iohn Tiercelin</hi> Lord of Broſſe, partly to ſollicite him not to make peace with the Duke of Burgundy, and partly to make his excuſe for not ſending his forces according to his promiſe: and further, to aſſure him, that he would ſhortly ſend them, and would alſo continue to ſpoile and endamage the Dukes dominions, as well in the marches of Burgundy <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP3.NOTE3">

                  </ref>, as alſo in Picardy. Laſtly he made him a new ouuerture, which was, that they ſhould ſweare each to other, not to make peace the one without the other, and that the Emperor ſhould ſeaze into his hands all the ſeigniories that the Duke held, and ought to hold of the Empire, and proclaime them forfaited to him, and he would do the like with all thoſe that were held of the crowne of Fraunce, namely Flaunders, Artois, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy and the reſt. The Emperor though all his life time he had made ſmall ſhew of any valor, yet was he wiſe and of great experience, bicauſe of his ancient yeeres. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe practiſes between vs and him had continued ſo long that he waxed weary of the wars, notwithſtanding that they coſt him neuer a grote. For all the Princes of Almaine lay there vpon their owne charge, as their maner is when the war con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the ſtate of the empire. The Emperor anſwered the Kings ambaſſadors after this ſort: There was ſomtime neere to a certaine city in Germany, a great Beare that much endamaged the countrie, three good fellowes of the which city being tauerne haunters, came to a tauerne where they were indebted, deſiring their hoſt yet once more to giue them credit, promiſing him within two daies paiment of the whole debt: for they would take this Beare that did ſo much harme in the countrey, whoſe skin was woorth a great ſum of money, beſides the preſents that good folkes would giue them, whereunto their hoſt agreed: and when they had dined, foorth they went toward this beaſts caue, neere to the which when they approched, they met with the Beare vnlooked for, and being ſtricken with ſudden feare fled, one got vp into a tree, the other fled towards the towne, but the third the Beare tooke and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7649:72"/>
and foiled vnder hir feete, holding hir muſſell hard to his eare. The poore ſoule lay flat vpon the ground, as though he had been dead. Now you ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the nature of a Beare is ſuch, that whatſoeuer ſhe holdeth in hir clawes man or beaſt, ſo ſoon as ſhe ſeeth it leaue ſtirring, ſhe foorthwith forſaketh it, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to be dead, as alſo this Beare left this poore fellow, not doing him any great harme, and returned to hir den. Then he ſeeing the danger paſt, aroſe and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the towne. But his fellow that ſtood in the tree hauing beheld all this pageant, came downe and ran crying after him to ſtay: and when he had ouertaken him, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to tell him faithfully what counſell the Beare gaue him in his eare, whereto ſhe held hir muſſell ſo long: whereunto his fellow anſwered, that ſhe bad him neuer to ſell the Beares skin till the Beare were ſlaine. And with this fable paid the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror our King, not giuing his ambaſſadors any further anſwer, as though he ſhould haue ſaid, come hither according to your promiſe, and let vs take this Duke if we can, and then make partition of his goods.</p>

The practiſe begun againſt him ſtill continued, which as you haue heard was almoſt concluded at the aſſembly held thereabout at Bouuines: after the which, the Conſtable neuer thought himſelfe in aſſurance, but miſtruſted both the Princes, eſpecially the King, who ſeemed to repent the reuoking of his letters there ſealed. Further, the Earle of Dampmartin &amp; others whom the Conſtable feared as his enimies, lay with their men of armes neere to Saint Quintins: wherefore he held himſelfe within the towne, and put into it three hundred footemen of his owne tenants, hauing but ſmall affiance in his men of armes. He liued in great trouble, for the King had often ſent to him to ſollicite him to come foorth to do him ſeruice in the marches of Henault, and to beſiege Auennes at the ſame time that the Admirall with his band went to burne the countrey of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois as you haue heard, which commandement he obeied but with great feare: for after he had lien a certaine ſpace before the ſaid towne of Auennes with a continual garde about his perſon, he retired into his owne places, and ſent the King word by one of his ſeruants (who did his meſſage to me by the Kings commandement) that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7649:72"/>
he had raiſed his ſiege, bicauſe he was certainly enformed, that there were two in the army purpoſely hired by the King to kill him: whereof alſo he told ſo many apparant tokens, that he ſeemed indeed to haue ſome notice thereof, ſo far foorth that one of them was ſuſpected to haue diſcloſed ſomwhat to him, that he ought to haue kept ſecret: but I will name no man, neither ſpeake further heerof. The Conſtable ſent often to the Duke of Burgundies campe, I ſuppoſe to perſwade him to relinquiſh his fooliſh enterpriſe, aduertiſing the King alſo vſually at his mens returne of ſome ſuch newes as he thought would like him well, and withall what was the cauſe of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thither, hoping by this means to entertaine him with faire words. Somtime alſo he gaue him to vnderſtand, that the Dukes affaires had good proceeding, thereby to put him in feare.

The Duke did as he required, and when the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iames</hi> the Lord of Fiennes, and the reſt of the Conſtables kinſmen were twiſe come within a league or two of the towne ready to enter, the Conſtable thinking the ſtorme paſt, altered his minde, and ſent a countermaunde. This did he thriſe: ſo deſirous was he ſtill to liue in diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, and ſwim as it were between two ſtreams, fearing maruellouſly both theſe Princes.

The ſaid Maſter <hi>Iames</hi> anſwered frankly and without diſſimulation to all the Kings demands, whereby he wan greatly his fauor.

Then the King inquired further, if he had entred and had been Maſter of the towne, whether he would haue held it for the King or the Conſtable. Whereunto he likewiſe anſwered, that the two firſt times he came but to comfort his brother, but the laſt (ſeeing his diſſimulation to his Maſter and him) if he had entred and had been Maſter of the towne, he would haue held it for his Maſter, not offring his brother any outrage, nor doing any thing to his preiudice, ſaue onely that he would not haue departed the town at his commandement.

The force that paſſed with him at this preſent was the greateſt that euer came into France, all of them being on horſeback in very good order and well armed. All the nobles of the realme were there, a fewe excepted: they were 1500. men of armes very well mounted, and the moſt of them barded, and richly trapped after the maner of our wars, and well accompanied with horſemen of their retinue. They were at the leaſt 15000. archers all mounted, and a great number of footemen and others, aſwell to pitch their tents, (wherefore they were well furniſhed) as alſo to attende vpon their artillerie and incloſe their campe, and in all their army they had not one Page: beſides theſe there were three thouſand Engliſh men appointed to land in Britaine. This I haue written before, but rehearſe it heere againe, to the end you may perceiue that God was purpoſed to trouble the

Duke of Burgundies wits, and preſerue this realme which he hath euer more fauored than any other: otherwiſe it is to be thought that the Duke would ſo obſtinately haue lien before Nuz, a place ſo ſtrong &amp; ſo well defended, ſeeing all his life time till now he could neuer finde the Engliſh men diſpoſed to inuade the realme of Fraunce, and knew them to be vtterly vnacquainted with our French wars till they be trained therein: for if he would haue done any good with them, he ſhould neuer haue left them the firſt ſommer, but helped them and taught them to order and leade their battels after the maner of our wars: for there is no nation ſo ignorant and rude as the Engliſh men at their firſt landing in Fraunce, but in very ſhort ſpace they becom excellent good ſoldiers, hardie and wiſe. But the Duke did cleane contrarie: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe other his ouerſights, he made them loſe the ſommer: and as touching him ſelfe, his armie was ſo broken, ſo poore, and in ſo euill order, that he durſt not preſent it before them: for he loſt before Nuz fower thouſand ſoldiers taking pay: ſome of the which were the beſt men he had <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP5.NOTE4">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Muſt yet ſpeake a word or two more heer of the Conſtable, who was not a little troubled, as well for the lewd touch he had plaid the Duke of Burgundy about the reſtitution of Saint Quintins, as alſo bicauſe he ſaw himſelfe vtterly disfauored of the King, ſo far foorth that his cheefe ſeruants, namely the Lords of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Mouy had alreadie relinquiſhed him, and were in the Kings ſeruice: notwithſtanding the ſaid <hi>de Mouy</hi> reſorted ſtill to him ſometime. Further, the King preſſed the Conſtable earneſtly to come to him, offering to make him ſuch recompence for the countie of Guiſe as he required, and the King had often promiſed him. The Conſtable was willing to go, ſo that the K. would ſweare by the croſſe of S. Lou of Angiers to do him no harme, nor conſent that any other ſhould: alleaging that he might as wel ſweare therby now as in times paſt he did to the Lord of Leſcute: whereunto the King anſwered, that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer giue that oth to any man <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP6.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>, but any other he would not refuſe to ſweare. You may eaſily geſſe how much both the King and the Conſtable were troubled: for that no day eſcaped for a certaine ſpace but one or other paſſed betweene them about this oth. Wherefore if we well weigh our eſtate, mans life is very miſerie: for we toile and trauell our ſelues to ſhorten our owne daies, ſaying and writing a number of things cleane contrarie to our thought. To conclude, if theſe two were troubled on the one ſide, I warrant you the King of England and the Duke of Burgundie were no leſſe troubled on the other.</p>
               <p>At one time in a maner, both the King of England landed at Callice <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP6.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> and the Duke of Burgundie departed from before Nuz, who in great haſte rode ſtraight to Callice to the ſaid King with a very ſmall traine: for he had ſent his armie in ſuch poore eſtate, as you haue heard, to ſpoile the countrie of Barrois and Lorraine, to the end they might there make merrie and refreſh themſelues: which he did, bicauſe the Duke of Lorraine had begun war vpon him, and defied him before Nuz. But this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his forces into Lorraine, among diuers other his ouerſights in his actions with the Engliſh men was not the leſt: for they thought at their landing to haue found him with 2500. men of armes well appointed, and great force of other horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and footemen (for ſo he had promiſed, thereby to allure them to paſſe the ſeas:) and further, that he would haue made war in Fraunce three moneths before their arriuall, to the end they might finde the King the wearier and the weaker: but God as you haue heard, diſpoſed otherwiſe of this matter. The King of England departed from Callice in companie of the Duke of Burgundie, and paſſed through Bolaine, and from thence to Peronne, where the Duke gaue the Engliſh men but cold enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment: for he cauſed the gates to be ſtraightly garded, and would ſuffer but few to enter, ſo that the greateſt part of them lodged in the fields, as they might well do: for they were well prouided of all things neceſſarie for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>After they were come to Peronne, the Conſtable ſent to the Duke of Burgundy one of his ſeruants called <hi>Levvis</hi> of Creuille, by whom he excuſed himſelfe: for the withholding of Saint Quintins, alleaging that if he had reſtored it, he could haue
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7649:75"/>
ſtood him in no ſtead in the realme of Fraunce: for he ſhould vtterly haue loſt his credit and intelligence there, but now ſeeing the King of England was come ouer in perſon, he promiſed to do heerafter all that the Duke ſhould command him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the better to aſſure him, he ſent him a letter of credit directed to the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but referring the matter of credit to the declaration of the Duke. Further, he gaue the Duke his faith in writing, to ſerue and ſuccour him, his friends and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, as well the King of England as others, againſt all men none excepted. The Duke deliuered the King of England his letter, and withall the matter of credit, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſomwhat thereto of his own deuiſe: for he aſſured the King that the Conſtable would deliuer into his hands both Saint Quintins and all his other places: which the King eaſily beleeued, partly bicauſe he had maried the Conſtables neece, and partly bicauſe he ſaw him in ſo great feare of the King our Maſter, that he thought he durſt not faile of his promiſe made to the Duke and him, and the Duke beleeued it alſo. But the Conſtable meant nothing leſſe, for the fear he ſtood in of the King our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was not ſo great that it could force him ſo far. But he vſed ſtill his woonted diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, hoping by theſe faire meſſages to content them, and ſhew them ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant reaſons of his dooings, that they would not as yet conſtraine him to declare himſelfe. Now you ſhall vnderſtand that King <hi>Edvvard</hi> and his men were nothing acquainted with our affaires, but went bluntly to worke, ſo that they could not as yet ſmell out the cunning vſed heere on this ſide the ſea: for naturally the Engliſh men that neuer trauelled abroad are very colerick, as are alſo al people of cold cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP6.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>. The realme of Fraunce as you ſee is ſituate betweene both: for it is inuironed with Italy, Spaine and Catalonia towards the eaſt <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP6.NOTE4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                  </ref>, and all along the countrey of Champaigne, Almaine bordereth vpon it: ſo that our countrey taketh part both of heate and cold, wherfore the French are of two complexions: but in mine opinion I neuer ſaw countrey in my life better ſeated than the realme of Fraunce.</p>
               <p>The King of England who reioiced maruellouſly at this meſſage ſent by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable (although happily he had receiued ſome ſuch promiſe before, but not ſo large) departed from Peronne with the Duke of Burgundy (who had no force there, for his army was in Barrois and Lorraine) towards Saint Quintins, whereunto when they approched, a great band of Engliſhmen ran before, thinking (as I heard it reported a few daies after) that the bels ſhould haue rung at their comming, &amp; that the citizens would haue receiued them with croſſe and holy water. But when they drew neere the town, the artillery ſhot, and the ſoldiers iſſued foorth to the skirmiſh, both on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe and foote, ſo that two or three Engliſh men were ſlaine, and ſome taken. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it rained terribly, and in this eſtate returned they in great rage to their campe, murmuring againſt the Conſtable and calling him traitor.</p>
               <p>The next morning the Duke of Burgundy would haue taken his leaue of the King of England to depart to his army into Barrois, promiſing to do maruels in his fauor. But the Engliſh men who naturally are ſuſpicious, and were ſtrangers in theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, maruelled much at his ſo ſudden departure, (ſeeing they had paſſed the ſeas at his requeſt) and were greatly diſcontented therwith, neither would they beleeue that his army was in a readines. Beſides that, the Duke could by no meanes repaire the Conſtables former credit with them: notwithſtanding that he affirmed all his dooings to be to a good end. The winter alſo which drew neere diſmaied them, ſo that they ſeemed by their words deſirous rather of peace than war.</p>

               <head>How the King clothed a poore ſeruant in a cote armor with a ſcutchin, and ſent him to ſpeake with the King of England in his Campe, where he receiued a very good anſwere. Chap. 7.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the meane time, euen at the very inſtant that the D. of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy was taking his leaue, the Engliſh men tooke priſoner a gentlemans ſeruant of the Kings houſe named <hi>Iames</hi> of Graſſe, whom foorthwith they led to the King of England and the Duke being togither, and from them into a tent: where when they had examined him, the Duke tooke his leaue to go into Brabant, and from thence to Maizieres, where part of his army lay. The King of England commanded the ſaid ſeruant to be diſmiſſed, bicauſe he was their firſt priſoner. And at his departure the Lord <hi>Hovvard</hi> and the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> gaue him a noble ſaying: Do our humble commendations to the K. your Maſter if you can come to his preſence. The fellow came in great haſte to the King being at Compiegne with theſe newes, who foorthwith began to ſuſpect him as a ſpie, bicauſe <hi>Gilbert</hi> of Graſſe his Maſters brother, was then very well entertained in the Duke of Britaines court, wherefore he was committed to warde, and ſtraightly kept that night. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the King commanded diuers to commune with him, by whoſe report his tale ſeemed voide of all ſuſpicion and feare. Wherefore they deſired the King to vouchſafe to heare him, and according to their requeſt the next morning he himſelfe ſpake with him, and when he had heard him, his irons were knocked off, but he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtill in warde. Then the King went to diner debating with himſelfe whether he ſhould ſend to the Engliſh men or not. And before he ſat downe talked three or fower words thereof with me. For you know (my Lord of Vienna) that oftentimes he communed very familiarly with thoſe that were neere about him, as I was then, and others after, &amp; loued to talke in a mans eare: he called then to minde the herault of Englands aduiſe, which was, that he ſhould not faile to ſend to the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſo ſoone as he was landed, to demaund a ſafe conduct for certaine ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors that he would ſend to him: and further, to adreſſe his herault to the aboue named Lord <hi>Hovvard</hi> and the Lord <hi>Stanley.</hi> After the King was ſet to diner, and had muſed a while, as you know his maner was (which ſeemed ſtrange to thoſe that knew him not: for vnleſſe a man had beenwel acquainted with his behauior, he would haue iudged him of no great wiſdome, notwithſtanding that his dooings ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the contrary) he bad me in mine eare to ariſe and dine in my chamber, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7649:76"/>
ſend for a certaine ſeruant of the Lord of Halles, ſon to <hi>Merichon</hi> of Rochell, and to commune with him, to know whether he durſt aduenture to go to the K. of Englands campe in a heraults cote: which his commandement I executed foorthwith, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling much when I ſaw the ſaid ſeruant: for he ſeemed to me neither of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage nor behauior fit for ſuch an enterpriſe: notwithſtanding he had a good wit and a very pleaſant toong, as I afterward perceiued: the King had neuer ſpoken with him before but once. The ſaid ſeruant was maruellouſly aſtoniſhed with my meſſage, &amp; fell downe before me on his knees, as one accounting himſelfe a dead man, but I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted &amp; confirmed him the beſt I could, promiſing him an office in the Ile of Ré, &amp; a ſumme of money, &amp; to cheere him the better, tolde him that this proceeded of the Engliſh men themſelues. Then I made him dine with me, none being preſent but we two, and one of my ſeruants, and by little and little perſwaded him to do as he was required. After I had been at diner a while, the King ſent for me, and I told him how I had wrought with this good fellow, naming diuers others, who in mine opinion ſeemed fitter for this purpoſe than he, but the King would none but him. Wherfore he came and talked with him himſelfe, and confirmed him more with one word, than I had with an hundred. None entred into the chamber with the King ſaue onely the Lord of Villiers, then Maſter of the horſe, and now bailife of Caen. When the King perceiued this good fellow to be well perſwaded to go: he ſent the ſaid Maſter of the horſe to fetch a trumpet banner, thereof to make this counterfet herault a cote armor: for the King bicauſe he was not pompous as other Princes are, had neither herault nor trumpeter with him. Thus the Maſter of the horſe and one of my men made his cote armor as well as they could: which being finiſhed, the ſaid Maſter of the horſe fetched a ſcutchin of a little herault of the Lord Admirals called <hi>Plein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemin,</hi> which was faſtened to our counterfet herault: his bootes alſo and his cloke were brought priuily to him, and likewiſe his horſe: whereupon he mounted no man vnderſtanding any thing of his iourney. Further, a goodly budget was tied to his ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle bowe, into the which he put his cote armor. Thus being well inſtructed what to ſay, he rode ſtraight to the Engliſh campe: where when he arriued with his cote ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor on his backe, he was ſtaied incontinent, and brought to the King of Englands pauilion. Where being demanded the cauſe of his comming, he ſaid that he came from the King to ſpeake with the King of England, and had commandement to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe himſelfe to the Lord <hi>Hovvard</hi> and the Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> whereupon they led him into a tent to diner, and made him good cheere. After the King of England was riſen from the table (for he was at diner when the herault arriued) the ſaid herault was brought before him, and the King gaue him audience. His meſſage was chiefely grounded vpon the great deſire the King had of long time to be in perfect amitie with the King of England, to the ende both the realmes might liue togither in peace and quietnes: adding further, that ſince the time he was firſt crowned King of Fraunce, he neuer had attempted any thing againſt the King of England or his realme <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP7.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>: ſecondarily, he excuſed himſelfe for receiuing in times paſt the Earle of Warwicke into his dominions, ſaying that he did it onely againſt the Duke of Burgundie and not againſt him. Further, he declared vnto him that the ſaid Duke of Burgundie had for none other cauſe called him into Fraunce, but that by the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his comming he might conclude a better peace for himſelfe with the King. And if happily any others were furtherers thereof, it was onely to amend the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſtate of their owne affaires, and for their owne priuate commoditie: but as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the King of Englands good ſucceſſe, they were altogither careleſſe thereof: he put him alſo in minde of the time of the yeere, alleaging that winter approched,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7649:76"/>
and likewiſe of the great charges he ſuſtained: laſtly he ſaid, that notwithſtanding a great number in England, as well gentlemen as merchants deſired war with France: yet if the King of England would incline to peace, the King for his part would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend to ſuch conditions, as he doubted not but he and his realme would allow of: laſtly, to the ende he might the better be informed of all theſe matters, he ſaid: that if the King of England would grant a ſafe conduct for an hundred horſe, the King his Maſter would ſend ambaſſadors to him well informed of their Maſters pleaſure, or if the ſaid King of England ſhould like better to aſſigne the place of treatie in ſome village betweene both the armies, and to ſend Commiſſioners thither on both ſides, the King his Maſter would willingly agree thereunto: and ſend the like ſafe conduct for his part.</p>
               <p>The King of England and part of his nobles liked theſe ouuertures very well, and granted our herault as large a ſafe conduct as he demanded, &amp; gaue him fower no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of gold <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP7.NOTE2">

                  </ref> in reward. Further, an Engliſh herault was ſent backe with him to the King, to bring the like ſafe conduct from him as the King of England had granted. And the next morning in a village neere to Amiens the Commiſſioners of both Princes met, being theſe: for the King, the baſtard of Bourbon Admirall of Fraunce, the Lord of Saint Pierre, and the Biſhop of Eureux called <hi>Heberge:</hi> and for the King of England the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> one called <hi>Chalanger</hi>

               <p>Some may thinke peraduenture that the King humbled himſelfe too much, but thoſe that be wiſe will eaſily perceiue by that I haue aboue rehearſed, in how great danger the realme ſtood, had not God put to his helping hand, as well in cauſing the King to take this wiſe courſe, as alſo by troubling the D. of Burgundies wits, who committed ſo many errors as you haue heard in this action, &amp; loſt now through his owne follie that which ſo long he had wiſhed for and deſired. Many ſecret practiſes lay hidded at that time among our ſelues, as well in Britaine as elſewhere, which would ſoone haue broken foorth into great inconueniences, had not this peace beene ſpeedily concluded. Wherefore I aſſure my ſelfe by that I haue ſeene in my time, that God had then, and yet hath a ſpeciall regard of this realme.</p>

That the King that now is then <hi>Daulphine</hi> ſhould marrie King <hi>Edwards</hi> eldeſt daughter at this day Queene of England, and that ſhe ſhould haue the Duchy of Guienne for hir maintenance, or 50000. crownes yeerely to be paied in the Tower of London by the ſpace of nine yeeres: which terme expired, the King that now is and his wife ſhould peaceably enioy the reuenues of the whole Duchie of Guienne, and then the King our Maſter to be cleerely diſcharged of all paiments to the King of England. Diuers other trifling articles there were, touching matter of trafike, which I ouerpaſſe. Laſtlie, this truce was to endure nine yeeres betweene the two realmes: all the confederates of both parties being comprehended therin, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the King of Englands behalfe, the Dukes of Burgundie and Britaine if they themſelues would. Further, the King of England made a maruellous ſtrange offer, which was, to name in writing certaine noble men, who he ſaid were traitors to the King and his crowne. The King reioiced maruellouſly at the report that his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners made at their returne, &amp; ſat in counſell about theſe ouertures of peace: where among others I my ſelfe was preſent. Some ſuppoſed all this treatie to be meere deceit and cunning of the Engliſh men, but the King was of a contrarie opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: for he alleaged firſt the time of the yeere, ſaying, that winter now approched, and that they had not one place to lodge in: ſecondarily, he declared the euill turns the Duke of Burgundie had done them, who was alſo departed from them. And as touching the Conſtable he did in maner aſſure himſelfe, that he would put no places into their hands, bicauſe he ſent howerly to him to entertaine him, to aſſwage his malice, and to keepe him from doing harme: laſtly, he alleaged the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands diſpoſition, whom he knew well to be a Prince wholy giuen to his pleaſures &amp; delights. Wherfore he ſeemed to diſcourſe wiſelier than any man of the companie, and better to vnderſtand than any other the matters there debated. He concluded therefore with all ſpeed to pay this ſumme of mony, and deuiſed order how to leuie it, and in the end commanded that euery man ſhould lend a portion the ſooner to furniſh it: for the King cared not what he did to rid the King of England out of his realme, ſaue onely that he would in no wiſe conſent to put any places into the Engliſh mens hands: for rather than he would ſuffer that, he was fully determined to hazard all.</p>
               <p>The Conſtable who began to ſmel theſe practiſes, was ſtricken with ſudden feare, bicauſe he had offended all the three Princes. Further, he doubted much the treatie almoſt concluded againſt him at Bouuines. Wherefore he ſent often to the King, and euen at this preſent arriued at the Court one of his gentlemen named <hi>Levvis</hi> of Creuille, with one of his Secretaries called <hi>Iohn Richer</hi> who are both yet liuing. They deliuered their meſſage to the Lord of Bouchage and me before they ſpake with the King, as his pleaſure was they ſhould. The newes they brought liked the King well, bicauſe he meant to vſe them to good purpoſe as you ſhall heare. The Lord of Contay (ſeruant to the Duke of Burgundie) lately taken priſoner before Arras as you haue heard, went to and fro vpon his word betweene the Duke and the King: and the King had promiſed to releaſe him his raunſome, and to giue him a great ſumme of money if he could perſwade his Maſter to peace. By chance he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7649:77"/>
to the King the ſelfeſame day that theſe two ſeruants of the Conſtables ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued. Wherefore the King made him and me to ſtand in a great old preſſe in his chamber, to the end he might heare and make report to his Maſter, of the language the Conſtable and his ſeruants vſed of him. We being there placed, the King ſate downe on a forme hard by the preſſe, to the end we might the better heare <hi>Lewis</hi> of Creuilles and his companions meſſage. Who began thus, that of late being by their Maſters commandement with the Duke of Burgundie, to perſwade him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Engliſh mens friendſhip: they found him in ſuch a rage againſt the King of England, that they had almoſt woon him not onely to abandon the Engliſh men, but alſo to helpe to ſpoile and deſtroy them in their returne home. And in vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe words (the better to pleaſe the King) the ſaid <hi>Lewis</hi> of Creuille counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting the Duke of Burgundies geſture by ſtamping vpon the ground and ſwearing Saint <hi>George,</hi> rehearſed many reprochfull ſpeeches that (as they ſaid) the Duke vſed of the King of England. To be ſhort, they vttered as many ſcofs and mocks of the D. as was poſſible. The King made great ſport with this matter, &amp; bad the ſaid <hi>Lewis</hi> of Creuille to ſpeake alowd, faining himſelfe to be growen ſomwhat deafe, and to tel him this tale againe: which the other making no bones thereat, did with a good will.</p>
               <p>The ſaid <hi>Contay</hi> (who ſtood with me in the preſſe) was maruellouſly aſtoniſhed at this talke, neither would haue beleeued it vnleſſe himſelfe had heard it. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables mens concluſion was this. They counſelled the King, for auoiding of all theſe great dangers he ſawe hang ouer his head, to conclude a truce (for the which the ſaid Conſtable offered to trauell to the vttermoſt of his power:) and to put into the Engliſh mens hands (the better to content them) ſome ſmall towne or two to lodge them in this winter, ſaying, that were they neuer ſo bad, yet the Engliſh men would holde themſelues contented with them. And it ſeemed by their talke, though they named no place, that they ment Eu and Saint Valery. By this meanes the Conſtable truſted to recouer the King of Englands fauor, which he had loſt bicauſe of the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall made him of his places. But the King who thought it ſufficient to haue plaied his part by bringing the Lord of Contay to heare what language the Conſtable and his men vſed of the Duke his Maſter, gaue them no euill anſwer, but ſaid that he would ſend to his brother <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP8.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>, to aduertiſe him of ſuch newes as he knew, and ſo licenſed them to depart. Notwithſtanding, one of them before his departure ſware to reueale vnto him whatſoeuer he could learne touching him or his eſtate. The King had much adoo to diſſemble any longer when he heard them counſell him to put townes into the Engliſh mens hands. Notwithſtanding, he gaue them no ſuch anſwer, whereby they might gather their counſell to be taken in euill part (bicauſe he feared that would the more increaſe the Conſtables malice:) but ſent one backe with them to their Maſter: it was not far betweene him and vs, for a man might go and come in very ſhort ſpace. When the others were departed, the L. of Contay &amp; I came out of the preſſe: the K. laughed maruellouſly, and was very mery with this pageant. But the ſaid <hi>Contay</hi> was ſo far out of patience to heare ſuch petit companions thus flout and ſcoffe his Maſter (eſpecially the Conſtable, pretending ſo great friendſhip to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and treating with him of ſo many matters) that he thought euery hower ten til he were on horſebacke to aduertiſe the Duke his Maſter thereof. Wherefore he was diſpatched with all ſpeede, and wrote his inſtructions himſelfe: he caried alſo with him a letter of credit, written with the Kings owne hand, and ſo departed.</p>
               <p>The peace with the Engliſh men was already concluded as aboue is mentioned, and all theſe practiſes were abroch in one inſtant. The Kings Commiſſioners had made report of their negotiation as you haue heard, and the King of Englands were
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7649:78"/>
alſo returned to him. Further it was concluded and agreed on both ſides by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors that paſſed betweene them, that the two Princes ſhould meete togither, and after they had ſeene one another and ſworne the treaty, the King of England ſhould returne home into his countrey, hauing firſt receiued the ſum aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of 720000. crownes, and leauing in hoſtage behinde him, till he were paſſed the ſeas, the Lord <hi>Hovvard,</hi> and the Maſter of his horſe called ſir <hi>Iohn Cheinie.</hi> Laſtly, a penſion of 16000. crownes was promiſed to be diuided among the King of Englands principall ſeruants, of the which ſum the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> had two thouſand. The reſt had the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> the Maſter of the horſe, Maſter <hi>Chalanger,</hi> Maſter <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merie,</hi> and others: beſides this, great ſums of money and goodly preſents of ſiluer plate were giuen to King <hi>Edvvards</hi> ſeruants.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Burgundy hearing theſe newes, came in great haſte from Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg where he lay, to the King of England, accompanied onely with ſixteene horſe. The King being much aſtoniſhed at this his ſo ſudden arriuall, asked him what winde draue him thither, perceiuing by his countenance that he was diſpleaſed. The Duke anſwered that he was come to talke with him. The King demanded whether he would ſpeake with him priuately or publikely. Then ſaid the Duke, haue you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded peace? I haue quoth the King made truce for nine yeeres, wherein both you and the Duke of Britaine are comprehended, and I pray you agree thereunto. But the Duke grew maruellous hot, and ſpake in Engliſh (for he could the language) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing what noble acts diuers Kings of England had done in Fraunce, and what great trauell they had ſuſtained to purchaſe honor and renowme. Afterward he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed vehemently againſt this truce, ſaying, that he had not deſired the Engliſh men to paſſe the ſeas for any neede he had of their helpe, but to the end they might recouer their owne right. And to the intent they might perceiue that he ſtood in no need of their comming: he proteſted that he would not make truce with the King, till the King of England had been three moneths at home in his realme: which talke ended, he departed and returned from whence he came. The King of England and his Councell tooke theſe words in euill part: but they that miſliked the peace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended much the Dukes ſpeech.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He King of England to the end the peace might be fully concluded, came and encamped within halfe a league of Amiens. The King was at the gate, from whence he might behold the Engliſh men a far off as they came. To ſay the truth they ſeemed but yong ſoldiers: for they rode in very euill order. The King ſent to the King of England 300.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7649:78"/>
carts laden with the beſt wines that might be gotten: the which carriage ſeemed a far off almoſt as great as the King of Englands armie. Many Engliſh men bicauſe of the truce repaired to the towne, where they behaued themſelues very vndiſcreetly, and without all regard of their Princes honor. They came all in armes, and in great troupes: and if the King our Maſter would haue dealt falſly with them, ſo great a number might neuer ſo eaſily haue beene deſtroied. Notwithſtanding he meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe, but ſtudied to make them good cheere, and to conclude a ſure peace with them for his time. He had cauſed to be ſet at the entrie of the towne gate two long tables, on each ſide of the ſtreet one, furniſhed with all kindes of delicate meats that prouoke drinke, and with the beſt wines that might be gotten, and men to wait vpon them: of water there was no mention. At each of theſe tables he had placed fiue or ſixe great fat gentlemen of good houſes, thereby the better to content thoſe that deſired to drinke. The gentlemens names were theſe: Monſeur de Cran, de Brique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, de Breſmes, de Villiers, and others. So ſoone as the Engliſh men drew neere the gate, they might behold this good cheere. Beſides this, men purpoſely appointed tooke their horſes by the bridles, ſaying that they would breake a ſtaffe with them, and ſo led them to the table, where they were feaſted according to the varietie of the meats: which they tooke in very good part. After they were within the towne, what houſe ſoeuer they entred into they paid nothing. Further, nine or ten tauerns were well furniſhed at the Kings charge of all things neceſſarie: whither they went to eate and drinke, and called for what they would, but the King defraied all: and this cheere endured three or fower daies.</p>
               <p>You haue heard how the Duke of Burgundie miſliked the peace, which howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it diſpleaſed him, troubled the Conſtable much more, bicauſe he ſaw he had fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of his enterpriſe, and purchaſed himſelfe hatred on all ſides: wherefore he ſent his Confeſſor to the King of England with a letter of credit, deſiring him for Gods loue to haue no affiance in the Kings words and promiſes, but to accept the townes of Eu and S. Valerie, and there to lodge himſelfe part of the winter: adding, that within two moneths he would finde meanes to lodge him more commodiouſly. Other aſſurance heerof gaue he him none: for his onely meaning was to feede him foorth with theſe faire words. Laſt of all, to the end he ſhould not conclude a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable treatie for greedines of a little money, he promiſed to lend him fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crownes, with diuers other large offers. But the King had already cauſed the two places aboue mentioned to be burned, bicauſe he knew the King of England had intelligence that the Conſtable had perſwaded him to put them into the Engliſh mens hands. King <hi>Edwards</hi> anſwer was, that the truce was alreadie concluded, and that he would alter nothing therein, but if he had performed his promiſes, he would haue made no ſuch appointment: which anſwer draue the Conſtable into vtter deſpaire.</p>
               <p>You haue heard of the Engliſh mens great cheere in Amiens, but one euening Monſeur de Torcy came to the King and told him, that ſo great a number of them were in the towne, that it ſtood in ſome danger. But the King was diſpleaſed with his meſſage: wherefore euery man forbare to bring him any more ſuch newes. The next morrow was one of the daies that repreſented Childermas day that yeere <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP9.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>, on the which the King vſed not to debate any matter, but accounted it a ſigne of ſome great misfortune towards him, if any man communed with him of his affaires, and would be maruellouſly diſpleaſed with thoſe that were neere about him and acquainted with his humor, if they troubled him with any matter whatſoeuer. Notwithſtanding the ſame morning I now ſpeake of, as he (being but newly riſen) was ſaying his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7649:79"/>
one brought me word that there were at the leaſt nine thouſand Engliſh men within the towne: which newes I hearing, determined to aduertiſe him thereof. Wherefore I entred againe into his cloſet, and ſaid vnto him: Sir, though this day repreſent vnto you Childermas day, yet neceſſity inforceth me to informe you of that I heare. Then I aduertiſed him at large of the great number of Engliſh men that were within the towne, adding that they entred continually all armed, and that no man durſt refuſe them the gate for feare of diſpleaſing them. The King was content to heare me ſpeake, and foorthwith aroſe from his praiers, ſaying, that he would not obſerue the ceremony of Innocents that day, and bad me mount on horſebacke to ſee if I could ſpeake with the Engliſh mens captaines, to cauſe them to depart the towne: further, he commanded me if I met any of his owne captaines, to bid them repaire vnto him, ſaying alſo, that he himſelfe would come to the gate immediately after me. I did as I was commanded, and ſpake to three or fower Engliſh captaines with whom I was acquainted, aduertiſing them what I thought good to be done in this caſe: but for one they put foorth of the towne, twenty came in. The King ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after me the L. of Gié now Marſhall of Fraunce, to take order for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience: we two entred togither into a tauerne, where were ſpent that morning 111. ſhots, yet was it but nine of the clocke. The houſe was full, ſome ſang, ſome ſlept, and ſome were drunke: which when I ſawe, I perceiued no danger to be of ſuch men, and ſent word thereof to the King: who came incontinent with a goodly traine to the gate, and cauſed two or three hundred ſoldiers to arme themſelues ſecretly in their captaines houſes, and placed ſome alſo vpon the gate where the Engliſh men entred. Further, he commanded his diner to be brought into the porters lodge, where he cauſed diuers Engliſh gentlemen to dine with him. The King of England being aduertiſed of this diſorder, was aſhamed thereof, and ſent to the King deſiring him to giue commandement, that no Engliſh man ſhould be ſuffered to enter the towne: whereunto the King anſwered, that he would neuer ſo do: but deſired him if it ſo pleaſed him, to ſend certaine of the yomen of his crowne to keepe the gate, and let in ſuch as they ſhould thinke good: and ſo the King of England did, whereupon a great number of Engliſh men departed the towne by his commandement.</p>
               <p>It was then determined that for perfect concluſion of the peace, Commiſſioners ſhould be appointed on both ſides to aſſigne a place for the enteruiew of the two Kings. For our King, the L. of Bouchage and I my ſelfe were named: and for the King of England, the L. <hi>Howard,</hi> one called <hi>Chalenger,</hi> and a herault. After we had ridden vp and downe and viewed all the riuer, we agreed in the end the pleaſanteſt, ſafeſt, and moſt commodious place to be Picquigny, a towne three leagues from Amiens, with a ſtrong caſtell, belonging to the Vidame of Amiens. Notwithſtanding that it were once burned by the Duke of Burgundy. The towne ſtandeth in a bottom, &amp; the riuer of Som paſſeth through it, which is deeper there than a mans height, but very narrow. The country on both ſides of the riuer through the which the two Kings ſhould paſſe was very open and pleaſant, ſaue that when the King of England drew neere to the riuer ſide, there was a cauſey at the leaſt two bowe ſhot long enuironed with a marſh (a very dangerous paſſage if we had not meant good faith.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without doubt the Engliſhmen (as before I haue ſaid) are not ſo ſubtill and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in theſe treaties and aſſemblies as the French. For (whatſoeuer men ſay of them) they go bluntly to worke, but a man muſt haue patience with them and giue them no croſſe language.</p>
               <p>After the place was aſſigned, we determined to build a ſtrong large bridge ouer the riuer, the worke men and ſtuffe we furniſhed. In the midſt of this bridge a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7649:79"/>
grate was made like to a lions cage, the ſpace betweene each bar being no greater than that a man with eaſe might thruſt in his arme: ouer the head it was boorded to keepe off the raine, ſo brode that ten or twelue might ſtand couered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it on each ſide: ouer the bridge no man could paſſe: for the grate was framed cleane ouerthwart it, and vpon the riuer was but one bote with two men in it, to ferry ouer ſuch as paſſed from the one ſide to the other.</p>
               <p>I will tell you what mooued the King to make this grate in ſuch ſort that no man could paſſe through it, bicauſe it may peraduenture ſtand ſome man in ſtead that ſhall haue occaſion to make the like. In King <hi>Charles</hi> the 7. youth, this realme was greeuouſly plagued by the Engliſh men. For King <hi>Henry</hi> the 5. held the ſiege before Roan, and had brought the towne to great extremity: the moſt part of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants being either ſubiects to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Burgundy then liuing, or of his faction.</p>
               <p>Betweene the ſaid Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> of Burgundy and the Duke of Orleans great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had beene of long time, ſo far foorth, that the whole realme or the greateſt part was rent into two factions, whereby the Kings eſtate was much weakened: for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality neuer ariſeth in any realme, but in the end the fire thereof is dangerous and hard to be quenched. This variance grew ſo hot, that the Duke of Orleans was ſlaine at Paris about eleuen yeeres before <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP9.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>. The Duke of Burgundy led a great army, with the which he marched towards Normandy, minding to leuy the ſiege before Roan <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP9.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>, but to the end he might be the ſtronger, and the better aſſured of the King, it was agreed that the King and he ſhould meet at Montereau faut Yonne, where a bridge was made and a grate ouerthwart it, with a little wicket in the middeſt boulted on both ſides, ſo that a man might paſſe through with conſent of both parties. The King <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP9.NOTE4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> came on the one ſide of the bridge, and the Duke on the other: being both accompanied with a great number of men of armes, eſpecially the Duke. They fell in communication togither vpon the bridge: at the which were preſent on the Dukes ſide onely three or fower <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP9.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref>. But after they had talked a while, the Duke either through earneſt ſollicitation of thoſe that were with the King, or of a deſire he had to humble himſelfe before him, vnboulted the wicket on his ſide, and the others on theirs. Three of the Dukes men went through before him, and then himſelfe paſſed being the fourth and was immediately ſlaine <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP9.NOTE6">

                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>. The K. had with him about eight hundred men of armes, and arriued firſt at the grate: on the King of Englands ſide ſtood all his armie in order of battell, which vndoubtedly was great both of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and footemen: yet could not we diſcouer his whole force. We on our ſide ſeemed but a handfull to them, and no maruell: for the fourth part of the Kings armie was not there. It was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that each of the Kings ſhould be accompanied at the grate with twelue perſons, which were alreadie named, of the nobleſt perſonages and ſuch as were nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt about them. Moreouer, on our ſide were fower of the King of Englands ſeruants to view what we did, and as many of ours on their ſide. The King as I told you, arriued firſt at the grate, and twelue of vs waited vpon him, among whom were the late Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> of Bourbon and the Cardinall his brother. It pleaſed him that I ſhould weare that day a ſute of apparell like his owne: for he had vſed of long time, and that verie often, to command one or other to be apparelled like himſelfe. The King of England came along vpon the cauſey aboue mentioned with a maruellous goodly traine, as was conuenient for the maieſtie of a Prince: he was accompanied with the Duke of Clarence his brother, the Earle of Northumberland, and diuers other noble men, namely the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> his Chamberlaine, his Chauncellor, and others. But there were not paſt three or fower beſides himſelfe apparelled in cloth of golde. Further, he ware on his head a black veluet cap with a maruellous rich iewell, being a Flower
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7649:80"/>
de luce ſet with ſtones. He was a goodly tall Prince, but inclined now to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what groſſe, &amp; I had ſeene him before much beautifuller than at this preſent: for ſure when the Earle of Warwicke chaſed him out of England, he was the goodlieſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that euer I ſet mine eie on. When he came within fiue foote of the grate, he tooke off his cap, and bowed downe within halfe a foote of the ground: the King in like maner who was leaning vpon the grate, vſed great reuerence towards him: &amp; when they came to embrace each other through the grate, the King of England againe made low obeiſance. Then the King began the talke and ſaid: Coſin, you are moſt hartily welcom, there is no man in the world whom I haue ſo much deſired to ſee as you, and praiſed be God that we are met heere to ſo good a purpoſe: heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the King of England anſwered in good French. This talke ended, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of England, who was a Prelate and Biſhop of Elie, began his oration with a propheſie (whereof the Engliſh men are neuer vnfurniſhed <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP10.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>:) which ſaid that in this place of Picquigny an honorable peace ſhould be concluded betweene the realmes of Fraunce and England. The Biſhops oration being ended, the letters were opened that the King had deliuered to the King of England touching the concluſion of the treatie: and the ſaid Chancellor asked the King whether they were written by his commandement, and whether he auowed them: whereunto the King anſwered yea. Then the Biſhop asked him againe, if he held himſelfe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in like maner with thoſe letters and writings that were deliuered him on the King of Englands behalfe: whereunto the King anſwered as before. Then was the miſſall brought foorth and opened: vpon the which each of the Kings laide one of their hands, and the other vpon the true holie croſſe, and ſware both of them to keepe and obſerue the articles concluded betweene them, namely the truce for nine yeeres, wherein the confederats of both parties were comprehended, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of their children to be accompliſhed in maner and forme as was comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the treatie. After they had both ſworne, the King (who had his words at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement) began to enter into pleaſant talke with the K. of England: ſaying that he ſhould come to Paris to ſolace himſelfe there with the Ladies, and that he would giue him the Cardinall of Bourbon for his confeſſor, who would eaſilie aſſoile him of that ſinne, if any were committed. The King of England tooke great pleaſure in this talke, and anſwered with a merry countenanee: for he knew the Cardinall to be a good fellow. After ſome ſuch like ſpeeches paſſed betweene them, the King to ſhew that he had authority among his men, commanded thoſe that were with him to withdraw themſelues, ſaying that he would commune with the King of England in ſecret: which they that accompanied the King of England ſeeing, retired without commandement. After the two Kings had communed awhile togither, the King called me to him, and asked the King of England if he knew me, who anſwered, that he knew me well, and named the places where he had ſeene me, adding, that in times paſt I had taken paines to do him ſeruice in Calais during the time I was with the Duke of Burgundy. Then the King inquired of him, if the Duke of Burgundy would not be comprehended in the truce (as it was to be preſumed bicauſe of his froward anſwer, that he would not) what it would pleaſe him that he ſhould do? The King of England ſaid, that he would offer it him yet once more, and if he refuſed to accept it, that then they two ſhould do as they thought good. Afterward the King fell in talke of the Duke of Britaine (which was the onely end why he mooued this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) &amp; asked him in like maner of him. The King of England deſired him earneſtly to attempt nothing againſt the D. of Britain, ſaying that in his neceſſity he neuer found ſo faithfull a friend: whereupon the King ended this communication: and then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7649:81"/>
the company togither againe, with the moſt curteous and gratious language that might be, tooke his leaue of the King of England, giuing very good words in like maner to euery one of his ſeruants. And ſo the two Princes in a maner both at one inſtant departed from the grate and tooke horſe. The King returned to Amiens, and the King of England to his campe, whither we ſent from the court all kinde of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion neceſſary for him, ſo far foorth, that torches and lights were not forgotten. At this enteruiewe the Duke of Gloceſter King Edwards brother, and certaine others were not preſent, bicauſe they miſliked the peace. Notwithſtanding, afterward they were well ynough perſwaded to allow of it, ſo far foorth that the ſaid Duke of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter came to Amiens to the King, who gaue him many goodly preſents of ſiluer plate, and horſes with all kinde of furniture.</p>
               <p>After the King was returned from this meeting, vpon the way he debated two points with me: the one, he found the King of England ſo willing to come to Paris that it liked him neuer a whit. For he is, quoth he, a goodly Prince, and much giuen to loue: he may peraduenture meete with ſome dainty dame at Paris, that will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him with ſo many ſugred words, that ſhe may happily make him deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thither againe. But his predeceſſors haue ſoiourned too long both at Paris and in Normandy. I like not his company on this ſide the ſea, but ſo long as he keepeth home, I wiſh to haue him my good friend and louing brother. The other point was this, he was ſory that he found the King of England ſomwhat hard when he made mention of the D. of Britaine: for the King was ſo deſirous to perſwade him to ſuffer war to be made in Britaine, that afterward he ſollicited this matter anew by the Lords of Bouchage and Saint Pierre. But the King of England ſeeing himſelfe thus earneſtly preſſed, anſwered in fewe words, that who ſo ſhould make war vpon the Duke of Britaine, he would paſſe the ſeas yet once againe in his defence: which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer being heard, the matter was no further mentioned. After the K. was returned to Amiens, euen as he was going to ſupper, arriued three or fower noble men of England ſuch as had furthered the peace, and the Lord <hi>Hovvard</hi> (who was one of them) began to talke with the King in his eare, ſaying, that if it pleaſed him, he would finde meanes to bring his Maſter to Amiens, and peraduenture to Paris, to make merry with him, which offer though the King liked neuer a whit, yet made he ſhew of great good liking thereof, and began to waſh, not anſwering much to that point, but tolde me ſoftly in mine eare, that the thing he moſt feared was hapned, meaning this offer. After ſupper they fell againe in communication of the ſelfeſame matter, but with wiſe words the enterpriſe was broken off: for the King ſaid, that with all ſpeede he muſt depart to go againſt the Duke of Burgundy. Although theſe affaires were of great importance and ſagely ordered on both ſides: yet you ſee merry toies hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo among them which are not to be forgotten. But as touching the K. who will maruell (conſidering the great harmes the Engliſh men haue done in Fraunce but of late yeeres) if he trauelled his body, and ſpent his money to rid them friendly out of the realme, to the intent heereafter he might keepe them his friends, at the leaſt not haue them his foes.</p>
               <p>The next day after this meeting, a great number of Engliſh men repaired to Amiens, ſome of them affirming that the holy Ghoſt had made this peace (for they grounded all on propheſies.) The reaſon that mooued them ſo to ſay was, for that a white pigeon ſate vpon the King of Englands pauilion the day of the enteruiew, and would not remooue thence notwithſtanding any noiſe made in the camp. The cauſe whereof as ſome men iudged, was, for that it had rained a little, and afterward the ſunne ſhining very hot, the pigeon lighted vpon this pauilion (being higher than
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7649:81"/>
the reſt) to drie hir ſelfe: which reaſon was giuen by a gentleman of Gaſcoine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to the King of England, named <hi>Lewis</hi> of Bretailles, who was not a little offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the peace. And bicauſe he and I were of old acquaintance, he talked fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with me: ſaying that we would deride the King of England for this treatie. I asked him how many battels the ſaid King had woon: he told me nine, in the which himſelfe had beene in perſon. Then I demanded of him againe, how many he had loſt: and he anſwered neuer but one, which was this we now bereaued him of: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he receiued greater diſhonor by returning home after this ſort, than he had obtained honor in winning the other nine. Of this communication I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed the King, who ſaid he was a dangerous knaue, and that ſome meanes muſt be found to ſtop his mouth: whereupon he ſent for him, and made him dine at his owne table, offering him verie large offers and goodly offices if he would tarry in Fraunce. But ſeeing he would by no meanes be woon thereunto, he gaue him a thouſand crownes in money, promiſing alſo a good turne to his brethren that were on this ſide the ſea, and I gaue him a watchword in his eare, to employ his credit to continue the friendſhip and amity begun betweene the two Princes.</p>
               <p>The King feared eſpecially aboue all things leaſt ſome word ſhould eſcape him at vnawares, whereby the Engliſh men might gather that he derided them. And by chaunce the next morning after this meeting, as he was in his cloſet, and not paſt three or fower of vs with him, he ſpake a merrie word touching the wines and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ſent to the Engliſh campe: and as he turned about eſpied a merchant of Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coine that dwelt in England, who was come to mooue a ſute to him for a licence to ſhip certaine Gaſcoine wines into England without impoſt, which was a ſute that might much benefit the ſaid merchant if he could obtaine it. The King woondered when he ſaw him how he was gotten in thither, and asked him of what towne he was in Guienne, and whether he were a merchant and married in England. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant anſwered yea, but that his wealth was not great. Incontinent before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thence, the K. appointed one to accompanie him to Bordeaux, and I communed with him by his commandement. Further, a good office in the towne where he was borne was giuen him: the licence for the wines which he demanded was granted him, and beſides this 1000. franks were deliuered him for his wiues charges vpon the way, and he ſent a brother of his into England for hir, but went not himſelfe. Thus the King condemned himſelfe in this penaltie for his ouer large ſpeech.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7649:82"/>
Monſeur <hi>de Contay</hi> was already returned from the Duke of Burgundie to the Court, about the practiſe aboue mentioned deuiſed againſt the Conſtable: ſo that the ſaid Conſtable knew not to what Saint he ſhould vow himſelf, but remained in vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire. <hi>Rapines</hi> meſſage was very humble, tending to excuſe his Maſter of the ſundry euill reports that he knew had been made of him to the King, for that the end ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared, that he neuer meant to do otherwiſe than dutie required. And to the intent he might the better aſſure the King of his true dealing, he promiſed ſo to practiſe with the Duke of Burgundy, that he would perſwade him to helpe to deſtroy the King of England and his whole army, if it ſo pleaſed the King. And it ſeemed by his ſpeech that his Maſter was in vtter deſpaire. We told him that we were in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect amity with the Engliſh men, and would no war. But Monſeur <hi>de Lude</hi> who was with me, aduentured to aske him if he knew where his Maſters treaſure lay. I maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to heare ſuch a word paſſe him: for ſeeing this <hi>Rapine</hi> was a very truſtie ſeruant to his Maſter, this ſpeech was ſufficient to haue cauſed the Conſtable to flie, and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in what eſtate he was, and what was a brewing for him, eſpecially ſeeing the danger he had been in not paſt a yeere before. But I neuer knew man in my life nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heere nor elſewhere, that could diſlodge in time and ſhun the danger hanging ouer his head: ſome bicauſe they thinke they ſhall not be receiued nor be in ſafetie in ſtrange countries, and other ſome bicauſe they are too much affectionate to their goods, wiues and children: which two reaſons haue been the cauſe of many a good mans vndooing.</p>
               <p>After we had made report to the King of <hi>Rapines</hi> meſſage, he called for one of his Secretaries, none being with him but the Lord <hi>Hovvard</hi> the King of Englands ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, (who vnderſtood nothing of this practiſe againſt the Conſtable,) the Lord of Contay who was returned from the Duke of Burgundy, and we two that had talked with the ſaid <hi>Rapine.</hi> Then he indited a letter to the Conſtable, wherein he aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed him of all that was done the day before, namely, the treaty of peace.

This letter was deliuered to <hi>Rapine,</hi> who liked it maruellous well, eſpecially thoſe words that the King had need of ſuch a head as his Maſters, but he vnderſtood not the myſtery thereof. The King of England alſo ſent the King the two letters of credit that the Conſtable had written to him, and diſcloſed all the meſſages that he had ſent him, whereby you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how the Conſtable had behaued himſelfe towards theſe three great Princes, and in what eſtate he was: euery one of the three deſiring his death.</p>
               <p>The King of England vpon the receit of his money departed, and marched in great haſte towards Callice, fearing the D. of Burgundies malice &amp; his ſubiects, and not without cauſe: for whenſoeuer his men ſcattered &amp; ſingled themſelues, ſome of them came ſhort home. At his departure he left for hoſtages with the King, till his returne into England according to his promiſe, the Lord <hi>Hovvard,</hi> and the Maſter of his horſe called Sir <hi>Iohn Cheiny.</hi>

               <p>You haue heard before at the entrance into theſe Engliſh affaires, that K. <hi>Edward</hi> had no great deuotion to this voyage into Fraunce: for being come to Douer, before he embarked he began to practiſe with vs. But there were two cauſes that mooued him to paſſe the ſeas: one, the deſire his whole realme had according, to their natural humor, to make war in Fraunce, and the rather at this preſent, bicauſe the Duke of Burgundy preſſed the war ſo earneſtly: the other, the hope he had to reſerue to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7649:82"/>
himſelfe a great part of the ſubſidie leuied in England for this voiage: for as before I haue ſaid, the Kings of England receiue onely the bare reuenues of their lands, ſaue when they leuie money to make war in Fraunce. Further, K. <hi>Edward</hi> had deuiſed this ſubtiltie to appeaſe his ſubiects: he had brought with him ten or 12. great fat paun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as well of the citie of London, as of other townes in England, who were the wealthieſtmen of the commonaltie, and had been the chiefeſt inſtruments both in perſwading the King to paſſe into Fraunce, and alſo in leuying this mightie army. The King cauſed them to be lodged in good tents, but that was not the life they were accuſtomed to lead: wherefore they ſoone waxed wearie of it. At their firſt arriuall they looked for the battell within three daies after their landing. But the King of England alleaged many doubts vnto them, and endeuored to put them in feare of the battell, and to perſwade them to allow of the peace, to the ende they might aide him at their returne into England to pacifie the murmuring and grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the people that happily might ariſe bicauſe of his returne: for neuer King of England ſince King <hi>Arthur,</hi> paſſed at one time with ſo great force, and ſo many noble perſonages into Fraunce. But after the peace was concluded, the King of England repaired homeward with ſpeed, reſeruing to himſelfe a great ſumme of monie leuied in England for the paiment of his ſoldiers; ſo that he obtained in effect all his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. His bodie could not away with ſuch labor as a King of England muſt endure that mindeth to atchieue any great enterpriſe in Fraunce. Further, the King our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had made great preparation for reſiſtance, though to ſay the truth he could not well haue prouided defence ſufficient againſt all his enimies: for he had too manie. Laſtly, the King of England had a maruellous great deſire to accompliſh the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his daughter with King <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. now raigning, which cauſed him to winke at a number of inconueniences, that turned after to the King our Maſters great profit.</p>

The King was very deſirous at this time to conclude a finall peace: for this mightie Engliſh armie had put him in feare, and no maruell: for he had ſeene in his time of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this realme, and would in no wiſe their returne. The ſaid Chauncellor writ to the King, deſiring that it would pleaſe him to ſend his Commiſſioners for the peace to a certaine bridge in the midway betweene Auennes and Veruins, ſaying, that he and his colleagues would meet them there. The King ſent him anſwer, that he would come thither himſelfe; and notwithſtanding that diuers, whoſe aduiſe he asked in this matter, perſwaded him to the contrarie: yet thither he went, leading alſo with him the Engliſh hoſtages, who were preſent when he receiued the Dukes ambaſſadors, the which came very well accompanied with archers and men of war. At this firſt meeting they did but ſalute the King, &amp; then went to dinner.

true, that told vs you would deride vs for making peace. Call you the money the King giueth vs, a penſion? it is tribute, and by Saint George you may babble ſo much that you may ſoone make vs to returne. But I brake off their talke and turned it to a ieſt: notwithſtanding the Engliſhman was diſcontented and caſt out a word thereof to the King, who was maruellouſly offended with the Lord of Narbonne for his ſpeech.</p>
               <p>The King communed not long at this firſt meeting with the Chancellor and the other ambaſſadors: for it was agreed that they ſhould go with him to Veruines, where when they arriued he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded M. <hi>Tanneguy du Chaſtell,</hi> and M. <hi>Peter Doriole</hi> Chancellor of Fraunce, and others to negotiate with them: much ado there was betweene them, many reaſons alleaged, and many demands made on each ſide. The Kings Commiſſioners made report to him that the Burgundians vſed fierce and ſtout language, but that they had paid them with the like, and withall tolde him what their anſwers were. Which he much miſliked, ſaying, that the like anſwers had been made diuers times before, and that they treated not of a finall peace, but onely of truce; wherefore he would haue no more ſuch language vſed, but would himſelfe commune with them: and thereupon cauſed the ſaid Chauncellor and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Admirall called the baſtard of Burbon, Monſeur de Bouchage, and my ſelfe. There the King concluded truce for nine yeeres, wherein it was agreed, that euery man ſhuld be reſtored to his former eſtate. But the ambaſſadors beſought the King that the truce might not yet be proclaimed, to ſaue the D. their Maſters oth, who had ſworne not to make truce before the King of England had been a certaine ſpace in his realme, leaſt he ſhould thinke their Maſter had accepted his truce.</p>
               <p>But the King of England (who thought great ſcorne that the Duke would not be comprehended in his truce) being aduertiſed that he treated with the King of an other, ſent ouer into Fraunce a knight neere about him called Sir <hi>Thomas Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery,</hi> who came to Veruins at the very ſame inſtant that the King treated with the Duke of Burgundies ambaſſadors of this truce aboue mentioned. The ſaid Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> required the King in the King his Maſters name, to make no other truce with the Duke of Burgundy, than that which was already concluded betweene them two. Further deſiring him not to deliuer Saint Quintins into the Dukes hands, &amp; offering that if he would continue war with the Duke, his Maſter would be content the next ſommer to paſſe the ſeas againe for him, and in his aide, with theſe conditions. Firſt, that the King ſhould recompence the loſſe the King of England ſhould ſuſtaine by the wooll cuſtome of Calice, amounting yeerely to 50000. crownes: which if the war opened with Flaunders were cleerely loſt. And ſecondarily, that the King ſhould pay the one halfe of the Engliſh army, and the King of England the other. The King yeelded great thanks to the King of England for this curteous meſſage, and gaue a goodly preſent of ſiluer plate to the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas.</hi> Notwithſtanſting, as touching the war he excuſed himſelfe, ſaying, that the truce was already concluded, being the very ſame that the King of England and he had made for the terme of nine yeeres, ſaue that the Duke would haue his letters apart. Thus to content the ambaſſador he excuſed the matter the beſt he could, and the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> returned into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the hoſtages with him. The King maruelled much at the King of Englands offers, at the report whereof I onely was preſent. But it ſeemed to him a dangerous thing, to cauſe the King of England to paſſe the ſeas againe, both bicauſe euery trifle would breede quarrels betweene the French and Engliſh being in campe togither; and alſo bicauſe it was to be feared that the Burgundians and they would eaſily

In the ſaid writings the King promiſed the Duke Saint Quintins, Han, Bohain, and all the lands that the Conſtable held of the Duke, and all his moouables whereſoeuer they were found <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP12.NOTE1">

                  </ref>. Further, the maner how to beſiege him in Han (where he lay) was deuiſed. It was alſo agreed that whether of the two Princes could firſt take him, ſhould either put him to death within eight daies, or deliuer him to the other. All men incontinent began to feare this confederacie, ſo far foorth that the Conſtables principall ſeruants forſooke him, namely Monſeur <hi>de Genly</hi> and diuers others. Further, he being aduertiſed that King <hi>Edward</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered his letters to the King and diſcouered all that he knew of him; and ſeeing alſo that his enimies had made truce, fell into great feare, and ſent to the Duke of Burgundie, humbly beſeeching him to giue him a ſafe conduct to come and ſpeake with him about certaine affaires that greatly imported him. The Duke at the firſt made dainty to grant a ſafe conduct, but in the end ſent him one. This mighty noble man had oft debated, whither he ſhould flie to ſaue himſelfe: for he was informed of all that was done, and had ſeene the writings deuiſed againſt him at Bouuines. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he conſulted with certaine of his ſeruants, being Lorrains, determining to flie with them into Almain, carying a great ſum of money with him (for the way was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſafe) therewith to buy ſom place vpon the riuer of Rhene to remaine in, till he were reconciled to one of the two Princes. Somtime he reſolued to put himſelfe into his ſtrong caſtel of Han, which had coſt him ſo much money, and which he had fortified to ſerue him at ſuch a pinch, and furniſhed of al things as well as any caſtell that euer I knew. But he could not finde men to his minde to put into the place, bicauſe all his ſeruants were borne vnder the Dominions of one of the two Princes. And peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his feare was ſo great, that he durſt not wholy diſcouer himſelfe and his eſtate to them; for I thinke a great many of them would not haue forſaken him: neither was it ſo dangerous for him to be beſieged of both the Princes as of one, for it had been
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7649:84"/>
impoſſible for the two armies to agree.</p>
               <p>But in the end he concluded to go to the Duke of Burgundy vnder this ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, being accompanied onely with fifteene or twenty horſe, and rode to Montz in Hainault, where the Lord <hi>Deſmeriez</hi> great bailife of Hainault and his eſpecial friend lay. With him he ſoiourned a certaine ſpace, attending newes from the Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, who had lately begun war vpon the Duke of Lorraine, bicauſe he had defied him when he lay at the ſiege before Nuz, and done much harme in the countrey of Luxembourg.</p>
               <p>The King being aduertiſed of the Conſtables departure, purpoſed ſo to order the matter, that he ſhould neuer recouer the Duke of Burgundies fauor: for he leuied ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or eight hundred men of armes, and rode with them in all haſte to Saint Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, knowing well what force was within the towne; neere to the which when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched, certaine of the Citizens came foorth to receiue him. The King comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to enter the towne, and appoint euery captaine to his quarter, and ſo I did. Firſt the ſoldiers entred, and then the King, who was very honorably receiued of the townes men: whereupon certaine of the Conſtables ſeruants retired into Hainault. The King immediately aduertiſed the Duke by a letter of his own hand, of the taking of Saint Quintins; thereby to put him vtterly out of hope to recouer it by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables meanes. Which newes when the Duke vnderſtood, he ſent word to the Lord <hi>Deſmeriez</hi> great bailife of Hainault, to garde the towne of Montz in ſuch ſort, that the Conſtable could not depart, and farther to commaund him to keepe his lodging: which commandement the bailife executed accordingly, for he durſt do no leſſe. Notwithſtanding, the garde was not ſtrong enough for ſuch a perſonage, if he had been diſpoſed to eſcape. What ſhall we ſay heere of Fortune? This noble man dwelt vpon the frontiers of both theſe Princes dominions being enimies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſtrong townes in his hands, and fower hundred men of armes well paied, of the which he was Comptroller himſelfe, and placed whom it pleaſed him, and had been their Captain the ſpace of twelue yeeres. He was a wiſe and a valiant knight, and of great experience, and had great treaſure in ready coine: yet notwithſtanding at this laſt pinch his courage ſo failed him, that he wiſt not what ſhift to make. We may well ſay, that fickle Fortune behelde him with a frowning countenance: or rather (if we will ſpeake like good Chriſtians) we muſt ſay, that ſuch great miſeries depend not vpon Fortune: for Fortune is bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> phantaſticall fiction of Poetrie. Wherefore we muſt thinke if we will well weigh both the reaſons aboue alleaged, and diuers others heere vnrehearſed, that God had vtterly forſaken him and giuen him ouer. And if it were lawfull for man to iudge, as I know it is not (eſpecially for me) I would ſay that in mine opinion all this miſery fell vpon him, bicauſe he trauelled continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the vttermoſt of his power to nouriſh the war betweene the King and the Duke of Burgundy, knowing his great authority and eſtate to depend therupon: although to ſay the truth, the matter needed no great labor, for there was a naturall antipathy between them. Who is ſo rude or ignorant to thinke that Fortune or any other like chance was able to caſt ſo wiſe a man into the diſgrace of both theſe Princes at once, (who in their liues neuer agreed in any thing ſaue onely this,) eſpecially into the King of Englands diſgrace, who had maried his neece, and loued entirely all his wiues kinſmen, eſpecially thoſe of this houſe of Saint Paul. It is like therefore, yea it is moſt certaine, that God had withdrawne his grace from him, in that he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed himſelfe ſuch hatred of all theſe three Princes, and had not one friend in the world that durſt giue him a nights lodging. Neither was it fained Fortune that ſtrake this ſtroke, but God alone. The like whereof hath hapned, and ſhall happen to diuers
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7649:84"/>
others, who after great and long proſperity fall into great aduerſity and trouble. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conſtable was arreſted in Hainault by the Duke of Burgundies commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the King ſent word to the Duke either to deliuer him into his hands, or execute him according to the tenure of the writings aboue mentioned. The Duke anſwered that he would ſo do, and commanded the Conſtable to be led to Peronne, and there ſtraightly kept. Further you ſhall vnderſtand that the Duke had already taken diuers places in Lorraine and Barrois, and at this preſent helde the ſiege before Nancy, which was valiantly defended. The King had great force of men of armes in Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne, which held the Duke in feare: for the King was not bound by the truce to ſuffer him to deſtroy the Duke of Lorraine, who was retired into Fraunce. The Lord of Bouchage and diuers other ambaſſadors ſent by the King, preſſed the Duke ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, to performe his promiſe &amp; oth; and he anſwered euer that he would ſo do; but yet delaid it more than a moneth ouer and aboue the eight daies wherin he ſhould either haue deliuered the Conſtable, or put him to death. Notwithſtanding in the end ſeeing the matter ſo earneſtly preſſed, and fearing that the King would hinder his enterpriſe in Lorraine, which he ſo much deſired to atchieue, to the end he might haue the paſſage open from Luxembourg into Burgundy, and ioine all theſe Senio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries togither: for this little Duchy of Lorraine being his, he might come vpon his owne dominions from Holland, almoſt as far as Lions <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP12.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>. For theſe conſiderations I ſay, he wrote to his Chancellor and the Lord of Himbercourt ſo often already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, (which two had abſolute authority in his abſence, and were both of them the Conſtables enimies, and euill willers) to go to Peronne and deliuer the Conſtable at a day by him prefixed, to thoſe that the King ſhould there appoint to receiue him, ſending word withall to the Lord <hi>Deſmeriez</hi> to deliuer him to the ſaid Chancellor and <hi>Himbercourt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of Burgundy in the meane time beat continually the towne of Nancy: but there were good ſoldiers within it which valiantly defended it. Further, one of the Dukes owne Captaines, called the Earle of Campobache, a Neapolitane born, but baniſhed thence for the houſe of Anious faction, was lately entred into intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the Duke of Lorraine, heire apparant of the houſe of Aniou after the death of King <hi>Rene</hi> his mothers father. This Earle of Campobache promiſed to prolong the ſiege, and finde meanes that ſuch things ſhould be lacking as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the taking of the towne <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP12.NOTE3">

                  </ref>. Which his promiſe, he was very well able to performe, being then the greateſt man in the Dukes army; but a falſe traitor to his Maſter, as heerafter you ſhall heare more at large. This was a preparatiue as it were of all thoſe euils and miſeries that fell afterward vpon the Duke of Burgundy. The ſaid Duke meant as I ſuppoſe, if he had taken the towne before the day appointed for the Conſtables deliuery, not to deliuer him at all. And on the otherſide I thinke, if the King had had him, he would haue done more in the Duke of Lorraines fauor than he did: for he was aduertiſed of the Earle of Campobaches traiterous practiſes, but medled not with them: yet was he not bound to let the Duke of Burgundy do what him liſted in Lorraine, (notwithſtanding for diuers reſpects he thought it beſt ſo to do:) beſides this he had great forces vpon the frontiers of the ſaid countrey of Lorraine.</p>

But me thinke that he being ſo great a Prince and of ſo noble and honorable an houſe, ſhould not haue giuen him a ſafe conduct, and then arreſt him. And vndoubtedly it was great crueltie to deliuer him where he was ſure to die, eſpecially for couetouſnes. But ſoone after he had thus diſhonored himſelfe by this deede, he receiued great loſſes and began to fall to ruine. So that if we well conſider the workes that God hath done in theſe our daies, and daily doth, we ſhal eaſily perceiue that he will leaue no fault vnpuniſhed, and that theſe ſtrange puniſhments are inflicted onely by him, bicauſe they ſurmount far the works of nature. For his puniſhments are ſudden, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vpon thoſe that vſe violence and cruelty: who can not be meane perſons, but mighty men, either in ſeniories or authority. This houſe of Burgundy had long
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7649:85"/>
floriſhed, for by the ſpace of a hundred yeeres or thereabout, (during the which time raigned fower of this houſe) it was more eſteemed than any other houſe in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For all thoſe that were mightier then it, had ſuffered great afflictions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, but it liued continually in perpetual felicity &amp; honor. The firſt great Prince of this houſe was <hi>Philip</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Hardy,</hi> brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the fift King of Fraunce, who maried the daughter and heire of the Earle of Flaunders; being Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe not onely of that countrey, but alſo of Artois, Burgundy <ref target="#S5602.BK4.CHAP13.NOTE1">

The ſecond was <hi>Iohn:</hi> the third was the good Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> who ioined to his houſe the Duchies of Brabant, Luxembourg, Lambourg, and the Counties of Holland, Zeland, Hainault, and Namur. The fourth was this Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> who after his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death was one of the richeſt and moſt redoubted Princes of Chriſtendome; and had in moueables, namely iewels, plate, tapeſtry, bookes, and naprie, more than three of the greateſt Princes in Chriſtendome. Of treaſure in coine I haue ſeene greater abundance in other Princes Courts: for Duke <hi>Philip</hi> by the ſpace of many yeeres leuied neither ſubſidies nor taskes: yet notwithſtanding at his death, he left his ſonne aboue three hundred thouſand crowns in ready money, and in peace with all his neighbors, which long indured not: notwithſtanding I will not impute the whole occaſion of the wars to him, for others were as buſie as he. His ſubiects im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after his fathers death, vpon a ſmall requeſt graunted him very willingly a ſubſidie (euerie countrey apart) for the terme of ten yeeres, amounting yeerly to the ſumme of 350000. crownes: Burgundy not being comprehended therein. Yea and at the time he deliuered the Conſtable, he leuied yeerely ouer and aboue the former ſumme more then 300000. crownes, and had aboue 300000. crownes in coine; and all the Conſtables goods that came to his hands, amounted hardly to the value of 80000. crownes, for he had but 76000. in coine. So that the Duke commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this foule fault for ſmall gaine, yet was the puniſhment thereof great: for God raiſed vp an enimie againſt him of ſmall force, of yoong yeeres, and of little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all things, and cauſed his ſeruant whom he then moſt truſted, to become falſe and traiterous. He made alſo the Duke himſelfe to miſtruſt his owne ſubiects &amp; faithfull ſeruants. Are not theſe ſuch manifeſt tokens and preparatiues as God vſed in the old Teſtament, againſt thoſe whoſe good fortune and proſperitie he meant to chang into miſery and aduerſitie? Yet he neuer humbled himſelfe before God, but euen till the hower of death attributed all his good ſucceſſe to his owne wiſedome and proweſſe: before his death he was mightier than any of his predeceſſors, and more eſteemed through the whole world.</p>
               <p>Before the Conſtables deliuerie he was fallen into a maruellous miſtruſt or great diſdaine of his owne ſubiects: for he had ſent into Italie for a thouſand men of armes Italians. Before Nuz alſo he had great forces of Italians in his campe: for the Earle of Campobache had vnder his charge fower hundred men of armes and better. This Earle had no poſſeſſions for his maintenance, for bicauſe of the wars the houſe of Aniou had made in the realme of Naples (which houſe he ſerued,) he was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his countrey and loſt all his landes, and ſerued euer ſince his departure out of Italie in Prouence or Lorraine vnder King <hi>Rene</hi> of Sicile, or Duke <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſonne to Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> of Calabria. After whoſe death the Duke of Burgundie gaue entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to moſt of his ſeruants, eſpecially all his Italians: namely this Earle of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pobache, <hi>Iames Galeot</hi> a valiant honorable and faithfull gentleman, and diuers others. The ſaid Earle of Campobache when he went into Italie to leuie his men, receiued of the Duke of Burgundie 40000. duckets in preſt for his companie. But as he paſſed through Lions, he fell in acquaintance with a Phiſition named Maſter
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7649:86"/>
                  <hi>Simon</hi> of Pauy, by whom he aduertiſed the King that if he would grant him certaine demands, he would promiſe him at his returne to deliuer the Duke of Burgundy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands: the like offer made he alſo to Monſeur de Saint Pray, then ambaſſador in Premont for the King. Againe, at his returne hauing his men of armes lying in the County of Marle, he offered the King that ſo ſoone as he ſhould be in campe with his Maſter, he would not faile either to kill him, or take him priſoner; ſhewing withall the maner how he would do it, which was this. The Duke rode often about his campe to viewe it, mounted vpon a little nagge, and very ſlenderly accompanied, at ſome ſuch time this Earle ſaid he would aſſault him, and execute his enterpriſe. He made yet alſo another offer to the King, namely, if the King and the Duke met togither in battell, to turne with his men of armes on the Kings ſide, vnder condition that the King would grant him certaine demands. The King deteſted much the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this man, and of a noble courage aduertiſed the Duke of his practiſes by the Lord of Contay aboue mentioned. Notwithſtanding the Duke would not credit the meſſage, (ſuppoſing that the King ſent him this aduertiſement to ſome other end) but loued the Earle all the better. Wherefore you may ſee how God had trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his wits, in that he would giue no credit to thoſe manifeſt demonſtrations the King ſhewed him. Well, this Earle of Campobache was not ſo falſe and traiterous: but <hi>Iames Galeot</hi> was as true and truſty, who liued many yeers, and died with great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and renowme.</p>

               <head>How the Duke of Burgundie making war vpon the Swiſſers, was ouerthrowen at the ſtraights of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines neere to Granſon. Chap. 1.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Duke of Burgundie hauing conquered the Duchie of Lorraine, and receiued Saint Quintins, Han and Bohain, with all the Conſtables goods of the King, treated with him of a finall peace: for accompliſhment whereof they two reſolued to meete vpon a bridge built ouer a riuer, like to that made at Piquigny, at the enteruiew of the Kings of England and Fraunce. About the which mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting meſſengers paſſed to and fro, ſo far foorth that the Duke was once purpoſed to diſmiſſe the greateſt part of his armie, to the end his men (being in very euill order, as well bicauſe of the ſiege of Nuz, as alſo of this ſmall war in Lorraine) might refreſh themſelues: and the reſt to put in garriſon into certaine of the Earle of Romonts places, neere to the townes of Berne and Fribourg; vpon the which he was fully reſolued to make war, bicauſe they had inuaded his dominions while he was before Nuz, had holpen to take the countie of Ferrette from him (as you haue heard) and had alſo conquered from the Earle of Romont part of his countrie. The King earneſtly preſſed him to come to the meeting appointed, to leaue theſe poore Swiſſers in peace, and to refreſh his armie. The Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers alſo ſeeing him approch ſo neere them, ſent their ambaſſadors to him, offering to reſtore all that they had taken from the Earle of Romont, who on the other ſide preſſed him earneſtly to ſuccour him in perſon: whereupon the Duke altered his minde, and determined to march againſt them, leauing that courſe which in all mens opinions ſeemed beſt, conſidering both the time of the yeere, and the ſtate of his armie. Further, it was agreed betweene the King and him, that for the Duchie of Lorraine they ſhould not fall at variance.</p>
               <p>The Duke departed out of Lorraine with this poore, wearie, and defeated armie, and entred into Burgundie, where the ambaſſadors of theſe ancient confederates of Almaine commonly called Swiſſers, repaired againe to him, making larger offers than before: for beſides the reſtitution of the Earle of Romonts places, they offered to depart from all leagues that he ſhould not allow of, eſpecially their league with the King, and to enter into confederacie with him, and to ſerue him againſt the King with ſixe thouſand men well armed (and that for very ſmal pay) as often as he ſhould require: which offers he refuſed; for God was fully purpoſed to bring him to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In thoſe countries are certaine townes called the new confederates, namely, Baſill, Strasbourg, and diuers other imperial cities <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP1.NOTE1">

But now all theſe townes ioined with the Swiſſers, and a league was made betweene them for ten yeeres, and peace alſo betweene Duke <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> and them: which league (as before you haue heard) was concluded by the Kings procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, earneſt ſute, and great expences, at the ſame time that the countie of Ferrette
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7649:87"/>
was taken from the Duke of Burgundie, and his lieutenant there called <hi>Peter Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambault</hi> beheaded at Baſill. The onely cauſe of which inconuenience proceeded of this <hi>Archambault</hi> himſelf, which ſure was a ſhrewd check to the Duke of Burgundy, being the very fountaine of all his other miſeries. Wherefore a Prince that hath lately ioined a ſtrange countrie to his dominions, ought to be circumſpect what go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors he placeth there. For whereas ſubiects newly conquered ought to be curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly intreated, to haue Iuſtice truly adminiſtred, and to be better vſed than vnder their former gouernment: this <hi>Archambault</hi> did the cleane contrary, for he vſed great violence and extortion; whereupon enſued vtter deſtruction to himſelfe, his Maſter, and many a good man beſides.</p>
               <p>This league aboue mentioned made by the Kings onely procurement, turned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to his great benefit, yea greater than the world weeneth, ſo far foorth that for my part, I account it one of the wiſeſt deeds that euer he did, and moſt to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his enimies. For the Duke of Burgundy once deſtroied, the King of Fraunce neuer found man afterward of his owne ſubiects that durſt lift vp his finger againſt him: for they ſailed all with his winde. Wherefore it was a woorthy exploit to ioine Duke <hi>Sigiſmunde</hi> of Auſtrich and theſe newe confederates in league with the Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, whoſe ancient enimies they had beene: and I warrant you it was neuer brought to paſſe without great expenſes and many voiages.</p>
               <p>After the Duke of Burgundy had put the Swiſſers from all hope of peace, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to aduertiſe their confederates therof, and to make preparations for defence. The Duke led his army into the countrey of Vaulx in Sauoye, which the Swiſſers (as you haue heard) had taken from the Lord of Romont. There he wan three or fower places belonging to Monſeur de Chaſteauguion, which the Swiſſers held, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently defended. From thence he remooued, and laid his ſiege before a towne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Granſon <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP1.NOTE2">

                  </ref> choice men: for bicauſe the place was neere their countrey they had manned it well. The Dukes force was reaſonable great, for diuers bands came daily to him out of Lombardy, and the ſubiects alſo of this houſe of Sauoy were in pay with him. He loued ſtrangers better than his owne ſubiects, notwithſtanding that he might haue leuied in his owne dominions great force of good ſoldiers: but the Conſtables death togither with certaine other conceits he had in his head, cauſed him to miſtruſt his owne people. His artillery was maruellous ſtrong, and he lay in great pompe and triumph in his campe, to ſhew his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to the ambaſſadors that came to him out of Italy and Almaine: for the which purpoſe alſo he had brought with him all his beſt iewels and plate, and great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all kinde of furniture. Moreouer he had many phanſies in his head touching the Duchy of Milan, where he truſted ſhortly to haue great intelligence. After he had beſieged this towne of Granſon, and battered it with the canon certaine daies, they yeelded to his mercy <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP1.NOTE4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref>, and he put them all cruelly to death. The Swiſſers were aſſembled, but in ſmall number, as diuers of them haue told me: for they are not able to leuy ſo great force in their countrey as the world ſuppoſeth, and at that time much leſſe than now, bicauſe ſithence moſt part of them haue forſaken their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry and giuen themſelues to armes. Further, of their confederates fewe were with them, bicauſe they were forced to ſuccor the place in haſte; but ſo ſoone as they were abroad in campe, they heard of their companions death. The Duke contrary to their opinion whoſe aduiſe he asked, determined to meete them at the entrie of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines where they yet lay, greatly to his owne diſaduantage: for he was encamped in a place very wel ſeated for the battel, being fortified on the one ſide with his artillery,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7649:87"/>
and on the other with a lake; ſo that by all preſumption they could not haue endo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged him. He had ſent a hundred archers before him to keepe a ſtrait directly ouer againſt the mountaine where the Swiſſers lay, and marched forward himſelfe, and his enimies encountred him, the greateſt part of his army being yet in the plaine. The firſt rankes of his men thought to retire to ioine with the reſt; but thoſe that were behinde, ſuppoſing theſe to flie, began to turne their backs, and by little and little the Dukes army retired towards his campe; ſome of them valiantly behauing themſelues. But to be ſhort, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they drew neere to their campe, they neuer ſtood to defence, but fled all <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP1.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref>. So that the Almaines wan the Dukes campe, his artillery, al his tents and pauilions and his mens alſo, (whereof there was great abundance) and other riches and treaſures infinite <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP1.NOTE6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref>: for nothing was ſaued but the men onely. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer the Duke loſt heere all his goodly iewels, notwithſtanding in this battell were ſlaine onely ſeauen men of armes; all the reſt fled, and himſelfe alſo. A man may iuſtlier ſay of him that he loſt this day honor and reputation, than of King <hi>Iohn</hi> of Fraunce, who valiantly defending himſelfe, was taken priſoner by the Engliſh men at the battell of Poictiers.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt misfortune that euer happened to this Duke: for all his other enterpriſes turned him either to honor or profit. But what a deadly wound receiued he this day by following his owne braine, and deſpiſing good aduiſe? what damage receiued his houſe heerby? in how miſerable eſtate is it yet, and ſhall be we knowe not how long? how many men became his enimies, and declared themſelues againſt him that the day before ſpake him faire, and temporized with him? And for what quarrell began this war? forſooth for a lode of ſheepes skins taken by the Earle of Romont from a Swiſſer paſſing through his countrie. Sure if God had not vtterly abandoned the Duke of Burgundie, it is not to be thought he would haue put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into ſo great danger for ſo ſmall a trifle, conſidering both the offers made him, and the men he had to do with, by vanquiſhing whom he could obtaine neither riches nor honor. For at that time the Swiſſers as touching their valor were not eſteemed as they be now, and their pouertie was ſo great, that a Knight of their countrie, who was one of their firſt ambaſſadors to the Duke, told me, that among diuers other reaſons he vſed to diſſwade him from this war, this was one: that by conquering them he could gaine nothing, bicauſe their countrie was barren and poore, and void of all good priſoners, ſo far foorth that he thought verily if all their countrie men were taken, they ſhould not be able to pay a raunſome to the value of the ſpurres and bridle bits in his campe.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the battell: the King being immediately aduertiſed of all that was happened, by the ſundrie ſpies and meſſengers he had abrode in the countrie, moſt of them were ſtrangers; reioiced much at theſe newes, and ſorrowed onely that ſo few were ſlaine. Further, bicauſe of theſe affaires he lay at Lyons, to the end he might the ſooner be aduertiſed of all that happened, and the better countermine all ſuch enterpriſes as the Duke had in his head. For the King being a wiſe Prince feared leaſt he ſhould ioine the Swiſſers to him by force. As touching the houſe of Sauoy, the Duke diſpoſed thereof as of his owne: the Duke of Milan was in league with him: King <hi>Rene</hi> of Sicilie was fully bent to haue put the countrie of Prouence into his hands. So that if his affaires had receiued good ſucceſſe, he ſhould haue held vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his dominion all that lieth betweene the weſt and eaſt ſeas, and haue ſo brideled the ſubiects of this realme, that they could haue ſtirred no way out of Fraunce but by ſea without his permiſſion: Sauoy, Prouence, and Lorraine being vnder his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. To euerie one of theſe Princes the King ſent ambaſſadors. The one, namely
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7649:88"/>
the Duches of Sauoy was his ſiſter, but friend to the Duke of Burgundie to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of hir power. The other, to wit, King <hi>Rene</hi> of Sicilie was his vnkle, who hardly gaue his ambaſſadors audience, but referred all matters to the Duke of Burgundie. The King ſent alſo to theſe confederates of Almaine, but with great difficultie; for bicauſe the paſſages were ſtopped, he was forced to ſend beggers, pilgrims, and ſuch kinde of men. The ſaid confederates gaue him a proud anſwer, that vnleſſe he would declare himſelfe for them, they would make peace with the Duke, and ioine with the Burgundians againſt him: which notwithſtanding that he greatly feared, yet thought he it not time as yet to diſcouer himſelfe the Dukes enimie, doubting alſo leaſt ſome of his meſſengers whom he ſent about the countrie ſhould be taken, and ſo all his practiſes diſcouered.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et vs now ſee how the world changed after the battell, and how the courage of the Duke of Burgundy and his confederates altered, and withall how wiſely the King gouerned his affaires. For this ſhall be a goodly example for yoong Princes that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt fooliſh enterpriſes, not conſidering what may enſue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and deſpiſe the counſell of thoſe whoſe aduiſe they ought to vſe, notwithſtanding that themſelues be vtterly void of all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. Firſt, the Duke himſelfe ſent the Lord of Contay to the King with a lowly and humble meſſage, contrarie both to his accuſtomed maner and to his nature. Marke heere how ſuddenly he was changed euen in a moment: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the King faithfully to keepe the truce, and excuſed himſelfe for not comming to the meeting appointed at Auxerre, promiſing ſhortly to meete him there or elſe where at his pleaſure. The King receiued the ſaid <hi>Contay</hi> very honorably, aſſuring him of all his demands: for as yet he thought it not time to declare himſelfe, bicauſe he knew well the loyalty of the Dukes ſubiects to be ſuch to their Prince, that he ſhould ſoone be aflote againe. Wherefore he was deſirous to ſee the end of this war, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giuing occaſion to either partie to make peace. But notwithſtanding the good entertainment the King gaue the ſaid <hi>Contay,</hi> yet heard he many ſcoffes and taunts in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7649:88"/>
the towne: for ballads were openly ſung in the commendation of the vanquiſhers, and reproch of his follie that was vanquiſhed.</p>
               <p>So ſoone as <hi>Galeas</hi> Duke of Milan (then liuing) vnderſtood of this aduenture, he reioiced not a little thereat, notwithſtanding that he were the D. of Burgundies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate: for he was entred into league with him for feare onely, ſeeing the Duke ſo highly fauored in Italie. Wherfore the ſaid D. of Milan ſent in all haſte to the King a citizen of Milan, a man of ſmall apparance, who by mediation of others was directed to me, and brought me a letter from the Duke: whereof when I had aduertiſed the King, he commanded me to heare his meſſage. For he would not giue him audience himſelfe, bicauſe he was diſpleaſed with the Duke of Milan for abandoning his league with him, to enter into confederacie with the Duke of Burgundie, and the rather for that his wife was the Queenes ſiſter. The ſaid ambaſſadors meſſage was, that his Maſter the Duke of Milan was aduertiſed that the King and the Duke of Burgundie ſhould meete to conclude a finall peace and a league greatly to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters diſcontentation, &amp; diuers ſlender reaſons he alleaged to diſſwade the K. from the concluſion thereof. But his laſt perſwaſion was, that if the K. would be bound to make neither peace nor truce with the D. of Burgundie, his M. would preſently giue him 100000. ducats. When the K. heard the ſubſtance of his ambaſſage, he cauſed him to come to his preſence, my ſelfe only being with him, and ſaid thus briefly vnto him: Heere is Monſeur d'Argenton that aduertiſeth me thus and thus: tell your M. I will none of his monie; for I leauie once in a yeere thriſe as much as he. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching peace or war, I will diſpoſe thereof at my pleaſure: but if your Maſter repent him that he hath forſaken his league with me, to enter into confederacie with the Duke of Burgundie, tell him I am contented that the league betweene vs ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as it was firſt concluded. The ambaſſador gaue him moſt humble thanks, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing him by his anſwer to be no couetous Prince, and deſired that it would pleaſe him to cauſe the ſaid league betweene him and his Maſter to be proclaimed in maner and forme as it was firſt concluded, ſaying that he had power to binde his Maſter to agree thereunto. The K. was contented, and after dinner it was proclaimed, &amp; an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador foorthwith diſpatched to Milan, where the league was againe proclaimed with great ſolemnitie. This is one blowe aduerſitie gaue the Duke of Burgundie: for heere is one mightie Prince ſuddenly fallen from him; who had ſent a great and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ambaſſage to enter into league with him but three weekes before.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Rene</hi> of Sicilie was purpoſed to make the Duke of Burgundy his heire, and to put Prouence into his hands, ſo far forth that Monſeur de Chaſteauguion that now is, and diuers others were already gone into Piemont with 20000. crownes to leuy men to take poſſeſſion of the ſaid countrey for the Duke of Burgundy: but vpon the newes of this ouerthrow they fled, and hardly ſaued themſelues; and as touching their money, the Lord of Breſſe being then in thoſe parts tooke it. The Duches of Sauoy hearing theſe newes ſent word thereof immediately to King <hi>Rene</hi> of Sicilie, extenuating the ouerthrow, and willing him to be of good cheere, notwithſtanding this ſmall loſſe: but hir meſſengers being Prouincials were intercepted, and thereby King <hi>Renes</hi> practiſe with the Duke of Burgundy diſcouered. Whereupon the King ſent forces to the frontiers of Prouence <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP2.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>, and ambaſſadors to the King of Sicilie, deſiring him to come to him and aſſuring him of good entertainment, which if he refuſed to do, he threatned by force to preuent this inconuenience. Wherefore in the end the King of Sicilie agreed to repaire to Lions to the King, where he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably receiued and well feaſted. I was with the King and heard the words that paſſed betweene them at their firſt meeting: which being ended, <hi>Iohn Coſſe</hi> Seneſchal
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7649:89"/>
of Prouence, a woorthy gentleman and of a good houſe in the realme of Naples, ſaid thus to the King. Sir, you muſt not maruell if the King my Maſter your Vncle offered to make the Duke of Burgundy his heire: for he was counſelled thereunto by his ſeruants, eſpecially by my ſelfe, bicauſe you being his ſiſters ſonne &amp; his nephew, haue done him ſo great wrong in taking from him the caſtels of Bar and Angiers, and handled him ſo ill in all his other affaires. Wherefore we meant to enter into this practiſe with the Duke of Burgundy, to the end that you hearing this newes might indeuor your ſelfe to repaire the iniuries you haue done vs, and acknowledge in the end the King our Maſter to be your Vncle: but we neuer minded to bring this treaty to a full concluſion. The King being a wiſe Prince tooke this practiſe in good part, which the ſaid <hi>Iohn Coſſe</hi> vttered indeed ſimply as it was meant; for he himſelfe was the onely contriuer thereof. In ſhort ſpace all controuerſies between them were ended, and money was giuen to the King of Sicilie and his ſeruants. Further, the King feaſted him with the Ladies, and vſed him in all points according to his owne humor as neere as he could; and of the Duke of Burgundy no more mention was made, but he was vtterly abandoned of King <hi>Rene.</hi> This is another miſhap that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued this ſmall aduerſity.</p>
               <p>The Duches alſo of Sauoye who of long time was thought great enimy to the King hir brother, ſent one Monſeur <hi>de Montaigny</hi> (who was addreſſed to me) with a ſecret meſſage to reconcile hir ſelfe to the King, alleaging diuers reaſons why ſhee was fallen out with him, and wherein ſhe ſtood in feare of him. Notwithſtanding ſhe was a verie wiſe Ladie and the Kings ſiſter indeed: for it appeered that ſhe meant to temporize as he did, to ſee what would happen further to the Duke before ſhe would abandon him. The King gaue hir better words than he was accuſtomed, and ſent the meſſenger very good anſwers by me, willing him to deſire his Miſtres to come into Fraunce; and thus hir man was diſpatched. See heere an other of the Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundies confederats practiſing to forſake him. Beſides this, through the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Almaine enimies began to declare themſelues againſt him, and all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall townes, as Nuremberg, Francfort and diuers others, ioined themſelues with theſe old and new confederates of Swiſſerland: ſo that all the world ſeemed to be perſwaded the doing of him harme to be good ſeruice to God.</p>
               <p>The ſpoiles of his campe enriched maruellouſly theſe poore Swiſſers, who at the firſt knew not what treaſures were fallen into their hands, eſpecially thoſe of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſort: one of the goodlieſt &amp; richeſt pauilions in the world was torne al to peeces. There were that ſold a number of ſiluer plates and diſhes for two ſouſe a peece, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to be pewter. The Dukes great diamond being the goodlieſt iewell in Chriſtendome, at the which hung a great orient pearle, was taken vp by a Swiſſer, who put it againe into the boxe where it was kept and threw it vnder a cart; but after returned to ſeeke it, and ſold it to a Prieſt for a guldon, who ſent it to the Lords of their countrey, of whom he receiued three franks for it. They wan alſo three goodly ballais rubies, called the three brethren, bicauſe they were in all points like, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great ballais rubie called <hi>La hotte,</hi> with a goodly ſtone called the round ball of Flaunders, the greateſt and faireſt ſtones in the world. Other infinite treaſures they gained alſo; which ſince hath taught them to know what is money woorth. Further, the victories they obtained, the account the King made of them euer after, and the ſummes of money he beſtowed vpon them, haue maruellouſly enriched them. Euery ambaſſador of theirs that came to him at the beginning of theſe wars, receiued goodly preſents of him either in money or plate, wherby he aſſwaged the diſpleaſure they had conceiued againſt him for not declaring himſelfe the Duke of Burgundies
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7649:89"/>
enimy: for he ſent them home well contented, with full purſes and clothed in ſilkes and veluets. Then began he alſo to promiſe them a yeerely penſion of 40000. gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, which afterward he truly paied, but the ſecond battell was paſt firſt. Of this penſion twenty thouſand guldons were for the townes, and the other twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand for the gouernors of the townes. And I thinke verily I ſhould not lie, if I ſaid that betweene the firſt battell of Granſon and the King our Maſters death, theſe townes and gouernors of the Swiſſers receiued out of Fraunce aboue a million of florens. When I name townes I meane but theſe fower: Berne, Lucerne, Friburge, and Zurich, togither with their cantons ſituate in the mountaines. Swiſſe alſo is one of their cantons though but a village. Yet haue I ſeene an ambaſſador of that village clothed in very ſimple apparell giue his aduiſe in euery matter as well as any of the reſt. The other two cantons are called Soleurre and Vnderwalde.</p>

For you ſhall vnderſtand that the ſaid Prince about a yeere before the battell, was come to the Duke of Burgundy with a goodly traine in hope to marrie his daughter and heir. And notwithſtanding that his behauiour, apparell and traine ſhewed him indeed to be a Kings ſonne, and his father the King of Naples to haue ſpared no coſt in ſetting him foorth: yet did the Duke but diſſemble with him, and fed at the ſelfe ſame time with faire promiſes the Duches of Sauoye putting her in hope of this marriage for hir ſonne. Wherefore the Prince of Tarente called <hi>Don Frederick</hi> of Arragon and his Counſell miſliking theſe delaies, ſent to the King our Maſter a herault of armes a wiſe fellow, who humbly beſought him to grant the Prince his ſafe conduct to paſſe through his realme to the King his father who had ſent for him, which he eaſily obtained of the King, bicauſe it ſeemed to tende to the Duke of Burgundies diſhonor and diſcredit. Notwithſtanding before the Princes meſſenger was returned to his Maſter, a great number of theſe confederated townes were aſſembled and encamped hard by the Duke of Burgundie. The ſaid Prince obeying the King his fathers commandement tooke his leaue of the Duke the night before the ſecond battell was fought, for at the firſt he was preſent, and behaued himſelfe like a valiant gentleman. Some ſay (my Lord of Vienna) that he vſed your aduiſe heerein: for when he was heere with the King I haue heard both him and the

               <p>At the Princes departure, great forces of theſe confederate townes were incam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped (as I haue ſaid) hard by the Duke of Burgundy, and came to giue him battell, meaning to leuie the ſiege he held before Morat <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP3.NOTE3">

The ſaid townes had in their army (as ſome that were at the battell haue informed me) 35000. men, whereof fower thouſand were horſemen, the reſt footemen well choſen and well armed; that is to ſay, 11000. pikes, 10000. halberds, and ten thouſand harquebuſiers. Their whole force was not yet aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and theſe onely fought the battell, neither needed any more helpe. The Duke of Lorraine arriued at their campe a little before the battell, with a very ſmall traine, which his comming turned afterward to his great profit: for the Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy helde then all his countrey, and a happy turne it was for him that they waxed weary of him in our Court, as al thoſe that maintaine a noble man ouerthrowen vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do; notwithſtanding he neuer vnderſtood thus much. The King gaue him a ſmal ſumme of money, and ſent a good troupe of men of armes to conueigh him ſafe through Lorraine; who brought him to the frontiers of Almaine, and then returned home. This Duke of Lorraine had not onely loſt his Duchy of Lorraine, the County of Vaudemont, and the greateſt part of Barrois (the reſt being withheld from him by the King, ſo that he had nothing left:) but his ſubiects alſo, yea his houſehold ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants had voluntarie done homage to the Duke of Burgundy: ſo that his eſtate ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med almoſt irrecouerable.

               <p>After the Duke of Lorraine was paſſed through Lorraine into Almaine, and had iourneied a few daies, he arriued at the Almaines campe with ſmall force three or fower howers before the battell began: which voiage (as before I haue ſaid) turned to his great honor and profit; for if his ſucceſſe had beene bad, I thinke he ſhould haue found but cold entertainment in any place. At the very inſtant that he arriued, the battels marched on both ſides. For the confederates had lien in campe three daies or more in a ſtrong place hard by the Duke of Burgundie, who was at the very firſt diſcomfited and put to flight <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP3.NOTE4">

Further, their battell of footemen ioined alſo with the Dukes battell, which was mightie and ſtrong: for beſides great force of his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and certaine Engliſh men that ſerued him; diuers bands were newly come to him out of Piemont and the Duchie of Milan. So that the Prince of Tarente at his being heere with the King told me, that he neuer ſaw in his life ſo goodly an armie: for he himſelfe and diuers others by his commandement numbring the force as it paſſed ouer a bridge, had told to the number of 23000. ſoldiers taking pay, beſides thoſe that followed the armie and were appointed to ſerue at the artillerie; which force me thinke was great, notwithſtanding that many talke of millions, and report they wot not what, making armies fiue times greater than they are.

Wherefore by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of thoſe that were about him, he made the Ducheſſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy and one of hir children now Duke of Sauoy, to be led by force into Burgundie: but hir eldeſt ſonne was conueied away by certaine of hir ſeruants; for thoſe that committed this outrage did it in great feare and vpon a ſudden. The cauſe that mooued the Duke heerunto was partly feare, leaſt the Ducheſſe ſhould retire to the King hir brother; and partly bicauſe all theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes were happened to him (as he ſaid) for ſuccouring this houſe of Sauoy.

When the Ducheſſe was come to Rouure accompanied with all hir wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and a great number of hir ſeruants; ſhe perceiuing the Duke of Burgundie to be buſied in leuying men, and thoſe that garded hir not to ſtand in ſuch feare of their Maſter as they were accuſtomed: determined to ſend to the King hir brother to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile hir ſelfe to him, and to deſire him to deliuer hir out of this thraldome. For notwithſtanding that ſhe feared much to fall into his hands, bicauſe of the great and long hatred that had been betweene them: yet the miſerie wherein ſhe was, forced hir in the end thereunto. Wherefore ſhe ſent to him a gentleman of Piemont called <hi>Riuerol</hi> being ſteward of hir houſe, who was directed to me. When I had heard his meſſage, and aduertiſed the King thereof, he commanded him to come to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: and after he had giuen him audience, anſwered, that he would not forſake his ſiſter in this extremitie notwithſtanding their former variance: and that if ſhe would enter into league with him, he would ſend for hir by the gouernor of Champaigne, called Maſter <hi>Charles</hi> of Amboiſe Lord of Chaumont. The ſaid <hi>Riuerol</hi> tooke his leaue of the King, and returned with ſpeede to his Miſtres, who reioiced much at this newes. Notwithſtanding ſhe ſent yet againe to the King vpon the returne of the firſt meſſage, to deſire a ſafe conduct and aſſurance therein, that ſhe ſhould depart out of Fraunce into Sauoy, and that the Duke hir ſonne and his little brother, togither with the places which the King held, ſhould be reſtored to hir: and further that he would helpe to maintaine hir authoritie in Sauoy; and ſhe for hir part would forſake all confederacies, and enter into league with him. All the which hir requeſts the King granted, and immediately ſent a man purpoſely to the ſaid Lord of Chaumont about this enterpriſe: the which was well deuiſed and executed accordingly. For the ſaid Lord of Chaumont went himſelfe peaceably through the country with a good band of men to Rouure, from whence he led the Ducheſſe of Sauoy and all hir traine to the next place of the Kings dominions. Before the diſpatch of the Ducheſſes laſt meſſenger, the King was departed from Lyons, where he had lien halfe a yeere to ouerthrow couertly the Duke of Burgundies enterpriſes without breaking the truce. But if a man conſider well the Dukes eſtate, the King made ſharper war vpon him by letting him run himſelfe out of breth, and priuily ſtirring vp enimies againſt him, than if he had openly proclaimed war. For immediately vpon the proclamation, the Duke would haue relinquiſhed his enterpriſe, and then all theſe miſhaps had neuer fallen vpon him.</p>
               <p>The King being departed from Lions continued ſtill his iourney, and from Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenne went downe the riuer of Loire to Tours, where at his arriuall he receiued newes of his ſiſters liberty; whereat he reioiced not a little, and ſent for hir with all ſpeed to come to him, and gaue order for hir charges vpon the way. Moreouer, when ſhe drew neere, he ſent a great company of gentlemen to wait vpon hir, and went himſelfe to receiue hir as far as the gate of Pleſſis du Parc; where at their firſt meeting with a mery countenaunce he ſaid vnto hir: Lady of Burgundy you are hartely welcome. Then ſhe knowing by his countenance that he did but ſport, made him a wiſe anſwer ſaying. Sir, I am a true French woman, and ready to obey you in all you ſhall command. The King led hir to hir chamber, where ſhe was very hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably entertained. True it is that he deſired to ſend hir home as ſpeedily as might be,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7649:91"/>
whereof ſhe was no leſſe deſirous than he: for ſhe was a very wiſe woman, and they were well acquainted the one with the others conditions. The whole charge of this matter was committed to me, firſt to prouide money to defray hir in hir returne: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily to ſeeke ſilkes and veluets for hir: and laſtly to put in writing the articles of their new league and amity. Moreouer, the King indeuored to diſſwade hir from the mariage of hir two daughters aboue mentioned; but ſhe made hir excuſe by the daughters themſelues, who were obſtinate therein: which when the King perceiued he yeelded vnto them, and in mine opinion they were well beſtowed. After the Duches had ſoiourned at Pleſſis ſeauen or eight daies, the King and ſhe ſware thence foorth to be friends each to other, and writings touching their amitie were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changably deliuered betweene them: which done, the Duches tooke hir leaue of the King, who cauſed hir ſafely to be conueighed into hir owne countrey, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto hir, hir children, all the places that were in his hands, all hir iewels, and all that belonged to hir.

which before he ware long. But in mine opinion after this ſicknes his wits were neuer ſo freſh as before, but much weakned and decaied. Such are the paſſions of thoſe that being fallen into great misfortunes ſeeke not the true remedies, eſpecially of proud and diſdainfull Princes. For in ſuch a caſe the beſt and ſoueraigneſt remedy is to haue recourſe to God, to bethinke our ſelues if we haue in any point offended him, to humble our ſelues before him, and to acknowledge our faults: for he it is that determineth theſe cauſes, and to him no man may impute any error. The ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in ſuch a caſe is to conferre with ſome familiar friend, to reueale boldly vnto him all our paſſions, and not to be aſhamed to vtter our greefe to our deere friend: for that eaſeth and comforteth the minde, and by talking thus in counſell with a faithfull friend, the ſpirits recouer their former vertue and ſtrength. The third reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in ſuch a caſe is to fall to ſome exerciſe &amp; bodily labor: for ſeeing we are men ſuch penſiuenes &amp; greefe can not be paſſed ouer without great paſſions either publike or priuate <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP5.NOTE1">

Further, bicauſe he was a terrible Prince to his ſeruants, none durſt preſume to giue him counſell or comfort, but ſuffered him to follow his owne ſenſe, fearing if they had gone about to perſwade with him, it might haue turned them to diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>During this ſixe weekes ſpace or thereabout that he ſoiorned at La Riuiere with ſmall force, (which was no maruell hauing loſt two ſo great battels) many new eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies aroſe againſt him, his friends fell from him, his ſubiects being defeated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited began to murmur and deſpiſe him, which is a thing vſuall (as before I haue ſaid) in ſuch aduerſities. Further, many places in Lorraine were either razed or woon from him, namely Vaudemont, Eſpinall, and diuers others, and on euery ſide enimies prepared to inuade him, and the miſerableſt ſlaues were the hardieſt. In this hurliburly the Duke of Lorraine aſſembled a ſmall force &amp; came before Nancy: of the little townes thereabout he held the greateſt part; notwithſtanding the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians kept ſtill Pont-à-mouſſon being fower leagues diſtant from Nancy.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe that were beſieged within the ſaid towne of Nancy, was a worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full knight called Monſeur <hi>de Beures</hi> of the houſe of Croy, who had vnder him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine harquebuſiers; within the towne was alſo an Engliſh captaine though but of meane parentage, yet very valiant called <hi>Colpin</hi>

And to ſay the truth, he committed a foule ouerſight in that he approched no neere to Lorraine, but lay thus in a place far off &amp; where he could do no ſeruice: ſith it ſtood him more vpon to defend that he had already gotten, than to inuade the Swiſſers in hope to reuenge his loſſes. But his obſtinacie turned him to great inconuenience, in that he would aske no mans aduiſe, but truſted wholy to his owne braine: for notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they that were beſieged continually, and earneſtly ſollicited him to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the place; yet lay he ſtill vpon no neceſſitie, at the ſaid towne of Riuiere ſixe weekes or thereabout; whereas if he had done otherwiſe, he might eaſily haue relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the towne. For the Duke of Lorraine had no force before it, and by defending the countrie of Lorraine the paſſage from his other ſeniories into Burgundy ſhould euer haue been open through Luxembourg and Lorraine. Wherefore if his wits had been ſuch then as before time I had knowen them, he would ſure haue vſed greater diligence.</p>

During the time that they within Nancy looked daily for ſuccours, <hi>Colpin</hi> aboue mentioned, Captaine of the Engliſh band within the towne, was ſlaine with a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhot greatly to the Duke of Burgundies loſſe. For the preſence of one man alone endued with vertue and wiſedome, though but of baſe race and parentage, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes deliuereth his Maſter from great incoueniences. As touching the which point I commend aboue all others the wiſedome of the King our Maſter: for neuer Prince feared ſo much the Loſſe of his men as he did. <hi>Colpin</hi> being thus ſlaine, the Engliſh men within the towne began to mutine and deſpaire of ſuccours: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew they of how ſmall power the Duke of Lorraine was, nor what goodly meanes the Duke of Burgundie had to leuie new forces. Further, bicauſe of long time the Engliſh men had made no wars out of their owne realme, they vnderſtood not what the ſiege of a towne meant. Wherefore they reſolued in the end to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, and told Monſeur <hi>de Beures</hi> captaine of the towne, that if he would not fall to compoſition with the Duke of Lorraine, they would compound without him. He notwithſtanding that he were a truſtie Knight lacked courage, and fell to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and perſwaſions; whereas in mine opinion ſtouter language would better haue preuailed: but God had already diſpoſed heerof. If the towne had been held but three daies longer, it had been releeued. To conclude, the ſaid <hi>de Beures</hi> agreed to the Engliſh men, and yeelded the place to the Duke of Lorraine <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP5.NOTE3">

               <p>The next day or at the furtheſt within two daies after the towne was yeelded, the Duke of Burgundie arriued there well accompanied conſidering his eſtate: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bands were come to him from Luxembourg, which had beene leuied in his other ſeniories. Before Nancy the Duke of Lorraine and he met; but no great exploit was done, bicauſe the Duke of Lorrains force was ſmall. The ſaid Duke of Burgundie continuing ſtill his former enterpriſe, determined to lay his ſiege againe before Nancy: wherefore better it had beene for him not to haue delaide ſo long vpon ſelfewill the ſuccouring of the towne. But God giueth ſuch extraordinarie mindes to Princes when he is purpoſed to alter their good ſucceſſe. If the Duke would haue followed good aduiſe, and manned well the ſmall places about the towne, he might eaſily in ſhort ſpace haue recouered it: for it was vnfurniſhed of victuals, and he had men ynow, yea too many to haue held it in greater diſtreſſe. In the meane time he might commodiouſly haue refreſhed and repaired his army, but he tooke the contrary courſe.</p>

Chap. 6.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Vring the time the Duke of Burgundy held before Nancy this ſiege, vnfortunate to himſelfe, to all his ſubiects, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others whom this quarrell in no wiſe concerned: diuers of his men began to practiſe his deſtruction. For (as you haue heard) many enimies were now riſen againſt him on all ſides, and among others <hi>Nicholas</hi> Earle of Campobache in the realm of Naples, whence he was baniſhed for the houſe of Anious faction. This Earle after the death of <hi>Nicholas</hi> Duke of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria whom he ſerued, hauing as I ſaid before neither lands nor liuing; was receiued with diuers others of the ſaid Duke of Calabrias ſeruants into the Duke of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies houſe, who at his firſt comming deliuered him 40000. ducats in preſt to go into Italy to leuy therewith fower hundred launces that were vnder the ſaid Earles charge and paied by himſelfe. From the which day forward euen till this preſent he euer ſought his Maſters deſtruction, and now ſeeing him in this aduerſitie began to practiſe a freſh againſt him, both with the Duke of Lorraine and alſo with certaine of the Kings captaines and ſeruants that lay in Champaigne neere to the Dukes campe. To the Duke of Lorraine he promiſed ſo to order the matter, that this ſiege ſhould take no effect. For he would finde meanes that ſuch things as were neceſſary both for the ſiege and battery ſhould be lacking; which promiſe he was well able to performe, for the principall charge thereof was committed to him; neither had any man ſo great authority in the army vnder the Duke of Burgundy as he. But his practiſes with the Kings captaines touched the quick neerer: for he continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them either to kill his Maſter or take him priſoner, demaunding for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thereof the charge of theſe fower hundred launces, twenty thouſand crowns to be deliuered him in ready money, and ſome good Earledome in Fraunce.</p>
               <p>While this Earle was practiſing theſe treaſons, certaine of the Duke of Lorraines gentlemen attempted to enter the towne of Nancy. Some of the which entred, and ſome were taken, among whom was one <hi>Cifron</hi> a gentleman born in Prouence, who was the onely man that entertained theſe practiſes betweene the Earle of Campo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bache and the ſaid Duke of Lorraine. The D. of Burgundy preſently commanded this <hi>Cifron</hi> to be hanged, alleaging that by the law of armes after a Prince hath laid his ſiege before a place and made his battery, if any man attempt to enter to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thoſe that are beſieged he ought to die. Yet is this law not practiſed in our wars which are much crueller then the wars of Italy or Spaine where it is put in vſe. But law or no law, the D. would that in any wiſe this gentleman ſhould die, who ſeeing no remedy, ſent word to the D. that if it would pleaſe him to giue him audience he would reueale a ſecret to him that touched his life; whereof certaine gentlemen to whom he vttered this ſpeech went to aduertiſe the Duke: with whom at their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall they found the Earle of Campobache, come thither either by chance or of purpoſe to be alwais at hand, fearing leaſt <hi>Cifron</hi> whom he knew to be taken ſhould
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7649:93"/>
reueale all his conſpiracies: for he was priuy to them all; and that was indeed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret he would haue diſcouered. The Duke made anſwer to theſe gentlemen that brought him this meſſage, that he vſed this delay onely to ſaue his life, commanding him to open the matter to them: vpon the which word the Earle of Campobache laid hold, perſwading the Duke that ſo it ſhould be beſt. For you ſhall vnderſtand that none of the Dukes counſell, neither any other perſons were preſent with him at the debating of this matter, but this Earle onely who had charge of the whole army, and a Secretary that was writing. The priſoner anſwered that he would vtter it to no man but to the Duke onely: whereupon the Duke commanded him againe to be led to execution, and ſo he was. But vpon the way thitherward, he deſired diuers gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to intreat the Duke their Maſter for him; affirming this to be ſuch a ſecret as the Duke would not for a Duchy but know. Many that were acquainted with him pitied him, &amp; went to deſire the Duke to vouchſafe him the hearing. But this traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Earle, who kept the Dukes chamber (being of timber) ſo ſtraightly that no man might enter in: refuſed the doore to theſe gentlemen, ſaying that the Duke had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be hanged with ſpeed; and further ſent diuers meſſengers to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoſt to haſten the execution. Thus was this <hi>Cifron</hi> hanged to the Duke of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies great preiudice, and better had it been for him to haue vſed leſſe cruelty, and gently to haue heard this gentleman; which if he had done, peraduenture he had been yet liuing, his houſe floriſhing, his dominions in ſafety, yea and much inlarged, conſidering the broiles that haue hapned ſince in this realme.</p>
               <p>But it is to be thought that God had otherwiſe diſpoſed heereof, bicauſe of the diſhonorable part the Duke had plaide the Earle of Saint Paule Conſtable of Fraunce not long before. For you haue already heard in this hiſtorie how notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his ſafe conduct, he took him priſoner, deliuered him to the King to put him to death, and ſent alſo all the letters and writings he had of the ſaid Conſtables ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for his proceſſe. And although the Duke had iuſt cauſe to hate him euen to the death, and to procure his death for diuers conſiderations too long to rehearſe, (ſo that he might haue done it without ſtayning his honor:) yet all the reaſons that may be alleaged on his behalfe, cannot excuſe his fault in that contrarie to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe &amp; honor, hauing giuen him a ſufficient ſafe conduct; he tooke him and ſold him for couetouſnes, partly to recouer the towne of S. Quintin with other the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables places, lands and goods; and partlie to ſtay the King from hindering his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe at Nancy when he firſt beſieged it. For lying at that ſiege, after many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies he deliuered the Conſtable, fearing leaſt the Kings army being in Champaigne would haue hindered his ſaid enterpriſe if he had done otherwiſe. For the King threatened him by his ambaſſadors, bicauſe it was agreed betweene them, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them could firſt lay hands vpon him, ſhould deliuer him to the other within eight daies, or put him to death. But the Duke had paſſed the terme of the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles deliuerie many daies as you haue heard; ſo that the onely feare of loſing Nancy, and the greedie deſire of hauing it cauſed the Duke to deliuer him to the King. But euen as in this place of Nancy he committed this foule fault, and afterward alſo in the ſame place at the ſecond ſiege put <hi>Cifron</hi> to death, refuſing to heare him ſpeake, as one hauing his eares ſtopped and wits troubled: euen ſo in the ſelfeſame place was he himſelfe deceiued, and betraied by him whom he moſt truſted, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture iuſtly puniſhed for his falſe dealing with the Conſtable, in deliuering him for couetouſnes to haue the ſaid towne. But the iudgement heerof appertaineth to God alone, neither ſpeake I it to any other end but to declare this matter at large, and to ſhew how much a good Prince ought to eſchew ſuch falſe and faithleſſe dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7649:94"/>
what counſell ſoeuer be giuen him thereunto. For oftentimes thoſe that giue a Prince ſuch aduiſe; do it either to flatter him, or bicauſe they dare not gainſay him: and yet when the fault is committed, they are ſorrie for it, knowing the puniſhment both of God and man that is like to enſue. But ſuch councellors are better far from a Prince than neere about him.</p>
               <p>You haue heard how God appointed this Earle of Campobache his deputie in this world, to take reuenge of the Conſtables death committed by the Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie, in the ſelfeſame place, and after the ſame manner, or rather a crueller. For euen as the Duke contrarie to his ſafe conduct and the truſt the Conſtable had repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him, deliuered him to death: euen ſo was himſelfe betraied by the truſtieſt man in his armie (I meane by him whom he moſt truſted) and whom he had receiued into his ſeruice being old, poore, and deſtitute of liuing, and whom he yeerely entertained with an hundred thouſand ducats, wherewith this Earle himſelfe paied his men of armes, beſides diuers other great benefits that he had receiued at the Dukes hands. And when he firſt began to conſpire his death he was going into Italie with 40000. ducats, which (as you haue heard) he had receiued in preſt of the Duke to leuie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his men of armes. Moreouer, the better to execute his traiterous enterpriſe, he practiſed in two places, firſt with a phyſition dwelling in Lyons called Maſter <hi>Simon</hi> of Pauia; &amp; afterward with the Kings ambaſſador in Sauoy, as before I haue rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Againe at his returne out of Italie, his men of armes lying in certaine ſmall towns in the countie of Marle which is in Lannois, he began anew to practiſe againſt his Maſter, offering either to deliuer into the Kings hands all the places he held: or when the King ſhould be in battell againſt his Maſter, a priuie token to be between them; vpon the ſight whereof he would turne with all his companie to the King againſt the Duke his Maſter. But this laſt ouerture pleaſed not the King. He offered yet further, ſo ſoone as his Maſter ſhould be abrode with his armie, either to take him priſoner or to kill him, as he went to view the ſeate of his campe; which laſt enterpriſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he would haue executed. For the Dukes manner was when he alighted from his horſe at the place where he encamped, to diſarme himſelfe all ſauing his quirace, and to mount vpon a little nagge, accompanied onely with eight or ten archers on foote, or ſomtime two or three gentlemen of his chamber; in the which eſtate he vſed to ride about his campe, to ſee if it were well incloſed: ſo that the ſaid Earle might with ten horſes eaſily haue executed his enterpriſe. But the King deteſting the continuall treaſons of this man againſt his Maſter, eſpecially this laſt being attempted in time of truce; and further not knowing throughly to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he made theſe offers: determined of a noble courage to diſcouer them to the Duke of Burgundie; and accordingly aduertiſed him at large of them all by the Lord of Contay (ſo often before named) I my ſelfe being preſent when he declared them to the ſaid <hi>Contay,</hi> who I am ſure like a faithfull ſeruant reuealed them to his Maſter. But the Duke taking all in euill part, ſaid that if it were ſo, the King would neuer haue aduertiſed him thereof. This was long afore he laid his ſiege before Nancy; yet think I that he neuer ſpake word thereof to the ſaid Earle: for he loued him euer after ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better than woorſe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et vs now returne to our principall matter, I meane the ſiege the Duke held before Nancy, which he began in the middeſt of winter with ſmall force, euill armed, euill paide, and the moſt part ſicke. The mightieſt in his campe practiſed againſt him as you haue heard, and generally they murmured all, and deſpiſed all his dooings, as in aduerſitie commonly it happeneth: but none attempted ought againſt his perſon or eſtate, ſaue this Earle of Campobache onely; for in his ſubiects no diſloialtie was found. While he lay there in this poore eſtate, the Duke of Lorraine treated with the confederated townes before named, to leuie men in their territories to fight with the Duke of Burgundie lying before Nancy, whereunto all the townes eaſily agreed, but the Duke of Lorraine lacked monie: wherefore the King ſent ambaſſadors to the Swiſſers in his fauor, and lent him alſo 40000. franks towards the paiment of his Almains. Further, the Lord of Cran who was then the Kings lieutenant in Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne, lay in Barrois with ſeuen or eight hundred launces and certaine franke ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers led by very expert captaines. The Duke of Lorraine by meanes of the Kings fauor and monie, drew vnto his ſeruice great force of Almains as well horſemen as footemen, beſides the which the townes alſo furniſhed a great number of their owne charge. Moreouer, with the ſaid Duke were many gentlemen of this realme, and the Kings armie as I ſaid before lay in Barrois, which made no war, but waited to ſee to whether part the victorie would incline. The Duke of Lorraine being accompanied with theſe Almaines aboue mentioned, came and lodged at Saint Nicholas two leagues from Nancy.</p>
               <p>The King of Portugale had beene in this realme at that preſent the ſpace of nine moneths: for the King our Maſter was entred into league with him againſt the King of Spaine that now is. Whereupon the ſaid King of Portugale came into Fraunce, hoping that the King would lend him a great armie to inuade Caſtile by the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires of Biſcay or Nauarre. For the ſaid King of Portugale held certaine places in Caſtile bordering vpon Portugale, and certaine alſo vpon the confines of Fraunce; namely, the caſtell of Bourgues, and diuers others: ſo that if the King had aided him as once he was purpoſed, it is like his enterpriſe had taken effect: but the King altered his minde, and foded him foorth with faire words the ſpace of a yeer or more. During the which time his affaires in Caſtile daily impaired: for at his comming into France all the nobles in maner of the realme of Caſtile tooke part with him, but bicauſe of his long abſence, by little and little they altered their minds, and made peace with King <hi>Ferrande</hi> and Queene <hi>Iſabell</hi> now raigning. The King our Maſter excuſed his not aiding him according to his promiſe by the wars in Lorraine, alleaging that he feared that the Duke of Burgundie (if he recouered his loſſes) would foorthwith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade him.

the King and him, to the end that then the King might aide him: for he was aſhamed to returne into Caſtile or Portugale in this eſtate hauing done no good heere in Fraunce; and the rather bicauſe he had taken this iourney vpon him verie raſhly, and contrarie to the aduiſe of the moſt of his counſell. Wherefore he put himſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way in the middeſt of winter to go to the Duke of Burgundy his coſin lying before Nancy: where at his arriuall he began to treat with him according to the Kings inſtructions. But perceiuing it an impoſſibilitie to agree them bicauſe their demands were contrarie in all points; after he had remained there two daies he tooke his leaue of the Duke of Burgundie his coſin, and returned to Paris from whence he came. The Duke deſired him to ſtaie a while, and to go to Pont-à-muſſon fower leagues from Nancy to defend that paſſage: for the Duke was already aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed that the Almains army lay at Saint Nicholas. But the King of Portugale ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelfe, ſaying: that he was neither armed nor accompanied for ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe; and ſo returned to Paris, where he remained a long time, till in the ende he entered into ielouſie, that the King meant to take him priſoner and deliuer him to his enimie the King of Caſtile. Wherupon he and two of his ſeruants diſguiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, purpoſing to go to Rome there to enter into religion. But as he iourneied in this diſguiſed attire, he was taken by a Norman called <hi>Robinet le Beuf.</hi> Of this his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture the King our Maſter was both ſorie and aſhamed: and thereupon armed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſhips vpon the coaſt of Normandie to conuey him into Portugale; of the which fleete <hi>George Leger</hi> was appointed Admirall.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Would haue paſſed ouer this diſcourſe of the King of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, had it not been to ſhew that a Prince ought to beware how he put himſelfe into another Princes hands, or go in perſon to demaund aide. But now to returne to the principall matter. Within a day after the King of Portugales departure from the Duke of Burgundy, the Duke of Lorraine and the Almains that ſerued him, diſlodged from Saint Nicholas, and marched to fight with the ſaid Duke; and the ſelfe ſame day the Earle of Campobache to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his enterpriſe departed from the Dukes campe <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP8.NOTE1">

                  </ref>, and reuolted to his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with eight ſcore men of armes, ſorowing onely that he could do his Maſter no more harme. They within Nancy had intelligence of this Earles practiſes, which incouraged them to endure the ſiege. Further, one that leaped downe the ditches entered the towne and aſſured them of ſuccors, otherwiſe they were vpon the point to haue yeelded it. And to ſay the truth had it not been for the ſaid Earles treaſons, they could neuer haue held it ſo long; but God was fully determined to bring the Duke to his end.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Burgundy being aduertiſed of the Duke of Lorrains arriuall, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his counſell contrary to his accuſtomed maner; for he was neuer woont to aske any mans aduiſe, but in all matters to follow his own ſenſe. Moſt of them counſelled him to retire to Pont-à-muſſon, being but fower leagues thence, &amp; to man the places well which he held about Nancy, alleaging that the Almains would depart ſo ſoone as they had victualed the towne, and the Duke of Lorrains mony faile him; ſo that he ſhould not be able in long time to aſſemble the like force. They ſaid further, that his enimies could not victuall the towne ſo well, but that before winter were halfe expired it ſhould be in as great diſtreſſe as at that preſent, and in the meane time, he might leuy men: for I haue been informed by thoſe that perfectly vnderſtood it that he had not in all his army aboue fower thouſand ſoldiers, of the which hardly twelue hundred were able to fight. Money he lacked not, for in the caſtell of Luxembourg being not far thence, were at the leaſt 450000. crownes, and men ynough he might haue recouered. But God would not giue him grace to follow this wiſe aduiſe, nor perceiue how many enimies lodged round about him on euery ſide: ſo that he tooke the woorſt courſe, and by the aduiſe of certaine harebrained fooles determined to hazard the battell with theſe few terrified and hartleſſe men; notwithſtanding all the reaſons alleaged to him, both of the great force of Almains the Duke of Lorraine had, and alſo of the Kings army that lay hard by his campe. When the Earle of Campobache was come to the Duke of Lorraine, the Almains commanded him to depart, ſaying, that they would haue no traitor among them. Wherefore he retired to Condé a caſtell and paſſage neere at hand <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP8.NOTE2">

But this practiſe with the Duke of Lorraine was not his greateſt treaſon; for a little
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7649:96"/>
before his departure he conſpired with diuers in the Dukes army, reſoluing with them (bicauſe he ſawe no hope of killing or taking his Maſter priſoner) to reuolt to the enimies at the very inſtant that the two battels ſhould ioine; but ſooner not to depart, to the end their ſudden reuolt might the more aſtoniſh and terrify the Dukes whole army. Further, he promiſed aſſuredly, if the Duke fled that he ſhould neuer eſcape aliue; for he would leaue thirteene or fowerteene truſty fellows behinde him, ſome to begin to flie at the very inſtant that the Almains ſhould march: and other ſome to haue an eie on the Duke to kill him if he fled, which enterpriſe he made full account to execute; and two or three I knew afterwards my ſelfe of thoſe that were left behinde for that purpoſe. After he had conſpired theſe abhominable treaſons, he returned againe to the Dukes campe, and then reuolted from him (as you haue heard) when he ſaw the Almains march, of whom being refuſed, he retired as I ſaid before to this caſtell of Condy. The ſaid Almains marched forward, being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with great force of French horſe men that had leaue giuen them to be at the battell. Diuers alſo there were that lay in ambuſhes neere to the place, to the end if the D. were diſcomfited they might get ſom good priſoner or booty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus you ſee the miſerable eſtate this poore Duke of Burgundy was fallen into, by refuſing good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe.

               <head>A diſcourſe vpon certaine vertues of the Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie, and of the time his houſe flouriſhed in proſperitie. Chap. 9.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Saw at Milan ſince his death a ſignet that I haue often ſeene him weare at his breſt, which was a ring ſet with a camée, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing very curiouſly cut into it an iron to ſtrike fire <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP9.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>, wherein his armes were grauen. This ring was ſold at Milan for two ducats, and he that ſtole it from him was a falſe knaue, that had beene a groome of his chamber. Many a time haue I ſeene him made ready and vnready with great reuerence and ſolemnitie, and that by great perſonages. But now when death came, all theſe honors fleeted away, and both he and his houſe were deſtroied as you haue heard, in the ſelfeſame place where a little before he had conſented for couetouſnes to deliuer the Conſtable to death. I had knowen him in times paſt a mightie and honorable Prince; as much yea more eſteemed and ſought to of his neighbours, than any Prince in Chriſtendome. Further, in mine opinion the greateſt cauſe of Gods indignation againſt him, was for that he attributed all his good ſucceſſe, and all the great victories he obtained in this world, to his owne wiſedome and vertue; and not to God, as he ought to haue done. And vndoubtedly he was endued with many goodly vertues: for neuer was Prince more deſirous to entertaine noble men, and keepe them in good order than he. His liberalitie ſeemed not great <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP9.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>, bicauſe he made all men partakers thereof. Neuer Prince gaue audience more willingly to his ſeruants and ſubiects than he <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP9.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>. While I ſerued him he was not cruell, but grew maruellous cruel towards his end: which was a ſigne of ſhort life. In his apparell and all other kinde of furniture he was woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pompous, yea ſomwhat too exceſſiue. He receiued very honorably all ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors and ſtrangers, feaſting them ſumptuouſly, and entertaining them with great ſolemnitie. Couetous he was of glorie, which was the chiefe cauſe that made him mooue ſo many wars: for he deſired to imitate thoſe ancient Princes, whoſe fame continueth till this preſent. Laſtly, hardie he was and valiant, as any man that liued in his time: but all his great enterpriſes and attempts ended with himſelfe, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his owne loſſe and diſhonor; for the honor goeth euer with the victorie. Yet to ſay the truth, I wot not well whether God powred out greater indignation vpon him, or vpon his ſubiects: for he died in battell without any long griefe; but they ſithence his death neuer liued in peace, but in continual war; againſt the which they haue not been able to make reſiſtance, bicauſe of their owne ciuill troubles and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Yea and another thing that moſt greeueth them is, that they that now defend
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7649:97"/>
them are ſtrangers, who not long ſince were their enimies, namely the Almaines. To conclude, ſince the Dukes death neuer man bare them good will, no not they that defend them. Further, if a man conſider well their actions, it ſeemeth that their wits were as much troubled, as their Princes before his death: for they deſpiſed all good counſell, and ſought all meanes to hurt themſelues. In the which vale of miſery they are ſtill like to continue; or if happily they wade out of it for a ſeaſon, like they are to fall into it againe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I am of a certaine wiſe mans opinion of my acquaintance, that God giueth to ſubiects Princes, according as he will puniſh or chaſtiſe them; and likewiſe towards the Prince diſpoſeth the ſubiects harts, according as he will aduaunce or abaſe him: and euen ſo dealt he with the ſubiects of this houſe of Burgundie. For after three great, good and ſage Princes, who gouerned them the ſpace of 120. yeers or more, with great wiſedome and vertue, he gaue them in the end this D. <hi>Charles,</hi> who held them in continuall wars, trauell and charges, almoſt as much in winter as ſommer: ſo that a great number of rich wealthy men were either ſlaine in theſe wars, or ſtarued in priſon. Their great miſeries began before Nuz, and continued with the loſſe of three or fower battels, till the hower of the Dukes death; who in this laſt battell waſted and conſumed the whole force of his countrie, and loſt all his ſeruants that could or would haue defended the eſtate and honor of his houſe. It ſeemeth therefore (as before I ſaid) that this aduerſity hath counteruailed all the time of their felicitie. For as I ſay, that I haue ſeene him a great, mighty and honorable Prince: ſo may I ſay alſo of his ſubiects: for I haue trauelled the beſt part of Europe in mine opinion, yet ſaw I neuer countrey in my life of the like greatnes, no nor far greater, abound with ſuch wealth, riches, ſumptuous buildings, large expences, feaſts, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and all kinde of prodigality, as theſe countries of Burgundy did, during the time that I was there. And if thoſe that knew them not during the time that I ſpeake of, thinke my report too large: I am ſure others that knew them then as well as my ſelfe, will thinke it too little. But God with one blowe hath laid flat on the ground this ſumptuous building, I meane this mighty houſe that bred and maintained ſo many woorthy men; that was ſo greatly eſteemed both far and neere, and obtained greater victories, and liued in greater honor during the time it floriſhed than any other: which great felicity and grace of God towards them continued the ſpace of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty yeeres. During the which time all their neighbors ſuffered great afflictions, namely, Fraunce, England and Spaine, ſo far foorth that all theſe at one time or other haue come to craue helpe and ſuccor of this houſe of Burgundy, as you haue ſeene by experience, of the King our Maſter, who in his youth while his father King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth raigned, liued in Burgundy the ſpace of ſixe yeeres, with good Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> who louingly receiued him. As touching the Princes of England, I haue ſeene in the Duke of Burgundies court King <hi>Edvvards</hi> two brethren the Dukes of Clarence, and Gloceſter who afterward named himſelfe King <hi>Richard</hi> the third: and on the contrary ſide of the houſe of Lancaſter that tooke part with King <hi>Henry,</hi> I haue ſeene in maner all the noble men ſuing to this houſe of Burgundy for aide. To be ſhort, as I haue knowen this houſe honored of all men: ſo haue I alſo ſeene it at one inſtant fall downe topſie turuy, and become the moſt deſolate and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable houſe in the world, both in reſpect of the Prince and alſo of the ſubiects. Such like works hath God brought to paſſe before we were borne, and wil alſo when we are dead. For this we ought certainly to beleeue, that the good or euill ſucceſſe of Princes dependeth wholy vpon his diuine ordinance.</p>

This newes at the firſt ſo rauiſhed the King with ioy, that he wiſt not what countenance to ſhew: notwithſtanding two doubts there were that troubled him; the one, leaſt the Almaines, if the Duke were taken, for greedines of monie (whereof the Duke had plentie) would not onely raunſome him, but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſome treatie with him, and of his foes become his friends. The other, if the Duke were eſcaped thus thriſe diſcomfited, whether he ſhould ſeaze into his hands his ſeniories of Burgundy or no, knowing them eaſie to be taken, bicauſe in manner all the force of the countrie was ſlaine in theſe three battels. Touching the which point, his reſolution (whereunto few I thinke but my ſelfe were priuy) was, if the Duke were eſcaped aliue, to command his army that lay in Champaigne and Barrois
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7649:98"/>
to enter incontinent into Burgundie during this great feare and aſtoniſhment of the people; and hauing ſeazed all the countrie into his hands, he meant to aduertiſe the Duke, that he did it onely to ſaue it for him, and defend it from the Almaines. For bicauſe the ſaid Duchie was held of the crowne, he would for no good that it ſhould be a pray for them: but whatſoeuer he had taken, he would faithfully reſtore; as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he would, though many happily will not credite it. And no maruell; for they know not the reaſons that would haue mooued him thereunto: but he altered this determination when he vnderſtood of the Dukes death. Immediately after the King (being at Tours) had receiued the letters aboue mentioned, which reported no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Dukes death; he ſent into the towne for all his captaines, and diuers noble men, to whom he read theſe letters; whereat they ſeemed in apparance greatly to reioice: but thoſe that looked narrowlier into their behauiour, perceiued that a great many of them forced their mirth, and wiſhed with all their harts, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their outward ſhew, that the world had gone otherwiſe with the Duke. The reaſon wherof peraduenture was, bicauſe the K. heretofore had liued in great feare; but now they doubted, ſeeing him deliuered of ſo many enimies, that he would alter many things, eſpecially offices and penſions. For there were a great number in the companie, that had borne armes againſt him both in the war called THE WEALE PVELIKE (whereof you haue heard in the beginning of this hiſtorie) and in diuers other broiles betweene him and the Duke of Guienne his brother. After he had communed a while with theſe noble men and captaines, he went to maſſe; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, he cauſed the table to be couered in his chamber, and made them all dine with him; the Lord Chauncellor, and certaine others of his counſell being alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. All dinner-while he talked of theſe affaires: but I and diuers others marked with what appetite thoſe that ſate at the table dined. And vndoubtedly there was not one of them (I wot not whether for ioy or ſorrow) that ate halfe a meales meate; yet were they not aſhamed to eate in the Kings preſence, for euery one of them had often before dined at his table. When the King was riſen from dinner, he withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and gaue to diuers, certaine of the Duke of Burgundies lands if he were dead, and ſoone after diſpatched the Admirall of Fraunce, called the baſtard of Bourbon and my ſelfe, giuing vs commiſſion to receiue into his allegeance as many as would become his ſubiects; and further: commanding vs to depart incontinent, and to open all courriers packets that we ſhould meet with, to the end we might be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed whether the Duke were dead or aliue. We departed in great haſte, though in the extreameſt colde weather that euer I felt: and when we had ridden about halfe a daies iourney, we met with a Poſte, whom we commanded to deliuer vs his letters; the contents whereof were, that the Duke was found among the dead bodies <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP10.NOTE1">

At our arriual we fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the towns men in treaty with Monſeur <hi>de Torcy,</hi> whom they had loued of long time. But the ſoldiers and thoſe that had been the Dukes officers, treated with vs about the deliuery of the towne by a meſſenger whom we ſent thither before vs, ſo far foorth that vpon our promiſes they cauſed fower hundred launces to depart the towne, which the townes men ſeeing, immediately opened the gates to Monſeur <hi>de Torcy,</hi> greatly to the hinderance of the captaines and the other officers of the towne; to ſeauen or eight of the which we had promiſed both money and penſions (for we had commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Kïng ſo to do) wherof nothing was performed bicauſe the towne was not yeelded by their meanes. This towne of Abbeuille was parcell of thoſe lands that King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeauenth engaged to Duke <hi>Philip</hi> of Burgundy at the treaty of Arras, vnder this condition, that for default of heire male they ſhould returne to the crowne. Wherefore it is not to be maruelled if ſo lightly they opened to vs their gates. From Abbeuille we rid to Dourlans, and ſent to ſommon Arras the chiefe towne of Artois, the ancient inheritance of the Earles of Flaunders, which hath alwaies deſcended as wel to the heires females as males. Monſeur <hi>de Rauaſtain</hi> and Monſeur <hi>de Cordes,</hi> who were within the towne condeſcended to come &amp; treat with vs at an abbey neere the towne called Mont Saint Eloy, bringing with them certaine of the towne. To the which treaty we agreed that I ſhould go and certain with me, for bicauſe we ſuppoſed they would not yeeld to our requeſts: it was thought good that the Admirall ſhould not go. Immediately after my arriuall at the place aſſigned, the Lords of Rauaſtaine and Cordes being accompanied with diuers gentlemen, and certaine alſo of the towne repaired thither. Among thoſe that came to negotiate with vs for the towne, was their Recorder, called Maſter <hi>Iohn de la Vaquerie,</hi> ſince that time chiefe preſident in the court Parlament at Paris. We required them at this meeting to open vs the gates and to receiue vs into the towne for the King, ſaying that he claimed both towne and countrey as his by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation; adding that if they refuſed ſo to do they were like to be forced thereunto, ſeeing both their Prince was ſlaine and their countrey vtterly vnfurniſhed of men of war, bicauſe of theſe three battels they had loſt. The Lords aboue named made vs anſwer by the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iohn de la Vaquerie,</hi> that this countie of Artois appertained of right to the Lady of Burgundie, daughter and heire to Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to hir by inheritance from the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> ſomtime Counteſſe of Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Artois, Burgundie, Neuers, and Retell, the which married with <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt, Duke of Burgundie, ſonne to King <hi>Iohn</hi> of Fraunce <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP11.NOTE1">

there, and to draw them to the Kings ſeruice: with ſome of the which I ſpake, who ſoone after became his faithfull ſeruants accordingly. Theſe countries were in marruellous feare and aſtoniſhment, and not without cauſe; for I thinke that in eight daies they could not haue leuied eight men of armes. Further, in all thoſe quarters were not aboue 1500. ſoldiers, horſemen and footmen, which lay towards Namur &amp; in Henault, &amp; were of thoſe that eſcaped out of the battel where the Duke was ſlain. Their woonted termes and maner of ſpeech were now cleane altered; for they ſpake lowly and humbly: which I write not to accuſe them, as though in times paſt their words had been more arrogant than became them; but the truth is when I was there they thought ſo well of themſelues, that they vſed not ſuch reuerent language, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the King, nor of the King, as they haue done ſithence. Wherefore if men were wiſe, they would vſe ſuch faire ſpeech in time of proſperitie, that in aduerſitie they ſhould not neede to change their termes. I returned to the Admirall, to make report of my negotiation: immediately whereupon we were aduertiſed that the King was at hand; for he ſet foorth ſoone after vs, and commanded letters to be written both in his owne name, and diuers of his ſeruants names, to cauſe certaine to repaire to him; by whoſe meanes he truſted to bring all theſe ſeniories vnder his obedience.</p>

In like maner all they of the houſe of Aniou were dead, namely King <hi>Rene</hi> of Sicilie, the Dukes of Calabria <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and their coſin the Earle of Maine, and afterward of Prouence: the Earle of Armignac was ſlaine at Leſtore, and all their lands and goods fallen to the King. But bicauſe this houſe of Burgundie was greater and mightier than the reſt, and had made ſharpe war with the Engliſh mens aide vpon his father K. <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth, thirtie two yeers without truce, and had their dominions bordring vpon his, and their ſubiects alwaies deſirous to make war vpon him and his realme: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reioiced more at their Princes death, than at the death of all the reſt. Further, he now fully perſwaded himſelfe, that during his life, no man neither within his realme, nor in the countries bordering vpon it, would once lift vp his finger againſt him. For he was in peace (as you haue heard) with the Engliſh men, the which he trauelled to the vttermoſt of his power to continue.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7649:99"/>
of this his enterpriſe being of ſo great importance. And ſure it appeereth both by that God ſhewed then and hath ſhewed ſince, that he meant ſharply to puniſh this houſe of Burgundy, as wel in the perſon of the Prince, as of the ſubiects, and of thoſe that liued amongſt them. For if the King our Maſter had taken the beſt courſe, the wars that haue conſumed them ſince had neuer hapned. For if he had done as he ought to haue done, he ſhould haue ſought to ioine to the crowne all thoſe great Seniories whereunto he could pretend no title, either by mariage or by courteous dealing with the ſubiects; which thing he might then eaſily haue accompliſhed, ſeeing the great feare, miſerie, and diſtreſſe theſe countries were in at that time. And if he had thus done, he ſhould both haue rid them of many troubles, &amp; inlarged and enriched his owne realme through long peace, which by this meanes had beene eaſily obtained. He might alſo heereby haue eaſed his realme diuers waies, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the charge of men of armes, who continually rode vp and down from one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the realme to another, oftentimes vpon ſmall occaſion. While the Duke of Burgundy yet liued, he eftſoones debated with me what were beſt to be done if the ſaid Duke hapned to die.

But this wiſe deliberation he began ſomwhat to alter the ſelfe ſame day he receiued newes therof, and the very inſtant that he diſpatched the Admirall and me.

Further he aſſured himſelfe of Peronne, which <hi>VVilliam</hi> of Biſche held, and was put in hope both by vs and others, that Monſeur <hi>de Cordes</hi> would reuolt to him.

But after dinner he withdrew himſelfe, and ſeemed to be diſcontented with the ſmall exploit the Admirall and I

Diuers others alſo he named, whom he had ſent to other great townes: and this matter he made Monſeur <hi>de Lude,</hi> and two or three others to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with me. It became not me to reaſon againſt him, nor gainſay his pleaſure; but I told him that I feared Maſter <hi>Oliuer</hi> and the others whom he named, would not ſo eaſily take theſe great townes, as they ſuppoſed. The King vſed this communication with me, bicauſe he had altered his minde, and hoped by reaſon of his good ſucceſſe in the beginning, that all the countrie would yeeld vnto him. Moreouer, he was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled by diuers (and was alſo of himſelfe inclined thereunto) vtterly to deſtroy this houſe of Burgundie, and to diſperſe the ſeniories therof among diuers men; ſome of the which he named, vpon whom he was purpoſed to beſtow the Earldoms, namely, Henault and Namur that border vpon Fraunce: with the greater ſeniories, as Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, Holland, and the reſt, he meant to win certaine Princes of Almaine to his friendſhip, to the end they might aide him in the atchieuing of his enterpriſe. All the which matters it pleaſed him to acquaint me with, bicauſe I had counſelled him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to take the other courſe aboue rehearſed: wherefore he would that I ſhould vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the reaſons, why he followed not mine aduiſe. Further he alleaged, that this courſe ſhould be moſt beneficiall for his realme, the which had ſuſtained infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite troubles, bicauſe of the greatnes of this houſe of Burgundie, and the mightie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories that it poſſeſſed. And ſure as touching the world, his reaſons carried great ſhew (though in conſcience me thought otherwiſe:) notwithſtanding ſuch was his wiſedome, that neither I nor any of his ſeruants could ſee ſo far into his affaires as himſelfe did; for vndoubtedly he was one of the wiſeſt and ſubtileſt Princes that liued in his time. But in ſuch waightie affaires God diſpoſeth the harts of Kings and great Princes, which he holdeth in his hands, and directeth them into thoſe waies that beſt ſerue for the executing of his determinations: for vndoubtedly if it had pleaſed him, that the King ſhould ſtill haue continued in that courſe, which he of himſelfe had deuiſed before the Dukes death; the wars that haue been ſince, and yet are, had neuer happened. But we were vnwoorthie on both ſides to enioy that quiet peace that was then offered vs, which ſure was the onely cauſe of the Kings error, not want of wit: for, as you haue heard, in wit no man excelled him. I write of theſe affaires at large, to ſhew that when a man attempteth any great enterpriſe, he ought at the firſt thoroughly to debate it, to the end he may chooſe the wiſeſt way; but eſpecially to ſubmit himſelfe to God, and humbly to beſeech him to direct him into the beſt courſe, which is the principall point, as appeereth both by the ſcriptures and by experience. I minde not heere to blame the King, nor ſay that he erred in this behalfe: for peraduenture diuers which knew and vnderſtood more than my ſelfe, were then and yet are of his opinion; notwithſtanding the matter was not debated there nor elſewhere. Further, thoſe that write Chronicles, frame their ſtile common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their commendation of whom they ſpeake, omitting diuers points, ſomtimes bicauſe they know not the truth of them. But as touching my ſelfe, I minde to write nothing but that is true, and which I my ſelfe either haue ſeen or learned of ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as are woorthie of credite, not regarding any mans commendation. For no Prince is to be thought ſo wiſe, but that he erreth ſomtime, yea oftentimes if he liue long, as ſhould well appeere by their actions, if they were alwaies truly reported.

When the King had repoſed himſelfe one day in this village neere to Peronne, he determined the next morning to make his entry into the towne; for it was yeelded him as you haue heard. And at his departure he drew me aſide, and commanded me to go into the countrey of Poictou and the frontiers of Britaine, telling me in mine eare that if neither Maſter <hi>Oliuers</hi> enterpriſe tooke effect, nor Monſeur <hi>de Cordes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted to him; he would cauſe all the countrey of Artois called La Leuée lying vpon the riuer of Lis, to be burned; and that done returne againe into Touraine. I deſired him to be good to certaine who by my means were become his ſeruants, and to whom I had promiſed in his name penſions and great rewards: whereupon he tooke their names of me in writing, and performed all that I had promiſed. Thus I tooke my leaue of him for that time. But euen as I was taking horſe, Monſeur <hi>de Lude</hi> came to me, whom the King for certaine conſiderations fauored greatly. He was a man much giuen to his owne priuate gaine, and as he cared not to deceiue and abuſe any man: ſo was he alſo very light of beliefe, and often beguiled himſelfe. He had been brought vp with the King from his childhood, &amp; knew which way to feed his humor, and had a very pleaſant head. He came and ſaid thus to me (wiſely after a ieſting maner) what depart you now when you ſhould be made or neuer, ſeeing the great things that fall daily into the Kings hands, wherewith he may enrich thoſe that he loueth? For my part I looke to be gouernor of Flaunders, and to make my ſelfe all of golde, in vttering the which words, he brake foorth into great laughter: but I had no luſt to laugh bicauſe I feared that this proceeded of the King. Mine anſwer was, that I would be right glad if his fortune might be ſuch, and that I truſted the King would not forget me.</p>
               <p>A certaine knight of Hainault was come to me not paſt halfe an hower before my departure, who brought me newes of diuers with whom I had peſwaded by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to put themſelues into the Kings ſeruice. The ſaid knight and I are kinſemen, and he is yet liuing, wherfore neither wil I name him, nor thoſe of whom he brought me this aduertiſement. His offer in few words was to yeeld vnto the King the chiefe places and townes in Hainault. Whereof I aduertiſed the King euen as I was taking my leaue; who after he had talked with the ſaid knight, told me that neither he nor thoſe others whom I named were ſuch as he had need of. He miſliked one for this point, and another for that, and their offer ſeemed vnto him nothing: for he thought to obtaine all that he deſired without them. Againe, after my departure the King made Monſeur <hi>de Lude</hi> to commune with the ſame knight, who was much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the ſaid <hi>de Ludes</hi> words, and departed incontinent without entring into farther treaty, bicauſe the ſaid <hi>de Lude</hi> and he would neuer haue agreed in any point. For whereas this knight was come out of Hainault to get ſomwhat at the Kings hands whereby to inrich himſelfe: the ſaid <hi>de Lude</hi> at the firſt meeting asked him what the townes would giue him to commend their cauſe to the King. I thinke verily that this refuſall the King made to theſe knights proceeded alſo of God; for ſince that time he would haue made good account of them if he could haue drawne them to his ſeruice. But peraduenture God would not accompliſh his deſire in all points either bicauſe of the reaſons aboue alleaged, or for that he would not ſuffer him to vſurpe this countrey of Hainault (which is held of the Empire) both bicauſe he had no title thereunto, and alſo bicauſe of the ancient league betweene the Emperors and the Kings of Fraunce, whereof the King himſelfe alſo ſeemed afterward to take notice.

But his hope was to raiſe ſome great tumult in this towne of Gaunt, which hath euer been inclined to rebellion, and was the eaſier to be mooued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto at this preſent, bicauſe vnder Duke <hi>Philip</hi> and Duke <hi>Charles</hi> they had liued in great awe, and loſt diuers priuileges by the treatie made with the ſaid Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> after their wars with him ended. Duke <hi>Charles</hi> alſo had taken one priuilege from them, concerning the election of their Senate, for an offence made the firſt day he entred into the towne as Duke: whereof bicauſe I haue made mention before, I will heere write no further. All theſe reaſons encouraged Maſter <hi>Oliuer</hi> the Kings barber to proceede in his enterpriſe, ſo far foorth that he diſcouered his purpoſe to ſome ſuch of the citizens, as he thought would giue eare vnto him, offering (beſides diuers other promiſes) to cauſe the King to reſtore them their priuileges that they had loſt. But notwithſtanding that he were not in their Towne-houſe to ſpeake publikely to their Senate, bicauſe he meant firſt to aſſay if he could do any good with this yoong Princeſſe; yet was his enterpriſe ſmelt out: wherefore after he had ſoiourned a few daies in Gaunt, he was ſent for to declare his meſſage; whereupon he repaired to the Princes preſence, being apparrelled much more ſumptuouſly than became one of his calling, and deliuered his letters. The ſaid Lady ſate in hir chaire of eſtate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing about hir the Duke of Cleues, and the biſhop of Liege, with diuers other noble men, and a great number of hir ſubiects. When ſhe had read hir letter, ſhe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to declare his meſſage. But he anſwered that he had nothing to ſay but to hir ſelfe alone. Whereupon it was told him, that this was not the maner of their countrie, eſpecially to commune in ſecret with this yoong Lady being vnmarried. But he ſtill continued his former anſwer, that he had nothing to ſay but to hir ſelfe apart. Whereupon they threatened to make him ſay ſomwhat elſe: which words put him in feare. And I thinke verily, that when he came to deliuer his letter, he had not bethought him what to ſay: for this was not his principal charge, as you haue heard. Thus Maſter <hi>Oliuer</hi> departed for this time without further ſpeech. Some of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7649:101"/>
Councell began to ſcorne him, as well bicauſe of his baſe eſtate, as of his fooliſh ſpeech and behauiour, but eſpecially they of Gaunt (in a little village neere where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was borne) ſcoffed and derided him, ſo far foorth that ſuddenly he fled thence, being aduertiſed if he ſtaide there any longer, that he ſhould be throwen into the riuer; which I thinke would haue prooued true. The ſaid Maſter <hi>Oliuer</hi> named himſelfe Earle of Melun, a little towne neere to Paris whereof he was captaine. From Gaunt he fled to Tournay, a towne in that countrie ſubiect to neither Prince, but maruellouſly affectioned to the King: for it is his after a ſort, and paieth him yeerely ſixe thouſand franks; but in all other reſpects liueth in libertie, and receiueth all ſorts of men: it is a goodly towne and a ſtrong, as all the inhabitants thereabout can te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. The churchmen and citizens haue al their poſſeſſions and reuenues in Henault and Flaunders, in both the which countries it is ſituate. Wherefore they vſed alwaies during the long wars betweene King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth and <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie, to pay yeerely vnto the ſaid Duke ten thouſand franks; the which ſumme I haue ſeene them pay alſo to Duke <hi>Charles:</hi> but at the time that Maſter <hi>Oliuer</hi> came thither, they were quit of all paiments, and liued in great wealth and quietnes. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Maſter <hi>Oliuers</hi> charge aboue mentioned were too waightie for him to deale in, yet was not he ſo much to be blamed, as they that committed it to him: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that his enterpriſe had ſuch ſucceſſe, as it was euer like to haue; yet ſhewed he himſelfe wiſe in that he afterward did. For perceiuing the ſaid towne of Tournay to be ſituate vpon the frontiers of both the countries aboue named, and very commodious to endammage them both, if he could put the Kings forces that lay in thoſe parts into it; and knowing further, that the townes men would neuer conſent thereunto, bicauſe they neuer tooke part with either Prince, but ſhewed themſelues friends indifferently to both: he ſent word ſecretly to Monſeur <hi>de Mouy</hi> (whoſe ſonne was bailife of the town, but not reſident there) that he ſhould bring his companie which he had within S. Quintins, and certaine other bands that lay in thoſe quarters, to the towne of Tournay; who at the hower appointed came to the gate, where he found Maſter <hi>Oliuer</hi> accompanied with thirtie or fortie perſons, who partly by fauor, and partly by force cauſed the gate to be opened, and receiued the Kings men; wherewith the people of the towne were well ynough contented, but not the gouernors: of whom Maſter <hi>Oliuer</hi> ſent ſeuen or eight to Paris, whence they departed not during the Kings life. After theſe men of armes, entred alſo diuers other ſoldiers, who did great harme afterward in the two countries aboue named: for they ſpoiled and burned many goodly villages and faire farms, more to the dammage of the inhabitants of Tournay, than of any other for the reaſons aboue alleaged. To be ſhort, ſo long they ſpoiled that the Flemmings aroſe, and tooke out of priſon the Duke of Guelderland (whom Duke <hi>Charles</hi> had held priſoner) and made him their captaine: and in this eſtate came before the towne of Tournay, where they lay not long, but fled in great diſorder; and loſt many of their men, and among the reſt the Duke of Gueldres, who had put himſelfe behinde to maintaine the skirmiſh (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euill followed) was there ſlaine, as afterward you ſhall heare more at large. Wherefore this honor and good ſucceſſe that happened to the King, and the great loſſe his enimies receiued, proceeded of the ſaid Maſter <hi>Oliuers</hi> wiſedome and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo that peraduenture a wiſer man, and a greater perſonage than he, might haue failed to atchieue the like enterpriſe. I haue ſpoken ynough of the great charge this ſage Prince committed to this meane perſon, vnfit to manage ſo waightie a cauſe; onely adding, that it ſeemed that God had troubled the Kings wits in this behalfe. For, as I ſaid before, if he had not thought this enterpriſe far eaſier than indeede it
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7649:102"/>
was; but had appeaſed his wrath, and laid downe his greedy deſire of reuenge vpon this houſe of Burgundy, vndoubtedly he had held at this day all thoſe Seniories vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſubiection.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard how Maſter <hi>VVilliam Biſche</hi> yeelded Peronne to the King. The ſaid <hi>Biſche</hi> was a man of baſe parentage, borne at Molins-Engibers in Niuernois; but inriched and greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced by Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of Burgundy, who made him captaine of Peronne, bicauſe his houſe called Clery (being a ſtrong and goodly caſtell that the ſaid <hi>Biſche</hi> had purchaſed) was neere vnto it. But to proceede, after the King had made his entry into the towne, certaine ambaſſadors came to him from the Lady of Burgundy, being all the greateſt and nobleſt perſonages that were able to do hir any ſeruice: which was vnaduiſedly done to ſend ſo many togither; but ſuch was their deſolation and feare, that they wiſt not well what to ſay or do. The aboue named ambaſſadors were theſe; the Chauncellor of Burgundy called Maſter <hi>VVilliam Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonet,</hi> a notable wiſe man, who had been in great credit with Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> and was highly adaunced by him. The Lord of Himbercourt (ſo often before mentioned in this hiſtory) was there alſo, (who was as wiſe a gentleman, and as able to manage a waighty cauſe as euer I knew any) togither with the Lord of la Vere, a great Lord in Zeland, and the Lord of Grutuſe, and diuers others as well noble men as church men, and burgeſſes of good townes. The King before he gaue them audience, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled both generally with them all, and apart with euery one of them to draw them to his ſeruice. They all gaue him humble and lowly words, as men in great feare. Notwithſtanding, thoſe that had their poſſeſſions far from his dominions in ſuch countries as they thought to be out of his reach, would not binde themſelues to him in any reſpect, vnleſſe the mariage betweene his ſonne the Daulphin and the ſaid Lady their Miſtres tooke effect. But the Chauncellor and the Lord of Himbercourt, who had liued long in great authority, wherein they ſtill deſired to continue; and had their lands lying neere to the Kings dominions; the one in the Duchy of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, the other in Picardy neere to Amiens: gaue eare to his offers, and promiſed both to ſerue him in furthering this mariage, and alſo wholy to become his the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage being accompliſhed: which courſe he liked not (though it were ſimply the beſt) but was diſpleaſed with them, for that they would not then abſolutely enter into his ſeruice. Notwithſtanding he ſhewed them no countenance of diſpleaſure bicauſe he would vſe their helpe as he might. Moreouer, the King hauing now good
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7649:102"/>
intelligence with Monſeur <hi>de Cordes</hi> captaine and gouernor of Arras, by his counſel and aduiſe required theſe ambaſſadors to cauſe the ſaid <hi>de Cordes</hi> to receiue his men into the city of Arras <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP15.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>: for at that time there were wals and trenches betweene the towne and the city, but the towne was then fortified againſt the city <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP15.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>; and now contrariwiſe the citie is fortified againſt the towne. After diuers perſwaſions vſed to the ſaid ambaſſadors, that this ſhould be the beſt and readieſt way to obtaine peace in ſhewing ſuch obedience to the King, they agreed to his demaund, eſpecially the Chauncellor and <hi>Himbercourt,</hi> and ſent a letter of diſcharge to the ſaid <hi>de Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> wherein they aduertiſed him of their conſent to the deliuerie of the citie of Arras. Into the which ſo ſoone as the King was entred, he raiſed bulworks of earth againſt the gates of the towne, and in diuers other places neere to the towne. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bicauſe of this diſcharge, Monſeur <hi>de Cordes</hi> and the men of war that were with him, departed out of the towne <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP15.NOTE3">

                  </ref>, and went whither them liſted, and ſerued where them beſt liked. And as touching the ſaid <hi>de Cordes,</hi> he now accounting himſelfe diſcharged of his Miſtres ſeruice, by the ambaſſadors letters aboue mentioned; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to do homage to the King, and to enter into his ſeruice; both bicauſe his houſe, name, and armes were on this ſide the riuer of Somme (for he was called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Philip</hi> of Creuecoeur, ſecond brother to the Lord of Creuecoeur:) and alſo bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the territories ſo often aboue mentioned, which the houſe of Burgundie had poſſeſſed vpon the ſaid riuer of Somme, during the liues of Duke <hi>Philip</hi> and Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> returned now without all controuerſie to the crowne. For by the conditions of the treatie of Arras, they were giuen to Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> and his heires males onely. Wherefore ſeeing Duke <hi>Charles</hi> left no iſſue but his daughter, the ſaid Maſter <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> of Creuecoeur became without all doubt the Kings ſubiect: ſo that he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no fault by entering into the Kings ſeruice, and reſtoring to him that which he held of him, vnleſſe he had done homage anew to the Lady of Burgundie. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding men haue reported, and will report diuerſly of him for this fact: wherefore I leaue the matter to other mens iudgements. True it is that he had beene brought vp, enriched, and aduaunced to great honor by Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> and that his mother for a certaine ſpace was gouerneſſe of the Lady of Burgundie in hir childhood: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the Duke of Burgundie died, he was gouernor of Picardie, Seneſchall of Ponthieu, Captaine of Contray, gouernor of Peronne, Montdidier and Roye, and Captaine of Bolloin and Hedin. All the which offices he holdeth yet at this preſent of the King; in ſuch maner and forme, as after the Dukes death the King our Maſter confirmed them vnto him.</p>
               <p>After the King had fortified the citie of Arras (as you haue heard) he departed thence to beſiege Hedin, leading thither with him the ſaid <hi>de Cordes,</hi> who had beene captaine of the place not paſt three daies before, and his men were yet within it, and made ſhew as though they would defend it for the Lady of Burgundie, ſaying; that they had ſworne to be true vnto hir: but after the artillerie had beaten it two or three daies they fell to parlament with the ſaid <hi>de Cordes</hi> their late captaine, and yeelded the towne to the King. But this was indeede a compact matter betweene the King and them. From thence the King went before Bolloin, where the like was alſo done: but they held, as I remember, a day longer than the others. This was a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enterpriſe if there had been ſoldiers in the countrie; and that the King knew well ynough, as he afterward told me: for diuers in Bolloin, perceiuing this to be a meere colluſion between the ſoldiers and him, trauelled to put men into the towne, if they could haue leuied them in time, and to haue defended it in good earneſt. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſpace of fiue or ſixe daies that the King lay before Bolloin, they of Arras
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7649:103"/>
perceiuing how they had beene abuſed, and conſidering in what danger they ſtood, being enuironed on euery ſide with a great number of ſoldiers, and great force of artillery: trauelled to leuy men to put into their town, and write thereabout to their neighbors of Liſle and Douay. At the ſaid towne of Douay was Monſeur <hi>de Vergy,</hi> and diuers others whoſe names I remember not, with a fewe horſemen eſcaped out of the battell of Nancy. Theſe determined to enter the towne of Arras, and leuied all the force they could, being to the number of two or three hundred horſe good and bad, and fiue or ſixe hundred footemen. But they of Douay (whoſe pecockes feathers were not yet all pulled) conſtrained them ſpite of their teeths to depart the towne at noone day, which was great folly, and ſo came of it. For the countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Arras is as plaine as a mans hand, and betweene Douay and Arras are about ſiue leagues. If they had taried till night (as they would if they might haue been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered) they had ſure accompliſhed their enterpriſe. But when they were vpon the way, they whom the King left in the city of Arras, namely Monſeur <hi>de Lude, Iohn de Fou,</hi> and the Marſhall of Loheacs companie being aduertiſed of their comming, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with all ſpeed to iſſue foorth and encounter them, and to put all in hazard rather then to ſuffer them to enter the towne: for they well perceiued that if they entered the towne, the city could not be defended. Their enterpriſe was verie dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, yet they executed it valiantly, and put to flight this band iſſued out of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay; the which alſo they ſo ſpeedily purſued, that they were all in a maner either ſlaine or taken, and amongſt the priſoners was Monſeur <hi>de Vergy</hi> himſelfe. The next day the King arriued there in perſon, reioicing much becauſe of this diſcomfiture, and cauſed all the priſoners to be brought before him, and of the footemen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a great number to be ſlaine, to put thereby thoſe few men of war yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in thoſe quarters, into the greater feare. Moreouer, Monſeur <hi>de Vergy</hi> he kept long in priſon, bicauſe he would by no meanes be brought to do him homage; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he lay in cloſe priſon &amp; in irons: But in the end hauing been priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a yeere and more, by his mothers perſwaſion he yeelded to the Kings pleaſure; wherein he did wiſely. For the King reſtored him to all his lands, and al thoſe he was in ſute for. He gaue him farther ten thouſand franks of yeerely reuenewes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other goodly offices. They which eſcaped out of this diſcomfiture, being verie fewe in number entred the towne, before the which the King brought his artillerie and laide his batterie. The artillery was goodly and great, and the batterie terrible; but the towne wall and the ditch nothing ſtrong: wherefore they within were in great feare, the rather bicauſe the town was vtterly vnfurniſhed of ſoldiers. Furher, Monſeur <hi>de Cordes</hi> had intelligence within it; &amp; to ſay the truth, the citie being in the Kings hands the towne could not be defended: wherefore they fell to parlament and yeelded it by compoſition, which notwithſtanding was euil obſerued; wherof Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeur <hi>de Lude</hi> was partly to blame. For diuers burgeſſes and honeſt men were ſlaine in the preſence of him and Maſter <hi>VVilliam de Ceriſay,</hi> who maruellouſly inriched themſelues there: for the ſaid <hi>de Lude</hi> told me that he got during the time of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there twenty thouſand crownes, and two timbers of Marterns. Moreouer, they of the towne lent the King 60000. crownes, which ſumme was much too great for their abilitie; but I thinke it was repaied them, for they of Cambray lent 40000. which I am ſure were reſtored, as I thinke were theſe alſo.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſame time the ſiege lay before Arras, the Ladie of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was at Gaunt in the hands of hir mutinous ſubiects greatly to hir loſſe; but to the Kings profit: for alwaies ones loſſe is an others gaine. Theſe citizens of Gaunt ſo ſoone as they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Duke <hi>Charles</hi> his death, thinking themſelues thereby cleerely deliuered out of captiuitie: apprehended their Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors being to the number of ſixe and twenty, and put them all or the greateſt part to death; pretending that they did it bicauſe the ſaid Senators the day before had commanded one to be beheaded, though not without deſert, yet without authority (as they ſaid,) their commiſſion being determined with the Dukes death, by whom they were choſen into that office. They ſlew alſo diuers honeſt men of the towne that had beene the Dukes freinds; amongſt whom were ſome, that when I ſerued him diſſwaded him in my preſence from deſtroying a great parte of the towne of Gaunt, which he was fullie reſolued to haue done. Further, they conſtrained their Princes to confirm al their ancient priuileges, both thoſe they loſt in the time of Duke <hi>Philip</hi> by the treatie of Gauures, &amp; thoſe alſo that Duke <hi>Charles</hi> tooke from them. The ſaid priuileges ſerued them onely for firebrands of rebellion againſt their Princes, whom aboue all things they deſire to ſee weake and feeble. Moreouer during their Princes minoritie, and before they begin to gouerne, they are maruellous tender ouer them; but when they are come to the gouernment they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with them, as appeereth by this Ladie whom they loued deerely and much tendered before hir comming to the ſtate. Further, you ſhall vnderſtand that if after the Dukes death theſe men of Gaunt had raiſed no troubles, but had ſought to defend the countrey: they might eaſily haue put men into Arras, and peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into Peronne; but they minded onely theſe domeſticall broiles. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding while the King laie before the towne of Arras, certaine ambaſſadors came to him from the three eſtates of the ſaid Ladies countries. For at Gaunt were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine deputies for the three eſtates, but they of the towne ordered all at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, bicauſe they held their Princeſſe in their hands. The King gaue theſe ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors audience, who among other things, ſaid: that they made no ouerture of peace;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7649:104"/>
but with conſent of their Princeſſe; who was determined in all matters to follow the aduiſe and counſell of the three eſtates of hir countrie. Further, they required the King to end his war in Burgundie and Artois, and to appoint a day when they might meete to treate friendly togither of peace; and in the meane time that he would cauſe a ſurceaſe of armes. The King had now in a maner obtained all he deſired, and hoped well of the reſt. For he was certainly informed, that moſt of the men of war in the countrie were dead and ſlaine, and knew well that a great manie others had forſaken the ſaid Ladies ſeruice, eſpeciallie Monſeur <hi>de Cordes,</hi> of whom he made great reckoning, and not without cauſe; for he could not haue taken by force in long time, that which by his intelligence he obtained in few daies, as before you haue heard: wherefore he made ſmall account of theſe ambaſſadors demaunds. Further, he perceiued theſe men of Gaunt to be ſuch ſeditious perſons, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to trouble the ſtate of their countrie, that his enimies by meanes thereof ſhould not be able to aduiſe, nor giue order how to reſiſt him. For of thoſe that were wiſe, and had been in credit with their former Princes, none were called to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating of any matter of ſtate, but perſecuted, and in danger of death: eſpecially the Burgundians whom they hated extremely, bicauſe of their great authoritie in times paſt. Moreouer, the King (who ſawe further into theſe affaires than any man in his realme) knew well what affection the citizens of Gaunt had euer borne to their Princes, and how much they deſired to ſee them affeebled; ſo that they in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie felt no ſmart thereof. Wherefore he thought it beſt to nouriſh their domeſticall contentions, and to ſet them further by the eares togither; which was ſoone done: for theſe whom he had to do with, were but beaſts; moſt part of them townes men vnacquainted with thoſe ſubtill practiſes, wherein he had been trained vp, and could vſe for his purpoſe, better than any man liuing.</p>
               <p>The King laide hold vpon theſe words of the ambaſſadors, that their Princeſſe would do nothing without the conſent and aduiſe of the three eſtates of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and anſwered that they were euill informed of hir pleaſure, and of certaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men about hir: for he knew very perfectly, that ſhe meant to gouerne all hir affaires by the aduiſe of certaine particular perſons, who deſired nothing leſſe than peace: and as touching them and their actions, he was well aſſured they ſhould be diſaduowed. Whereunto the ambaſſadors (being not a little mooued, as men vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with great affaires) made a hot anſwer, that they were well aſſured of that they ſaid, and would ſhew their inſtructions, if neede ſo required. Whereunto anſwer was made, that they ſhould ſee a letter, if it ſo pleaſed the King, written by parties woorthie of credit, wherein the King was aduertiſed, that the ſaid Lady would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne hir affaires by fower perſons onely. Whereunto the others replied, that they were ſure of the contrarie. Then the King commanded a letter to be brought foorth, which the Chauncellor of Burgundie, and the Lord of Himbercourt deliuered him at their laſt being with him at Peronne. The ſaid letter was written partly with the yoong Ladies owne hand; partly by the Dowager of Burgundie Duke <hi>Charles</hi> his widow, and ſiſter to King <hi>Edward</hi> of England; and partly by the Lord of Rauaſtain brother to the Duke of Cleues, and the ſaid yoong Ladies neereſt kinſman: ſo that it was written with three ſeuerall hands, but ſigned with the name of the yoong Lady alone; for the other twaine ſet to their hands onely to giue it the greater credit. The contents of the letter were, to deſire the King to giue credit to thoſe things, whereof the Chauncellor and <hi>Himbercourt</hi> ſhould aduertiſe him. And further, it was therein ſignified vnto him, that ſhe was reſolued to gouerne all hir affaires by fower perſons; namely, the Dowager hir mother in law, the Lord of Rauaſtain, &amp; the aboue named
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7649:104"/>
Chauncellor and <hi>Himbercourt,</hi> by whom onely and none others, ſhe humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to negotiate with hir; bicauſe vpon them ſhe would repoſe the whole gouernment of hir affaires.</p>
               <p>When theſe citizens of Gaunt, and the other ambaſſadors had ſeene this letter, it heated them throughly; and I warrant you thoſe that negotiated with them, failed not to blowe the fire. In the end the letter was deliuered them, and no other diſpatch of importance had they, neither paſſed they greatly of any other: for they thought onely vpon their domeſticall diuiſions, and how to make a new world, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer looking further into this buſines; notwithſtanding that the loſſe of Arras ought to haue greeued them much more than this letter: but they were townes men (as I ſaid before) vnacquainted with theſe affaires. They returned ſtraight to Gaunt where they found their Princeſſe accompanied with the Duke of Cleues, hir neereſt kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and of hir blood by his mother <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP16.NOTE1">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow to proceede in the hiſtorie. After theſe ambaſſadors were returned to Gaunt, the councel was aſſembled, and the Princeſſe ſate in hir chaire of eſtate, accompanied with all hir noble men, to giue them audience. Then the ambaſſadors made rehearſall of the commiſſion ſhe gaue them, touching principally that point that ſerued for their purpoſe, and ſaying that when they aduertiſed the King, that ſhe was determined to followe in all points the aduiſe and counſell of the three eſtates of hir countrey: he foorthwith anſwered that he was ſure of the contrarie, and bicauſe they auowed their ſaying, offered to ſhew the ſaid Ladies letters in that behalfe. The Princeſſe being therewith mooued, ſuddenly anſwered in the preſence of them all that it was not ſo, aſſuring hirſelfe that the King had not ſhewed hir letter. Then he that ſpake being Recorder of Gaunt or Brucels, drew the letter out of his boſome before the whole aſſemblie and deliuered it hir. Wherein he ſhewed himſelfe a lewde fellow and an vnciuill in diſhonoring openly after ſuch a ſort this yoong La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, who ought not ſo rudely to haue been delt with: for though ſhe had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an error; yet was it not publikely to be reformed. It is no maruell if ſhe were greatly aſhamed thereof; for ſhe had proteſted the contrarie to the whole worlde. The Dowager of Burgundie, the Lord of Rauaſtain, the Chauncellor, and the Lord of Himbercourt were all fower there preſent alſo.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Cleues and diuers others who had beene put in hope of this yoong Ladies marriage, ſtormed maruellouſly at this letter, &amp; then began their factions to breake foorth. The ſaid Duke was euer perſwaded heeretofore that <hi>Hymbercourt</hi> would further his ſute for his ſonne: but now perceiuing by this letter his hope to be fruſtrate, he became his mortall foe <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP17.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>. The Biſhop of Liege, and his minion Maſter <hi>VVilliam de la Marche</hi> who was there with him, loued him not for the things done at Liege, whereof the ſaid <hi>Hymbercourt</hi> had beene the chiefe inſtrument. The Earle of Saint Paule ſonne to the Conſtable of Fraunce, hated both him and the Chancellor; bicauſe they two deliuered his father at Peronne to the Kings ſeruants, as before you haue heard at large. They of Gaunt alſo hated them both, not for any offence made, but bicauſe of the great authoritie they had borne: whereof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they were as woorthie as any man that liued in their time, either heere or there; for they were euer true and faithfull ſeruants to their Maſter.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, the ſame day at night that this letter was ſhewed, the aboue named Chancellor and <hi>Hymbercourt</hi> through the furtherance as I am perſwaded of their enimies aboue named, were apprehended by the citizens of Gaunt, which danger
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7649:105"/>
notwithſtanding that they were forewarned of by their friends; yet had they not power to auoid, as it hath often happened to diuers others. With them was alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended M. <hi>VVilliam</hi> of Clugny then Biſhop of Therouenne, &amp; ſince of Poictiers; and all three impriſoned in one place. They of Gaunt proceeded againſt them by colour of proceſſe (contrarie to their accuſtomed maner in their reuenge) and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed certaine of their Senate to heare their cauſe: with whom they ioined in commiſſion one of this houſe of La Marche, deadly enimie to the ſaid <hi>Himbercourt.</hi> Firſt they demaunded of them, why they cauſed Monſeur <hi>de Cordes</hi> to deliuer the citie of Arras to the King, but thereupon they ſtood not long; notwithſtanding that they had nothing elſe iuſtly to charge them with. But this was not it that grieued them: for neither cared they to ſee their Prince affeebled by the loſſe of ſuch a towne; neither had they the wit to conſider what great damage might enſue thereof to themſelues in tract of time. Wherefore they reſted chiefly vpon two points <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP17.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>; the firſt, they charged them that they had receiued bribes of the towne of Gaunt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a ſute in law, which of late the ſaid towne had obtained by their ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the ſaid Chauncellor, againſt a particular man whom they had in ſute. But of all this matter of briberie, they acquited themſelues very honorably; and as concerning that particular point where they of Gaunt charged them, that they had ſold iuſtice, and taken monie of them to pronounce ſentence on their behalfe: they anſwered, that the towne of Gaunt obtained their ſute, bicauſe their cauſe was good; and as touching the monie they tooke, they neuer demanded it, nor cauſed it to be demanded, but receiued it being offered. The ſecond point was, that during the time they were with the late Duke <hi>Charles</hi> their Maſter, and alſo being his lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants in his abſence, they had done diuers things againſt the priuileges and ſtate of their towne, and that whoſoeuer doth againſt the priuileges of Gaunt, ought to die. But this point touched them no whit: for they were neither their ſubiects nor citizens, neither able to infringe their priuileges; and if the Duke or his father tooke any of their priuileges from them, they did it by the treatie made betweene them, after their long wars and diuiſions: but the others that were left them (being more than was requiſite for their profit) were neuer broken, but kept and obſerued. Well, notwithſtanding the anſwers theſe two notable men made to theſe two points (for of the principall matter firſt obiected againſt them, no word was ſpoken) yet the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the towne condemned them to die as they ſtood at the barre, bicauſe (as they ſaid) they had broken their priuileges, and receiued bribes after iudgement giuen vpon the matter in law aboue mentioned. Theſe two woorthie perſonages hearing this cruell ſentence, were not a little aſtoniſhed, and no maruell: for they ſaw no way how to eſcape, being in their enimies hands: notwithſtanding they appealed to the King and his court of Parlament, truſting by this meanes to delay their death, to the end their friends in the meane time might deuiſe ſome way to ſaue them. Before their arrainment, they racked them extremely againſt all order of law. Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe endured but ſixe daies, and (notwithſtanding their appeale) after ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, they gaue them but three howers reſpite to confeſſe them, and bethinke them of their ſoules health. Which time expired, they led them into their market place, and ſet them vpon a ſcaffold. The Ladie of Burgundie (afterward Ducheſſe of Auſtrich) being aduertiſed of their condemnation, went to the townehouſe to make requeſt and ſupplication for their liues: but perceiuing that ſhe could do no good there, ſhe went to the market place, where all the people were aſſembled togither in armes, and there ſaw the two noble men aboue named, ſtanding vpon the ſcaffold. The ſaid Lady was in hir mourning apparell, hauing nothing on hir head but a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7649:106"/>
kerchiefe, which was an humble and ſimple attire) and ought of right to haue moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to pitie. There ſhe deſired the people with weeping eies, and hir haire looſe about hir ſhoulders, to haue pitie vpon theſe hir two ſeruants, and to reſtore them vnto hir. A great part of the people were willing that hir pleaſure ſhould be done, and that they ſhould not die; but others would in no wiſe giue eare vnto hir: whereupon they bent their pikes the one againſt the other. But thoſe that deſired their death were the ſtronger, and cried to them that ſtood vpon the ſcaffold to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch them; immediately whereupon both their heads were ſtriken off: and in this eſtate returned this poore Lady to hir court ſorrowfull and comfortleſſe; for theſe two were the principall perſons, in whom ſhe had repoſed hir whole confidence. After they of Gaunt had done this exploit, they remooued from about the ſaid Lady, the Lord of Rauaſtain, and the Dowager Duke <hi>Charles</hi> widow hir mother in law, bicauſe they had alſo written part of the letter aboue mentioned, which <hi>Himber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> and the Chauncellor deliuered to the King, and they of Gaunt redeliuered to their Princeſſe after their returne, as before you haue heard. Further, they vſurped all power and authoritie ouer this poore yoong Lady: for ſo might ſhe now well be called, both bicauſe of the great dammage ſhe had already receiued by the loſſe of ſo many notable townes, irrecouerable by force, conſidering his power in whoſe hands they were, although by fauor, friendſhip, or compoſition ſome hope yet remained; and alſo bicauſe ſhe was in the hands of the ancient enimies and perſecutors of hir houſe, which was a great misfortune to hir. Notwithſtanding theſe citizens of Gaunt in all their publike actions haue euer ſhewed more groſſe folly than cunning, and no maruell: for they that carrie credit and authoritie among them, are for the moſt part, wealthie men of occupation, vnacquainted with waightie affaires, and little vnderſtanding what belongeth to the gouernment of a ſtate. Their cunning conſiſteth but in two points; the one, that they ſtudie by all meanes poſſible how to weaken and impoueriſh their Prince: the other, that when they haue made a fault, and finde the partie offended too ſtrong for them, they craue pardon with greater humilitie, and buie peace with larger gifts than any people in the world; yea and know what inſtruments to worke by, and what perſons to labour for obtaining of peace, better than any towne that euer I knew.</p>
               <p>After they of Gaunt had taken by force the gouernment of their Princeſſe, put the two aboue mentioned to death, and remooued from about hir thoſe that miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them; they began euery where to place and diſplace officers at their pleaſure, and to baniſh and ſpoile all thoſe that had beſt ſerued this houſe of Burgundy, not regarding their good or euill deſert: but aboue all other men they hated the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians, eſpecially ſo far foorth that they baniſhed them all, and trauelled to make them the Kings ſeruants and ſubiects as much as the King himſelfe did, who ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited them thereunto by faire words, wiſe perſwaſions, large gifts and promiſes, and ſought alſo to conſtraine them by great force which he had in their countrey. Moreouer theſe men of Gaunt meaning to begin their gouernment with ſome caſe of noueltie, tooke out of priſon (as alreadie is mentioned) the Duke of Gueldres, who of long time by Duke <hi>Charles</hi> his commandement had been held priſoner for the cauſes aboue rehearſed, and him they made generall of an army which they among themſelues, namely the townes of Bruges, Gaunt, and Ypre, leuied and ſent to Tournay to ſet fire on the ſubburbes thereof, which was little for their Princeſſe profit. For 200. ſoldiers ſent in time to Arras or ten thouſand franks to haue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained men to put into it, when the ſiege came before it; would haue done both hir and them much more ſeruice than ten ſuch armies as this. For this army could do no
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7649:106"/>
good but fire a fewe houſes in a place, whereof the King made ſmall account: for he leuied neither taskes nor ſubſidies there, but their wit was not able to reach thus far. After the Duke of Gueldres was come before Tournay with this armie being to the number of twelue or fifteene thouſand men, verie well paid by the townes aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, he ſet fire on the ſuburbs. But within the towne were three or fower hundred men of armes which ſallied out and charged his men on the backe as they retired, &amp; incontinent put them to flight. But the D. himſelfe being a valiant Prince, turned againſt his enimies meaning to maintaine the skirmiſh, to the end his men might haue leaſure to retire: but being euil followed he was ouerthrowne and ſlaine, and a good number alſo of this people; yet was the Kings force that did this exploit verie ſmall. The Flemmings armie retired with this loſſe, for there was but one band of them defeated. The Ladie of Burgundy (as I haue heard) and hir friends reioiſed much at this newes; for the brute ran for a certaintie that they of Gaunt were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to compell hir by force to marrie this Duke of Gueldres, which willingly ſhe would neuer haue done for diuers reaſons aboue rehearſed.</p>

And to ſpeake generally of Almaine, there are ſo many ſtrong places there, ſo many men inclined to miſchiefe, to ſpoile, to rob, and that vſe force &amp; violence one againſt another vpon ſmall occaſions, that it is woonder to ſee: for a man that is able to maintaine but himſelfe and his ſeruant, will proclaime war againſt a great citie or a Duke, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour thereof he may the better rob and ſpoile: for he will haue ſome ſmall caſtell ſituate vpon a rocke to retire into, where he entertaineth twentie or thirtie horſemen, which run downe to rob and ſpoile the countrie at his commandement. Theſe men are very ſeldome puniſhed by the Princes of Almaine, bicauſe they vſe their helpe when they neede their ſeruice: but the townes, if they take any of them, puniſh them cruelly, and often beſiege and deſtroy their caſtels. Further, the ſaid townes haue ſoldiers alwaies in pay for their defence. Wherefore it ſeemeth that theſe Princes and townes of Almaine are preſerued, the one to force the other to that is right and good. And it is neceſſarie that ſuch diuiſions ſhould be not onely there, but through the whole world. I haue hitherto ſpoken but of Europe; for I am not well informed of Aſia and Affrike: yet we heare that they are diuided and make war one vpon another as we do, yea after a much beaſtlier ſort. For I know in this part of Afrike bordering vpon vs, diuers places where they ſell one another to the Chriſtians, as alſo well appeereth by the Portugales, who haue bought and daily do buie of them manie ſlaues. But I doubt how well we may vpbraid this to the Sarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens, ſith in ſome part of Chriſtendome they do the like: notwithſtanding thoſe countries are either vnder the Turks dominion, or next neighbors to him; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſome part of Greece.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth then that ſuch diuiſions are requiſite through the whole world, and that theſe pricks and ſtings before ſpoken of which God hath giuen euery eſtate, and in a maner euery particular perſon, are neceſſarie. And ſurely for mine owne opinion
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7649:107"/>
(ſpeaking as a man vnlearned, and one that will maintaine no opinion not to be maintained) I thinke they are neceſſarie indeed, eſpecially bicauſe of the beaſtlines of ſome Princes, and the wickednes of otherſome, who hauing wit and experience ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, do notwithſtanding abuſe it. For a Prince or any other man of what eſtate or condition ſoeuer he be, hauing power and authoritie where he dwelleth ouer the reſt, if he be learned &amp; haue ſeen and read much, is thereby either much amended or empaired, for much learning maketh the euill woorſe, and bettereth the good <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP18.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref>: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it is to be preſumed that learning rather amendeth a man than em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paireth him: for if men be but aſhamed of themſelues when they know they do euill, it ſufficeth either to keepe them altogither from doing euill <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP18.NOTE6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref>, or at the leaſt from doing ſo much euill as otherwiſe they would. For although they be not good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, yet ſhame wil cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make a ſhew of goodnes: wherof I haue ſeen diuers examples of great perſonages, whom learning oftentimes hath withdrawen from doing euil, ioined with the fear of Gods puniſhments, wherof they haue more vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding than ignorant men which neuer ſawe nor read any thing. Wherfore thoſe Princes that know not themſelues, but lacke wit, either bicauſe they haue been euill brought vp, or bicauſe nature hath graffed follie in them, can neuer vnderſtand how far the power and authoritie extendeth that God hath giuen them ouer their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. For they neuer read it themſelues, neither are informed by them that know it; nay few that vnderſtand it are admitted to their preſence; and if ſome one be, yet dare he not inſtruct them in it for feare of diſpleaſure; or if happily at any time he put them in minde thereof no man will abide him, at the leaſt he ſhall be accounted but a foole, paraduenture alſo it may be taken in euill part, and ſo turne him to diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But to proceede, it is manifeſt that neither naturall reaſon, neither knowledge, neither feare of God, neither loue towards our neighbor, is ſufficient to keepe vs from vſing violence againſt others, from withholding other mens goods, nor from rauiſhing by all meanes poſſible that which appartaineth to others. For if great Princes withhold townes and caſtels from their kinsfolkes or neighbors, none of theſe reaſons can mooue them to reſtore them: and after they haue giuen foorth ſome colour or forged ſome pretence to withhold them, all their ſubiects commend their proceedings, at the leaſt ſuch as are neere about them, and hunt after their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor. Of meane perſons that be at variance I ſpeake not, for they haue a ſuperior who ſomtimes doth iuſtice to the parties, at the leaſt he that hath a good cauſe, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it earneſtly, and defendeth it ſtoutly, and ſpendeth frankly, ſhall in proceſſe of time haue right, vnleſſe the Court, that is to ſay, the Princes authoritie vnder whom he liueth, be againſt him. Wherefore it appeereth moſt manifeſtly, that God is conſtrained and forced as it were of neceſſitie to ſhew many examples among vs, and to beate vs with many rods, bicauſe of our negligence, or rather wickednes: but in Princes eſpecially negligence and ignorance is very dangerous, and much to be lamented, bicauſe the good or euill gouernment of their Seniories dependeth wholy vpon them. For if a Prince being mighty and hauing a number of ſoldiers in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, by whoſe meanes he leuieth great ſums of money at his pleaſure, as well to pay them, as to ſpend in all kinde of wantonnes not neceſſary, will diminiſh none of this fooliſh and exceſſiue expences; further if all men ſeeke to flatter him, and no man dare ſhewe him what is good, either for feare of diſpleaſure, or bicauſe he knoweth it will not preuaile: who can redreſſe this inconuenience but God alone? True it is, that God talketh not to men now as in times paſt, neither are there Prophets now a daies by whoſe mouth he ſpeaketh: but his word is diſperſed through the whole world, and well inough knowne to all thoſe that will vnderſtand and know it; ſo that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7649:108"/>
no man can excuſe himſelfe by ignorance, at the leaſt none that haue had ſpace and time to liue &amp; are indued with natural wit. How ſhall thoſe Princes then eſcape that gouerne their Seniories after ſuch ſort, that by force they leuy what they liſt, and by tyrannie maintaine their authoritie, and hold their ſubiects in ſo great thraldome, that the leaſt commandement they giue toucheth life? Some puniſh vnder colour of iuſtice, and haue lawyers euer at hand ready in all points to execute their comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and to make a deadly ſinne of a veniall. If they haue not matter inough againſt a man, they finde meanes to delay the hearing of the cauſe, or the taking of the depoſitions to hold the partie ſtill in priſon, or to vndoo him by charges, waiting continually if any man will come to accuſe him that is thus held in priſon, and to whom they wiſh euill. If this way be not colourable inough, nor ſpeedy inough for their purpoſe, they deuiſe other readier waies alleaging that it was neceſſarie to do thus and thus for examples ſake, and make the caſe as hainous as pleaſeth them: with others that hold of them and be of ſome power, they go more plainly to worke, ſaying, thou doſt againſt thine allegeance thou oweſt me, thou diſobeieſt me, and ſo proceede by force to take from him that is his if they can, (if they do not, it is no thanke to them) cauſing him to liue in great trouble and vnquietnes. Their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors that be ſtrong and mighty they meddle not with; but if any be weake, he can reſt no where for them: for either they ſay that he hath aided their enimies, or they make their men of armes to liue in his countries, or buie quarrels to haue colour to aſſault him, or finde ſome occaſion to deſtroy him by aiding his neighbor againſt him, and lending him forces to inuade him. Such of their ſubiects as haue beene in authoritie, and ſerued well their predeceſſors, they put out of office bicauſe they liue too long, and place newe men in their roomes. The Church men they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comber and trouble about their benefices, to the ende they may thereby wring ſome thing from them to enrich ſome one of their darlings, at the ſute eftſoones of thoſe that haue not deſerued it, and at the requeſt of ſuch men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as at times can preuaile much with them. The nobilitie they hold in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall trauell and charge vnder colour of their wilfull wars, which they take in hand without the counſell or aduiſe of their eſtates, and of ſuch as they ought to make priuie thereunto before they attempt them: for theſe they be that ſpend both goods and liues in the wars: wherefore it is reaſon they ſhould vnderſtand the cauſe of them before they begun. Their ſubiects they poule in ſuch ſort that they leaue them nothing; for notwithſtanding that they pay them taskes and ſubſidies aboue their abilitie: yet ſeeke they not to redreſſe the diſorder of their men of armes, which liue continually vpon their people without paiement, dooing beſides infinite miſchiefes and iniuries as all the world knoweth. For they are not contented with ſuch cheere as they finde in the husband mans houſe and is ſet before them; but beat alſo the poore men, and conſtraine them to go foorth to buie them wine, bread, and victuals: and if the good man haue a faire wife or a daughter, he ſhall do wiſely to keepe hir out of their ſight. Notwithſtanding, ſeeing theſe men of armes are duly paied, this inconuenience might eaſily be redreſſed, and order giuen that their paie ſhould be made at euery two moneths ende at the furtheſt; ſo ſhould they not be able to alleage any pretence of their miſchieuous dooings vnder colour that they want paie: for the money is leuied, and at the yeeres ende there is not one penie ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. I ſpeake this for our realme which is more afflicted and plagued with theſe men of armes than any other countrey that I knowe. But none can redreſſe this matter but a wiſe Prince: other realmes bordering vpon vs haue other ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Wherefore to continue this diſcourſe, is there any King or Prince that hath
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7649:108"/>
power to leuy one penie vpon his ſubiects beſides his demaines, without leaue and conſent of thoſe that muſt paie it, vnleſſe it be by tyrannie and violence? A man will ſay that ſomtime the Prince can not tarie to aſſemble his eſtates, bicauſe it would require too long time. Whereunto I anſwer, that if he mooue a war offenſiue, there needeth no ſuch haſte: for he may haue leaſure inough at his owne pleaſure to make preparation. And further, he ſhall be much ſtronger and much more feared of his enimies, when he mooueth war with the conſent of his ſubiects than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Now as touching a war defenſiue, that cloud is ſeene long before the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt fall, eſpecially when it is forraine war; and in this caſe good ſubiects ought not to complaine, nor refuſe any thing that is laid vpon them. Notwithſtanding ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion cannot happen ſo ſuddenly, but that the Prince may haue leaſure at the leaſt to call togither certaine wiſe perſonages, to whom he may open the cauſes of the war, vſing no colluſion therein, neither ſeeking to maintaine a trifling war vpon no neceſſitie, thereby to haue ſome colour to leuy money. Money is alſo neceſſarie in time of peace to fortifie the frontiers for defence of thoſe that dwell vpon them, leaſt they be taken vnprouided; but this muſt be done meaſurably. In all theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the wiſedome of a ſage King ſufficeth; for if he be a iuſt Prince, he knoweth what he may do, and not do, both by Gods law and mans. To be ſhort, in mine opinion of all Seniories in the world that I know; the realme of England is the countrey where the common wealth is beſt gouerned, the people leaſt oppreſſed, and the feweſt buildings and houſes deſtroied in ciuill wars, and alwaies the lot of misfortune falleth vpon them that be authors of the war.</p>
               <p>Our King is the Prince in the whole world that hath leaſt cauſe to alleage that he hath priuileges to leuy what him liſteth vpon his ſubiects, conſidering that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor any other Prince hath power ſo to do. And thoſe that ſay he hath, do him no honor, neither make him to be eſteemed any whit the mightier Prince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but cauſe him to be hated and feared of his neighbors, who for nothing woulde liue vnder ſuch a gouernment. But if our King or thoſe that ſeeke to magnifie and extol him ſhould ſay, I haue ſo faithfull and obedient ſubiects that they deny me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I demand, and I am more feared, better obeied, and better ſerued of my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects than any other Prince liuing, they endure patiently whatſoeuer I lay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, and ſooneſt forget all charges paſt: This me thinke (yea I am ſure) were greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to the King than to ſay; I leuy what me liſteth, and haue priuileges ſo to do, which I will ſtoutly maintaine. King <hi>Charles</hi> the fift vſed no ſuch termes, neither did I euer heare ſuch language proceede from any King, but from diuers of their ſeruants, who thought they did their Maſters great ſeruice in vttring ſuch ſpeeches: but in mine opinion they misbehaued themſelues towards their Prince, and vſed ſuch language partly bicauſe they would ſeeme to be good ſeruants, and partly bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew not what they ſaid. But for a manifeſt proofe of the French mens loialty and obedience to their Prince, we neede alleage none other example than that we our ſelues haue ſeene of late by experience; when the three eſtates were aſſembled at Tours, after the death of our Maſter King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, which was in the yeere of our Lord 1483. A man might then haue thought that this good aſſembly was dangerous for the Kings eſtate; yea, and diuers there were of meane calling, and leſſe honeſty, that ſaid then and haue often ſaid ſince, that it is treaſon to make mention of aſſembling the eſtates, and a thing tending to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing of the Kings authority: but they themſelues are thoſe that worke treaſon againſt God, the King, and the common wealth; neither do any vſe theſe ſpeeches but either ſuch as are in authority without deſert and vnwoorthy thereof; or ſuch
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7649:109"/>
as are common tale-carriers, and accuſtomed to talke of trifling matters; or ſuch as feare great aſſemblies, leaſt their doings ſhould there be ripped vp and reprehended. At this aſſembly I now ſpeake of, all men of what eſtate ſoeuer they were, thought the realme much weakned and impoueriſhed, bicauſe it had paied by the ſpace of 20. yeeres or more great and exceſſiue ſubſidies; yea ſo great, that they ſurmounted yeerely by the ſumme almoſt of three millions of francks all ſubſidies that euer were leuied in Fraunce. For King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth leuied yeerely but eighteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand franks <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP18.NOTE7">
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref>: but King <hi>Levvis</hi> his ſonne leuied at his death ſeauen and fortie hundred thouſand <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP18.NOTE8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref>, beſides the charges of the artillerie and ſuch like expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And ſure it was a pitifull thing to behold the miſerable eſtate of the poore people. But one good propertie had the King our Maſter, that he hoorded vp no treaſure, he tooke all and ſpent all, and beſtowed more vpon fortification of towns and places for the defence of his realme, than all his predeceſſors ioined togither. He gaue alſo much to churches, but in ſome reſpects he had done better to haue giuen leſſe: for he tooke from the poore to giue to them that had no need. But there is no man perfect in the whole world.</p>
               <p>Well to proceed. Notwithſtanding that this realme were ſo impoueriſhed and oppreſſed diuers waies: did the people yet after the King our Maſters death raiſe any ſedition againſt the K. that now is? the nobilitie and commons tooke they armes againſt their yoong King? went they about to chuſe an other? ſought they to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe his authoritie, or to bridle him that he ſhould not vſe the authoritie of a King? I thinke no, and to ſay the truth how could they? though diuers glorious fooles ſaid they might. But his ſubiects did cleane contrarie; for they all repaired to him, as well the Princes, as the gentlemen and Burgeſſes of good townes: they all acknowledged him for their King, and did him homage and fealtie, and the Princes and nobilitie preſented their requeſts in writing, humbly kneeling vpon their keenes. Further, they choſe among themſelues a counſell of twelue men, and the King being but thirteen yeeres of age commanded vpon report of the ſaid counſell. Moreouer at this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie certaine ſupplications were made, and bils exhibited in the preſence of the King and his Counſell in great humilitie for the common wealth of the realme, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring all to the King and his Counſels pleaſure. They granted the King without any deniall all that was demanded, and all that was ſhewed in writing to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the maintenance of his eſtate. The ſumme the King demanded was two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and a halfe of franks, <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP18.NOTE9">
                     <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                  </ref> which was ynough and ynough againe, yea rather too much than too little without ſome extraordinarie accident. Further, the ſaid eſtates humbly required, that at two yeeres end they might aſſemble againe: ſaying, that if the King had not money ynough, they would giue him more at his pleaſure. They promiſed moreouer if he had wars, or that any enimie ſhould inuade him, to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their bodies, to ſpend their goods, &amp; not to refuſe any thing for his ſeruice. Are ſubiects that giue thus liberally to be choked with priuileges whereby the Prince may take what him liſteth? ſhall not the King do iuſtlier both before God and the world to leuie after this ſort, rather than by extraordinarie will? ſeeing no Prince, as I haue ſaid before, hath authoritie to command money but by grant; vnleſſe he will vſe tyrannie and incurre the danger of excommunication. But a number of Princes are verie beaſts, not knowing what is lawfull or vnlawfull for them to do in this behalfe. Subiects there are alſo that offend their Prince and refuſe to obeie him, and ſuccour him in time of neede: yea in ſtead of aiding him when he hath great affaires in hand contemne him and ſtir vp rebellion and ſedition againſt him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the allegeance that they owe him. When I ſay Kings or Princes, I meane
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7649:109"/>
either themſelues or ſuch as gouerne vnder them: &amp; when I ſay ſubiects, I mean ſuch ſubiects as haue preheminence &amp; beare ſwaie in the common wealth. The greateſt miſchiefes are wrought commonly by thoſe that are mightie, for the weake deſire peace &amp; quietnes. When I ſay mighty, I meane aſwell women as men, ſomtime &amp; in ſome places where they haue rule and authoritie, either bicauſe of their husbands affection towards them, or bicauſe they gouerne their affaires, or for that their Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories are their wiues inheritance.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould write of men of meane calling in this world, my diſcourſe would be too tedious. Wherefore it ſhall ſuffice to ſpeake of great eſtates, bicauſe in them the power and iuſtice of God is moſt apparant. For although two hundred thouſand miſhaps chaunce to a poore man, no man regardeth them: but attributeth them either to pouertie or euill looking to; as for example, if he be drowned or breake his necke, they ſay this chaunced bicauſe he was alone, ſo that hardly men will giue eare to it. But if ſome misfortune fall vpon a great citie it is otherwiſe talked of, yet not ſo much as when it chanceth to a Prince. What is the reaſon then that God ſheweth his iuſtice rather vpon Princes and great men, than vpon men of low degree? bicauſe meane and poore men finde ynowe in this world to puniſh them when they offend; yea oftentimes they are puniſhed without deſert, either for examples ſake, or for their goods, or peraduenture through the iudges fault: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time alſo they deſerue puniſhment, and then it is reaſon that iuſtice be done. But as touching great Princes or Princeſſes and their gouernors and counſellors: againe, as touching prouinces and townes, rebellious and diſobedient to their Princes and gouernors, who wil ſearch out their liues? Who wil informe the Iuſtice of their actions? What Iuſtice will take notice thereof? or who will puniſh their faults? I ſpeake of the euill not of the good, but few there are of thoſe. What is the cauſe then that mooueth both them and all others to commit theſe faults aboue rehearſed, and many mo (which for breuitie I ouerpaſſe) not regarding the power and iuſtice of God? I anſwer, that it is lacke of faith, and in thoſe that are ignorant lacke of wit and faith togither, but eſpecially of faith, which in mine opinion is the onely fountaine of all miſchiefes. I meane ſuch miſchiefes as fall vpon thoſe that complaine, that they are troden vnder foote, &amp; oppreſſed by thoſe that are mightier than they. For if men were fully perſwaded the paines of hell to be ſuch as indeede they are, and beleeued firmely (as we ought all to beleeue) that who ſo hath taken ought by violence, or poſſeſſeth ought that his father or grandfather tooke wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: ſhall neuer enter into the ioies of paradiſe, vnles he make full ſatisfaction and reſtitution of all that he withholdeth from his neighbor; (whether it be Duchies, Earldoms, townes, caſtels, mooueables, medowes, ponds, or mils, euery man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his eſtate) there is no man liuing, be he poore or rich, or of what eſtate and condition ſoeuer he be, that would withhold ought that is not his owne. No, if all men beleeued this firmely, it is not to be thought, that there is either Prince, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, or any other man through the whole world, what eſtate or condition ſoeuer he be of, be he high or low, ſpirituall or temporall, man or woman, that would wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly withhold any thing from his ſubiect or neighbor, wrongfully put any man to death, hold him in priſon, take from one to giue to enrich another, or ſeeke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure diſhoneſty to his kinsfolks and ſeruants for his wanton pleaſures, as for women, and ſuch like, which is the filthieſt attempt that may be made. No vndoubtedly we would neuer do as we do, if we had a ſtedfaſt faith, and beleeued that which God and his Church commandeth vs to beleeue, vnder paine of damnation: knowing our daies to be ſhort, and the paines of hell horrible and endleſſe. Wherefore we
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7649:110"/>
may conclude, that all miſchiefes proceede of want of faith. For example where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when a King or Prince is taken priſoner, and feareth to die in priſon, is there any thing in the world, be it neuer ſo deere vnto him, that he will refuſe to giue for his deliuerance? as appeereth by King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who being taken priſoner by the Prince of Wales at the battell of Poictiers, paied for his raunſome three millions of franks, and yeelded to the Engliſh men all Aquitaine (at the leaſt all that he held in his hands) with a number of other cities, townes and places; yea in a maner the thirde foote of his realme: whereby he brought his realme into ſuch pouertie, that manie yeeres after they vſed leather monie, with a little ſtud or naile of ſiluer in the middeſt thereof. And all this gaue he and his ſonne King <hi>Charles</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>VViſe,</hi> for his raunſome. And if they would haue giuen nothing, yet would not the Engliſh men haue put him to death, but his greateſt paine had beene impriſonment. But admit they had put him to death, yet had not that pain been ſo great by the hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part, as the leaſt paine in hell. Why gaue he then all this great raunſome aboue rehearſed, deſtroying his children and ſubiects? but onely bicauſe he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that which he ſaw and perceiued well, that he could not otherwiſe be deliuered. But peraduenture when he committed the fault, for the which this puniſhment fell vpon him, his children, and ſubiects: he beleeued not firmely, that the offence he made againſt God and his commandements, ſhould be puniſhed. Now to conclude, there is no Prince, or very few, that will reſtore one towne they withhold from their neighbor, for the loue of God, or to eſchew the paines of hell; and yet King <hi>Iohn</hi> gaue all this to deliuer his bodie out of priſon.</p>
               <p>I asked a queſtion before, who will ſearch out great mens faults, who will informe the Iuſtice of them, and who will be the Iuſtice to puniſh them? Whereunto I now anſwer, that the information ſhall be the lamentable crie and plaint of their ſubiects, whom they tyrannize and oppreſſe ſo many waies without any compaſſion, the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull lamentation of widowes and orphans, whoſe husbands and fathers they haue wrongfully put to death; by meanes whereof their wiues and children haue euer after liued in affliction and miſerie; and generally the complaints of all thoſe whom they haue perſecuted either in their perſons or goods. Theſe, I ſay, ſhall giue information againſt them by their great mourning, wailing, and pitious teares, and ſhall accuſe them before the Lord God, who will be the iuſt iudge thereof, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture will not delay the puniſhment till the world to come; but will alſo puniſh them in this world: which puniſhment proceedeth of lacke of faith, bicauſe they had not a firme and ſtedfaſt beleefe in Gods commandements.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore of neceſſitie confeſſe, that God is forced to ſhew ſuch tokens and examples, to the end both Princes themſelues and all the world may beleeue, that theſe puniſhments fall vpon them for their misbeleefe and ſinnes, and that God ſheweth his mightie power and iuſtice vpon them, bicauſe none other in this world but he, hath power ouer them. At the firſt happily they amend not their liues for Gods ſcourges, be they neuer ſo great and long. But no misfortune falleth vpon a Prince, vpon thoſe that gouerne his affaires, or vpon thoſe that rule great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalties, but the iſſue is hurtfull and dangerous to the ſubiects. When I ſay misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, I meane none but ſuch as cauſe the ſubiects to ſmart; for to fall from a horſe, to breake a leg, to be puniſhed with a ſharpe ague, are no misfortunes to a Prince, bicauſe he may be cured of them, and peraduenture they may do him good, and teach him wit: but I call theſe misfortunes, when God is ſo diſpleaſed with a Prince, that he will no longer ſuffer him to raigne, but ſhew his power and iuſtice vpon him. For then firſt he weakeneth his wits, which is a ſhrewd blowe for all thoſe that haue
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7649:110"/>
to do with him, he troubleth his houſe, and ſuffereth it to fall into diuiſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes: and the Prince himſelfe is ſo far in Gods diſgrace, that he flieth the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and companie of the wiſe, and aduaunceth none but yoong fooles, voide of wit, oppreſſors, flatterers, and ſuch as ſoothe him in all his ſayings. If he take one penie, they bid him take two; if he threaten a man, they bid hang him, and after that ſort in all other actions. Further, they giue him counſell in any wiſe to cauſe himſelfe to be feared, and they alſo behaue themſelues cruelly and proudly, truſting by this meanes to hold men in awe of them, as though authoritie were their inheritance. Thoſe whom ſuch Princes, by the aduiſe of theſe new Counſellors haue baniſhed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, hauing ſerued many yeeres, and being well acquainted and friended in their countrie, will ſtorme at this vſage, and for their ſakes their friends and well willers alſo; and peraduenture ſuch iniurie ſhall be offered them, that they ſhall be forced either to defend themſelues, or to flie to ſome Prince their neighbor, who perchance is enimy to him that baniſheth and chaſeth them, and ſo by inward diuiſion ſtangers ſhall enter into the land. Is any plague or miſerie ſo great, as wars betwixt friends and acquaintance? Is any malice ſo ranke and deadly? As touching forren enimies, when the ſubiects are linked togither they may eaſily make reſiſtance, bicauſe their enimies haue no intelligence nor acquaintance in the realme. Thinke you that an vnwiſe Prince being accompanied with fooles, can ſmell a far off how great a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe diuiſion among his ſubiects is? or beleeue that it can hurt him? or procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of God? he eateth and ſleepeth no whit the woorſe for it; he hath neither fewer horſes in his ſtable, nor fewerrobes in his wardrobe, but many mo compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For he allureth men vnto him by promiſes, and by parting among them the ſpoiles and offices of thoſe whom he hath baniſhed; he giueth alſo of his owne to win thereby fame and renowme: but when he ſhall leaſt thinke of it, God will raiſe vp an enimie againſt him whom peraduenture he neuer miſtruſted. Then will he waxe penſiue, and ſuſpect thoſe whom he hath iniuried, yea he will feare ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede owe him no euill will: yet notwithſtanding he will not haue his refuge to God in this extremitie, but ſeeke to redreſſe this inconuenience by force. Haue we not ſeene in our daies examples heerof euen among our next neighbors? Haue we not ſeene the late King of England <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth of that name, heire of the houſe of Yorke, vtterly deſtroy the houſe of Lancaſter, vnder the which both his father and he had liued many yeeres? Further, the ſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> hauing done homage to King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. being of the houſe of Lancaſter, did he not afterward hold him priſoner many yeeres in the tower of London, the chiefe citie of the realme, where in the end he was put to death?</p>
               <p>Haue we not alſo ſeene the Earle of Warwicke principall gouernor of all the ſaid King <hi>Edwards</hi> affaires, (after he had put to death all his enimies, eſpecially the Duke of Sommerſet) in the end become deadly enimy to his Maſter, giue his daughter in mariage to the Prince of Wales ſonne to King <hi>Henry,</hi> attempt to ſet vp againe the houſe of Lancaſter, paſſe with the ſaid Prince into England, diſcomfited in the field, and ſlaine both he, his brethren and kinsfolks, and diuers other noble men of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who in times paſt had done the like to their enimies? After all this, the children of theſe when the world turned, reuenged themſelues; and cauſed in like maner the others to die, which plagues we may be aſſured hapned not but by the wrath of God. But (as before I ſaid) the realme of England hath this ſpeciall grace aboue all other realmes and dominions, that in ciuill wars the people is not deſtroied, the towns be not burned nor razed, but the lot of fortune falleth vpon the ſoldiers, eſpecially the gentlemen whom the people enuy to too beyond reaſon: for nothing is perfect in

After King <hi>Edvvard</hi> was quiet in his realme and receiued yeerely out of Fraunce fifty thouſand crownes paid him in the tower of London, and was growen ſo rich, that richer he could not be, he died ſuddenly as it were of melancholy, bicauſe of our Kings mariage that now raigneth, with the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> the Duke of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriches daughter. For ſo ſoone as he was aduertiſed thereof he fell ſicke, and began then to perceiue how he had been abuſed touching the mariage of his daughter, whom he made to be named the Lady <hi>Daulphineſſe.</hi> Then alſo was the penſion which he receiued out of Fraunce taken from him, which he called tribute, although indeed it were neither the one nor the other, as before I haue declared <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP18.NOTE10">

                  </ref>. K. <hi>Edward</hi> left by his wife two goodly ſonnes, one Prince of Wales, the other D. of Yorke, and two daughters. The D. of Gloceſter his brother tooke vpon him the gouernment of his nephew the Prince of Wales, being about ten yeeres of age, and did homage to him as to his ſoueraigne Lord, and lead him to London pretending that he would there crowne him King, hoping by that meanes to get the other brother out of the Sanctuary at London, where he was with his mother, who began already to be iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his proceedings. To be ſhort, by meanes of the Biſhop of Bathe (who hauing been ſomtime of K. <hi>Edwards</hi> Councell, fell afterward into his diſgrace, and was put in priſon, and made to fine for his deliuerance,) the D. of Gloceſter executed this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, which you ſhall now heare. This Biſhop aduertiſed the Duke that K. <hi>Edvvard</hi> being in loue with a certaine Lady, promiſed hir mariage vpon condition that he might lie with hir, wherunto ſhe conſented, ſo far foorth that the ſaid Biſhop maried them togither, none being preſent but they two and he himſelfe. Which matter this Biſhop being a iolly courtier neuer diſcloſed during K. <hi>Edvvards</hi> life, but cauſed alſo the ſaid Lady to conceale it, ſo that it was kept ſecret. After this the ſaid King falling againe in loue, maried the daughter of an Engliſh knight, called the Lord <hi>Riuers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a widow, and mother of two ſonnes. But after K. <hi>Edvvards</hi> death, this Biſhop of Bathe reuealed this matter to the D. of Gloceſter, whereby he egged him forward not a little to the executing of his miſchieuous pretended enterpriſe. For the ſaid D. murthered his two nephewes, crowned himſelfe King by the name of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, proclaimed his brothers two daughters baſtards in open parlament, tooke from them their armes, and put to death all the faithull ſeruants of the late King his brother, at the leaſt as many as he could lay hands on. But this cruelty remained not long vnpuniſhed: for when the ſaid King <hi>Richard</hi> thought himſelfe ſafeſt, and liued in greater pride than any King of England did theſe hundred yeeres (hauing put to death the Duke of Buckingham, and hauing a great army in a readines) God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp an enimy againſt him of no force, I meane the Earle of Richmond then pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in Britaine, but now King of England, of the houſe of Lancaſter, though not <note place="margin">

The ſaid Earle told me a little before his departure out of this realme, that from the fift yeere of his age he had liued continually like a priſoner &amp; a baniſhed man. And indeed he had been fifteene yeeres or therabout priſoner in Britaine to Duke <hi>Frances</hi> that laſt died, into whoſe hands he fell by tempeſt of the ſea as he fled into Fraunce, accompanied with the Earle of Pembroke his vncle. I my ſelfe ſaw them when they arriued, for I was come of a meſſage to the D. at the ſame time. The Duke entreated them gently for priſoners, &amp; after King <hi>Edwards</hi> death lent the ſaid Earle great force of men, &amp; a great nauie; with the which he ſent him hauing intelligence with the Duke of Buckingham, (who for this cauſe was afterward put to death) to lande in England: but the winde was againſt him, and the ſeas ſo rough, that he was forced to returne to Diepe, and from thence by land into Britaine. From whence ſoone
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7649:111"/>
after he departed with his band into Fraunce without taking leaue of the Duke, partly bicauſe he feared to ouercharge the Duke; (for he had with him fiue hundred Engliſh men,) and partly bicauſe he doubted leſt the Duke would agree with King <hi>Richard</hi> to his preiudice: for he knew that King <hi>Richard</hi> practiſed with him to that ende. Soone after, the King that now is appointed three or fower thouſand men to waft him ouer onely, and deliuered thoſe that accompanied him a good ſumme of money and certaine peeces of artillerie: and thus paſſed he ouer in a ſhip of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie to land in Wales where he was borne. King <hi>Richard</hi> foorthwith marched againſt him; but a kinght of England called the Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> who was married to the Earles mother, ioined himſelfe with the Earle, and brought vnto him at the leaſt 26000. men <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP18.NOTE12">

                  </ref>. The battell was giuen, King <hi>Richard</hi> ſlaine, and the Earle crowned King in the field with the ſaid <hi>Richards</hi> crowne. Will you ſaie that this was fortune? No, no, it was the iudgement of God: and for further proofe thereof marke this alſo. Immediately after the King had murthered his two nephews, he loſt his wife, whom ſome ſay he murthered alſo. Further, he had but one onely ſonne, who died in like maner incontinent after this murther. This example would haue ſerued better heereafter when I ſhall ſpeake of King <hi>Edwards</hi> death; for he was yet liuing at the time my former Chapter treateth of: but I haue rehearſed it heere to continue my diſcourſe which I am fallen into. In like maner we haue ſeene of late the crowne of Spaine altered after the death of Dom <hi>Henry</hi> that laſt died. For the ſaid Dom <hi>Henry</hi> had to wife the King of Portugales ſiſter laſt deceaſed, by whom he had iſſue a goodly daughter, which notwithſtanding ſucceeded not hir father, but was put from the crowne vnder colour of adulterie committed by hir mother. But the matter ended not without great contention and war: for the King of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale tooke part with his neece, and diuers great Lords of Caſtile ioined with him: yet notwithſtanding the ſaid Dom <hi>Henries</hi> ſiſter, wife to the ſon of Dom <hi>Iohn</hi> King of Arragon, obtained the crowne and poſſeſſeth it yet at this day: and thus this partage was made in heauen as diuers others are. Further, you haue ſeene of late daies the King of Scotland and his ſonne being thirteene yeeres of age in battell, the one againſt the other: the ſonne and his faction preuailed, and the King was ſlaine vpon the place <ref target="#S5602.BK5.CHAP18.NOTE13">
                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                  </ref>. This King murthered his owne brother, and was charged with diuers other crimes, namely the death of his ſiſter and ſuch like. You ſee alſo the Duchy of Gueldres out of the right line, and haue heard what impietie the Duke laſt deceaſed vſed againſt his father. Diuers other examples I could rehearſe which ſhould manifeſtly appeere to be puniſhments and ſcourges of God, which ſcourges are the principall cauſe of wars, whereof inſue mortality and famine, all the which euils proceede of lacke of faith. Wherefore I conclude, conſidering the wickednes of men eſpecially of great men, who know not themſelues, neither beleeue that there is a God: that it is neceſſarie for euery Prince and gouernor, to haue an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary to keepe him in feare and humilitie, otherwiſe no man ſhould be able to liue vnder them or neere them.</p>

to quietnes and very greedy of his money: for the which cauſe he paid duly at London the penſion of fiftie thouſand crownes, which they called tribute. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaue yeerely ſixteene thouſand crownes to the ſaid Kings principall ſeruants, whoſe names were theſe: the Lord Chauncellor; the Maſter of the Rols who now is Chauncellor; the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> Lord great Chamberlaine, a man of ſingular wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vertue, and in great authority with his Maſter, and not without cauſe, for he euer ſerued him faithfully; Sir <hi>Thomas Montgomery;</hi> the Lord <hi>Hovvard,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Duke of Norfolke &amp; partaker with the wicked King <hi>Richard;</hi> the Maſter of the Horſe called Maſter <hi>Cheiny;</hi> Maſter <hi>Challenger,</hi> and the Marques Dorſet the Queene of Englands ſonne by hir firſt husband. Further, he gaue goodly preſents to all the ambaſſadors that came to him, were their meſſages neuer ſo ſharpe and bitter, and ſent them home with ſuch goodly words &amp; Princely rewards, that they returned well contented. And notwithſtanding that ſome of them vnderſtood that he did all this onely to win time, the better to atchieue his enterpriſe in the conqueſt of the Duke of Burgundies dominions: yet winked they at it bicauſe of the great riches they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued at his hands. To all theſe aboue named he gaue beſides their penſions many goodly preſents, ſo largely that the Lord <hi>Hovvard</hi> ouer and aboue his penſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of him in leſſe then two yeeres ſpace in money and plate fower and twentie thouſand crownes. To the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> alſo L. great Chamberlaine of England, he gaue at one time a preſent of plate to the value of ten thouſand marks. The acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of all which great perſonages are yet to be ſeene in the chamber of accounts at Paris, ſaue of the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> Lord great Chamberlaine of England, which is an high office, for there is neuer but one alone in it. This L. Chamberlaine was long labored before he would become the Kings penſioner, my ſelfe being the onely man that perſwaded him thereunto. For I wan him firſt to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Burgundies friendſhip during the time I ſerued him, who gaue him yeerly a penſion of a thouſand crownes; whereof when I had aduertiſed the King, he would in like maner that I ſhould be a meanes to make him his friend and penſioner: for in times paſt during Duke <hi>Charles</hi> his life, and after his death alſo in fauor of the Lady of Burgundy, he had alwaies beene the Kings extreme enimy, and trauelled once to perſwade the King of England to aide the ſaid Lady againſt the King our Maſter. I began this friendſhip by letters, and the King gaue him a penſion of two thouſand crownes, which was double the ſumme he receiued of the Duke. Further, the King ſent to him one of the ſtewards of his houſe called <hi>Peter Cleret,</hi> charging him to bring with him the ſaid Lord Chamberlains acquittance, to the end heereafter it might appeere that the great Chamberlaine, Chauncellor, Admirall, and Maſter of the Horſe of England, beſides diuers others, had beene the French Kings penſioners. The ſaid <hi>Peter Cleret</hi> was a wiſe fellow, and communed priuily alone with the Lord Chamberlaine at his lodging in London; where, after he had declared his meſſage from the King: he preſented him his two thouſand crownes in golde (for the King neuer gaue but gold to ſtrangers) which money when the Lord Chamberlaine had receiued, <hi>Peter Cleret</hi> humbly beſought him for his diſcharge, to giue him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance; wherein the ſaid Lord Chamberlaine made difficultie. Then <hi>Cleret</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to giue him onely a letter of three lines to the King to teſtifie the receit of the money, leaſt the King being a ſuſpitious Prince ſhould thinke that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted it to his owne vſe. Which reaſonable demand the Lord Chamberlaine hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, anſwered thus: Sir, you require but reaſon, but this gift proceedeth of the King your Maſters liberality not of my requeſt; if it pleaſe you that I ſhall receiue it put it heere into my ſleeue, and other letter or teſtimoniall get you none of me. For I
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7649:114"/>
will not for my part that any man ſhall ſay that the Lord great Chamberlaine of England hath beene penſioner to the French King; nor that my acquittances be found in his chamber of accounts. Whereunto the ſaid <hi>Cleret</hi> replied not, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted leauing the money behinde him; and at his returne made report thereof to the King, who was not a little diſpleaſed with him for that he brought no acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but as touching the ſaid Chamberlaine, he commended and eſteemed him more than all the King of Englands other ſeruants, and his penſion was euer after paied without acquittance.</p>
               <p>After this ſort liued the King with the Engliſh men. Notwithſtanding the King of England was oftentimes earneſtly preſſed by this yoong Princes for aide, and therefore ſent ambaſſadors often to negotiate with the King our Maſter about theſe affaires, deſiring him to grant hir either peace or truce. Now you ſhall vnderſtand that thoſe that were at the debating of theſe matters in England, eſpecially in their parlament, (which is an aſſembly of the three eſtates, where diuers wiſe men were preſent that ſmelt our diſſimulation a far off, and receiued no penſion of the King as the others did) were verie deſirous; and yet the commons of the realme more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that the King of England ſhould ſend aide without further delay to the ſaide Ladie: ſaying, that we heere did but abuſe them, and that the marriage ſhould neuer be accompliſhed: alleaging that at the treatie made at Picquigny betweene the two Kings, we had faithfully ſworne and promiſed that the King of Englands daughter whom they had already called the Ladie Daulphineſſe, ſhould be ſent for into Fraunce within a yeere; which terme was now long expired. But what reaſons ſoeuer the ſubiects made, the King would giue no eare thereunto, but alleaged diuers excuſes to the contrarie. And to ſay the truth, he was a verie corpulent man and much giuen to pleaſures, neither could his body endure the toile of the wars. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he had wound himſelfe out of great troubles and was loth to enter into them againe. The couetouſnes alſo of the 50000. crownes yeerly paid him in the tower of London qualified his minde. Beſides all this, his ambaſſadors that came hither were ſo courteouſly entertained and ſo well rewarded, that they departed euer well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; but they neuer receiued any reſolute anſwere: for the King ſought onely to protract the time euer ſaying, that ere it were long he would ſend to the King their Maſter certain noble men with ſuch aſſurance of thoſe matters he ſtood in doubt of, as he knew well would content him. According to the which promiſe, within three weekes or a moneth after theſe ambaſſadors departure, ſometime more, ſometime leſſe, (which was no ſmall delaie in ſuch a caſe) he vſed to ſend ambaſſadors to the K. of England: but at euery voiage ſundrie men, to the end that if the former had made any ouerture not performed, the latter might plaid ignorance therin. They alſo that were ſent, perſwaded ſo well the King of England that we meant nothing but good faith, that he lay ſtill, and neuer ſtirred: for both he and the Queen his wife ſo much deſired this marriage, that partly for this cauſe, and partly for the other reaſons aboue alleaged; he was content to winke at this war, which ſome of his Counſell tould him plainely to be verie preiudiciall to his realme. But he feared the breach of this marriage, bicauſe men began alreadie to ſcoffe at it in England, eſpecially ſuch as deſired rebellion and ciuill war. Now to diſcourſe a little vpon this point. You ſhall vnderſtand that the King our Maſter neuer meant to accompliſh this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, bicauſe there was no equalitie betweene the age of the two parties: for King <hi>Edwards</hi> daughter at this preſent Queene of England, was much elder than the Daulphin now raigning. But by theſe diſſimulations a moneth or two was gayned in running to and fro, by which meanes the King foded foorth his enimie one whole
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7649:114"/>
ſommer, wherein he might haue done him harme. For vndoubtedly if the King of England had not hoped vpon this marriage, he would neuer haue ſuffered the King to take the places bordering ſo neere vpon the Engliſh dominions, but haue ſought to defend them: and if at the beginning he had declared himſelfe for the Ladie of Burgundie, the King who was by nature timorous, and would put nothing in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, had neuer weakened this houſe of Burgundie as he hath. Thus much I write chiefly to ſhew how theſe affaires paſſed; and ſecondarily, to the end that if heerafter thoſe that haue to manage great affaires happen to reade this hiſtorie, they may thereby learne how to helpe themſelues in the like caſe: for be their wiſedome neuer ſo great, yet a ſmall aduertiſement doth good many times. True it is, that if this Lady of Burgundy would haue conſented to marrie the Lord <hi>Riuers</hi> the Queene of Englands brother, ſhe ſhould haue beene aided with great force: but this had been an vnequall match; for he was but a poore Earle, and ſhe one of the greateſt inheritors in hir time. Many practiſes were entertained betweene the Kings of Fraunce and England; and amongſt others the King offered him, that if he would ioine with him, and paſſe ouer in perſon into the Lady of Burgundies countries, he would be contented that the King of England ſhould hold the countrie of Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders without homage, and alſo the Duchie of Brabant: offering further, to conquer for him at his proper coſts and charges fower of the greateſt townes in Brabant, and to put them into the King of Englands hands, to wage him 10000. Engliſh men for fower moneths, to the end he might the better ſuſtaine the charge of the wars, and to lend him great ſtore of artillerie, and men and carriage to conuey it, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon it, with this condition, that the King of England ſhould conquer the countrie of Flaunders, during the time the King our Maſter inuaded on the other ſide. Whereunto the King of England made anſwer that the townes of Flaunders were ſtrong and great; and both that countrey, and alſo the countrey of Brabant hard to be kept if they were conquered: adding further, that this war liked not the Engliſh men bicauſe of their entercourſe with thoſe countries. But ſeeing it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the King to make him partaker of his conqueſt, if he would giue him certaine townes he had alreadie conquered in Picardie, as Bolloin and diuers other which he named; he would then be contented to declare himſelfe for him, and ſend men to ſerue him if he would pay them, which was a verie wiſe anſwer.</p>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7649:115"/>
away a great troupe with him. Others neceſſitie forced to ſhrinke from hir, bicauſe they dwelt either within the townes the King had already conquered, or neere vnto them. Some alſo put themſelues into his ſeruice to be enriched; for no Prince dealt ſo liberally with his men, as the King our Maſter did. Moreouer, ciuill diſſentions and factions among themſelues encreaſed daily in the great townes, eſpecially in Gaunt, which bare the greateſt ſway in the countrie, as you haue heard. For the Lady of Burgundie diuers marriages were mentioned; for all men were of opinion, that either ſhe muſt get hir a husband to defend that ſhe yet held, or marrie the Daulphin, thereby quietly to poſſeſſe all. Some deſired greatly that this marriage with the Daulphin might take effect, ſhe hir ſelfe eſpecially, before the King deliuered the letters aboue mentioned, ſent vnto him by hir Chauncellor and the Lord of Himbercourt: but others diſallowed of this marriage, both bicauſe of the ſaid Daulphins yoong age (for he was but nine yeeres olde) and alſo bicauſe of the marriage promiſed in England: and theſe labored for the Duke of Cleues ſonne. Others there were that trauelled for the Emperors ſonne <hi>Maximilian</hi> now King of Romans. The ſaid Lady had conceiued extreme hatred againſt the King for the deliuerie of the letters aboue mentioned, which was the onely cauſe of the two noble mens death, and of the diſhonor ſhe receiued when hir letters were openly redeliuered hir before the aſſemblie, whereof you haue heard. Further, the deliuerie of the ſaid letters ſeemed alſo to be the onely occaſion that mooued them of Gaunt to baniſh ſo many of hir ſeruants from hir, to remooue from about hir, hir mother in lawe and the Lord of Rauaſtaine, and to put hir women in ſuch feare, that they durſt not open a letter before they of Gaunt had ſeene it, nor commune with their Miſtres in hir eare. Wherefore ſhe began now to remooue from about hir the Biſhop of Liege, who was of the houſe of Bourbon, and an earneſt ſuter for hir marriage with the Daulphin, which ſure had been a very honorable match for hir, had not the ſaid Daulphin been ſo yoong, notwithſtanding the Biſhop had no regarde thereof. To be ſhort, the ſaid Biſhop departed to Liege, whereupon euery man gaue ouer that ſute. It had been hard to deale in this buſines to the contentation of all parties, and I thinke who ſo ſhould haue intermedled in it, ſhould haue had but ſmall thanke for his labour in the end: wherfore euery man forbare to ſpeake therin. Notwithſtanding before hir marriage was fully concluded, there was an aſſemblie held about it, wherat the Lady of Halleuin the Princeſſe of Burgundies principall woman was preſent, who ſaid (as I haue heard reported) that they had neede of a man not a child, and that hir Miſtres was a woman growen and able to beare children, which ſhould be the onely ſtay of the countrey. This opinion tooke place, notwithſtanding ſome blamed this Lady for ſpeaking thus frankly; but others commended hir, ſaying, that ſhe had ſpoken but of ſuch mariage as was moſt neceſſary for the eſtate of the countrey. There was now no more to do but to finde a fit man. And I thinke verily if it had ſo pleaſed the K. ſhe would willingly haue married the Lord of Angouleſme that now is <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP3.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>; ſo much deſired ſhe to continue hir alliance with the houſe of France. But God was minded to make another match wherof peraduenture the ſequel is yet vnknown. Notwithſtanding this, we are able to ſay by that is already paſt, that of the ſaid mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage many great wars haue ariſen both heere and there, which perchance had neuer happened if ſhe had married the Lord of Angouleſme: wheras by reaſon of this other match both the countries of Flaunders and Brabant haue ſuffered great afflictions. The Duke of Cleues was at Gaunt with the ſaid Lady, making friends there in hope to conclude a marriage betweene hir and his ſon: but ſhe had no fanſie therunto; for both ſhe &amp; thoſe that were about hir, miſliked much his ſons conditions. Wherfore
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7649:115"/>
ſome began to motion a marriage betweene hir and the Emperors ſonne now King of Romans, the which in times paſt had been ſo far foorth treated of betweene the Emperor and Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> that it was concluded betweene them two. Further, the Emperor had a letter written with the Ladies owne hand by hir fathers commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a ring ſet with a diamond. The contents of the which letter were, that according to the pleaſure of hir Lord and father, ſhe promiſed to the ſaid Duke of Auſtrich the Emperors ſonne, to accompliſh the marriage concluded betweene both their parents, in ſuch manner and forme as hir ſaid Lord and father ſhould appoint.</p>
               <p>From the Emperor came certaine ambaſſadors to the ſaid Lady being at Gaunt, who receiued letters at Bruxels commanding them to ſtay there, bicauſe Commſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners ſhould be ſent thither to treat with them, which was the Duke of Cleues do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who was loth of their comming, and ſought to ſend them home diſcontented. But the ſaid ambaſſadors paſſed foorth that notwithſtanding, for they had good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence in the Ladies court, eſpecially with the Dowager of Burgundy, who was remooued from the ſaid Lady, as you haue heard, bicauſe of the letter aboue menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. She aduertiſed them (as it was reported) that they ſhould not ſtay at Bruxels notwithſtanding theſe letters, inſtructing them further what they ſhould do at their comming to Gaunt, and aſſuring them that the ſaid Lady and diuers about hir were well diſpoſed to their ſute. The Emperors ambaſſadors followed hir aduiſe, and rid ſtraight to Gaunt, notwithſtanding the meſſage aboue mentioned. Wherewith the Duke of Cleues was not a little diſcontented, but he was not acquainted with the diſpoſition of the ſaid Lady and hir women. The Councell concluded that theſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors ſhould haue audience, &amp; their meſſage being heard: the Princeſſe ſhould bid them hartily welcome, &amp; tell them that ſhe would take aduiſe with hir Councel, which words being vttered, ſhe ſhould withdraw hirſelfe without farther communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Whereunto ſhe agreed. The ambaſſadors when audience was giuen them, preſented their letters and declared their meſſage, which was, that hir mariage had been concluded betweene the Emperour and the Duke of Burgundy hir father with hir conſent; as appeered both by hir letters written with hir owne hand which they there ſhewed, and alſo by the diamond which they ſaid ſhe had ſent and giuen in token of marriage. Moreouer, the ſaid ambaſſadors required hir on their Maſters behalfe, that it would pleaſe hir to accompliſh the ſaid marriage according to the will and promiſe both of hir ſaid Lord and father, and alſo of hirſelfe. Further, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring hir to declare before the aſſembly there preſent, whether ſhe had written the ſaid letter or not, and whether ſhe minded to performe hir promiſe. Whereunto the ſaid Ladie without further deliberation anſwered, that ſhe had ſent the ſaide diamond, and written the letter by the commandement of hir Lord and father, and would performe all that was conteined therein. Then the ambaſſadors gaue hir humble thanks, and returned with ioifull minds to their lodging. But the Duke of Cleues was highly diſpleaſed with this anſwer, being cleane contrary to hir councels reſolution, and told hir that ſhe had done vnaduiſedly. Whereunto ſhe anſwered that ſhe could do no otherwiſe bicauſe hir promiſe was paſt, which ſhe would not breake. Which words the Duke hearing, and knowing diuers about hir to be of the ſame opinion: determined ſoone after to returne home into his owne countrey and relinquiſh his ſute. Thus was this marriage concluded, for the accompliſhment whereof Duke <hi>Maximilian</hi> came to Colen, where certaine of the Ladies ſeruants met him, and brought him money, whereof I thinke they found him bare inough: for his father was the hardeſt man either Prince or priuate man that liued in his
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7649:116"/>
time. The ſaid Emperors ſon being accompanied with ſeuen or eight hundred horſe was conueied to Gaunt, where the marriage was accompliſhed, which at the firſt was more vnprofitable than profitable to the Ladies ſubiects; for the Almains in ſteed of bringing money with them, had money giuen them. Their number was not ſufficient to withſtand the Kings forces, and their conditions agreed not with hir ſubiects maners: for they had liued vnder rich Princes which gaue goodly offices, kept honorable and pompous houſes both in furniture and fare, and had ſumptuous apparell, both for themſelues and their ſeruants: but the Almains are of a cleane contrary diſpoſition, for they are rude fellowes and liue groſſely.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but that by ſage and wiſe aduiſe and by the ſpeciall grace of God, the law Salicke was ordained in Fraunce which barreth women from the crowne, to the end the realme fall not into the hands of a ſtrange Prince &amp; nation. For neither the French men nor any other people can eaſily digeſt the gouernment of a ſtranger. And to ſaie the truth there is no great ſeniorie but in the end the dominion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of remaineth to the naturall countrey men, as appeereth by the realme of Fraunce, a great part whereof the Engliſh men poſſeſſed the ſpace of fower hundred yeeres; and yet now hold nothing therein but Calice, and two little caſtels, the defence whereof coſteth them yeerely a great ſumme of monie: the reſt they loſt much ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than they wan; for they loſt more in a day, than they got in a yeere. The ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame appeereth alſo by the realme of Naples, the yle of Sicilie, and the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces poſſeſſed by the French men many yeeres, where now is no memoriall of their being there, ſaue onely their anceſtors graues. For notwithſtanding that men may away with a ſtrange Prince being wiſe, &amp; accompanied with a ſmall traine well diſpoſed; yet can they hardly digeſt a great number of ſtrangers: for if the Prince bring with him a great multitude, or ſend for great forces vpon occaſion of wars, quarrels will ariſe betweene them and the ſubiects of the countrie, bicauſe of the diuerſitie of their maners and conditions, and bicauſe they will not forbeare to offer the ſubiects wrong, and are not beloued as the naturall countrie men be: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience then happeneth eſpecially, when ſtrangers ſeeke to haue the higheſt offices and eſtates, and the gouernment of the affaires in the commonwelth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Prince that goeth into a ſtrange countrie, had neede to be wiſe and carefull in ſetting all things in good order: for if he lacke this vertue of prudence, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth eſpecially of the grace of God, whatſoeuer other good parts be in him, all is but loſt; and if he liue a mans age both he and thoſe that liue vnder him ſhall taſte of great troubles, eſpecially in his old age when his ſubiects and ſeruants deſpaire of amendment.</p>
               <p>After this marriage aboue rehearſed was accompliſhed, their affaires amended not, for the Princes were both very yoong, and Duke <hi>Maximilian</hi> for his part ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and of ſmall vnderſtanding, aſwell bicauſe of his yoong yeeres <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP3.NOTE2">

Laſtly, he wanted force ſufficient for any great exploit, ſo that for theſe cauſes theſe countries fell into great miſeries, wherein they yet remaine and are like to remaine. Sure it is a greeuous plague when a Prouince is forced to ſeeke a ſtrange Prince to gouerne it. Wherefore God hath ſhewed great grace to the realme of Fraunce by the lawe aboue mentioned, which barreth women from the crowne: for by ſuch marriages with ſtrangers a priuate houſe (I confeſſe) may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, but to a great realme ſuch as this, many inconueniences ſhould therof inſue. Soone after this marriage accompliſhed, or while they were treating thereof: the King wan the countrey of Artois. It ſufficeth me to rehearſe the ſubſtance of theſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7649:116"/>

Hir death was a great loſſe to hir ſubiects, for ſhe was a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and liberall Lady, welbeloued of hir people, &amp; more reuerenced and feared of them than hir husband; and no maruell, for ſhe was Lady of the land. She loued hir husband entirely well, and was well reported of all men. She died in the yeere 1482. The King held in Hainault the townes of Queſnoi-le Counte, and Bouchain, the which he reſtored againe, wherat diuers woondered, conſidering that he ſeamed not deſirous of peace, but rather to take all and leaue this houſe of Burgundy nothing. And ſure I thinke if he could eaſily haue diſperſed and giuen away all the Seniories therof, he would vtterly haue deſtroied it indeed. But two cauſes there were, as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards told me, that mooued him to render theſe places: the one, he ſaid that a King ought to make more account of places of force and defence within his owne realme where he is annointed and ſacred, than of thoſe that are out of his realme, as theſe two were.

                  </ref>, by the which title he yet poſſeſſeth it. He was a man of ſmall wiſdome, and little regarding his honor, and in ſuch friends men finde ſmall helpe. Further, he was one of thoſe Princes aboue mentioned that vnderſtand nothing of their owne affaires, further then it pleaſeth their ſeruants to acquaint them with, who are euer plagued for their beaſtlines in their age as this Duke <hi>Sigiſmunde</hi> was. For his ſeruants during theſe wars, made him take part with whom them liſted; ſo that for the moſt part he ioined with the King our Maſter againſt his nephew, and would haue giuen his inheritance being very large from his owne kindred to a ſtrange houſe: for he neuer had childe, notwithſtanding that he were twiſe married. But now within theſe three moneths by the perſwaſion of another faction of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, he hath conueied a preſent eſtate of his whole patrimony to the ſaid <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> his nephew King of Romaines, reſeruing to himſelf a penſion onely amounting to the third part of his reuenues, without any further power or authority in the countrey. But (as I haue heard) he hath often repented him thereof; and if I haue heard a lie, yet it is like inough to be true. Such is the end of all Princes that liue like beaſts, againſt whom I inueigh thus vehemently, bicauſe of the great office and charge that God hath giuen them in this world. Notwithſtanding thoſe that are bereft of their wits ought to be free from all reproch; but ſure thoſe that haue good wits and healthfull bodies, and yet employ their time in nothing but folly and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; are not to be moaned when any misfortune falleth vpon them: as on the other ſide thoſe that ſpend their time according to their age, ſomtime in wiſdome and councell, and ſomtime in honeſt' recreation, are greatly to be commended, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie be the ſubiects that liue vnder ſuch a Prince.</p>
               <p>This war in Burgundie endured long, bicauſe of the Swiſſers ſmall aide aboue mentioned; notwithſtanding the Kings force was much too ſtrong for them: beſides
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7649:117"/>
that the Burgundians lacked monie; for the which cauſe the garriſons that were in the ſtrong places turned by intelligence. Monſeur <hi>de Cran</hi> the Kings lieutenant there, laide the ſiege before Dolle the chiefe citie of the countie of Burgundie, the force within it being ſo ſmall that he deſpiſed it, which turned to his loſſe: for they ſalied foorth and aſſaulted him on a ſudden, and tooke part of his artillerie, and ſlue certaine of his men, which was a great diſhonor to him, and put him alſo into the Kings diſgrace; who being troubled with this accident determined to ſend a new gouernor into Burgundie, partly bicauſe of this misfortune, and partly bicauſe of the great pillings and pollings the ſaid <hi>de Cran</hi> had vſed in the countrie, which were in deede too exceſſiue.

Other exploit none was done that I haue heard of, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the report went, that the ſaid <hi>de Cran</hi> behaued himſelfe there very valiantly as touching his owne perſon. The King; as before I ſaid, determined for the reaſons aboue alleaged, to place a new gouernor in Burgundie, not diminiſhing any whit of the ſaid <hi>de Crans</hi> profits, offices, or eſtates, ſaue onely that he tooke from him all his men of armes, except halfe a doſen or a doſen archers, left to accompanie him home. This Monſeur <hi>de Cran</hi> was a very groſſe man, and willingly departed to his owne houſe, where he liued at eaſe. The King placed in his roome Maſter <hi>Charles</hi> of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe Lord of Chaumont a valiant, wiſe, and diligent gentleman. Moreouer, he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed to win all the Almaines that made war againſt him in Burgundie, to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, not ſo much to vſe their helpe, as thereby to conquer the eaſilier the reſt of the countrie. The King ſent alſo to the Swiſſers, whom he called the Lords of theſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine leagues, making them many goodly offers; for he promiſed a yeerely penſion of 20000. franks <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP4.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> to their townes, which be fower, Berne, Lucerne, Zurich, and I think Fribourg was the fourth. Their Cantons alſo, as I ſuppoſe, receiued part of this penſion, which be three villages ſituate in the mountains, namely Swiſſe, whereof the whole countrie is named; Soleurre, and Ondreual: other 20000. franks he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed yeerely to the ſaid Swiſſers gouernors, and to certaine particular men that ſhould further his affaires. Moreouer, he enrolled himſelfe one of their Burgeſſes, &amp; deſired to be their principall confederate, and to haue writings thereof; wherein though they made ſome difficultie at the firſt, bicauſe the Duke of Sauoy had euer been their chiefe confederate: yet in the end they granted him his demaunds, and promiſed to ſend continually to his ſeruice 6000. men vnder this condition, that their entertainment ſhould be monethly fower gildons and a halfe, which band continued in pay till the Kings death <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP4.NOTE6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref>. A poore Prince had not been able to do this, but ſure it turned greatly to the Kings profit, though in the end I thinke it will be their deſtruction. For now they flowe ſo with monie, eſpecially with gold (wherewith before they were vnacquainted) that they are readie to fall at variance among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, otherwiſe no man ſhould be able to annoy them. For their countrie is ſo poore, and ſo full of mountaines, and themſelues ſo good ſoldiers, that few woulde ſeeke to inuade them. After theſe treaties were ended, and all the Almaines in Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie woon to the Kings ſeruice, the Burgundians force was cleane broken. To be ſhort, after diuers new enterpriſes atchieued by the gouernor the Lord of Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, he beſieged Rochfort a caſtell neere to Dolle, defended by Maſter <hi>Claude de Vauldray,</hi> and yeelded by compoſition. Afterward he beſieged the towne of Dolle, from the ſiege whereof his predeceſſor in this office was raiſed (as before you haue heard) and tooke it by aſſault. The report was that ſome of theſe Almaines lately receiued into the Kings ſeruice, thought to haue entered the towne to defend it; but
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7649:118"/>
ſo many franke archers thronged in with them, not vnderſtanding their treaſon, but onely for deſire of gaine, that after they were once entred, they fell all to the ſpoile, and burned and deſtroied the towne. A few daies after the taking whereof, the gouernor beſieged Auſſonne a very ſtrong town, but he had good intelligence within it. And before he brought the ſiege thither, he writ to the King, deſiring that the offices of the towne might be beſtowed vpon certaine whom he named: which requeſt was foorthwith granted. Although I were not preſent at theſe actions, yet vnderſtood I of them, both by the reports made thereof to the King, and alſo by the letters written to him; the which oftentimes I my ſelfe peruſed to make anſwer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by his commandement. The force within Auſſonne was but ſmall, and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines had intelligence with the gouernor, by meanes whereof within fiue or ſixe daies the place was yeelded. Thus was all Burgundie conquered, ſaue three or fower caſtels ſituate vpon mountaines, namely Ieu, and certaine others, and the towne of Bezanſon which is imperiall, not ſubiect to the countie of Burgundie, but enuironed therewith; and therefore at the commandement of the Prince thereof. The gouernor entred into it for the King, and came foorth againe; they of the towne doing vnto him all ſuch ſeruices as they were accuſtomed in times paſt to do to the Princes of Burgundie. Thus was all Burgundie ſubdued by the gouernors great diligence, whereunto the King earneſtly preſſed him, doubting that he would leaue ſome place vnconquered, to the end his helpe might be needed there ſtill, and he not be called from thence to ſerue the King in ſome other place. For Burgundie is a fruitfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, whereof he diſpoſed as of his owne; ſo that both the Lord of Cran before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and this gouernor alſo, filled their bags wel there. The countrie remained quiet awhile vnder the gouernment of the ſaid Lord of Chaumont: notwithſtanding cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine places, namely Beaune, Verdun, and others <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP4.NOTE7">

The ſaid places aboue rehearſed were ſoone recouered by the wiſedome and conduct of the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and by his enimies lacke of conduct and good order. Whereby you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, what difference God of his goodnes hath ſet betweene man and man: for to that part which he meaneth to protect and defend, he giueth the wiſeſt men, and likewiſe wiſedome to thoſe that are in authoritie to imploy the wiſeſt. Further, he hath alwaies ſhewed and doth daily ſhew himſelfe in all things a defender and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of our Kings, not onely of our Maſter that dead is, but of the King like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe now raigning, notwithſtanding that ſomtime they taſte alſo of his ſcourges. They that loſt againe theſe townes thus reuolted, were force ſufficient to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them, if they had with ſpeede put themſelues into them: but through their negligence they gaue the gouernor leiſure to leuie men, which was great follie; for they knew well ynough his eſtate, conſidering the great fauor all the countrie bare them. Wherefore they ought to haue entred with ſpeed into Beaune, being a ſtrong towne, and of defence, as the others were not. The ſelfeſame day that the gouernor went to beſiege a little beggerly towne called Verdun, being well informed of the ſtate thereof: theſe Burgundians entered there, minding to put themſelues into Beaune. They were ſixe hundred choiſe men horſemen and footmen, partly Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, and partly of the countie of Ferrette, led by certaine expert gentlemen of Burgundie, of the which <hi>Simon</hi> of Quinchy was one. But they ſpent time at Verdun while they might haue entred into Beaune, which the gouernor could neuer haue recouered, if they had once been within it. But for lack of good counſell, they ſtaied a night too long in Verdun, where they were beſieged and taken by aſſault. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7649:118"/>
Beaune was alſo beſieged, and all that was loſt recouered, ſince the which time our enimies were neuer of any force in Burgundie.

Moreouer, they had but few Captaines, and their force was very ſmall: but the generall of the Popes and King <hi>Ferrand</hi> of Naples army was the Duke of Vrbin, a valiant and wiſe Prince, and a good captaine. In their campe were alſo the Lord <hi>Robert</hi> of Arimini, who ſince hath been a man of great eſtimation, the Lord

                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> of Peſaro, and diuers others that accompanied the King of Naples two ſonnes, the Duke of Calabria, and the Lord Dom <hi>Frederic,</hi> (who are al yet aliue;) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great number of other valiant ſoldiers. Thus they tooke all the places that they beſieged; but not ſo ſpeedily as we would haue done in Fraunce, bicauſe they vnderſtood not what appertained neither to the ſiege nor defence of a towne ſo well as we: but ſure as touching the leading of an army, &amp; giuing order both for victuals &amp; al other things neceſſary for a campe, they paſſe vs far. The fauor the King ſhewed the Florentines ſtood them in ſome ſtead, though not ſo much as I wiſhed; but I had no forces there to aide them with, ſaue onely my traine. I ſtaied at Florence and in their dominions about a yeere, altogither vpon their charge: they vſed me very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably, and till the laſt day my entertainment rather amended then impaired. Then the King called me home, and as I paſſed through Milan, I receiued homage for the Duchy of Genua of the Duke of Milan, called <hi>Iohn Galeas,</hi> at the leaſt of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe his mother, who did homage to me as the Kings deputie in hir ſonnes name. From thence I returned to the King our Maſter, who receiued me gratiouſly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me with his affaires more than euer before, and appointed me alſo to be his bedfellow, notwithſtanding that I were vnwoorthy of that honor, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others were fitter for that place than my ſelfe: but he was ſo wiſe that no man could faile to pleaſe him if he executed his commandements, without adding ought thereto of his owne braine.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T my returne the King our Maſter looked ſomwhat aged, and his body was diſpoſed to ſicknes, but his diſeaſe brake not foorth as yet. His affaires he gouerned with great wiſedome, and the war endured ſtill in Picardie, wherewith he was not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, as were his enimies alſo in the ſaid countrie: but they could not remedie it. The Duke of Auſtriche now King of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hauing the Flemmings this yeere at his deuotion, laid the ſiege before Therouenne: but Monſeur <hi>de Cordes</hi> the Kings lieutenant in Picardie, leuied all the forces the King had in that countrie, and the frontiers thereabout, to the number of eight thouſand franke archers, and went to ſuccour the place. Whom when the Duke of Auſtriche perceiued to approch, he leuied his ſiege, and marched againſt him: the two armies met at a place called Guinegate. The Duke had of Flemmings to the number of twenty thouſand or better, and certaine Almaines togither with three hundred Engliſh men, led by an Engliſh Knight that had ſerued <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Burgundie, called ſir <hi>Thomas Abrigan.</hi> The Kings horſemen being much ſtronger than their enimies, brake the Dukes horſemen, and purſued them and Maſter <hi>Philip</hi> of Rauaſtain their captaine as far as Ayre, whereupon the Duke ioined himſelfe with his footemen.

Some of the Dukes horſemen retired, vnder colour of defending the ſtrong places; but others fled in good earneſt. The Dukes footmen fled not, yet were they vpon the point ſo to do; but they had with them on foote two hundred valiant gentlemen their leaders, among whom were the Lord of Romont of the houſe of Sauoye, the Earle of Naſſaw, and diuers others yet liuing. The courage of theſe gentlemen ſtaied the footemen, which was a woonder, conſidering they ſaw their horſemen broken. The Kings franke archers fell to ſpoile the Dukes carriage, and the ſtraglers that followed it, as victuallers, and ſuch like: but certaine of the Dukes footmen ſet vpon them, diſcomfited them, and ſlue ſome of them. The Dukes loſſe was greater than ours; for more of his men were taken, and more ſlaine <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP6.NOTE2">

                  </ref>: but the honor of the field was his. And I thinke verily if he had returned to Therouenne, he had not found a man neither in it, nor in Arras; and it was greatly to his loſſe, that he durſt not attempt ſo to do. But in ſuch caſes men are not alwaies informed of the beſt: and to ſay the truth, great cauſe he had to feare that enterpriſe. I ſpeake of this battell but by hearſay; for I was not preſent at it: notwithſtanding to continue the order of my hiſtorie, ſomwhat I was forced to write thereof. I was with the King when theſe newes were brought him, which vndoubtedly nipped him at the verie hart; for he was not accuſtomed to loſe, but had ſuch ſucceſſe in all his attempts, that fortune ſeemed to be at his commandement, which vndoubtedly his wiſedome greatly furthered. For he would hazard nothing, neither feared any thing more than a battel; and as touching this now mentioned, it was fought without his knowledge. His armies he made ſo ſtrong, that few Princes were able to encounter them; he was better furniſhed of artillerie, than any King that euer raigned in Fraunce: he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alwaies to take places vpon a ſudden, eſpecially ſuch as he perceiued to be euill fortified; which after he had once gotten, he furniſhed ſo well both of men and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, that it was impoſſible for his enimies to recouer them. Further, if the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of any ſtrong place, or any other within it, would practiſe to yeeld it for monie, he was ſure of a copes mate, neither would he ſhrinke were the ſumme neuer ſo great that was demanded, but liberally giue it. He was afeard at the firſt when newes was brought him of this battell, ſuppoſing the truth had not been told him, but that his whole force had beene ouerthrowen, knowing, if it were ſo, all to be loſt that he had conquered ouer this houſe of Burgundie in thoſe parts, and the reſt in great danger: but when he vnderſtood the truth, he tooke the matter patiently, and was well ynough contented with Monſeur <hi>de Cordes.</hi> Notwithſtanding he purpoſed to giue order, that no more ſuch enterpriſes ſhould be attempted without his knowledge. From this day forward he reſolued to treate of peace with the Duke of Auſtriche, ſo that it might be wholy to his owne aduantage, and that he might thereby ſo bridle the ſaid Duke, by meanes of his owne proper ſubiects (whom he knew to be inclined to practiſe againſt their Prince) that he ſhould neuer be able to do him harme. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, he was very deſirous to redreſſe all diſorders in his realme, eſpecially the long delaies of proceſſes and ſutes in law: which thing the better to compas, he minded to bridle the Court of parlament, not by diminiſhing their number or authoritie, but many things were done there againſt his minde, for the which he hated it. He was alſo deſirous to reduce his whole realme to one cuſtome, and one kinde of waight and meaſure: and further, that all the lawes and cuſtoms ſhould be written in the French toong, in a faire booke to auoid the pillings and pollings of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors in law, which are more exceſſiue in this realme than in any other, as the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7649:120"/>
hath good cauſe to knowe. And vndoubtedly if God had ſpared him life and health fiue or ſixe yeeres longer, he would haue done much good in the realme, as great cauſe he had to do; for he had more oppreſſed it than euer had any of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors: but neither authoritie nor perſwaſions could haue woon him to vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den his people till it had come of himſelfe, as in his latter daies ſure it would if God had preſerued him from ſicknes. Wherefore it is requiſite to do good while a man hath leiſure, health, and vnderſtanding. The treatie the King deſired to make with the Duke and Ducheſſe of Auſtrich, and their dominions, was this: he meant by meanes of the citizens of Gaunt to treate of a marriage betweene the Daulphin his ſonne now our King, and the daughter of the ſaid Duke and Ducheſſe, vnder theſe conditions, that if the marriage were accompliſhed, they ſhould permit him quietly to enioy the counties of Burgundie, Auxerrois, Maſconnois, and Charolois; and he for his part would reſtore vnto them Artois, reſeruing onely to himſelfe the citie of Arras, in ſuch ſort as he had fortified it: for the towne was now nothing woorth, conſidering the fortification of the citie. For before the King tooke Arras, the towne was fortified with ditch and rampire againſt the citie; but now the citie was fortified againſt the towne, and held for the King by the Biſhop: wherein the King did contrarie to the Princes of this houſe of Burgundie. For they alwaies at the leaſt by the ſpace of theſe hundred yeeres, made Biſhop whom they liſted, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a captaine in the towne beſides: but the King to increaſe his authoritie did cleane contrarie, and cauſed alſo the towne wals to be beaten downe, and the citie to be fortified: ſo that now the citie ſhutteth vpon the towne, a great ditch being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both. Wherefore the King indeed offered nothing; for whoſo hath the citie, hath the towne at commandement. Of the Duchie of Burgundie, the countie of Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loin, the townes ſituate vpon the riuer of Somme, the territories of Peronne, Roye, &amp; Montdidier no mention was made. After theſe ouuertures were once ſet on foot, they of Gaunt furthered them to the vttermoſt of their power, and vſed very rudely the Duke and Ducheſſe his wife, as did alſo diuers other great townes of Flaunders and Brabant, which were fully bent to follow the proceedings of them of Gaunt, eſpecially Brucelles, which was growen ſo wealthie, bicauſe of the continuall reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that Duke <hi>Philip</hi> and Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of Burgundie had made there: (as did alſo at this preſent the Duke and Ducheſſe of Auſtriche) that the wealth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout this time in the yeere 1479. in the moneth of March truce was made betweene theſe two Princes. The King was verie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of peace eſpecially in thoſe parts, ſo that it might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither for his aduentage. For he began now to waxe old and ſickely; ſo far foorth that once being at dinner at Forges neere to Chinon, he was ſuddenly taken in all parts of his bodie and loſt his ſpeech: he was taken vp from the table and held to the fire, and the windowes ſhut; to the which notwithſtanding that he deſired to go, yet ſome of his freiends held him and would not ſuffer him ſo to do, meaning all for the beſt. This diſeaſe tooke him in the yeere of our Lord 1480. in the moneth of March: he laie altogither ſpeechleſſe, he knew no man, and his memorie was wholly taken away. At the which inſtant you (my Lord of Vienna) came thither, and ſerued him at that time in ſteed of a Phiſition: for you gaue him a gliſter, and cauſed the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes to be opened, and the aire to be let in; whereupon immediately he recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his ſpeech and his memorie after a ſort, and tooke horſe and returned to Forges: for this diſeaſe tooke him in a village a quarter of a league thence whither he went to heare maſſe. He was diligently tended &amp; made ſignes what he would haue done: among other things he deſired that the officiall of Tours might be called to ſhriue him, and made ſignes alſo that I ſhould be ſent for, for I was gone to Argenton be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten leagues thence: when I came, I found him at the table with Maſter <hi>Adam Fumee,</hi> (who ſometime had beene King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeauenths Phiſition, and was at that preſent Maſter of the requeſts,) and another Phiſition called Maſter <hi>Claude:</hi> he vnderſtood little what any man ſaide, notwithſtanding griefe he felt none, he ſpake plainely almoſt neuer a word, but made ſignes that I ſhould be in his chamber. I waited vpon him the ſpace of 15. daies <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP7.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> at his table, &amp; about his perſon as one of the groomes of his chamber, which I accounted great honor to me, and thought my ſelf in dutie bound ſo to do. After two daies he recouered his ſpeech &amp; his memorie after a ſort: and bicauſe he thought that no man vnderſtood him ſo well as my ſelfe, his pleaſure was that I ſhould alwaies be by him, and he confeſſed himſelfe to the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall in my preſence, otherwiſe they would neuer haue vnderſtood one an other. He had not much to ſay, for he was ſhriuen not long before, bicauſe the Kings of Fraunce vſe alwaies to confeſſe themſelues when they touch thoſe that be ſicke of the Kings euill, which he neuer failed to do once a weeke. If other Princes do not the like, they are to blame, for continually a great number are troubled with that diſeaſe. After he was ſomewhat recouered, he began to enquire who they were that held him by force from going to the windowes, whoſe names when he heard, foorthwith he baniſhed them the Court; ſo that they neuer came afterward to his preſence, &amp; ſome of them alſo he put out of office. From others, namely the Lord of Segre and <hi>Gilbert de Graſſe</hi> Lord of Champeroux he tooke nothing, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to depart. Many woondered at this toie, blaming him for ſo vſing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7649:121"/>
them, conſidering that all that they did was for the beſt, and they ſaid truth: but Princes imaginations are ſtrange, and a number are bold to prattle of them that vnderſtand them not. The King feared nothing ſo much as the diminiſhing of his authoritie being maruellous great, for the which cauſe he would not be diſobeied in any point. Further, he remembred that when King <hi>Charles</hi> his father fell into the diſeaſe whereof he died, he entred into ſuſpition that his ſeruants ſought to poiſon him at his ſonnes requeſt <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP7.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>: which phanſie ſanke ſo deepely into his head that he refuſed his meate. Wherefore it was concluded by the aduiſe of his Phiſitions, and of his chiefeſt and truſtieſt ſeruants, that he ſhould be forced to eate: the which was executed verie orderly and aduiſedly by thoſe that ſerued him, for cooliz was powred into his mouth, but ſoone after this force he died. The King our Maſter who had euer miſliked this ordering of his father, ſtomacked maruellouſly that he had been held thus perforce; but yet made ſhew of much greater diſpleaſure than indeed he had conceiued therof. The chiefe cauſe that mooued him ſo to do was feare, leaſt they ſhould Maſter him in all other things, eſpecially in the expedition of his waightie affaires, vnder colour of the imperfection of his wits.</p>
               <p>After he had dealt thus roughly with theſe aboue named, he inquired what his Councell had done during the time of his ſicknes, and what diſpatches they had made, whereof the Biſhop of Alby, his brother the gouernor of Burgundy, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall of Gié, and the Lord of Lude had the whole charge: for theſe were preſent when his ſicknes tooke him, and lodged all in two little chambers vnderneath him. Further, he would needs ſee the letters and packets that had been brought and came howerly. The principall whereof were ſhewed him, and I read them before him: he made a countenance as though he vnderſtood them, and tooke them into his hands, faining that he read them, notwithſtanding that indeed he vnderſtood neuer a word. Somtime alſo he ſpake a word or two, or made ſignes what ſhould be the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe letters; but little or no thing was diſpatched, for we expected an end of his diſeaſe, bicauſe he was a Maſter with whom it ſtood vs vpon to deale circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly. This ſicknes held him about fifteene daies, and then his wits and ſpeech he recouered perfectly, but his body was maruellous weake; for the which cauſe we feared greatly a relapſe, the rather bicauſe naturally he was inclined to giue but ſmal credit to Phiſitions. Immediately after he was well recouered, he reſtored Cardinall Ballue (whom he had held in priſon fowerteene yeeres) to liberty. Whereunto not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he had been required oftentimes before, both by the Sea Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and others, and all in vaine: yet now he purchaſed the abſolution of that fault himſelfe, by a bull ſent from our holy father the Pope by his owne procurement. When his diſeaſe firſt tooke him, they that at that preſent were about him held him for dead, and ſent foorth diuers commandements for the reuoking of an exceſſiue and cruell ſubſidie lately laid vpon his ſubiects, by the aduiſe of the Lord of Cordes his lieutenant in Picardy, wherewith were waged ten thouſand footemen, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in a readines, &amp; 2500. pioners, the which were called the <hi>Soldiers of the campe.</hi> Moreouer, he appointed fifteene hundred of his ordinary men of armes to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them, and to fight on foote when need ſo required. He cauſed alſo a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of cartes to be made to incloſe them, and tents and pauilions, imitating therein the D. of Burgundies campe. The charge of this army amounted yeerly to 1500000. franks <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP7.NOTE3">

                  </ref>. When theſe ſoldiers were in a readines, and furniſhed of all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, he went to ſee them muſter in a valley neere to Pont de l'Arche in Normandy, where the band of the ſixe thouſand Swiſſers aboue mentioned muſtered alſo, the which neuer ſawe the King but at this time onely. After all was ended, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7649:122"/>
to Tours, where he fell againe into his former diſeaſe, and loſt his ſpeech as before, and was by the ſpace of two houres in ſuch caſe that all men held him for dead. He lay in a gallery vpon a mattreſſe of ſtraw, diuers ſtanding about him. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeur <hi>de Bouchage</hi> and I vowed him to Saint Claude, and all the reſt that were preſent vowed him alſo. Immediately whereupon he recouered his ſpeech, and ſoone after aroſe and walked vp and downe the houſe, but his body was maruellous feeble. The ſecond fit of ſicknes tooke him in the yeere 1481. notwithſtanding he rode vp and downe the countrie as before, and went to Argenton to my houſe, where he lay a moneth maruellous ſicke. From thence he went to Tours, where (notwithſtanding that he ſtill remained ſicke) he tooke vpon him his voiage to Saint Claude, to whom as you haue heard he was vowed, and at his departure thence commanded me to go into Sauoye againſt the Lords of Chambre, Miolant, and Breſſe, bicauſe they had taken priſoner the Lord of Lins in Daulphine, whom he had appointed gouernor of Duke <hi>Philibert</hi> his nephew. Yet notwithſtanding couertly he aided theſe Lords againſt whom I went. He ſent alſo a great band of ſoldiers after me, whom I led to Maſcon againſt the Lord of Breſſe, but he and I agreed well ynough ſecretly. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Lord of Chambre made a compoſition with the Duke of Sauoye at Thurin in Piedmont where he lay, whereof he aduertiſed me; and immediately thereupon I cauſed my forces to retire. He led the ſaid Duke to Grenoble, whither the Marſhall of Burgundie, the Marqueſſe of Rothelin, and my ſelfe went to receiue him. The King commanded me to returne home, and to meete him at Beauieu in Beauiolois, where when I arriued, I woondered to ſee him ſo leane and bare, much more to ride vp and downe the countrie, but his noble hart carried him. At Beauieu he receiued letters, that the Ducheſſe of Auſtriche was dead of a fall from hir horſe; for ſhe rid a fierce hobby that threw hir vpon a blocke, notwithſtanding ſome ſay ſhe died not of the fall, but of an ague: but howſoeuer it were, ſhe died ſoone after the fall, to the great dammage of hir ſubiects &amp; friends, who ſince hir death neuer had quietnes nor good ſucceſſe. For this people of Gaunt and the other towns bare much more reuerence to hir than to hir husband, bicauſe ſhe was Lady of the country. She died in the yeer 1482. The K. told me theſe newes in great ioy, adding, that the two childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remained in the citizens of Gaunts cuſtodie, whom he knew to be inclined to ſedition &amp; rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt this houſe of Burgundie. Further, he thought the time now come when he might do ſome great exploit, ſeeing the D. of Auſtriche was but yoong, his father yet liuing, his countries troubled on euerie ſide with wars, and himſelfe a ſtranger and weakly accompanied. For the Emperor his father was too extremely couetous, for the which cauſe his ſonne found the leſſe fauour. The King immediately after the Ducheſſe death, began to practiſe with the gouernors of Gaunt, by meanes of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeur <hi>de Cordes,</hi> and to treate of a marriage betweene the Daulphin his ſonne, and the ſaid Dukes daughter called <hi>Margaret,</hi> at this preſent our Queene. The ſaid <hi>de Cordes</hi> addreſſed himſelfe wholy to two men, the one a penſioner of the towne called <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Riue,</hi> a ſubtill craftie fellow; the other the clarke of their Senate named <hi>Coupe Nole,</hi> who was a hoſier, but in great credit with the people: for ſuch men of occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they are moſt vnruly, are there beſt eſteemed. The King returned to Tours, and kept himſelfe very cloſe, ſo that few ſaw him: for he waxed iealous of all men, ſearing that they would take the gouernment from him, or diminiſh his authoritie; for the which cauſe he remooued all thoſe from him, that he had moſt fauoured, and had been neereſt about him, not diminiſhing their eſtates in any reſpect: but he ſent them away ſome to their offices and charges, and ſome to their houſes, but this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured not long, for ſoone after he died. He did diuers ſtrange things which cauſed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7649:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as many as ſaw them to thinke him out of his wits; but they were not throughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his conditions. As touching ſuſpicious, all great Princes are ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, eſpecially thoſe that be wiſe, and haue had many enimies, and haue offended many as the King our Maſter had. Further, he knew himſelfe not to be beloued of the nobilitie of his realme, nor of a great number of the commonalty. Beſides this, he had more charged his people than euer had any of his predeceſſors: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he was deſirous now in his latter daies (as before I ſaid) to haue eaſed them, but he ſhould haue begun ſooner. King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth by the perſwaſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wiſe and valiant Knights that had ſerued him in the conqueſt of Normandie and Guyenne (which the Engliſhmen held,) was the firſt that began to leuy ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at his pleaſure, without the conſent of the States of his realme; and to ſay the truth, cauſe there was then ſo to do: for the charges were maruellous great, as well for the manning of the countries newly conquered, as alſo for the defeating of the companies of robbers, which went about ſpoiling the realme. For the which cauſe the nobility of Fraunce conſented to the King, and had certaine penſions promiſed them in conſideration of the ſummes of money that ſhould be leuied vpon their lands. If this King had alwaies liued and thoſe of his councel that were about him, he would ſure greatly haue enlarged his realme. But conſidering what hapned after his death, &amp; is like further to happen, he charged maruellouſly his ſoule, and the ſoules of his ſucceſſors by this fact: for he gaue his realme a cruell wound, which will bleed this many a yeere, by entertaining in continuall pay a terrible band of men of armes, after the maner of the Italian Princes. The ſaid King <hi>Charles</hi> leuied in his realme at the hower of his death but 1800000. franks all maner of waies, and had in ordinary about ſeuenteene hundred men of armes, the which he kept in good order, and ſo placed in diuers prouinces for the defence of his realme, that many yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death they rid not ſpoiling vp and downe the countrey, to the great qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes &amp; comfort of his people. But the King our Maſter leuied at his death 4700000. franks, he had in pay fower or fiue thouſand men of armes, and of footemen for the campe and in garriſon, aboue fiue and twenty thouſand: wherefore it is not to be maruelled if he had many phanſies and imaginations in his head, and thought himſelfe not welbeloued. But ſure as theſe matters cauſed him greatly to feare ſome; ſo had he a ſure confidence in many of thoſe whom he had brought vp and highly aduanced, of the which I thinke there were a number, whom death it ſelfe could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue withdrawen from dooing their duty. There came into Pleſſis du Parc, (which was the place where he lay) very few beſides his houſehold ſeruants, and the archers of his guarde being fower hundred, of whom a great number all the day long kept watch and warde at the gate, walking vp and downe the place. No no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man or great perſonage lodged within the caſtell, neither might be ſuffered to enter in, ſaue onely the Lord of Beauieu Duke of Bourbon his ſonne in law. The ſaid ſtell of Pleſſis he had made to be enuironed with a grate of great iron bars, &amp; at the entrie into the ditches thereof had cauſed ſharpe ſpeares of iron, euery one of them hauing many heads, to be maſoned into the wall. He cauſed alſo fower ſtrong watch houſes of iron to be built, and a place to be made in them where men might ſtande and ſhoote at eaſe, which was a ſumptuous thing to behold, and coſt aboue 20000. franks. In the end he put into theſe houſes fortie croſſebowe men, which were day and night in the ditches, &amp; had commiſſion to ſhoote at euery man that approched neere the caſtell after the ſhutting of the gates, til they opened in the morning. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he had an imagination that his ſubiects would be very ready to take the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment into their owne hands when they ſhould ſee conuenient time. And ſure
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7649:123"/>
ſome there were that conſulted to enter into Pleſſis and diſpatch the affaires at their pleaſure, bicauſe nothing was diſpatched; but they durſt not attempt it, wherein they did wiſely, for the K. had giuen good order for that matter. He changed often both the groomes of his chamber and al his other ſeruants, ſaying, that nature delighteth in varietie; and he had with him to beare him company one or two very meane men and of euill report, who might well haue thought if they had been wiſe, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his death they ſhould at the leaſt be put out of office and ſpoiled of all they had, as alſo it hapned. Theſe informed him of no meſſage that was ſent him, not of any matter that was written to him, were it neuer ſo important, vnleſſe it touched the preſeruation of the State, or the defence of his realme: for that was his onely care to be in truce and peace with all men. He gaue to his Phiſition ordinarily euery moneth ten thouſand crownes, and in fiue moneths he receiued of him 54000. He gaue alſo goodly lands to churches; but this gift was made voide, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, for the clergie men had too much.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong men famous for deuotion, he ſent into Calabria for one Frier <hi>Robert,</hi> whom he called the holy man, bicauſe of his holy life, and in whoſe honor the King that now is, cauſed a Church to be built at Pleſſis du Parc, in place of the chappell neere to Pleſſis at the bridge foote. This heremite being twelue yeeres of age entred into a rocke, where he remained till he was fortie three yeeres old, or there about, to wit, euen till this preſent that the King ſent for him by one of the ſtewards of his houſe, whom the Prince of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente the King of Naples ſonne accompanied thither. For the ſaid heremite would not depart thence, without permiſſion both of the Pope and of his Prince; which was great wiſedome in ſo ſimple a man. He builded in the place where he liued two Churches, and neuer ate ſince the time he entred into this ſtrait kinde of life, either fiſh, fleſh, egs, any kinde of whitmeate, or of fat. I neuer ſaw in my time a man of ſo holy life, nor by whoſe mouth the holy Ghoſt ſeemed rather to ſpeake; for he neuer had been ſcholler, but was vtterly vnlearned: true it is that his Italian toong cauſed
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7649:123"/>
ſomwhat the greater admiration of him. This heremite paſſed through Naples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honored and receiued, as if he had been a great Legate ſent from the Sea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike; both by the King and by his children, with whom he communed of the affaires of the Court, as if he had beene a Courtier all the daies of his life. From thence he went to Rome, where he was viſited by al the Cardinals, and had audience giuen him thriſe of the Pope, communing with him alone, and ſitting each time hard by him in a goodly chaire three or fower howers togither; which was great honor to ſo ſimple a perſon. His anſwers were ſo wiſe, that all men woondered at them; ſo far foorth that our holy Father gaue him leaue to erect a new order, called the heremites of Saint <hi>Francis.</hi> From thence he came to the King, who honored him as if he had been the Pope himſelfe, falling downe before him, and deſiring him to prolong his life: whereunto he anſwered as a wiſe man ſhould. I haue often heard him talke with the King that now is, in preſence of all the nobilitie of the realme, and that within theſe two moneths, and ſure he ſeemed by his words, to be inſpired with the holy Ghoſt, otherwiſe he could neuer haue communed of ſuch matters as he did. He is yet liuing, and may change either to better or woorſe: wherefore I will ſpeake no further of him. Some mocked at this heremites comming, whom they called the holy man; but they knew not the deepe cogitations of this wiſe King, neither had ſeene the occaſions that mooued him to ſend for him.</p>
               <p>The King lay in his caſtle of Pleſſis accompanied with few beſides the archers of his gard, and troubled with theſe ſuſpitions aboue rehearſed. Notwithſtanding he had giuen good order for this inconuenience, for he left none of thoſe whom he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected either in towne or countrey, but made his archers to cauſe them to depart and to conueigh them away. No man debated any matter with him, vnleſſe it were of ſome great importance that concerned himſelfe: he ſeemed rather a dead corps then a liuing creature, for he was leaner then a man would beleeue: he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare lled himſelfe ſumptuouſly, yea more ſumptuouſly then in all his life before; for he ware no gowne but of crimſin ſattin furred with good marterns: he gaue gifts to whom it pleaſed him without any ſute; for no man durſt mooue any ſute to him, nor debate any matter with him: he puniſhed faults ſharpely to the end he might be feared, and not loſe his authoritie as himſelfe tould me: he changed officers, caſſed companies of men of armes, diminiſhed penſions, or tooke them cleane away, and told me but a few daies before his death that he paſſed away the time in making &amp; vndoing of men. To be ſhort, he cauſed himſelfe to be more ſpoken of within his realme then euer was any King, and all for feare leſt men ſhould thinke him dead. For as I ſaid, few ſaw him but when they hard of his doings; all men ſtood in feare of him, ſo far foorth that they hardly beleeued him to be ſicke. Out of the realme he had men in all places, as for example in England he had ſome to feede K. <hi>Edward</hi> ſtill with hope of his daughters marriage, &amp; he paied truely both him and his ſeruants all that was due vnto them. Out of Spaine he receiued goodly words and faire promiſes of perfect freindſhip and amitie, and great preſents from all places: he made a good horſe or a good mule to be bought for him whatſoeuer it coſt; but this he did not in this realme, but in ſome ſtrange countrey to perſwade men that he was in health. Dogs he ſent for round about, into Spaine for a kinde of Spaniſh greyhound, called in French Allans; into Britaine for little beagles, grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds and ſpaniels, which he paied deere for; into Valence for little rugged dogs, which he made to be bought aboue the owners own price; into Sicily he ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for good mules, eſpecially to ſome officer of the countrey, for the which he paied double the value; to Naples for horſes, &amp; for diuers ſtrange beaſts into diuers countries, as into

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt to returne to the principall matter, namely, the perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this our hiſtorie of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> and of the affaires of all thoſe great Princes that liued in his time: we muſt ſhew how the treatie of marriage was concluded betweene the King that now is, then Daulphin, and the daughter of the Duke and Ducheſſe of Auſtriche, by meanes of the citizens of Gaunt, to the King of Englands great greefe, who then well perceiued the hope to be fruſtrate, which he had conceiued of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage betweene his daughter and the ſaid Daulphin now King of Fraunce: which he and the Queene his wife had ſo greatly deſired, that they would neuer credit any man that aduertiſed them to the contrarie, were he Engliſh man or ſtranger. For the Councell of England had debated this matter with him, at the ſame time that the King conquered that part of Picardie that ioineth to Calice, alleaging, that after he had ſubdued that, he might eaſily attempt to take Calice and Guiſnes. The like was alſo told him, by the ambaſſadors reſident in England for the Duke and Ducheſſe of Auſtriche, and by the Britons, and diuers others: but he beleeued no whit of all this, which incredulitie turned much to his loſſe. Notwithſtanding I ſuppoſe, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded rather of couetouſnes than ignorance: for he feared the loſſe of the fiftie thouſand crownes the King paid him: beſides that, he was loth to leaue his eaſe and pleaſures, whereunto he was maruellouſly addicted. About the concluſion of this
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7649:124"/>
marriage, an aſſembly was held at Halots in Flaunders, whereat the Duke of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriche now King of Romans, was preſent, togither with certaine deputies for the three eſtates of Flaunders, Brabant, and the other countries belonging to the ſaide Duke and his children. The citizens of Gaunt did many things there contrarie to the Dukes minde; for ſome they baniſhed, and ſome they remooued from about his ſonne: in the end they told him how great deſire they had to ſee this marriage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, therby to obtaine peace, &amp; forced him to conſent therunto. The Duke was very yoong, and accompanied with few noble men: for all the ſubiects of this houſe of Burgundie (very few excepted, I meane of great perſonages, that could haue giuen him counſell or aide in theſe affaires) were, as you haue heard, either dead, or reuolted to the King. As touching himſelfe, he was come thither very ſlenderly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, and now hauing loſt his wife, being Lady of the countrie, he durſt not giue them ſo ſtout language, as before he was accuſtomed. To be ſhort, the King being aduertiſed of all theſe actions by Monſeur <hi>de Cordes,</hi> reioiced much thereat, and a day was appointed when this Lady ſhould be brought to Hedin.</p>
               <p>Not long before the concluſion of this marriage, to wit, in the yeere 1481. the towne of Ayre was yeelded for a ſumme of monie to Monſeur <hi>de Cordes,</hi> by the Lord of Croy of the countrie of Artois, who held it for the Duke of Auſtriche, and the Lord of Beures his captaine. The towne is very ſtrong, ſituate in the countrie of Artois, and the deliuerie thereof increaſed the Flemmings deſire to further this marriage, bicauſe it ſtandeth vpon the very entrance into Flaunders. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they wiſhed the weakening of their Prince, yet were they not willing to haue the King ſo neere a neighbor to their frontiers. After theſe matters aboue mentioned were fully concluded, ambaſſadors came to the King out of Flaunders and Brabant, but all depended vpon them of Gaunt; both bicauſe of their force, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the children were in their hands, and for that they were alwaies the ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of all tumults. There came alſo from the King of Romanes for the pacifying of his dominions certaine Knights, yoong men like himſelfe, and of ſmall experience, whoſe names were Maſter <hi>Iohn de Bergues</hi> and Maſter <hi>Baudouin de Launoy,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Secretaries. The King was brought maruellous low with ſicknes, ſo that hardly he ſuffered himſelfe to be ſeene, and made great difficultie to ſweare the treatie, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was loth to come abrode in ſight: notwithſtanding in the end he ſware it. It was very auantageous for him; for in all aſſemblies that had beene held heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore about this marriage, he neuer required but the countie of Artois or Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, one of the two: but now the Lords of Gaunt (as he termed them) cauſed them both to be yeelded vnto him, togither with the counties of Maſconnois, Charolois, and Auxerrois; yea and if it had lien in them to haue put into his hands, Hainault and Namur, and all the ſeniories of this houſe of Burgundie, being of the French language, they would willingly haue done it, thereby to affeeble their Prince. The King our Maſter being a wiſe Prince vnderſtood well, that no account was to be made of Flaunders, nor the Earle thereof, without he had the countrie of Artois, which lying betweene the King of Fraunce and the Flemmings, is as it were a bridle to them. For in the countrie of Artois are leuied very good ſoldiers, to ſcourge the Flemmings when they play the fooles. Wherefore by taking away from the Earle of Flaunders the countrie of Artois, he left him the pooreſt Prince in the world, and without all obedience of his ſubiects, ſaue onely at the pleaſure of them of Gaunt. After this ambaſſage was returned home, the ſaid Lady was led to Hedin, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered into the hands of Monſeur <hi>de Cordes</hi> in the yeere 1483. She was conueied thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Lady of Rauaſtain, baſtard daughter to Duke <hi>Philip</hi> of Burgundie, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7649:125"/>
was receiued there by the Duke and Ducheſſe of Bourbon that now are, and by the Lord of Albret, and diuers others ſent thither by the King; who led hir to Amboiſe where the Daulphin lay. If the Duke of Auſtriche could haue reſcued hir before ſhe was paſſed out of his dominions from them that conueied hir, he would willingly haue done it: but they of Gaunt had ſent hir well accompanied. And as touching the ſaid Duke, all his ſubiects began to diſobey him, ſo far foorth that a great number tooke part with them of Gaunt, bicauſe they had his ſonne in their hands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued from him, and placed about him ſuch as pleaſed them: and among the reſt that were reſident at Gaunt, was the Lord of Rauaſtain brother to the Duke of Cleues, principall gouernor of the ſaid yoong infant called Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> who is yet liuing, and like to be a great Prince, if God ſpare him life. Whoſoeuer reioiced at this marriage, the King of England was highly diſpleaſed therewith; for he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it great reproch and diſhonor to be thus deluded, and feared both the loſſe of the penſion the King paid him, which the Engliſh men called Tribute; and alſo that the contempt heereof would ſtir his ſubiects to rebellion againſt him, bicauſe he would giue no eare to good aduice. Further, he ſaw the King with great force neere to his dominions: for the which cauſes he conceiued ſuch inward griefe when he heard theſe newes, that ſoone after he ended his life, ſome ſay of a catarrhe. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer his diſeaſe were, the report goeth, that the ſorrow conceiued of this marriage cauſed the diſeaſe, whereof he died ſoone after in the moneth of Aprill, anno 1483. It is a foule fault in a Prince, to truſt more to his owne braine, than to the aduice of a great number: for it cauſeth oftentimes both great ſorrow, and alſo loſſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerable.</p>
               <p>Immediately after King <hi>Edvvards</hi> death, the King our Maſter was aduertiſed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſeemed nothing ioifull of the newes: but ſoone after receiued letters from the D. of Gloceſter, who had vſurped the crowne of England (ſigning his letters by the name of <hi>Richard,)</hi> &amp; cruelly murthered the King his brothers two children. This King <hi>Richard</hi> ſought the Kings friendſhip, &amp; was deſirous, as I ſuppoſe, to haue this penſion paid alſo vnto him. But the K. would make no anſwer to his letters, neither giue his meſſenger audience, but eſteemed him a wicked &amp; cruell tyrant. For after K. <hi>Edvvards</hi> death, the ſaid Duke of Gloceſter had done homage to his nephew as to his ſoueraigne Lord and King, and yet immediately thereupon committed this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cauſed in open parlament the ſaid King <hi>Edvvards</hi> two daughters to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded &amp; proclaimed baſtards, vnder colour of a certaine matter which he prooued by the teſtimonie of a biſhop of Bathe, who ſomtime had been in great credit with King <hi>Edvvard,</hi> but afterward fell into his diſgrace, and was laid in priſon, and made to fine for his deliuerance. This Biſhop affirmed that King <hi>Edvvard</hi> being in loue with a certaine gentlewoman in England (whom he named) promiſed hir marriage to haue his pleaſure of hir, which promiſe he ſaid was made in his preſence, and thereupon the King lay with hir, minding onely to abuſe hir. Such paſtimes are very dangerous, eſpecially when ſuch poofe may be brought foorth: But I haue knowne many a courtier that would not haue loſt a good aduenture that liked him in ſuch a caſe for want of promiſe. This wicked Biſhop buried reuenge in his hart the ſpace of twenty yeeres. But God plagued him for his wickednes: for he had a ſonne whom he loued entirely, and whom King <hi>Richard</hi> ſo much fauored, that he meant to giue him to wife one of theſe two daughters, degraded from their dignitie, at this preſent Queene of England and mother of two goodly children. The ſaid ſonne being in a ſhip of war by King <hi>Richard</hi> his Maſters commandement, was taken vpon the coaſt of Normandie, and bicauſe of the contention that fell betweene thoſe that tooke
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7649:125"/>
him: led to the court parlament of Paris, and there put in priſon in the petit Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellet, where in the end he ſtarued for hunger and pouertie. As touching King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> he liued not long vnpuniſhed: for God raiſed vp an enimy againſt him euen at <note place="margin">This error you are admoniſhed of before.</note> that very inſtant being poore, hauing no right to the crowne of England, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and of no eſtimation, ſaue that as touching his owne perſon he was well condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and had endured many troubles. For the greateſt part of his life he had been priſoner in Britaine to Duke <hi>Francis,</hi> who entertained him well for a priſoner from the eighteenth yeere of his age.

In Almaine he had the Swiſſers as obedient to him as his owne ſubiects.

rehearſing to him how after King <hi>Charles</hi> his fathers death, he comming to the State, put out of office all the valiant and woorthie knights of this realme that had ſerued his father in the conqueſt of Normandy and Guienne, in chaſing the Engliſh men out of Fraunce, and reſtoring the realme to peace and quietnes, (for himſelfe found it both quiet and rich:) which his hard dealing with the ſaid knights, turned greatly to his preiudice, for thereof ſprang the war called THE WEALE PVBLIKE in this ſtorie aboue mentioned, which had almoſt ſet him beſides his crowne. Soone after his communication with the Daulphine his ſonne, and the accompliſhment of this marriage aboue mentioned; he fell vpon a monday into the diſeaſe whereof he died: his ſicknes endured til the ſaturday after being the 30. of Auguſt, in the yeer 1483. And bicauſe I was preſent at his death, I minde to ſpeake ſomwhat thereof. When this diſeaſe tooke him he loſt his ſpeech as before, which being recouered he felt his body weaker than euer it was, notwithſtanding that he were ſo lowe brought before that he could hardly lift his hand to his mouth, and looked ſo poorely and miſerably, that it pitied euery mans hart that ſawe him: he accounted himſelfe now as dead. Wherefore he ſent incontinent for the Lord of Beauieu now Duke of Bourbon his ſonne in law, commanding him to go to Amboiſe to the King his ſon, (for ſo he termed him:) he recommended alſo vnto him diuers of his ſeruants, and gaue him the whole charge and gouernment of the yoong King, and commanded expreſſely that certaine whom he named ſhould not come neere his ſonne, alleaging diuers good reaſons on that behalfe. And if the ſaid Lord of Beauieu had obſerued his commandements, at the leaſt part of them (for ſome were vnreaſonable and not to be obſerued) I thinke he ſhould thereby haue benefited both the realme and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, conſidering what hath hapned ſince in Fraunce.

His ſpeech neuer failed him after he recouered it, neither were his wits ſo freſh at any time as then: for he purged continually, by meanes whereof all fumes voided that troubled his head.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E diſcourſed continually of ſome matter or other, and that very grauely, and his diſeaſe endured from monday till ſaturday night. Wherefore I will now make compariſon betweene the troubles and ſorrowes he cauſed others to ſuffer, and thoſe he ſuffered himſelfe before his death, bicauſe I truſt they haue ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him into paradiſe, and been part of his purgatorie. For notwithſtanding that they were not ſo grieuous, neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſo long, as thoſe which he cauſed diuers others to ſuffer; yet bicauſe his vocation in this world was higher then theirs, by meanes whereof he had neuer beene contraried, but ſo well obeied that he ſeemed a Prince able to haue gouerned all Europe: this little trouble that he endured contrarie to his accoſtomed nature, was to him a great torment. He hoped euer in this good heremite that was at Pleſſis whom he had cauſed to come to him out of Calabria, and continually ſent to him: ſaying, that if it pleaſed him he could prolong his life. For notwithſtanding all theſe commandements giuen to thoſe whom he ſent to the Daulphine his ſonne, yet came his ſpirits againe to him, in ſuch ſort that he was in hope to recouer: and if it had ſo happened, he would eaſily haue diſparckled the aſſembly ſent to this new King. But bicauſe of the vaine hope he had in this heremite, a Doctor of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and certaine others thought good to aduertiſe him that his onely hope muſt be in the mercie of God: and they deuiſed that Maſter <hi>Iames Cothier</hi> his Phiſition, in whom he had repoſed his whole confidence, and to whom he gaue monethly ten thouſand crownes in hope he would prolong his life: ſhould be preſent when this ſpeech ſhould be vſed to him. This was Maſter <hi>Oliuer</hi> his barbars deuiſe, to the end he might wholie thinke vpon his conſcience, and leaue all his other imaginations conceiued of this holie man, and of the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iames</hi> his Phiſition. But euen like as he had aduanced the ſaid Maſter <hi>Oliuer</hi> and others too ſuddenly without any deſert, to a higher eſtate than was fit for them: euen ſo they tooke vpon them bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to do ſuch a meſſage to ſo great a Prince otherwiſe than became them, not vſing that reuerence and humilitie that was to be vſed in ſuch a caſe, and ſuch as they would haue vſed whom he had brought vp of long time, and lately commanded out of his preſence for the ſuſpicions conceiued of them. And againe, like as vnto two great perſonages whom he had put to death in his time, (to wit the Duke of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and the Earle of Saint Paule: for one of the which he repented him at his death, and for the other not;) he had ſent a ſharpe meſſage of death by Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners appointed thereunto; the which briefly pronounced their ſentence vnto them, and foorthwith gaue them confeſſors and but a verie ſhort ſpace to diſpoſe of their conſciences: euen ſo the aboue named ſignified his death vnto him rudely and in fewe words ſaying; Sir it is reaſon we do our duties, hope no more in this holie man, nor any other thing, for ſure you are but dead: therefore thinke vpon your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for your hower is come, and euery one of them ſaid ſomwhat briefly to him to that effect. But he anſwered, I truſt God will helpe me, and peraduenture I am
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7649:127"/>
not ſo ſicke as you ſuppoſe. What a ſharpe coroſife was it to him to heare theſe newes and this cruell ſentence? for neuer man feared death more than he, nor ſought ſo many waies to auoide it as he did. Moreouer, in all his life time he had giuen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to all his ſeruants, as well my ſelfe as others, that when we ſhould ſee him in danger of death, we ſhould onely mooue him to confeſſe himſelfe &amp; diſpoſe of his conſcience, not ſounding in his eares this dreadfull word <hi>Death,</hi> knowing that he ſhould not be able patiently to heare that cruel ſentence: notwithſtanding he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured both that and diuers other puniſhments till the verie hower of death more patiently than euer I ſawe any man. To his ſonne whom he called King, he ſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meſſages and confeſſed himſelfe verie deuoutly, and ſaid diuers praiers anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Sacraments he receiued, which alſo he himſelfe demanded. He ſpake as hartily as if he had not beene ſicke, and talked of all matters touching the King his ſonnes eſtate; and among other things gaue commandement that the Lord of Cordes ſhould not depart from his ſonne by the ſpace of halfe a yeere after his death: and further, that he ſhould be entreated to attempt nothing againſt Calice nor elſewhere; ſaying, that notwithſtanding he had deuiſed theſe enterpriſes for the Kings profit, and the benefit of the realme: yet were they verie dangerous, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of Calice, for feare of moouing the Engliſh men thereby to war Further, he willed eſpecially that after his death the realme ſhould reſt in peace the ſpace of fiue or ſixe yeeres, a matter which he would neuer yeeld vnto during his life though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie needfull: for notwithſtanding that it were great and large, yet was it in poore &amp; miſerable eſtate, eſpecially bicauſe of the paſſing to and fro of the men of armes, who continually remooued from one countrey to an other. He gaue order alſo that no quarrell ſhould be picked in Britaine, but that Duke <hi>Francis</hi> ſhould be ſuffered to liue in quiet, and not be put in any doubt or feare of warre, neither yet any other neighbour bordering vpon the realme, to the end the King and the realme might reſt in peace till the King were of yeeres to diſpoſe thereof at his owne pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how vndiſcreetly his death was ſignified to him, which I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed bicauſe I began to make a compariſon betweene thoſe euils which he had cauſed diuers of his ſubiects to ſuffer, and thoſe he himſelfe ſuffered before his death, to the end you may perceiue that notwithſtanding they were not ſo greeuous, nor ſo long (as I haue ſaid:) yet were they greeuous to him conſidering his nature, which demanded obedience, &amp; had been better obeied than any Prince in his time; ſo that one halfe word contrarying his minde was to him a greeuous puniſhment. Fiue or ſixe daies before his death he had al men in ſuſpition, eſpecially all that were woorthie of credit and authoritie, yea, he grew iealous of his owne ſonne, and cauſed him to be ſtraightly guarded, neither did any man ſee him or ſpeake with him but by his commandement: at the length he began to ſtand in doubt alſo of his daughter, and of his ſonne in law now Duke of Bourbon, and would needs know what men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Pleſſis with them, and in the end brake off an aſſembly that the Duke of Bourbon his ſonne in law held there by his commandement. Moreouer, at the ſame time that his ſaid ſonne in law and the Earle of Dunois (returning from the conuoie of the ambaſſage that came to Amboiſe to the marriage of the King his ſonne and the Queene) entred into the caſtle of Pleſſis, with a great bande of men: the King who cauſed the gates to be ſtraightly kept, being in the gallerie that looketh into the court of the ſaid caſtle; cauſed one of the captaines of his guard to come to him, whom he commanded to feele as he talked with the ſaid noble mens ſeruants whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they wore any brigandines vnder their cloakes, not making ſhewe as though he came purpoſely for that intent. Heereby you may perceiue if he cauſed diuers
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7649:128"/>
others to liue in feare and ſuſpicion vnder him: whether he were paid now with the like himſelfe; for of whom could he be aſſured, miſtruſting his ſonne, his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his ſonne in lawe? Wherefore thus much I will ſay not onely of him, but of all other Princes that deſire to be feared: that they neuer feele the reuenge thereof till their age, and then their penance is to feare all men. What great greefe thinke you was it to this poore King to be troubled with theſe paſſions? He had a Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on called Maſter <hi>Iames Cothier,</hi> to whom he gaue in fiue moneths 54000. crownes, after the rate of 10000. the moneth, and 4000. ouer, beſides the Biſhopricke of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens for his nephew, and other offices and lands for him and his friends. The ſaid Phiſition vſed him ſo roughly, that a man would not giue his ſeruant ſo ſharpe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as he gaue the King; and yet the King ſo much feared him, that he durſt not command him out of his preſence: for notwithſtanding that he complained to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of him, yet durſt he not change him as he did all his other ſeruants, bicauſe this Phiſition once ſaid thus boldly vnto him; I know that one day you will commaund me away as you do all your other ſeruants, but you ſhall not liue eight daies after, binding it with a great oath. Which words put the King in ſuch feare, that euer after he flattered him, and beſtowed gifts vpon him, which was a maruellous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie to him in this world, conſidering of how many noble men and gentlemen he had been obeied.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he had cauſed diuers cruell priſons to be made, as for example, cages being eight foote ſquare, and one foote more than a mans height, ſome of iron, and ſome of wood, plated with iron both within and without with horrible iron works. He that firſt deuiſed them was the Biſhop of Verdun, who incontinent was himſelfe put into the firſt that was made, where he remained fowerteene yeeres. Many haue curſed him for his deuiſe, and among others my ſelfe, for I lay in one of them vnder the King that now reigneth the ſpace of eight moneths. He had alſo cauſed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Almains to make terrible heauie irons to lay men in, among the which there was a fetter to put on their feete very hard to be opened like to a carquan, with a waightie chaine, and a great iron ball at the end thereof, heauy beyong all meaſure. Theſe irons were called the Kings nets. Notwithſtanding I haue ſeene diuers gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen lie in them as priſoners, who came foorth afterward with great honor, and were aduanced by him to great eſtates: as for example, a ſonne of the Lord of Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuze of Flaunders taken priſoner in the wars, whom the King afterward richely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and made one of his chamber, &amp; Seneſchall of Aniou, and gaue him charge of a hundred launces; and in like maner the Lord of Piennes and the Lord of Vergy taken priſoners alſo in the wars, who both had charge of men of armes vnder the King and other goodly offices, and were of the priuie chamber either to him or his ſonne. The like happened alſo to the Lord of Richbourg the Conſtables bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to one <hi>Roquebertin</hi> of the country of Cathelonie being likewiſe taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in the wars, whom he afterward highly aduanced with diuers others of diuers countries too long to reherſe. But now to returne to the matter. As in his time theſe diuers and ſundrie cruell priſons were deuiſed: euen ſo he before his death laie in the like, yea in a much crueller priſon than any of them, and was in greater feare than they that ſtood in feare of him, which I account as a great grace towards him, and as part of his purgatorie, and rehearſe it onely to ſhew that euery man of what eſtate or condition ſoeuer he be, is puniſhed either ſecretly or openly, eſpecially thoſe that puniſh others. Further, the King a little before his death encloſed his caſtel of Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis with a grate of iron bars, and at the fower corners of the ſaid caſtell cauſed fower ſtrong-watch houſes of iron to be built. The ſaid grate was made directly ouer
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7649:128"/>
againſt the caſtell wall round about the caſtell on the outer ſide of the ditch, which was very ſteepe. He cauſed alſo to be maſoned into the wall a great number of iron ſpeares, each of them hauing diuers heads ſet cloſe togither. Moreouer, he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ten croſſebowe men to be continually in the ſaid ditches, and to lie in the fower iron houſes built in the bottome of the ſaid ditches, and gaue them commandement to ſhoote at euery man that approched neere to the grate, before the gate opened. He knew well that this fortification was to no purpoſe againſt a great force or an armie, but that he doubted not: his onely feare was, that certaine noble men of his realme hauing intelligence in the caſtell, would attempt to enter into it in the night, partly by loue and partly by force, and take the gouernment vpon them, and make him liue as a man bereft of his wits, and vnwoorthie to rule. The caſtell gate neuer opened before eight of the clocke in the morning, neither was the drawe bridge let downe till that hower, and then entred his officers, and the captaines of his garde placed the ordinarie warders, and appointed archers to the watch both at the gate and within the court, as if it had beene a frontire towne ſtraightly kept: neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred any man without the Kings commandement but by the wicket, ſaue the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of his houſe, and ſuch like officers that went not to him. Is it poſſible then to hold a King (I meane vſing him like a Prince) in a ſtraiter priſon than he held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? The cages wherein he held others were about eight foote ſquare, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a Prince had but a little court in the caſtell to walke in, yea and ſeldome came he into that: for vſually he kept himſelfe in the gallerie, from whence he neuer ſtirred but when he went to maſſe, at which time he paſſed through the chambers, and not through the Court. Thinke you that he was not in feare as well as others, ſeeing he locked himſelfe in after this ſort, kept himſelfe thus cloſe, ſtood in ſuch feare of his children and neereſt kinſmen, and changed and remooued his ſeruants from day to day, whom he had brought vp and whoſe good eſtate depended wholy vpon him, in ſuch ſort that he durſt truſt none of them, but bound himſelfe in theſe ſtrange chaines and bands? The place I confeſſe was larger than a common priſon, ſo was his eſtate greater than a common priſoners. But a man will ſay peraduenture, that other Princes haue been more ſuſpicious than he, whereunto I agree: but none ſure in our time, neither any ſo wiſe as he, nor that had ſo good ſubiects as he had: &amp; as touching them, peraduenture they were cruell tyrants, but he neuer puniſhed any without deſert. All this aboue written I haue rehearſed, not ſo much to publiſh the ſuſpicions of the King our Maſter: as partly to prooue that the patient enduring of theſe paſſions, being equall with thoſe he had cauſed others to endure; and of this ſicknes being ſharpe and troubleſome to him, and the which he feared greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fell into it; is to be accounted as a puniſhment God gaue him in this world, to eaſe him in the world to come: and partly to giue an example to thoſe that ſhall come after him, to haue ſome more compaſſion on their people than he had, and to be leſſe rigorous in puniſhing than he was. Notwithſtanding for my part I am not able to accuſe him, neither ſaw I euer a better Prince; for though himſelfe preſſed his ſubiects, yet would he ſuffer none other ſo to do friend or foe.</p>
               <p>After all theſe feares, ſorrowes, and ſuſpicions, God (according to his accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med goodnes) wrought a miracle vpon him, healing him both in ſoule and bodie: for he tooke him out of this miſerable world, being perfect of ſenſe, vnderſtanding, and memorie, hauing receiued all his ſacraments without all griefe to mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and talking continually euen within a Pater noſter while of his death; ſo that he gaue order for his funerall, and named thoſe that ſhould accompanie his bodie to the graue; ſaying euer, that he truſted to die on no day but ſaturday, and that our

I knew him &amp; ſerued him in the flower of his age, &amp; in his great proſperitie; yet neuer ſaw I himfree from toile of body and trouble of minde. Aboue al paſtimes he loued hunting &amp; hauking in their ſeaſons, hunting eſpecially. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching women, he was free from that vice all the time that I ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him: for a little before my comming to him, he loſt one of his ſonnes, whoſe death he much lamented; and ſoone after made a ſolemne vow to God in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, neuer to accompanie with any woman but the Queene his wife. Whereunto notwithſtanding that he were bound by the lawes of marriage; yet was it much that he had ſuch ſtay of himſelfe, eſpecially the Queene being none of thoſe in whoſe beautie a man could take great delight, but otherwiſe a very vertuous Lady. In this paſtime of hunting he tooke almoſt as much paine as pleaſure; for the toile was great, bicauſe he ran the Hart to death by force. Beſides that, he aroſe very early in the morning, and oftentimes went far, neither could any weather make him leaue his ſport. Somtime alſo he returned very wearie and in maner euer diſpleaſed with one or other: for this game is not alwaies made as they wiſh that haue the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereof: notwithſtanding in all mens opinions, he for his part vnderſtood it better than any man in his time. In this paſtime he exerciſed himſelfe continually, lodging about in the villages till wars began. For almoſt euery ſommer there was ſomewhat to do betweene Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of Burgundie and him: but when win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter approched they vſed to make truce. He had great wars alſo for the countie of Rouſſillion with King <hi>Iohn</hi> of Arragon, the King of Spaines father that now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. For notwithſtanding that they were very poore, and in war with their ſubiects, namely them of Barſelonne and others, and that the ſonne were of no force: (for he expected the inheritance of King <hi>Friderike</hi>

               <p>Thus you ſee that the pleaſure the King had was but one ſmall time in the yeere, and that ioined with great toile and trauell of his perſon: when his body was at reſt, his minde was occupied, for he had to do in many places, and buſied himſelfe as much with his neighbors affaires as with his own, ſeeking to place men in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP13.NOTE2">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7649:129"/>
peace or truce, which notwithſtanding when he had obtained, he could not long away with. He medled with many trifling matters in his realme, which he might well haue paſſed ouer: but ſuch was his diſpoſition and life. And to ſay the truth, his memory was ſo excellent that he forgat nothing, but knew all the world, all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and all men of eſtimation round about him; ſo that he ſeemed a Prince woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier to gouern the whole world than one realm alone. Of his youth I am able to ſay nothing, for I was not with him at that time; notwithſtanding what I haue heard, that I will report. Being but eleuen yeeres of age he was buſied by certaine Princes and others of the realme, in a war againſt K. <hi>Charles</hi> his father, called <hi>la Praguerie,</hi> which endured not long. And when he was growen to mans eſtate he married the King of Scotlands daughter <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP13.NOTE3">

                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref>: after hir death bicauſe of the factions and troubles that were in the King his fathers court, he retired into his owne countrey of Daulphine, whither a great number of gentlemen accompanied him, yea many mo than he was able to maintaine. While he was in Daulphine he married the Duke of Sauoies daughter, and ſoone after fel at variance with his father in law, ſo that ſharpe war aroſe betweene them. King <hi>Charles</hi> ſeeing his ſonne ſo well accompanied with gentlemen and men of armes, determined to go againſt him in perſon with great force, and to chaſe him out of the countrey by ſtrong hand: wherefore he put himſelfe vpon the way, and endeuored to withdraw his ſonnes men from him, commanding them as his ſubiects vnder paine of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to repaire vnto him. Whereunto diuers obeied, to the King our Maſters great griefe; who ſeeing his fathers indignation againſt him, determined (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that his force were great) to depart thence, and leaue the countrey to his fathers diſpoſing. And in this eſtate trauelled he through Burgundy with a ſmall traine to Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> who receiued him very honorably, furniſhed him with money to maintaine his eſtate, and gaue yeerely penſions to his principall ſeruants, namely to the Earle of Cominges, the Lord of Montauban &amp; others, and beſtowed alſo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his being there diuers large gifts vpon his other ſeruants. Notwithſtanding, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he entertained ſuch a number, his mony failed often to his great griefe, ſo that he was forced to borow ſom where or other, otherwiſe his men would haue forſaken him; which vndoubtedly is a great trouble to a Prince vnaccuſtomed thereunto. Thus you ſee that he was not without vexation and anguiſh of minde during his abode in this houſe of Burgundy: for he was forced to faune both vpon the Duke and his principall ſeruants, leaſt they ſhould waxe weary of him, for he was there a long time, to wit, the ſpace of ſixe yeeres. Beſides that, his father ſent ambaſſadors continually to the Duke, requiring him either to put him foorth of his dominions or ſend him backe to him. Wherefore it is to be thought that he was not idle nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great vexation of minde. All theſe things conſidered: when may a man ſay that he liued in ioy and pleaſure? Sure in mine opinion from his childhood till his death he was in continuall toile and trouble, ſo that if all his pleaſant and ioyfull daies were numbred, I thinke they ſhould be found but fewe: yea I am fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that for one pleaſant there ſhould be found twenty diſpleaſant. He liued about threeſcore and one yeeres; notwithſtanding that he had conceiued an imagination that he ſhould neuer paſſe threeſcore, ſaying, that no King of Fraunce of long time paſſed that age, ſome ſaie none ſince <hi>Charles</hi> the great. Notwithſtanding the King our Maſter when he died was well forward in the threeſcore and one yeere.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of Burgundie what reſt or quietnes had he more than the King our Maſter? True it is that in his youth he was not much troubled, for he attempted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing til the two &amp; twenty yeere of his age, but liued till that time in helth and at his
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7649:130"/>
eaſe. But then he began to buſie himſelfe with his fathers officers, whom his father maintained againſt him: for the which cauſe he abſented himſelfe and went into Holland, where he was well receiued and had intelligence with them of Gaunt, and ſometime alſo went thither himſelfe. He had not one peny of his father, but this countrey of Holland was maruellous rich and gaue him goodly preſents, as did alſo diuers great townes of his other Seniories, hoping thereby to winne his fauour in time to come. For it is a common thing, eſpecially among the vulgare ſort, to loue better, and ſeeke rather to him whoſe power is growing, than to him who is already ſo great that he can be no greater <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP13.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref>. For the which cauſe Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> when men told him that they of Gaunt loued his ſonne maruellous wel, &amp; that he could skill of their humor: was woont to anſwer, that their Prince in expectation they euer loued deerly; but their Prince in poſſeſſion they hated euer extremely, which ſaying proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued true. For after D. <hi>Charles</hi> began to reigne ouer them they neuer loued him, and that they well declared as before I haue rehearſed: he alſo for his part bare them as little good will, notwithſtanding they did his poſteritie more harme than they could do him. But proceed, after the time that Duke <hi>Charles</hi> mooued war for the townes in Picardie, which the King our Maſter had redeemed of Duke <hi>Philip</hi> his father, and ioined himſelfe with the Princes of this realme, in the war called THE WEALE PVBLIKE: he neuer was quiet, but in continuall trauell both of bodie and minde. For his hart was ſo inflamed with deſire of glorie, that he attempted to conquer all that lay about him. All ſommer he kept the field with great danger of his perſon, and tooke vpon himſelfe the charge and care of the whole armie: all which trouble ſeemed yet not ſufficient to him. He was the firſt vp and the laſt downe, as if he had beene the pooreſt ſoldier in his campe. If he reſted from wars at any time in winter, yet was he buſied all day long from ſixe of the clocke in the morning, either in leuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of money, or receiuing ambaſſadors, or giuing them audience. In this trauell and miſerie ended he his daies, and was ſlaine of the Swiſſers before Nancy, as you haue heard; ſo that a man may iuſtly ſay, that he neuer had good day from the time that ambition firſt entred into his minde, till the hower of his death. And what got he by all this trauell? what needed he thus to haue toiled himſelfe, being ſo rich a Prince, and hauing ſo many goodly townes and ſeniories vnder his ſubiection, where he might haue liued in great ioy and proſperitie, if it had ſo pleaſed him? I muſt now ſpeake of <hi>Edward</hi> K. of England, who was ſo great &amp; mighty a Prince. In his youth he ſawe the Duke of Yorke his father diſcomfited and ſlaine in battell, &amp; with him the Earle of Warwicks father <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP13.NOTE6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref>, the which Earle of Warwicke gouerned King <hi>Edward</hi> in his youth, and all his affaires; yea to ſay the truth made him King, and was the onely man that defeated his enimie King <hi>Henry,</hi> who had raigned many yeeres in England, and was lawfull King both in mine opinion, and in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole world. But as touching great realmes and ſeniories God holdeth them in his hand, and diſpoſeth of them at his pleaſure; for all proceedeth of him. The cauſe that mooued the Earle of Warwick to ſerue the houſe of Yorke againſt King <hi>Henry,</hi> who was of the houſe of Lancaſter, was this. The Earle of Warwicke and the Duke of Sommerſet fell at variance in King <hi>Henries</hi> court, who was a very ſimple man: the Queene his wife being of the houſe of Aniou, daughter to <hi>Rene</hi> King of Sicilie, tooke part with the Duke of Sommerſet againſt the Earle. But conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that they had all acknowledged both King <hi>Henry</hi> and his father and grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their lawfull Princes: the ſaid Lady ſhould haue done much better to haue taken vpon hir the office of Iudge or mediator betweene them, than to take part with either of them, as the ſequele well declared. For heereupon aroſe war, which
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7649:130"/>
continued nine and twenty yeeres: during the which ſpace many bloodie battels were fought, and in the end, all in maner both of the one partie and the other ſlaine. Now to ſpeake a word or two of factions: ſurely they are maruellous dangerous, eſpecially among great men, who are naturally inclined to nouriſh and maintaine them. But you will ſay peraduenture, that by this meanes the Prince ſhall haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of all things that paſſe, and thereby hold both the parties in the greater feare. In truth I can well agree that a yoong Prince vſe this order among Ladies: for by this meanes he ſhall haue pleaſure and ſport ynough, and vnderſtand of all their newes: but to nouriſh factions among men, yea among Princes and men of vertue and courage, nothing can be more dangerous, bicauſe by that meanes he ſhall kindle an vnquenchable fire in his houſe: for foorthwith one of the parties will ſuppoſe the King to be againſt them, and then to fortifie themſelues take intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with his enimies. The factions of Orleans and Burgundie prooue this point ſufficiently; for the wars that ſprang therof continued threeſcore and twelue yeeres, the Engliſh men being parties in them, who thought to haue conquered the whole realme. But to returne to King <hi>Edward,</hi> he was very yoong when his father was ſlaine, and the beautifulleſt Prince in the world: but after he had vanquiſhed all his enimies, he gaue himſelfe wholy to pleaſures, as to dames, feaſting, banketting, and hunting; in the which delicacies he continued about ſixteene yeeres <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP13.NOTE7">
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref>, to wit, till the Earle of Warwicke and he fell at variance, in the which wars notwithſtanding that the King were chaſed out of his realme; yet continued he not long in that eſtate: for he ſoone returned, and hauing obtained the victorie, more abandoned himſelfe to all pleaſures than before. He feared no man, but fed himſelfe maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fat, by meanes whereof in the flower of his age diſeaſes grew vpon him, ſo that he died in a maner ſuddenly, of an Apoplexie, and his heires males loſt the crowne, as before you haue heard.</p>
               <p>In this our age raigned alſo two valiant and wiſe Princes, namely <hi>Mathias</hi> King of Hungarie, and <hi>Mahomet Ottoman</hi> Emperor of Turkie. This King <hi>Mathias</hi> was ſonne to a valiant knight called the white knight of Vallachie <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP13.NOTE8">

He by the counſell of certaine cauſed the white knights two ſonnes to be apprehended, alleaging that their father had vſurped too great rule and authoritie in the realme, and that the ſonnes being gentlemen of great courage might peraduenture attempt the like. Wherefore the ſaid King <hi>Launcelot</hi> reſolued to lay them both in priſon, and inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent put the elder to death <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP13.NOTE12">

And I ſuppoſe that God tooke in good part the great ſeruices his father had done. For ſoone after King <hi>Launcelot</hi> was poiſoned at Prage in Bohemia <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP13.NOTE13">

Incontinently after King <hi>Lancelots</hi> death, the Barons and Nobles of the realme aſſembled to chooſe a new King: for the cuſtome of the countrey is, when the King dieth without iſſue, that the Nobles

And while they were there in great diuiſion about their choſe; the white Knights widow mother to <hi>Mathias</hi> came into the towne with a goodly traine: for bicauſe ſhe had great treaſure left hir by hir husband; ſhe was ſoone able to leuie great forces: and further, I thinke ſhe had good intelligence both in the towne and alſo among the Nobilitie, bicauſe of the great ſway hir husband had borne in the realme.

He was one of the valianteſt men that liued in his time, and obtained great victories againſt the Turks, without all damage to his owne realme, the which he inlarged on all ſides, aſwell towards Bohemia the greateſt part whereof he held, as alſo towards Valachie where he was borne, and towards Sclauonie. In like maner vpon the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of Almaine he wan the greateſt part of Auſtrich from the Emperor <hi>Frederic</hi> now raigning, and poſſeſſed it till his death, which hapned in the yeere 1491. in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna the chiefe towne of Auſtrich.

All his affaires were diſpatched by himſelfe or by his direction. Before his death his ſubiects ſtood in great feare of him, for he waxed cruell, and ſoone after fell into a greeuous and vncurable diſeaſe being but yoong, to wit, eight and twenty yeeres of age <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP13.NOTE15">

As touching worldly pleaſures this Turke had his fill; for he ſpent the greateſt part of his life in them, and had he not been ſo much addicted to them, vndoubtedly he would haue done much more miſchiefe. There was no fleſhly vice that he was free from, but in gluttony he paſſed, and according to his diet, diſeaſes fell vpon him: for euery ſpring (as I haue heard thoſe report that haue ſeene him) his legs ſwelled as big as a mans body, notwithſtanding they brake not, but the ſwelling aſſwaged of it ſelf. No ſurgeon could tell the cauſe of this diſeaſe ſaue onely that it proceeded of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie, and it may be that it was ſome ſpeciall puniſhment of God. His ſaid diſeaſe was the cauſe he came ſo ſeldome abroad, and kept himſelfe ſo cloſe in his chariot, fearing that the miſerable eſtate he was in, would cauſe his ſubiects to deſpiſe him. He died being two and fifty yeeres of age <ref target="#S5602.BK6.CHAP13.NOTE26">

                  <head>The concluſion of the Author.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ow ſee heere a great number of great perſonages dead in ſhort ſpace, who trauelled ſo mightily, and indured ſo many anguiſhes and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes to purchaſe honor and renoume, whereby they abridged their liues, yea and peraduenture charged their ſoules. I ſpeake not this of the Turke, for I make account he is lodged with his predeceſſors; but our King and the reſt, I truſt, God hath taken to his mercy. Now to ſpeake of this point as a man vnlearned, but hauing ſome experience: had it not been better both for theſe great Princes themſelues and all their ſubiects that liued vnder them, and ſhall liue vnder their ſucceſſors, to haue held a meane in all things, that is to ſay, to haue attempted fewer enterpriſes, to haue feared more to offend God, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their ſubiects and neighbors ſo many ſundry waies aboue rehearſed, and to haue vſed honeſt pleaſures and recreation? Yes ſure. For by that meanes their liues ſhould haue been prolonged, diſeaſes ſhould not ſo ſoone haue aſſailed them, their death ſhould haue been more lamented, and leſſe deſired; yea, and they ſhould haue had leſſe cauſe to feare death. What goodlier examples can we finde to teach vs that man is but a ſhadowe, that our life is miſerable and ſhort, and that we are nothing, neither great nor ſmall? For immediately after our death, all men abhorre and loath our bodies, and ſo ſoone as the ſoule is ſeuered from the body, it goeth to receiue iudgement; yea vndoubtedly at the very inſtant that the ſoule and body part, the iudgement of God is giuen according to our merits and deſerts, which is the particular iudgement of God.</p>

The King his father had brought him vp at Amboiſe in ſuch ſolitarines, that none beſides his ordinarie ſeruants could haue acceſſe vnto him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther permitted he him to learne any more Latine than this one ſentence: <hi>He that cannot diſſemble cannot raigne:</hi> which he did not for that he hated learning, but bicauſe he feared that ſtudie would hurt the tender and delicate complexion of the childe.

                  <p>Before the Kings coronation, the Princes of the blood and the nobles of the realme, who ſo often had beene iniuried in the late King <hi>Levvis</hi> his time by <hi>Oliuer le Dain</hi> his barber, by <hi>Daniell</hi> a Flemming the ſaid <hi>Oliuers</hi> ſeruant, and by <hi>Iohn D'oyac;</hi> (which three had wholie gouerned the ſaid King <hi>Levvis,)</hi> cauſed informations ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to be exhibited againſt them for diuers murthers, rapines, and other heinous crimes that they had committed in King <hi>Levvis</hi> his time, yea and ſome of them by his commandement: the which informations being ſeene by the court Parlament, they were foorthwith apprehended, their proceſſe made, and in the end all three condemned: and the next yeere being 1484. the ſaid <hi>Oliuer</hi> and <hi>Daniell</hi> his man were hanged at Paris, and <hi>D'oyac</hi> had his eares cut off, and his toong bored through with a hot iron. One of the crimes committed by <hi>Oliuer</hi> and <hi>Daniell,</hi> for the which they were executed was this: A gentleman was committed to priſon by King <hi>Levvis</hi> his commandement, whoſe wife being yoong and beutifull, was contented to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don hir ſelfe to the luſt of this <hi>Oliuer,</hi> vpon promiſe that he ſhould deliuer hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band out of priſon to hir; but the next day he cauſed <hi>Daniell</hi> his man to put him into a ſacke, and to throwe him into the riuer, where he was miſerably drowned.

In this aſſembly it was enacted that there ſhould be no Regent in Fraunce; but that <hi>Anne</hi> Lady of Beauieu the Kings eldeſt ſiſter ſhould haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of his roiall perſon, according to the teſtament of King <hi>Levvis</hi> the 11. that the priuy Councell ſhould conſiſt of twelue choſen out of the body of the Nobility, by whoſe aduiſe all matters ſhould be gouerned and diſpatched; but all in the Kings name, and vnder the ſignature of his hand.

                  <p>But <hi>Levvis</hi> Duke of Orleance being the neereſt Prince of the blood royall, by the perſwaſion of thoſe that were about him, who gaped for great preferment if the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment were committed to his charge, and eſpecially by the inſtigation of the Earle of Dunois named <hi>Francis,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Iohn</hi> commonly called the Baſtard of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance, (a man of a ſubtile ſpirit, and of great enterpriſe) abode ſtill at Paris, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered daily into the councell, (notwithſtanding the decree of the three eſtates,) as one that would vnderſtand of all that was done there.

in Fraunce (as heerafter ſhall be declared) vnderſtood; they came to the ſaid Lady of Beauieu, and offered hir and the King their ſeruice, which the Duke of Orleance greatly ſtomached. Further, the ſaid Duke ſought by all meanes poſſible to diſcredit the womaniſh gouernment of the ſaid Lady; but his perſwaſions little preuailed, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Duke himſelfe being not as yet fower and twenty yeeres old, was vnder the gouernment of his mother, and it ſeemed no reaſon to commit the managing of the common wealth to him that was vnable to gouerne his owne priuate eſtate: ſo that the ſame reaſon barred him from the gouernment now, that excluded his grandfather in times paſt, during the phrenſie of King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt. But this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſatisfied not the Duke nor his friends. Wherefore the Lady of Beauieu ſeeing that the Duke of Orleance remaining in Paris, wan daily thoſe that were in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to his ſide: ſeeking by that meanes to obtaine the regencie of the realme: ſent by the reſolution of the Kings councell, certaine to Paris to arreſt the body of the ſaid Duke. Who being aduertiſed therof as he was at tenice, withdrew himſelfe, and (pretending that he went to his lodging) departed in the company of <hi>Guyot Pot,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> of Louen (one of the gentlemen of his chamber whom he greatly fauoured) &amp; lodged that night at Pontoiſe. The next day he went to Vernueil, and from thence to Alençon, where he remained a certaine ſpace: during the which, he practiſed to draw to his partie the Earle of Angouleſme, the Duke of Bourbon, and the Lord of Alebret, who in the end declared themſelues to be his friends and aſſiſtants in this enterpriſe. But all theſe bicauſe of this their confederacie with him, were foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with remooued from all their offices and eſtates, and loſt al their penſions, and their charge of men of armes: yet notwithſtanding, they leuied a great army of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their countries, and found meanes to win to their ſide the Duke of Lorraine, the Prince of Orenge, and the Earle of Foix. Vnder the aſſurance of all the which Princes, the D. of Orleance aſſembled his army at Blois, to marche therewith to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance: but the citizens of the towne perceiuing that their Duke came thither with a purpoſe to ſuppriſe it, and to make it the ſeate of the wars, ſhut their gates vpon him, and would not ſuffer him to enter in. Wherefore with an army of fower hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred launces, and a great number of footemen, he went to Bougencie, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Earles of Dunois and Foix, an with Carqueleuant, and other French captaines, where they remained a certaine ſpace, and thither the King ſent to beſiege them. But bicauſe they ſawe the place not to be of defence; and further, that the Malcontents of the realme flocked not to them as they ſuppoſed they would: they made a ſudden peace with the King, whereby it was agreed, that the Duke of Orleance ſhould repaire to the King, and ſo he did, and that the Earle of Dunois the contriuer of all this enterpriſe ſhould depart the realme, which alſo he did and retired himſelfe to Aſt. But this notwithſtanding, the Duke of Bourbon and the Earle of Angouleſme, who had leuied their armies to ſuccor the Duke of Orleance, marched toward Bourges, whither the King went with a great army, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Duke of Orleance, who was conſtrained to arme himſelfe againſt his allies and confederates. Notwithſtanding by the wiſedome of the Marſhall of Gie and the Lord of Grauille (which two had great authoritie in the Court vnder the Lady of Beauieu,) peace was concluded betweene the King and his nobles, wherein the Lord of Albret was alſo comprehended; and thus departed all theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without any bloodſhed, and the K. went to Amboiſe; the Duke of Orleance to Orleance; and the Earle of Foix and the Cardinall his brother to Nantes to the Duke of Britaine who had married their ſiſter.

After al this, the Earle of Dunois returned from Aſt, and went to his owne towne of Partenay in Poitou, which was then a ſtrong towne with a double ditch, and a triple wall.

And after three or fower meſſengers, the laſt whereof was the Marſhall of Gié, the Duke of Orleans went to Blois, and the next day being twelfe euen in the ſaid yeere 1485. he departed out of Blois early in the morning with his haukes, faining that he went to flie in the <note place="margin">

This was the Duke of Orleans ſecond comming into Britaine, as by that which followeth heerafter ſhall more plainly appeere. The King being aduertiſed of his departure, determined to beſiege the Earle of Dunois in his towne of Partenay, and found meanes (before any brute was made thereof) to drawe to his ſeruice the Marſhall of Rieux, and the other Barons of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that were then retired to Chaſteaubrian to the Lady of Laual, who was Lady thereof, bicauſe the Duke of Britaine by aide of the Duke of Orleans and the Earle of Dunois ſought to auenge himſelfe of the ſaid Barons, for the death of <hi>Peter Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> Treaſurer of Britaine, whereof I will now begin to ſpeake.</p>

But preſently a great vprore began in the towne: for one of the Dukes ſeruants, at the noble mens firſt entrie into the caſtell, being let downe the caſtell wall by a rope, made a great outcrie in the towne, aggrauating the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the fact, and affirming that the caſtell was forced, the Duke aſſaulted, and his life in great danger vnles he were ſpeedily ſuccoured. The citizens (ignorant that this attempt was made onely for the ſurpriſing of <hi>Peter Landois)</hi> armed themſelues, and ran to the caſtell threatning all the nobilitie with death, of whom not one durſt ſhew himſelfe vpon the wall to ſpeake to the furious multitude, bicauſe the people had planted ſhot againſt the caſtell, meaning to ſpare no man ſo ſoone as he ſhould appeere, but the Duke alone. The Duke being in the hands of his nobles, ſhewed himſelfe vnto his people, who preſently kneeled downe before him, congratulating with him for his ſafetie, and ſo the tumult ceaſed.</p>
                  <p>But the nobilitie for this bold attempt were baniſhed, though their liues were pardoned, who preſently retired themſelues into Fraunce to King <hi>Charles,</hi> as before you haue heard. Then <hi>Peter</hi> recouered his former credit with the Duke, and cauſed him to write to the Duke of Orleans his coſin germaine, that it would pleaſe him to come to him into Britaine; which the Duke of Orleans did by the perſwaſion of the Earle of Dunois, who ſought to diuorce him from the Kings ſiſter, and to marrie him with <hi>Anne</hi> the Duke of Britaines eldeſt daughter and heire, which alſo happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the ſaid Duke of Orleans was King, though it were not now accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. The Duke of Orleans accompanied with the Duke of Alençon arriued at Nantes, in the moneth of Aprill after this tumult, being the yeere 1484. where they were honorably receiued of the Duke of Britaine, who complained to them of the outrage done vnto him by the Prince of Orenge and the Marſhall of Rieux, for the reuenge whereof he deſired their aide, which they promiſed him in generall termes, and then departed to go to Reimes to the coronation of King <hi>Charles.</hi> After the which the Duke of Orleans fell at variance with the King, and yet in the end peace was concluded betweene them in the yeere 1485. as before you haue heard.</p>

For the execution whereof an armie was leuied in the Dukes name to raſe Ancenix, where the Prince of Orenge and the Earle of Comminges then remained, who being aduertiſed therof, by the aide of their friends and of the baniſhed Barons that were returned out of exile to defend their patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, leuied likewiſe an armie to withſtand <hi>Landois</hi> attempts: but when thoſe two armies were come the one in face of the other, the remembrance and loue to their common countrie altered their mindes in ſuch ſort, that they diſarmed themſelues, and each imbraced other as friends. Then went the Prince of Orenge and the Earle of Comminges to the Duke, and recouered his fauour and the gouernment: by meanes whereof all the ſtorme fell vpon <hi>Peter Landois</hi> alone, whom when the nobles knew to be within the caſtell, with one conſent they went thither, being fully reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſeize vpon him, though he were in the Dukes armes. Then one whom both the nobilitie and commons had by common conſent choſen their new Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, by their conſtraint ſpake to the Duke, and aduertiſed him that without the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of <hi>Peter</hi> the tumult could not be appeaſed, againſt whom they would proceede onely by order of lawe, without executing any thing vpon him before his cauſe were

heard and throughly examined. Thus was he yeelded into their hands, and preſently impriſoned, and for faſhions ſake examined: many hainous crimes were obiected againſt him. To conclude, he was condemned and hanged before the Duke knew his cauſe to be tried, who was purpoſed to haue granted him his pardon, howſoeuer law proceeded againſt him: for the preuenting whereof the execution was haſtened. But this fact of the nobilitie (which the Duke accounted as a moſt hainous iniurie done to himſelfe) made them ten times more odious to the Duke than they were before. The Duke created a new Chauncellor, and to make head againſt his nobles receiued very curteouſly the Duke of Orleans, who about this preſent fled to him out of Fraunce with a great company of his partakers: which when the ſaid nobles of Britaine ſawe, they were greatly aſtonied, and fled for feare the ſecond time into Fraunce, where the King (meaning to make war vpon the Duke of Britaine, for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Duke of Orleans being fled from him) welcommed them, and entred into league with them, as in the end of the laſt chapter you haue heard.

This armie inuaded Britaine three ſeuerall waies; for the <note place="margin">1486</note> Lord of Saint André with fower hundred launces, and fiue or ſixe thouſand foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men entred on one ſide; the Earle of Montpenſier with a great band vpon another ſide, and <hi>Lewis</hi> of Trimouille Vicount of Touars, (who had married <hi>Gabriell</hi> of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon the ſaid Earle of Montpenſiers ſiſter) vpon the third, in ſuch ſort that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Britaine was couered with French ſoldiers, with whom alſo the barons of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine aboue mentioned, were ioined, who cauſed diuers caſtels in Britaine to be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Kings armie by thoſe that were of their faction: whereat the Duke of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine was greatly aſtonied.

yet that notwithſtanding the Duke of Britaine leauing Nantes in the hands of his coſin the Prince of Orenge, retired himſelfe to the caſtell of Maleſtroit, being a ſtrong place, where he leuied an armie of ſixe hundred launces, and 16000. footemen to ſuccour Ploermel (diſtant three or fower leagues from Maleſtroit) which the Kings armie then beſieged. But as this Britaine armie marched thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, one of the company brake foorth into theſe ſpeeches, and asked what this war meant, and what was the end thereof, alleaging that their Duke was wholy gouerned by the French, and that the French made the Britaines at their pleaſure to reuenge French quarrels vpon the French: wherefore he perſwaded them to returne home to their wiues and children, and not to ſpend their liues for other mens quarrels. Whereupon all the armie diſparkled, and returned home: by meanes whereof Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermel ſeeing no hope of ſuccours yeelded by compoſition, and yet notwithſtanding was ſpoiled, and the rich men taken priſoners, and put to raunſome. The Dukes of Britaine and Orleans, and the other Lords that were with them at Maleſtroit, being aduertiſed of the departure of their armie, and of the taking of Ploermel, went to Vennes vpon Whitſon euen being the yeere 1487. whither the Kings armie ſo ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily followed them, that hardly they eſcaped by ſea, and went to Croiſick, and from thence by the riuer of Loire to Nantes, being conſtrained to leaue part of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage <note place="margin">1487</note> in the ſaid towne of Vennes, which preſently after their departure yeelded without any reſiſtance. Further, not long after the taking of this towne, the French in a skirmiſh at a place called Ioue betweene Chaſteaubrian and Nantes, defeated a great band of Britaines, led by <hi>Amaulry</hi> of la Moſſay towards Nantes, at the which time the King in perſon lay at Ancenix. After the taking of Vennes the Kings armie marched to Nantes, and laid the ſiege before the towne the 19. day of Iune in the ſaid yeere 1487. Within the towne were the Duke of Britaine and his two daughters <hi>Anne</hi> and <hi>Iſabell,</hi> the Duke of Orleans, the Prince of Orenge, the Lady of Lauall and of Chaſteaubrian, the Biſhop of Nantes called <hi>du Chaffault,</hi> a man of holy life, the Earle of Comminges, and diuers other Lords: all the which diſlodged out of the caſtell, and lodged in the towne. And bicauſe the companie had ſome ielouſie of the ſaid biſhop of Nantes, and the Lady of Lauall that they were not thoroughly to be truſted: they were put in garde into certaine of the townes mens hands. At this ſiege were ten thouſand French men, and great ſtore of artillerie, wherewith the wals, towers, and vaumures of the caſtell and towne were throughly battered; but they without were as well plied by them within, both with ſhot and with ſalies of valiant men, where many a goodly feate of armes was done, both on the one ſide and the other. Further, you ſhall vnderſtand, that the Earle of Dunois being in baſe Britaine there to embarke towards England to haue aide from thence, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that the winde would not ſuffer him ſo to do, brought with him to ſuccour the towne of Nantes aboue fiftie thouſand of the commons of Britaine, which the French ſuffered to paſſe, ſuppoſing them not to be men of ſeruice. But the King ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extreme heate of the weather, and perceiuing that he could do no good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the towne, leuied his ſiege the ſixt day of Auguſt, and departed. Then marched the Kings armie before the towne of Dolle, which they tooke without reſiſtance and ſpoiled, and all the Britaines and ſoldiers that were within it were taken priſoners. Further, the Kings armie ſpoiled all the countrie, ſlue the people, and draue away their cattell. But the Marſhall of Rieux and the greateſt part of the baniſhed nobles of Britaine that were in the Kings ſeruice, lamenting the miſerable eſtate of their country, waxed wearie of the wars, and alleaged that their league with the King was onely to this end, that they might recouer their countrie, and the French that liued
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7649:137"/>
in Britaine be conſtrained to returne home into theirs. Wherfore ſeeing the French nobles being in Britaine proteſted, that they would willingly returne home if the King would pardon their departure to the Duke; and that the Duke on the other ſide, with the conſent of all his ſubiects, had offered theſe baniſhed nobles of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pardon, and reſtitution to all their goods and lands, they ſawe no cauſe why the wars ſhould endure, but that each partie ſhould returne home in peace: but the French, and diuers alſo of the Britaines themſelues were little mooued with theſe allegations. Wherefore the ſaid Marſhal being Lord of Ancenix, a towne very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for the maintenance of the Kings wars, and the which (notwithſtanding that he held it for the King) he had manned with his owne tenants and ſeruants: yeelded the place to the Duke of Britaine, and ſware the townes men to be true to him. And further, before the fame of his reuolt was ſpred abrode, he went with a great companie to Chaſteaubrian, which was alſo held for the King, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the towne as a friend, he placed a garriſon of his owne ſoldiers in it, and baniſhed all that refuſed to returne to the obedience of the Duke. From thence he went and laid the ſiege before Vennes the 25. day of Februarie, which was held by <note place="margin">

                  <p>On the other ſide the Kings army ſlept not: for Ancenix they tooke by aſſault, and raſed the wals, towers, and houſes by the Kings commandement, ſo that one ſtone was not left vpon another, which the King did in ſpite of the Marſhall of Rieux, whoſe the towne was, and who was newly reuolted from him as you haue heard. Chaſteaubrian was alſo recouered by the Kings forces, and the caſtell raſed. From thence the Kings army marched to Frougiers, being a frontier towne ſtronge and of good reſiſtance, and laid the ſiege before the place, whereupon the Duke of Britaine being ſtroken with a new feare, determined to ſend the Earle of Dunois in ambaſſage to the King, whereof heereafter you ſhall heare.</p>
                  <p>About this time being the beginning of the yeere 1488. the Lord of Albret who long had been reſident in the Court of Spaine, came by ſea and landed in baſe Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine with fower thouſand men of war: his men went to Rennes, but himſelfe to Nantes to the Duke of Britaine, where at his firſt comming he demanded to haue the marriage between him and the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> the Dukes eldeſt daughter accompliſhed.

to Angiers to the King, to vnderſtand what the King demanded in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of Britaine, and why he deſtroied the caſtels and townes thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of Britaine as aboue is mentioned, being in great feare when he ſawe the Kings army before Fougieres, ſent the Earle of Dunois with the conſent of his nobles in ambaſſage to Angiers to the K. The ſaid Earle in his iourney thitherward, ſo preached in all places the great commodities that concord and peace bring with them, that all mens eies were fixed vpon him. When he came to the K. being then eighteene yeeres of age, he very eloquently pleaded the cauſe of the Duke of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and of the other French noble men that were retired to him, alleaging that the Duke being worne with yeeres, conſumed with diſeaſes, hauing buried his wife, being deſtitute of iſſue male, his eldeſt daughter being hardly twelue yeeres of age, and his yoonger leſſe; and laſtly, being forſaken of his nobilitie for the hatred they bare to <hi>Peter Landois,</hi> and not for any euill deſert of his owne, began to languiſh in ſorow and griefe: for the which cauſe the noble men of Fraunce that were of kin &amp; alied to him, being mooued with very naturall affection, were retired to him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him in this diſtreſſe. Among whom, none were neerer to him (his owne children excepted) than the Duke of Orleans, and the Prince of Orenge, the one being his vncles ſonne, the other his ſiſters, and that theſe and others his neere kinſemen were yet with him, onely to this end; adding that the Duke was not to be accuſed bicauſe he forbad them not his countries, when they came to comfort him in his miſeries, or they for comming to relieue him in his diſtreſſe. But quoth he, it will be obiected that there are beſides theſe, diuers others with him of the nobilitie of Fraunce, that haue leuied war againſt the King: but what war? Forſooth, as the Britaines marched with force to leuy the ſiege of Ploermel, being aduertiſed that they could not ſo do without a battell with the French: the reuerence they bare to the Kings Maieſtie was ſuch, that willingly they gaue place, and forbare to fight, and rather ſuffered their townes to be taken and ſpoiled, than they would encounter with the Kings troupes. Further ſo ſoone as the D. vnderſtood the K. deſire to be, that the baniſhed Nobles of Britain ſhould return home, he foorthwith receiued them into his fauor, and reſtored them to their former eſtate. What offence then (ſaid he) hath the Duke made? What cauſe of war againſt him? Truly none. But on the contrary ſide many cauſes of commiſeration, and many cauſes why the King ſhould grant the Duke of Britaine peace. This was the effect of the ſpeech he was commanded (as he ſaid) to deliuer to the K. which charge he would not haue taken vpon him, but that he knew the D. of Britaine to carie a minde ſingularly well affected to the Kings Maieſtie, and the French nobles that were in Britaine to be the Kings deuout ſeruants &amp; ſubiects, and ready to ſhed their blood for the defence of him and his eſtate. This the Earles ſpeech mooued the King to incline to peace, whereof the treatie was already begun, when the ſudden report of a batel wherof you ſhal now heare as ſuddenly brak it off.</p>

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7649:138"/>
noble men of Britaine fearing the loſſe of the towne, departed from Nantes and went to Rennes, where they aſſembled their forces to leuy the ſiege. Their men of armes were fower hundred, and their footemen of their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries twelue thouſande, as ſome write; as others, but eight thouſand, beſides three hundred Engliſh men, and eight hundred Swiſſers, and of artillerie they had great plentie. Then in very good order they encamped abroad in the fields. The names of the noble men of the armie were theſe: the D. of Orleans, the Lord of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret, the Marſhall of Rieux, the Lord of Chaſteaubrian, the Lord of Scales an Engliſhman, the Lord of Leon, the Lord of Rohans eldeſt ſonne, the Lord of Crenettes, the Lord of Pont l'Abbe, the Lord of Pleſſis, the Lord of Balynes, the Lord of Montigny, the Lord of Montuet: all the which Lords with their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies &amp; whole forces encamped at a village called Andouille, the wedneſday being the 23. of Iuly, the yeere 1488. aboue mentioned: in the night there was an alarme among the Gaſcoins, whereof it was feared ſome quarrell would haue growen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Duke of Orleans and the Lord of Alebret, but the matter was ſoone pacified. In the mean time came newes to theſe Lords at the ſaid village of Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uille the ſaterday the ſixe and twenty of the ſaid moneth of Iuly, that the French had taken Fongieres by compoſition, with theſe conditions, that the ſoldiers ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in ſafety with bag and baggage: vpon which newes the Britains army determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to march to Saint Albin, hoping eaſily to take the towne bicauſe the French garriſon within it was but ſmall, and that in the meane time the ſoldiers that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of Fongieres, ſhould ioine with them and increaſe their forces. On the other ſide the French army marched alſo towards Saint Albin meaning to be there before the Britains; but it ſo fell out that neither of them entered the towne, bicauſe before they came thither they met &amp; fought. For you ſhall vnderſtand that the ſame ſaterday that the Britains receiued newes of the taking of Fongieres, they marched to a village called Orenge two leagues from Saint Albin, where they were aduertiſed that the Kings army marched againſt them with a ful reſolution to fight with them.</p>
                  <p>The ſunday morning the Britaines conſulted of the order of their battell, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the footemen were iealous of the French horſemen that were in their campe, and namely of the Duke of Orleans himſelfe: it was thought good that he and the Prince of Orenge ſhould leaue their horſes, and put themſelues on foote in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell among the Swiſſers, and ſo they did. The vaward was lead by the Marſhall of Rieux, the battel by the Lord of Alebret, and the rereward by the Lord of Chaſteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brian: vpon one of their wings was placed their artillerie and their carriage. And the more to terrifie the French with the great number of Engliſh men, whereas there were in truth but three hundred Engliſh men lead by the Lord Talbot, ſeauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Britain footemen were ioined to them, armed with iacks and red croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s Engliſh like: and the monday morning they raunged themſelues in battell in this order aboue rehearſed, hard by a groue of wood attending the French army. The Kings army (whereof Maſter <hi>Lewis</hi> of Trimouille Vicount of Touars, being fiue or ſixe and twenty yeeres of age, was generall,) departed out of Fongieres with a full reſolution to fight with the Britains. The vaward was lead by <hi>Adrian de l'hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> and <hi>Gabriell</hi> of Montfalzoys: before the which, ten or twelue valiant French knights aduanced themſelues to diſcouer the Britains actions, whoſe good order when they had viewed, they retired to their company, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being in troupe al cloſe ioined togither approched the Britaines army, the artillerie in the meane time play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on both ſides, and greatly endammaging both the parties. The French marched very couragiouſly, and charged the Britaines vawarde, where the Marſhall of Rieux
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7649:138"/>
valiantly receiued them, and acquit himſelfe ſo well both he and his companie, that the French left the vaward, &amp; marched ſtraight vpon the Britaines battell, where the Britaine horſemen recoiled, by meanes whereof their rereward being diſcouraged fled. Then the French purſued them, and ſlue all the footemen they could ouertake: which diſorder when the Britaine vaward perceiued, they alſo diſparkled and ſought to ſaue themſelues. To conclude, the French obtained the victorie, and ſlue all thoſe that bare the red croſſe, ſuppoſing they had beene all Engliſh men, togither with twelue or thirteene hundred Britaines as well horſemen as footemen. The Duke of Orleans was taken by the footemen, and likewiſe the Prince of Orenge, who had pulled away his blacke croſſe from him, and had laid himſelfe flat vpon the ground among the dead bodies, faining himſelfe to be ſlaine; but he was knowen by a French archer, and both he and the Duke of Orleans led priſoners to Saint Albin vnder ſure garde. The Lord of Alebret ſeeing all ouerthrowen, fled away and eſcaped. The Marſhall of Rieux alſo ſaued himſelfe, and retired to Dinan. The Lord of Leon, the Lord <hi>du Pont l'Abbe,</hi> the Lord of Montfort, and diuers other noble men of Britaine were ſlaine; and of other ſoldiers to the number of ſixe thouſand: of the Kings part was ſlaine <hi>Iames Galeot</hi> a valiant and a renowmed captaine, and to the number of a thouſand or twelue hundred common ſoldiers. This battell was fought vpon mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 28. of Iuly the yeere 1488. Soone after the Duke of Orleans was led to the caſtell of Luzignen, and from thence to Poictiers, where he remained a certaine ſpace, and laſtly to the great tower of Bourges.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond day after the battell, the Lord of Trimouille ſent certaine heraults to Reims to ſummon the towne to yeeld to the King: who after conſultation had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſaid heraults, that the King had no right to the towne, and that wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and without cauſe he made war vpon the countrie of Britaine, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his great armie, he could not ouerrun the countrie as he hoped: for God who defended the Britaines right, was able to do as much to him as he did to King <hi>Iohn</hi> before Poictiers, and to King <hi>Philip</hi> of Valois at Crecy: adding further, that they would not yeeld the towne, and that if Monſeur <hi>de la Trimouille</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſhould finde fortie thouſand men in the towne, whereof twenty thouſand were men of defence. This anſwer was reported to the ſaid <hi>Trimouille,</hi> who ſtaied a long time without replying one word thereunto, and afterwards by the ſame he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raults aduertiſed the King thereof being at Angiers. Whereupon the King aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his Councell to determine what was to be done in this caſe. Some, yea almoſt all were of opinion that the towne ſhould be beſieged: but Maſter <hi>VVilliam</hi> of Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Chauncellor of Fraunce held the contrarie opinion, grounding himſelfe vpon the Kings title to the ſaid Duchie of Britaine, which was ſaid to grow by means of a certaine conueiance that Maſter <hi>Iohn</hi> of Broſſe Lord of Bouſſac husband to dame <hi>Nicole</hi> of Britaine, daughter and heire to <hi>Charles</hi> of Blois Earle of Ponthieure, had made to the Kings anceſtors, togither with diuers other titles, which were not yet prooued good: adding; that if the King had no right thereunto, it ſhould be a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and a tyrannous act to vſurpe another mans countrie that appertained not to him. Wherefore his aduice was, that according to the requeſt of the ambaſſadors of Britaine being at Angiers, certaine graue and learned men ſhould be appointed to examine the right of both ſides. This opinion tooke place, and according thereunto the King agreed with the ambaſſadors of Britaine, that both he and the Duke would appoint ſome graue men of their Councell, who ſhould meete in ſome indifferent towne, with the charters and writings of both ſides, to determine in conſcience to whom the ſaid Duchie did appertaine; and that in the meane time the King ſhould
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7649:139"/>
hold all the places in the ſaid Duchie that alreadie he poſſeſſed. The Duke of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine liked this agreement well, and bicauſe the plague was vehement at Nantes, he departed thence with his two daughters, the Ladie of Laval, the Lord of Alebret, the Earle of Dunoys, the Marſhall of Rieux, the Earle of Comminges, and diuers other Lords, to Coiron vpon the riuer of Loyer three leagues beneath Nantes; where ſoone after namely vpon wedneſday the ſeauenth of September in the ſame yeere 1488. he ended his life thorow a ſicknes which he got by a fall, leauing the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment both of his Duchie of Britaine, and of his two daughters to the Marſhall of Rieux, to whom he appointed the Earle of Comminges for aſſiſtant. His body was carried to Nantes and buried in the Church of the Carmelites.</p>

Neither was the King of Fraunce ignorant of this treatie, but knew right well that ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors had paſſed to and fro betweene <hi>Maximilian</hi> and them, ſo far foorth that the ſaid <hi>Maximilian</hi> ſuppoſing al matters to be throughly concluded and agreed on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to imbrace al Britaine in his minde, and thought no enterpriſe too high for him if to his low countries obtained by his firſt marriage, he could now ioine the Duchy of Britaine by his ſecond. Great conſultation was had in Fraunce how to repulſe this terrible ſtorme, but <hi>Maximilians</hi> owne ſlacknes moſt furthered their deuiſes. The K. councell in the end reſolued that the King ſhould refuſe his wife being <hi>Maximilians</hi> daughter, and ſeeke with all expedition the marriage of the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> of Britaine, alleaging that the neighborhood of ſo mightie a Prince as <hi>Maximilian</hi> was, could not be but dangerous to his eſtate, of whom he could hope for nothing but diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled friendſhip preſently, and aſſured war in time to come, conſidering that the ſaid <hi>Maximilian</hi> forgetting already his league and affinitie with the King, ſtirred vp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually one war after another againſt him, and by that meanes profeſſed himſelfe an open enimy to him and his realme. Wherefore ambaſſadors were preſently ſent to treate of this marriage with the Lady <hi>Anne.</hi> She at the firſt woondered at the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and alleaged that ſhe had giuen hir faith to <hi>Maximilian,</hi> which ſhe might not breake: and further, that ſhe had beene ſolemnly married to him (according to the accuſtomed maner of Princes) by <hi>VVolfgangus Poleme</hi> of Auſtrich his proctor, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely ſent by him into Britaine to that end. But the Lady of Lauat and other noble women of Britaine, whoſe company and familiarity this yoong Princes vſed and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7649:139"/>
greatly delighted in, being corrupted with French rewards and promiſes, perſwaded hir that this French match ſhould be moſt for hir ſafety and auancement; alleaging that if ſhe married with <hi>Maximilian</hi> he ſhould hardly be able to defend Britaine, whereof already they had good proofe, conſidering that he had euer diſappointed them of the ſuccors he had promiſed to ſend them. And as touching hir ſcruple of conſcience, they ſaid that the Pope who had power ouer all lawes Eccleſiaſticall, would eaſily be brought to diſpence therwith, the rather bicauſe this match ſhould be beſt for hir ſafety, and for the preſeruation of hir eſtate. The yoong Princeſſe though ſhe were of a ſingular wit and rare vertues, yet being vanquiſhed by theſe perſwaſions, yeelded to their requeſt, and deliuered both hirſelfe and hir countrey into the Kings hands, and ſoone after was the marriage ſolemnly accompliſhed to the great reioicing of the French. And thus receiued Britaine the French yoake, to the great griefe of all the ſubiects, who deſired to be gouerned by a particular Duke of their owne, as they had euer been in times paſt.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this marriage, the Earle of Dunois who had been the principall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the peace, &amp; a great furtherer of the mariage, &amp; therby throughly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the K. ſuddenly died as he was on horſebacke for want of meat as it was ſaid.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Maximilian</hi> was forewarned of al theſe French practiſes, and ſeemed to make no account of them; but when he perceiued this marriage to be accompliſhed, it dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his hatred againſt the King, ſo far foorth, that he openly railed vpon him and vowed himſelfe to deſtroy France with fire and ſword, and preſently inuaded Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie.

When all things were in a readines, and the gates being ſo negligently guarded, that the traitors with their counterfaited keies had opened them, they began a ſong, whereby they willed the enimies to make haſte, who preſently repaired to the gates, and were receiued into the towne. <hi>Paul Carqueleuant</hi> a Briton, gouernor of the townein the abſence of the baſtard of Cardonne, at the enimies firſt entrie retired himſelfe with his ſoldiers into the caſtel; but fearing leaſt it ſhould be taken by aſſault, he ſoone abandoned it, greatly to his reproch: for if he had held it but till the next day, diuers French bands had come thither to his reliefe. The towne was ſpoiled, and many ſlaine, neither were the churches ſpared nor the traitors houſes. The author of this treaſon was a poore ſmith that dwelled vpon the towne wall, and had beene the onely man that was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to remaine in the towne by <hi>Levvis</hi> the eleuenth, when he tranſported the townes men as a colonie into Fraunce. <hi>Carqueleuant</hi> the gouernor, when the towne was ſurpriſed lay faſt a ſleepe, drowned in drinke and good cheere as it is ſaid. The towne was ſpoiled by the ſoldiers bicauſe <hi>Maximilian</hi> was behinde with them for certaine moneths paie. Saint Omers was alſo taken at the ſame time, though ſome refer it to an other time, but whenſoeuer it was taken, this is moſt certaine that the negligence of the watch was the loſſe thereof. For the enimies being led by <hi>George Deberfin</hi> made ſhew at their firſt comming before the towne, as though they would haue ſcaled it, at which time the French ſoldiers were ready to withſtand them vpon the wals, being ſtrong and very defenſible both by nature and by Arte: whereupon the enimies vnder pretence of feare, retired into their campe; yea and further, when the French iſſued foorth to skirmiſh with them, they euer retired faining the like feare, which diſſimulation they vſed by the ſpace of eight daies, and by this their pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, cauſed the French to remit much of their accuſtomed induſtry and diligence: which when the Burgundians and Almaines perceiued, they with great expedition reared ladders againſt the wals and bulwarks of the town, which they eaſily entered, the watch being faſt a ſleepe, and in ſome place no watch at all. Then brake they open the gates, ſlew the French ſoldiers and the citizens, and ſo became Maſters of the towne.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time was Amiens alſo attempted by the Burgundians in the night, and like to haue been ſurpriſed by the like negligence of the watch: but <hi>Katherine de Liques</hi> (a woman of a manlike courage) awaked the watch out of their dead ſleepe, by meanes whereof the alarme was ſounded, and all the towne aroſe in armes, and part went to defend the wals, and the reſt iſſued foorth and skirmiſhed, and put to flight <hi>Maximilians</hi> bands, who plainly confeſſed that the diligence and induſtrie of one woman had wrong the victory out of their hands.</p>

But the nobles of Fraunce would not condeſcend to this reſtitution, bicauſe the two Counties were a rampier for the realme on that ſide towards Spaine: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they were not engaged to King <hi>Lewis,</hi> but abſoulutely ſolde. And notwithſtanding that the King of Spaine alleaged that King <hi>Lewis</hi> by his laſt will and Teſtament had commanded the ſaid Counties to be reſtored, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were wrongfully withheld: yet his perſwaſions and allegations little auailed. Wherefore he perceiuing that this way no good would be done, fell to practiſe with men of religion, hoping by their preaching of conſcience to King <hi>Charles</hi> to win that of him that otherwiſe he ſaw no meanes to obtaine. Wherefore he corrupted with a great ſumme of mony <hi>Oliuer Maillard,</hi> or as others write <hi>Iohn de Mauleon,</hi> a frier Franciſcane, confeſſor to the Lady of Beauieu the Kings ſiſter, who vnder his coule of religion cloking his hypocriſie and couetouſnes, perſwaded hir, that except reſtitution were made of theſe territories to the King of Spaine, the King hir brothers gouerment could not proſper nor pleaſe God. She being mooued in conſcience by this friers perſwaſions, brake this matter to <hi>Lewis</hi> of Amboiſe biſhop of Alby, the Kings ſchoolmaſter, who togither with hir ſo terrified the Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that he did not onely make reſtitution of the ſaid territories by the hands of the ſaid biſhop, whom he ſent thither to deliuer them: but alſo freely releaſed to the King of Arragon all the money that King <hi>Levvis</hi> his father had paid for them; with theſe conditions, that the ſaid King of Arragon and his ſucceſſors, ſhould euer after loue and honor the realme of Fraunce, that he ſhould make no war againſt it, nor aide with money, victuals, or councell any of the enimies thereof, nor permit them to haue paſſage through his dominions. And thus were theſe countries reſtored, greatly to the French mens griefe and dammage; but in truth the King the rather inclined to reſtore them, bicauſe hee began already by the perſwaſion of thoſe that were about him to phanſie a voiage into Italie, for the recouerie of the realme of Naples, which afterward tooke effect, though the King both now &amp; long after this, kept his purpoſe ſecret to himſelfe, and one or two more, which voiage I thinke was the principall cauſe that induced him to reſtore the foreſaid countries, thereby to tie the King of Spaine to him, that he ſhould not trouble him in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe; but he miſreckoned himſelfe, for he was no ſooner paſt the mountaines, but the King of Spaine forgot all his kindnes, and fell to practiſe a league with his enimies.</p>

And thus the King being in peace with all his neighbours: namely, with the Emperor and the Kings of England and Spaine, and poſſeſſing the Duchie of Britaine quietly by his mariage, and by that meanes hauing no body to feare, began wholie to diſpoſe himſelfe to his voiage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Italie, whereupon his minde was altogither fixed.</p>

The ſaid King departed from Vienna in Daulphine the 23. of Auguſt, the yeere 1494. and returned into his realme about October, the yeere 1495. Before the enterpriſe was fully reſolued on; the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was often debated whether he ſhould go or not: for the voiage ſeemed very dangerous to all men of wiſdome and experience, neither did any allow therof, but the King himſelfe, and one <hi>Stephen de Vers</hi> borne in Languedoc, a man of meane parentage, and vtterly vnacquainted with the wars, and all things thereunto appertaining. One other alſo being of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit was a furtherer thereof till his hart failed him, namely the generall <hi>Briſſonnet,</hi> who afterward by occaſion of this voiage, was preferred to many goodly dignities and ſpirituall promotions, and created a Cardinall. The former had already got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goodly poſſeſſions, for he was Seneſchall of Beaucaire, and preſident of the Comptes at Paris: he had ſerued the King in his youth very faithfully, being a groome of his chamber, and by his meanes the generall was woon to fauor this voiage; ſo that they two were the onely authors thereof; for the which, fewe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, but many blamed them: for all things neceſſarie for ſo great an enterpriſe were wanting. The King was yoong, a weake body, wedded to his owne will, ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied with wiſe men or good captaines, and ſo vtterly vnfurniſhed of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: that before his departure, he borrowed of the banke of Soly at Genua a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand franks vpon great entereſt, from Mart to Marte <ref target="#S5602.BK7.PROLOGUE.NOTE1">

                  </ref>. In diuers other places alſo he borrowed money as heereafter you ſhall heare. His army was vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided of tents and pauillions, and winter was begun when he entred into Lombardy. One onely good thing he had, to wit, a couragious company of yoong gentlemen: yet not in ſuch obedience as was requiſite. Wherefore we muſt of neceſſitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that this voiage was gouerned by God alone, both at our going foorth, and our returne home; for the wiſdome of the authors thereof aboue mentioned, ſerued to no great purpoſe: notwithſtanding they might iuſtly vaunt themſelues to be the occaſion of the great honor and renowme their Maſter wan thereby.</p>

               <p>One day they liued in hope, another in deſpaire; but their friends vſed great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in Italie, ſpecially at Milan, whereof <hi>Iohn Galeas</hi> was Duke, not the great <hi>Iohn Galeas</hi> that lieth buried in the Charterhouſe of Pauia, but he that was ſonne to Duke <hi>Galeas</hi> and the Ducheſſe <hi>Bonne</hi> daughter to the Duke of Sauoy, a man of no great ſenſe. The ſaid Ducheſſe had the wardſhip of hir children, and my ſelfe haue ſeen hir there in great authoritie, being a widow, and gouerned by one <hi>Cico</hi> a Secretarie, and an ancient ſeruant of that houſe.

But the third day after their returne, they tooke him notwithſtanding their oth, and caried him in an emptie caske through the town of Milan: he was allied by mariage to one of the Viſcomtes <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP2.NOTE3">

Thus was he led priſoner to the caſtle of Pauie where he died.</p>
               <p>They vſed this Lady very honorably in hir iudgement, ſeeking to content hir hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in all things; but all matters of importance they two diſpatched, making hir pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie but to what pleaſed them, and no greater pleaſure could they do hir, than to communicate nothing with hir.</p>
               <p>They permitted hir to giue this <hi>Anthony Theſin</hi> what ſhe would, they lodged him hard by hir chamber, he carried hir on horſebacke behinde him in the towne, and in hir houſe was nothing but feaſting and dauncing; but this iollitie endured but halfe a yeere.

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7649:145"/>
and made hir yeeld account thereof. Moreouer, they cauſed three keies therof to be made, one of the which ſhe kept, but the treaſure after that day ſhe neuer tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. They made hir alſo to ſurrender the wardſhip of hir children, and the ſaid <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douic</hi> was choſen their guardian.

               <p>In the meane time great variance aroſe between the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> of S. Seuerin, (for vſually two great men can not long agree:) but <hi>Lodouic</hi> wan the garland, &amp; the other departed to the Venetians ſeruice. Notwithſtanding, afterwards two of his ſonnes returned to the ſeruice of the ſaid <hi>Lodouic,</hi> and the ſtate of Milan, (namely Maſter <hi>Galeas,</hi> and the Earle of Caiazze) ſome ſay with their fathers conſent, others ſay no: but howſoeuer it were, the ſaid <hi>Lodouic</hi> highly fauored them, and both hath been and yet is very faithfully ſerued by them. You ſhall vnderſtand that their father the Lord <hi>Robert</hi> of Saint Seuerin was iſſued of a baſe daughter of the houſe of Saint Seuerin, but in Italie they make no difference betweene a baſtard and childe legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. This I write bicauſe they furthered our enterpriſe in Italy, aſwell in fauour of the Prince of Salerne chiefe of the ſaid houſe of Saint Seuerin, as alſo for diuers other reſpects, whereof heereafter you ſhall heare.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> declared immediately that he would by all meanes poſſible maintaine his authoritie, for he cauſed money to be coined, on the one ſide wherof the Dukes image was ſtamped, and on the other his own, whereat many murmured. This Duke was married to the daughter of <hi>Alfonſe</hi> Duke of Calabria, and King of Naples after his father King <hi>Ferrandes</hi> death. His ſaid wife was a Lady of a great courage, and would gladly haue increaſed hir husbands authority if ſhe could, but hir husband lacked wit, and diſcloſed all hir actions. The captaine alſo of the rocke of Milan continued long in great authoritie, and neuer departed out of the place; for many iealouſies were now ariſen, ſo far foorth that when one of the children went abroad, the other abode within. To be ſhort, a yeere or two before we entred into Italy, the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> hauing been abroad with the Duke, and purpoſing ſome miſchiefe, waited vpon him at his returne home to the caſtle, according to his accuſtomed maner. The captaine came vpon the drawe bridge with his men about him, to kiſſe the Dukes hand as their maner is. The Duke at this time was ſomewhat without the bridge, in ſuch ſort that the captain was forced to ſtep foorth a pace or two, where theſe two ſonnes of Saint Seuerin, and others that were about them laid hold vpon him. They within drew vp the bridge, but the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> cauſed an end of a waxe candle to be lighted, &amp; ſware that he would ſmite off their heads <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP2.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> if they yeelded not the place before the candle were burned out; whereupon they deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, and then he furniſhed it wel and ſurely for himſelfe, but all in the Dukes name. Further, he endited the captaine of high treaſon, laying to his charge that he would haue put the place into the Emperors hands: and ſtaied certaine Almains, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as practiſers with the captaine about this enterpriſe, yet afterward diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them without farther harme. He beheaded alſo one of his owne ſecretaries, charging him in like maner as a dealer in the matter, and yet one other who he ſaid had been a meſſenger <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP2.NOTE6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> between them. The captaine he kept long in priſon, yet in the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7649:145"/>
end deliuered him, pretending that Ducheſſe <hi>Bonne</hi> had once hired a brother of the captains to kill the ſaid <hi>Lodouic</hi> as he entred into the caſtel, whom the captaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> executing the fact, for the which cauſe he now ſaued his life. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if he had been giltie of ſo heinous a crime as a purpoſe to yeeld the place to the Emperor, who might haue laid claim to it, both as Emperor &amp; Duke of Auſtrich (for that houſe pretendeth ſome title thereunto:) I thinke he would not haue pardoned him; for it would haue made a great alteration in Italie, and the whole eſtate of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain would haue reuolted in one day. For when they liued vnder the Emperors, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie houſehold paid but halfe a ducat for tribute: but now they are cruelly and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſlie gouerned, both the Spiritualtie, Nobilitie and Commons.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> ſeeing himſelfe ſeized of the caſtell, and all the force of the countrie at his commandement, determined to attempt further; for he that poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Milan poſſeſſeth the whole eſtate, both bicauſe the chiefe of the countrie be reſident there, and alſo bicauſe thoſe that haue the charge and gouernment of the other places be all Milanois borne. Sure for the quantitie of this Duchie, I neuer ſaw a pleaſanter nor plentifuller peece of ground. For if the Prince would content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the yeerely reuenues of fiue hundred thouſand ducats; his ſubiects ſhould be but too rich, and the Prince liue in ſuretie: but he leuieth yeerely ſixe hundred and fiftie thouſand or ſeuen hundred thouſand, which is great tyrannie: and therefore the people deſire nothing more than change of their Prince. Which the L. <hi>Lodouic</hi> conſidering, togither with the other reaſons aboue rehearſed, and being already mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Duke of Ferraraes daughter, by whom he had many children, determined to accompliſh his intent, and endeuored to win friends not onely in the ſaid Duchie, but alſo abrode in Italie. Wherefore firſt he entred into league with the Venetians for the preſeruation of their eſtate, whereunto he was great friend to his father in lawes preiudice, from whom the ſaid Venetians not long before had taken a little territorie called the Poleſan, enuironed with water, and maruellouſly abounding with all kinde of wealth. This country being diſtant but halfe a league from Ferrara, the Venetians poſſeſſe yet at this day. There are in it two prety townes, which I haue been in my ſelfe, the one named Rouigue, the other Labadie. The Duke of Ferrara loſt it in the war that himſelfe firſt mooued againſt the Venetians: for notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that before the end of thoſe wars, <hi>Alphonſe</hi> Duke of Calabria (his father King <hi>Ferrande</hi> yet liuing) the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> with the force of Milan, the Florentines, the Pope, and the towne of Bolonia came to his aide: by meanes whereof the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were brought altogither vnder foote, or at the leaſt to great extremitie, being vtterly vnfurniſhed of monie, and hauing loſt diuers places: yet the ſaid <hi>Lodouic</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a treatie to their honor and profit; for euery man was reſtored to his owne ſaue the poore Duke of Ferrara, who was forced to leaue vnto them the Poleſan (which they yet hold:) notwithſtanding that he had mooued this war at the requeſt of the Lord <hi>Lodouic,</hi> and of King <hi>Ferrande</hi> whoſe daughter he had married. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port went that <hi>Lodouic</hi> receiued threeſcore thouſand ducats of the Venetians for making this treatie. Whether it were ſo or no, I know not, but ſure I am that the Duke of Ferrara was once perſwaded that it was ſo: for at that time the ſaid <hi>Lodouic</hi> was not married to his daughter. From that day forward amitie euer continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Venetians and the ſaid <hi>Lodouic.</hi> No ſeruant nor kinſman of <hi>Iohn Galeas</hi> Duke of Milan ſought to impeach and ſtop the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> from ſeizing the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie into his own hands, ſaue onely the Ducheſſe his wife, who was yoong, but a very wiſe Lady. She was daughter to <hi>Alfonſe</hi> Duke of Calabria before mentioned, ſonne and heire to <hi>Ferrande</hi> King of Naples. In the yeere 1493. the ſaid <hi>Lodouic</hi> ſent to King
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7649:146"/>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. now raigning, to perſwade him to come into Italie to conquer the realme of Naples, and to vanquiſh and ſubdue thoſe that poſſeſſed it: for ſo long as they floriſhed and were of force, he durſt neuer attempt that which afterward he accompliſhed. At that time the ſaid <hi>Ferrande</hi> King of Naples and <hi>Alphonſe</hi> his ſonne were puiſſant, rich, of great experience in the wars, and accounted Princes of hautie courages, though afterward their actions declared the contrarie. The ſaid <hi>Lodouic</hi> was alſo a very wiſe man, but maruellous timorous, and humble when he ſtood in feare, and void of all faith, if the breach thereof might turne to his profit. I ſpeake as one that knew him throughly well, bicauſe I haue dealt with him in many matters. But to proceede, in the yeere 1493. (as before I ſaid) the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> began to tickle this yoong King <hi>Charles,</hi> being but two and twenty yeeres of age, with the ambition and vaineglorie of Italie, ſhewing him what right he had to this goodly realme of Naples, which I warrant you he skilfully blazed and painted foorth. In all theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations he addreſſed himſelfe to <hi>Stephan de Vers,</hi> then newly made Seneſchall of Beaucaire, and maruellouſly enriched though not ſatisfied, and to the Generall <hi>Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonet,</hi> a rich man, skilfull in matters of the receit, and great friend at that time to the ſaid Seneſchall, by whoſe meanes the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> perſwaded the ſaid <hi>Briſſonet</hi> to become a prieſt, promiſing to make him a Cardinall, but the Seneſchall himſelfe he promiſed to make a Duke. And to ſet all theſe practiſes on foote, the ſaid <hi>Lodouic</hi> ſent in the ſame yeere to Paris a goodly ambaſſage to the King, the chiefe whereof was the Earle of Caiazze ſonne and heire to the aboue named <hi>Robert</hi> of Saint Seuerin, who found there the Prince of Salerne his coſin: for the ſaid Prince was chiefe of the houſe of Saint Seuerin (as I haue alreadie made mention) and liued in Fraunce, being baniſhed by King <hi>Ferrande</hi> of Naples, as before you haue heard, and therfore trauelled earneſtly that this voiage to Naples might go forward. With the ſaid Earle of Caiazze came alſo <hi>Charles</hi> Earle of Belleioyeuſe, and Maſter <hi>Galeas</hi> Viſcount of Milan, who were both in very good order and well accompanied, but openly they vſed ſalutations onely and generall ſpeeches. This was the firſt great ambaſſage that came from the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> to the King. True it is that he had ſent before this, one of his Secretaries to negotiate with the King, to ſend his deputie into Italie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue homage of his coſin the Duke of Milan for Genua, which was granted him againſt all reaſon <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP2.NOTE8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref>: notwithſtanding I will not denie, but that the King of eſpeciall fauor might aſſigne one to receiue it of him; for when this Duke <hi>Galeas</hi> was warde to his mother, I being then ambaſſador for King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. receiued his homage in the caſtell of Milan, hauing an expreſſe commiſſion from the King ſo to do. But Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua was then out of the Duke of Milans hands, and held by Maſter <hi>Baptiſt de Campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourgouſe;</hi> but at this preſent the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> had recouered it, and gaue to certaine of the Kings chamber eight thouſand ducats for the inueſture thereof, who by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the monie greatly preiudiced the King. For before the graunt of the ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſture, they might haue ſeized Genua to the Kings owne vſe, if they had would <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP2.NOTE9">

                  </ref>: but ſeeing they meant to take monie for it, they ought to haue demanded more: for Duke <hi>Galeas</hi> paide at one time for it to King <hi>Lewis</hi> my Maſter fiftie thouſand ducats, whereof the King (whoſe ſoule God pardon) gaue me thirtie thouſand crownes in reward. Notwithſtanding they ſaid they receiued theſe eight thouſand ducats with the Kings conſent, and <hi>Stephan de Vers</hi> Seneſchall of Beaucaire was one of thoſe that tooke the monie, happily to entertaine the better the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> for this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, which he ſo much both fauored and furthered. After audience giuen openly at Paris to the ambaſſadors aboue mentioned, the Earle of Caiazze had ſecret commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the King. The ſaid Earle was in great credit at Milan, but his brother
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:7649:146"/>
Maſter <hi>Galeas</hi> of Saint Seuerin in greater, eſpecially in martiall affaires. His Maſter could now diſpoſe of the eſtate of Milan as of his owne: for the which cauſe he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King great ſeruices and aide as well of men as mony, affirming the enterpriſe to be of no difficultie. This done, he and Maſter <hi>Galeas</hi> Viſcount tooke their leaue and departed, leauing behinde them the Earle <hi>Charles</hi> of Belleioyeuſe to entertaine the ſute, who incontinent put himſelfe into French apparell, and trauelled ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in this buſines, that many began to like of the enterpriſe.

Theſe practiſes and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to and fro continued the ſpace of ſeuen or eight moneths, and thoſe that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of this enterpriſe, communed among themſelues diuerſly of it, but none thought that the King would go in perſon into Italie.</p>

For he diſpoſed of this enterpriſe far otherwiſe than they imagined, for they thought not that the King would haue come in perſon into Italy, neither ſtoode they in any feare of the Turke, notwithſtanding their forged excuſe: for the Turke then raigning was a man of no valor <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP4.NOTE1">

Secondarily, that he had ſent a man purpoſely to Venice to poiſon their ceſterns, at the leaſt, as many as might be come vnto, for diuers of them be encloſed and locked.

                  </ref>. For all theſe conſiderations the Venetians thought it their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, that war ſhould ariſe betweene the King and the houſe of Arragon: but they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that it could not haue ended ſo ſoon as it did, &amp; that it ſhuld but weaken their enimies, not vtterly deſtroy them: and further, that if the woorſt fell, either the one partie or the other to haue their helpe, would giue them certaine townes in Pouille, lying vpon their ſea coaſt: as alſo in the end it hapned, but they had well neere miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reckoned themſelues. Laſtly, as touching the calling of the King into Italy, they thought it could not be laid to their charge, ſeeing they had giuen him neither coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell nor aide, as appeered by their anſwer to <hi>Peron</hi> of Baſche.</p>
               <p>In the yeere 1494. the King went to Lyons to attend to his affaires, but no man <note place="margin">1494.</note> thought he would paſſe the mountaines. Thither came to him the aboue named Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Galeas</hi> of Saint Seuerin, brother to the Earle of Caiazze with a goodly traine, ſent from the Lord <hi>Lodouic,</hi> whoſe lieutenant and principall ſeruant he was. He brought with him a great number of braue horſes and armours to run in, and ran himſelfe, and that very well, for he was a yoong and a gallant knight. The King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him very honorably, feaſted him ſumptuouſly, and gaue him his order. This done, he returned into Italy. But the Earle of Belleioyeuſe remained ſtill with the King to haſten the voiage. At Genua they began to arme a great nauie, whither the King ſent the Lord of Vrfé Maſter of his horſe, with diuers others. In the end he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued to Vienna in Daulphine, about the beginning of Auguſt in the ſame yeere, whither the nobles of Genua reſorted daily to him: wherefore to Genua he ſent <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of Orleans, now King of this realme, a yoong gentleman of goodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, but much giuen to his pleaſures, of whom in this hiſtory ample mention ſhal be made. It was then thought that the ſaid Duke of Orleans ſhould haue led this
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7649:148"/>
armie by ſea to land in the realme of Naples, by the conduct and direction of the aboue named baniſhed Princes of Salerne &amp; Biſignan. The whole nauie was fower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene ſhips of Genua, beſides a great number of gallies and galleons, and the King was as well obeied there in this caſe, as he ſhould haue been at Paris: for Genua was vnder the ſtate of Milan, where the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> gouerned all, hauing none to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay him, ſaue onely the Ducheſſe his nephewes wife, daughter to King <hi>Alphonſe,</hi> (for about this preſent his father King <hi>Ferrande</hi> died.) But the ſaid Lady preuailed little or nothing, both bicauſe men ſawe the King in a readines either to paſſe into Italy himſelfe, or to ſend his forces, and alſo bicauſe hir husband was a very ſimple man, and diſcloſed all hir dooings to the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> his vncle, who had already cauſed a meſſenger to be drowned ſent by hir, to hir father.</p>
               <p>This nauie did no ſeruice, notwithſtanding that the charges thereof amounted to three hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred thouſand franks, for all the treaſure that the K. could leuy was imploied that way, by means whereof he was vnfurniſhed as before I ſaid, both of good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, of money, and of al things neceſſary for ſuch an enterpriſe: yet God of his meere grace (as manifeſtly he declared) gaue it good ſucceſſe. I meane not that the King was not wiſe of his age, but he was but two and twenty yeeres old, newly crept out of the ſhell. The two aboue named that gouerned him in all this voiage, to wit <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen de Vers</hi> Seneſchall of Beaucaire, and the generall <hi>Briſſonnet,</hi> now Cardinall of Saint Malo, were men of meane eſtate, and of no experience, whereby ſo much the more appeered the woonderfull worke of God: our enimies on the other ſide, were accounted wiſe, of great experience in the wars, rich, accompanied with wiſe men and good captaines, and in poſſeſſion of the realme. I meane King <hi>Alphonſe</hi> (lately crowned by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> a Spaniard, borne in the realme of Arragon) who had the Florentines ioined with him, and great intelligence with the Turke. He had alſo a ſon bearing armes, called Dom <hi>Ferrande,</hi> a courteous yoong gentleman, of the age of two or three and twenty yeeres, who was welbeloued in the realme, and a brother alſo named Dom <hi>Frederic,</hi> who ſucceeded the ſaid <hi>Ferrande</hi> in this our age, and was a very wiſe man, and led their army vpon the ſea. He had been long trained vp on this ſide the mountaines, and of him you had often aſſured me my Lord of Vienna by your knowledge in Aſtrologie, that he ſhould be King, ſo that he once promiſed me fower thouſand franks of yeerely reuenewes in the ſaid realme, when that came to paſſe, which promiſe was made twenty yeeres before the propheſie tooke effect.</p>
               <p>Now to proceede, the King altered his minde <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP4.NOTE5">

Notwithſtanding the Generall in the end began to draw backe, ſeeing all men of wiſedome and vnderſtanding to miſlike this voiage for many reſpects, and eſpecially bicauſe the Kings forces lay abrode in camp in Auguſt, vnfurniſhed of monie, and all other things neceſſarie: but the Seneſchall alone carried the credit from them all, ſo far foorth that the King ſhewed a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of diſpleaſure to the Generall three or fower daies, but he ſoone recouered his fauour againe. At this preſent died one of the Seneſchals ſeruants of the plague, as men ſaid; for the which cauſe he durſt not repaire to the Kings preſence to his great griefe, for no man ſollicited the voiage: but on the contrarie ſide the D. &amp; Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe of Bourbon were there, laboring all that in them lay to ouerthrow it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto alſo the ſaid Generall encouraged them, by means whereof one day the voiage was daſhed, and another reuiued. In the end the King reſolued to go, and I my ſelfe mounted on horſebacke with the foremoſt, hoping to paſſe the mountains the more commodiouſly with ſmall companie: but I receiued a countermand, whereby I was

But the ſelfeſame day or the next day, <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of Orleance arriued there with certaine ſhips, and a good number of gallies, and one great galliaſſe being mine, the patrone whereof was one Maſter <hi>Albert Mely,</hi> and it caried the ſaid Duke and the principall of the armie, and manie goodly peeces of artillerie; for it was very ſtrong, and approched ſo neere the ſhore, that the very artillery almoſt diſcomfited the enimies, who before had neuer ſeene the like: for artillerie was at that time ſtrange and new to the Italian nation. The ſoldiers landed alſo that were in the other ſhips: and from Genua where the whole armie laie, came a band of Swiſſers by land led by the Bailife of Digeon, who had ioined with him certaine of the Duke of Milans forces (vnder the leading of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Iohn Lewis de Fliſco</hi> brother to the forenamed <hi>Breto,</hi> and of Maſter <hi>Iohn Adorne:)</hi> the which (notwithſtanding that they were not at the skirmiſh) ſhewed themſelues valiant ſoldiers in defending a ſtraight againſt the enimies.

Thoſe priſoners that were diſmiſſed, were all ſtripped to their ſhirts by the Duke of Milans bands, and other harme had they none, for ſuch is the law of armes in Italie. I ſaw all the letters that were ſent both to the King and to the Duke of Milan making report of this skirmiſh. Thus was the enimies Nauie repulſed, which afterward approched no more ſo neer. At our mens returne, the Genuois thought to haue raiſed a tumult and ſlew certaine Almaines in the towne, certaine alſo of them were ſlaine, but the matter was ſoone pacified.</p>
               <p>I muſt heere ſpeake a word or two of the Florentines, who had ſent twiſe to the King before his departure out of Fraunce meaning onely to diſſemble with him, with their firſt ambaſſadors (being the Biſhop of Areſe <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP5.NOTE6">

Theſe ambaſſadors depended wholie vpon <hi>Peter</hi> of Medicis a yoong man of ſmall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſonne to <hi>Laurence</hi> of Medicis who was dead, and had beene one of the wiſeſt men in his time, and had gouerned this citie almoſt as prince, as did alſo at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his ſonne: for their houſe had continued thus already two mens ages, namely <hi>Laurence</hi> the father of this <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Coſme</hi> of Medicis the firſt roote and founder of this houſe, a man woorthie among the woorthieſt. And ſure of their trade (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merchandiſe,) I thinke it hath beene the greateſt houſe that euer was in the world: for their ſeruants and factors haue had ſo great credit vnder their name that it is woonderfull.

and England. For I knew one called <hi>Gerard Quanueſe</hi> by whoſe onely helpe (in a maner) King <hi>Edward</hi> the fowerth kept the crowne on his head when ciuill wars were in the realme of England: for he lent him at times more then ſixſcore thouſand crownes, little for his Maſters profite, notwithſtanding he recouered his principall in the end. Another alſo I knew named <hi>Thomas Portunay,</hi> who was pledge at one time betweene the ſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> and Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of Burgundie for fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crownes, and at an other time in another place for forwerſcore thouſand. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend not the wiſedome of merchants in thus doing, but I commend Princes that vſe merchants well and keepe daie with them, for they know not when they ſhall need their helpe, and ſometime a little money doth great ſeruice.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth that this houſe of the Medicis fel to ruine as mighty houſes do in realms and Empires, for the great authoritie of this <hi>Peter</hi> of Medicis predeceſſors did him harme: notwithſtanding the gouernment of <hi>Coſme</hi> the firſt of this houſe was milde and gentle, ſuch as was agreeable with a free ſtate. But <hi>Lavvrence</hi> this <hi>Peters</hi> father (whom we now preſently write of) bicauſe of the great variance before mentioned in this hiſtorie, that was betweene him and them of Piſa and others (diuers of the <note place="margin">

But this <hi>Peter</hi> who ſucceeded his father (ſuppoſing the like authority to be due to him of right) became terrible by meanes of this guard, and vſed great violence in the night, beating men as they went in the ſtreetes, and abuſing their common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo had his father done alſo, but ſo wiſely, that they held themſelues in maner contented therewith.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond ambaſſage the ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> ſent to Lions, one called <hi>Peter Capon</hi> with diuers others, by whom he excuſed himſelfe, as before he had done, for not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the Kings requeſts, ſaying that King <hi>Levvis</hi> the eleuenth had commanded the towne of Florence, to enter into league with King <hi>Ferrande</hi> in the time of Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> of Aniou, and to depart from their league with the ſaid Duke: wherefore ſeeing by the Kings commandement they were entred into this league, which endured yet certaine yeeres; they could not abandon nor forſake the houſe of Arragon. But if the King hapned to come into their countrey, they promiſed to do him great ſeruices, which offer they made bicauſe they thought (as the Venetians did) that the King would not come into Italy. In both theſe ambaſſages there was ſome one enimy to the ſaid <hi>de Medicis,</hi> eſpecially in the latter this <hi>Capon,</hi> who ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aduertiſed vs by what meanes the citie of Florence might be brought to rebell againſt the ſaid <hi>Peter,</hi> and deliuered alſo his meſſage in far woorſe termes than indeed it was ſent; and further, gaue aduiſe to baniſh all the Florentines out of Fraunce, and ſo were they <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP5.NOTE8">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue told you alreadie what happened vpon the ſea at Rapalo. Dom <hi>Frederike</hi> retired to Piſa and Ligorne, leauing his foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men behinde him whom he had landed. The Florentines waxed maruellous wearie of him; for they be and euer haue been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affected to the houſe of Fraunce, than to that of Arragon. Our armie that was in Romaine (notwithſtanding that it were the weaker) furthered greatly our affaires; for it made Dom <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rande</hi> D. of Calabria by little &amp; little to retire: which when the K. perceiued, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to paſſe forward, being earneſtly ſollicited therunto by the Lord <hi>Lodouic,</hi> and the others aboue named. The ſaid <hi>Lodouic</hi> at his firſt meeting with the King ſpake thus vnto him: Sir, feare not this enterpriſe, there are in Italie but three mightie eſtates, one of the which taketh part with you which is Milan; another mooueth not, to wit, the Venetians, ſo that you haue onely to do with the force of Naples. But diuers of your anceſtors haue ouerthrowen vs all three being ioined togither. Sir, if you will credit me, I will helpe to make you greater than euer was <hi>Charleman:</hi> for we will eaſily chaſe the Turke out of the Empire of Conſtantinople, hauing ſubdued the realme of Naples.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7649:151"/>
thought himſelfe a great man, and ſome breach was happened betweene the Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchall and him: for the which cauſe the L. <hi>Lodouic</hi> mooued both the K. and the ſaide Seneſchall that the Generall might be ſent home, which his words cauſed the ſaide Generall openly to babble againſt him, and to ſay that he would deceiue the whole companie: but ſilence would better haue becommed him. Notwithſtanding as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him, neuer wiſe man made account of him in matter of eſtate, both bicauſe he vnderſtood not what it meant, and alſo bicauſe he was light of talke: but ſure he was well affected to his Maſter. They concluded in the end to ſend abrode diuers ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, and my ſelfe among the reſt was appointed to go to Venice, but my diſpatch was delaied awhile, bicauſe the King was ſicke of the ſmall pocks, and in danger of death: for an ague was ioined with his diſeaſe, but it endured not paſt ſixe or ſeuen daies. Then I departed leauing the King in Aſt, and verily beleeuing that he would paſſe no further: in ſixe daies I went to Venice with my mules and carriage; for the way was maruellous faire. But I departed from the ſaid towne of Aſt in great feare, doubting the Kings returne home: notwithſtanding God had otherwiſe diſpoſed of this enterpriſe, for he went ſtraight to Pauie, and paſſed through Caſall, where the Marchioneſſe of Montferrat lay, which was a good Lady, and great friend to vs, but deadly enimie to the Lord <hi>Lodouic,</hi> and he alſo to hir. When the King arriued at Pauie, ſome ſmall ielouſie began to ariſe; for they would haue lodged him in the towne and not in the caſtell, but he would not lodge but in the caſtell, and ſo he did. Thoſe that were neere about him haue told me, that he was there in ſome danger. Wherefore the ſelfeſame night the watch was r'enforced, whereat the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> maruelled greatly, ſo far foorth that he communed thereof with the King, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if he had conceiued any ſuſpicion of him. To be ſhort, their behauiour was ſuch on both ſides, that their amitie could not long endure: but we babbled much more than they, not the King himſelfe, but certaine of his neereſt kinſmen <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP6.NOTE3">

In this caſtell of Pauie was <hi>Iohn Galeas</hi> Duke of Milan, and his wife daughter to King <hi>Alphonſe</hi> in very pitious eſtate: for hir husband being ſicke, was held in this caſtell as vnder garde, and hir ſonne who is yet liuing, with a daughter or two. The childe was then about fiue yeeres old, and him euery man might ſee, but no man might ſee the Duke: for my ſelfe paſſed that way three daies before the King, and could by no meanes be ſuffered to come to him. Euery body ſaid he was extreme ſicke: notwithſtanding the King ſpake with him; for he was his coſin germane <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP6.NOTE4">

                  </ref>, and he hath told me that their communication was onely generall talke, bicauſe he would in no wiſe offend the Lord <hi>Lodouic;</hi> notwithſtanding that he were very deſirous to haue aduertiſed his ſaid coſin of diuers matters. At the ſame time the Ducheſſe fell vpon hir knees before the ſaid <hi>Lodouic,</hi> deſiring him to haue pitie vpon hir father and brother. He anſwered that it could not be. But to ſay the truth, ſhe might better haue intreated for hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and hir ſelfe, being at that time a goodly yoong Lady.</p>
               <p>From thence the King remooued to Plaiſance, where the ſaid <hi>Lodouic</hi> receiued let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that his nephewe the Duke Milan lay at the point of death, wherefore he tooke his leaue of the King to go to him. The King deſired him to returne, and ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do. Before he came to Pauie the Duke died, whereupon he rid incontinent, as it were in poſte to Milan. Al theſe newes I vnderſtood by a letter that the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ambaſſador reſident with the ſaid <hi>Lodouic</hi> ſent to Venice, wherein alſo he aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Seniorie that he meant to make himſelfe Duke, whichboth the Duke of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice and the Seniorie vtterly miſliked, ſo far foorth that they asked me whether the King would not defend the childe; which though reaſon required that he ſhould: yet I made the matter doubtfull, conſidering how neceſſary an inſtrument the ſaid
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7649:151"/>
Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> was at that time for the Kings affaires.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, he made himſelfe to be receiued at Milan as Duke, which was the onely end (as ſome ſaid) why he had cauſed vs to paſſe the mountaines. Manie alſo charged him with his nephewes death, whoſe kinsfolkes and friends in Italy were in armes to haue taken the gouernment from him, which they would eaſily haue done, had not the Kings comming ſtopped them. For they were already in Romaine (as you haue heard.) But the Earle of Caiazze and the Lord of Aubigny made them to retire. For the ſaid Lord of Aubigny had with him a company of a hundred &amp; fifty or two hundred men of armes French, and a good band of Swiſſers. Dom <hi>Ferrande</hi> and his forces retired towards their friends, diſlodging euer halfe a daies iourney be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our men, and marched towards Furly <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP6.NOTE5">

Further, the people of Italy began in all places to take hart and to deſire change and alteration: for they ſawe that which before they had neuer ſeene, I meane the feate of artillerie, which they were vnacquainted with, &amp; which in Fraunce was neuer more practiſed than at that time. The ſaid Dom <hi>Ferrande</hi> approched ſtill neerer and neerer to his realme, and went to Seſenne, a faire citie of the Popes in the Marque of Anconne; but the people ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his carriage &amp; ſtuffe whenſoeuer they tooke his men at aduantage. And through all Italy they would haue rebelled, if the wars had been ordered on our ſide without ſpoile: but all was done cleane contrary, to my great griefe, bicauſe of the honor and renowme the French nation might haue obtained by this voiage. For at our firſt arriuall the people honored vs as ſaints, ſuppoſing all faith and vertue to be in vs: but their opinion endured not long, partly bicauſe of the diſorder and ſpoile our men vſed; and partly bicauſe of the ſlanderous reports our enimies made of vs in all places, charging vs that we forced women, and robbed and carried away money, and whatſoeuer we could lay hands on, of heinouſer crimes they could not haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed vs in Italy, for no nation is ſo ielous and couetous as the Italian.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He King (as before you haue heard) was at Plaiſance, where he cauſed a ſolemne funerall to be made for his coſin germaine the Duke of Milan; for other thing wiſt he not what to do, the new Duke of Milan being departed from him. They that beſt vnderſtood the courſe of theſe affaires, haue told me that the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany deſired to returne home, aſwel for that they were vnprouided of all things neceſſarie, as alſo bicauſe of diuers doubts that were ariſen: for certaine that at the firſt ſeemed to haue great good liking of this voiage, began now vtterly to diſallow thereof, namely the Lord of Vrfé Maſter of the horſe, who was not with the King, but lay ſicke at Genua: whence he wrote him a letter, giuing him therein to vnderſtand of diuers doubts and iealouſies whereof he was aduertiſed. But (as before I haue ſaid in diuers places) God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly declared that he himſelfe gouerned this enterpriſe. For ſuddenly in the necke of this letter, newes came to the King that the Duke of Milan would ſhortly return, and that the Florentines began to fauor vs in hatred of <hi>Peter de Medicis,</hi> who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned them as if he had been their Prince, to the great diſcontentation both of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his owne neere kinſmen, and of diuers alſo the beſt citizens, namely the <hi>Capons,</hi> the <hi>Sonderini</hi>

                  </ref>, the <hi>Nerly,</hi> and in maner the whole citie. Wherefore the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Plaiſance and marched towards the Florentines territories, meaning either to cauſe them to declare themſelues for him, or to take their townes being vnfortified, and lodge his men in them all the winter, which was already begun. Diuers ſmall places yeelded vnto him, ſo did alſo the citie of Luques enimie to the Florentines, ſhewing him all pleaſure and ſeruice that in them lay. Now you ſhall vnderſtand that the Duke of Milan had two purpoſes in his head; firſt he ſought by all meanes poſſible to ſtaie the King from paſſing further that ſommer <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP7.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>. Secondari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he hoped to obtaine of him Piſa (a great and a faire citie) togither with Serzane, and Petreſancte, which two places had been ſubiect to the Geneuois not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and were woon from them by the Florentines in <hi>Laurence de Medicis</hi> time.</p>
               <p>The King paſſed through Pontreme one of the D. of Milans townes, and went to beſiege Serzane the ſtrongeſt and the beſt caſtle the Florentines had, but vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed bicauſe of their great diuiſion. To ſay the truth the Florentines neuer beare armes willingly againſt the houſe of Fraunce: for they haue euer faithfully ſerued it &amp; taken part with it, both bicauſe of their great traficke in Fraunce, &amp; alſo bicauſe they haue euer been of the Guelphes faction <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP7.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>. If this place had been well furniſhed the King muſt of neceſſitie haue broken his armie: for the countrie is verie barren &amp; ful of hils, &amp; victuals there were none to be gotten: beſides that the ſnow lay maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deepe vpon the ground. After the Kings ſiege had lien before it three daies, the Duke of Milan came thither no compoſition being yet made betweene the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines and the King <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP7.NOTE4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref>, and paſſed through Pontreme, where the towneſmen and the ſoldiers of the garriſon fell at ſuch variance with our Almaines (led by one <hi>Buſer)</hi> that certaine of the ſaide Almaines were ſtaine: of the which braule ſprang a great inconuenience, as heereafter you ſhall heare. For although I were not my ſelfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:7649:152"/>
at the doing of theſe things: yet vnderſtood I of them both by the King, the Duke, and diuers others. The Florentines began now to practiſe, and appointed fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene or ſixteene to go to the King, ſaying, that they would no longer continue in this great danger, nor ſuſtaine the diſpleaſure of the King and the Duke of Milan, who had continually an ambaſſador reſident at Florence. And <hi>Peter</hi> of Medices conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſending of this ambaſſage; for to ſay the truth, he could not remedie it, conſidering vpon what termes they ſtood: for if they had done otherwiſe, they had been vndone, being vnprouided of all things, and vtterly vnacquainted with the wars. When theſe ambaſſadors came to the Kings preſence, they offered to receiue him into Florence and their other places, neither cared the greater part of them how the world went, ſo that we would come to Florence to chaſe away <hi>Peter</hi> of Medices; which matter they earneſtly preſſed, bicauſe they had good intelligence with the aboue named that gouerned then the Kings affaires.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide <hi>Peter</hi> of Medices practiſed by a ſeruant of his owne named <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Spinelly,</hi> who was his factor at Lyons, and an honeſt man in his vocation, and had liued long in Fraunce: but of the ſtate of our Court he could vnderſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, no hardly they that had beene Courtiers all their liues, bicauſe of the often changes and alterations. This <hi>Spinelly</hi> negotiated with thoſe that heeretofore had borne all the ſway, namely, the Lord of Breſſe afterward Duke of Sauoye, and the Lord of Miolans chamberlaine to the King. Soone after the aboue named ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors were returned to Florence, <hi>Peter</hi> of Medices accompanied with certaine of the citie, came himſelfe to the King to make anſwer to our requeſts: for they within the citie ſawe vtter deſtruction before their eies, vnleſſe they yeelded to all the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds; whoſe fauour they hoped to obtaine, by offering him ſome greater ſeruice than any of the other townes that had already receiued him. At his arriuall Monſeur <hi>de Piennes</hi> a Flemming borne, and Chamberlaine to the King, and the generall <hi>Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnet</hi> were ſent to treate with him, who required him to yeeld vnto the King the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell of Serzane, which preſently he did. They required him further to lend the King Piſa, Ligorne, Petreſanct, and Librefacto: whereunto he alſo agreed incontinent, neuer communicating the matter with his collegues, who ſuppoſed that the King ſhould onely haue lodged in Piſa, and theſe other places to refreſh himſelfe, but not haue held them ſtill: well, by this meanes they yeelded their whole eſtate and force into our hands. Thoſe that negotiated with the ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> haue told both me and others ſince, ſcoffing and ieſting at him, that they woondred to ſee him ſo lightly condeſcend to ſo waightie a matter, granting more than they looked for. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the King entred into Piſa, and the aboue named ambaſſadors returned to Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, where the ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> cauſed the Kings lodging to be made in his owne houſe, which was the goodlieſt of a citizens or merchants houſe that euer I ſaw, and better furniſhed than any mans houſe in the world of his eſtate.</p>
               <p>I muſt heere ſpeake a word or two of the Duke of Milan, who now wiſhed the King with all his hart out of Italy, notwithſtanding that both already he had made his profit by him, and ſought alſo ſtill ſo to do: for he was in hope to obtaine of him, the places yeelded by the Florentines, and preſſed him earneſtly for Serzane, and Petreſancte, which he ſaid appertained to the Genuois: he lent him alſo at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent 30. thouſand ducats, and he hath ſince told both me and others, that theſe places were promiſed him. But when he ſawe that he could not obtaine them, he departed in great diſpleaſure from the King, pretending that earneſt buſines called him home, which was the laſt time the King ſaw him: notwithſtanding, he left Maſter <hi>Galeas</hi> of Saint Seuerin behind him, whom he ioined in commiſſion in all matters with the

Earle <hi>Charles</hi> of Belleioyeuſe. The ſaid Maſter <hi>Galeas</hi> while the King lay in Piſa, ſent (by his Maſters aduiſe) for the chiefe citizens of the towne to his lodging, where he perſwaded them to rebell againſt the Florentines, and to deſire the King to reſtore them to their ancient liberty, truſting by this meanes that Piſa would fall into the Duke of Milans clawes, vnder whoſe obedience it had been <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP7.NOTE5">

Further, one of the ſaid monkes who was borne at Bourges, called him Saint, as he talked with me; and I asked him in his eare why he called him Saint, conſidering he might behold pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted round about him the armes of many cities which he had wrongfully vſurped <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP7.NOTE7">

                  </ref>, and ſeeing the image of him and his horſe being of fine marble ſtood higher than the altar, and yet his body lay vnder his horſe feete. He anſwered me ſoftly, Sir, in this countrey we call all thoſe Saints that haue done vs any good, and he built this goodly charterhouſe church, which in very deed is the faireſt that euer I ſaw, for it is all of fine marble. But to proceede, the ſaid Maſter <hi>Galeas</hi> ſought to make himſelfe great, and ſo I thinke did the Duke of Milan alſo, bicauſe he had married his baſe daughter: for he manifeſtly declared that he would aduance him, as his owne ſonne, bicauſe at that time his owne children were all very yoong. The ſaid Piſans were I confeſſe cruelly handled by the Florentines, for they vſed them like ſlaues. They had ſubdued them about a hundred yeeres before, euen in the ſelfe ſame yeere that the Venetians conquered Padua, which was the firſt victory that they obtained vpon the firme land. And the fortune of theſe two cities was almoſt alike, for they had been ancient enimies to thoſe whom now they ſerued, many yeeres before they were conquered, and almoſt of equall force with them. Theſe Piſans conſulted togither about this motion, and ſeeing themſelues counſelled by ſo great a perſonage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo of themſelues deſirous of libertie: a great number of them both men and women, came crying to the King as he went to maſſe, Libertie, libertie, deſiring him with weeping eies to graunt it them. One of the Maſters of the requeſts (who was a counſellor of the parliament in Daulphine named <hi>Robot)</hi> going before the King, or executing his office ſaid vnto him, (were it bicauſe he had promiſed the Piſans ſo to do: or bicauſe he vnderſtood not what they demanded) that it was a lamemtable caſe, and that of right he ought to graunt them their petition, adding, that neuer men were ſo cruelly handled. The King not vnderſtanding well what this word meant, but bewailing in his minde the miſerable eſtate of the Italian nation, and the cruelty that both Princes &amp; commonalties vſe towards their ſubiects (notwithſtanding that in reaſon he could not graunt them their liberty, ſeeing the towne was none of his, but lent him vpon friendſhip at his great need:) anſwered that he was contented to grant their requeſt, &amp; ſo the counſellor aboue named declared vnto them: wherupon the people incontinent began to proclaim holiday in token of ioy, and went to their bridge which is a very goodly one built ouer the riuer of Arne, &amp; threw down to the ground, &amp; afterward into the riuer a great lion ſtanding vpon a ſtrong pillar of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble called maior, repreſenting the Seniorie of Florence: vpon the which pillar they cauſed to be erected the image of a K. of Fraunce holding a naked ſword in his hand, &amp; treading the maior or lion vnder his horſe feet. But after, when the K. of Romains entred the town, they did with the Kings image as now with the lion: for ſuch is the nature of the Italian nation, to turne euer with the ſtrongeſt. Notwithſtanding theſe Piſans were then &amp; yet are ſo cruelly handled that they are to be holden for excuſed.</p>

The ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> after he had yeelded to the King the places aboue mentioned with the conſent of certaine of the towne, returned to the citie, ſuppoſing that the King would not hold them ſtill, but reſtore them at his departute from Piſa, where he would but repoſe himſelfe three or fower daies. Yet am I of opinion that if it had pleaſed him to winter there, they would willingly haue agreed thereunto, notwithſtanding that Piſa be of greater importance to them than Florence it ſelfe, ſaue that their perſons and goods be reſident in Florence <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP8.NOTE2">

At the ſaid <hi>Peters</hi> returne to Florence, euery man frowned vpon him, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe: for he had diſpoſſeſſed them of their whole force, and of all that they had conquered in a hundred yeeres, ſo that their mindes ſeemed already to foretell them the euils that afterward fell vpon them. Wherefore partly for this cauſe (which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be the principall, though they neuer vttered it) partly for the great hatred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearſed, which they bare him, and partly alſo to recouer their libertie, wherof they thought themſelues bereaued by him: they determined to baniſh him the towne, forgetting all the benefits of <hi>Coſmus</hi> and <hi>Laurence de Medicis</hi> his anceſtors. The ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> hauing no certaine intelligence of this their determination, yet doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

it, went to the palace with his ordinarie garde to aduertiſe them of the Kings comming, who was about three miles from the towne: but when he came to the palace gate and knocked, one of the houſe of Nerly (being the father and many ſonnes whom my ſelfe knew well, all of great wealth) refuſed to let him in, ſaying, that if he would enter alone he ſhould, otherwiſe not; and he that made him this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall was armed. The ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> returned incontinent to his houſe, and armed both himſelfe and his ſeruants, determining to make reſiſtance againſt his enimies in the towne. Whereof he alſo aduertiſed one <hi>Paule Vrſin,</hi> who was in pay with the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines (for the ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> was by his mother of the houſe of <hi>Vrſins,</hi> and both his father and he had euer giuen entertainment to certaine of them) but immediately after, they heard the people crie, Libertie, libertie, and ſawe them come towards his houſe in armes. Whereupon (following good aduice) by the helpe of <hi>Paule Vrſin</hi> he departed the towne, which was a miſerable departure to him: for in power and wealth both he and his anceſtors, ſince the time of <hi>Coſmus de Medicis</hi> the firſt of that houſe, had been in maner equall with great Princes: and this day fortune began to frowne vpon him, ſo that he loſt both honor and riches. At this preſent my ſelfe was at Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, and by the ambaſſador of Florence there reſident, vnderſtood of all theſe newes, which greatly diſpleaſed me; for I had loued his father well. If the ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> had followed mine aduice, all this had neuer happened: for immediately after my arriuall at Venice I wrote vnto him, offering to make his peace with the King; for I had commiſſion by mouth both from the Seneſchall of Beaucaire and the Generall ſo to do: and I am well aſſured the King would haue held himſelfe contented with paſſage through their countrie, at the moſt with Ligorne, and (that being obtained) haue agreed to all the ſaid <hi>Peters</hi> demaunds. But he by the perſwaſion of the aboue named <hi>Peter Capon,</hi> anſwered me in maner with ſcoffes. The ſaid ambaſſador the next day deliuered a letter to the Senate of Venice, the contents whereof were, that the ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> was baniſhed the towne, bicauſe he ſought to make himſelfe Lord thereof by aide of the houſe of Arragon and the <hi>Vrſins,</hi> and diuers other matters they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with that were vntrue. But ſuch be the chaunces and changes of this world, that he that is in aduerſitie, hath not onely his enimies to purſue him, but his friends alſo become his foes, as appeered by this ambaſſador named <hi>Paule Anthony Sonderin,</hi> (one of the wiſeſt men in Italie) who but the day before talked with me of this <hi>Peter</hi> as if he had been his ſoueraigne Lord, yet now declared himſelfe his enimie. True it is that it was by the Seniories commandement; for of himſelfe particularly he made no declaration. The next day I was aduertiſed that the ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> came to Venice, and that the King in great triumph was entred into Florence. Moreouer, the Senate of Florence commanded their ambaſſador to take his leaue of the Seniorie of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, and returne home with all ſpeede. The letter himſelfe ſhewed me, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. Two daies after his departure arriued <hi>Peter de Medicis</hi> in his doublet and his hoſe, or in one of his ſeruants clokes. The Venetians ſtood in great doubt to receiue him; ſo much feared they the Kings diſpleaſure. And notwithſtanding that they could not of their honor refuſe him, yet made they him ſtay two daies without the towne, being very deſirous to vnderſtand of me, how the King would take it, if they receiued him. I for my part deſired to do him good, and the King had written no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me againſt him: wherefore I anſwered them, that I thought he was fled for feare of the people, not of the King. Whereupon he entred the towne, and the next day after he had been with the Seniorie, I went to viſit him. They lodged him well, and permitted both himſelfe and fifteene or twenty of his ſeruants that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, to weare their weapons in the towne <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP8.NOTE3">

aboue mentioned had ſtopped them in times paſt from taking of Milan, yet vſed they him very well, and reuerenced him for the honor of his houſe, which had beene of ſo great eſtimation and renowme through all Chriſtendome. When I ſawe him me thought he ſeemed a man of no great ſtuffe, he diſcourſed to me at large of all his misfortunes, and I, as well as I could, comforted him. Among other things, he told me that he had loſt all, and that aboue all his other miſhaps this moſt grieued him, that a factor of his in the towne had refuſed to giue him credit for cloth but to the value of 100. ducats to apparell his brother and himſelfe, which was a ſtrange thing, conſidering his eſtate and authoritie: for by the ſpace of threeſcore yeeres the eſtimation of his houſe had been ſo great, that greater it could not be.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next daie the King entered into Florence where the ſaid <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had prepared his owne houſe to receiue him, but the Lord of Ballaſſat who was ſent thither before to make the Kings lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, vnderſtanding of the ſaide <hi>Peters</hi> departure: fell to ſpoile all that he found in his houſe, pretending that his banke at Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought him a great ſumme of money. Among other things he tooke one whole Vnicornes horne, valued at ſixe or ſeauen thouſand ducats, and two great peeces of another, with a number of other goodly things, which others ſeeing did the like. Into another houſe in the towne the ſaid <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had conueied all his goodlieſt ſtuffe, but the people ſpoiled that alſo. The Senio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie had part of his richeſt iewels, twenty thouſand ducats in coine that lay in his banke in the towne, diuers faire pots of Agate, and ſuch a number of goodly Camayeux excellently well cut, (all the which my ſelfe once ſaw) as is woonderfull, togither with three thouſand medales of gold &amp; ſiluer weying 40. pound weight, the number and goodnes wherof I thinke all Italy could not match. All that he loſt that day in the citie, amounted to a hundred thouſand crownes and better. The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Florence (as you haue heard) made a treatie with the citizens to their great good liking as I ſuppoſe. The conditions were theſe: They gaue him ſixe ſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ducats, whereof they paied him fiftie thouſand preſently, and the reſt at two paiments very ſhortly after, they lent him all the places aboue mentioned, they changed their armes being the red flower deluce, and gaue the Kings armes. And he
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7649:155"/>
for his part receiued them into his ſafegarde and protection, and promiſed &amp; ſware vpon the altar of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> to reſtore their places vnto them within fower moneths after he ſhould be entred into Naples, or ſooner, if ſooner he returned into Fraunce. But the matter fell otherwiſe out, as heereafter you ſhall heare.</p>
               <p>The King ſtaied not long at Florence, but went to Senes, where he was honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly receiued; and from thence to Viterbe, where Dom <hi>Ferrand</hi> (who as you haue heard retired towards Rome) was once minded to haue lodged &amp; fortified his campe, and to haue fought if he had ſeene his aduantage, as I was aduertiſed both by King <hi>Alphonſes</hi> ambaſſador, and alſo by the Popes legate being at Venice. And ſure I looked euer when King <hi>Alphonſe</hi> being accounted a valiant Prince, ſhould haue come thither in perſon, leauing his ſonne in his realme: for in mine opinion the place had beene greatly for his aduantage, conſidering he ſhould haue had his owne realme, the dition of the church, and the places and territories of the Vrſins on his backe. Wherefore I was maruellouſly aſtoniſhed when I receiued letters from the King that he was entred the towne of Viterbe, and likewiſe the caſtle, which ſoone after his entrie into the towne a commander yeelded vnto him <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP9.NOTE1">

                  </ref>, by meanes of the Cardinall <hi>Petri ad Vincula</hi> (who was gouernor thereof) and of the Colonnois. And then began I to my ſelfe that God was fully purpoſed to accompliſh this enterpriſe, ſo far foorth that I repented me that in my letters I had aduiſed the King not to refuſe an honorable compoſition, for they offered him ynough. But to proceede, Aquependant, Monteflaſcon, and all the places round about yeelded before Viterbe, as I was aduertiſed both by the Kings and alſo the Seniories letters (who were daily informed by their ambaſſadors of all that hapned) diuers of the which they ſhewed me, or cauſed one of their ſecretaries to report vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. From thence the K. marched to Rome, through the Vrſins territories, which were all yeelded to him by the Lord <hi>Charles Vrſin,</hi> who ſaid that he had commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his father <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP9.NOTE2">

Thus liue they in Italy both Princes and captaines in continuall practiſe with their enimies, and turning euer as they ſee fortune encline. Further, the King was receiued into Brachane, the ſaid <hi>Virgile Vrſins</hi> principall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which was faire, ſtrong, and ſo well furniſhed of victuals, that I haue heard the King oftentimes commend both the place and the good entertainment he found there. For his army was in ſuch extremity and penurie of victuals that in greater it could not be. To be ſhort, who ſo ſhall conſider how often this army was vpon the point to returne home ſince the time it firſt arriued at Vienna in Daulphine, and by what means and ouuertures the iourney was ſtill continued: I thinke he will confeſſe that God was the leader thereof.</p>

For ſince the time I now write of, the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnois became our enimies, though to their great diſhonor: for they poſſeſſed of the Kings gift in the realme of Naples, namely in the Earledome of Taillecouſe, and other places which the Vrſins had held before, 20000. ducats and better of yeerely reuenues <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP10.NOTE3">

               <p>At Oſtie with the ſaid Cardinall were fiue hundred men of armes, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Swiſſers led by the Earle of Ligny (the Kings coſin germaine by the mother,) the Lord of Alegre, and diuers others, who thought to haue paſſed the riuer of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre there, &amp; to haue incloſed Dom <hi>Ferrand</hi> within Rome by aide of the Coulonnois, the principall of the which houſe were at that time <hi>Proſpere</hi> and <hi>Fabrice Coulonne,</hi> and the Cardinall <hi>Coulonne,</hi> accompanied with two thouſand footemen, whom the King paied by the hands of the aboue named <hi>Baſche.</hi> The ſaid footemen they had leuied at their owne pleaſure, and muſtred at Sanneſonne, a towne of their owne.</p>

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7649:156"/>
is to be ſaid. Before the King entred into Viterbe, he had ſent to Rome Monſeur <hi>de la Trimoille</hi> his chamberlaine, the preſident <hi>Ganay</hi> keeper of the ſeale, and the generall <hi>Bidaut,</hi> to enter into intelligence with the Pope, who practiſed continually after the manner of Italy. They being in Rome, the Pope in the night receiued Dom <hi>Ferrand</hi> with his whole forces into the towne, whereupon our ambaſſadors and ſome fewe of their ſeruants were ſtaied: but the ſelfe ſame day the Pope diſmiſſed them. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he held ſtill in priſon the Cardinall <hi>Aſcaigne</hi> his vicechauncellor, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Duke of Milan, and <hi>Proſpere Coulonne,</hi> ſome ſaid by their owne accord. Of all theſe accidents I was aduertiſed incontinent by the Kings letters, but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niorie more amplie by their ambaſſadors. All this hapned before the King entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Viterbe, for neither party ſtaied aboue two daies in a place. But as touching our affaires they proſpered better than we could wiſh, and no maruell: for the Lord of Lords gaue them ſucceſſe, as all men might manifeſtly perceiue.</p>
               <p>This army that lay in Oſtie could do no ſeruice bicauſe of the foule weather; further, you ſhall vnderſtand that the force which the Lord of Aubigny led, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the King, and himſelfe alſo, neither had he further charge thereof. The Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians were alſo diſmiſſed that had been with him in Romaine, vnder the leading of the Lord <hi>Rodolph</hi> of Mantua, the Lord <hi>Galeot</hi> of Mirandula, and of <hi>Fracaſſe</hi> brother to the L. <hi>Galeas</hi> of Saint Seuerin, the which with their ſaid company being to the number of fiue hundred men of armes, were well paied by the King, for they ſerued him as before you haue heard.

Moreouer, he vſed within his realme all trade of merchandiſe himſelfe, ſo far foorth that he deliuered ſwine to his people to feede, which they were conſtrained to fat to further their ſale: and if any of them happened to die, they were forced to make them good. In thoſe places where the oile oliue groweth (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Pouille) he and his ſonne bought it all vp at their owne price: and in like maner the corne yet greene vpon the ground, which they ſold againe as deere as was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and if the price thereof happened to fall, they conſtrained their ſubiects to buie it: beſides that, during the time of their ſale, all other were forbidden to ſell. If any of their noblemen were a good husband, and thought to ſpare ſome good thing for himſelfe, they would foorthwith deſire to borrow it; and if he made refuſall, he was conſtrained to deliuer it perforce: ſo that they vſed to take from them the races of their horſes (wherewith that countrie aboundeth) and to cauſe them to be broken &amp; kept to their own vſe: yea and that ſuch numbers as well of horſes as of mares and colts, that they were eſteemed many thouſands, which alſo they ſent to feede in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places in the paſtures of their noble men and other their ſubiects to their great loſſe and dammage. Both of them had forced many women; and as touching the Church, they had it in no reuerence, neither would obey the lawes thereof, ſo far foorth that they ſold Biſhoprikes for monie; as for example, the Biſhoprike of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente ſold to a Iew by King <hi>Ferrande</hi> for thirteene thouſand ducats, to beſtow vpon his ſonne, who (he ſaid) was a Chriſtian. Abbeies they gaue to faulconers and others, to beſtow vpon their children, with this condition, that ſome of them ſhould enter them a certaine number of hauks, and keepe them flying to their vſe, and other ſome entertaine a number of ſoldiers, at their owne proper coſts and charges. The ſonne neuer obſerued Lent, neither ſeemed to thinke there was any, and many yeeres togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neuer confeſſed himſelfe, neither receiued the holy ſacrament. To conclude, it was impoſſible for any man to commit more hainous crimes than both they had done; yet ſome reported the yoong <hi>Ferrande</hi> to be woorſe than them both, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he were humble and curteous at his death; and no maruell, for he was then in great diſtreſſe.</p>
               <p>The readers may happily thinke that I vtter all this of ſome priuate hatred againſt them, which in good ſooth I do not, but rehearſe it onely to continue my hiſtorie, in the verie beginning whereof I haue declared, that this enterpriſe could neuer haue
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7649:157"/>
been atchieued by thoſe that were the chiefe managers thereof, had not God alone gouerned it, and giuen it good ſucceſſe, to the end he might make this good yoong King being ſo ſlenderly prouided both of good counſell and all other things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie: his deputie to chaſtiſe theſe Princes ſo wiſe, ſo rich, of ſo great experience, ſo well accompanied with wiſe and noble perſonages whom the defence of the realme touched as neere as themſelues, ſo allied and friended; yea and the which ſaw the ſtorme a far off, and yet neuer could prouide for it, nor make reſiſtance in any place. For out of the caſtle of Naples there was not one man that ſtaied the King a daie and a night: whereupon Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> now liuing ſaide, that the French men came thither with wooden ſpurs, and chalke in their harbingers hands to make their lodgings without further trouble: which ſimilitude of wooden ſpurs he vſed, bicauſe yet at this daie, when the yoong gentlemen of this realme rid about the ſtreets on horſebacke, their Pages thruſt little ſticks into their ſhowes or pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofles, wherewith they prick forward their mules. And to confeſſe the truth, this was ſo eaſie a conqueſt, that our men very ſeldom armed themſelues in all this voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Beſides that, from the Kings departure out of Aſt, till his entrie into Naples, it was but fower moneths and ninteene daies. An ambaſſador would almoſt haue been as long in iourneying thither. I conclude therfore agreeably to the opinion of diuers holie religious men, and others, and to the voice of the people (which is Gods voice) that God ment to puniſh theſe Princes ſo viſibly that euery man might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, to warne thereby all other Princes to liue well, and according to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. For theſe Princes of Arragon loſt both honor and realme, with great riches &amp; goodly furniture of diuers and ſundry ſorts, the which is ſo diſperſed heere and there, that a man can hardly tell what is become thereof: beſides that, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their liues three in a yeeres ſpace or little more (but I truſt their ſoules be in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.) For you ſhall vnderſtand that this old <hi>Ferrande</hi> (baſtard to King <hi>Alphonſe,</hi> a wiſe, vertuous and honorable Prince) was maruellouſly diſquieted when he ſaw this French war firſt mooued againſt him, which he could finde no meanes to pacifie. For he was wiſe and knew that he and his ſonne had liued ill, and were maruellouſly hated in their realme: diuers alſo of thoſe that were neereſt about him haue informed me, that as he raced a certain chappell, he found a booke whereon theſe words were written; <hi>Truth vvith hir ſecret counſell</hi> 
                  <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP11.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref>; the which contained all the euils that afterward fell vpon him. There were but three that ſawe the booke, for immediately after he had read it, he threw it into the fire. Another thing that greatly troubled him was this, his ſonne <hi>Alphonſe</hi> and <hi>Ferrand</hi> his ſonnes ſonne, could neuer be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the King would come into Italy. Wherefore they vſed proude and threatning words againſt him, and ſpake very contemptuouſly of him, ſaying, they would go as far as the mountaines to meete him. But one that ſtood by, wiſhed that neuer King of Fraunce might come into Italy, for he had ſeene a poore man of the houſe of Aniou ſcourge it ſhrewdly, meaning Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> ſonne to King René. King <hi>Ferrand</hi> had trauelled very earneſtly the yeere before, by his ambaſſador called <hi>Camillo Pendolfo,</hi> to ſtay the King in Fraunce, offering to pay him yeerely a tribute of fiftie thouſand ducats, and to holde the realme of him by homage and fealty. But when he ſaw that he could by no meanes obtaine peace, nor pacifie the eſtate of Milan, he fell into the diſeaſe whereof he died: notwithſtanding in the midſt of his pangues he confeſſed himſelfe, and as I truſt repented him of his ſinnes. His ſonne <hi>Alphonſe</hi> who had been ſo terrible a Prince, ſo cruell, and ſo long trained vp in the wars, before the King departed from Rome, reſigned his crowne, and was ſtroken with ſuch feare, that in the night he neuer ceaſed to crie, That he heard the French
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7649:158"/>
men comming, and that the trees and ſtones ſounded Fraunce. He neuer was ſo hardie as once to iſſue foorth of Naples, but vpon his ſonnes returne from Rome, put him in poſſeſſion of the realme, and cauſed him to be crowned, and to ride about the ſtreets of the citie accompanied with the noblieſt perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages that were there, namely, with Dom <hi>Frederick</hi> his brother, and the Cardinall of Genua (between whom the new K. rode) and with the ambaſſadors there reſident. He cauſed alſo all other ſolemnities belonging to the coronation to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, &amp; then fled himſelfe &amp; ſailed into Sicily with his mother in law (ſiſter to K. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand</hi> of caſtile now raigning, to whom the ſaid realm of Sicily was in ſubiection) to a houſe that ſhe had there: which was ſtrang news through the whole world, eſpecially at Venice where I then was. Some ſaid he went to the Turke; others thought his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to be, to the end his ſon who was not hated in the realme, might the better win the harts of the people. But mine opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was euer that he fled for very cowardiſe: for a cruel man was neuer hardy, as appeereth in hiſtories by <hi>Nero</hi> &amp; others, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their death fel into great feare and deſperation. To be ſhort, this <hi>Alphonſe</hi> made ſuch haſte to be gone, that he ſaid to his mother in law the ſelfe ſame daie that they departed (as diuers of his ſeruants haue told me,) that vnleſſe ſhe would depart with ſpeede, he would leaue hir behinde him. And when ſhe deſired him to ſtaie but three daies onely, to the end ſhe <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP11.NOTE6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> might be a whole yeere in his realme: he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that rather than he would tarie any longer he would throw himſelfe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long out at the windowes, asking hir if ſhe heard not how euery man cried <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Thus he embarked in his Gallies with his ſaid mother in law and departed, carieng with him all ſorts of wines, (whereunto he was maruellouſly giuen,) and of all kinds of ſeeds for gardens. But as touching his mooueables and goods he left no order for them, but the greateſt part remained in the caſtle of Naples: notwithſtanding certaine iewels he carried alſo with him, and a little money. And in this eſtate ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led he and his mother in lawe to hir ſaid houſe in Sicilie, whence he departed and went to Meſſine, whither he called and led with him diuers religious men, vowing himſelfe to be no more of this world. Aboue all other orders of religion he loued eſpecially thoſe of the Mount Oliuet (who are clad in white) as they themſelues told me at Venice, where the body of Saint <hi>Heleine</hi> lieth in their cloiſter. Moreouer, he began to lead a maruellous holie life, &amp; to ſerue God howerly both daie &amp; night with the ſaid religious men as they do in their couents. He vſed alſo great feaſting, abſtinence, and almes, and ſoone after fell into a ſharpe ſicknes of excoriation and the ſtone, in ſuch ſort that the ſaid religious men reported that they neuer ſaw man ſo tormented. Notwithſtanding he endured patiently all theſe pangues, being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolued to haue ſpent the reſt of his life in an Abbey at Valence the great in Spaine, &amp; there to haue regiſtred himſelfe a religious man. But he was ſo tormented with this diſeaſe, that he died ſoone after: and it is to be hoped bicauſe of his great repentance, that his ſoule is ioifull in Paradiſe: his ſonne alſo died ſoone after him of an ague ioyned with a fluxe, and I truſt they are both in better caſe then they were in this world. But marke heere by the waie that in leſſe than two yeeres ſpace, fiue wore the crowne of Naples, to with the three aboue named, <hi>Charles</hi> the 8.

               <p>The King was yet at Rome, where he remained about twenty daies buſied with a number of matters. He had with him at the leaſt eighteene Cardinals, beſides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others that repaired to the citie from all parts.

The place was not of defence, for the ſeate thereof is vpon a little hill made by force of man: beſides that, theſe Cardinals alleaged that the wals thereof were fallen down by miracle, and charged the Pope that he had obtained this holy dignitie by ſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and they ſaid true; but Cardinall <hi>Aſcaigne</hi> himſelfe was the chiefe merchaunt that ſolde it, and receiued a great ſumme of money for his part, togither with the Popes houſe where he lodged before he was Pope, being then Vicechauncellor, and all the furniture thereof, and his ſaid office of Vicechauncellor, with diuers places of the patrimonie of the Church.

Notwithſtanding I thinke they would both willingly haue agreede to chuſe a newe Pope of the Kings naming, yea and a French man; ſo that I know not whether the King did well or euill in concluding peace, though all things conſidered I ſuppoſe he tooke the beſt courſe: for himſelfe was yoong, and vnprouided of men ſufficient to manage ſo waightie a matter as the reformation of the Church, though I confeſſe his power to haue been ſufficient thereunto. Sure if he could haue reformed it, I thinke al men of wiſedome and vnderſtanding would haue accounted it a good, a woorthie, and a holie worke. But there were too many things requiſite to ſo high an enterpriſe, notwithſtanding the Kings will was good, and yet is if he had good aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The King being in Rome made a treatie with the Pope, which could not long endure, for it was vnreaſonable in ſome points, and ſerued for the chiefe colour of the league, whereof heereafter you ſhall heare.

All the which places the King ſware to reſtore at his returne from Naples, as alſo he did notwithſtanding that the Pope had abuſed him. By this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he deliuered alſo into the Kings hands the Truks brother: for the ſafe keeping of whom he receiued yeerely of the Turke ſixtie thouſand ducats, and held him alſo by meanes of his ſaid brother in great feare <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP12.NOTE5">

Certaine other articles there were touching the conſiſtorie or college of Cardinals which I ouerpaſſe. For the performance of all theſe conditions, the Pope deliuered his ſonne the Cardinall of Valence in hoſtage to the King, who accompanied him as his Legate, and the King did vnto the Pope the dutie of a ſonne, with all humilitie and obedience. Further, the Pope created two Cardinals at his requeſt, the one the generall <hi>Briſſonnet,</hi> ſo often before named, lately made biſhop of Saint Malo, and the other the biſhop of Mans, of the houſe of Luxembourg, who was heere in Fraunce.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe matters being thus ended, the King remooued from Rome, in great amity &amp; friendſhip with the Pope in apparance, at which time eight Cardinals departed alſo out of the citie highly diſpleaſed with this treatie, namely the ſaid Vicechaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Aſcaigne,</hi> and the Cardinall S. <hi>Peter-ad-Vincula,</hi> with ſixe of their faction.

From Rome the King remooued to Ianneſanne, and from thence to Beliſtre, where the Cardinall of Valence eſcaped away.</p>
               <p>The next daie the King tooke Chaſtelfortin by aſſault and put all that were with in it to the ſword, bicauſe the place belonged to <hi>Iames Comte</hi> who was reuolted from the King, notwithſtanding that he had taken his pay: for the <hi>Comtes</hi> haue euer been partakers with the <hi>Vrſins.</hi> From thence he marched to Valmonton a town of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnois, and from thence remooued and lodged about fower miles from mont Saint Iehan, which is a towne held of the Church, but belonging to the Marques of Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caire and very well fortified: notwithſtanding after it had beene beaten ſeauen or eight howers with the cannon; it was taken by aſſault, and all that were within it or the greateſt partſlaine, and there the Kings whole force ioyned togither <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP13.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>. Then he marched towards Saint Germain ſixteen miles thence, where this newe King <hi>Ferrande</hi> (as you haue heard) laie in campe with all the force he could leuy. And indeed this was his onely refuge, and the place where he muſt fight or neuer, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the verie keie as it were of his realme, and a place much for his aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as well bicauſe of the riuer as of the mountaine. Further, he had ſent men to defend the ſtraight of Cancello, lying among the mountaines ſixe miles from Saint Germain: yet notwithſtanding all this preparation before the Kings arriuall at S.

               <p>Our vaward was led that day by the L. of Guiſe, the L. of Rieux was ſent to this ſtrait of Cancello againſt the Arragonnois, but they alſo before his comming aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the place: and then entered the King into S.

K. <hi>Ferrande</hi> rid ſtraight to Capoua, where they refuſed to giue his ſoldiers entrance, but receiued his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with a fewe that attended vpon him; he ſtaied not there, but deſired them to continue true and faithfull ſubiects to him, promiſing the next daie to returne, and ſo departed towards Naples fearing the rebellion that afterwards happened. All his force or the greateſt part ſhould haue tarried him at Capoua: but the next daie when he returned he found them all departed. The Lord <hi>Virgile Vrſin</hi> with his coſin the Earle of Petillane, went to Nola, where they and all their company were taken priſoners by our men. They alleaged that they had a ſafe conduct and that we did them wrong, ſo had they indeed, but their ſafe conduct was not yet in their hands: notwithſtanding they paied no ranſome, but much they loſt when they were

taken, and ſure in mine opinion they had wrong done them.</p>
               <p>From Saint Germain the King remooued to Mingamer, and to Triague, and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at Calui, two miles from Capoua, whither they of Capoua came and yeelded themſelues by compoſition, and the King entered into the towne with his whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

The King offered him poſſeſſions in Fraunce both for him and his nephew, and I thinke would willingly haue giuen them a good and a great Duchie: but they would not accept this offer, neither would he grant their demands. For what treatie ſoeuer had been made, they would haue broken it, when they had ſeen their aduantage, being ſtill reſident in the realme. The Kings artillerie was bent and ſhot againſt the caſtle of Naples, within the which were onely the Almaines, for the Marques of Peſcare was departed thence.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will now leaue the King in Naples, hauing atchieued his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and will ſpeake ſomewhat of the Venetians, and the cauſe of mine ambaſſage thither. My departure from Aſt to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice was, partly to thanke them for the good anſwers they had made to two of the Kings ambaſſadors ſent thither, and partly to keepe them ſtill his friends, if it were poſſible by any meanes: for bicauſe of their great forces, wiſedome, and good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they might eaſily haue mated his enterpriſe in Italie; but they being his friends, none in the countrie were to be feared. The Duke of Milan helped to diſpatch me, and wrote to his ambaſſador there reſident (for he hath one there continually) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie me, and to giue me inſtructions to whom I ſhould addreſſe my ſelfe. His ſaid ambaſſador receiued monethly of the Seniorie an hundred ducats, and had his houſe well furniſhed, and three barges (at their charge) to conuay him vp and downe the towne. Their ambaſſador hath the like allowance at Milan, ſaue that he hath no barge; for at Milan men ride altogither on horſebacke, but at Venice they are caried by bote. In my iournie thitherward, I paſſed through their cities, namely Breſſe, Veronne, Vincenſe, and Padua, with diuers others; at euery one of the which I was very honorably entertained, bicauſe of the perſonage I repreſented: for alwaies ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the poteſtate or the captaine came to receiue me, accompanied with a goodly traine: but they both iſſued neuer foorth of the towne; for the captaine vſed to come
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7649:162"/>
no further than the gate. After I was entred the towne, they conuaied me to my lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, commanding the hoſt that I ſhould be plentifully ſerued, and all my charges they defraied, entertaining me with very honorable words. But if a man conſider what he muſt beſtowe vpon drums and trumpets, he ſaueth not much though he lie vpon free coſt, notwithſtanding the entertainment is very honorable. The ſame day I entred into Venice, they ſent as far as Chafouſine <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> to receiue me, which is a place fiue miles from the towne, where men leaue the botes that conuay them downe the riuer from Padua <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>, and enter into other little botes very proper and neate, couered with tapeſtrie, and furniſhed within, with goodly hangings and veluet cuſhions to ſit vpon. Thus far the ſea floweth, and this is the neereſt paſſage from the firme land to Venice: but their ſea is maruellous calme (vnles a tempeſt happen to ariſe) which is the cauſe that ſo great plenty of all kinde of fiſh is taken there. I woondred to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſeate of this citie, ſo many ſteeples, ſo many religious houſes, and ſo much building, and all in the water; but eſpecially that the people had none other paſſage to &amp; fro in the town but by botes, wherof I thinke there are to the number of 30000. but they be very ſmall. Further, about the citie (I meane within the compas round about of leſſe than halfe a French league) are 70. houſes of religion, as well of men as women, all in Ilands ſumptuouſly built, richly furniſhed within, and hauing good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gardens belonging to them. Thoſe within the citie I comprehend not in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; for within, there are, beſides theſe, the fower orders of friers, and threeſcore and twelue pariſhes, beſides a number of chappels of the companies of occupations, commonly called <hi>Confrairies</hi> 
                  <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>. And ſure it is a ſtrange ſight to behold ſo many great and goodly churches built in the ſea. To the ſaid place of Chafouſine came fiue and twenty gentlemen to receiue me, ſumptuouſly apparelled in ſilke and ſcarlet, the which welcommed me with an oration, &amp; conuaied me to the church of Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew neere to the towne, where as many other gentlemen met me, being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the ambaſſadors of Milan and Ferrara: and heere alſo they receiued me with an oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; afterwards led me into other botes which they call flat, being much greater than the former, two of them were couered with crimoſin ſattin, and decked within with arras, ech of them being large inough to haue receiued 40. perſons. They placed me between theſe two ambaſſadors, (for the midſt in Italy is the honorableſt place) and conuaied me along through the great ſtreete called the great chanell <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref>, which is ſo large that the gallies paſſe to &amp; fro through it, yea I haue ſeen hard by the houſes ſhips of foure hundred tun and aboue. Sure in mine opinion it is the goodlieſt ſtreet in the world and the beſt built, and reacheth in length from the one end of the towne to the other. Their buildings are high and ſtately, and all of fine ſtone <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref>. The ancient houſes be all painted; but the reſt that haue been built within theſe hundred yeeres, haue their front all of white marble, brought thither out of Iſtria an hundred miles thence, and are beautified with many great peeces of Porphire <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE6">

                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref>. In the moſt part of them are at the leaſt two chambers, the ſeeling whereof is gilded, the mantletrees of the chimneies very rich, to wit, of grauen marble, the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteds gilded, the preſſes painted and vermiled with golde, and maruellous well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſtuffe. To be ſhort, it is the moſt triumphant citie that euer I ſawe, and where ambaſſadors and ſtrangers are moſt honorably entertained, the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth beſt gouerned, and God moſt deuoutly ſerued; ſo far foorth, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they haue diuers imperfections, yet thinke I verily that God proſpereth them, bicauſe of the reuerence they beare to the ſeruice of the Church. In the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of theſe fiftie gentlemen I paſſed to Saint Georges, which is an abbey of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med blacke monks where I lodged. The next day they returned againe to me, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7649:163"/>
led me to the Seniorie, where I deliuered my letters to the Duke, who preſideth in all their aſſemblies, being honored as a King <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref>, and all letters are directed to him, but of himſelfe he cannot do much. Notwithanding this Duke is of great authoritie, yea greater than euer was any of his predeceſſors <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE9">

                     <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                  </ref>: and for my part I euer found him a vertuous and a wiſe man, of great experience in the affaires of Italie, and a courteous and gentle perſon. This was all that I did the firſt day, ſaue that they led me into the palace, and ſhewed me three or fower chambers, the feelings whereof were richly gilded, and likewiſe the beds and preſſes: and ſure it is a very ſtately and ſumptuous building for the greatnes thereof: for it is all of ſquare marble, and all the front vermiled with gold, and likewiſe the edges and borders of the angles, about the bredth of an inch. There are moreouer fower goodly hals within it richly gilded, and a number of faire lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, but the court is very ſmall. The Duke out of his chamber may heare maſſe at the high altar of the chappell of Saint Marke <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE11">
                     <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
                  </ref>, which is the goodlieſt and richeſt church in the world, bearing but the name of a chappell: for it is built throughout of the curious worke called Muſaique, or Marqueterie <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE12">
                     <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                  </ref>; the art alſo whereof they vaunt themſelues to be authors of: and ſure they haue diuers workmen thereof, as I my ſelfe can teſtifie. In this chappell is their treaſure ſo famous through the world, being onely things appointed for the furniture of the church; among the which are twelue or fowerteene Rubie ballais, the greateſt that euer I ſaw: for two of them waigh the one aboue ſeuen hundred, and the other aboue eight hundred carrets, but they are vnpoliſhed. There are twelue other ſtones like to little pillers ſet in gold, and garniſhed and bordred with excellent good ſtone. Moreouer, twelue crownes there are of golde, wherewith in times paſt at certaine feaſts in the yeere twelue women decked themſelues (whom they called Queenes) the which went about theſe ylands and churches: but the ſaid Queenes, and the greateſt part of the women of the citie, were ſtolen and caried away perforce by theeues that came out of Iſtria or Friole <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE13">
                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                  </ref>, being borderers vpon the Venetians, the which lurked priuily behinde theſe yles: but their husbands purſued theſe theeues, and recouered their women, and offered all theſe crownes to Saint Marke, and built alſo a chappell vpon the place, whither the Seniorie reſorteth yeerely the ſame day they obtained this victorie. Sure this is a goodly furniture for the church: for beſides theſe things aboue rehearſed, there are diuers other iewels of gold, and a ſute of Amethiſts and Agates, &amp; a few Emeraulds. But this is no ſuch treaſure to make account of as ready monie; and yet of monie they haue no treaſure: for the Duke himſelfe told me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Seniorie, that it is among them a capitall crime to make mention of treaſure in coine. And ſure in mine opinion they do therein very wiſely, for feare of diuiſion that thereby might ariſe among them. Afterward they ſhewed me their treaſure, namely their Arſenal <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE14">
                     <hi rend="sup">14</hi>
                  </ref>, where they arme their gallies, and prepare all other furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture neceſſary for their nauie, which vndoubtedly is the goodlieſt thing at this day in the world, and the beſt in order for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, I abode there eight moneths vpon their charge, as did all the other ambaſſadors there reſident. And ſure thus much I dare boldly ſay of them, that they are men of ſuch wiſdome, and ſo inclined to inlarge their dominions, that vnleſſe they be looked to in time, all their neighbors ſhall repent it too late: for the Kings comming into Italy, and the wars that haue been betweene him and them ſince that time (which yet endure) haue made them much skilfuller in fortification and defence of places euer they were before. Beſides that, they haue of late enlarged their Seniorie, for they haue ſeuen or eight cities engaged to them in Pouille, which I
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7649:163"/>
doubt me they will neuer reſtore. At the Kings firſt comming into Italy they could not be perſwaded that places might be taken ſo eaſily, and in ſo ſhort ſpace: for they made not war with ſuch expedition <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE15">
                     <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                  </ref>; but both they and diuers others haue forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſince, and do daily fortifie many places in Italy. They cannot grow mightie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden as the Romaines did, for their bodies cannot endure ſuch labor and trauell as theirs could, bicauſe they are vnaccuſtomed therunto, by reaſon that none of them go into their wars vpon the firme land <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE16">
                     <hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                  </ref>; aſſiſt him with their counſell, and prouide all things neceſſary for their armie. True it is that their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vpon the ſea are led <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE18">

Moreouer, another good order haue they as touching theſe prouiſors whom they ſend in perſon with their armies vpon the land, whichis, that they imploie in that ſeruice no man of ſuch courage and vertue as may ſeeme woorthy to be their Prince (as the Romaines did) whereby they auoid all factions in the citie, which ſure is a great point of wiſedome. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly againſt ciuill contention they haue maruellouſly well prouided diuers and ſundry other waies, for they haue no Tribunes of the people, as they had in Rome, which partly were cauſe of their ruine. But the people at Venice beare no ſwaie, neither are called to counſell in any matter <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE19">

                  </ref>. And the greateſt part of their people be ſtrangers. Moreouer, they vnderſtand by <hi>T. Liuius</hi> what imperfections were in the ſtate of Rome; for they haue his hiſtorie, and his body lieth buried in their palace at Padua. For theſe reaſons and diuers others which I could alleage, I ſay yet once againe, that they are in the way to be great Lords in time to come.</p>
               <p>I muſt now declare the cauſe of mine ambaſſage to them, which was, to thanke them for the good anſwers they had made to two ambaſſadors ſent thither by the King: and for the good comfort they had giuen him, in willing him vpon their word to proceede with his enterpriſe. All the which was done before he departed out of Aſt. At my arriuall I diſcourſed vnto them of the ancient league that had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Kings of Fraunce and them. And further, I offered them Brandis and the towne of Orante, vnder this condition, that when we deliuered them better townes in Greece, they ſhould be bound to reſtore theſe. They vſed very honorable termes both of the King and his affaires, ſuppoſing that he could not enter far into Italie. And as touching the offer I made, they anſwered that they were his friends and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and would not ſell him their friendſhip, (and in deede as yet we had not the places offered.) Further they ſaid, that they had force ſufficient in a readines to moue war againſt him, if they were ſo diſpoſed, but they would not ſo do; notwithſtanding that the ambaſſador of Naples daily ſollicited them thereunto, and offered them in conſideration thereof, whatſoeuer they would demaund. Moreouer, King <hi>Alphonſe</hi> (who then raigned) confeſſed that he had many waies misbehaued himſelfe towards them, and declared vnto them the great danger themſelues ſhould be in, if the King obtained his purpoſe. The Turke on the other ſide ſent an ambaſſador to them with all ſpeede, (whom I my ſelfe ſaw diuers times) the which at the Popes requeſt threatened them, vnleſſe they declared themſelues the Kings enimies. They gaue euery one of theſe good anſwers, notwithſtanding at the firſt they ſtood in no feare of vs, but laughed at our voiage: and the rather bicauſe the Duke of Milan ſent them word by his ambaſſador, that they ſhould not trouble themſelues about this enterpriſe: for he would finde meanes to ſend the King home with emptie hands. The like meſſage ſent he alſo to <hi>Peter</hi> of Medicis, as himſelfe told me. But when both
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7649:164"/>
they and the Duke of Milan ſawe all the Florentines places, eſpecially Piſa in the Kings hands, they began to feare &amp; to conſult how to ſtop him from paſſing further: but their matters were long in debating, and in the meane time while ambaſſadors paſſed to and fro betweene them, the King marched forward. The King of Spaine in like maner began to feare, bicauſe of the yles of Sicilie and Sardinia. And the King of Romaines enuied our Kings good ſucceſſe: for diuers there were that put him in doubt of the crowne imperiall, ſaying, that the King would take it, and had required the Pope to giue him leaue ſo to do, but this was moſt vntrue. Notwithſtanding for theſe doubts, theſe two Kings ſent honorable ambaſſages to Venice, I being there, as you haue heard. The King of Romaines, bicauſe he was their neighbor, ſent firſt: the principall of his ambaſſage was the Biſhop of Trente, accompanied with two knights and a doctor of the law: they were very honorably and ſolemnly receiued, and their lodgings made and furniſhed as mine. Moreouer, they had ten ducats a day allowed them for their diet, and their horſes which they had left behinde them at Treuis, were kept vpon the Seniories charge. Soone after arriued alſo a worſhipfull knight of Spaine <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE22">
                     <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                  </ref> well accompanied and well apparelled, who was in like maner honorably receiued, and his charges defraied. The Duke of Milan, beſides his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador there reſident, ſent thither the biſhop of Come, and Maſter <hi>Francis Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> Viſcount, all the which began at the firſt to negotiate togither couertly and in the night by their Secretaries: for they durſt not as yet openly diſcouer themſelues againſt the King, eſpecially the Duke of Milan and the Venetians, bicauſe they doubted what ſucceſſe the league which was in communication ſhould haue. Theſe ambaſſadors of Milan came to viſite me, and brought me letters from their Maſter, pretending that they were come, bicauſe the Venetians had ſent two ambaſſadors to Milan, whereas they were woont to haue but one reſident there: no more had they in the end; and this was but a colour of their lying, deceit, and falſe dealing: for they were all aſſembled togither to conclude a league againſt the good King, but ſo many ſtrings could not be tuned on a ſudden. They deſired me afterward (if I could) to informe them what the cauſe was of the King of Spaines and the King of Romanes ambaſſadors arriuall, to the end they might aduertiſe their Maſter thereof. But I had intelligence already from diuers places, both by the ſaid ambaſſadors ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and others, that the ambaſſador of Spaine had paſſed through Milan diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the Almaines gouerned their affaires wholy by the Duke of Milans coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and aduice, and that the ambaſſador of Naples deliuered howerly packets of letters from his Maſter. For you muſt vnderſtand, that the treatie of their league was begun before the King departed from Florence, and I ſpent monie largely to haue intelligence of all their doings, and wrought by good inſtruments, ſo that I knew already all their articles, which were propounded but not agreed vpon: for the Venetians are very long in their reſolutions. For theſe cauſes I ſeeing the league in ſuch forwardnes, would no longer pretend ignorance therein, but anſwered theſe ambaſſadors of Milan, that ſith they vſed ſuch ſtrange termes to me, I thought good to ſay thus much vnto them, that the King would not loſe the D. of Milans friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip if by any meanes it might be kept, and that I as his ſeruant would do my dutie to my Maſter, and excuſe him of the euil reports which peraduenture had been made of him to the Duke their Maſter, who I thought was miſinformed: ſaying further, that he ought well to bethinke himſelfe, before he loſt the recompence of the great ſeruice he had done the King: for the Kings of Fraunce were neuer ingrate; adding alſo, that the ſpeaking of a fooliſh word ought not to diſſolue their friendſhip, the continuance whereof was ſo neceſſarie for them both. Wherefore I deſired them to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:7649:164"/>
open vnto me their griefes, that I might aduertiſe the King thereof before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further: they ſware all vnto me and proteſted, that there was no ſuch matter as I imagined; but they lied, for they were come thither to treat of the ſaid league.</p>
               <p>The next day I went to the Seniorie to commune with them about their league, and to tell them my opinion thereof. Among other things I alleaged, that by the league concluded betweene the King and them, and the late King <hi>Lewis</hi> his father and them, they might not maintaine the one the others enimies: wherefore they could not conclude the league now treated of without breach of their promiſe. Then they cauſed me to withdraw my ſelfe a little, and at my returne the Duke ſaide vnto me, that I muſt not beleeue all that I heard in the towne: for all men liued there in libertie, and might ſpeake what them liſted; and that as touching them they neuer meant to enter into league againſt the King, neither heard euer of any ſuch matter: but on the contrarie ſide they ſought to conclude a league betweene the King, and theſe two other Kings and all Italy, againſt the Turke, at the common charges of them all, and that if any in Italy refuſed to pay that he ſhould be rated at, the King and they would conſtraine him thereunto by force. Moreouer, they ſaid that they trauelled to conclude a good peace for the King, to wit, that he ſhould receiue of Dom <hi>Ferrand</hi> preſently a ſumme of money, which they offered to lend, ſo that they might haue engaged for it, thoſe places in Pouille which now they poſſeſſe, and that the realme ſhould be held of the King by the Popes conſent <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE23">
                     <hi rend="sup">23</hi>
                  </ref>, and pay him yeerely a certaine tribute. And further, that he ſhould hold in it three places, and I would to God the King would then haue giuen eare to this offer: but I anſwered them that I durſt not deale therein, bicauſe I had no commiſſion nor authoritie ſo to do. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, I deſired them not to be haſtie in concluding this league, bicauſe I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe the King of theſe their ouertures. I required them alſo (as I had done the others) to open vnto me their griefes, and not to diſſemble them as they of Milan had done. Then they told me plainly that they were greeued bicauſe the King held certaine of the Popes townes, but much more bicauſe of the Florentines places, eſpecially Piſa, ſaying, that the King himſelfe had written both vnto them and diuers others, that he would take nothing in Italy, but the realme of Naples onely, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward go againſt the Turke: but now it plainly appeered that he would conquere all that he could in Italy, and leaue the Turke in peace. They ſaid further, that the Duke of Orleans (whom the King had left behinde him in Aſt) put the D. of Milan in great doubt and feare, and that his ſeruants vſed maruellous threatning words againſt him. Notwithſtanding they promiſed to conclude nothing before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued anſwer from the King, at the leaſt not before a conuenient time to receiue anſwer were expired, and they dealt more honorably with me than they of Milan had done <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE24">
                     <hi rend="sup">24</hi>
                  </ref>. Of all theſe matters I aduertiſed the King, and receiued a cold anſwer from him: from that daie forward they began daily to aſſemble togither, bicauſe they knew their enterpriſe to be diſcouered. The King was yet at Florence, and if he had found any reſiſtance at Viterbe (as they thought he ſhould) they would haue ſent men to defend Rome: yea or if King <hi>Ferrand</hi> had not abandoned Rome, as they thought vndoubtedly he would neuer haue done: but when they heard of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thence they began to feare. Notwithſtanding the ambaſſadors of theſe two Kings preſſed them earneſtly to conclude, ſaying, that otherwiſe they would depart, for they had been there fower moneths daily negotiating with the Seniorie. In the meane time I labored all that might be to ouerthrow their league.</p>
               <p>But when the Venetians ſaw all theſe places yeelded, and were alſo aduertiſed, that the King was entred into Naples, they ſent for me, and told me theſe newes,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7649:165"/>
ſeeming greatly to reioice thereat: notwithſtanding they ſaid that the caſtell was very wel furniſhed, and I perceiued by them, that they hoped aſſuredly it would haue held good. Moreouer, they licenſed the ambaſſador of Naples to leuie men at Venice to ſend to Brandis; and they were euen vpon the point to haue concluded their league, when ſuddenly they receiued letters from their ambaſſadors, that the caſtell was yeelded alſo to the King. Then they ſent for me againe in a morning, and I found fiftie or ſixtie of them aſſembled togither in the Dukes chamber, who lay ſick of the collicke. He told me theſe newes with a cheerfull countenance, but none of the reſt could diſſemble ſo cunningly as himſelfe: for ſome of them ſate vpon a lowe bench leaning vpon their elbowes, other ſome after one ſort, and others after another; their outward countenances bewraying their inward griefe. And I thinke verily when word came to Rome of the battell loſt at Cannas againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors which remained in the citie, were not more aſtoniſhed nor troubled than theſe: for none of them once looked vpon me, none of them gaue me one word but the Duke alone; ſo that I woondred to behold them. The Duke asked me if the King would performe that which he had alwaies promiſed both by his letters and by me: I aſſured him that he would, and opened certaine ouertures of peace, and offered my ſelfe to trauell therein, truſting to put them out of all doubt, and ſo departed.</p>
               <p>Their league was as yet neither fully concluded, nor fully broken off; for the which cauſe the Almaines would needes haue departed in great heate. The Duke of Milan would not yet condeſcend I wot not to which of their articles: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the end he ſent word to his ambaſſadors to ſeale with ſpeede to all; and thus at the length was their league concluded. During the ſpace that theſe practiſes were thus entertained among them, I had from time to time aduertiſed the King of them all, preſſing him earneſtly to reſolue either to tarrie in the realme, and to make proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of greater forces of footemen and money; or in time to retire homeward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his enimies were all aſſembled, leauing the principall places well manned. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed alſo the D. of Orleans (who lay in Aſt with his houſhold ſeruants onely, for his companie was with the King) of all that was done, willing him to put men into the towne, and aſſuring him that they would incontinent aſſaile him. I wrote alſo to the Duke of Bourbon (whom the King had left regent in Fraunce) to ſend men to Aſt with all ſpeede poſſible to defend the towne, bicauſe that place being loſt, no aide could come to the King. In like maner I aduertiſed the Marchioneſſe of Montferrat of all theſe proceedings (who was a great friend to vs, and deadly enimy to the Duke of Milan) to the end ſhe might aide the Duke of Orleans with men, if neede ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for Aſt being loſt, the Marquiſats of Montferrat and Saluces were alſo loſt.</p>
               <p>Their league was concluded one night very late <ref target="#S5602.BK7.CHAP15.NOTE25">
                     <hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                  </ref>. The next morning the Senio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſent for me earlier then they were accuſtomed. And when I was come and ſet downe, the Duke told me, that in the honor of the holy Trinitie, there was a league concluded betweene our holy father the Pope, the Kings of Romaines and Caſtile, them, and the Duke of Milan, for three purpoſes. The firſt, for the defence of the eſtate of Chriſtendome againſt the Turke; the ſecond, for the defence of Italy; and the third for the preſeruation of their own eſtates, whereof he willed me to aduertiſe the King. They were aſſembled to the number of a hundred or more, and looked vp with cheerfull countenances, and ſate not as they did the day they aduertiſed me of the taking of the caſtle of Naples. The Duke tolde me moreouer that they had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to their ambaſſadors that were with the King, to take their leaue and to returne home, their names were Maſter <hi>Dominic Loredan,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Dominic Treuiſan.</hi> I was maruellouſly troubled with this newes, for I ſtood in doubt both of the Kings
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7649:165"/>
perſon, and of all his companie, ſuppoſing their armie to haue been readier than in deed it was, as did themſelues alſo. I feared further leaſt the Almaines had been at hand; and not without cauſe; for if they had, vndoubtedly the King had neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of Italy. I was reſolued not to ſpeake much in this heate; but they ſo prouoked me that I was forced to change my minde; and then I ſaid vnto them, that both the night before and diuers other times, I had aduertiſed the King of their league, and that he alſo had ſent me word that he had intelligence thereof both from Rome and from Milan. They looked all maruellous ſtrangely vpon me, when I ſaid that I had aduertiſed the King thereof the night before: for there is no nation vnder the ſunne ſo ſuſpicious as they, nor ſo ſecret in their affaires, ſo that oftentimes they baniſh men vpon ſuſpicion onely, for the which cauſe I ſaid thus much vnto them. I told them moreouer that I had ſent word thereof both to the Duke of Orleans and to the Duke of Bourbon, to the end they might put men into Aſt: which words I vttered hoping to delay their going thither. For if they had indeed been as ready as they vaunted and ſuppoſed themſelues to haue been: they muſt needs haue taken the towne, for it was vnmanned both then and long after. Then they told me that they meant not to attempt ought againſt the King, but onely to defend themſelues, adding that they would not haue him thus to abuſe the world with words, in ſaying that he would nothing but the realme of Naples, and afterward go againſt the Turk: and yet do cleane contrary, and ſeeke to deſtroy the Duke of Milan, and the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and hold alſo the places of the Church. Wherunto I anſwered that the Kings of Fraunce had euer inlarged &amp; augmented the dition of the church, and defended it, and that the King my Maſter would rather do the like than the contrarie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe (I ſaid) were not the reaſons that mooued them to enter into this war, but that they deſired to trouble the eſtate of Italy, thereby to make their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as in the end I thought they would; which words they tooke in euill part as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I was aduertiſed: notwithſtanding it appeereth by thoſe townes in Pouile which they haue in gage of King <hi>Ferrand</hi> to aide him againſt vs, that I ſaid true. At this inſtant I would haue riſen to depart, but they cauſed me to ſit downe again, and then the Duke asked me if I would make any ouerture of peace, bicauſe the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had offered ſo to do, but that was vnder condition that they ſhould haue ſtaid the concluſion of their league fifteene daies, to the end I might aduertiſe the King thereof, and receiue his anſwer thereunto. Our communication being ended, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my lodging, &amp; then they ſent for the ambaſſadors of the league one after another, and as I came foorth from them I met with the ambaſſador of Naples, who ware a faire new gowne and ſhewed a cheerefull countenance, ſo had he great cauſe to do, for theſe were good newes for him. After dinner all the ambaſſadors of the league accompanied with their ſeruants met togither, at the charges of the Seniory, vpon the water (which is all the paſtime of Venice) I thinke they were in all fortie boates, euery ambaſſador hauing his boate garniſhed with a flagge of his Maſters armes. I ſaw all this company paſſe vnderneath my window with goodly melodie. And the ambaſſadors of Milan (at the leaſt one of them) who had been woont verie often before to beare me companie; made a countenance now as though he knew me no more. By the ſpace of three daies I neuer ſtirred out of my lodging, neither any of my ſeruants: notwithſtanding that, not one man in the towne gaue me or any of mine a foule word at any time. The ſame night they made great paſtime with ſquibs, which were ſet on fire a high in the ſteeples and turrets of the towne, and a number of torches were lighted in the top of theſe ambaſſadors houſes, and diuers peeces of artillery diſcharged. I was in a couered barge vpon the water to behold
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7649:166"/>
all this triumph, about ten of the clocke at night, eſpecially before theſe ambaſſadors lodgings, where was banketting and great cheere: notwithſtanding this was not the greate feſtiuall day, on the which their league was proclaimed: for the Pope had giuen commandement that the proclamation thereof ſhould be deferred till Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunday, and that euery one of the confederated Princes when it ſhould be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the ambaſſadors that ſhould be preſent thereat, ſhould beare in their hands an oliue branch in token of peace and confederacie as he ſaid. He commanded further, that vpon that day it ſhould be proclaimed both in Spaine and in Almaine. Moreouer, at Venice they made a ſcaffold of wood, which they raiſed a great height from the ground, as they vſe to do vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Corpus Chriſti day, &amp; it was richly hanged, and reached from the palace to the end of the market place of Saint Marke. Vpon this ſcaffold (after the Popes ambaſſador had ſoong maſſe, and giuen full abſolution to all men that ſhould be preſent at the ſaid proclamation) they went on proceſſion, the Senators and the ambaſſadors being all very well apparelled: for vnto diuers of the ſaid ambaſſadors the ſeniorie had giuen crimoſin veluet gowns, eſpecially to the Almaines, and new gownes alſo to all their ſeruants, but they were very ſhort. After their returne from proceſſion, a great number of pageants and deuiſes were ſhewed, repreſenting firſt Italy, and then all theſe Kings and Princes, and the Queene of Spaine. And as they returned from beholding the ſaid pageants, at a Porphire ſtone where all their proclamations are made, they proclaimed the ſaid league, and the Turks ambaſſador hard it, ſtanding cloſe at a window, and hauing his diſpatch, ſaue that they ſtaied him to behold this triumph. At night he came to talke with me by meanes of a certaine Greeke, and was with me fower howers in my chamber, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very deſirous that his Prince and the King my Maſter might enter togither into amitie. I was twiſe inuited to this feaſt, but I excuſed my ſelfe. I remained in the towne about a moneth after this proclamation, being aſwell entertained as at my firſt arriuall. Afterward the King ſent for me, and I tooke my leaue and departed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſafely conueied by them, and vpon their charges to Ferrara, where the Duke came foorth and receiued me, and feaſted me two daies, and defraied me. The like did Maſter <hi>Iohn de Bentiuole</hi> at Bolonia, whither the Florentines ſent for me. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I departed thence and went to Florence there to abide the Kings comming, of whom I will now returne to ſpeake.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O continue the better this my hiſtorie, and to informe you of all that happened, I muſt now returne to ſpeake of the King, who from the time he entred into Naples till his departure thence, thought onely vpon ſports and pleaſures, &amp; thoſe that were about him vpon their owne priuate profit and gain: notwithſtanding his yong yeers excuſed him; but on their behalfe, no iuſt excuſe can be made: for he committed all his affaires to their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And if they had aduiſed him to leaue well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the countrie at his departure but three or fower caſtels onely, namely that of Caietta, and one or two more; yea but the caſtell of Naples alone (the prouiſion whereof he had giuen away as already you haue heard) the realme had neuer been loſt: for if the caſtell of Naples had been kept, the towne had neuer reuolted. So ſoone as he vnderſtood the league aboue mentioned to be concluded, he commanded his whole forces to repaire to him, and appointed fiue hundred men of armes French and 2500. Swiſſers <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP1.NOTE1">

                  </ref>, and a few French foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the defence of the realme, determining with the reſt to returne home the ſame way he came; but the confederates made preparation to ſtop his paſſage. The King of Spaine had ſent and daily did ſend certaine Carauels <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP1.NOTE2">

                  </ref> into Sicilie, the which notwithſtanding that they were but ſlenderly manned, had before the Kings departure, put men into Reges in Calabria neere to Sicilie. I had eftſoones aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the King that there they would land; for the ambaſſador of Naples had ſo infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me himſelfe, ſuppoſing they had already been landed: but if the King had ſent thither in time, he had taken the caſtell; for the towne held for him. Out of Sicilie came certaine bands alſo to Mantia and to Turpia, all through our owne fault, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we had ſent no forces thither. In like maner the towne of Otrante in Pouille (which had once ſet vp the armes of Fraunce) ſeeing the league concluded, and themſelues ſeated neere to Brandis and Gallipoli, and no meanes poſſible to leuie men to put into their towne, reared vp againe the armes of Arragon; and Dom <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> being at Brandis, ſent a garriſon thither. To be ſhort, fortune began now to frowne vpon vs, which but two moneths before ſo highly had fauored vs, in ſuch ſort, that through the whole realme they began to reuolt, as well bicauſe of the league, as alſo of the Kings departure, and the ſmall forces he left behinde him, which was nothing in reſpect of the number of ſoldiers, though diuers of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were of great valor. He appointed for his lieutenant generall in the ſaid
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7649:167"/>
realme, the Lord of Montpenſier of the houſe of Bourbon, a valiant and a hardy knight, but of no great ſenſe, and ſo careles, that he kept his bed euery day til noone. In Calabria he left the Lord of Aubigny a Scottiſh man borne, a vertuous, wiſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, &amp; a valiant knight, him he created high Conſtable of the realme, and gaue him (as before you haue heard) the Earldome of Acri, and the Marquiſat of Squil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazzo. He had made Lord great Chamberlaine of the realme at his firſt comming thither, the Seneſchall of Beaucaire, called <hi>Stephan de Vers,</hi> who was alſo captaine of Caietta, Duke of Nola, and Lord of diuers other ſeniories. Further, all the treaſure of the realme paſſed through his hands, ſo that his charge was much too waightie for him; but ſure he was well affected to the defence of the realme. He created the Lord Don <hi>Iulian Lorrain</hi> a Duke, and left him in the towne of Saint Angelo, where he behaued himſelfe paſſing well. He left in Manfredonia Maſter <hi>Gabriell</hi> of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulcon, a man of whom he made great account; and to all theſe he gaue goodly poſſeſſions: but this <hi>Gabriell</hi> behaued himſelfe very childiſhly; for at fower daies end he yeelded the towne for lacke of victuals: notwithſtanding that at his entrie into it he found it very well furniſhed; beſides that it was ſeated in a countrie aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with all kinde of graine. Diuers ſold all the prouiſion they found in the caſtels, and the report went that this <hi>Gabriell</hi> fled himſelfe, and left <hi>VVilliam</hi> of Vilneufue for defence of the towne, whom his owne ſeruants ſold to Dom <hi>Frederick,</hi> who put him into the gallies, where he remained a long time. At Tarente the King left <hi>George</hi> of Suilly, who carried himſelfe there very gallantly, and died of the plague: and this citie held for the King, till famine forced it to yeeld. In Aquila he left the bailife of Vitry, where he did great ſeruice: and in Abruzzo maſter <hi>Gracian des guerres,</hi> who likewiſe made good proofe of his valor there. They were all left vnfurniſhed of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: for order was giuen that they ſhould receiue their pay there, of the reuenues of the crowne, but all was too little. Notwithſtanding the K. left the Princes of Salerne and Biſignan very well appointed, who did him good ſeruice as long as they were able. He delt alſo very bountifully with the Coulonnois: for he granted them al their demaunds, &amp; put aboue thirty places into their hands &amp; their friends, which if they would haue defended for him, as both by dutie &amp; oth they were bound, they had don him great ſeruice, and purchaſed to themſelues both honor and profit. For I thinke they were not ſo highly aduanced theſe hundred yeeres, as by the King at that time: yet notwithſtanding before his departure they began to practiſe with his enimies. True it is that they ſerued him in fauour onely of the Duke of Milan, bicauſe they haue euer been of the faction Gibilin, but they ought not in reſpect thereof, to haue dealt faithleſly with him, who ſo highly had aduanced and pleaſured them, not only this way but diuers others.

All this did he at the Coulonnois requeſt, and yet before his returne to Aſt they ſhrunke from him, yea they were the very firſt that reuolted, though they could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage no cauſe that mooued them thereunto.</p>

But notwithſtanding all my ſolicitation, the King put foorth two matters to his councell which were ſoone debated: the one, whether he ſhould reſtore the Florentines places to them and accept the offers they made for the reſtitution of them, being theſe, to pay him the thirtie thouſand ducats remaining yet vnpaide of the ſumme they gaue him <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP2.NOTE7">

And if he had ſo done, he might haue paied his ſoldiers, and reſerued money ynough to haue withdrawen part of his enimies forces, and then haue fought with them. But this reſolution tooke no place; for Monſeur <hi>de Ligny</hi> a yoong man coſin german to the King ouerthrew it, not alleaging any reaſon to the contrarie, but onely for pitie of the Piſans. The other point debated was a matter that Monſeur <hi>de Ligny</hi> himſelfe cauſed to be propounded by <hi>Gaucher</hi> of Tinteuille, &amp; by one of the factions of the Senois, the which deſired the ſaid Monſeur <hi>de Ligny</hi> for their captain.

This fooliſh matter ſtaied the King there ſixe or ſeauen daies, during the which ſpace he ſolaced himſelfe with the Dames. Further, he left there three hundred of his men diminiſhing his force by ſo much, and then remooued to Piſa paſſing by Poggibonzia a caſtle of the Florentines.

                  </ref>, a man of holie life (as all men reported) abiding in a reformed couent where he had remained fifteen yeeres. The cauſe why I went to commune with him was, for that he had euer preached very fauorablie on the Kings behalfe, ſo far foorth that his words had ſtaide the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines from reuolting from vs, for neuer preacher caried ſo great credit in any citie: he had euer aſſured them of the Kings comming, whatſoeuer was ſaid or written to the contrarie; affirming that he was ſent of God to chaſtice the tyrants of Italie, and that no force ſhould be able to withſtand him. He preached further that the King ſhould come to Piſa and enter into the towne, and that the ſelfe ſame daie the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:7649:169"/>
eſtate of Florence ſhould be altered as alſo it happened: for the ſame daie was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of Medicis baniſhed the towne. Diuers other things alſo foretold he long before they happened, namely, the death of <hi>Laurence</hi> of Medicis: all the which he ſaide he vnderſtood by reuelation. He preached yet further that the eſtate of the church ſhould be reformed by the ſword. This is not yet come to paſſe, but was very neer, and he auoweth ſtill that it ſhall be. Many found great fault with him bicauſe he ſaide that God reuealed theſe things to him, but ſome beleeued him: ſure I for my part take him for a holie man. I asked him whether the K. ſhould paſſe out of Italie without danger of his perſon, ſeeing the great preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Venetia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s made againſt him, whereof he diſcourſed perfectlier than my ſelfe that came from thence. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me that the K. ſhould haue ſom troble vpon the way, but that the honor ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould be his, though he were accompanied but with an hundred men, and that God who had guided him at his comming, would alſo protect him at his returne. Adding notwithſtanding that bicauſe he had not done his dutie in the reformation of the Church, but had ſuffered his men to ſpoile and rob the people, as well thoſe that tooke his part, voluntarily receiued him into their cities, as his enimies: God had pronounced ſentence againſt him, and would ſhortly ſcourge him. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he bad me tell him that if he would haue compaſſion one the poore people, and endeuour himſelfe to keepe his men from doing euill, and puniſh the offenders (as he was bound by his office to do,) that then God would reuoke his ſentence, at the leaſt mittigate it: adding thereunto that he ought not to thinke it a ſufficient excuſe, that he in his owne perſon did no harme. He ſaid moreouer that himſelfe would go and tel the King thus much, and ſo indeed he did, and perſwaded with him to reſtore the Florentines places to them. When he ſpake thus of Gods ſentence, the death of my Lord the Daulphin came ſuddenly to my minde, for I ſaw no other thing that could greatly trouble the King. Thus much I haue written to the end it may yet more manifeſtly appeere, that this voiage was in deed a meere miracle of God.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the King was entred into Piſa, (as you haue heard) all the Piſans both men and women beſought their gueſts for Gods loue to make interceſſion to the King, that they might no more returne vnder the Florentines tyrannie, who in truth handled them extremely; but diuers cities in Italy that be in ſubiection to others, are as euill intreated as they: beſides that, the Piſans and Florentines had been in wars togither the ſpace of three hundred yeeres before the Florentines ſubdued them. Theſe lamentable words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned ioined with teares mooued our men to pitie, and cauſed them ſo far foorth to forget the Kings promiſe and oth made vpon the aultar of Saint Iohn at Florence, that all ſorts of men buſied themſelues in this matter, euen the poore archers and the Swiſſers, who alſo threatned thoſe that they thought perſwaded the King to performe his promiſe, namely the Cardinall Saint <hi>Malo,</hi> ſo often before named generall of Languedoc, whom I my ſelfe heard an archer threaten. There were in like maner that gaue very rough language to the Marſhall of Gié. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident <hi>Gannay</hi> by the ſpace of three daies and more, durſt not lie in his lodging. But the Earle of Ligny aboue all the reſt fauored the Piſans cauſe, who came in troupes weeping and lamenting to the King, in ſuch ſort, that we all pitied them, and would willingly haue releeued them, if it had lien in vs ſo to do. One day after dinner, fortie or fiftic gentlemen of the Kings houſe aſſembled themſelues togither, and went with their partiſans into the Kings chamber, where he was playing at tables with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeur <hi>de Pienncs,</hi> accompanied onely with two groomes of his chamber. One of theſe gentlemen ſonne to Sallezard the elder, ſpake as mouth of the reſt to the King, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to be gratious Lord to the Piſans, and accuſing certaine of thoſe lately na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as traitors to him. But the King with ſo ſtout language commanded them to depart, that after, the like neuer hapned. The King ſpent ſixe or ſeuen daies needleſly in the towne of Piſa, and then changed the garriſon, and made captaine of the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delle one <hi>Entragues,</hi> a man of lewd conditions, ſeruant to the D. of Orleans, whom he thus preferred by Monſeur <hi>de Lignis</hi> ſute, and left with him in the ſaid Citadelle certaine footemen of the Duchie of Berrie. Further, the ſaid <hi>Entragues</hi> procured ſuch friendſhip (I ſuppoſe by his money) that he was alſo made captaine of Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancte, and of another place neere to it called Mortron <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP3.NOTE1">

                  </ref>, and in like maner of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brefacto, which is neere to Lugues. The caſtle of Serzane being very ſtrong, was put at the requeſt of the ſaid Earle of Ligny, into the hands of a baſtard of Rouſſi, and an other place called Serzanelle, into the hands of another, being both his owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. In theſe places the King left a great part of his forces: notwithſtanding that he ſhall neuer haue ſuch need of men, as he had at that time. Moreouer, he refuſed the Florentines aid and offers aboue mentioned, and draue them into vtter deſpaire. Yet was he aduertiſed before his departure from Sene, that the Duke of Orleans (whom he had left behind him in Aſt) <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP3.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> had taken the city of Nauarre in the Duchie
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7649:170"/>
of Milan, and therefore was well aſſured that the Venetians would declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues his enimies: for they ſent him word that if he inuaded the Duke of Milan, they would aide the Duke with their whole force, according to their league lately made, and their force was great and in a readines. Now you ſhall vnderſtand that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the concluſion of their league, the Duke of Milan thought to haue ſurpriſed Aſt, ſuppoſing to finde it vtterly vnmanned: but my letters had haſtened the forces that the Duke of Bourbon ſent thither, and the firſt that arriued were about fortie launces of the Marſhall of Gies companie, which had tarried behinde in Fraunce, and came thither in good time. Soone after them arriued alſo fiue hundred footmen, ſent thither by the Marques of Saluce. The comming of the which ſtaied the Duke of Milans forces led by Maſter <hi>Galeas</hi> of Saint Seuerin, who hearing theſe newes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to Nom, a caſtle of the Duchie of Milan, two miles from Aſt. In the necke of theſe arriued alſo three hundred and fiftie men of armes, and certaine gentlemen of Daulphine, and two thouſand Swiſſers, with certain franke archers of the ſaid coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Daulphine, ſo that their whole number was 7500. men taking paie. But they lingred ſo long vpon the way that they ſerued not to the purpoſe they were ſent for. For the K. ſent for them to come &amp; ſuccor him, but inſtead of aiding him he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to aid them. The K. had alſo giuen commandement to the D. of Orleans &amp; his captaines not to attempte any thing againſt the Duke of Milan, but onely to defend the towne of Aſt, &amp; to meete him at the riuer of Theſin to helpe to conuey him ouer it, for that was the onely riuer to trouble him. But notwithſtanding all that the King writ to the Duke of Orleans, this enterpriſe of Nouarre (which is but ten leagues from Milan) liked him ſo wel, that he was contented to giue eare thereunto, and was receiued into the citie in great triumph both of the Guelphes and Gibelines, which his exploit the Marchioneſſe of Monferrat greatly furthered. The caſtle held two or three daies and then yeelded alſo. But if in the meane time, the Duke had gone or ſent to Milan (where he had good intelligence) he had been receiued into the towne with greater ioy, than euer he was into his caſtle of Blois, as diuers of the nobleſt men of the countrey haue enformed me. And the three firſt daies he might haue gone thither in ſafetie, for when Nouarre was taken, the Duke of Milans whole force lay yet at Nom neere to Aſt, and returned not to Milan till the fourth day after. But I ſuppoſe the Duke beleeued not all the intelligence he receiued thence.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard already of the Kings departure from Sene to Piſa, and of al that he did at Piſa. Thence he remoued to Luques where the citizens honorably receiued him, and there he abode two daies. Afterward he marched to Petroſancte (which <hi>Entra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> held) making no account of his enimies, neither himſelfe nor thoſe that carried all the credit with him. He paſſed maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtraights in the mountaines betweene Luques and Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancte, which a handfull of footemen might eaſily haue defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt him: but our enimies were not yet aſſembled. Neere to the ſaid Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancte is the ſtraight of Seire on the one ſide, and the ſtraight of Roctaille on the other, being great deepe ſalt marſhes, where we were forced to paſſe ouer a narrow way, like to a cauſey in a ſtanding poole: and this was the ſtraight that betweene Piſa and Pontreme I moſt feared, and which was reported to be moſt dangerous: for one cart ſet ouerthwart the way with two good peeces of artillerie, and but a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of men, might haue ſtopped our paſſage, had our force beene neuer ſo great. From Petroſancte the King remooued to Serzane, where the Cardinall Saint <hi>Peter ad vincula</hi> offered to make Genua reuolt, and deſired to haue ſome part of the Kings forces ſent thither. The matter was debated by the Kings Councell, my ſelfe being preſent at it in the companie of a great many wiſe men and good captaines: all the which concluded, that no eare ſhould be giuen to this enterpriſe, bicauſe if the King obtained the victorie, Genua would yeeld of it ſelfe; and if he were ouerthrowen, it could do him no ſeruice: and this was the firſt time that I perceiued any of them to doubt the battell. Report was made to the King of our reſolution; yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thither he ſent the Lord of Breſſe afterward Duke of Sauoy, the Lord of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, the Lord of Polignac my brother in lawe, and the Lord of Ambeiou of the houſe of Amboiſe, with ſixe ſcore men of armes, and fiue hundred croſſebowe men newly come out of Fraunce by ſea. But I woondred that ſo yoong a Prince had no truſtie ſeruants about him, that durſt boldly tell him into how great danger he put himſelfe by diminiſhing his force after this ſort: for as touching me, me thought he beleeued not all that I ſaid.</p>
               <p>We had a ſmall armie vpon the ſea returning from Naples, vnder the leading of the Lord of Myolens gouernor of Daulphin, and one <hi>Stephan de Neues</hi> of Montpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier. They were in all about eight gallies, and ſailed to Specie and Repalo, where at this preſent they were all defeated and led priſoners to Genua, in the ſelfeſame place where we had vanquiſhed King <hi>Alphonſes</hi> forces at the beginning of this voiage, and by the ſelfeſame men that tooke part with vs at that battell, namely Maſter <hi>Iohn Lewis</hi> de Fliſco, and Maſter <hi>Iohn Adorne:</hi> but if the matter had been well ordred, they ſhould haue been with the King, and all little ynough. The Lord of Breſſe and the Cardinall aboue mentioned went and lodged in the ſuburbes of Genua, thinking that their faction within the towne would haue riſen in their fauor. But the Duke of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:7649:171"/>
Milan and the <hi>Adornes</hi> that gouerned the towne, and Maſter <hi>Iohn Lewis</hi> de Fliſco (a wiſe knight) had giuen ſo good order to preuent this miſchiefe, that our men were in great danger to be defeated heere alſo, as the others were before vpon the ſea: for their number was ſmall, and had it not been bicauſe the faction that ruled at Genua durſt not iſſue foorth of the towne, for feare leaſt the Fourgouſes ſhould rebell and ſhut the gates vpon them, vndoubtedly they had all been ſlaine; for this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were in great diſtreſſe vpon the way as they retired to Aſt: beſides that, they were not at the battel with the King, where their ſeruice might haue ſtood him in good ſtead. From Serzane the King marched to Pontreme, through the which he was forced to paſſe, bicauſe it is the very entrie into the mountaines. The towne and caſtell were well fortified, and the ſeate of them maruellous ſtrong, but within them were not paſt three or fower hundred footemen; for if they had beene well manned, they had beene impregnable. Wherefore Frier <hi>Ieroms</hi> propheſie proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued true, which was, that God would leade the King by the hand, till he were out of danger: for it ſeemed that his enimies were blinded and bereft of their wits, in that they defended not this ſtraight. To the ſaid place of Pontreme the King ſent his vaward led by the Marſhall Gie, accompanied with Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> of Treuoul, whom the King had receiued into his ſeruice at Naples after King <hi>Ferrandes</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thence, with whom he was them in pay: he was a gentleman of Milan of a good houſe, a good captaine, a very valiant man, and a great enimie to the Duke of Milan: for he was baniſhed by him when King <hi>Ferrande</hi> receiued him into his ſeruice. By the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> his meanes, the place yeelded immediately without bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, and the garriſon that was within it departed. But a great inconuenience happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there: for (as before is mentioned) when the Duke of Milan paſſed laſt that way, they of the towne and certaine of our Swiſſers fell at variance (of whom about forty at that time were ſlaine) for reuenge whereof, the ſaid Swiſſers at this preſent (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the compoſition) ſlue all the men they found in the towne, ſpoiled it and burnt both victuals and all that was within it, and aboue ten alſo of themſelues being drunke, neither could the Marſhall Gie by any meanes make them to retire. They beſieged the caſtel alſo, meaning to haue done the like to thoſe that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, being the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> of Treuoules ſeruants, whom he had put into it when the garriſon of the enimies yeelded it, neither would the ſaid Almaines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thence till the King himſelfe ſent to them. It was great pitie that the towne was thus deſtroied, both bicauſe of the diſhonor we receiued thereby, and alſo bicauſe there was great plentie of victuals within it, whereof we were already in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP4.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>, notwithſtanding that the people were no where againſt vs, ſaue onely the people of the countrie neere to Pontreme, bicauſe of the harmes we did there. Now to proceede, if the King would haue followed the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> his aduiſe, diuers places of the Duchie of Milan would haue yeelded, and diuers gentlemen of the countrie haue reuolted to him: for he gaue him counſell to reare vp in euery place the yoong Dukes armes, whom the Lord <hi>Lodouic</hi> held in his hands, being ſonne to <hi>Iohn Galeas</hi> the Duke that laſt died at Pauia, as before you haue heard. But the King refuſed ſo to do, for the fauor he bare to the Duke of Orleans, who pretended and doth yet pretend title to the ſaid Duchie. Thus marched the King beyond Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, and lodged in a little valley neere to a village that had not ten houſes in it; the name whereof I know not. There he abode fiue daies vpon no occaſion, his armie being almoſt famiſhed, and his battell lying thirty miles behinde his vaward in the middeſt of huge and ſharpe mountaines, ouer the which ſuch great cannons and culuerins paſſed then, as neuer had paſſed before. For Duke <hi>Galeas</hi> in his time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7649:171"/>
ouer but fower faulcons, waying not paſt fiue hundred pound a peece, which was a great woonder in thoſe daies.</p>
               <p>I muſt now returne to the Duke of Orleans, who after he had taken the caſtell of Nouarre, ſtaid there a few daies to no purpoſe, and then went to Vigeſue, neere to the which were two little townes that ſent vnto him, offering to receiue him, but by wiſe aduiſe he refuſed their offer. They of Pauia ſent alſo twiſe to him to the ſame end, and them he ſhould not haue refuſed. Moreouer, he marched in order of battell before the ſaid towne of Vigeſne, where the Duke of Milans whole force lay, being led by the two brethren of Saint Seuerin, ſo often aboue named. The town is hardly ſo good as Saint Martin-de-Candé, which is not woorth ſixe pence. I my ſelfe arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued there not long after, at which time the Duke of Milan being there with certaine of his captaines, ſhewed me the place where both the armies had ſtood in order of battell hard by the towne and within the towne. And if the Duke of Orleans had marched but an hundred paces further, they had retired beyond the riuer of Theſin, for they ſtood hard by the riuer ſide, and had built a great bridge of boates ouer it. Moreouer, I ſaw them at my being there, beat downe a great bulwark of earth which they had made on the other ſide of the riuer to defend the paſſage; whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered that they were fully minded if the Duke had marched forward, to abandon both the towne and caſtle, which had been much to their diſaduantage. This is the place where the Duke of Milan vſeth moſt to be reſident, and ſure it is ſcituate in the pleaſanteſt countrey for all kinde of paſtimes, eſpecially hauking and hunting, that euer I ſawe. But peraduenture the Duke of Orleans thought the place ſtrong where his enimies lodged, and himſelfe to haue paſſed far ynough: wherefore he retired to Trecas, the Lord whereof (who had charge vnder the Duke of Milan) and my ſelfe communed togither of theſe affaires a fewe daies after. To the ſaid towne of Trecas certaine of the principal of Milan ſent to the Duke of Orleans, promiſing to receiue him into the towne, and offering for performance thereof, to deliuer their children in hoſtage. Which their enterpriſe they might eaſily haue executed, as diuers of great authority being then within the towne and acquainted with all their practiſes haue aduertiſed me: ſaying that the Duke of Milan could not haue found men ynow to haue defended the caſtell of Milan for him, bicauſe both nobles &amp; people deſired the deſtruction of this houſe of Sforce. The Duke of Orleans alſo and his men haue enformed me of theſe practiſes aboue mentioned, but they had no great affiance in thoſe that negotiated with them, and they lacked a man that vnderſtood theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires better than themſelues: whereunto I alſo adde, that the ſaid Dukes captaines were not all of one opinion as touching this enterpriſe. With the Duke of Milans forces ioined two thouſand Almains, whom the King of Romanes ſent thither, and a thouſand Dutch horſemen vnder the leading of maſter <hi>Frederic Capelare,</hi> borne in the countie of Ferrette. Their arriuall ſo much encouraged Maſter <hi>Galeas</hi> and his companie, that they went before Trecas to preſent the battell to the Duke of Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who refuſed it (notwithſtanding that his force were greater then theirs,) bicauſe his captaines as I ſuppoſe would not hazard the battell, fearing leaſt the loſſe therof ſhould be the Kings deſtruction, of whom they could heare no newes, bicauſe the paſſages were all ſtopped: wherefore they retired to Nouarre, giuing no order for their prouiſion of victuals, no not for the preſeruation of the ſtore they had within the towne already, much leſſe for any new ſupplie, whereof notwithſtanding they might plentifully haue been furniſhed at that time in the countrey about without money, whereas afterward they were greatly diſtreſſed through their owne follie. To conclude, their enimies came and lodged within halfe a league of them.</p>

               <head>How the Kings great artillerie paſſed the mounts Appenines by the Almains helpe, of the danger the Marſhall of Gie was in with his vaward, and how the King arriued at Fornoue. Chap. 5.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard how the King vpon no occaſion laie in a valley on this ſide Pontreme fiue daies togither, in great diſtreſſe of victuals. Our Almains did there one great peece of ſeruice: for thoſe that committed this foule fault at Pontreme, fearing that they had thereby procured themſelues the Kings indignation for euer; came and offered to paſſe the artillerie ouer theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous waies in the mountaines, for ſo may I well terme them, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſo high and ſteepe that there lay no beaten way ouer them. I haue ſeene all the higheſt mountaines both of Italy and Spaine, which vndoubtedly are not comparable to theſe. The Almains made this offer vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the K would pardon their fault, which he promiſed to do. We had fower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene great and maſſy peeces of artillery, and immediately after we were out of the valley, we mounted vp ſuch a maruellous ſteepe and vpright hill, that our mules could hardly clime vp to it. But theſe Almaines coupled themſelues two and two togither with ſtronge cordes, and drew a hundred or two at a time, and when one companie was wearied, a freſh ſucceeded. Beſides this, all the horſes appointed for conueiance of the artillery helped them, and euery man of the Kings houſe that had any train, lent a horſe to conueigh it ouer with the more ſpeed: but had it not been for the Almaines, the horſes would neuer haue paſſed it ouer. To ſay the truth they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed ouer not the artillerie onely, but the whole army, for had it not been for them there could not a man haue paſſed. But it is no maruell if they drew with good courages, bicauſe thereby they paſſed as well themſelues as vs, whereof they were no leſſe deſirous than we. They did much harme I confeſſe, but their good ſeruice far ſurmounted their euill deeds. The greateſt difficultie was not to draw vp the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, for when they were at the top of the mountaine, they might behold a great deepe valley vnderneath, for the way is ſuch as nature hath made, and by Arte it was neuer holpen. Wherefore vndoubtedly the difficultie was much greater in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighing the artillerie downe than in drawing it vp; for both horſes and men were forced to draw countermount at the taile of euery peece: beſides that, carpenters or ſmiths were continually working vpon them, for when a peece fell, great trouble it was to hoiſe it vp againe. Many gaue aduiſe to breake all the great artillerie, but the King would in no wiſe agree thereunto.</p>
               <p>The Marſhal of Gie who lay with our vaward thirtie miles before vs, preſſed the King to make haſte: but it was three daies before we could ioine with him. The eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies campe lay directly in his face within halfe a league of him, who in mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould haue had a good bootie if they had aſſailed him. Afterward he lodged in the village of Fornoue to keepe them from aſſailing vs in the mountaines, for the which purpoſe the village ſerued well, bicauſe it is at the foote of the mountains, and the very entry into the plaine. Notwithſtanding we had a better protector than him,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7649:172"/>
I meane God, who put an other conceit into our enimies heads: for ſo great was their couetouſnes that they reſolued to tarie vs in the plaine, to the end none of vs ſhould eſcape, ſuppoſing if they had aſſailed vs in the mountaines, that we would retire to Piſa and the Florentines places that we held. But therein they were much deceiued, for we were too far from thoſe places; beſides that, if our force and theirs had ioyned and fought, they might haue purſued as faſt as we could haue fled, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially knowing the countrie better then we did: hither to in all this voiage we had no war <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP5.NOTE1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>, but now it began. For the Marſhall of Gie aduertiſed the King that he was paſt the mountaines, and had ſent fortie light horſe to giue an alarme to the enimies campe thereby to diſcouer their actions, who were incontinent encounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Eſtradiots <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP5.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>, the which ſlew a gentleman of ours named <hi>le Beuf,</hi> and cut off his head and hung it at one of their launces, and caried it to their prouiſors to receiue a ducat for it. Theſe Eſtradiots are ſoldiers like to the Turkes Ianizaries, and attired both on foote and horſebacke like to the Turks, ſaue that they weare not vpon their head ſuch a great roule of linnen as the Turkes do called Tolliban. They are rough ſoldiers, for both they and their horſes keepe the fields winter and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. They were all Greekes come from the places that the Venetians hold there, ſome from Naples <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP5.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> in the countrie of Morea, ſome out of Albain, and ſome from Duras. Their horſes are excellent good, for they are all Turkiſh. The Venetians vſe their ſeruice much and truſt them well. I ſaw them all when they landed at Venice, and muſtered in an Ile wherein the Abbey of Saint Nicholas ſtandeth: they were to the number of fifteen hundred, and are valiant men, and trouble an army exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their alarmes when they are ſo diſpoſed to do. Theſe Eſtradiots followed the chaſe euen to the Marſhals lodging, and entered into our Almaines campe, of whom they ſlew three or fower, and caried their heads away with them, for ſuch is their maner. Bicauſe when the Venetians were in war with the Turke <hi>Mahomet Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoman</hi> this Turkes father that now raigneth: he commanded his men to take no priſoners, but gaue them a ducat for euery head, and the Venetians did the like, which maner I thinke they now vſed, the more to terrifie vs, as indeed they did. But the ſaid Eſtradiots were no leſſe daunted themſelues with our artillerie: for one faulken ſhot ſlew one of their horſes, whereupon they retired incontinent, for they vnderſtood not the feat of artillerie: but in their retract, they tooke a Captaine of our Almaines priſoner, who was mounted on horſebacke to ſee if they retired. He was ſtricken through the body with a launce, for he was vnarmed. He was a wiſe fellow, and they led him to the Marques of Mantua Generall of the Venetians ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, being then accompanied with his vncle the Lord <hi>Rodolphe</hi> of Mantua, and the Earle of Caiazze Captaine of the Duke of Milans forces, who knew this Captaine that was taken very well. Now you ſhall vnderſtand that our enimies whole force was abrode in order of battell <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP5.NOTE4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref>, at the leaſt all that was aſſembled: for all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were not yet come togither, notwithſtanding that they had lien there eight daies making their muſters, ſo that the King had leaſure ynough to haue returned into Fraunce without all danger, had it not been for the long abode he made to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the places aboue rehearſed. But God had otherwiſe diſpoſed of this buſines.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Marſhall fearing to be aſſailed, encamped vpon the mountaine, hauing with him onely eight ſcore men of armes and eight hundred Almaines as he told me himſelfe: and as touching vs we could not haue ſuccoured him, for it was a daie and a halfe after before we could ioine with him bicauſe of our artillerie <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP5.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref>. The King lodged by the way at two yoong Marqueſſes houſes. Our vaward laie vpon the hill in great feare waiting howerly when their enimies (who ſtood in order of battell,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7649:173"/>
a pretie way from them in the plaine) would aſſaile them. But God who alwaies manifeſtly declared that he would preſerue the company, tooke away our enimies ſenſes from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Earle of Caiazze asked our Almaine who it was that led this vaward, and how great the force was, for he knew our number as well as our ſelues, bicauſe he had been with vs all the ſommer. The Almaine made the force great, and reported them to be three hundred men of armes, and fifteen hundred Swiſſers: whereunto the Earle anſwered that he lied, alleaging that in the whole armie were but three thouſand Swiſſers, and that it was vnlike we would ſend the halfe before with the vaward. Then this Almaine was ſent priſoner to the Marques of Mantuas pauilion, and they conſulted whether they ſhould aſſaile the Marſhall or no. But the Marques crediting the Almaines report, alleaged that their foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not able to match our Almaines, and that part of their force was yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, without the which they ſhould do wrong to fight. And further, that if they ſhould happen to be diſcomfited, the ſeniorie might iuſtly be diſpleaſed: wherefore he liked better to tarie vs in the plaine, ſeeing we could paſſe no way but iuſt before them: of which opinion were alſo the two prouiſors, againſt whoſe aduiſe they durſt not fight: but others ſaid that if this vaward were defeated, the King muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie be taken: notwithſtanding in the end they agreed all to tarie vs in the plaine, truſting that not one of vs ſhould eſcape. All this I vnderſtood by the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues aboue named: for after the battell we and they met togither, and the Marſhal of Gie and my ſelfe had great communication with them about theſe affaires. Thus they retired into their campe, being well aſſured that within a daie or two the King would paſſe the mountaines and lodge in the village of Fornoue. In the meane time al the reſt of their forces arriued, and we could not paſſe but hard before them: ſo ſtraight and narrow was the way. When we came downe the mountaines we beheld the champaigne countrey of Lombardy, which is the pleaſanteſt, beſt, and fruitfulleſt ſoile in the world. But notwithſtanding I call it champaigne; yet is it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie troubleſome for horſemen, bicauſe it is full of ditches like to Flaunders, yea ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler I thinke: but withall it is much pleaſanter and plentifuller both of good corne, good wines, and fruits, for their grounds beare euery yeere. We were right glad to behold it, bicauſe of the great famine and penurie we had ſuſtained in our iourney euer ſince our departure from Luques. But our artillerie tired vs exceedingly as we came downe the hill, ſo ſteepe and painfull was the way. Our enimies campe was well furniſhed of tents and pauilions, which made it ſhew maruellous great, and ſure ſo was it: for the Venetians had performed their promiſe made to the King by me, which was that they and the Duke of Milan would put fortie thouſand men into the field, at the leaſt if they performed it not fullie, they failed not much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for in this army were fiue and thirtie thouſand taking pay, fower parts of fiue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Saint Marke <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP5.NOTE6">

               <p>The King came downe the mountaine about noone, and lodged in the village of Fornoue, vpon ſunday being the fift of Iuly, the yeere 1495.

eaſed the armie: but their bread was little and blacke, and they ſold it deere, and three parts of their wine was water. I my ſelfe cauſed ſome of their victuals to be bought for me, which notwithſtanding I durſt not taſte of, bicauſe we ſuſpected they meant to poiſon vs, ſo that at the firſt no man durſt aduenture to eate of them; and the ſuſpition increaſed, bicauſe two Swiſſers were found dead in a ſeller, hauing drunke themſelues to death, or taken cold after they had drunke. But before mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night the horſes began firſt to feede, and afterward the men, and then we refreſhed our ſelues well. I muſt heere ſpeake ſomwhat in the honor of the Italian nation, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we neuer found in all this voiage that they ſought by poiſon to do vs harme, yet if they would we could hardly haue auoided it. We arriued at Fornoue (as you haue heard) vpon ſunday at noone: the King lighted &amp; ate and dranke, a little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelfe, but a number of gentlemen there were that hardly could get a morſell of bread, for there was ſmall ſtore of other victuals than ſuch as we found in the place, whereof till midnight (as before you haue heard) none of vs durſt taſte.</p>
               <p>Immediately after dinner, certaine of their Eſtradiots came and gaue vs a hot alarme euen within our camp. Our men were as yet vnacquainted with them, for the which cauſe all our armie came foorth into the field in very good order, and in three battels, vaward, battell, and rereward, the one being not aboue a bowles caſt from the other, ſo that ech of them might with ſpeed haue ſuccoured other: but in the end this hot alarme prooued nothing, wherefore we returned to our lodging. We had a few tents and pauilions, and our campe lay in length auauncing it ſelf towards theirs: beſides that, there was a wood through the which the enimies might come vnder couert almoſt to vs <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP5.NOTE8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref>, by meanes whereof twentie of their Eſtradiots might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily giue vs an alarme at all times, and ſo I warrant you they did, for they lay continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the end of our campe. We encamped in a valley, betweene two little hils <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP5.NOTE9">
                     <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                  </ref>, through the which ran a riuer, that a man may eaſily paſſe ouer on foote, vnleſſe it happen to ariſe, as it doth often vpon the ſudden in that countrey, but the waters tarrie not long, the riuers name is Tarro. Al the ſaid valley is grauell and great ſtone, very troubleſome for horſemen, and not aboue a quarter of a league broade. Vpon the hill on the right hand lay our enimies (hardly halfe a league from vs) ſo that we were forced to paſſe iuſt before them, the riuer running betweene vs: for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that on the backe ſide of the hill on the left hand (vnderneath the which we encamped) there lay another way that we might haue taken; yet would we not ſo do, leaſt we ſhould ſeeme to flie, but encamped in the valley at the foote of the ſaid hill, in the face of our enimies. Thoſe in our campe that were of the wiſer ſort began now to feare, in ſuch ſort, that about two daies before, they had deſired me to go and parle with the enimies, taking one with me to view them, and to number how great their force was. I was loth to take this iourny vpon me, bicauſe without ſafe conduct I could not go in ſafetie. Wherefore I anſwered that both at my departure from Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, and the ſame night alſo that I arriued at Padua, I was entred into good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with their prouiſors, ſo that I thought they would not refuſe to commune with me in the midway betweene both the armies: but if I ſhould offer my ſelfe to go to them I ſhould thereby too much encourage them; adding further, that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was mooued too late. Notwithſtanding, the ſelfe ſame ſunday that the King arriued at Fornoue, I writ to their prouiſors (one of the which was named Maſter <hi>Luques Piſan,</hi> and the other Maſter <hi>Melchior Treuiſan)</hi> deſiring them that vnder ſafe conduct, one of them would come and parle with me, according to their offer made at our departure from Padua, (as before you haue heard.) They anſwered that they would willingly haue ſatisfied my requeſt, if the war had not been begun vpon the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7649:174"/>
Duke of Milan: notwithſtanding, they promiſed that one of them (whether of the twaine ſhould be appointed) would come into ſome place in the midway to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with me if we ſo thought good; which anſwer I receiued the ſame ſunday at night: but thoſe that had all the credit with the King, made no account thereof. As touching my ſelfe, I durſt not take too much vpon me, nor preſſe the matter too ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, leaſt they ſhould charge me with cowardiſe: wherefore I waded no further in it that night; notwithſtanding, that I would with all my hart haue helped the King and his army out of that ſtraight, if I might haue done it without danger.</p>
               <p>About midnight the Cardinall of Saint Malo, whoſe pauilion was hard by mine, told me as he came from the King, that we ſhould depart the next morning by break of day, &amp; that the King would command a cannon to be ſhot into the enimies camp as we paſſed along by them, to ſignifie that he was there ready to preſent them bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and ſo march forward without any more adoe. And I ſuppoſe that this aduiſe proceeded from the Cardinall himſelfe, as a man vnable to talke of the wars, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnderſtanding what they meant. But it had been requiſite that the King ſhould haue aſſembled the wiſeſt men and beſt captaines in his armie, to debate ſo weighty a matter as this was. And yet perhaps that ſhould haue beene but to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe neither; for I ſawe many matters debated in this voiage, the which were execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cleane contrary to the reſolution. I anſwered the Cardinal that if we approched ſo neere them, as to ſhoote into their campe, vndoubtedly men would iſſue foorth on both ſides to the skirmiſh, the which could neuer be retired without battell: alleaging further, that this was cleane contrarie to that I had already begun with their prouiſors, and it greeued me, that we ſhould take this courſe: but ſuch had mine eſtate been euer ſince the beginning of the Kings raigne, that I durſt not wade too far in any matter, leaſt I ſhould haue procured my ſelfe the diſpleaſure of them that were in authoritie about him, which was ſo great where he liked, that it was but too great.</p>
               <p>The ſelfeſame night we had two other great alarmes all through our owne fault, bicauſe we had giuen no order againſt their Eſtradiots as we ought to haue done, and the vſe is to do in the wars againſt light horſemen: for twenty of our men of armes with their archers would haue matched two hundred of them; but they were as yet ſtrange to vs. There fell alſo this night a terrible raine, and ſuch lightening &amp; thundering as was neuer ſince the world began; ſo that heauen and earth ſeemed to go togither, or that this foreſhewed ſome great inconuenience to enſue. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that we knew well, that the reuerberation of theſe great mountaines (at the foote of the which we lay) made this thunder ſeeme greater than indeede it was; and further, that thunder and lightening be naturall in a hot countrie, eſpecially in ſommer: yet ſeemed they at that preſent the more dreadfull and terrible to vs, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſawe ſo many enimies encamped before vs, we hauing none other meanes to paſſe through them but by battell, our force being ſo ſmall as it was; for we were not aboue nine thouſand able men good and bad: of the which two thouſand were noble mens ſeruants of the campe; but I comprehend not in this number pages nor ſtraglers, nor ſuch kinde or people.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He monday morning about ſeuen of the clocke, being the ſixt day of Iuly, the yeere of our Lord 1495. the noble King mounted on horſebacke calling often for me. At my comming to him I found him armed at all peeces, and mounted vpon the braueſt horſe that euer I ſaw, called Sauoy, which ſome ſaid was a horſe of Breſſe. Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of Sauoy gaue him to the King: he was blacke, and had but one eie, and of a meane ſtature, but tall ynough for him he carried. This yoong Prince ſeemed that day altogither another man than either his nature, perſon, or complexion would beare: for naturally he was, and yet is very fearfull in ſpeech, bicauſe he had euer been brought vp in great awe, and with men of meane eſtate: but this horſe made him ſeeme great, and he had a good countenance and a good colour, and his talke was ſtout and wiſe: whereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered (as I then called to minde) that Frier <hi>Ierom</hi> told me truth, when he ſaid that God would leade him by the hand, and that he ſhould haue ſomewhat to do vpon the way, but that the honor thereof ſhould be his. His words to me were theſe; if theſe men will parlament, go and commune with them, and bicauſe the Cardinall was there preſent, he named him to accompanie me, and the Marſhall of Gie, who was out of patience bicauſe of a broile that had happened betweene the Earles <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP6.NOTE1">

                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>, as all men ſaid. I anſwered the King, that I would do his commandement, but that I neuer ſaw two ſo great forces ſo neere togither, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part without battell.</p>
               <p>Our whole armie marched foorth vpon the plaine in good order, the one battell neere to the other as the day before: but as touching the force, it ſeemed but a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to that I had ſeene with Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of Burgundie, and King <hi>Lewis</hi> this Kings father. Vpon the ſaid plaine the Cardinall and I withdrew our ſelues aſide, and endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a letter to the two Prouiſors aboue named, the which was written by one Maſter <hi>Robertet</hi> a Secretarie of the Kings, and in good credit. The contents of our letter were, that it appertained to the eſtate and office of the Cardinall to procure peace, and vnto me alſo hauing ſo lately been ambaſſador at Venice; for the which cauſe I
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7649:175"/>
might as yet take vpon me the office of mediator betweene the King and them. We ſignified further to them on the Kings behalfe, that he would but paſſe foorth his way without doing harme to any man: wherefore if they minded to parlament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order taken the day before, we for our parts were willing thereunto, and would imploy our ſelues to do all the good we could. The skirmiſhes were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun round about vs, and after our armie had marched awhile, ſoftly paſſing along before them, the riuer running betweene them and vs (as you haue heard) we approched ſo neer to them, that we came within a quarter of a league of their camp, within the which they ſtood all in martiall aray: for their maner is to make their campe ſo large, that they may all ſtand in order of battell within it.</p>
               <p>They ſent foorth incontinent part of their Eſtradiots and croſſebowe men on horſebacke, and certaine men of armes, the which came along vpon the way almoſt vnder couert, towards the village of Fornoue (out of the which we were departed) meaning there to paſſe this little riuer, and to aſſaile our carriage, which was ſo great, that I thinke it laded aboue 6000. mules, horſes, and aſſes. They had ſet their battels in ſuch order many daies before they fought, that better they could not be ordered: for they were ſo placed, that their great number halfe aſſured them of the victory, bicauſe they aſſailed the K. &amp; his army on euery ſide, in ſuch ſort that not one of vs could haue eſcaped if we had been broken, conſidering the ſtraight we were in. Thoſe aboue mentioned came and aſſailed our carriage, and on the left hand came the Marqueſſe of Mantua, the Lord <hi>Rodolph</hi> his vncle, and the Earle <hi>Bernardin</hi> of Dalmouton, with all the flower of their armie, being to the number of ſixe hundred men of armes, as they themſelues afterward confeſſed, all the which entred into the plaine directly behinde vs. Their men of armes were all barded, and furniſhed with braue plumes and goodly bourdonaſſes <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP6.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>, and well accompanied with croſſebowe men on horſebacke, Eſtradiots, and footemen. Againſt the Marſhall of Gie and our vaward, marched the Earle of Caiazze with fower hundred men of armes (accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied as the others aboue mentioned) and with a great band of footemen: with him alſo was another companie of two hundred men of armes, led by Maſter <hi>Iohn</hi> de Bentiuoille of Bolonia his ſonne, a yoong man, who before had neuer ſeen the wars, for they were as ſlenderly prouided of good captaines as we. This yoong <hi>Bentiuoille</hi> was placed there, to giue a new charge vpon our vaward immediately after the Earle of Caiazze. With the Marqueſſe of Mantua was alſo a like companie of men of armes for the ſame purpoſe, vnder the leading of Maſter <hi>Anthony</hi> of Vrbin baſtard to the late Duke of Vrbin. Beſides theſe there remained yet in their campe two great troupes of men of armes, as I vnderſtood the next day by themſelues when they and I communed togither, and I ſaw them alſo with mine eies. And this they did bicauſe the Ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tians would not hazard all at once, nor vnfurniſh their campe. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanding in mine opinion it had beene better for them to haue aduentured their whole force, ſeeing they meant to fight.</p>
               <p>I will now tell you what became of the letter, the Cardinall and I ſent to their campe by a trumpeter. The Prouiſors receiued it, and immediately after they had read it, braſt foorth the firſt peece of our artillerie, then ſhot theirs which was not ſo good as ours. The ſaid Prouiſors incontinent ſent backe our trumpeter, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a trumpeter of the Marqueſſes, who brought word that they were content to parlament, if we would cauſe our artillerie to ceaſe, ſaying, that they on their ſide would do the like. I was then a great way from the King, who rid about heere and there, and ſent backe theſe two trumpeters with anſwere, that he would make the artillerie to ceaſe, and gaue commandement to the Maſter of the ordinance to ſtay
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7649:175"/>
the ſhot, and ſo all ceaſed awhile on both ſides. But ſoone after vpon a ſudden they diſcharged one of their peeces, and then ſhot ours againe freſhlier than before, and we approched three of our peeces neerer to them. After the two trumpeters were arriued at their campe, they tooke ours and ſent him to the Marqueſſes pauilion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing to fight. For the Earle of Caiazze (as thoſe that were preſent haue informed me) ſaid that it was now no time to parlament, ſeeing that we were halfe vanquiſhed already; and one of their Prouiſors was of his opinion, and agreed to fight (as I haue heard himſelfe report) but the other would not conſent thereunto. The Marqueſſe in like maner deſired the battell, but his vncle, who was a vertuous and a wiſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and loued vs well, and bare armes againſt vs with an euill will, withſtood it to the vttermoſt of his power; but in the end they agreed all to fight.</p>
               <p>Now you ſhal vnderſtand, that the King had put his whole force into his vaward, in the which were three hundred and fiftie men of armes, and three thouſand Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers (the onely hope of our army) with whom he commanded three hundred archers of his garde to ioine themſelues on foote, and likewiſe certaine croſſebowe men on horſebacke of the two hundreth that were alſo of his garde, which was a great dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of the ſafety of his perſon. In our army were but few footemen beſides theſe, for all that we had were placed in the vaward. On foote with our Almaines were the Lord <hi>Engelbert</hi> brother to the Duke of Cleues, Lornay, and the bailife of Digeon, the ſaid Almains captain, and before them marched our artillerie. Heere they whom we left in the Florentines places, and thoſe that were ſent to Genua would haue don good ſeruice, contrary to the opinion of all men. Our vaward had now marched al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as far as their campe, ſo that all men thought they ſhould haue begun the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: but our two other battels were not ſo neere it, nor ſo well placed to haue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured it as the day before. Further, bicauſe the Marques of Mantua (who was entred into the plaine and paſt the riuer) was directly vpon our backe, about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a league behinde our rereward, marching with his force ſoftly and cloſe togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was a maruellous pleaſant ſight to behold; the King was forced to turne his backe to his vawarde, and his face towards his enimies, and ſo to approch neerer to his rereward, and retire from his vaward. I was then with the Cardinall atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an anſwer of our letter, but I told him I perceiued it was no time to ſtaie any longer there; wherfore I departed being hard by the Swiſſers, and went to the King. But before I could come to him, I loſt a page who was my coſin germaine, and a groome of my chamber, and a lackey which followed a prety way behinde me, ſo that I ſaw not when they were ſlaine.</p>
               <p>I had not riden aboue a hundred paces, when ſuddenly a cry began to ariſe in the ſelfe ſame place from whence I was departed, or but little beyond. For you ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that their Eſtradiots at this very inſtant came to our carriage, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> entred into the Kings lodging where were three or fower houſes, in the which they ſlew or hurt fower or fiue ſoldiers, but the reſt eſcaped, they ſlew alſo about an hundred of our ſtraglers, and put our carriage in great diſorder. When I came to the King, I found him dubbing of knights, but bicauſe the enimies were at hand, we cauſed him to ceaſe, and then I hard the baſtard of Bourbon named <hi>Mathew</hi> (who was in good credit with the King) and one <hi>Philip de Moulin</hi> (a poore gentleman but very valiant) call the King, ſaying, paſſe foorth ſir, paſſe foorth: whereupon he went into the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of his battell, and placed himſelfe before his ſtandard, ſo that (the baſtard of Bourbon excepted) I ſawe none neerer the enimies then himſelfe. Our enimies mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched luſtely forward, in ſuch ſort that within leſſe than a quarter of an hower after my arriuall, they were come within a hundred paces of the King, who was as euill
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7649:176"/>
garded &amp; as euil waited on, as euer was Prince or noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but mauger the deuil, he is wel defended whom God defends. And ſure the propheſie of the reuerend father frier <hi>Hierom</hi> prooued true, who told me (as before you haue heard) that God led him by the hand. His rereward ſtood vpon his right hand, being recoiled ſomwhat from him; &amp; the neereſt companie to him on that ſide was the D. of Orleans companie, being to the number of 80. launces led by <hi>Robinet</hi> of Frainezelles, and Monſeur de la Trimoilles company, being about forty launces, and the hundred Scottiſh archers of his garde, who thruſt themſelues into the preſſe as men of armes. I my ſelfe ſtood vpon the left hand with the gentlemen, penſioners, and ſeruants of the Kings houſe. This rereward was led by the Earle of Foix: but as touching the names of the other captaines, I paſſe them ouer for breuitie.</p>
               <p>Within a quarter of an hower after my arriuall, the enimies being ſo neere the King, as you haue heard, charged their ſtaues, and began a ſoft gallop. They were diuided into two troupes; one of the which charged the two companies of our horſemen, and the Scottiſh archers ſtanding on the Kings right hand; and the other, the King himſelfe; ſo that both they and the King were charged almoſt at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: we that ſtood vpon the left hand charged them vpon the flanke greatly to our aduantage; and vndoubtedly it is impoſſible for men to meete roughlier than we met. But the Eſtradiots that accompanied them, ſeeing our mules and carriage flie towards our vaward, and their companions <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP6.NOTE4">

The Italian men of armes, immediately after they had broken their ſtaues fled, and their footemen or the greateſt part ſhrunke aſide, and fled alſo. At the ſelfeſame time that they charged vs, the Earle of Caiazze gaue a charge alſo vpon our vaward, but they met not ſo roughly as we: for at the very inſtant that they ſhould haue couched their ſtaues, they began to faint, and diſordered themſelues in ſuch ſort, that fifteene or twenty of them being ſcattered amongſt our bands, were taken and ſlaine by our Almaines; the reſt were but eaſily purſued: for the Marſhall of Gie endeuored to keepe his forces togither, bicauſe he ſaw yet a great troupe of enimies not far from him. Notwithſtanding part of his men followed the chaſe, and part of the Earle of Caiazzes men that fled, paſſed ouer the place where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques &amp; we had fought, with their ſwords in their hands; for they had throwne awaie their ſtaues. But they that aſſailed the King fled immediately after they had charged, and were maruellous ſwiftly purſued, for we all followed the chaſe: part of them tooke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

We had a great number of ſtraglers and ſeruants following vs, all the which flocked about the Italian men of armes being ouerthrowen, and ſlue the moſt of them. For the greateſt part of the ſaid ſtraglers had their hatchets in their hands, wherewith they vſed to cut wood to make our lodgings, with the which
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7649:176"/>
hatchets they brake the viſards of their head peeces, and then claue their heads, for otherwiſe they could hardly haue beene ſlaine, they were ſo ſurely armed; ſo that there were euer three or fower about one of them. Moreouer, the long ſwords that our archers and ſeruants had, did that day a great execution. The King tarried vpon the place where the charge was giuen, accompanied with ſeuen or eight yoong gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, whom he had appointed to attend vpon him, for neither would he follow the chaſe, neither retire to his vaward bicauſe it was ſomwhat farre off. He eſcaped wel at the firſt encounter, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that he was one of the foremoſt, for the baſtard of Bourbon was taken within leſſe then twenty paces of him <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP6.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref>, and led priſoner to the enimies campe.</p>
               <p>The King abode in the ſaid place maruellous weakely accompanied: for he had with him not a man more than one groome of his chamber called <hi>Anthonie des Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> a little fellow and euill armed: the reſt were ſcattered heere and there, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe told me at night euen in the preſence of thoſe that were appointed to waite vpon him, who deſerued great reproche for leauing their Prince in ſuch eſtate. Notwithſtanding they arriued in time, for a certaine ſmall broken troupe of Italian men of armes paſſing along vpon the plaine (where they ſaw no man ſtirring) came and aſſailed the King and this groome of his chamber: but the King being moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the braueſt horſe in the world for a man of his ſtature, remooued to and fro, and deſended himſelfe valiantly: and at that very inſtant certaine of the reſt of his men being not far from him arriued, whereupon the Italians fled, and then the King followed good aduiſe and retired to his vaward, which had neuer mooued out of their firſt place. Thus the King with his battell had good ſucceſſe: and if his vaward had marched but one hundred paces farther, our enimies whole armie had fled. Some ſaid they ought ſo to haue done, but others held opinion that they did beſt to ſtaie.</p>
               <p>Our company that followed the chaſe purſued the enimies hard to their campe, which lay in length almoſt as far as Fornoue, and not one of vs receiued a blow ſaue <hi>Iulien Bourgneuf,</hi> whom I ſaw fall dead to the ground with a ſtroke that an Italian gaue him as he paſſed by (for he was euill armed:) whereupon certaine of vs ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſayieng, let vs returne to the King, and with that word all the whole troupe ſtood ſtill to giue their horſes breath, which were very wearie bicauſe they had chaſed a great way, and all vpon ſharpe ſtones. Hard by vs fled a troupe of thirty men of armes, whom we let paſſe quietly fearing to aſſaile them. When we had brethed our horſes, we rid foorth a faſt trot towards the King, not knowing what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him, but after a while we deſcried him a far off. Then cauſed we our ſeruants to light on foote, and gather vp the launces wherewith the place lay ſtrawed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with Bourdonaſſes, which were not much woorth, for they were hollow and hardly ſo waightie as a iauelin, but trimly painted, and by this meanes we were better furniſhed of launces than in the morning. Thus as we rid towards the King, by the way we met a broken band of the enimies footemen croſſing ouer the fielde, being of thoſe that had lien hid among the hils, and had led the Marques of Mantua vpon the King backe: many of them were ſlaine, and the reſt eſcaped, and waded through the riuer, and we ſtaied not long about them. Diuers of our men cried often during the whole conflict, remember Guynegate, which was a battel loſt in Picardie in the time of K. <hi>Levvis</hi> the eleuenth, againſt the K. of Romanies <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP6.NOTE6">

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7649:177"/>
the beſt and beſt couered, namely al the Kings, and all his chamberlains. They tooke alſo a groome of the Kings chamber called <hi>Gabriell,</hi> who had about him the ancient iewels of the Kings of Fraunce, which he then caried with him, bicauſe the King was there in perſon. True it is that a number of coffers were alſo loſt, but they were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne and ſpoiled by our owne men, for we had in our campe a great many var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and harlots that ſtripped the dead bodies, and ſpoiled all that they could come by, but as touching the enimies they tooke onely thoſe aboue rehearſed. There were ſlaine on both ſides (as I haue been credibly enformed both by them and certaine of our owne men) to this number. We loſt <hi>Iulian Bourgneuf,</hi> the ſergeant porter of the Kings houſe, a gentleman of the Kings houſe, and nine Scottiſh archers, of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of our vaward to the number of twenty, and about our cariage three or fower ſcore horſe-keepers. And they loſt three hundred and fiftie men of armes, ſlaine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place: but not one of them was taken priſoner, which chance I thinke neuer hapned before in any battel. Of their Eſtradiots few were ſlaine, for they turned al to the ſpoile as you haue heard. There died of them in all three thouſand and fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, as diuers of the beſt of their army haue enformed me: others haue told me more, but ſure they loſt many gentlemen: for I ſawe my ſelfe a role wherein were the names of eighteene gentlemen of good houſes, and among them fower or fiue of the Marques owne name which was <hi>Gonzague,</hi> beſides the which, the Marques loſt alſo at the leaſt three ſcore gentlemen of his owne dominions, all the which were horſemen, and not one footeman among them. It is ſtrange that ſo many were ſlaine with hand ſtrokes; for as touching the artillerie, I thinke it ſlew not ten on both ſides. The fight endured not a quarter of an hower, for ſo ſoone as they had broken or throwne away their launces they fled all: the chaſe continued about three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an hower. Their battels in Italy are not fought after this ſort, for they fight ſquadron after ſquadron, ſo that a battell endureth there ſomtime a whole day, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party obteining victorie.</p>
               <p>The flight on their ſide was great, for three hundred of their men of armes and the greateſt part of their Eſtradiots fled, ſome to Rege <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP6.NOTE7">

In the morning the very ſame hower that the two armies ioined, the Earle of Petillane &amp; the Lord <hi>Virgile Vrſin</hi> eſcaped from vs. The ſaid <hi>Virgile</hi> went but to a gentlemans houſe thereby, where he remained vpon his word, but the Earle fled ſtraight to our enimies, and to ſay the truth, we did them both great wrong to leade them with vs after this ſort. The Earle being a man well knowne among the ſoldiers (for he had alwaies had charge both vnder the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines and vnder King <hi>Ferrand)</hi> began to crie Petillane Petillane, and ran after them that fled aboue three leagues, ſaying that al was theirs, and calling them to the ſpoile, by the which meanes he brought backe the greateſt part of them, and put them out of all feare, aſſuring them vpon his word that there was no danger, ſo that had it not been for him alone, their whole armie had fled: for the word of ſuch a man newly departed from vs was no ſmall ſtaie to them. The ſaid Earle (as himſelfe hath ſince told me) gaue aduiſe to aſſaile vs again the ſame night, but they would not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereunto. The Marques hath alſo ſince communed with me of theſe affaires chalenging this aduiſe as his: but to ſay the truth had it not been for the Earle alone they had all fled the ſame night.</p>
               <p>When we were come to the King, we diſcouered a great number of men of armes and footemen ſtanding yet in order of battell without their campe, whoſe heads and launces onely we could deſcrie. They had ſtood there all the day, and neuer mooued from that place, notwithſtanding they were further from vs than they ſeemed: for
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7649:177"/>
they and we could not haue ioined without paſſing the riuer, which was riſen and aroſe howerly, bicauſe all the day it had thundered, lightened, and rained terribly, eſpecially during the battell and the chaſe. The K. debated with his captaines whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhould aſſaile theſe new diſcouered enimies or not: with him were three Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian knights, one named Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> of Treuoul, who is yet liuing, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelfe that day like a woorthy gentleman; another Maſter <hi>Francis Secco</hi> a valiant knight, in pay with his Florentines, and of the age of 72. yeeres; and the third Maſter <hi>Camillo Vitelly,</hi> who with his three brethren was in ſeruice with the King, and came vnſent for from Ciuita de Caſtello, as far as Serzane (which is a great iourney) to be at this battell: but perceiuing that he could not ouertake the King with his companie, he came himſelfe alone. Theſe two latter gaue aduice to march againſt theſe enimies newly diſcouered: but the Frenchmen were of a contrarie opinion, ſaying, that they had done ynough, and that it was late, and time to make their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings. But the ſaid Maſter <hi>Francis Secco</hi> maintained ſtoutly his opinion, ſhewing people that paſſed to and fro vpon the high way that leadeth to Parma (the neereſt towne that the enimies could retire into) whom he affirmed to be enimies flying thither or returning thence, and indeede he ſaid true, as we vnderſtood afterward; and ſure both his words and countenance ſhewed him to be a hardy and a wiſe knight. For all their captaines confeſſed to me (yea ſome of them before the Duke of Milan himſelfe) that if we had marched forward, they had all fled; by meanes wherof we ſhould haue obtained the goodlieſt, honorableſt, and profitableſt victorie that happened in ten yeeres before: for if a man could haue vſed it well, haue made his profit of it, haue behaued himſelfe wiſely, and entreated the people gently; the Duke of Milan by the ſpace of eight daies after, ſhould not haue had any one place to hold for him in his countrie, except the caſtell of Milan, yea and I doubt of that too: ſo deſirous were his ſubiects to rebell. The like would alſo haue happened to the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, ſo that the King ſhould not haue needed to take care for Naples: for the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians ſhould not haue been able to leuie a man out of Venice, Breſſa, and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone, which is but a ſmall towne, bicauſe all the reſt that they held in Italie would haue reuolted. But God had performed that which Frier <hi>Ierom</hi> promiſed, to wit, that the honor of the field ſhould be ours; for conſidering our ſmall experience and euill gouernment, we were vnwoorthie of this good ſucceſſe that God gaue vs, bicauſe we could not then tell how to vſe it: but I thinke if at this preſent, which is the yeere of our Lord 1497. the like victorie ſhould happen to the King; he could tell better how to make his profit thereof.</p>
               <p>While we ſtood debating this matter, the night approched, and the band of our enimies, which we ſaw before vs, retired into their campe, and we for our part went and lodged about a quarter of a league from the place of the battell. The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe lay in a farme houſe, being an old beggerly thing; notwithſtanding the barnes about it were full of corne vnthreſhed, which I warrant you our army quickly found. Certaine other old houſes there were alſo, which ſtood vs but in ſmall ſtead: euery man lodged himſelfe as commodiouſly as he could; for we had no lodgings made. As touching my ſelfe I lay vpon the bare ground vnder a vine, in a very ſtraight roome, hauing nothing vnder me, no not my cloke: for the K. had borrowed mine in the morning, and my carriage was far off, and it was too late to ſeeke it. He that had meate ate it, but few there were that had any, vnleſſe it were a morſell of bread, ſnatched out of ſome of their ſeruants boſoms: I waited vpon the King to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where he found certaine that were hurt, namely the Seneſchall of Lyons and others, whom he cauſed to be dreſſed. Himſelfe was merrie and made good cheere,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7649:178"/>
and each man thought himſelfe happy that he was ſo well eſcaped: neither were we puffed vp with pride and vaineglorie, as before the battell, bicauſe we ſawe our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies encamped ſo neere vs. The ſame night all our Almaines kept the watch, and the King gaue them three hundred crownes; whereupon they kept the watch very diligently, and ſtrake vp their drums brauely.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next morning I determined to continue our treatie of peace, deſiring nothing more than the Kings ſafe paſſage. But I could get neuer a Trumpeter to go to the enimies campe, partly bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nine of theirs were ſlaine in the battell being vnknowen, &amp; partly bicauſe they had taken one of ours, and ſlaine another, whom the King (as you haue hard) ſent to them a little before the battell began: notwithſtanding in the end one went and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Kings ſafe conduct with him, and brought me one from them to commune in the midway between both the armies, which me thought was a hard matter to be brought to paſſe, but I would not ſeeme to draw backe nor make difficultie therin. The King named the Cardinall of Saint Malo, the Lord of Gie Marſhall of Fraunce, and the Lord of Piennes his Chamberlaine to accompany me: and they named for them, the Marques of Mantua Generall of the Venetians army, the Earle of Caiazze (who not long before had taken part with vs, and was captaine of the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7649:178"/>
forces the Duke of Milan had there) and Maſter <hi>Luques Piſan,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Melchior Treuiſan</hi> prouiſors of the ſeniorie of Venice. We approched ſo neere them, that we might eaſily deſcry them fower vpon the plaine. The riuer ran between vs and them, which was riſen exceedingly ſince the day before: on their ſide there was not one man without their campe but themſelues onely, neither any on ours, but onely we &amp; our watch which ſtood ouer againſt them. We ſent a herault to them to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would paſſe the riuer, whereunto me thought it a hard matter to perſwade either partie, for I ſuppoſed both parties would make difficulty therein as well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered by them: for they anſwered that the place of communication was appointed in the midway betweene both the armies, and that they were come already more than the halfe way: wherefore they would not paſſe the riuer, nor put themſelues in ſuch danger being all the principall of their armie. They alſo of our ſide alleaged the like doubts, making no leſſe account of their perſons than the others. Wherfore they willed me to go to them, giuing me no inſtructions for my direction: I anſwered that I would not go alone, but would haue ſome body with me to teſtifie of all that ſhould be done. Wherfore being accompanied with one Maſter <hi>Robertet</hi> the Kings Secretarie, and a ſeruant of mine owne, and an herault, I paſſed the riuer: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that I wel perceiued I ſhould do no good, yet thought I by this means to acquite my ſelfe towards them, being come thither by my procurement. When I came to them, I told them they were not come halfe the way according to their promiſe, wherefore I deſired them, at the leaſt to come to the riuers ſide, aſſuring my ſelfe that if we were once ſo high togither, we ſhould not depart without commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. They anſwered, that the riuer was ſo brode, and ran with ſo great violence and noiſe, that no talke could be heard from the one ſide to the other; wherefore they would go no neerer to parlament, neither could I by any meanes bring them one foote further: but they willed me to make ſome ouerture, which I had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to do. Wherefore I anſwered, that alone I could do nothing; but if they would propound any conditions of peace, I would make report thereof to the King. While we were in this communication, one of our heraults arriued, who brought me word that the Lords aboue named that had accompanied me, were ready to depart, and willed me to make what ouerture I thought good; which I refuſed to do, bicauſe they vnderſtood further of the Kings pleaſure than I did: for they were neerer him than I was, and had alſo talked with him in his eare at our departure: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding as touching theſe affaires which I now ſpeake of, I vnderſtood what was to be done in them as well as the beſt of them. The Marqueſſe of Mantua entred into great communication with me of the battell, &amp; asked me (if he had been taken) whether the King would haue ſlaine him. I anſwered, no; but haue entertained him well, alleaging that he had good cauſe to loue him, ſeeing the honor he had woon by his aſſailing him. Then he recommended vnto me the priſoners we had, eſpecially his vncle the Lord <hi>Rodolph,</hi> whom he ſuppoſed to be yet liuing: but I knew well the contrarie; notwithſtanding I anſwered, that all the priſoners ſhould be well intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and recommended in like maner to him the baſtard of Bourbon whom they had taken. Small entertainment would ſerue all the priſoners we had; for we had none, which I ſuppoſe neuer happened before in any battell. But the ſaid Marqueſſe loſt there of his kinſmen to the number of ſeuen or eight, and of his owne companie at the leaſt ſixſcore men of armes. This talke being ended, I tooke my leaue of them, ſaying, that before night I would returne againe; whereupon we made truce till night.</p>
               <p>At my returne to the King with the ſaid Secretarie, they asked me what newes, and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7649:179"/>
the King ſate in counſel in a poore chamber where nothing was concluded, but each man beheld other. The King talked with the Cardinall in his eare, and afterward bad me returne againe to the enimies to ſee what they would ſay. But bicauſe this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of peace proceeded of me, the enimies looked that I ſhould make ſome ouerture and not they. Afterward the Cardinall bad me conclude nothing, but that ſpeech was needleſſe, for I was not like to conclude any thing, bicauſe they gaue me no direction: notwithſtanding I would not replie to the Kings commandement, nor breake off my iourney; for beſides that I was ſure to do no harme, I was in ſome hope to gather ſomwhat by our enimies countenances, who vndoubtedly were more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid than we, and happily might paſſe ſome ſpeeches that would turne both the parties to good. Wherefore I tooke my iorney thitherward, and came to the riuers ſide almoſt at night, where one of their trumpeters met me, and aduertiſed me that the fower aboue named ſent me word to paſſe no further that night, bicauſe their watch was already ſet, being altogither of Eſtradiots, who knew not one man from another, wherefore I might happily endanger my ſelfe, if I paſſed further: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the trumpeter offered to tarry with me all night, to the end he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey me thither the next morning: but I ſent him backe againe, ſaying that the next morning I would returne to the riuers ſide where I willed him to tarie me, or if the K. ſhould otherwiſe determine, I promiſed to ſend thither a herald to aduertiſe them therof; for I would not bring this trumpeter into our campe, partly bicauſe I would not haue him priuy to our actions there that night: and partly bicauſe I knew not what the King meant to do, for I ſawe whiſpering in his eare, which put me in ſome doubt, wherefore I returned to aduertiſe the King what I had done.</p>
               <p>Euery man ſupped with that he could get, and ſlept vpon the ground. Soone after midnight I repaired to the Kings chamber, where I found his chamberlaines readie to mount on horſebacke, who told me that the King would depart with all ſpeed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Aſt, and the Marchioneſſe of Montferrates territories, willing me to ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, to hold the Parlament according to my promiſe: but I made my excuſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I would not willingly kill my ſelfe, but be on horſebacke with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. Soone after the King aroſe and heard maſſe, and mounted on horſebacke. Not paſt an hower before day, a trumpeter ſounded <hi>Bon guet,</hi> but at our diſlod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging nothing was ſounded, neither needed it, for euery man was in a readines. Notwithſtanding this was ſufficient to haue put the whole army in feare, at the leaſt thoſe that were acquainted with the wars: for beſides this we turned our backes to our enimies, ſeeking wholie our owne ſaftety, which is a dangerous matter in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Further, the waies at our departure from our lodging were very cumberſome, in ſuch ſort that we were forced to march ouer mountaines, and through woods, and by-waies, for we had no guides to lead vs: my ſelfe heard the ſoldiers aske the enſigne bearers, and him that executed the office of Maſter of the horſe, where the guides were, who anſwered that there were none. To ſay the truth we needed none, for as God alone had guided the armie at our going foorth: euen ſo (according to Frier <hi>Hieromes</hi> propheſie) meant he to do at our returne: otherwiſe it is not to be thought that ſuch a prince would haue ridden in the night without a guide, in a place where ynow might haue been had. But God ſhewed yet a manifeſter token that he meant to preſerue vs, for our enimies vnderſtood nothing of our departure till the afternoone, but waited for this parlamenting I had begun: beſides that, the riuer was riſen ſo high, that it was fower of the clocke at after noone before any man durſt aduenture ouer to follow vs, and then paſſed the Earle of Caiazze with two hundred Italian light horſe, in ſuch danger bicauſe of the force of the water, that one or two
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7649:179"/>
of his men were drowned, as himſelfe afterward confeſſed. We trauelled ouer hils and through woods, and were conſtrained by the ſpace of ſixe miles to marche one by one after another in the narrow waies, and then came we to a goodly large plain, where our vaward, artillerie, and carriage lay, which ſeemed ſo great a band a far off, that at the firſt we ſtood in feare of them, bicauſe Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> of Trenoules enſigne was ſquare and white, like to the Marques of Mantuas the day of the battel. The ſaid vaward was in like maner afeard of our rereward, which they ſaw a farre off forſake the high way to come the next way to them, whereupon both they and we ſet our ſelues in order of battell: but this feare ſoone ended, for the ſcoutes iſſued foorth on both ſides, and diſcried one an other incontinent. From thence we went to refreſh vs at Bourg Saint Denis, where we our ſelues made an alarme of purpoſe to retire our Almains out of the towne, leaſt they ſhould haue ſpoiled it. Thence we remooued and lodged all night at Florenſole, the ſecond night we encamped neere to Plaiſance, and paſſed the riuer of Trebia, leauing on the other ſide of the riuer two hundred launces, all our Swiſſers, and all the artillerie except ſixe peeces, which the King paſſed ouer with him. For he had giuen this order, to the end he might be the better and more commodiouſly lodged, thinking to command them to paſſe at his pleaſure, bicauſe the riuer is commonly very ſhallow, eſpecially at that time of the yeere: notwithſtanding about ten of the clocke at night, it aroſe ſo high that no man could paſſe ouer it, neither on horſebacke nor on foote, neither could the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany haue ſuccoured the other, which was a great danger, conſidering how neer our enimies were to vs. Al that night both they and we ſought to remedy this miſchiefe, but no helpe could be found till the water fell of it ſelfe, which was about fiue of the clocke in the morning, and then we ſtretched coardes from the one ſide to the other to helpe ouer the footemen, who waded in the water vp to their necks: immediately after them paſſed alſo our horſemen and our artillerie. This was a ſudden and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous aduenture, conſidering the place where we were, for our enimies lay hard by vs, I meane the garriſon of Plaiſance, &amp; the Earle of Caiazze, who was entred in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bicauſe certaine of the citizens practiſed to put the town into the Kings hands, vnder the title of the yoong Duke ſonne to <hi>Iohn Galeas,</hi> Duke of Milan that laſt died, as before you haue heard. And vndoubtedly if the King would haue giuen eare to this practiſe, a great number of townes and noble men would haue reuolted by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> of Treuoules meanes: but he refuſed ſo to do, bicauſe of the fauour he bare the D. of Orleans his coſin, who was already entred into Nouarre, although to ſay the truth on the other ſide he deſired not greatly to ſee his ſaid coſin ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wherefore he was well content to let this matter paſſe as it came. The third daie after our departure from the place of the battell the K. dined at the caſtle S. Iohn &amp; lodged all night in a wood. The fourth day he dined at Voghera, &amp; laie that night at Pontcuron. The fift day he lodged neere to Tortone and paſſed the riuer of Scriuia which <hi>Fracaſſe</hi> defended with the garriſon of Tortone, being vnder his charge for the D. of Milan. But when he vnderſtood by thoſe that made the K. lodging that he would onely paſſe without doing harme to any man, he retired again into the town, and ſent vs word that we ſhould haue as great plenty of victuals as we would; which promiſe he alſo performed: for all our armie paſſed hard by the gate of Tortone, where the ſaid <hi>Fracaſſe</hi> came forth to welcom the King, being armed, but accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied onely with two men: he excuſed himſelfe very humbly to the King, that he lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him not in the towne, &amp; ſent out great ſtore of victuals, which refreſhed well our army, &amp; at night came alſo himſelfe to the Kings lodging. For you ſhal vnderſtand, that he was of the houſe of S. Seuerin, brother to the Earle of Caiazze and Maſter
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7649:180"/>
                  <hi>Galeas,</hi> and had not long before been in the Kings ſeruice in Romania, as you haue heard. From thence the King remooued to Nice de la Paille in the Marquiſat of Montferrat, whereof we were right glad, bicauſe we were then in ſafetie, and in our friends countrie. For theſe light horſemen that the Earle of Caiazze led, were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually at our backe, and traueiled vs maruellouſly the three or fower firſt daies, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our horſemen would not put themſelues behinde to make reſiſtance: for the neerer we approched to the place of ſafetie, the more vnwilling were our men to fight; and ſome ſay, ſuch is the nature of vs French men. Wherefore the Italians write in their hiſtories, that the French men at their arriuall are better than men; but at their returne woorſe than women. The firſt point vndoubtedly is true: for they are the rougheſt men to encounter with in the world, I meane the horſemen: but all men at their returne from an enterpriſe are leſſe couragious than at their departure from their houſes. Now to proceede, our backs were defended by three hundred Almaines, hauing among them a great band of harquebuſiers on foote, with whom alſo a number of harquebuſiers on horſebacke were ioined: theſe made their Eſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diots, being but few in number, to retire. Further, notwithſtanding that their whole armie which had fought with vs, marched after vs as faſt as they might, yet could they not ouertake vs, both bicauſe they were departed from the place of the battell a day after vs; and alſo bicauſe of their barded horſes, ſo that we loſt not one man vpon the way. The ſaid armie neuer came within a mile of vs; wherefore ſeeing they could not ouertake vs, and peraduenture not greatly deſirous ſo to do, they marched ſtraight towards Nouarre, whither both the Duke of Milan and the Venetians had already ſent certaine bands, as before you haue heard. But if they could haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken vs neere to the places of our retrait, peraduenture they might haue ſped better than in the valley of Fornoue.</p>
               <p>I haue ſhewed before ſufficiently in diuers places how God guided this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, but yet for further proofe thereof, a word or two more. You ſhall vnderſtand therefore, that notwithſtanding that from the day of the battell till our arriuall at the ſaid place of Nice de la Paille, the lodgings were vnorderly and vnequally made; yet euery man lodged with patience as commodiouſly as he could, without ſtrife or contention. Of victuals we had great lacke: notwithſtanding they of the countrey brought vs ſome, who might eaſily haue poiſoned vs if they would, both in their meates and wines, and alſo in their wels and waters, which were dried vp ſometimes in a moment, bicauſe they were but ſmall ſprings. If they had minded to haue poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, they would ſure haue done it; but bicauſe they did it not, it is to be thought that our Sauiour and redeemer Ieſus Chriſt tooke from them all deſire to do it. I ſaw ſuch thirſt in our armie, that a number of footemen dranke of ſtinking puddles in the villages through the which we paſſed. Our iourneies were long, and our drinke foule ſtanding water, which notwithſtanding our men were ſo greedy of, that they ran into the pooles vp to the girdleſtead to drinke. For you ſhall vnderſtand, that a number of people followed vs, being no men of war, bicauſe our carriage was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous great. The King departed from his lodging euery morning before day, and I remember not that euer he had guide. Moreouer, he rode till noone before he bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and euery man made prouiſion for himſelfe, and looked to his owne horſe, and was forced to prouide prouender for him, and to beare it to him in his armes, as my ſelfe did twiſe; and two daies I ate nothing but naughty blacke bread: yet was I none of thoſe that ſtood in moſt neede. Sure one thing was eſpecially to be commended in this armie, to wit, that neuer man complained of neceſſitie, yet was this the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt voiage that euer I ſaw; notwithſtanding that I haue been in diuers ſharp &amp; hard
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:7649:180"/>
voiages with <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Burgundie. We marched no faſter than the great artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, the mending whereof often troubled vs: beſides that, we lacked horſes to draw it; but at all times when we ſtood in neede, we borrowed of the gentlemen in our armie, who willingly lent theirs; ſo that there was not one peece nor one pound of powder loſt. And I thinke neuer man ſaw artillerie of ſuch greatnes paſſe ſo ſpeedily ouer ſuch places as this did. All this diſorder both in our lodgings and all other things, happened not for lacke of wiſe and expert men in the campe, but it was their chaunce to haue leaſt credit at that time; for the King was yoong and wedded to his owne will, as before you haue heard. To conclude therefore, it ſeemed that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt would, that the honor of this voiage ſhould be attributed wholy to him. The ſeuenth day after our departure from the place of the battell, we marched from Nice de la Paille, and encamped all togither hard by Alexandria; our watch that night being very ſtrong. The next morning before day we departed and went to Aſt: the King and his houſhold lodged in the towne, but the ſoldiers encamped without: we found the ſaid towne of Aſt furniſhed of all kinde of victuals, wherwith the whole armie was well refreſhed, which vndoubtedly ſtood in great neede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, bicauſe they had indured great hunger, thirſt and heate, and lacked ſleepe; beſides that, their apparell was all tottered and torne. Immediately after the Kings arriuall thither, before I ſlept, I ſent a gentleman called <hi>Philip de la Coudre</hi> (who ſomtime had been my ſeruant, and ſerued then the Duke of Orleans) to Nouarre, where the ſaid Duke was beſieged by his enimies, as you may vnderſtand by that which is aboue rehearſed: but the ſiege was not yet ſo ſtraight but that men might paſſe in and out, bicauſe the enimies onely endeuor was to famiſh the towne. I aduertiſed the Duke by this gentleman, of diuers treaties that were entertained betweene the King and the Duke of Milan, in one of the which my ſelfe negotiated by the Duke of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raraes meanes; wherefore I aduiſed him to repaire to the King, hauing firſt aſſured his men whom he ſhould leaue behinde him, either ſhortly to returne, or bring force to leuie the ſiege. Within the ſaid towne were with him to the number of 7500. ſoldiers both French and Swiſſers, being as goodly a band, ſo many for ſo many, as euer was ſeene. The King the next day after his arriuall, was aduertiſed both by the ſaid Duke of Orleans and others, that the two armies were ioined togither before Nouarre: wherefore the ſaid Duke deſired aide, bicauſe his victuals daily diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the which they had giuen no order at their firſt entrie into the towne. For they might then haue recouered ynow in the townes about, eſpecially corne; and if their prouiſion had been made in time, and well looked to, they ſhould neuer haue been forced to yeeld the towne: for if they could haue held it but one moneth lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they had come foorth with honor, and their enimies departed with ſhame.</p>

               <p>While the King lay at Thurin, diuers treaties were entertained between him and the Duke of Milan: in one of the which the Duches of Sauoy was a dealer, ſhe was daughter to the Marques of Montferratte, and a widow, and mother to the yoong Duke of Sauoy then liuing. Others negotiated alſo as well as ſhe: and among the reſt my ſelfe laboured for concluſion of the peace as before I haue made mention; and the confederats, that is to ſay, the captaines that were in the enimies campe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Nouarre, deſired to deale with me, and ſent me a ſafe conduct. But enuie euer raigneth in Princes courts; for the Cardinall ſo often aboue named, ouerthrew all that I did, and would that the Duches of Sauois negotiation ſhould go forward, which was committed to the ſaid Cardinals hoſte, who was Treaſurer of Sauoy, a wiſe man and a faithfull ſeruant to his Miſtres. This treatie endured ſo long without effect that in the end all hope of peace ceaſing, the Bailife of Digeon was ſent am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador into Swiſſerland to leuy there fiue thouſand men.</p>
               <p>I haue made mention already how the Kings Nauie that departed from Nice in prouence to ſuccour the caſtels of Naples, could not ſuccour them for the reaſons there rehearſed. Wherefore the Lord of Montpenſier and the other gentlemen that were with him in the caſtels vnderſtanding of this misfortune, eſpied a conuenient time when the army that the King left behinde him in diuers parts of the realme lay neere to the ſaid caſtles, and by helpe therof ſalied foorth (leauing within force ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for their defence according to the proportion of their victuals which was very ſmal) and departed themſelues with two thouſand and fiue hundred ſoldiers, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Ognas</hi> and two other gentlemen captaines of the caſtles. The ſaid L. of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſier, the Prince of Salerne, the Seneſchall of Beaucaire, and the reſt that were with them departed to Salerne, for the which cauſe King <hi>Ferrand</hi> ſaid, that he might lawfully put to death the hoſtages deliuered to him a few daies before, whoſe names were theſe, the Lord of Alegre, one called <hi>de la Marche-d' Ardaine,</hi> the Lord <hi>de la Chapelle d'Aniou,</hi> one named <hi>Roquebertin Catelin,</hi> and one <hi>Genly:</hi> for you ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that not paſt three moneths before, the ſaid King <hi>Ferrand</hi> was entred into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by intelligence, or rather through the negligence of our men, who vnderſtood of all their practiſes in the towne, and yet neuer ſought to countermine them. But heereof I will write no farther, bicauſe I ſpeake but vpon report: for notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that I had mine intelligence from the principall of thoſe that were there, yet do I not willingly diſcourſe long of any matter, that I haue not been preſent at my ſelfe. The ſaid K. <hi>Ferrand</hi> being in Naples, was aduertiſed that the King was ſlaine at the battell of Fornoue, as were our men alſo within the caſtle by the Duke of Milans letters, to the which credit was giuen: notwithſtanding that they reported no thing but lies. And thereupon the Coulonnois (whoſe maner is, alwaies to turne with the ſtrongeſt) reuolted incontinent from vs, though ſundry waies bound to the King, as before you haue heard. Wherefore our men (partlie through theſe vntrue reports, but eſpecially bicauſe a great number of them were retired into the caſtell, being vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:7649:181"/>
vnfurniſhed of victuals, and partly alſo bicauſe they had loſt their horſes, and all their goods within the towne:) made a compoſition, the ſixt day of October in the yeere 1495. after they had been beſieged three moneths &amp; fowerteen daies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing if they were not ſuccoured within a certaine ſpace, to depart into Prouence, and yeeld the caſtels without making further war, either by ſea or land vpon the realme of Naples; for the performance of which conditions they deliuered theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages aboue named; and yet within twentie daies after the compoſition, departed as you haue heard: for the which cauſe King <hi>Ferrand</hi> ſaid that they had broken the compoſition in that they departed without leaue: and notwithſtanding that our men maintained the contrary, yet were the hoſtages in great danger and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe. For although I will not denie but that our men did wiſely to depart not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the compoſition; yet had they done much better if the day of their departure they had yeelded the caſtles for their hoſtages ſafetie, and receiued again the ſaid hoſtages. For the caſtels held but twenty daies after they were departed, partly for lacke of victuals; and partly bicauſe they deſpaired of ſuccours.

The King therefore ſeeing his enimies forces daily to increaſe, and that no honorable end could be made, was aduiſed to remooue to Verceil, there to deuiſe ſome way to ſaue the Duke of Orleans and his company, who (as before you haue heard) had giuen no order at all for their victuals at their firſt entrie into Nouarre. And ſure the Duke ſhould haue done much better, in following the aduiſe I gaue him at the Kings returne to Aſt, as before is mentioned; which was to depart out of Nouarre, putting all that were vnable to do ſeruice out of the towne, and to repaire himſelfe to the King: for his preſence would much haue furthered his affaires, at the leaſt thoſe that he had left behinde him, ſhould not haue ſuffered ſuch extreme famine as they did: for he would haue made a compoſition ſooner, when he had ſeene no remedie. But the Archbiſhop of Rouen, who had been with him in Nouarre from the very beginning; and for the furtherance of his affaires was come to the King, and preſent at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating of all matters; ſent him word daily not to depart, bicauſe ſhortly he ſhould be ſuccoured, grounding himſelfe wholy vpon the Cardinall of Saint Malos pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, who had all the credit with the King. Good affection cauſed him to write thus, but I was well aſſured of the contrarie. For no man would returne to the battell, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the King went in perſon; and as touching him he deſired nothing leſſe: for this was but a priuate quarrell for one towne which the Duke of Orleans would needes retaine, and the Duke of Milan needes haue reſtored, bicauſe it is but ten leagues from Milan; ſo that of neceſſitie one of them muſt haue had all. For there are in the Duchie of Milan nine or ten great cities, the one neere to the other. Further, the Duke of Milan ſaid, that in reſtoring Nouarre, and not demanding Genua, he would do any thing for the King. We ſent meale oftentimes to Nouarre, whereof the halfe was euer loſt vpon the way; and once ſixtie men of armes were defeated going thither, being led by a yoong gentleman of the Kings houſe, named <hi>Chaſtillon:</hi> ſome of them were taken, ſome entred the towne, and the reſt hardly eſcaped. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to expreſſe the great miſerie of our men within Nouarre; for euery day ſome died of famine, and two parts of them were ſicke, ſo that pitious letters came from thence in cipher, though with great difficultie. They receiued euer faire promiſes, and all was but abuſe. But thoſe that gouerned the Kings affaires deſired the battell, not conſidering that no man was of that opinion but themſelues: for all the beſt men of war in the armie, namely, the Prince of Orenge lately arriued, and to whom the K. gaue great credit in martiall affairs, and all the other captains, deſired to make a good end by treatie. For winter approched, we were vnfurniſhed of monie, the number of the French was ſmall, and many of them ſicke; ſo that they departed daily, ſome with the Kings leaue, and ſome without leaue: but notwithſtanding all theſe inconueniences, all the wiſe men in the campe could not diſſwade thoſe aboue mentioned, from ſending word to the Duke of Orleans not to depart the towne; whereby vndoubtedly they greatly endangered him. And this they did, bicauſe they truſted vpon the great force of Almaines, whereof the Bailife of Digeon aſſured them; to whom alſo certaine of them ſent word to bring as many as he could le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie.

               <p>Thoſe that would haue no peace, nor meeting to treate thereof, alleaged that the enimies ought to make the firſt ouuerture, and not the K. but they on the other ſide ſaid, that they would not firſt begin: in the meane time the miſery of our men in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre daily increaſed, in ſuch ſort, that now their letters made mention only of thoſe
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7649:182"/>
that died daily for hunger, and that they could hold the towne but ten daies, and afterward eight daies, yea and once they came to three daies, but they had firſt paſſed their day before prefixed. To be ſhort, ſo great extremitie hath not been ſeene of long time, no I am ſure that a hundred yeeres before we were borne, neuer men ſuſtained ſo great famine as they.</p>
               <p>In the meane time died the Marchioneſſe of Montferrat (a great friend to the French,) wherupon ſome ſtrife aroſe in that countrey for the gouernment, the which on the one ſide the Marques of Saluce demanded, and on the other the Lord <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> vnckle to the ſaid Marchioneſſe, who was a Greeke, and ſhe a Greekeſſe, daughter to the King of Seruia, but the Turke had deſtroied them both. The ſaid Lord <hi>Constantine</hi> had fortified himſelfe in the caſtell of Caſal, and had in his hands the late Marques his two ſonnes, begotten of this wiſe and beautiful Lady, the which died the 29. yeere of hir age, hir eldeſt ſonne being but nine yeeres old. Other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men alſo aſpired to the gouernment, ſo that great part taking aroſe about that matter in our campe. The King commanded me to to thither, and determine the controuerſie for the childrens ſafetie, and to the contentation of the greateſt part of the people. For he feared that this variance would make them call the Duke of Milan into their countrey, greatly to our diſcontentment: for the friendſhip of this houſe of Montferrat ſtood vs in great ſtead. I was loth to depart before I had brought into better tune thoſe that contraried the peace: for I conſidered both the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences aboue rehearſed, and alſo that winter approched, and feared leaſt theſe Prelats ſhould perſwade the King to aduenture another battell, whoſe power was ſmall, vnleſſe great force of Swiſſers hapned to come, and though ſo many came as they vaunted of, yet ſeemed it to me a dangerous caſe to put the King and his eſtate into their hands. Further, our enimies were mightie, and lodged in a ſtrong place, and well fortified. Wherefore all theſe points being well weighed, I aduentured to perſwade the King not to hazard his perſon and eſtate for a trifle. I deſired him to remember the great danger he was in at Fornoue, which could not then be auoided bicauſe neceſſitie forced him to fight: but now (I ſaid) there was no ſuch neceſſitie. I aduiſed him further, not to refuſe a good end, bicauſe of this fond obiection, that he ought not firſt to breake the ice, for if it ſo pleaſed him, I would finde meanes that ouuertures ſhould be made in ſuch ſort, that the honor of both parties ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. He bad me repaire to the Cardinall; and ſo I did: but the Cardinall gaue me ſtrange anſwers, and deſired the battell, aſſuring himſelfe of the victorie: and further alleaging that the Duke of Orleans had promiſed him ten thouſand ducats of yeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuenues for one of his ſonnes, if he obtained the Duchie of Milan. The next day, as I went to take my leaue of the King to depart to Caſal (being diſtant from thence about a daies iourney and a halfe) I met with Monſeur <hi>de la Trimoille</hi> by the waie, whom I aduertiſed of my communication had with the King: and bicauſe he was neere about him, I asked his aduiſe whether I ſhould preſſe forward the matter, whereunto he earneſtly perſwaded me, for al men deſired to repaire home. The King was in a garden, and when I came to him, I began to perſwade with him (as the daie before) in preſence of the Cardinall, who anſwered me that it appertained to him being a church man, to be the firſt moouer of the King to peace: whereunto I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that if he would not, I would. For I perceiued well that both the King and thoſe that were neereſt about him deſired to returne home. Then I tooke my leaue, and at my departure told the Prince of Orenge (who had the principall charge of the army) that if I entred into any communication of peace, I would addreſſe my ſelfe wholy to him. This being done I tooke my iourney towards Caſall, where I was well
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7649:183"/>
receiued by the whole kinred of this houſe of Montferrat, and found the greateſt part of them inclined to the Lord <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> whoſe gouernment was thought by them all moſt conuenient for the childrens ſafetie, bicauſe he could pretend no title to the ſucceſſion as the Marques of Saluce did. I aſſembled by the ſpace of certaine daies both the Nobles of the countrey, the Spirituall men, and the Burgeſſes of the good townes, and at the requeſt of them, at the leaſt the greateſt part of them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Kings pleaſure to be, that the Lord <hi>Constantine</hi> ſhould remaine gouernor. For I was ſure they would not withſtande the Kings commandement, both bicauſe of the force he had then on that ſide the mountaines, and alſo bicauſe of the good affection the whole countrey beareth to the houſe of Fraunce.</p>
               <p>About three daies after my arriuall at Caſal, the Marqueſſe of Mantua the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians Generall, ſent the ſteward of his houſe thither to condole the late deceaſed Marchioneſſe death: for the ſaid Marqueſſe was of kin to this houſe of Montferrat. The ſame Steward and I entered into communication how we might agree theſe two armies without battell: for both the parties diſpoſed themſelues to fight, and the King lay in campe neere to Verceil, but to ſay the truth he did but paſſe the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer onely <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP9.NOTE2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> and lodge his campe, which was vtterly vnprouided of tents and pauili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for our men had brought foorth but few with them, and thoſe few alſo were loſt. Moreouer the ground was wet, both bicauſe winter approched, and bicauſe the countrey lieth low. The King lodged in his campe but one night, and the next day returned to the towne: but the Prince of Orenge abode ſtill with the army, ſo did alſo the Earle of Foix, and the Earle of Vendoſme, who fell into a fluxe there where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he died, which ſure was great pitie: for he was a goodly gentleman, yoong, and wiſe, and was come thither in poſte, bicauſe the brute ran that there we ſhould fight. For you ſhall vnderſtand that he had not beene with the King in this voiage into Italy. Beſides theſe the Marſhall of Gie abode alſo in the campe and diuers other captaines, but the greateſt force were the Almaines that had beene with the King in this voiage: for the French men would by no meanes lodge abrode, the towne being ſo neere; beſides that, diuers of them were ſicke, and many returned home ſome with leaue, &amp; ſome without leaue. Nouarre was diſtant from our campe ten great Italian miles, containing ſix French leagues at the leſt, the way is cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: for the ground is tough and ſoft as in Flaunders, bicauſe of ditches that are on both ſides of the way, much deeper than the ditches of Flaunders. In winter the waies there are very foule, and in ſommer maruellous duſtie. Moreouer, betweene our campe and Nouarre, there was a little place which we held, called Bourg, about a league from vs, and another that they held about a league from their campe, called Camarian. But the waters were riſen ſo high, that a man could hardly paſſe between vs and them.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſſe of Mantuas ſteward aboue mentioned that was come to Caſall and I, continued ſtill our communication of peace, and diuers reaſons I alleaged to him to perſwade his Maſter to ſhun the battell. Firſt, I put him in minde of the great danger he had beene in at Fornoue: ſecondarily, I told him that he fought for them that neuer had aduaunced him, notwithſtanding the great ſeruices he had done them: wherefore his beſt way ſhould be to incline to peace, which I for my part promiſed to further on our ſide as much as in me lay. He anſwered, that his Maſter deſired nothing more than peace, but that we muſt make the firſt motion thereof, as word had been ſent me heertofore, conſidering that their league, that is to ſay, the Pope, the Kings of Romanes and Spaine, the Venetians, and the Duke of Milan were more woorthie than the King alone. I anſwered, that to make ſuch a ceremonie
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7649:183"/>
about ſo ſmall a trifle, was meere follie: notwithſtanding if any ceremonie were to be obſerued, that the King ought to haue the preheminence and honor thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that himſelfe was there in perſon, and the others had but their lieutenants there. But to auoid all ſuch fond cauillation, I offered that he and I iointly as media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (if he ſo thought good) would breake the yce, ſo that I were ſure his Maſter the Marqueſſe of Mantua would agree therunto, and proceeded accordingly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we concluded, that the next day I ſhould ſend a trumpeter to their campe, by whom I ſhould write to Maſter <hi>Lucas Piſan,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Melchior Treuiſan</hi> the two Venetian Prouiſors, the which are officers appointed to conſult with their captains, and to prouide things neceſſarie for their armie. According to the which reſolution, the next morning I writ vnto them the effect of that I had ſaid before to the ſteward: for I had good colour to continue ſtill a mediator, bicauſe I had promiſed ſo to do at my departure from Venice. Beſides that, I was ſure the King deſired peace, and me thought that alſo our affaires required it. Laſtly, there are euer men ynow to breake off a good appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but few that haue skil &amp; wil withal to trauel for the pacifying of ſo great a controuerſie, nor that will endure ſo many hard ſpeeches as are vſed of them that deale in ſuch affaires; for in great armies all are not of one humor. The ſaid Prouiſors were glad of theſe newes, and promiſed that I ſhould ſhortly haue anſwer of my letter: whereof foorthwith they ſent word to Venice in poſt, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued anſwere with great expedition from the Seniorie, and not long after, ſent an Earle that ſerued the Duke of Ferrara, to our campe. The ſaid Duke had men in their armie; for his eldeſt ſonne was in pay with the Duke of Milan <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP9.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>, but another of his ſonnes with the King our Maſter. This Earles name was <hi>Albertin,</hi> and he pretended openly, that the occaſion of his arriuall was to viſite Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> of Treuoul, with whom he had a ſonne in ſeruice <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP9.NOTE4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref>. He addreſſed himſelfe to the Prince of Orenge, according to the ſtewards agreement and mine at our departure from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and aduertiſed him that he had a commiſſion from the Marqueſſe of Mantua, the Prouiſors, and the other captaines of their armie, to demaund a ſafe conduct for the ſaid Marqueſſe and others, to the number of fiftie horſes, to come and treate with ſuch as it ſhould pleaſe the King to appoint; for they acknowledged that it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſhould firſt come to the King and his Commiſſioners, and declared alſo that they would do him that honor. Afterward the ſaid Earle deſired to commune with the King apart: which his requeſt being granted; he then counſelled him not to make peace, reporting our enimies armie to be in ſo great feare, that ſhortly they would raiſe their ſiege &amp; depart: by which words he ſeemed rather deſirous to break off the treatie than to further it; notwithſtanding that his commiſſion openly were ſuch as you haue heard. At this communication M. <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> of Treuoul was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who bicauſe he was great enimie to the Duke of Milan, would alſo gladly haue broken off the treatie. But aboue all others, the Duke of Ferrara the ſaid Earle <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertins</hi> Maſter (being newly arriued at the Duke of Milans campe, who had married his daughter) deſired war; for he was great enimie to the Venetians, bicauſe they withheld from him diuers countries, namely, the Poleſan and others. After the King had communed with this Earle, he ſent for me, and debated with his Counſell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould grant this ſafe conduct or not. Thoſe that would gladly haue broken off the treatie, as Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames,</hi> and others (who ſpake in fauor of the Duke of Orleans, as they pretended) deſired the battell, ſaying, that they were ſure the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would ſhortly diſlodge bicauſe they ſtarued for hunger: but the greateſt part of thoſe that gaue this aduiſe were clergie men, who would not haue been at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell themſelues. Diuers others, and my ſelfe among the reſt, were of the contrarie
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7649:184"/>
opinion, ſaying, that we ſhould ſooner ſtarue for hunger than they, being in their owne countrie. And as touching their diſlodging we anſwered, that their force was too great to flie for feare of vs, &amp; by that means to caſt themſelues away. Wherfore theſe words (we ſaid) proceeded of men that would haue vs fight &amp; hazard our liues for their particular quarrels. To be ſhort, the ſafe conduct was granted and ſent, and promiſe made, that the next day by two of the clocke at after noone, the Prince of Orenge, the Marſhall of Gie, the Lord of Piennes, and my ſelfe ſhould meete the ſaid Marqueſſe and his collegues betweene Bourg and Camarian, neere to a towne where they kept their watch, to the end we might there commune togither. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the which appointment the next day thither we went, accompanied with a good band of ſoldiers: and there the ſaid Marqueſſe of Mantua and a Venetian that had the charge of their Eſtradiots met vs <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP9.NOTE5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref>, and gaue vs very courteous language, ſaying, that for their parts they deſired peace. Further, we there concluded, that to the end we might the more conueniently commune togither, they ſhould ſend cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Commiſſioners to our campe, and afterward the King certaine of his to them: whereunto they agreed, and ſent vnto vs the next day on the Duke of Milans behalfe Maſter <hi>Franciſco Bernardin</hi> Viſcomte, and with him one of the Marqueſſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuas Secretaries; with whom we aboue named, and the Cardinall of S. Malo began to negotiate. They demanded Nouarre where the Duke of Orleans was beſieged, and we Genua, ſaying, that it was held of the King by homage, and that the Duke of Milan had taken it by confiſcation <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP9.NOTE6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref>. Then they made their excuſes, ſaying, that they had attempted nothing againſt the King, but onely in their owne defence, that the Duke of Orleans had taken the ſaid citie of Nouarre with the Kings forces, and had firſt mooued this war: and further, that they thought their Maſters would neuer agree to ſuch conditions, but willingly do any other thing to content the King. They were with vs two daies and afterward returned againe to their campe, whither the Marſhall of Gie, Monſeur <hi>de Piennes</hi> and I, were ſent after them, to demand the ſaid citie of Genua; and as touching Nouarre, we offered to deliuer it to the King of Romans men that were in their campe, vnder the leading of Maſter <hi>George de Pietre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Frederick Capelare,</hi> and one named Maſter <hi>Haunce.</hi> For we could not ſuccour it but by battell, and that we deſired not: wherefore this offer we made to diſcharge our ſelues of it with honor; for the Duchie of Milan is held by homage of the Emperor. Diuers meſſengers ran to and fro betweene our campe and theirs, but nothing was concluded. Notwithſtanding I lodged euery night in their campe; for the Kings pleaſure was that I ſhould ſo do, bicauſe he would breake off no ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In the end all we aboue named returned againe to them, being accompanied with the Preſident of Gannay, and <hi>Moruillier</hi> Bailife of Amiens, which two went with vs to pen the articles in Latin; for hitherto I had negotiated with them in ſuch bad Italian as I had. Our order of proceeding was this. When we arriued at the Dukes lodging, he and the Ducheſſe came foorth to receiue vs at the end of a galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and then we entred all before him into his chamber, where we found two long ranks of chaires, ſet neere togither the one before the other; in the one of the which they ſate downe, and we in the other. They ſate in this order; firſt one for the King of Romanes, then the ambaſſador of Spaine, then the Marqueſſe of Mantua, and the two Prouiſors of Venice, and an ambaſſador of Venice, then the Duke of Milan and his wife, and laſt of all the ambaſſador of Ferrara: of their ſide none ſpake but the Duke alone, and of our ſide but one. But our maner is not to proceede ſo calmly nor ſo orderly as they: for we ſpake ſomtimes two or three togither; but then the Duke vſed to reclaime vs, ſaying ho, one to one. When we came to pen our articles, all that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7649:184"/>
was agreed vpon, was written by one of our Secretaries, and likewiſe by one of theirs, which alſo at our departure the two Secretaries read, the one in Italian and the other in French, and likewiſe at our next meeting, as wel to the end that nothing ſhould be altered, as alſo for the more expedition: and ſure it is a good maner of proceeding in great and waightie affaires. This treatie endured about fifteen daies or more: but it was agreed the firſt day, that the Duke of Orleans might depart out of the towne, and the ſelfeſame day we made truce, which continued from day to day till the peace was concluded. Moreouer, the Marqueſſe of Mantua put himſelfe in hoſtage into the Earle of Foix his hands, rather for his owne pleaſure, than for any doubt we had of the Duke of Orleans perſon. But they made vs firſt ſweare that we would proceed in the treatie of peace vprightly and ſincerely without diſſimulation, onely to deliuer the ſaid Duke.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Marſhall of Gie accompanied with certaine of the Duke of Milans ſeruants, went to Nouarre, and cauſed the Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans with a ſmall traine to come foorth of the towne, whereof he was right glad. They within the towne were ſo miſerably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with famine and ſicknes, that the ſaid Marſhall was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leaue his nephew called Monſeur <hi>de Romefort</hi> in hoſtage with them, promiſing that within three daies they ſhould all come foorth. You haue heard already how the Bailife of Digeon was ſent into Swiſſerland to leauy fiue thouſand men among their Cantons, the which were not yet arriued when the D. of Orleans came forth of Nouarre: for if they had, vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly in mine opinion we had fought. But notwithſtanding that we were certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduertiſed that there came a much greater number than we ſent for: yet could we not tarie their comming bicauſe of our mens great diſtreſſe in Nouarre, where there died at the leaſt two thouſand of famine and ſicknes: the reſt alſo being ſo poore and miſerable that they ſeemed rather dead carcaſſes than liuing creatures. And I
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:7649:185"/>
thinke verily (ſetting the ſiege of Hieruſalem aſide) that neuer men ſuſtained ſuch hunger as they did. But if at their firſt entrie into the towne they had made good prouiſion of Corne, (whereof the might haue recouered plentie in the villages there about) they ſhould neuer haue beene brought to ſuch extremitie: but on the other ſide, their enimies haue been forced to depart with great diſhonor.</p>
               <p>Three or fower daies after the Duke of Orleans departure out of Nouarre, it was agreed by both the parties that all the ſouldiers ſhould likewiſe be permitted to come foorth, and the Marques of Mantua, and Maſter <hi>Galeas</hi> of Saint Seuerin, Captaines, the one of the Venetians, the other of the Duke of Milans forces, were appointed to conueigh them in ſafetie, and ſo they did. Further, as touching the towne of Nouarre it was put into the citizens hands, who were ſworne to receiue into it neither French nor Italian, before the treatie of peace were fully concluded. Moreouer, thirtie of our men remained ſtill in the caſtell, whom the Duke of Milan permitted to haue victuals for their money from day to day. Vndoubtedly a man would neuer beleeue the great miſerie they were in that came foorth of the towne, vnleſſe he had ſeene them. Horſes they brought foorth but fewe, for they were in maner all eaten, and there were hardly ſixe hundred men among them able to do ſeruice, notwithſtanding that there came foorth 5500. A great number lay by the waies whom the enimies themſelues releeued. I for my part for the value of a crowne ſaued fiftie of them, as they lay ſuccourleſſe in a garden neere to a little ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle that the enimies held called Camarian, where I cauſed porrige to be giuen them, which ſo well refreſhed them that in the ſaid garden there died but one, and afterward vpon the way about fower, for it was ten miles from Nouarre to Verceil; whither when they arriued, the King beſtowed his charity vpon them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded eight hundred francks to be deuided among them, and paide them alſo their wages, as well the dead as the liuing, and the Swiſſers in like maner, of whom about fower hundred died in Nouarre: but notwithſtanding all this their good chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing three hundred of them died at Verceil after their returne, ſome by feeding too greedily after their long famine, and ſome by ſicknes, ſo that a great number lay dead vpon the dunghils of the towne. About this preſent, after all our men were come foorth of the towne, except thirty that remained in the caſtle: (ſome of the which alſo daily ſallied foorth) arriued the Swiſſers, eight or ten thouſand of the which came and lodged with vs in our campe, where were already two thouſand that had beene with the King in this voiage of Naples: the reſt of their company being to the number of ten thouſand encamped neere to Verceil. The King was aduiſed not to ſuffer theſe two bands to ioine togither, in the which were to the number of twentie and two thouſand men: ſo that I thinke ſo many ſoldiers of their countrey were neuer togither before. For the opinion of all thoſe that knew their countrey was, that they left but few able men behinde them, &amp; ſure the greateſt part of theſe came whether we would or not, in ſuch ſort that their wiues and children would haue come with them, had not the ſtraights at the entrie into Piemont been defended to ſtop them. A man may doubt whether this their comming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded of good affection or no, bicauſe the late King <hi>Lewis</hi> had beſtowed great benefits vpon them, and was the cauſe of the great honor and renowne they haue won in the world. True it is that there were ſome old men among them, that had borne great good will to King <hi>Lewis:</hi> for there came a number of Captaines aboue ſeauentie two yeeres of age, the which had ſerued againſt Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but the chiefe cauſe of their comming was couuetouſnes and pouertie. To ſay the truth all the able men that they could leuie came, and ſuch a number of tall
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:7649:185"/>
fellowes they were, and ſo goodly a bande, that me thought it impoſſible to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite them, otherwiſe than by famine or cold, or ſome ſuch diſtreſſe.</p>
               <p>Let vs now returne to the principall matter, to wit the treatie. The Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans (after he had well refreſhed himſelfe eight or ten daies, being accompanied with men of all ſorts) ſuppoſing his honor to be ſtained, bicauſe ſuch a number of men as were with him in Nouarre, had ſuffered themſelues through meere folly to be brought to ſo great extremitie, began to wiſh that we might fight, and talked ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſtoutly of the battell, and one or two more of his followers. Further, Monſeur <hi>de Ligny,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of Rouen (who gouerned the ſaid Dukes affaires) and two or three other meane perſonages, ſuborned certaine Swiſſers to come and offer themſelues to fight. But no reaſon could be alleaged why we ſhould ſo do: for the Duke of Orleans had no men in the towne more than the thirty remaining in the caſtle, ſo that there was no cauſe why we ſhould aduenture the battell; for the King had no quarrell, neither meant to fight but onely for ſauing the ſaid Dukes perſon and his ſeruants. Beſides this, our enimies were mightie, and it was impoſſible to aſſaile them in their campe, as well bicauſe they were entrenched round about, and their trenches full of water, as alſo bicauſe of the ſtrong ſeat thereof. Moreouer, they had no enimies to inuade them but vs onely, for they ſtood now in no more feare of the towne. They were aboue 2800. men of armes barded, and fiue thouſand light horſemen, and 11500. Almaines led by good captaines, to wit, Maſter <hi>George</hi> of Pietreplane, Maſter <hi>Frederick Capelare,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Haunce,</hi> beſides great force of footemen of their owne countries; ſo that they ſeemed to ſpeake but vpon a brauery, that ſaid we might take them in their campe, or that they would flie. Beſides all this, another thing there was greatly to be feared, to wit, leaſt theſe Swiſſers if they ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all togither, ſhould take the King and the noble men of the armie, being but a handfull in reſpect of them, and leade them priſoners into their countrie; for ſome apparance there was that they meant ſo to do, as you ſhall heare at the concluſion of the peace.</p>

The articles of the peace were theſe. That the Duke of Milan ſhould beare the King his faith for Genua
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:7649:186"/>
againſt all men: and that in reſpect thereof, he ſhould arme two ſhips to the ſea at his owne proper coſts and charges, to ſuccour the caſtels of Naples which held yet for the King. And further, that the next yeere he ſhould furniſh the King of three ſhips, and ſerue him in perſon in the conqueſt of the ſaid realme, if the King himſelfe happened to returne to conquer it againe. That he ſhould giue paſſage to the Kings forces. And if the Venetians would not accept the peace within two moneths, but continue to defend the houſe of Arragon; that then he ſhould take part with the King againſt them, and imploy his perſon and ſubiects for the Kings ſeruice, vnder this condition, that all that ſhould be conquered of their dominions ſhould be his. That he ſhould releaſe to the King fowerſcore thouſand ducats of the hundred and fower and twenty thouſand that he had lent him in this voiage. That for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe conditions, he ſhould deliuer to the King two hoſtages of Genua. That the caſtell of Genua ſhould be put into the Duke of Ferraraes hands, as neuter for two yeeres, and that the Duke of Milan ſhould pay the one halfe of the garriſon within it, and the King the other: and further, if the ſaid Duke of Milan ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do ſuch ſeruices to the King for Genua, as he was bound to do by this treatie; that then it ſhould be lawfull for the Duke of Ferrara to put the ſaid caſtell into the Kings hands. Laſt of all, that the ſaid Duke of Milan ſhould deliuer to the King two other hoſtages of Milan. Theſe he deliuered, and ſo would he alſo the others of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua, if the King had not departed ſo ſuddenly; but ſo ſoone as he ſawe him gone, he made delaies.</p>
               <p>After we were returned from the enimies campe, and had aduertiſed the King that the Duke of Milan had ſworne the treatie, and the Venetians taken two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths reſpit to accept or refuſe it (for more they would not condeſcend vnto) the King ſware it alſo, and the ſecond day after determined to depart, being very deſirous both he and all the companie to returne into Fraunce: but the ſelfeſame night the Swiſſers that were in our campe aſſembled togither each Canton apart, and ſtrake vp their drums, ſtanding in order of battell by their enſignes, as their maner is in their conſultations. All the which I write vpon the report of <hi>Lornay,</hi> who was then, and long time before had been one of their captaines, and vnderſtandeth well their language, and lodged that night in their campe, and came and aduertiſed the King of all theſe their actions.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe Swiſſers gaue aduiſe to take the King and all his companie, that is to ſay, the principall of the armie; others would not agree thereunto, but gaue counſell to demaund paiment for three moneths, ſaying, that the King his father had promiſed them this paiment as often as they ſhould depart out of their countrie with enſigne diſplaied: others were of opinion to take the principall of the armie, not touching the Kings perſon. This laſt opinion tooke place, ſo far foorth that they began to diſpoſe themſelues to execute it, a great number of their men being already within the towne: but before they had fully concluded, the King departed and went to Trin, a towne in the Marquiſat of Montferrat. Sure they did vs great wrong, to demaund three months paiment (wheras K. <hi>Lewis</hi> had promiſed them but one;) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hauing done no ſeruice. To be ſhort, in the end we made an agreement with them, but they that had been with vs at Naples, had firſt taken the Bailife of Digeon &amp; <hi>Lornay</hi> (who had euer been their captaines) demaunding paiment of 15. daies for their departure. But the others had three moneths pay, amounting to fiue hundred thouſand franks; for the which ſumme, they were contented to take pledges and hoſtages. All this diſorder happened by practiſe of certaine of our owne men, who mooued them thus to do, bicauſe they miſliked the peace, as one of their captaines

But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that many fooliſh words were indeede ſpoken, I know not by whom; yet ſure I am that at this preſent the King greatly deſired his friendſhip.

Laſtly, to declare King <hi>Ferrande</hi> to be none of their confederates, bicauſe none were comprehended in their league but the Pope, the King of Romans, the King of Spaine, and the Duke of Milan. When I arriued at Venice, they receiued me very honorably, though not ſo honorably as at my former being there, and no maruell; for then we were in peace, but now in hoſtilitie. I did my meſſage to the Duke, who welcommed me, and told me that ſhortly I ſhould receiue mine anſwer, but that he would firſt conſult with the Senate. Three daies they commanded generall proceſſions and publike ſermons, and dealt great almes, deſiring God of his grace to direct them into the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt courſe; which maner of proceeding (as I was there informed) they vſe ordinarily in ſuch like caſes. Wherefore I muſt needes confeſſe, that this citie ſeemed to me the moſt deuout, as touching matters of religion, that euer I came in, and their Churches the beſt decked and trimmed; ſo that heerin I account them equall with the ancient Romanes, and amfully perſwaded, that thereof ſpringeth the greatnes of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niorie:
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7649:187"/>
which ſure is woorthie rather to increaſe than diminiſh. But to returne to mine ambaſſage, I abode there fifteene daies before I was diſpatched. The anſwer I receiued was a refuſall of all my demaunds, with this excuſe that they were not in war with the King, neither had done any thing but in defence of their confederate the Duke of Milan, whom the King ſought to deſtroy. Afterward they cauſed the Duke to commune with me apart, who offered me a good compoſition, to wit, that King <hi>Ferrande</hi> by the Popes conſent ſhould hold the realme of Naples of the King by homage, and pay him yeerely fiftie thouſand ducats for tribute, and a certaine ſumme of monie preſently, the which they offered to lend, meaning to haue in gage for it the places which they now hold in Pouille, namely Brandis, Otrante, Trani, and the reſt. And further, that for performance of theſe conditions, the ſaid Dom <hi>Ferrande</hi> ſhould deliuer to the King, or leaue in his hands certaine towns in Pouille, they meant Tarente which the King yet held, and one or two more that the ſaid <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rande</hi> ſhould haue deliuered, which townes they offered vs on that ſide of Italie, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the furtheſt from vs, notwithſtanding that they pretended the offer to be, bicauſe they ſtood commodiouſly to inuade the Turke: whereof the King had put men in great hope at his firſt entrie into Italie, ſaying, that he attempted this conqueſt of Naples, to the end he might with the more expedition tranſport his forces againſt the ſaid Turke, which was a wicked deuice, and a meere lie; for he meant nothing leſſe, but from God no man can hide his thoughts. Moreouer, the Duke of Venice offered me, that if the King would attempt any thing againſt the Turke, he ſhould haue free acceſſe to theſe places aboue named, that all Italy ſhould be contributors to the wars; that the King of Romanes ſhould inuade alſo on the other ſide, and that the King and they would gouerne Italie in ſuch ſort, that no man ſhould refuſe to pay that he ſhould be rated at; and further, that they for their part would aide him vpon their owne proper coſts and charges with an hundred gallies vpon the ſea, and fiue thouſand horſes vpon the land.</p>
               <p>I tooke my leaue of the Duke and the Seniorie, ſaying, that I would make report of their anſwer to the King. Then returned I to Milan, and found the Duke at Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſue, and the Kings ambaſſador with him, who was one of the Stewards of his houſe named <hi>Rigaut Dorelles.</hi> The Duke came foorth himſelfe to meete me, vnder colour of going a hunting: for they vſe there to receiue ambaſſadors with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and lodged me in his caſtle very honorably. I deſired to commune with him apart, and he promiſed that I ſhould ſo do, though halfe againſt his will as it ſeemed. The caſtle of Naples held yet for the King: wherefore I meant earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preſſe him for the two ſhips promiſed vs by the treatie of Verceil, the which were readie to depart, he in outward apparance ſeeming-willing thereunto: But <hi>Peron</hi> of Baſche Steward of the Kings houſe, and <hi>Stephen de Neues</hi> (who were at Genua for the King) ſo ſoone as they vnderſtood of my arriuall at Vigeſue, wrote vnto me, complaining of the Duke of Milans falſhood, who would not ſuffer the two ſhips to depart which he had promiſed vs, but on the contrary ſide had ſent two to aide our enimies. They aduertiſed me further, that one day the gouernor of Genua made them anſwere that he would not ſuffer the ſaide ſhips to be manned with any French men, and another day that he would put into each of them but fiue and twentie at the moſt, with diuers ſuch like diſſimulations, dalliyng and delaying the time till the caſtle of Naples were yeelded, which the Duke knew well to be vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualled but for a moneth or little more. And as touching the armie that the King leuied in Prouence, it was not able to ſuccour the caſtle without theſe two ſhips: for the enimies lay before it with a great Nauie, as well of their owne, as of the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7649:187"/>
Venetians, and the King of Spaines. Three daies I abode with the Duke, and one day he ſate in counſell with me, ſeeming to be diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented that I miſliked his anſwer touching the ſaid ſhips, and alleaged that by the treatie of Verceil he had promiſed to ſerue the King with two ſhips, but not that they ſhould be manned with French men. Whereunto I anſwered that this ſeemed to me a verie ſlender excuſe: for if he ſhould lend me a good mule to paſſe the mountaines withall, and afterward make me lead hir in my hand and not to ride vpon hir, but looke vpon hir onely, what pleaſure did he me? After much debating, he and I withdrew our ſelues into a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, where I declared vnto him what great paines, both I and others had taken to conclude this treatie of Verceil, and into how great danger he brought vs by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariyng thus his promiſe, and cauſing the King by that meanes to loſe theſe caſtles, and conſequently the whole realme, whereby he ſhould alſo ingender perpetuall hatred between the King and him. Further, I offered him the Princedome of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente and the Duchie of Bary, the which Duchie he held already. Laſtly, I ſhewed him the danger he put both himſelfe and the whole eſtate of Italy into, by ſuffering the Venetians to hold theſe places in Pouille <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP12.NOTE2">

                  </ref>. And he confeſſed I ſaid true, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially touching the Venetians: but his laſt reſolution was that he could finde no faith nor aſſurance with the King.</p>
               <p>After this communication I tooke my leaue of him, he accompaning me vpon the way about a league. But euen at our very departure he deuiſed yet a cunningerly than all the reſt (if a man may vſe ſuch termes of a Prince,) for bicauſe I ſeemed to depart ſad and Melancholick: he ſaid vnto me (as a man ſuddenly altered) that he would do me a friendly turne to the end the King might haue good cauſe to welcom me: for the next day he would ſend Maſter <hi>Galeas</hi> to Genua (more I could not wiſh when he named him to me) to cauſe the two ſhips to depart, and ioine with our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, by meanes whereof he would ſaue the King the caſtle of Naples, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the whole realme, as he ſhould indeed if he had done as he promiſed. He ſaid further, that immediately after their departure he would aduertiſe me thereof with his owne hand, to the end I might be the firſt man that ſhould bring newes to the King, of this great ſeruice that I had done him, adding alſo that the Courrier ſhould ouertake me with his letters before my arriuall at Lyons. In this good hope departed I and tooke my iourney to paſſe the mountaines, thinking euerie Poſte that came after me to be the ſame that ſhould haue brought me theſe letters. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I doubted ſomewhat thereof, knowing the nature of the man ſo well as I did. But to proceed in my voiage, I came to Chambery where I found the Duke of Sauoy who honorably entreated me, and ſtaied me with him a day. Afterward I arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at Lyons (without my Courrier) to make report to the King of all that I had done, whom I found banketting and iuſting, and wholy giuen to ſport and paſtime. Thoſe that had miſliked this treatie of Verceil were glad that the Duke of Milan had thus deluded vs: for their credit increaſed thereby, but me they potted at, as in ſuch caſes is vſuall in Princes courts, greatly to my griefe and diſcontentment.</p>
               <p>I made report to the King by mouth, and ſhewed him alſo in writing the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans offers aboue rehearſed, whereof he made ſmall account, and the Cardinall who gouerned all, much leſſe. But that notwithſtanding I mooued it to him afterward againe: for me thought it better to accept this offer then to loſe all. Beſides that, the King had no men about him able to deale in ſo waightie an enterpriſe <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP12.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>: for thoſe that were able and of experience, they that had all the credit neuer or very ſeldome called to counſell in any matter. The King would gladly they ſhould oftner haue beene called, but he feared to diſpleaſe thoſe that were of authority about
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7649:188"/>
him, eſpecially thoſe that gouerned his treaſure, namely the ſaid Cardinall and his brethren and kinſmen. Wherefore let all other Princes learne by the example of this, how fit and conuenient it is for themſelues to take paines in the gouerning of their owne affaires; at the leaſt ſometimes, how requiſite it is to call more than one or two to counſell, according to the varietie of the matters that are debated; and how neceſſarie it is to hold their counſellors almoſt in equall authority: for if one of them be ſo great, that the reſt feare him (as one was both then and euer ſince about King <hi>Charles)</hi> he is King and Lord in effect, and the Prince himſelfe is euill ſerued, as this King was by his gouernors, who ſought onely their owne profit and little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded his, whereby himſelfe was the leſſe eſteemed and the worſe thought of.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Returned to Lyons the yeere 1495. the twelfe of December, where the King was already arriued with his army a yeere and two moneths after his departure out of his realme. The caſtles of Naples held yet for him as before you haue heard, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeur <hi>de Montpenſier</hi> his lieutenant there, was yet at Salerne in the realme of Naples with the Prince of Salerne: likewiſe Monſeur <hi>de Aubigny</hi> was yet in Calabria where he had done great ſeruice: notwithſtanding that he had been ſicke almoſt euer ſince the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.

Beſides that, they could hardly receiue any newes or letters out of Fraunce, and thoſe few they did receiue, were but lies and faire promiſes without effect. For the K. as you haue heard they diſpatched nothing himſelfe: and if it had beene furniſhed in time but of the ſixte part of the money that was ſpent afterward, they had neuer loſt the realme. But in the end when all was yeelded, they receiued forty thouſand ducats onely, for part of a yeeres pay already paſſed: and yet if this ſmall ſumme had come but a moneth ſooner, the miſeries and diuiſions they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fell into, and the diſhonor they receiued, had neuer chanced. All the which inconueniences hapned bicauſe the King diſpatched nothing himſelfe, neither would giue the meſſengers audience that came from them. And as touching his ſeruants to whom he committed the gouernment of his affaires: they were men of ſmall experience, idle, and negligent, and ſome of them I thinke had intelligence with the Pope, whereby it manifeſtly appeered, that God had now altogither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen his grace from the King, which at his going to Naples he had poured down ſo plentifully vpon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:7649:188"/>
After the King had ſoiourned at Lyons about two monethes, word was brought him that the Daulphin his ſonne lay at the point of death, and within three daies after that he was dead, which newes he tooke heauily as nature would: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his ſorrow ſoone ended. But the Queene of Fraunce and Ducheſſe of Britaine called <hi>Anne,</hi> lamented the death of hir ſonne, and that a long time, as much as was poſſible for a woman to do. And I thinke verily that beſides the naturall griefe that women vſe to conceiue in ſuch caſes, hir minde gaue hir that ſome greater euill hung ouer hir head. The King hir husband (as I haue ſaid) mourned not long, but ſought to comfort hir, by cauſing certaine yoong gentlemen to daunce before hir, of the which the Duke of Orleans was one, being of the age of fower and thirty yeeres, who ſeemed to reioice at the Daulphins death, bicauſe he was heire appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the crowne next after the King: for the which cauſe the K. and he ſaw not one another in a long time after. The Daulphin was about three yeeres olde, a goodly childe, bold in ſpeech, and no whit fearing thoſe things that commonly children vſe to feare. Wherefore (to be plaine with you) his fathers ſorrow ſoone ended: for he began already to doubt if this childe grew to yeeres, and continued in his noble conditions, that happily he might diminiſh his eſtimation and authoritie: for the King himſelfe was a man of very ſmall ſtature and no great ſenſe, but of ſo good a nature, that it was impoſſible to finde a gentler creature.</p>
               <p>Heerby you may perceiue in how miſerable eſtate Kings and Princes liue, who ſtand in feare of their owne children. King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth who was ſo wiſe and vertuous a Prince, ſtood in feare of this King <hi>Charles</hi> his ſonne, but he prouided well for it, and afterward died, leauing his ſaid ſonne King, being but fowerteene yeeres of age. The ſaid King <hi>Lewis</hi> alſo had put King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuen his father in feare of him: for being but thirteene yeeres of age, he mooued war againſt him with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine noble men and gentlemen of the realme, that miſliked thoſe that bare the ſway in Court, &amp; gouerned the eſtate, as K. <hi>Lewis</hi> himſelfe hath eftſoones told me: but this broile ſoone ended. Afterward alſo being come to mans eſtate, he fell at great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his father, and retired himſelfe into Daulphine, and from thence into Flaunders, leauing the countrie of Daulphin to the ſaid King his father, as I haue made mention about the beginning of this hiſtorie written of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. Wherefore it is manifeſt that no creature is exempt from trouble, but that all men eate their bread in trauell and ſorrow, as God promiſed vs that we ſhould ſoone after he had created man, the which promiſe he hath truly performed to all ſorts of men. But great diuerſitie there is of troubles and ſorrowes: for thoſe of the bodie are the leſſe, and thoſe of the minde the greater: the ſorrowes of wiſe men are of one ſort, and the ſorrowes of fooles of another; but much greater griefe and paſſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth the foole than the wiſe man, and leſſe comfort receiueth he in his ſorrowes, though many ſuppoſe otherwiſe. The poore man that trauelleth and toileth his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to get foode to ſuſtaine himſelfe and his children, and paieth cuſtoms and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to his Prince, ſhould liue in too great deſcomfort and deſpaire, if Princes and great men had nothing but pleaſure in this world, and he nothing on the contrarie ſide but trauell and miſerie. But God hath otherwiſe diſpoſed thereof; for if I ſhould take vpon me to rehearſe the ſundrie griefes, ſorrowes, and paſſions that I haue ſeene diuers great perſonages ſuſtaine, as well men as women within theſe thirty yeeres onely, a great volume would hardly containe them.

their ſorrowes and griefes ariſe of ſo ſmall occaſions, that they that were vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them would hardly beleeue it, the moſt part being grounded vpon ielouſies and reports, which is a diſeaſe that lurketh ſecretly in great Princes Courts, and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with it infinite miſchiefs both to their owne perſons, their ſeruants, and all their ſubiects, and ſo much ſhorteneth their liues, that hardly any King of Fraunce ſince <hi>Charles</hi> the great hath paſſed the age of ſixtie yeeres. For the which cauſe, when King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth approched neere to that age (being ſicke of this diſeaſe) he accounted himſelfe a dead man. His father King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth, who had done ſo many noble acts in Fraunce, conceiued an imagination in his ſicknes, that his ſeruants went about to poiſon him, and therefore refuſed to receiue ſuſtenance. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his father King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt was troubled with ſo many ſuſpicions, that he loſt his wits, and all by reports. And ſure this is a fault greatly to be blamed in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that in theſe caſes they cauſe not ſuch matters as concerne themſelues (be they of neuer ſo ſmall importance) to be ripped vp: which if they did, they ſhould not ſo often be troubled with falſe tales. For if they would examine the parties the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other, I meane the accuſer, and him that is accuſed, no man durſt report any thing to them that were vntrue. But ſome Princes there are of ſo doltiſh diſpoſition, that they will promiſe and ſweare to the accuſers neuer to diſcloſe their reports, whereby they are often troubled with theſe anguiſhes before mentioned, and hate and iniurie their truſtieſt and faithfulleſt ſeruants and ſubiects, at the pleaſure and vpon the complaint many times of lewd and naughtie perſons.</p>

But King <hi>Ferrande</hi> ſonne of King <hi>Alphonſe,</hi> who was entred into religion (as before you haue heard) accompanied with the Marqueſſe of Mantua, brother to the ſaid <hi>Montpenſiers</hi> wife, and Generall of the Venetians, marched againſt them. They found the ſaide <hi>Montpenſier</hi> lodged in a towne called Atelle, a place very commodious for their prouiſion of victuals, and ſeated on a hill, vpon the which our enimies fortified their campe as men fearing the battell, bicauſe the ſaid King <hi>Ferrand</hi> and his forces had been diſcomfited in all places, as was alſo the Marques of Mantua at Fornoua where we fought with him. The ſaid Marques the Venetians had lent to K. <hi>Ferrand</hi> with a certaine ſumme of money, but of ſmall value in reſpect of the places they had in gage for it, which were theſe ſixe townes in Pouille of great importance, Brandis, Trani, Galipoli, Crana, Otrante, and Monopoly, the laſt of the which ſince the Kings departure they had woon from vs. Moreouer in the ſaid ſumme of money they comprehended the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their ſoldiers that ſerued the ſaid <hi>Ferrand,</hi> ſo that they hold theſe places for two hundred thouſand ducats; yea, and now they require the charges they haue been at in the fortification and defence of them, ſo that I am fully perſwaded they minde neuer to reſtore them: for they vſe not ſo to do, when towns lie commodiouſly for them, as theſe do, being ſcituate vpon the Adriatike gulfe, ſo that by meanes of them they are Lords of the ſaid gulfe, which is one of the things they chiefely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; and no maruell, for it is from Otrante (which is the verie point of the ſaid gulfe) to Venice at the leaſt nine hundred miles. And notwithſtanding that the Pope held certaine places alſo vpon the ſaid gulfe intermingled among theſe Venetian townes: yet were all paſſengers forced to paie cuſtome to Venice: wherefore the poſſeſſion of theſe places is more beneficiall to them than the world weeneth: for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

yeerely from thence great plenty of corne and oile, which are two neceſſarie things for their prouiſion.</p>
               <p>At the ſaid place of Atelle aboue mentioned, our men fell at variance as well for their victuals which began now to diminiſh, as alſo for their paie, the ſoldiers were vnpaid for eighteene moneths and more, by meanes wherof they had liued in great miſerie. To the Almains alſo much was due, but not ſo much: for all the money that Monſeur <hi>de Montpenſier</hi> could leuy in the realme was paied to them, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were vnpaid for a yeere and more, but they had ſpoiled diuers ſmall townes whereby they were maruellouſly enriched. If the fortie thouſand ducats promiſed them had been ſent in time, or if they had knowne they ſhould haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them at Florence, this variance had neuer hapned, but now they remained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither in deſpaire: diuers of our captaines haue enformed me that if our men would haue agreed to fight, they were like enough to haue obteined the victory: and if they had been diſcomfited, yet ſhould not their loſſe haue been ſo great, as by the ſhamefull compoſition they made. <hi>Montpenſier</hi> and <hi>Virgile Vrſin,</hi> who were the beſt men of war among them would haue fought, and euill hap it was to them that they did not: for King <hi>Ferrand</hi> brake the compoſition, and put them both in priſon, where they miſerablie ended their liues. They laid the blame that they fought not vpon Monſeur <hi>de Perſi</hi> a yoong gentleman of Auuergne, whom they accuſed as a mutinous knight, and diſobedient to his captaine. You ſhall vnderſtand that in this armie were two ſorts of Almaines, the firſt were Swiſſers to the number of fifteene hundred, whom the King left there at his departure from Naples, the which ſerued faithfully euen til the hower of death, ſo that it was impoſſible for men to ſerue more valiantly than they did. The other ſort were thoſe whom we call commonly Launce knights (that is to ſay, ſeruants of the countrie) the which hate naturally the Swiſſers. They are of all parts of Germanie, as for example, of the countries lying vpon the Rhine, and of Swobland, ſome there were alſo of the countrie of Vaulx in Seno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP14.NOTE7">

Theſe were to the number of eight hundred newly ſent thither with two moneths pay, the which being ſpent before they came thither, and at their arriuall there no new pay being found: they ſeeing themſelues in this diſtreſſe, declared that they bare vs no ſuch good will as the Swiſſers do; for they practiſed with our enimies, and turned to King <hi>Ferrande,</hi> for the which cauſe partly, and partly for the diuiſion that was among our captaines, our men made a ſhamefull appointment with their enimies, the which King <hi>Ferrande</hi> ſware to keepe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, being forced ſo to do by the Marqueſſe of Mantua, who thought thereby to aſſure the perſon of his brother in lawe Monſeur <hi>de Montpenſier,</hi> yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſaid <hi>Ferrande</hi> brake the treatie, as afterward mention ſhall be made more at large.</p>
               <p>By the ſaid compoſition they yeelded both themſelues and all the Kings artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to their enimies, promiſing further, to cauſe to be rendred all the places that the King held in the realme, as well in Calabria where Monſeur <hi>d'Aubigny</hi> was, as in L'Abruzzo where Maſter <hi>Gracian des Guerres</hi> was togither, with the townes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ietta and Tarente; vnder this condition, that King <hi>Ferrande</hi> ſhould ſend them by ſea into Prouence with bag and baggage, which was not much woorth: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the compoſition King <hi>Ferrande</hi> commanded them all to be led to Naples, being to the number of fiue or ſixe thouſand perſons or more. So ſhamefull a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition hath not beene made in our time, neither do I remember that euer I read of the like, ſaue that which the two conſuls of Rome made (as rehearſeth <hi>Titus Liuius</hi>

Their faith and loyaltie was greatly to be commended: for they all choſe rather to die than to ſerue King <hi>Ferrande,</hi> and ſo a number of them died in the ſaid yle of Pruſſe, ſome of heate, ſome of ſicknes, and ſome of famine: for they were held there a long time in their ſhips, in ſuch penurie and lacke of victuals, as is almoſt incredible.

If this miſerie had fallen but vpon them onely that made this compoſition, they had not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>been greatly to be moned. Immediately after King <hi>Ferrande</hi> had receiued this honor aboue mentioned, and married King <hi>Ferrande</hi> his grandfathers daughter, being a yoong maide of thirteene or fowerteene yeeres of age, begotten of the King of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiles ſiſter that now raigneth (ſo that his wife was ſiſter to his owne father King <hi>Alfonſe)</hi> he fell into a continuall ague, whereof ſoone after he died, and the crowne of the realme deſcended to King <hi>Frederick</hi> (the ſaid King <hi>Ferrandes</hi> vncle) now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently raigning.

Moreouer, he was aduertiſed daily of diuers practiſes entertained on his behalfe in Italy, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they were both dangerous and chargeable: yet was he of power ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to haue atchieued them bicauſe his realme is populous, &amp; plentifull of graine in Prouence and Languedoc, and hath alſo a number of other wealthie countries, where money might haue been leuied. But if any other Prince beſides the King of Fraunce ſhould attend to theſe Italian practiſes and aduenture to entermebdle in their enterpriſes, he ſhould but vndoe himſelfe, ſpend his treaſure, and bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to effect. For the Italians neither do nor can ſerue but for money, except it be a Duke of Milan, or one of the greateſt Seniories: but a poore captaine be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo well affectioned to the ſeruice of a King of Fraunce pretending title to the realme of Naples, or the Duchie of Milan, be he neuer ſo faithfull and truſtie, yet ſhal he not be able to do him ſeruice any long time after his paiment faileth, bicauſe his men will forſake him, and the poore captaine ſhall be vtterly vndone: for the greateſt part of them liue onely vpon the credit they win by the ſeruice of their ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors, who are paied by their captaine, and he of him whom he ſerueth, which is the cauſe why they deſire in Italy nothing but factions and ciuile wars. But as touching the practiſes aboue mentioned, you ſhall vnderſtand that they began before the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:7649:191"/>
towne of Caietta was loſt, to wit, immediately after the King perceiued that the Duke of Milan would not performe the conditions of the treatie of Verceil, and continued after the loſſe of the ſaid towne, the whole ſpace of two yeeres after the Kings returne home. As touching the ſaid Duke of Milan, he brake not his promiſe altogither vpon malice and trecherie, but partly for feare: for he doubted that the King would deſtroy him if he obteined the realme of Naples: beſides that, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the King to be a Prince in whom was no conſtancie nor aſſurance. But to proceede, one of theſe enterpriſes aboue mentioned was to inuade the Duchie of Milan after this ſort. Order was giuen that the Duke of Orleans ſhould go to Aſt to enter with a good band of men on that ſide, whom I ſawe once ſo neere his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that his train was already gone. We were ſure of the Duke of Ferrareas friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for he had promiſed to aide vs (notwithſtanding that he were the Duke of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans father in lawe) with fiue hundred men of armes, and two thouſand footemen, which his promiſe vndoubtedly he would haue performed, to the end he might haue rid himſelfe of the danger he was in, lying iuſt in the midſt betweene the Venetians and the ſaid Duke: for not long before (as I haue already made mention) the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had taken from him the Poleſan, and ſought wholy his deſtruction: wherefore he would haue preferred his owne ſafetie and his childrens, before his ſonne in lawes friendſhip; yea, and peraduenture he thought that the Duke of Milan ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in this extremitie would make ſome appointment with the King <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP15.NOTE1">

Theſe mercenary ſoldiers the King ſhould haue paid, but as touching the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines they ſhould haue paid their forces themſelues. The Duke of Ferrara alſo, the Marques of Mantua and Bentiuoille, offered this aide vpon their owne charge, for they hoped to conquer in the Duchie of Milan as much as ſhould counteruaile their coſte. And if the Duke of Milan had been ſuddenly inuaded by the Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans, and all theſe aboue rehearſed at one inſtant, his confederates (namely the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians) could not haue ſuccoured him (though they would haue ſpent all their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his defence) before he muſt haue been forced to reuolt to the K, who would haue kept theſe Italians in the field a long time. And the Duchy of Milan being
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:7649:192"/>
once woon, the realme of Naples would haue yeelded of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The ſtay of this goodly enterpriſe proceeded of the Duke of Orleans, who ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly altered his minde the night before he ſhould haue departed: for he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſent before him all things neceſſarie for his perſon, and none remained to depart but himſelfe onely: for the army was in a readines, their wages paid them, &amp; they all gone before to Aſt, being to the number of eight hundred men of armes French, and ſixe thouſand footemen: among the which were fower hundred Swiſſers. But the ſaid Duke of Orleans being thus ſuddenly altered, beſought the King twice to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this matter againe to his counſell, and ſo he did, I my ſelfe was preſent at the debating of it both the times, and the whole Counſell concluded that he ſhould go, not one man ſpeaking to the contrarie: notwithſtanding that there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at each time ten or twelue Counſellors at the leaſt. And ſure ſo had it beene moſt conuenient, conſidering that we had therof aſſured our friends in Italy aboue named: all the which had beene at great charges, and were in a readines. But the Duke of Orleans being preſent at the debating of this matter himſelfe, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (either by the aduiſe of ſome one, or for that he ſhunned this enterpriſe bicauſe he ſaw the King euill diſpoſed of his body, whoſe heire he ſhould be if he died) that he would neuer take vpon him this voiage for his owne particular quarrell, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly by the Kings commandement as his lieutenant, with the which anſwere the counſell aroſe. The next day and many daies after, the ambaſſadors of Florence and diuers others, preſſed the King earneſtly to command the Duke to depart. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the King anſwered, that he would neuer force him to the wars againſt his will. Thus was this voiage daſhed to the Kings great greefe, both bicauſe of the great charges he had ſuſteined; and alſo bicauſe he was in good hope (if it had proceeded) to haue been reuenged of the Duke of Milan, conſidering what intelligences he had already, and what other intelligences he might haue had at that time; by meanes of Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> of Treuoul, lieutenant generall for him and the D. of Orleans in theſe Italian wars, who was a Milanois borne, and very well beloued and frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his countrie, where he had good intelligence with many both of his kinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others. This enterpriſe thus failing, another ſucceeded, yea two or three at a clap againſt Genua: where the people are euer inclined to diuiſion; one of theſe enterpriſes was managed by Maſter <hi>Baptiſte de Campefourgouſe,</hi> who was chiefe of one of the factions in the towne, but baniſhed, and his faction of no authoritie at that time, neither yet the houſe of Orie, who are gentlemen, and they of Fourgouſi none. The ſaid <hi>D'Ories</hi> take part with the Fourgouſes, but none of them may be Duke, bicauſe they are gentlemen, for no gentlemen may be Duke of Genua: but this <hi>Baptiste</hi> had been Duke not long before, and loſt the gouernment by the treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his vnckle the Cardinall of Genua, who of late yeeres put the Seniorie of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua into the Duke of Milans hands. So that at this preſent the <hi>Adornes</hi> gouerned Genua, who in like maner are not gentlemen, but haue often been Dukes by helpe of the Spinoles who are gentlemen; ſo that the gentlemen make the Duke of Genua, but cannot be Dukes themſelues. This <hi>Baptista</hi> truſted that his faction would ariſe in his fauor, both in the towne and countrey, and that the towne being recouered, the ſoueraigntie thereof ſhould remaine to the King, but he and his faction gouerne and baniſh their enimies. The other enterpriſe was this, diuers of Sauonne addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelues to the Cardinall Saint <hi>Peter ad Vincula</hi> 
                  <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP15.NOTE3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>, and promiſed to yeeld the towne to him, hoping thereby to recouer their libertie; for they are vnder the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuois gouernment, and pay tribute to them. If we had entred into this place, Genua ſhould haue been greatly diſtreſſed, the countrey of Prouence being in ſubiection to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:7649:192"/>
the King, and Sauoy wholy at his deuotion. Wherefore the King being aduertiſed of all theſe enterpriſes, wrote to Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> of Treuoul to aide Maſter <hi>Baptiſt de Campefourgouſe</hi> with force to conueigh him to the gates of Genua, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his faction would ariſe in his fauor. And on the other ſide he was ſo earneſtlie preſſed by the Cardinal S. <hi>Peter ad Vincula,</hi> that he ſent other letters at the ſelfe ſame time to the ſaid M. <hi>Iohn Iames,</hi> comanding him to lend the ſaid Cardinal men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueie him to Sauonne: and the like commandement ſent he him alſo by mouth by the Lord of Sernon in Prouence, who was great friend to the ſaid Cardinall and a ſtout talker. Beſides theſe two commandements, came yet a thirde, which was, that the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> ſhould retire into ſome place where he might conueniently aide both theſe parties aboue mentioned, &amp; yet attempt nothing againſt the Duke of Milan, nor the treatie of peace made the ſummer before with him, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement was cleane contrary to the two former.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how great Princes affaires are gouerned when they vnderſtand them not themſelues, but command letters and diſpatch men vpon a ſudden before they heare matters well debated. For as touching the demaunds of Maſter <hi>Baptiſt de Campeforgouſe</hi> and the ſaid Cardinal, it was impoſſible to ſatisfie them both at once, for <hi>Baptiſt</hi> durſt not go to the wals of Genua without great force, bicauſe the towne is very populous, and the people well armed, and hardy and valiant ſoldiers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> ſhould at the ſame time haue lent men alſo to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, his armie had been diuided into three companies; for part of the force muſt haue remained with himſelfe. In the meane time diuers bands arriued at Genua and at Sauonne, ſent thither by the Duke of Milan and the Venetians, who both feared greatly the reuolt of Genua, as did alſo Dom <hi>Frederick</hi> and the Pope.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe two enterpriſes, the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> had yet a third in his head, deuiſed of his owne braine, which was this, he would haue broken off both theſe other enterpriſes, and haue marched with the whole force ſtraight againſt the Duke of Milan, and vndoubtedly if he had not beene countermaunded, he would haue done ſome great exploit. His enterpriſe he was already entred into, and had aduertiſed the King thereof, pretending that he could not otherwiſe aide them that ſhould go to Genua or Sauonne to the enterpriſes aboue mentioned. Wherefore vnder colour thereof, he led his armie into the high way betweene Alexandria and Genua (which was the onely way the Duke of Milan could ſend to inuade our bands that ſhould go to Genua and Sauonne) and three or fower ſmall townes he tooke, which voluntarily receiued him, aduertiſing the King that this notwithſtanding, he made no war vpon the Duke of Milan, ſeeing he was forced of neceſſitie (for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thoſe that ſhould go to the other enterpriſes) to do as he did: adding, that the King could not be ſaid to make war vpon the Duke of Milan, for ſeeking to conquer Genua or Sauonne, bicauſe they were held of him and forfaited to him; but this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe was daſhed by the Kings commandement. Further, to ſatisfie the Cardinall, the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> lent him part of the armie to conuey him to Sauonne, but he found the place manned, and thereupon gaue ouer his enterpriſe and returned. He lent men alſo to Maſter <hi>Baptiſt</hi> to conuey him to Genua, who aſſured him that his enterpriſe ſhould take effect: but when he was three or fower leagues vpon the way, they that accompanied him began to be ielous of him, as well the Almaines as the French, wherein notwithſtanding that they did him wrong, yet ſure their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie being but ſmall, ſhould haue put themſelues in great danger, if they had gone to Genua, and his faction had not happened to ariſe. Thus all theſe enterpriſes ſped euill, and the Duke of Milan, who had been greatly diſtreſſed, if Maſter <hi>Iohn Iames</hi>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:7649:193"/>
had beene ſuffered to inuade him with the whole force, was now ſtrong; for the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians had ſent diuers bands to his aide. Whereupon our armie retired, our foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were diſmiſſed, and theſe little townes that were taken abandoned: and thus ended theſe wars, finally to the Kings profit, who conſumed infinite treaſure in them.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat happened from the Kings returne out of Italie (which was about 3. or 4. moneths before the end of the yeer 1495.) till the beginning of the yeere 1498. I haue already rehearſed: for all that ſpace I was reſident in the Court, and preſent at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of moſt part of thoſe affaires. The King rode about from Lyons to Moulins, and from Moulins to Tours, holding tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neies and iuſts in all places, and minding nothing elſe. Thoſe that were of the greateſt authoritie about him, were ſo diuided, that more they could not be; for ſome of them would that the conqueſt of Naples ſhould ſtill continue, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their profit and credit depended thereupon, namely, the Cardinall <hi rend="sup">1</hi>, and the Seneſchall <hi rend="sup">2</hi>, who gouerned all the Kings affaires: on the otherſide the Admirall, who before this voiage had borne all the ſway with the yoong King, would in any wiſe that theſe Italian enterpriſes ſhould ceaſe, and trauelled to ouerthrowe them, knowing that the quailing of them would turne greatly to his profite, and be a meanes whereby he might recouer his former credit and authoritie, and the others fall into diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Thus paſſed the Kings affaires about a yeere and a halfe, during the which ſpace he ſent ambaſſadors to the King and Queene of Caſtile, who were in war with him, and whoſe friendſhip he greatly deſired, bicauſe they were mightie both by ſea and land. And notwithſtanding that they did no great exploit vpon the land, yet had they ſent great aide by ſea to King <hi>Ferrande</hi> and King <hi>Frederick</hi> of Naples: for the yle of Sicilie is diſtant from Reges in Calabria but a league and a halfe, ſo that ſome hold opinion it was once firme land with Italie <hi rend="sup">3</hi>, and that the ſea breaking in, made this ſtraight <hi rend="sup">4</hi> now named the Far <hi rend="sup">5</hi> of Meſſine. The ſaid yle of Sicilie was then and yet is, in ſubiection to the King and Queene of Caſtile, who ſent from thence great aide to Naples, as well of great ſhips called Carauels that came out of Spaine, as alſo of men. Moreouer, in the yle of Sicilie itſelfe a companie of men of armes was leuied, the which paſſed into Calabria with a certaine number of genetarios <hi rend="sup">6</hi>, and made war vpon the Kings forces there. Beſides this, their ſhips were continually with the confederates nauie, by means whereof, when all their forces were togither, the King was much too weake for his enimies vpon the ſea, but otherwiſe the King of Caſtile endammaged him not much. True it is that once a great companie of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:7649:193"/>
horſemen entred into Languedock, and ſpoiled the countrie, and lodged in it three or fower daies; but other exploit did they none. Then the Lord of Saint André in Bourbonnois, who defended thoſe frontiers for the Duke of Bourbon the Kings lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in Languedock, attempted to take Sauſſes a little towne in the countrie of Rouſſillon, bicauſe on that ſide they had inuaded the Kings dominions about two yeeres before. For you ſhall vnderſtand, that the King had reſtored vnto them the ſaid countrie of Rouſſillon <hi rend="sup">7</hi>, whereof the territorie of Parpignan is parcell, in the which this little towne of Sauſſes is ſituate. His enterpriſe was great and dangerous; for the towne was well manned though it were but ſmall, and a great number of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the King of Caſtiles houſe were within it; beſides that, their armie being ſtronger than ours lay abrode in the fields encamped within a league of the place: yet notwithſtanding the ſaid Lord of Saint André ſo wiſely and cloſely guided his enterpriſe that within ten howers he tooke the towne by aſſault, as my ſelfe can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and at the breach were ſlaine thirtie or fortie Spaniſh gentlemen of marke, among whom was the Archbiſhop of Saint Iames his ſonne, beſides three or fower hundred common ſoldiers. They thought not that the towne could haue been taken ſo ſuddenly; for they vnderſtood not the feate of our artillerie, which vndoubtedly is the beſt in the world.</p>
               <p>This is all the exploit that was done between theſe two Princes, whereof though the effects were but ſmall yet great was the ſhame and diſhonor the King of Caſtile receiued thereby, his armie being ſo ſtrong as it was: but where God is diſpoſed to puniſh, commonly ſuch ſmall ſcoruges run before. For the ſaid King and Queen of Caſtile were ſhortly after otherwiſe puniſhed, and ſo were we alſo. But ſure as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them they much ſtained their honor in violating their othe giuen to the King, who had dealt ſo bountifully with them, by reſtoring them the countrey of Rouſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, the fortification and defence whereof had beene ſo chargeable to his father, who had it in pawne for three hundred thouſand crownes, which ſumme alſo the King forgaue them, all to the end they ſhould not impeach nor hinder his voiage to Naples. Moreouer, they renued the ancient league betweene Fraunce and Caſtile, which is between King and King, realme and realme, and man and man of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and promiſed not to hinder his ſaid conqueſt, nor marie any of their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into Naples, England or Flanders, which ſtraight offer of mariage proceeded of themſelues: for a Frier Franciſcan called Frier <hi>Iohn de Mauleon</hi> made this ouner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the Queene of Caſtiles behalfe. Yet all this notwithſtanding ſo ſoone as they ſaw the war begun, and heard that the King was at Rome, they ſent ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors round about to enter into league againſt him, and namely to Venice, I being there preſent, where the league aboue mentioned was concluded betweene the Pope, the King of Romans, them, the Seniore of Venice, and the Duke of Milan: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately whereupon they inuaded the Kings dominions, alleaging that ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was not to be performed, meaning the marriage of their children (being fower daughters and one ſonne) into the houſes aboue mentioned, which ouuerture not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding proceeded of themſelues, as before you haue heard.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the matter. After theſe wars in Italy were ended, and all loſt in the realm of Naples ſaue Caietta, which the K. yet held when theſe treaties of peace began betweene him and the King and Queene of Caſtile: but ſoone after loſt alſo, and the wars in the countrey of Rouſſillon being in like maner ended, ſo that none ſought to endammage other, but each partie to defend their own. They ſent to King <hi>Charles</hi> a gentleman accompanied with certaine Monks of Montferrat, for all their affaires they gouerned by ſuch men, either to ſaue charges thereby, or to diſſemble
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:7649:194"/>
by ſuch inſtruments with the leſſe ſuſpition, as for example they did by <hi>Iohn de Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> the Frier Franciſcan aboue named, who perſwaded the King to reſtore vnto them the countrey of Rouſſillon. Theſe ambaſſadors at their firſt audience, beſought the King to forget the great wrong the King and the Queene had done him. I name alwaies the Queene bicauſe the crowne of Caſtile mooued by hir, and bicauſe hir authority was greater there than hir husbands: and vndoubtedly this was a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable mariage betweene the King hir husband and hir. Then theſe ambaſſadors began to treat of truce, deſiring to haue all their league comprehended therein. The ouuertures they made were theſe: that the King ſhould keepe the poſſeſſion of Caietta, and the other places he yet held in the realme of Naples, and that during the truce he might victuall them at his pleaſure. Further, that there ſhould be a place aſſigned whither all the Princes of the league ſhould ſend their ambaſſadors (at the leaſt, as many as would) to treat of peace, the which being concluded: the ſaid King and Queene meant to continue their conqueſt or enterpriſe againſt the Moores, and to paſſe the ſea out of Granado into Africk, there to inuade the King of Feſſa who was their next neighbour on that ſide. Notwithſtanding ſome were of opinion that they meant rather to hold themſelues contented with that they had already conquered, I meane the realme of Granado, which vndoubtedly was the greateſt and honorableſt conqueſt that hath been obteined in our time <hi rend="sup">8</hi>; yea ſuch as their predeceſſors were neuer able to atchieue. And I wiſh with all my hart for the honor I beare them, that they had neuer mooued other war than this, but had faithfully performed their promiſe to the King. The King ſent the Lord of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieux in Daulphine backe into Caſtile with their ambaſſadors, and ſought to conclude a peace or truce wherein their confederates ſhould not be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: notwithſtanding if he had accepted their offer made by theſe their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, he had ſaued Caietta, which had been ſufficient for the recouerie of the whole realme of Naples, conſidering the great fauour he had there. The ſaid <hi>de Clerieux</hi> at his returne brought a new ouuerture (for Caietta was loſt before he entred into Caſtile) which was, that the King and they ſhould renew their former ancient league, and attempt betweene them at equall charges the conqueſt of all Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, wherat the two Kings ſhould be togither in perſon: but they ſaid they would firſt conclude a generall truce, wherein all their league ſhould be comprehended, and then aſſigne a diet at ſome place in Piemont, whither euery of their confederates ſhould ſend their ambaſſadors, to the end they might honorably depart from their ſaid league. All this ouuerture as we ſuſpected then and vnderſtood perfectly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, was but meere diſſimulation to win time, to the end King <hi>Ferrand</hi> while he liued, and afterward Dom <hi>Frederic</hi> newly crowned King might repoſe themſelues: notwithſtanding I thinke they wiſhed with all their harts the ſaid realme of Naples to be their owne, and ſure they had better title to it, than they that poſſeſſed it <hi rend="sup">9</hi>. But vndoubtedly the houſe of Anious right which the King had was the beſt, although to ſay the truth conſidering both the ſeate of the countrey, and the diſpoſition of the people that inhabite it, me thinke he hath beſt right to it that can get it, for they deſire nothing but alteration. The King afterward ſent the aboue named <hi>de Clericux</hi> back againe into Caſtile &amp; one <hi>Michaell</hi> of Grammont with him, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other ouertures. This <hi>de Clerieux</hi> bare ſome affection to theſe Princes of Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and hoped to obtaine of them the Marquiſat of Cotron in Calabria, which the King of Spaine conquered in the laſt voiage that his men made thither. The ſaid <hi>de Clerieux</hi> pretended title to it, and he is a good plaine dealing man, and one that will eaſily giue credit, eſpecially to ſuch perſonages as theſe were. At his ſecond returne
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7649:194"/>
he brought with him an ambaſſador from the King and Queene, and made his report to the King, which was, that they would hold themſelues contented with that part of the realme of Naples that lies next to Sicilie (to wit, Calabria) for the right that they pretended to the ſaid realme, and that the King ſhould hold the reſt: and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the ſaid King of Caſtile would be in perſon at this conqueſt, and beare equall charges in all things with the King, and indeed he held then and yet holdeth fower or fiue ſtrong places in Calabria, whereof Cotron is one, which is a good and a well fortified citie. I was preſent at this report, which ſeemed vnto moſt of vs but meere abuſe and diſſimulation. Wherefore it was determined that ſome wiſe man ſhould be ſent to them to ſound the bottom of this ouuerture, and thereupon the Lord of Bouchage was ioined in commiſſion with the former ambaſſadors: he was a man of deepe iudgement, and one that had been in great credit with King <hi>Levvis,</hi> and ſo is he alſo at this preſent with King <hi>Charles</hi> his ſonne. The Spaniſh ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor that came with <hi>de Clerieux</hi> would neuer auow his report, but anſwered that he thought the ſaid <hi>de Clerieux</hi> would not make the report, if the King his Maſter and the Queene had not willed him ſo to do; which anſwer cauſed vs ſo much the more to ſuſpect their diſſimulation: beſides that, no man would beleeue that the King of Caſtile would go in perſon into Italy, or that he either would or could beare equall charges with the King.</p>
               <p>After the ſaid Lords of Bouchage, <hi>Clerieux,</hi> and <hi>Michaell</hi> of Grammont with the reſt of their collegues were come to the K. and Queene of Caſtiles court, they lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them in a place where no man could com to commune with them, for the which purpoſe alſo certaine were appointed to watch their lodgings. But they themſelues ſpake thriſe with them: &amp; when the ſaid <hi>du Bouchage</hi> aduertiſed them of the report aboue mentioned made to the King by <hi>de Clerieux</hi> and <hi>Michaell</hi> of Grammont: they anſwered that they would willingly endeuor themſelues to conclude a peace for the Kings honor and profit. And as touching the ſaid report, they confeſſed that indeed ſuch ſpeech had paſſed them by way of communication but not otherwiſe, with the which anſwer <hi>de Clerieux</hi> being diſcontented and not without cauſe, aduowed his report to be true before them both, in the preſence of the ſaid Lord of Bouchage, who with the reſt of his companions concluded a truce, (the King hauing two moneths reſpit to accept it or refuſe it) wherin their confederates were not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, but their ſonnes in lawe, and the fathers of their ſonnes in lawe, namely the Kings of Romanes and England <hi rend="sup">10</hi> (for the Prince of Wales was at that time very yoong) were comprehended therein, they had fower daughters, the eldeſt of the which was a widow, and had been married to the King of Portugales ſonne that laſt died, who brake his necke before hir as he paſſed a carrier vpon a ginnet within three moneths after their marriage. The ſecond and the third were married the one in Flaunders, and the other in England, and the fourth is yet to marrie. After the Lord of Bouchage was returned, and had made his report, the King perceiued that <hi>de Clerieux</hi> had beene too credulous, and that he had done wiſely in ſending <hi>du Bouchage</hi> thither, bicauſe he was now aſſured of that which before he ſtood in doubt of. The ſaid <hi>de Bouchage</hi> aduertiſed him further, that he could effect nothing but the concluſion of the truce, the which he had libertie either to accept or refuſe at his pleaſure. The King accepted it, and ſure it ſerued him to good purpoſe: for it was the breach of their league which ſo much had troubled his affaires, and which hitherto he could by no means diſſolue, notwithſtanding that he had attempted all waies poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Thirdly, the ſaid <hi>de Bouchage</hi> informed the King, that the King and Queene of Caſtile had promiſed him at his departure to ſend ambaſſadors immediately after him

               <p>cauſe of their attainture was for that they had attempted to make him King of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugale that now raigneth. Theſe Lords therefore and gentlemen were by meanes of this marriage recompenſed in Caſtile by the King and Queene, and their lands which they had forfaited in Portugale by attainture, aſſigned to the Queene of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugale (now mentioned) daughter to the ſaid K. and Queene of Caſtile. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe conſiderations, the ſaid K. &amp; Queene repented them of this marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: for you ſhall vnderſtand that there is no nation in the world that the Spaniards hate more than the Portugales, ſo far foorth that they diſdaine &amp; ſcorne them: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid King &amp; Queene lamented much that they had beſtowed their daughter vpon a man that ſhould not be beloued in the realm of Caſtile &amp; their other domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: &amp; if the marriage had been then vnmade, they would neuer haue made it, which vndoubtedly was a great corroſiue to them, yet nothing ſo great as this, that ſhe ſhould depart from them. Notwithſtanding, after all their ſorrowes ended, they led their ſaid daughter and ſonne in law through all the chiefe cities of their realme, and made the ſaid King of Portugale to be receiued for Prince, and their daughter for Princeſſe, and proclaimed them their ſucceſſors after their death. Some comfort they receiued after all theſe ſorrowes, for they were aduertiſed that the ſaid Lady Princeſſe of Caſtile and Queene of Portugale, was great with childe; but this ioy prooued in the end double greefe, ſo that I thinke they wiſhed themſelues out of the world: for this Lady whom they ſo tenderly loued and ſo much eſteemed, died in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of the ſaid childe, not paſt a moneth agone, and we are now in October in the yeere 1498. but the childe liueth <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP17.NOTE4">

                  </ref> and is called <hi>Emanuell</hi> after his fathers name. All theſe greatmisfortunes hapned to them in the ſpace of three moneths.</p>
               <p>Now to returne to the eſtate of Fraunce. You ſhall vnderſtand that about fower or fiue moneths before the ſaid Ladies death, a great misfortune happened alſo in this realme: I meane the death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the eight whereof heereafter you ſhall heare at large. It ſeemed therefore that God beheld both theſe houſes with an angrie countenance, and would not that the one realme ſhould ſcorne the other. For although the death of a Prince ſeeme but a trifle to many, yet is it ſure far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for change of the Prince neuer happeneth in any realme, but it traineth with it great ſorrowes and troubles; and notwithſtanding that ſome gaine by it, yet an hundred fold more loſe, bicauſe at an alteration men are forced to change their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and forme of liuing: for that that pleaſeth one Prince, diſpleaſeth another. Wherefore (as before I haue ſaid) if a man well conſider the ſharpe and ſudden pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments that God hath laide vpon great Princes within theſe thirty yeeres, in Fraunce, Caſtile, Portugale, England, Naples, Flaunders, and Britaine, he ſhall finde that they haue beene heauier and greeuouſer than happened in two hundred yeeres before: and whoſoeuer would take in hand to diſcourſe vpon all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar misfortunes that I my ſelfe haue ſeene, and in a maner knowen all the perſons as well men as women to whom they happened, ſhould make thereof a huge volume and that of great admiration, yea though it contained onely ſuch as haue chanced within theſe ten yeeres. By theſe puniſhments, the power of God ought to be the better knowen, for the plagues he powreth downe vpon great perſonages are ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, grieuouſer, and endure longer than thoſe he ſendeth to the poorer ſort. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, me thinke all things well waied, that Princes are in no better eſtate in this world than other men, if they conſider by the miſeries they ſee happen to their neighbours what may happen to themſelues. For as touching them they cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice their ſubiects at their pleaſures, and God diſpoſeth of them at his pleaſure, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe other than him they haue none ouer them: but happie is the realme that is
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:7649:195"/>
gouerned by a Prince that is wiſe and feareth God and his commandements.</p>
               <p>I haue briefly rehearſed the misfortunes that happened in three moneths ſpace to theſe two great and mightie realmes, which not long before were ſo inflamed the one againſt the other, ſo buſied in enlarging their dominions, and ſo little conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that they already poſſeſſed. And notwithſtanding that alwaies ſome (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid) reioice at changes, and gaine by them: yet at the firſt (euen to them) the death, eſpecially the ſudden death of their Prince is very dreadfull and dangerous.</p>

I will write of the ſudden death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. who being in his caſtel of Amboiſe, had begun the ſumptuouſeſt building, both in the caſtell and the towne, that any King tooke in hand theſe hundred yeeres, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth by the towers, vp to the which men ride on horſebacke, and by the founda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion laid in the towne, the platformes whereof were drawen of ſuch exquiſitenes, that they well declared it to be a worke of maruellous charge, and that could not haue beene finiſhed in long time. For you ſhall vnderſtand, that the King had brought with him from Naples, many excellent workmen in all kinde of arts, eſpecially grauers and painters, and ſure it ſeemed by the foundation, an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of a yoong King that thought not to die, but hoped of long life: for he ioined, togither all the goodly things that were commended to him, were they in Fraunce Italie, or Flaunders. Further, he continued ſtill deſirous to returne into Italie, and confeſſed that he had committed many errors in his voiage thither, and oftentimes rehearſed them, determining if his fortune were to returne againe and recouer his loſſes; to giue better order for the defence of the countrie. The recouerie alſo wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were ready to practiſe againſt Milan: as touching Spaine, you haue heard how it was affected to him. The King of Romanes deſired nothing ſo much as his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and that they two might ioine their forces togither, to recouer that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to them in Italie: for the ſaid <hi>Maximilian</hi> was great enimie to the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, bicauſe they withhold diuers things both from the houſe of Auſtrich (whereof he is heire) and alſo from the empire <ref target="#S5602.BK8.CHAP18.NOTE2">

               <p>Moreouer, the King was wel diſpoſed a little before his death to lead his life accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the commandements of God, to reforme al abuſes in the law &amp; the Church, and to diminiſh his receits &amp; reuenues, purpoſing to leuy of his people onely twelue hundred thouſand franks ouer and aboue his demains, which ſum the three eſtates granted him by way of ſubſidie at Towers at his firſt comming to the crowne, and this money he meant to employ vpon the defence of the realme. But as touching himſelfe he would haue liued vpon his demaines, according to the maner of the ancient Kings of Fraunce, and ſo might he well haue done: for the demaines are great, yea ſo great, if they were well ordered, that they ſurmount a million of franks, certaine cuſtomes and ſubſidies being annexed to them. If this his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation had taken effect, he ſhould thereby much haue eaſed his people, who pay at this preſent aboue two millions and a halfe of franks by way of ſubſidie. Moreouer, he tooke great pains in reforming the abuſes of the order of Saint Benet, and other orders of religion: he called neere about him holy religious men, and often heard them preach: he would willingly haue brought to paſſe if he could, that a Biſhop ſhould haue had but one biſhopricke, and a Cardinall but two, and that the clergie ſhould haue beene reſident vpon their benefices: but it had been a hard matter to reforme the church men. He gaue great almes to poore people a little before his death, as his confeſſor the Biſhop of Angers (who was a woorthie prelate) enformed me. Laſtly, he had built a publike audience where himſelfe heard the ſutes of all men, eſpecially of the poore, and diſpatched many matters: I my ſelfe ſawe him in this place two houres togither but eight daies before his death, which was the laſt time that euer I ſawe him: no matters of great importance were diſpatched there, but by this meanes he held men in feare, eſpecially his officers, ſome alſo of the which he diſplaced for extortion and briberie.</p>
               <p>But the eight day of Aprill, the yeere 1498. vpon Palme ſunday euen, the King being in this glory as touching the world, and in this good minde towards God: departed out of the chamber of Queene <hi>Anne</hi> Duches of Britaine his wife, leading hir with him to ſee the tennice plaiers in the trenches of the caſtle, whither he had neuer led hir before, and they two entred togither into a gallery, called <hi>Haquelebacs</hi> gallerie, bicauſe the ſaid <hi>Haquelebac</hi> had in times paſt held watch and warde in it.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:7649:196"/>
It was the vncleaneſt place about the caſtell, for euery man made water there, and the entrie into it was broken downe: moreouer, the King as he entred, knocked his browe againſt the doore; notwithſtanding that he were of very ſmall ſtature. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he beheld a great while the tennice playing, talking familiarly with al men. I my ſelfe was not preſent there, but his ſaid confeſſor the Biſhop of Angers, and thoſe of his chamber that were neereſt about him, haue enformed me of this I write: for as touching my ſelfe, I was gone home eight daies before to my houſe. The laſt word he ſpake being in health was, that he hoped neuer after to commit deadly ſin, nor veniall if he could: in vttering the which words he fell backeward and loſt his ſpeech, about two of the clocke at afternoone, and abode in this gallerie till eleuen of the clock at night. Thriſe he recouered his ſpeech, but it continued not with him, as the ſaid confeſſor told me, who had ſhriuen him twiſe that weeke, once of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and once for thoſe that came to be cured of the Kings euill. Euery man that liſted entred into the gallerie, where he laie vpon an old mattreſſe of ſtrawe, from the which he neuer aroſe till he gaue vp the ghoſt, ſo that nine howers he continued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it. The ſaid confeſſor who was continually by him tolde me, that all the three times he recouered his ſpeech he cried; My God, and the glorious virgin Marie, Saint Claude, and Saint Blaſe helpe me. Thus departed out of this world this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie puiſſant Prince in this miſerable place, not being able to recouer one poore chamber to die in: notwithſtanding that he had ſo many goodly houſes, and built one ſo ſumptuous at that preſent. Theſe two examples aboue rehearſed declare the greatnes of Gods power, and the ſhortnes and miſerie of mans life, which traineth with it great cares, for the purchaſing of worldly goods and honors, and ſhew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that death is common to all men, the which a Prince can no more auoid than a poore plowman.</p>

               <head>How the holy man Frier Hierom was burned at Florence by the procurement of the Pope, and of diuers Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines and Venetians his enimies. Chap. 19.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue told you before in this diſcourſe of our voiage to Naples, that there was at Florence a Frier <hi>Iacobin</hi> called Hierome, who had been reſident there the ſpace of fifteen yeeres, being a man famous for his holy life, and whom my ſelfe ſaw and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with in the yeere of our Lord 1495. The ſaid Frier as aboue is mentioned foretolde diuers things, and affirmed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies that the King ſhould paſſe ouer the mountaines into Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and preached ſo openly, ſaying, that he vnderſtood both this and all the other things whereof he ſpake by reuelation. He ſaid further, that the King was choſen of God to reforme the eſtate of the Church with the ſword, and to chaſtice Tyrants. But bicauſe he affirmed that he vnderſtood theſe things by reuelation, many murmured againſt him, and he procured himſelfe the diſpleaſure
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7649:197"/>
of the Pope and of diuers others in the towne of Florence. He led the holieſt life that any man could leade, as appeered both by his conuerſation, and alſo by his ſermons, wherein he preached againſt all kinde of vice, ſo that he reformed the looſe liues of many in the ſaid citie. But in this yeere 1498. about the ſelfe ſame time that King <hi>Charles</hi> ended his life, died alſo this Frier <hi>Hierom,</hi> within fower or fiue daies the one of the other. The cauſe why I write this vnto you, is for that he preached alwaies openly that the K. ſhould return again into Italy, to execute the commiſſion that God had giuen him, which was to reforme the Church by the ſword, and to chaſe tyrants out of the countrie; and that in caſe he did it not, God would puniſh him cruelly; and all his former ſermons, and all that he made at this preſent he put foorth in print, and are to be ſold. This threatning that he vſed againſt the King, ſaying that God would puniſh him cruelly vnleſſe he returned: the ſaid Frier writ alſo diuers times to him before his death, and the like told he me with his owne mouth, when I ſpake with him at our returne out of Italie, ſaying that God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſentence againſt the King in heauen, vnleſſe he executed that which he had commanded him, and reſtrained his men from ſpoile. Now you ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that about the time of the Kings death, the <hi>Florentines</hi> were at great variance within the citie: ſome deſired the Kings returne, and waited daily for it, bicauſe of the great hope Frier <hi>Hierom</hi> gaue them thereof: but in the meane time they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed themſelues and waxed maruellous poore, by reaſon of the great charges they ſuſtained in hope to recouer Piſa, and the other places that they had put into the K. hands, whereof the Venetians held Piſa. But other ſome gaue aduice to take part with the league, and vtterly to abandon the King, ſaying that they were abuſed, that it was folly to looke for his returne, and that Frier <hi>Hierom</hi> was an heretike, and a whoormaſter, and that it were almes to put him into a ſacke, and throwe him into the riuer; but he was ſo friended in the towne, that they durſt not attempt it. The Pope alſo and the Duke of Milan writ often againſt this Frier, offering the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines to cauſe Piſa and their other places to be reſtored them, if they would depart from their league with the King, and take Frier <hi>Hierom</hi> and puniſh him. And by chance at that preſent a new Seniorie was choſen in Florence, whereof many were enimies to this Frier. For you ſhall vnderſtand that the ſaid Seniorie changeth at euery two moneths end. Wherefore the ſaid <hi>Hieroms</hi> enimies ſuborned a Frier Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan to picke a quarrell to him and call him heretike, affirming that he abuſed the people, in ſaying he vnderſtood any thing by reuelation: for proofe whereof he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe to the fire, and theſe words he ſpake before the Seniorie. Frier <hi>Hierom</hi> would not preſent himſelfe to the fire, but a companion of his ſaid, that he would enter into the fire for him: and then another companion of the Frier Franciſcans preſented himſelfe on the other ſide: whereupon a day was aſſigned when they ſhould enter into the fire. Vpon the which they both came accordingly, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied each of them with his couent; but the Iacobine brought the ſacrament in his hand, which the Frier Franciſcans and the Seniorie alſo commanded him to lay downe, which he refuſed to do: wherfore they returned againe to their couents. Then the people mooued by the ſaid Frier <hi>Hieroms</hi> enimies, went with the Seniories commiſſion and tooke him, with two others of his companions in his conuent, and at the very firſt racked him cruelly; they ſlue alſo the chiefeſt citizen in the towne called <hi>Francis Vallorie,</hi> bicauſe he was the ſaid Friers great friend. Moreouer, the Pope ſent his commiſſion, whereby he authorized them to make their proceſſe; and in the end they burned them all three. They charged him with theſe two points onely; firſt, that he raiſed diſcord in the towne: and ſecondarily, that he vnderſtood

by his friends of the councell, all that he vaunted to know by reuelation. For my part I will neither accuſe them, nor excuſe them for this deed; neither know I whether they did well or euill, in putting him to death: but ſure he told many things that prooued true, which he could not receiue from the councel of Florence. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the King, and the euils he ſaid ſhould happen to him, they came to paſſe as he propheſied: for firſt he tolde him, of the Doulphin his ſonnes death, and after of his owne, as my ſelfe can witneſſe, for I haue ſeene the letters he writ thereof to the King.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Kings diſeaſe was a Catarre or an Apoplexie: his Phiſitions hoped it would haue fallen down into one of his armes, the loſſe whereof they ſomwhat doubted, but feared no whit any danger of death: notwithſtanding the contrarie to their expectation hapned. He had fower Phiſitions, but gaue credit onely to the woorſt of them, and that ſo great, that the others durſt not vtter their minds: for they would gladly haue purged him fower daies before he died, bicauſe they ſawe in his bodie the occaſions of his death. Euery man ran to the Duke of Orleans, who was to ſucceede him as next heire to the crowne. But King <hi>Charles</hi> his chamberlains cauſed him to be richlie buried, and immediately after his death began ſolemne ſeruice for him, which continued both day and night: for when the canons ended, the friers Franciſcans began; and when they ended the <hi>Bons-hommes</hi>

                  </ref>, which was an order founded by himſelfe: his body remained at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe eight daies, partly in his chamber, which was richly hanged, and partly in the church. All ſolemnities belonging to his funerals, were more ſumptuous than euer were any K. of Fraunce: for his chamberlains, officers, &amp; thoſe that were neere about him, neuer departed from his body till it was laid in the ground, which was about a moneth after his death, al the which ſpace this ſolemne ſeruice continued; ſo that the charges of his funerals amounted to fiue and fortie thouſand franks, as diuers of the receit haue informed me. I arriued at Amboiſe two daies after his death, and went to ſay my praiers ouer his body, where I abode fiue or ſixe howers. And to ſaie the truth, I neuer ſaw ſo great mourning, and lamentation, nor that continued ſo long for any Prince as for him: and no maruel; for he had beſtowed vpon thoſe that were neere about him, namely his chamberlaines, and ten or twelue gentlemen of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie chamber, greater offices and gifts than euer did King of Fraunce, yea, too great to ſaie the truth. Beſides that, he was the mildeſt and courteouſeſt Prince that euer liued; for I thinke he neuer gaue foule word to any man: wherefore in better hower could he not die, both to leaue his fame behinde him in hiſtories, and to be bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of thoſe that ſerued him. And I thinke verily, that my ſelfe am the man whom of all other he vſed roughlieſt, but bicauſe I knew it to be the fault of his youth and not to proceede of himſelfe, I could neuer loue him the woorſe for it.</p>
               <p>After I had ſtaied one night at Amboiſe, I went to the newe King, with whom I had been more familiar than any man: and further, for his ſake had ſuſteined all my
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:7649:198"/>
troubles and loſſes, which now he ſeemed little to remember: notwithſtanding with great wiſdome he tooke poſſeſſion of the crowne, for he changed no penſions that yeere, though halfe the yeere were yet to come, neither diſplaced many offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, but ſaid that he would maintaine euery man in his eſtate; whereby he wan great honor. Moreouer, with all ſpeede poſſible he went to his coronation, whereat my ſelfe was preſent. And theſe that follow repreſented the peeres of Fraunce. The firſt was the Duke of Alençon, who repreſented the Duke of Burgundie; the ſecond the Duke of Bourbon, who repreſented the Duke of Normandie; the third the Duke of Lorraine, who repreſented the D, of Guienne. The firſt Earle was <hi>Philip</hi> L. of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſtaine, who repreſented the Earle of Flaunders; the ſecond <hi>Engilbert</hi> of Cleues, who repreſented the Earle of Champaigne; the third the Earle of Foix, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Earle of Tholouze. And the ſaid King <hi>Levvis</hi> the twelfth now raigning, was crowned at Reims the 27. of Maie, the yeere 1498. and is the fourth that hath come to the crowne by collaterall line. The two firſt were <hi>Charles Martell,</hi> or <hi>Pepin</hi> his ſonne, and <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> who were both of them Maſters of the pallace or gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of thoſe Kings, whom they depoſed from the crowne, which afterwarde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vſurped; the thirde was King <hi>Philip</hi> of Valois; and the fourth the King that now raigneth: but theſe two latter came to the crowne by iuſt and lawfull title. The firſt genealogie of the Kings of Fraunce beginneth at <hi>Meronee:</hi> two Kings had raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Fraunce before the ſaid <hi>Meronee,</hi> namely <hi>Pharamond,</hi> who was firſt choſen King of Fraunce (for his predeceſſors were called Dukes or Kings of Gaule) and his ſonne <hi>Claudio.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Pharamond</hi> was choſen King the yeere of grace 420. and raigned ten yeeres, and his ſonne <hi>Claudio</hi> eighteene, ſo that theſe two Kings raigned eight and twentie yeeres: and <hi>Meronee</hi> who ſucceeded next after, was not ſonne, but coſen to the ſaid <hi>Claudio.</hi> Wherefore it ſeemeth that the right line of the Kings of Fraunce hath failed fiue times: notwithſtanding (as before I ſaid) men begin the firſt line at <hi>Meronee,</hi> who was crowned King in the yeere of our Lord 448. from the which time to the coronation of King <hi>Levvis</hi> the twelfth are numbred 1050. yeeres. But if you reckon from <hi>Pharamond,</hi> you muſt adde eight and twentie more, which make 1078. yeeres ſince there was firſt King of Fraunce. From <hi>Meronee</hi> to the raigne of <hi>Pepin</hi> (when the line of the ſaid <hi>Meronee</hi> failed) are numbred 333. yeeres. From <hi>Pepin</hi> to <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> raigned the true line of the ſaid <hi>Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charlemaine</hi> his ſon, the ſpace of 237. yeeres. The right line of <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> raigned 339. yeeres, and ended in King <hi>Philip</hi> of Valois: and the right line of the ſaid King <hi>Philip</hi> of Valois conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, which hapned in the yeere of our Lord 1498. The ſaid King <hi>Charles</hi> was the laſt of this line, the which had continued 169. yeeres, during the which ſpace, theſe ſeuen Kings raigned in Fraunce, <hi>Philip</hi> of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois, King <hi>Iohn, Charles</hi> the fift, <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth, <hi>Levvis</hi> the 11. and <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, in whom the right line of <hi>Philip</hi> of Valois ended.</p>
