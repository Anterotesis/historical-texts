            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Chriſtian reader, I publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a booke againſt the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> whom I haue in the ſame termed the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> How farre of I was from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing anie ſuch thing at the firſt, and how I was drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it afterward, I haue in that former booke truly reported. And for warrant of my doing before the Lord, I had no doubt but that it ſhould bee an acceptable ſeruice to Chriſt: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding when I reſpect the waightines and neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the worke, I haue alwaies wiſhed, and do wiſh, that ſome man of greater learning might deale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neither as yet am I caſt into any thoughts of doubting, by the miſlike, or fault finding of ſome in all places, which are no <hi>Brownists:</hi> But I am ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thruſt forward by beholding that weakenes of iudgement and want of vnderſtanding not in a feaw, touching the foulnes of <hi>Donatiſme,</hi> and by the ſight of ſuch nerenes of multitudes vnto the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which before I coulde not ſuſpect. Now tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the faultes which are found, which cauſeth the miſlike, they are partelie for the matter it ſelfe, and partlie for the manner of dealing both in it, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo towards the perſons themſelues againſt whome I write. In the matter ſome haue found fault as though I ſhould ſtand to cleere &amp; to iuſtifie al things, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the Booke of Common praier, but alſo in the calling and ordination of our Miniſters, and in our
<pb facs="tcp:19054:4"/>
Church gouernement, others affirme that I haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed the faults which are eſteemed to be in theſe, and made them lighter, at the leaſt by not reproouing them. The firſt ſort I cannot but meruaile at, ſeeing I haue in that my former booke ſet downe expreſſie in theſe words, that the matter in queſtion betweene the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and me, is not about the controuerſie in our Church, as whether there be imperfections, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and faults, in our Worſhip, Miniſterie and Church gouernement, nor how many great or ſmal: but whether there be ſuch heinous enormities as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the verie life, and being of a true Church, and make an vtter diuorſe from Chriſt. I doo then lay open the ſtate of this queſtion ſo plainelie, as I know not how to make it more plaine: now vnles I ſhould run through euerie particular which wee deale in, which I thought to be needleſſe, but now I will a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtand vpon it. They reckon Romiſh faſts, Ember dayes, Saincts eues and Lent: Idoll feaſts, as Alhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, Candlemas, ſeuerall Ladie daies, Saincts daies, dedicating Churches vnto Saints. Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Rogations, and Purifications, Tithes, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Mortuaries, howſling the ſick, with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, abſolution, and blaſphemous dirges, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Sermons, ouer and for the dead. Corrupt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of adminiſtring the Sacraments, the Font, the croſſe in Baptiſme, Baptiſme by women, goſsippings, blaſphemous and hereticall collects. Theſe and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other haue they ſet downe, to bee in the Booke not vnder the termes of faults, blemiſhes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but as hereſies, blaſphemies, and abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that ſuch as ouerturne the foundation of the
<pb facs="tcp:19054:4"/>
Chriſtian faith, deſtroy the ſubſtance of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and take away the life, and beeing of a true Church. To this I haue anſwered, that they be foule ſlaunderours liars, &amp; falſe accuſers, ſhewing that our Church hath renounced in thoſe former things that which is blaſphemous and hereticall, or ſo abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as that it approacheth neereſt to the deſtroying of the faith and holy worſhip of the Lord. As namelie the remiſsion of ſinnes, and merite of eternall life by faſting, which is the doctrine of the Romiſh church. The worſhip and inuocation of Saints and Angels, the power of expelling Diuels by the ſigne of the croſſe, and ſuch like things which the papacie is full of, but reiected by vs. If the <hi>Browniſts</hi> in their replie againſt that I haue written, ſhall prooue by the word of God, that there be great corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in our praiers, in our faſts, in our keeping the Saints dayes, in the Croſſe, and in manie other things which bee in our Church, as in our Miniſterie and Church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And further if their proofes be neuer ſo clere &amp; ſtrong from the Scriptures, yet they anſwere not me at al, nor touch the queſtion or controuerſie between them and me, vnles they can prooue them to be ſuch faults as deſtroy the worſhip of God, ouerturne the foundation of the faith, and take away the verie life and being of true Chriſtianitie. If (I ſay) they do not prooue them, according as they haue ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, to bee blaſphemies, hereſies, abominations, yea the verie worſhip and yoake of Antichriſt, the marke of the beaſt, and his power: I remaine vnanſwered, and they ſtand conuicted as liars, ſlanderers and moſt wicked falſe accuſers not of particular perſons, but of
<pb facs="tcp:19054:5"/>
whole Churches. For I ſhewed in expreſſe wordes that I doo not meddle at all in theſe queſtions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there bee corruptions and faults in our Church condemned by Gods word, whether they bee manie or fewe, whether they bee ſmall or great, but onelie thus farre whether they bee ſuch or ſo great, as make our Churches Antichriſtian. Here therefore I doo intreate the Chriſtian Reader to fixe his eyes in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my writings and theirs, onelie vppon this one queſtion, whether there be in our Church any errors or faults that be found amentall? Looke if I haue in this point by denying that there bee ſwarued from the ſacred word of God, from the iudgement of the holie Churches, and writings of the moſt worthy &amp; noble inſtruments which God hath at all times giuen to be the guides and lights in the ſame. And if it can be prooued, that I haue gone awrie from the trueth but an heire breadth, I will reuoke it: for trueth is to bee bowed vnto and reuerenced, whereſoeuer ſhee ſheweth her ſweete face, of all that looke to haue any part in her. Marke alſo their writings as they ſhall come foorth, and ſee wherein they can conuince me of any error, falſehood or corruption, touching this one forenamed queſtion, vnto which they are to be held ſeeing we ſet all other controuerſies aſide.</p>
            <p>Then touching the ſecond ſorte, which finde fault about handling the matter, as if that I ſhould mitigate or make lighter the faults of our Churches, at leaſt in this, that I do not reprehend them. To this I anſwer, firſt, that vnles it can bee ſhewed, that our Church is guilty in ſome of thoſe crimes which I ſtand to clere it in, I ſee no reaſon why I ſhoulde bee charged to
<pb facs="tcp:19054:5"/>
make things lighter, which I medle not withall, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in ſhewing that they be not fundamentall. Secondlie, I intreate al men to conſider that I ſtand to defend a Church, and not the infirmities or offences of a Church, in which as there be many bad me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, ſo the beſt are traile. If a godlie man becauſe of ſome apparant ſinnes, ſhould be accuſed to be an Atheiſt, an infidell, a traitor, or a moſt vile and filthie wretch: might not he clere himſelfe of ſuch horrible crimes, but it muſt be ſaide, he dooth mittigate his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities or make them lighter? Thirdlie, I doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt them to conſider the ſtate of our people, how ſpeedelie verie manie are carried into great euils and dangers, though not all in the ſame degree. I am of this minde, that where any thing is amiſſe in Gods Church, it is the part and duetie of the faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, all dutifull reuerence and ſubmiſsion being obſerued towards Magiſtrates &amp; publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, peaciblie to ſeeke redreſſe of the ſame, with godlie and charitable reprehenſion. I doo alſo holde that euery chriſtian man is wiſelie and ſoberly (with the like deuties of reuerence, ſubmiſsion, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able behauiour obſerued) to ſeeke to haue his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence informed in all matters, which may any way concerne himſelfe. But we ſee how farre ſome haue ſwarued and doo ſwarue from this. For the rule of charitie and chriſtian dueties being neglected, the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet diſgrace and contempt of men is ſought, and that on either part. The warre is made as deadlie, as if the grounds of chriſtianitie were in queſtion: while ſome paſsing the bounds of modeſtie, others doo replie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them after the ſame manner. Our Sauiour ſaith Satan dooth not caſt foorth Satan: and ſhall we
<pb facs="tcp:19054:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thinke then that ſinne, ſhall caſt foorth ſinne? Such as condemne and abhorre Schiſme and errors, and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate dealing, muſt bee burthened and reproached with the ſame notwithſtanding, which is iniurious. And what is in the mouthes of many againſt this, but that the Papiſts then may as well be excuſed, which condemne Maſter <hi>Luther</hi> and other as the fathers of heretiks, becauſe ſwarmes of Anabaptiſts did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe immediatelie vpon their preaching the Goſpel? When ſhall we then here come to an end? There wil bee contention in the Church: and humaine frailtie hath ſhewed it ſelfe this way, euen among the holie teachers of old, to the ſharp reprehenſion, and in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reproaching one of another, as Maſter <hi>Beza</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the Epiſtle of his Booke againſt <hi>Erastus:</hi> but godlie men when they haue ſomewhat gone awrie, ſeek to amend their fault, by ſubduing their paſsions. Now looke alſo vpon the people, where wee may ſee verie many; who not regarding the chiefe chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian vertues &amp; godlie dueties, as namelie to be meek, to be patient, to be lowlie, to be full of loue and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to deale vprightlie and iuſtly, to guide their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the feare of God, with wholſome inſtructions, and to ſtand faſt in the calling, in which God hath ſet them) giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues wholy to this, euen as if it were the ſumme and pith of religion, namelie to argue and talke continuallie againſt matters in the Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Biſhops and Miniſters, and one againſt another on both ſides. Some are proceeded to this, that they will come to the aſſemblies to heare the Sermons and praiers of the Preacher, but not to the praiers of the booke, which I take to be a more grieuous ſinne than manie doo ſuppoſe. But yet this is not the worſt, for
<pb facs="tcp:19054:6"/>
ſundrie are gone further, and fallen into a damuable Schiſme: and the ſame ſo much the more feareful &amp; dangerous, in that manie do not ſee the foulenes of it, but rather holde them as godlie Chriſtians, and but a little ouerſhot in ſome matters. The ſore is grieuous, and the wound is deepe; as I haue ſmall ioy to behold it, ſo haue I leſſe deſire to make it deeper, wiſhing from my heart, that it might rather be cured. Such as bee of another minde, either in this, or in any thing that I haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I craue of them, that they wil giue me leaue, according to the doctrine and rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>fraterne diſſentire,</hi> to diſſent in ſome thing, without the breach and hindrance of brotherly loue. For as I do greatlie eſteeme that rule of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> let as manie as be perfect be thus minded: if any be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, God will reueale it. But ſo farre as we are come, let vs proceed by one rule, to be like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. ſo do I much lament to ſee it almoſt vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly neglected, and the breach of loue &amp; concord as violent among many, for euery matter wherein they diſſent, as if ſome ground of chriſtianity were in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion between them. I do not meane that a man ought to conſent vnto any error, or vnto any euill commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by others, or to neglect the inſtructing and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, as his place and calling dooth require. But I had rather (as one ſaith) anſwer to God, if I muſt giue account, for mercie, rather than for rigour and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. I knowe there be faults in extremities on both ſides: as on the one ſide vnder a perſwaſion of loue, a man may be ouer fauorable in eſteeming and bearing as brethren, ſuch as hold the foundations of the faith, and yet erre in ſome things, and haue great faultes: ſo on the other ſide, vnder a perſwaſion of zeale againſt
<pb facs="tcp:19054:7"/>
all falſehood and wickednes, they may fall into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable rigour, as very many doo. The nature of man is more prone to this latter, and the fall is more grieuous than in that former; few are carried with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of godly loue, to offend in ouer fauorable iudging their brethren: and becauſe the elect of God haue great infirmities, &amp; the Scripture doth not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men to be rigorous in condemning, if a man hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hatred &amp; zeale againſt all ſin, iudge &amp; repute them as chriſtian brethren, which it may be are not, his fall is not great, although he be ouer fauorable; for through humility he is below. Wheras on the other part, ſuch as condemne with vncharitable rigor, they are lifted vp with ſwelling, and ſo their fall is deeper. This is my meaning in that I ſaide, I had rather an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to God for mercy than for rigour: now as I eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew it in my ſelf, ſo would I be loath, ſeeing rigor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth among many, to giue any occaſion to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the ſame by my writing. If I ſin in this, yet I truſt it is ſo, as no godly charitable man &amp; wel aduiſed wil make an outcry againſt me for it; if I ſhake ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds with ſin let me be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for it, otherwiſe I craue that I may follow the rule of the Apoſtle. But now it wil be ſaid by the third ſort which finde fault with my book that I haue broken this rule towards the <hi>Browniſts:</hi> as alſo that rule of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who willeth to inſtruct with patience ſuch as be contrary minded, becauſe I charg them not only with foule Schiſme, but alſo with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and for which I take it that obſtinacie if it be found in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wil make them heretickes. They differ not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, ſay ſome, in matters of faith, but doo ouer ſhoot the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; that on the right hand: for anſwer vnto theſe, firſt touching the rules of <hi>Paul,</hi> I know he
<pb facs="tcp:19054:7"/>
himſelf did practize the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And he that gaue theſe rules, ſo far as wee are come let vs proceed by one rule, &amp;c. and inſtructing with patience &amp;c. ſaid alſo beware of dogs, beware of euill workmen, beware of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Why did. S. <hi>Paule</hi> this, but mooued with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which the Churches were in by them? Men haue not now the conſideration what it is to condemne the whole worſhip &amp; the Miniſtrie as Antichriſtian, and ſo vtterlie to take away the credite and power of the Miniſtrie and preaching Gods word. Will they eſteeme it to bee leſſe than that which the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did? Againe, I ſee men are ignorant what the power of <hi>Donatiſme</hi> was, how it preuailed and ſpread not onelie among the common ſort, but had hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreths of preachers to publiſh and ſet it foorth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo men knowe the foulenes of <hi>Donatiſme,</hi> nor the poynts of it, and that maketh them offended, that I terme the <hi>Browniſts Donatiſts,</hi> &amp; hold it as a ſchiſme and hereſie. <hi>Creſconius</hi> the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> writing againſt <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> doth reprehend him for calling them he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; becauſe they held the ſame doctrine, as hee ſaith, and if they offended, it could bee but as in a ſchiſme. <hi>Augustine</hi> replieth, that <hi>Schiſma inueteratum eſt haereſis,</hi> Inueterate ſchiſme is hereſie. And ſheweth that ſome thinges they helde were hereticall. The Churches haue condemned it not only as a ſchiſme, but alſo as an hereſie. I haue out of large diſcourſes of the controuerſies betweene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Churches and the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> drawen foorth brieflie all the chiefe heads of <hi>Donatiſme,</hi> and how they did ſtand to maintaine them, and with what ſcriptures. I compare the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> and them together in all poynts generallie held,
<pb facs="tcp:19054:8"/>
and will ſtand to iuſtifie that they bee full <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> euen in the rankeſt <hi>Donatiſme.</hi> If I haue not ſet down the <hi>Donatiſme</hi> aright, and if the <hi>Browniſme</hi> be not the ſame, let me haue the ſhame for euer, that I haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them the title, and can not iuſtifie that they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of it. Let the <hi>Browniſts</hi> chuſe which part they will, either to affirme that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had the truth, or elſe to cleere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Donatiſme,</hi> I will ioyne with them, or rather againſt them in either. And in the meane time I do exhort al other to be ſober min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and diſcreet, and not to thruſt the ſimpler ſort headlong into it, by exclaiming that they bee ouer hardlie dealt withall. For what ſay ſome? If theſe that are called <hi>Browniſts</hi> bee godly men, and but ouerſeene in ſome matters, we will chuſe to ioyne with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the publike aſſemblies of our Church. Theſe men are they in compaſsion of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I write. Now, the chiefe heads in which I compare them are theſe: The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did falſelie accuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Churches and al the Miniſters to be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie polluted, and al their worſhip, and ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues without all order of diſcipline: So haue the <hi>Browniſts</hi> done. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> tooke beginning by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of one man, whom they held to be no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt, but after they made their defence that all were polluted, and all the Miniſters the generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Traitors, Iudaſſes, and perſecutors of the iuſt: that the Churches in the beginning after the times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution were not well ordered by ſeparation of the faithfull from the wicked. For becauſe there were many both Miniſters and people which in time of perſecution to ſaue their liues had denied the faith &amp; ſacrificed to Idols, and deliuered the holie Scriptures
<pb facs="tcp:19054:8"/>
to the perſecutors: and when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> gaue peace, being become Chriſtian, returned and were not caſt foorth. Hereupon the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſaid all were vtterlie polluted: &amp; that becauſe ſome ſuch did ordaine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, at leaſt as they reported, they accuſed all the Miniſters to bee the ſons of traitors which ordained them, and ſo were no miniſters of Chriſt, had no true praier, nor Sacraments. The <hi>Browniſts</hi> affirme that all our aſſemblies which openlie committed Idolatrie, were at the ſound of a Trumpet, at the coronation of the Queene called to be Churches: that the bad were not ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the good: that our ordainers were Idolaters, &amp; that we are their children; no Miniſters of Chriſt, but Baals prieſts &amp; perſecutors: &amp; ſo haue no word of God, nor no Sacraments, nor true church, all being polluted with the open ſinnes committed. Thus both make the holie things of the Lord, which indeed are vnchangeable, or els we could haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: as namely, the word of God, the praiers, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, &amp; the ordination of Miniſters, to be pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; deſtroied by the wickednes of men. The <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> held that Princes were not to compell vnto reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, &amp; ſo cried out of perſecution, &amp; gloried of their ſufferings &amp; multitude of martyres. And what do the <hi>Browniſts?</hi> Theſe things with the reſt will better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the ſeuerall compariſons, as they followe in my booke. I now intreate the reader not to iudge of any one thing vntill he haue read the whole. I alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the ſayings of the ancient writers which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage may be wel waied, for proofe of that for which I cite them. If any ſhall ſay, what ſhall we ground vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon men? I anſwer, I alleage them but to ſhew what the controuerſie was &amp; how it was diſputed on both
<pb facs="tcp:19054:9"/>
ſides: &amp; for this they are ſufficient witneſſes. Beleeue their reaſons as ye find they be confirmed by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scriptures: I haue ſet downe the Latin, leaſt any ſhould thinke I haue not dealt plainlie. And touching the laſt part of this my booke which is an anſwer to Maſter <hi>Greenwood,</hi> concerning read prayer, peruſe it throughlie and then iudge whether I haue charged him wrongfullie in any matter. I do lament that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our people which haue been hearers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, ſhould be ſo ignorant, as to ſuck in ſuch dregs as he offereth. Now to conclude, there are two things which deceiue many, which I deſire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to conſider: one is that they are caried away with many true and notable ſentences of Scripture &amp; worthie principles which the <hi>Browniſts</hi> ſet down, not conſidering or not eſpying how they from them doo draw out falſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, and thereupon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. The other is that they looke not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which followeth vppon their wordes by conſequence, but ſtand vpon this, O they hold no ſuch thing, they haue wrong. Maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> crieth out that he doth not conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neal Churches, he denieth not that the pſalmes are to be ſung to God, he ſaith not that the regenerate do not ſin, he hath no ſuch meaning, he hath wrong. But mark if I haue done him any wrong at all: looke vpon his ſayings, and vpon that which muſt needes followe vpon them. The other <hi>Browniſts</hi> crie out of the like wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs. Iudge not vntil both ye heare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they haue wrong, and ſee mine anſwer. If I haue charged them with matter which either their words doo not expreſſe, or that followeth not from them by neceſſarie conſequence, let me then bee iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged raſh and vncharitable.</p>

Many men thinke that they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19054:10"/>
bee ſprung vp but of late, whereas in very déede it is well knowne there was a Church of them in <hi>London 20.</hi> yeares paſt, and one <hi>Bolton</hi> a principall doer therein, whoſe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full end is not forgotten. I haue termed them the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> How iuſtly, and how charitablie, and with what due conſideration, it ſtandeth me now vpon to ſhewe; leaſt the ignoranter ſort of ſuch as ſomewhat fauour them, ſhould imagine, that I haue iniuriouſlie and falſelie giuen them this odious title, to worke their vniuſt diſcredite. For <hi>Donatiſme</hi> in olde time, about twelue hundred yeares paſt, was condemned as a deteſtable proud Schiſme and hereſie, that began at <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Aphrica,</hi> and was vehementlie withſtood by the faithfull Paſtors, and cut downe by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scriptures, as no learned godlie man will denie. The holie Father <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was the chiefe that did ouerthrowe them, as his writings which are extant, anſwering to their writings at large doo declare. Now, my purpoſe at this time is to compare them together, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> from point to point out of the writings of <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> If it fall out cléere and manifeſt that they agree together, as euen as two peeces of cloath that are of the ſame wooll, the ſame threed, colour, working &amp; breadth: and that an Egge is no liker to an Egge, than they be each to other: I hope all that be ſober minded will not blame me for giuing them the ſame title. Their originall, firſt, (of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> I meane, and how they cut off themſelues) is to bee noted &amp; ſet foorth; which was this. From the birth of our Sauiour Chriſt, for the ſpace of thrée hundred yeares &amp; more, there were euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non great and greeuous perſecutions raiſed vp againſt the Church, by the Romane Emperours, vntill the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great imbraced the holie Goſpell, and gaue peace to the Chriſtians. In thoſe daies of perſecution, ſuch as through feare, or otherwiſe, did deliuer to the cruell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, either the bookes of the holie Scriptures, that they might burne and deface them, or the veſſells appointed for holie vſe in the publike aſſemblies, that they might carrie them away; or the names of the brethren, that they might
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19054:10"/>
finde them out: ſuch (I ſay) were called <hi>traditores,</hi> that is, deliuerers or traitors. There was a rumour that ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence had béen by ſome committed, as no doubt it was by many. Now, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reporteth in his Pſalme againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> there came certaine Biſhops from <hi>Numidia</hi> vnto <hi>Carthage,</hi> a famous Citie in <hi>Aphrica,</hi> to ordeine a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and found <hi>Caecilianus</hi> alreadie ordeined and placed in the Seate: then were they wroth that they could not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine. They ioyned together, and layd a crime vpon <hi>Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus.</hi> They ſay his ordeiner deliuered the holie bookes and was a traitor: whereupon they will haue him reputed no Miniſter of Chriſt, but the ſonne of a traitor. There was no aſſemblie of the learned Paſtors for to iudge in this caſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſtes ordinance and diſcipline: the accuſed and the accuſer did not ſtand foorth for triall. There were no witneſſes produced to prooue the crime: neither were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſcanned by the Scriptures. But <hi>furor, dolus, &amp; tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that is, <hi>furie, deceipt, and tumult,</hi> did beare the ſway, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſheweth in the ſame his Pſalm. They aſſembled which were the accuſers, and <hi>Caecilianus</hi> is condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent, by <hi>Tigiſitanus Secundus,</hi> as hée ſheweth in his firſt booke againſt <hi>Parmenian</hi> Chap. 3. and in his third booke againſt <hi>Creſconius</hi> Chap. 40. Now was there great ſtirre and deuiſion begun: <hi>Donatus,</hi> he ſteppeth foorth and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to haue Iudges (not of <hi>Aphrica,</hi> out beyond the ſeas) to heare the crime which was to be obiected againſt <hi>Caecilianus.</hi> The Emperour appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the matter ſhould bee heard at Rome, where <hi>Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> was cléered, and <hi>Donatus</hi> and his part receiuing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe appealed, accuſing <hi>Meltiades</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he was alſo <hi>traditor,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reporteth in his firſt booke againſt <hi>Parmenian,</hi> Chapt. 5. and ſo they require to haue the cauſe heard by the Emperour, vnto whom they had appealed: where hauing alſo the repulſe, as falſe accuſers, they ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour was corrupted through fauour. They made a ſeparation from <hi>Caecilianus</hi> and thoſe that claue to him. The deuiſion grewe greater and greater, they had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19054:11"/>
and Biſhops on <hi>Donatus</hi> part in proceſſe of time in great number. They condemned not only the Church at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the neighbour Churches in <hi>Aphrica,</hi> as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie therewith, but all Churches through the world as wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together in the guiltines of thoſe Churches of <hi>Aphrica.</hi> They pronounced them all polluted, vncleane, abominable and vtterlie fallen from the Couenant of God, through the pollution of ſuch as had committed ſacrilege, and were not ſeperated. They ſaid there were no Miniſters of Chriſt, no Sacraments, &amp; ſo no true Church among them, but heapes of wicked polluted ſacrilegious perſons, whoſe teachers were all generations of traitors, <hi>Iudaſſes,</hi> &amp; perſecutors of Gods Saints, and that as many as would bee ſaued muſt ſeperate themſelues, and ioyne with the pure ſelected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of <hi>Donatus.</hi> And for theſe reſpects they baptized again all ſuch as fell vnto them, as not being baptized before, but polluted with a prophane waſhing. Now, through the ſhew of burning zeale, and ſtiffe rigorous ſeueritie in condemning ſinne, and by the vehement outcries which they made that the diſcipline was not duely executed, in as much as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane were mingled together in the aſſemblies with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure, and no ſeperation made: many of the people not well ſettled and grounded in the trueth, were terrified and turned vnto them, taking them to be moſt zealous holie men, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie true Church in earth: and with excéeding bitterneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all other as abominable Idolaters and curſed tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, whoſe worſhip God abhorred. It was before the daies of Auguſtine that this ſect began, and in his time was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſpread. And when he wrote that it was againſt all equitie to condemne (as they did at the firſt) the whole world for the ſinne of <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> becauſe if he were guiltie, yet the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches farre off knew not ſo much, but might rather iudge him cléere, being cléered in iudgement. They maintained the matter to prooue that there were no true flocks, nor paſtors after another ſort: and did affirme, that as the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the Churches elſewhere in <hi>Aphrica,</hi> were fallen from God by the pollution of the ſacrilege of Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19054:11"/>
and other: ſo all other Churches in the world were deſtroyed by the like ſacrileges committed in the daies of perſecution by wicked men among them, whoſe ſinnes were open and knowne and no ſeperation made. For thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>Parmenian</hi> a <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Biſhop, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth ſet it downe in his firſt booke againſt him, and third Chapter. <hi>Dicit etiam Parmenianus; hinc probari conſceleratum fuiſſe orbem terrarum criminibus traditionis, &amp; aliorum ſacrilegio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum: quia cum multa talia fuerint tempore perſecutionis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſa, nulla propterea facta eſt in ipſis prouincijs ſeparatio po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulorum.</hi> That is, <hi>Parmenian alſo ſaith, that from hence it is prooued, that the world hath been together made wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or hainouſlie polluted with the crimes of treaſon and of other ſacrileges: becauſe, when many ſuch things were done in the time of perſecution, there was no ſeperation of the people made for the ſame in the Prouinces.</hi> Marke well this ſaying of <hi>Parmenian</hi> the <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> for it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſie ſet downe the ground of <hi>Donatiſme.</hi> The words of <hi>Petilian</hi> another <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Biſhop, to prooue all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Churches to be but ſucceſſors of traitors (as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> doth report them in his ſecond booke againſt him Chapt. 8.) are many, I will onely recite the chiefe of them. This <hi>Petilian</hi> hauing before ſaide, that he which is baptized by one that is dead, his waſhing doth profite him nothing: then procéedeth to ſhewe how farre (as he ſaith) an vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full traitor may be accompted dead while he liueth. And for this be frameth a compariſon betwéene Iudas and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church, condemning them as the worſe. For after he hath ſet forth that <hi>Iudas</hi> was an Apoſtle when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied Chriſt, and ſpirituallie dead when he had loſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of an Apoſtle: and as it was foretold by <hi>Dauid</hi> that another ſhould haue his place, ſo <hi>Matthias</hi> ſuccéeded him in the Apoſtleſhip. He would haue no foole here diſpute that <hi>Matthias</hi> dare away triumph and not iniurie, which by the victorie of Chriſt, had the ſpoyle of the traitor.

For, ſaide the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> the Church is holie, conſiſting of ſuch as be called foorth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the vnpure and wicked world: and therefore no ſeparation being made, but ſuch villanous traitors, ſo vile Idolaters, and their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being communicated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, all your aſſemblies through this mixture are none other before GOD, but heapes of abominable vncleane perſons.

hauing inuaded the Church, it continued ſtill euen then the Temple of God in which Antichriſt did ſit, and that the verie Idolaters were within the Church, were ſealed with the ſigne of baptiſme, profeſſed Chriſt in ſome points right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, their children from ancient diſcent being within the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, and of right to bee baptized, the Miniſterie of Chriſt ſo farre remaining, as that it was the authentick ſeale which was deliuered by the ſame; in a mad furie, like blind hypocrites they condemne the reformation by ciuill power, and purging Gods Temple by the authoritie of Princes, becauſe the Church of Chriſt is founded and built by the doctrine of the Goſpell. Herein they are deceiued, that they imagine the Princes take vpon them to compell thoſe to bée a Church which were none before: whereas indeed they doo but compell thoſe within their kingdome ouer whome the Lord hath ſet them, which haue receiued the ſigne of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, and profeſſe themſelues to bee members of the Church, accordinglie to renounce and forſake all falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to imbrace the doctrine of ſaluation. What other thing did <hi>Ioſias</hi> and other holie Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> when they compelled the multitude of Idolaters which were the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and circumciſed, to forſake their Idolatrie and to worſhip the Lord? It is moſt cléere alſo, that where the reformation of the Kings was not perfect, (as appeareth in the bookes of the Kings and Chronicles) yet all the fouleſt things being aboliſhed, and the ſubſtance of trueth brought in, they were reputed godlie Churches, where many were falſe brethren and open offenders. The <hi>Browniſts</hi> blinded with their ſwelling pride, and not ſéeing the euident matters of the Scriptures, without all order of that holie diſcipline of Chriſt, accuſe, condemne and forſake our Churches, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the appearance of feruent zeale, and rigorous ſeueritie againſt all ſinne, not inferiour to the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> as if they were the onely men that ſtood for Chriſt and his kingdome, they crie out aloude and proclaime all the Miniſters of our Churches to be Antichriſtian, the ſonnes of the Pope, falſe Prophets, <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, that propheſie in <hi>Baal,</hi> and pleade
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19054:14"/>
for <hi>Baal,</hi> perſecutors of the iuſt, bearing the marke, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and life of the beaſt, becauſe they ſay our ordeiners bee ſuch. They ſay wee haue no word of God, no Sacraments nor true Church, but that all is vtterlie polluted and become abominable: our aſſemblies they call the very Synagogs of Antichriſt, vtterlie fallen from the couenant of God, and all that ioyne with them, through the pollution of open ſinners which are not caſt foorth: and therefore they haue ſeparated themſelues, and crie aloude vnto others to doo the ſame if they will be ſaued. What rule of diſcipline haue they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this? Haue theſe things béen brought foorth, ſcanned, diſcuſſed, and iudged in the Synods of the learned Paſtors and teachers of the Churches? Nay, but euen as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith of the other, <hi>furor, dolus, &amp; tumultus, <hi>furie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt and tumult, do beare the ſway.</hi>
               </hi> Then I conclude, that in this poynt of accuſing, condemning, and manner of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating themſelues from the Church, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and the <hi>Browniſts</hi> doo agree and are alike. Some man will here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, that I build vppon a weake ground, or rather vpon the ſand, in prouing the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> to bée all one, becauſe they are alike in accuſing and condemning the Churches, and ſeparating themſelues from the ſame. For the matter reſteth not ſimply vpon the actions; but whether there were iuſt cauſe. The queſtion will bee whether the <hi>Browniſts</hi> doo that iuſtlie, which the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did vngodly. For the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did accuſe the Churches and Miniſters falſely, condemned them moſt wickedly, and therefore their ſeparation could not bee good, becauſe it was from the true Churches of Chriſt: but now if the <hi>Browniſts</hi> obiect open and manifeſt crimes, ſuch as cannot be denied, their caſe doth differ farre. May not a man ſeparate himſelfe from thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, where he ſeeth open ſinners ſuffered on heapes to remaine in the boſome of the Church, and where idolatries, blaſphemies and abominations are committed, where the Miniſters and gouernment be Antichriſtian, but he muſt bée a <hi>Donatiſt?</hi> Moreouer, it is certaine the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all Churches in the world; the <hi>Browniſts</hi> doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19054:15"/>
onely the aſſemblies as they generally ſtand in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is a very great difference. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> hold that the Sacraments or the efficacie of them doth depend vpon the worthines of the Miniſter: the <hi>Browniſts</hi> are not of that mind. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did rebaptize; the <hi>Browniſts</hi> doo vrge no ſuch thing. It may be alſo they are vnlike in ſome other things: if it be ſo, why ſhould they be termed <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts?</hi> Indeed if there be ſuch differences, the <hi>Browniſts</hi> haue great wrong to bee called <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and to bee condemned with ſo wicked a ſect? But what if it fall out otherwiſe, and that it be ſhewed and prooued manifeſtlie that they be all one in theſe things? Shall wee not then ſay they be euen bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? ſhall they not ſtand or fall with the <hi>Donatiſts?</hi> ſhall they be vngodlie Schiſmatickes, and not theſe? I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede from poynt to poynt, to compare them together, that it may appeare whether there be difference. Touching the firſt, it is moſt true that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did accuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Churches and the Miniſters of the Churches moſt falſelie: and I ſay the <hi>Browniſts</hi> are as falſe accuſers as they, and condemne as iniuſtlie in all crimes which they obiect, and ſhall in no wiſe bee found vnlike in this poynt. Yea, will it bee ſayd, how ſhall that appeare? All men doo knowe that the <hi>Browniſts</hi> may without any falſe accuſing lay greeuous faults to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I graunt they may: and I ſay likewiſe, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> might lay as great faults to the charge of many Churches then, and in ſome points greater, &amp; yet be no liers. This is to be prooued by comparing the Churches of thoſe times with ours: for ſo ſhall wee ſee how farre both haue iuſtlie accuſed, or might accuſe, and where they meete together as falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. The <hi>Browniſts</hi> may ſtand foorth and accuſe the church of <hi>England</hi> in this manner: That there bee heapes of open ſinners not ſeparated from among the good, but ſuffered and admitted to the Lords table, at leaſt wiſe in many, or in the moſt aſſemblies: There be prophane ignorant perſons that deſpiſe the holie religion: There bee ſwearers and curſers: There bee thoſe that are puffed vp and ſwell in pride and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19054:15"/>
vaine glorie: There be ſwarmes of drunkards, gluttons and vnchaſt perſons: There be couetous worldlings, and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vſurers, extortioners, oppreſſors, bribers and defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: There be liers, backbiters, and ſlanderers: There bée enuious, hateful and contentious perſons: yea, what ſinnes almoſt are wanting? Where ſhall a man goe but he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to fall into companies of wicked men? This is not alone among the common people; but verie many of thoſe that ſhould bee guiders, lights, and patternes of godlineſſe vnto others, are nothing leſſe. Who is able to deny theſe things? heauen and earth will witneſſe againſt him. We may lift vp our voyces and ſay: wee haue ſinned with our fathers, wee haue done wickedlie. We may confeſſe that our iniquities are heaped vp and reach aboue the clowdes, and that ſhame and confuſion of face is due vnto vs. Wee may crie, ſaue Lord for the godlie ceaſe, the faithfull are diminiſhed from the children of men. The complaints that the Prophets doo make euerie where againſt the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> may verie well be applied againſt vs. Where is loue, where is fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, where is mercie, where is trueth? But now ſhall wee thinke that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had no ſuch things to accuſe the Churches of in thoſe daies? Could they not ſay your aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are full of couetous men, proud perſons both men and women? Had they not iuſt cauſe to complaine that many walked in hatred and diſcord? Doo ye imagine that there were no vngodlie Miniſters? or will ye ſuppoſe that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> and other holie men ſtoode to cléere and iuſtifie the Churches that way againſt the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes?

Many teſtimonies may be brought out of diuers ancient writers for this matter: but I will bring but ſome fewe, and firſt out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which alone are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient being both large and cleere. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was in the time of perſecution before the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſprung vp; and after one perſecution was ouer, he wrote an Epiſtle <hi>de lapſis,</hi> of thoſe that fell and denied Chriſt: In which firſt he triumphantly reioyceth ouer them which ſtoode; then he mourneth dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie for thoſe that fell: and after that he ſheweth why God ſent that perſecution. <hi>Si cladis cauſa cognoſcitur, &amp; medela vulneris inuenitur, Deus probare familiam ſuam voluit.</hi> If (ſaith he) <hi>the cauſe of the ſlaughter be knowne, the cure of the wound is found alſo, God would prooue his familie. <hi>Et quia traditam nobis diuinitus diſciplinam pax longa cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruperat, iace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem fidem, &amp; poenè dixerim dormientem, cenſura coeleſtis erexit.</hi>
               </hi> That is, <hi>and becauſe long peace had corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the diſcipline deliuered vs of God, the heauenlie cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hath raiſed vp the faith lying along, I may ſay almoſt ſleeping.</hi> Then ſhewing that God did not puniſh them ſo much as they deſerued, he ſetteth foorth the greeuous open ſinnes committed in the Church. <hi>Studebant augendo patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monio ſinguli, &amp; obliti quid credentes, aut ſub Apostolis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te feciſſent, aut postmodum facere deberent, inſatiabili cupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis ardore ampliandis facultatibus incubabant.</hi> That is, <hi>They ſtudied euerie one to increaſe their patrimonie, and hauing forgotten either what the beleeuers had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the time of the Apoſtles, or what they ought to doo afterward, they all did applie themſelues to increaſe their riches with an inſatiable burning heate of couetous deſire.</hi> Here is one ſinne that ouerſpread: then he addeth further. <hi>Non in Sacerdotibus religio deuota, non in ministris fides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegra, non in operibus miſericordia, non in moribus diſciplina. <hi>There was not deuout religion in the Prieſts, there was not the ſound faith in the Miniſters, there was not mercie in</hi>

And while ſome doo alwaies take more vpon them, than meeke iuſtice dooth require, they periſh out of the Church: and while they inſolentlie extoll themſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blinded with that very ſwelling of theirs, they loſe the light of the trueth.</hi>
               </hi> What can be more manifeſt than theſe teſtimonies, which ſhewe that there were greeuous open ſinnes committed by multitudes in the Church, not onely of the common ſort, but euen of the teachers? We ſee they did communicate together, as in the old Church vnder the law, heapes of notorious wicked men did flock vnto the Temple and worſhip at the ſame Altar and Sacrifices with the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Paulinus</hi> ſheweth, there were many of all ſorts, both men and women, which did preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſlie, ignorantlie, &amp; with baine glorie prattle of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſo abuſe the bolie word of God. And in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie there were that had ſtepped from ſeculer learning to deale with the Scriptures, which being able to rowle out words, thought they made goodlie ſermons. Therefore if
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19054:18"/>
the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had but complained that there were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of open ſinners in the Church, as proude, couetous, hatefull perſons, irreligious and prophane abuſers of the Scriptures, and not only of the common ſort, but alſo of the teachers: their complaint had béen true. But when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thus; That all that did communicate with any ſuch open ſinners, were polluted by them, and fell from God: and ſo termed all the Paſtors wicked traitors and Iudaſſes, wretches, whoſe worſhip and praiers were abominable, and all the people that ioyned with them prophane and heathen: therein they became falſe accuſers and wicked coudemners: they did with moſt intollerable pride and ſacrilegious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie publiſh a diuorſe betweene Chriſt and his ſpouſe. The <hi>Browniſts</hi> offend in the ſame degree in accuſing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, and caſting foorth the Churches of Chriſt, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that by open ſinners admitted to the Lords table, all are fallen from the couenant of grace, haue no true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor Church, but are as an heape of polluted heathen, whoſe worſhip and praiers are abominable.</p>
            <p>Now that it may appeare vnto euery one that will not ſhut his eyes, that in this point our <hi>Browniſts,</hi> (I ſpeake of the Capitaines) are full <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> I wilenter into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſcourſes, and ſhew vpon what Scriptures they ſtood, and with what arguments they maintained this their wicked hereticall opinion. And what anſwere they recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the holieſeruants of God, the paſtors of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Wherein I deſire the reader to obſerue whether there may be found one haire breadth of difference between them: talke with the <hi>Browniſts</hi> about this point which they hold, that where open ſinners are admitted to the participation of the Sacraments, all which communicate with them are polluted, and caſt away: or reade the bookes and writings of theirs which are ſpread, marke well the ſentences and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture which they alleage and quote, and what reaſons they drawe out of them, and then looke vpon theſe. For I will note the chiefe Teſtimonies of holy Scripture that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did alleage, to proue that all Churches
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19054:18"/>
were polluted by the mixture of open ſinners, and that a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was commaunded by God from ſuch aſſemblies, which are theſe. <hi>Come out from among them</hi> (ſaieth the Lord) <hi>and touch no vncleane thing, and I will receaue yee, and I will be your Father, and you ſhall be my Sonnes and my Daughters, ſaith the Lord God Almightie. 2. Cor. 6. Haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruitefull workes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes but rather reprooue them. Epheſ. 5. Bee not partakers of other mens ſinnes. 1. Tim. 5. A little leauen dooth lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the whole lumpe; and take away the euill from among yee. 1. Cor. 5. Ifanie which is called a Brother be a Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, an I dolater, or couetous, &amp;c. with ſuch ſee that yee eate not. 1. Cor. 5. What hath the Chaffe to doo with the Corne? Ierem. 23. Alſo depart, depart, come out from thence, and touch no vncleane thing, come out from the middeſt thereof and ſeperate your ſelues, yee that beare the veſſels of the Lord. I ſay. 52.</hi> All theſe and ſome other did <hi>Parmenian</hi> the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Biſhop alleage in his Epiſtle. Wee may not thinke that theſe Scriptures were alleaged onely by ſome one <hi>Donatiſt:</hi> for <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his booke <hi>De vnico Baptiſmo</hi> againſt <hi>Petilian</hi> Chapter 14. ſaith, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis enim ſolent in ore habere, quando peccatis aliorum alios cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minantur, ad excuſandum nefas ſeparationis ſuae, videbas fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem &amp; concurrebas cum eo, &amp;c. <hi>For they are wont rather to haue in their mouth, when they accuſe ſome to be guiltie or polluted by the ſinnes of other, to excuſe their wicked ſeperation? Thou ſaweſt a theefe and diddeſt run with him. Pſal. 50.</hi>
               </hi> And <hi>be not partakers of other mens ſinnes, depart and come out from thence, touch no vncleane thing, &amp; he that ſhal touch that which is vncleane ſhal be poluted, and a little leauen dooth leauen the whole lump,</hi> and other ſuch like. Now what the eſtate of the queſtion was, (and how they held men polluted, if they did not ſeperate themſelues) the diſputation betweene the Catholique Biſhops and the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> which were aſſembled at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the Emperour dooth ſhew. Where the names of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> Biſhops that had ſubſcribed their conſent to that confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19054:19"/>
were two hundreth ſeauentie and nine, but ſome of them were not there. Thus <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reporteth their words in the conference of the third day. Chapter 4. <hi>Quia &amp; in eo quod dicebant, &amp; diuinis testimonijs velut astrue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, non eſſe malos in eccleſia tolerandos, ſed ab eis receden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum propter contagium peccatorum: Itaſe dicere demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, vt tamen ignoratis peccatis alienis neminem maculari poſſe faterentur. <hi>Becauſe euen in that which they ſaide, and which they did as it were confirme by the Scriptures, that the euil are not to be tolerate in the Church, but wee muſt depart from them for feare of the contagion of their ſins: they ſhewed that they ſpake it to be vnderſtoode thus, that neuertheleſſe they confeſſed, that no man could be ſpotted with other mens ſinnes which are ſecret.</hi>
               </hi> In this conference the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Biſhops ſtoode vpon this, that the Lord ſaith of the Church <hi>Eſay. 52. There ſhall no vncircumciſed or vncleane paſſe through thee anie more.</hi> And vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Prophet <hi>Hag chap. 2. Aſk the Preeſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lawe. If a man carrie holie fleſh in the lappe of his garment, and the lappe of his garment ſhall touch the bread, &amp;c. Shall he bee ſanctified? The Prieſts anſwered, no. Then if a man that is vncleane touch any of thoſe things, ſhall it not bee vncleane? The Prieſtes anſwer, it ſhall bee vncleane. So is this people, and ſo is this Nation before me ſaith the Lord, and ſo is the whole work of their hands, yea that which they haue offered there, hath been vncleane.</hi> Stay now and ſee whether the very ſame Scriptures bee not in the mouthes of the common ſort of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and whether the writings of the chiefe <hi>Browniſts</hi> bee not euerie where ſpatred with the quotations of them. And to proue the ſame thing which the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> held, and maintained by them; namelie that ſuch as communicate with open ſinners are polluted by their ſinnes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſeparate themſelues? But that this agreement betweene them may yet more fully appeare, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further and ſhewe how theſe matters were diſcuſſed. For otherwiſe it maye bee, ſome man will imagine that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19054:19"/>
the auncient Fathers might defend the Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe allegations of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> after ſuch a ſort as wee canne not truly defende ours at this day. Whereas therefore it was by the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> vrged; depart, depart, come out from among them, ſeperate your ſelues, touch no vncleane thing, &amp;c. the anſwere was by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Churches, that this ſeperation was not to bee made in bodie when the Church is peſtered with open ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but in heart, and not conſenting in minde vnto the ſins openly committed by thoſe with whom they did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the Church. Theſe be the wordes of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Parmenian,</hi> in the ſecond booke Chapt. 18. <hi>Qua ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba isti carnaliter ſentientes, per tot diuiſiones ſeipſos minuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim in ipſa vna Aphrica conciderunt. Non enim intelligunt neminem coniungi cum infidelibus, niſi qui facit peccata Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum, vel talia facientibus fauet: Nec quenquam fieri parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipem iniquitatis, niſi qui iniqua vel agit vel approbat.

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:19054:20"/>
               <hi>And who hath felowſhip with darknes, but he that by the darknes of his conſent forſaking Chriſt doth follow Belial? who putteth his part with infidels, but he which is partarker of that infidelitie? for that way he ceaſeth to be the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God, neither otherwiſe dooth hee ioyne himſelfe to idols. And they which are the temple of the liuing God, and in the middeſt of a crooked and peruerſe generation appeare as lights in the world, hauing the word of life; nothing doth infecte them which they tolerate for vnities ſake, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they pent vp in anie ſtraight, becauſe God dooth dwell in them and walke in them And they depart out of the middeſt of the euill, and in the meane while are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, at leaſtwiſe in heart, leaſt perhaps while they would doo that by ſedition of Schiſme, they ſhould rather be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallie ſeparated from the good, than corporallie from the bad</hi> Thus farre <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> for ſeperation in heart when it cannot be in bodie.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19054:20"/>
all men ought to obey, that if open ſinners come to the holy table of the Lorde, wee ought not there to eate with them. But let vs ſee the anſwer of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the third booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Parmenian</hi> Chap. 3. His words in déede are manie, but I will ſet them downe, becauſe they be ſo full and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to declare, wherein the controuerſie lay betweene the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and the Churches, and why the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> made ſeparation. <hi>In hac velut angustia quaestionis, non aliquid nouum aut inſolitum dicam, ſed quod ſanitas obſeruat eccleſiae, vt cum quiſque fratrum, id eſt Chriſtianorum intus in eccleſiae ſocietate constitutorum, in aliquo tali peccato fuerit deprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, vt anathemate dignus habeatur, fiat hoc vbi periculum Schiſmatis nullum est, atque id cum ea dilectione, de qua ipſe alibi praecipit dicens, vt inimicum eum non existimetis, ſed corripite vt fratrem, non enim estis ad eradicandum, ſed ad corrigendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: quod ſi ſe non agnouerit, neque poenitendo correxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ipſe for as exiet, &amp; per propriam voluntatem ab eccleſiae vnitate dirimetur.

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:19054:21"/>
That is to ſay, <hi>As it were in this ſtraight of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I will not ſpeake any thing that is new or vnwonted, but that which the ſoundnes of the Church dooth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue: that when anie of the Brethren, that is of the Chriſtians, which haue place within in the vnitie of the Church, be taken in ſome ſuch ſinne, that hee may bee accounted worthie to bee excommunicate; let it bee done where there is no danger of a Schiſme, and the ſame with that loue, of which hee commaundeth elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ſaying, eſteeme him not as an enemie, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him as a Brother, for yee are not to roote vp, but to amend. If that hee ſhall not acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, neither reforme himſelfe by repentance, hee ſhall depart out, and by his owne will ſhall bee cut from the vnitie of the Church. For the Lord himſelfe, when he ſaide to the ſeruants, which would gather the tares, <hi>ſuffer both to grow together,</hi> ſhewed a cauſe, ſaying, <hi>least peraduenture while yee goe about to roote vp the tares, ye pluck vp alſo with them the wheate.</hi> Where hee dooth plainelie ſhew, that when there is no ſuch feare, but there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a full ſecuritie of the vndoubted ſtabilitie of the corne; that is when the crime of any one is ſo knowne to all, and appeareth execrable vnto all, that either it can haue no defenders at all, or elſe not ſuch by whome there may a Schiſme fall out: let not the ſeueritie of diſcipline ſleepe, in which the curing of the diſeaſe is ſo much more effectuall, as the confirmation of loue is more diligent. Then alſo this may bee done without any blot of peace and vnitie, and without hurting the corne, when the multitude of the aſſemblie of the Church is free from that crime, for which the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is denounced. For then they rather helpe the paſtor that dooth chaſtice, than the guiltie offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor which reſiſteth, then euerie man dooth healthfullie abſtaine from his fellowſhip, and not ſo much as eate meate with him, not of an enemie like mad rage, but of a brotherlie reprehenſion. Then hee alſo is ſtricken</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:19054:21"/>
               <hi>with feare, and healed through ſhame, when ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf excommunicate of the whole Church, cannot finde a multitude to bee of his fellowſhip with which hee may reioyce in his ſinne, and inſult ouer the good.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which yee ſee expoundeth that place of <hi>Paul, with ſuch eate not,</hi> of thoſe that be excommunicate iuſtlie by the Church, ſhewing that this excommunication cannot be executed when ſuch a multitude doo ſinne that it would bréede a Schiſme, if they ſhould be all caſt foorth and ſo pluck vp the wheate: ſéeing as he ſheweth this cenſure is ordained as a remedie to heale, and not to pluck vp and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. This point peraduenture will ſeeme ſtrange vnto many, that the ſeueritie of the diſcipline ſhould ceaſe as it were when it is a multitude that dooth offend: and leaſt it may be thought not to be his meaning and as he ſpeaketh, that which the ſoundnes of the Church did obſerue, I will ſhew how he proceedeth further in his anſwer. <hi>Neque enim potest eſſe ſalubris a multis correptio, niſi cum ille corripitur, qui non habet ſociam multitudinem, cum verò idem morbus plurimos occupauerit nihil aliud bonis restat quam dolor &amp; gemitus, vt perillud ſignum quod Ezechieli ſancto reuelatur il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae ſi euadere ab illor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath vttered this, a little after he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in <hi>Paule</hi> himſelfe for example in his practiſe: for he willed them to excommunicate the inceſtuous perſon, and he that had willed not to eate bread with a brother ſo called that were a fornicator, doth not will them to caſt them foorth, and not to eate bread with them whom he complaineth of: <hi>2. Epiſtle 12.</hi> that had not repented for the vncleannes, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19054:22"/>
fornication and wantonnes which they had committed: for theſe he ſaith were many: and therefore that S. <hi>Paule</hi> doth not threaten that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came he would caſt them foorth, but he would, as he ſaith, bewaile them. The like we ſee in thoſe that denied the reſurrection, he willed them not to caſt theſe foorth, leaſt a ſchiſme might growe thereupon. After this he addeth, <hi>Et re vera ſi contagio peccandi multitudinem inuaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, diuina diſciplinae ſeuera miſericordia neceſſaria eſt: nam conſilia ſeparationis, &amp; inania ſunt &amp; pernicioſa atque ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lega, quia &amp; impia &amp; ſuperbafiunt, &amp; plus perturbant infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos bonos, quam corrigant animoſos malos.</hi> That is: <hi>And in verie deede if the contagion of ſinning hath inuaded the multitude, the ſeuere mercie of diuine diſcipline is neceſſarie: for the counſell or enterpriſes of ſeparation are both vaine and pernicious, yea ſacrilegious, becauſe they become both wicked and proude, and doo more trouble the good which are weake, than chaſtice the ſturdie ones which are euill.</hi> What can bee more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentlie thundred out againſt the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> than this? and yet the <hi>Browniſts</hi> which are the ſame in their ſchiſme, may not bee ſpoken ſharply vnto. Then a little after <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth as it were conclude in this poynt: <hi>Miſericorditer igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur corripiat homo quod poteſt: quod autem non poteſt patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ferat, &amp; cum dilectione gemat atque lugeat, donec aut ille deſuper emendet &amp; corrigat, aut vſque ad meſsem differat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radicare zizania, &amp; paleam ventilare. <hi>Let a man therefore with mercie correct that which he can: and that which he cannot, let him beare with patience, and with loue let him mourne and lament, vntill he from aboue doo either redreſſe and amend, or elſe differre vntill the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt to roote out the tares, and to winnowe out the chaffe.</hi>
               </hi> Here he alleageth the example of that holie Martyr <hi>Cyprian</hi> which had béen Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the multitude to bee ſo full of groſſe ſinnes, yea verie many of his fellow Biſhops ſpotted with very foule crimes, yet he communicated with them, though not in their ſinnes, which he did euermore reprehend, but in the Sacraments
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19054:22"/>
and holie worſhip of God. Furthermore, anſwering to the ſentence alleaged by the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> out of Ieremie, what hath the chaffe to doo with the corne? He ſaith among all things the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in this did bewray their ſacrilegious ſwelling pride.

The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the true Church to prooue that there ſhould be open wicked ſinners in the Church mingled together with the good vnto the end of the world, alleaged firſt that the Church is called Chriſtes flower where the corne and the chaffe are mixed together, but he hath his fanne, and will purge his flower, and gather the corne into his barne, and burne the chaffe with vnquenchable fire. <hi>Matth. 3.</hi> The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> at the firſt raſhlie replie, that there was not the word flower expreſſed in the Scripture: but when they were conuinced manifeſtlie in that, then they ſay the chaffe did ſignifie the hypocrites and cloſe ſinners: as though the chaffe did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the corne, that it could not be diſcerned. Then next was alleaged the parable of the good ſeede and the bad, and that the ſeruants were forbidden to plucke vp the tares, leaſt they ſhould in plucking vp the tares, plucke vp alſo toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them the wheate, but they are willed to let them grow together vnto the harueſt. <hi>Matth. 13.</hi> Now becauſe it is expreſly ſaid that the Tares appeared or ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and that the ſeruants did diſcerne them, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it cannot be taken alone of cloſe ſinners: The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did flie vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cauil, that the field is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, becauſe he ſaith, the field is this world.

            <p>Thus farre <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> by which words he ſheweth, that albeit the good and the bad ſhall alwaies euen to the end of the world bee mixed together on heapes in the Church, ſo that oftentimes open ſinners cannot bee all caſt foorth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daunger of ſchiſme, and therefore are to be tollerated for the peace of the Church: yet the diſcipline is not to ſleepe, but ſinners are to bee rebuked: ſuch as beare publike office, if they deſerue, are to be degraded and depriued. The noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious wicked are to bee excommunicated, where the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is not guiltie with them, but that they may be forſaken of all and ſo made aſhamed: but loue, according to the rule of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> is to ſit at the ſtearne and to order the whole matter, leaſt the ſeueritie of chaſticing diſcipline, if it were not mixed and tempered, or as I may ſay, delaied with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, might breed tumults and ſchiſmes, and ſeparations: or leaſt on the other ſide, if tollerating patience were not ſharpened by the ſeueritie of diſcipline, it might nouriſh all manner of wickednes.</p>
            <p>We ſee then what was the practiſe of the auncient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that touching the Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of patience and ſeueritie, whollie referred vnto loue, doo make a ſoueraigne plaiſter and medicine, to ſalue and cure the ſores of the Church. Where theſe be not tempered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether there is great decay: for as the rigorous ſeueritie of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19054:27"/>
               <hi>Donatiſme,</hi> without any aſwaging the heate of ſeueritie with the mixture of loue and patient tolleration, doth rend vp and furiouſlie teare all in peeces: ſo doth ouermuch or a looſe ſufferance (for it deſerueth not the name of patience, not regarding Gods honor nor mens ſaluation) ſuffer the Lords field to ouergrowe with tares, and fill the Lords Courts with Goates and Swine: whereby holie things are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prophaned, the weake are made to ſtumble, and many are caſt downe. Touching this firſt point then in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betwéene the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and the Churches, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it with that which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth in his treatiſe <hi>De vnitate Eccleſiae,</hi> Chapt. 16. where hauing ſhewed in the former parts of the ſame booke that the controuerſie was not about the head, which is Chriſt, but about the bodie, which is his Church. For touching the head they agreed, and touching the bookes of holie Scripture and their authoritie, there was no diſſent at all betweene the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and them.</p>
            <p>Then further he commeth to this poynt, that as Chriſt the head is to bee ſought for and knowne onlie in the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Scriptures: ſo the Church, which is his bodie, is likewiſe to be ſought for, found out, and iudged onely by the ſame bookes of Scripture. Then he calleth for triall not by thoſe darke places of the Byble which are ſpoken in figures and may be expounded diuers waies in probable ſenſe; but from the manifeſt cléere teſtimonies, which alſo he alleageth out of many bookes both of the old and newe Teſtament, to prooue that the Church ſhould bee ſpread ouer all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and nations of the world. He anſwereth the places of Scriptures which they alleaged to prooue that the world at ſundrie times had ſo fallen away from God, that a verie fewe true worſhippers remained, and why might not they be now as thoſe fewe? He ſheweth that there be innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimonies to prooue, that the open bad did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate together with the good in the Sacraments, and that the good were fewe in compariſon of the bad ſo mixed with them, of which (after he hath cited many) he commeth at the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19054:28"/>
laſt as it were to a concluſion, that al other things remooued, hee would haue them ſhewe their Church out of the holie Scriptures, and from the places which are not darke. And then it followeth, <hi>Quiſquis ergo huic epistolae reſpondereſe praeparat, ante denunciationem mihi dicat, illi codices domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos ignibus tradiderunt, illi ſimulacris gentium ſacrificaueru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, illi nobis iniquiſſimam perſecutionem fecerunt, et vos eis in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus conſenſiſtis. Breuiter enim reſpondeo quod ſaepè reſpondi, aut falſa dicitis, aut ſi vera ſunt, non ad frumenta Christi, ſed ad eorum paleam pertinent ista quae dicitis, non inde perit ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia, quae optimo iudicio ventilata, istorum omnium ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione purgabitur.</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>Whoſoeuer therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth himſelfe to anſwere this Epiſtle, let him before the denouncing, ſay vnto me; ſuch deliuered the Lords bookes to the fire, ſuch ſacrificed to the Idols of the Gentiles, ſuch haue perſecuted vs moſt vniuſtlie, and you haue conſented vnto them in all things. For I anſwer brieflie, which I haue often anſwered, either ye ſpeake things which are falſe, or elſe if they bee true, that which ye ſpeake pertaineth not to the corne of Chriſt but to the chaffe thereof, the Church doth not periſh thereby, which winnowed with moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect iudgement, ſhall bee purged by the ſeparation of that ſame chaffe.</hi> He addeth: <hi>Ego ipſam eccleſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> requiro vbi ſit, quae audiendo verba Christi &amp; faciendo aedificat ſuper petram, &amp; audiendo &amp; faciendo tolerat eos, qui audiendo &amp; non faciendo aedificant ſuper arenam. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi ſit triticum quod inter zizania creſcit vſque ad meſſem, non quid fecerint vel faciant ipſa zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zania.

               <hi>what the tares haue done, or what they doo. Where that ſpouſe of Chriſt is in the middeſt of the euill daughters, as the lillie among the thornes, not what the thornes haue done, or what they doo. Where the good fiſhes be, which vntill they come vnto the ſhore doo tolerate the euill fiſhes held in the ſame nette together, not what the euill fiſhes haue done, or what they doo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus haue I laide open, that the Church in olde time was full of open wicked men both of miniſters and people: That the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> vnder the colour of zeale and ſeueritie againſt ſinne did ſeparate themſelues, affirming that all were polluted and fallen from the couenant, which did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the worſhip of god and Sacraments with ſuch notorious euill men. All men may ſee by that which I haue noted, that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did maintaine this their opinion with the ſame Scriptures and argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that the <hi>Browniſts</hi> doe maintaine it withall nowe: And receiued the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to confute them, which we make nowe to confute the <hi>Browniſts.</hi> This was the maine point of <hi>Donatiſme,</hi> and as it were the pith &amp; ſubſtance therof: &amp; it is one of the foure chiefe pillers of <hi>Browniſme,</hi> Yea but now the <hi>Browniſts</hi> doe ſeparate themſelues from a worſhip which is Idolatrous, full of blaſphemies and abhominations: The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did rend themſelues from an holy and true worſhip. Indeede where the worſhip is Idolatrous and blaſphemous, a man is to ſeparate himſelfe. But there are many and great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions before it come to that: for it is the true worſhip of God where the foundation is layd and ſtandeth ſure. If there be timber, Hay, and ſtubble built vpon the foundation, the fault is great, ſuch things are not to bee approued: But yet there is Gods true worſhip. And now to come to the verie poynt of the matter: I doe affirme &amp; wil ſtand to iuſtifie, that there were greater corruptions in the worſhip of God, euen in thoſe Churches from which the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did ſeperate themſelues, than be at this day in the worſhip of the Church of England. So that if <hi>Browniſme</hi> be any thing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed in that, the <hi>Donatiſme</hi> may as iuſtly therein be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19054:29"/>
For if wee conſider matters which concerne doctrine, what can any man ſhew ſo corrupt in this our Church, as in the publike worſhip to pray for the ſoules of the dead, and to offer oblations for the dead? This corruption was generall in the Church then, yea long before the dayes of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as it appeareth in <hi>Cyprian</hi> and by <hi>Tertullian</hi> which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and nerer to the time of the Apoſtles; who in his booke <hi>De Monogamia</hi> reaſoning againſt ſecond mariage (for hee was fallen into that error) woulde perſwade any woman that had buried her huſband not to marie againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, he being ſeperated from her in peace &amp; not diuorced, ſhe was to pray for his ſoule, and yearely to offer oblation for him: thus he writeth, <hi>Et pro anima eius oret, &amp; refrigerium interim ad poſtulet ei, &amp; in prima reſurrectione conſortium: &amp; offerat annuis diebus dormitionis eius.</hi> That is, <hi>And let her pray for his ſoule, and craue refreſhing for him nowe in the meane time, and his felowſhip in the firſt reſurrection, and let her offer yearely vpon the day of his departure.</hi> It will bee ſaid by ſome ignorant man, that this was but the minde and practiſe of ſome few, which were corrupt and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious. I anſwere it was the practiſe of the Church in generall, and the corruption ſo auncient, that the ſame <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in his booke <hi>De corona militis,</hi> ſpeaking of it &amp; certain other things ſaith they were obſerued by tradition from the Apoſtles, they were obſerued ſo generally in the Churches and no ſcripture to warrant them. Theſe bee his wordes, <hi>Oblationes pro defunctis, annua die facimus. <hi>Wee make obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the dead in the yeerely day.</hi>
               </hi> The doctrine of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and the doctrine of Free will were crept in alſo, beſides diuers other groſſe errors which ſundrie of the chiefe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers held, ſome in one poynt ſome in an other. Touching Ceremonies not for order and comlynes, but with ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the libertie was exceeding which men tooke, and the corruption greeuous, which was not eſpied but of few. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> for his time nameth theſe, which he ſaith were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by tradition and had no ſcripture to warrant them. firſt in baptiſme hauing ſhewed what they profeſſed, and the thrée

times dipping into the water, hee addeth, <hi>Inde ſuſcepti lactis &amp; mellis concordiam praguſtamus. Exque ea die lauacro quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidiano per totam hebdomadam abſtinemus.</hi> That is <hi>Taken from thence</hi> (hee meaneth from the water <hi>wee firſt taſte the concord of milke and hony, and from that day we abſtaine from the dayly waſhing a whole weeke. <hi>Die dominico ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunium nefas ducimus, vel de geniculis adorare: Eadem immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate a die paſchae in Penticoſtem vſque gaudemus.</hi>

But what ſhould I labour in this point? If the <hi>Browniſts</hi> will affirme that there be as great corruptions in the worſhip of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if we reſpect either doctrine or ceremonies, as were in the Churches from which the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelues, they ſhall be conuinced of groſſe ignorance. And if they ſtand in it, they ſhall ſhew themſelues ſhameles: let the reader in the meane time but looke vpon the Epiſtle of Maſter <hi>Beza</hi> before the new Teſtament, and ſee what he affirmeth in this matter, how corrupt the Churches were. Then I conclude that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſeparating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from Churches more corrupt than the Churche of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19054:30"/>
               <hi>England</hi> in the worſhip of God, as I dare ſtand to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine againſt them: if they denie it, may as well bee excuſed as the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and ſo hetherto they bee euen bretheren with them, or their naturall Children, no difference to bee found at all. And now touching the third and fourth pillars of <hi>Browniſme;</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> cried out that the Churches had no true Miniſters, but that they were all falſe Prophets, Iudaſſes, perſecutors of the iuſt, generations of Traitors, becauſe as they ſaide they had their ordination from thoſe that were ſuch. The <hi>Browniſts</hi> with all their might lift vp their voices, and call vs <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, the marked ſeruants of Antichriſt, falſe Prophets, ſeducers and ſuch like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as they ſay, we are ordeined by Antichriſtian Biſhops, which exerciſe a Diſcipline contrarie to the Diſcipline of Chriſt. Here wee haue to conſider of two things at once the Miniſters and the Diſcipline: let vs firſt ſee what the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> held againſt the Miniſters. This was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon voice among the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> O that matters might be diſputed, diſcuſſed, and ſcanned. But when by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Emperour, the conference ſhould bee holden what miſerable ſhiftes and delayes did they finde out? And in the conference of the third day, Chapt. 2. It is ſhewed that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did accuſe them as Traitors and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: and that this ſaying had been vttered. <hi>Indignum est vt in vnum conueniant filij Martyrum &amp; progenies tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorum. <hi>It is an vnworthie thing, that the ſonnes of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, &amp; the generations of traitors ſhould come together.</hi>
               </hi> When <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had ſaide he was no traitor, <hi>Creſconius</hi> the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> replieth. <hi>Sed ille qui tradidit te, creauit. Fonte deducitur riuus, &amp; caput membra ſequuntur, ſano capite om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſanum est corpus, &amp; ſi quid in hoc morbi vel vitij est, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia membra debilitat, or iginem ſuam respicit quicquid in ſtirpe proceſſit. Non potest innocens eſſe qui ſectam non ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur innocentis. <hi>But he that created thee plaied the Traitor, the riuer or ſtreame is deriued from the Fountaine, and the members followe the head. The head being ſounde, the whole bodie is ſound, and if there bee anie diſeaſe in it, it</hi>
               </hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:19054:30"/>
               <hi>weakeneth all the members. It reſpecteth it owne origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, whatſoeuer groweth out of the ſtock: hee cannot bee innocent, which followeth not the ſect of the innocent.</hi> Theſe be the words of <hi>Creſconius</hi> the <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> by which hee taketh vpon him to proue that <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and all the Paſtors of the Churches had no true ordination, were not true Miniſters of Chriſt, but the generations of traitors: He vſeth as we ſee thrée ſimilitudes. The firſt is to this effect, as the riuer is deriued from the Fountaine, and muſt néedes be ſuch as it is, ſo thoſe that bée ordeined Miniſters are like the ſtreame deriued from the fountaine, the ordeinors being tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Iudaſſes, falſe prophets, perſecutors; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordeined muſt néedes be ſuch alſo. The ſecond is that the members doo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the head: He that ordeineth is the head, the Miniſters ordeined are the members. If the head be infected, the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it goeth into the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, Thy ordeinor, euen thy head was a traitor, thou art then a traitor alſo. The third ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is from the ſtock and the branches that growe out of it: ſuch as the ſtock is, ſuch are the braunches that growe out of it. But he that ordeined thée or created thée a Miniſter, was a falſe Prophet: therefore thou art a falſe prophet: for hée is the ſtock out of which thou dooſt growe, how canſt thou but bee ſuch as the roote, out of which thou dooſt ſpring. The <hi>Browniſts</hi> handling this point, to proue that we be no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt ſet foorth the matter thus: your diſcent and pedegrée is in few degrées deriued from the Pope, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Children of your Antichriſtian Biſhops, which are the creatures of the Pope, who is the eldeſt ſonne of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and his vicar generall in earth, whoſe image, marke, power, and life you beare, and together with him growe, liue, raigne, ſtand, and fall as the branches with the Trée. This is the eloquence of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> which differing in words, containeth the ſame reaſons that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did vſe: for in ſtead of the Fountaine and the ſtreame, the head and the members, they put the Fathers and the Children: for the ſtock and the braunches they put the Trée and the boughes which is all one: And from the roote, as it were
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19054:31"/>
from the Fountaine and head, they deriue the life, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and the Image, &amp;c. Thus they agrée then, that the one part ſaide thoſe which ordeined ye were ſuch as ſacrificed to Idols, and Traitors, verie Iudaſſes, you are their children and like them. The other part ſaieth, thoſe that ordeined yee bée the creatures of Antichriſt, yée receiue the verie life and power of your Miniſterie from them, ye are their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſo the Children of the Pope. Now let vs ſée the anſwer which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> maketh, which is this, <hi>In his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus verbis tuis creatorem meum caput meum, non fecisti niſi traditorem, quem quidem accuſare tantùm, non conuincere potuisti.

But I do not hold his innocencie to be that which hath ordained me a Miniſter, or to be fountaine or head: but thou doeſt returne to that in which Petilian erred, when as Chriſt in the ſanctification of baptiſme is the originall and the head of euerie one that is borne againe: and wilt haue vs come into the curſe, of which it is written: <hi>Curſed is euerie one that putteth his truſt in man.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus farre <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> whoſe anſwere hath two parts. The firſt is, that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did accuſe, but could not prooue that the ordainers were ſuch as in time of perſecution had yeelded to ſacrifice to Idols, or deliuered the holie booke to the fire. The other part is, that whether he that ordained him were a godlie man or a wicked man: the matter is all one touching his ordination and Miniſtrie. The ordination not being mans, the innocencie of man cannot be the ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it cannot bee the head or fountaine: neither can it make his ordination the better. Then likewiſe, the wickedneſſe of the man that ordaineth, cannot be the roote nor the fountain,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19054:31"/>
nor the head. The men which ordaine, are not the fathers of the Miniſtrie, becauſe it is not theirs which they deliuer, but Chriſts. That this is <hi>Auguſtines</hi> meaning it is cléere by that he telleth <hi>Creſconius</hi> he returned to that in which <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> erred. <hi>Petilian</hi> denying that it was baptiſme that had béen miniſtred by an vngodlie man: rendereth this reaſon, that euerie thing muſt haue an originall and an head, or elſe it is nothing. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> repl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth, that Chriſt onely is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall and the head of him that is baptized: and that the baptiſme being Chriſts, and not theirs that did deliuer it: the goodnes of the Miniſter made it not one iot the better, nor the wickednes of the Miniſter any whit the worſe. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding moreouer, that ſuch as take the baptiſme miniſtred by a godlie man to bee better in it ſelfe, than that which is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by a naughtie man: fall into the curſe, of which it is written, <hi>Curſed is euerie one that putteth his truſt in man.</hi> He that hangeth the matters which are Chriſts vpon men, putteth his truſt in men. The ſame anſwere that hée hath made to thoſe his <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of <hi>Aphrica,</hi> doo wee make vnto our <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Firſt they accuſe in moſt bitter and hainous manner, but ſhall neuer be able to prooue their accuſation: for there is no Miniſtrie in <hi>England</hi> ordained by the Pope or for the Pope. The Miniſtrie of publiſhing the Goſpell and deliuering the Sacraments is not the deuice of man, but Chriſtes ordinance: and therefore we receiue it not as theirs that deliuer it, neither doth their godlines or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines make it better or worſe vnto vs. The Miniſtrie was not vtterlie deſtroyed in the Poperie, for there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Sacrament of baptiſme, howſoeuer the Catabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts denie the ſame. How much is the Miniſtrie of Chriſt to bee acknowledged when it is onely to that end for which he ordained it, though the men that ordaine ſhould be moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie? This thing will more fullie appeare when we come to handle the agréement of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> with the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in that ranke <hi>Donatiſme,</hi> affirming it to bee no Sacrament which is miniſtred by an open wicked man.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſuffice to ſhewe, that in denying the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19054:32"/>
to bee Chriſts, they hold the ſame ground and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and receiue the ſelfe ſame anſwere. And for their ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling termes, as generations of traitors, ſeducers, falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Iudaſſes, perſecutors, and ſuch like; I néed not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the compariſon of our men with them, ſeeing they doo in this, as in one of the chiefe vaines of their eloquence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantlie excell. Their baſeſt diſciples can crie out Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts, Baals Prieſts, falſe Prophets, ſeducers, and what not? But it will bée ſayd, that in the matter of diſcipline the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Browniſts</hi> are vnlike. I graunt the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> that euer I haue read, did take no exception that way. That is not alone in queſtion, but whether there were any fault, ſo that exception might betaken. And for this, men are to conſider, that as corruption in doctrine and ceremonies did enter betimes into the Church, and growe a pace: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the diſcipline or externall gouernment was of many neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, abuſed and corrupted. Sundrie of the Paſtors being proud and ambitious, the ſteppes were made for Antichriſt to climbe vp, who challenged not onely an externall power ouer all other, but alſo a Lordſhip ouer the conſcience. Thus much touching the firſt obiection.</p>
            <p>The ſecond difference obiected is, That the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did condemne all Churches in the world: The <hi>Browniſts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne but the Churches of <hi>England.</hi> Indéed the <hi>Browniſts</hi> doo affirme that they be farre from condemning all churches: and ſo here is an apparant difference, and a great, at the firſt ſight, if men doo not narrowlie way and conſider all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. They knowe it is a great preiudice vnto them, if it bée found that they condemne all Churches: but wee may not looke vpon their words of deniall, but vpon the conſequence of their matters. For he that ſhooteth an arrowe at one thing and together therewith ſtriketh another, cannot bee ſayd not to haue ſtriken it becauſe he had no ſuch intent. So muſt wee conſider whether the dart of condemnation which they haue ſhot at the Church of <hi>England,</hi> doo not together with the ſame runne through the ſides of all Churches. I ſtand to prooue it doth, and ſo that they are in this alſo full
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19054:32"/>
               <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> But if they did not, yet they ſhall bee found thus farre in <hi>Donatiſme,</hi> as to condemne ſome Churches of Chriſt. My firſt reaſon ſhall be from hence, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is eſteemed and reuerenced among the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as a ſiſter, and communicated withall: and yet they all know what her faults be, in her aſſemblies, in her worſhip, in her miniſtrie and gouernment, in as much as they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and apparant to them, euen as to our ſelues. Now, that they iuſtifie her as a true Church, we haue their own words: for the harmonie of confeſſions of the Churches, collected and ſet foorth by the Churches of <hi>France</hi> and of the <hi>Lowe Countries,</hi> doth receiue and approoue the confeſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and call it one of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Whereupon I argue thus: If the Church of <hi>England</hi> be Antichriſtian, and idolatrous, and worſhip the beaſt, bow downe vnto him and receiue his marke, becauſe of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment by Biſhops: then the Churches which doo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie knowe the ſame, and yet doo acknowledge her as a ſiſter, and communicate with her, are partakers of her ſinne, and ſo to be condemned with her. Therefore the <hi>Browniſts</hi> condemning it, condemne thoſe that iuſtifie it, knowing the eſtate. The <hi>Browniſts</hi> condemne all thoſe as perſecutors of the iuſt, enemies of Chriſt, and of his kingdome, that ſhall hold them to be Heretickes and Schiſmatickes for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church of <hi>England</hi> and ſeparating themſelues. I argue thus: All the Churches which know the Church of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and her forme of gouernment, and yet doo loue and reuerence her as a true Church of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe as hereticall Schiſmatickes which call it Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and ſeparate themſelues from it. For how can the Churches as they doo eſteeme the Church of <hi>England</hi> as a true ſiſter, and yet not condemne the <hi>Browniſts</hi> as wicked Schiſmatickes, which call it the Synagog of Sathan? Then let the <hi>Browniſts</hi> ſhewe that the Churches haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked this their former iudgement of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> or elſe let them anſwere whether they condemne not all thoſe as no true Chriſtians, which ſhall affirme them to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19054:33"/>
be wicked Schiſmatickes for ſeparating themſelues from the aſſemblies of <hi>England:</hi> If they will deny that the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches eſteeme our Churche as a ſiſter, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them as vngodlie Schiſmatickes, the matter is ſo cléere that all men ſhal ſee them then to be impudent. It may be ſome <hi>Browniſt</hi> will replie, that it cannot be extended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Churches a farre off which is verified in ſome that be nigh. Well, let vs ſee then for the Churches a farre off. Doo not the <hi>Browniſts</hi> condemne the Church of <hi>Geneua?</hi> They will ſay no. But I ſay they doo. For as I ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will they not condemne all ſuch as doo reiect them as wicked Schiſmatickes? This doth the Church of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua.</hi> Which I prooue thus: In that the Church of <hi>Geneua</hi> doth approoue the doctrine of thoſe that haue béen and are her moſt learned and godlie Paſtors: as Maſter <hi>Caluin,</hi> with whom the reſt conſent in doctrine. Now, touching the doctrine of Maſter <hi>Caluin</hi> publiſhed, whereby he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the <hi>Browniſts</hi> as Schiſmatickes, ye may reade it in fourth booke of his Inſtitutions, and the firſt Chapter. It is too large to recite the whole, I will alleage but ſome parts. Looke vppon the ſeuenth ſection where he ſaith: that in the viſible Church in earth, there are verie many hypocrites mingled; verie many that be ambicious, couetous, enuious, curſed ſpeakers, ſome of more impure life, which tollerated for a time, either becauſe they cannot in lawfull iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be conuinced, or elſe becauſe that ſeueritie of diſcipline which ought to be, is not alwaies in force. In the ninth ſection he affirmeth, that the reaſon is ſomewhat diuers in eſteeming priuate men and in eſteeming the churches: for it may come to paſſe (as he ſaith) that wee ought to handle them as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and accompt inſtead of beléeuers, ſuch as wee ſhall thinke vtterlie vnworthie the fellowſhip of the godlie, euen for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent of the church, by which they are tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the bodie of Chriſt. Wee doo not approoue ſuch by our voyce to be members of the Church; but we leaue vnto them that place which they hold among the people of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vntill it be taken from them by lawfull iudgement. Then
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19054:33"/>
he addeth, but wee muſt thinke otherwiſe of the multitude: which if it haue the Miniſterie of the Word, and giue honour, if it haue the Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, no doubt it deſerueth to bee accounted a Church: becauſe it is certaine, thoſe things are not without fruite: ſo wee both keepe for the Uniuerſall Church her vnitie, which diueliſh Spirites haue alwaies endeuored to cutte in ſunder: neither doo wee defraude of their authoritie, the lawfull aſſemblies which are ſeuered according to the fitnes of places. In the tenth ſection hee vttereth that the Lord maketh ſo great account of the communion of his Church, that he eſtéemeth him as a runnagate, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of religion, whoſoeuer he be that frowardlie ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himſelfe from any Chriſtian ſocietie, which imbraſeth but the true Miniſtrie of the word and Sacraments. And a little after he inferreth vpon ſome ground of reaſon, that the departure from the Church is the deniall of God and of Chriſt: affirming moreouer that no crime can bée deuiſed more horrible than with ſacrilegious trecherie, to violate the mariage which the Sonne of God hath vouchſafed to contract with vs. In the twelft ſection hée dooth expounde what is his meaning when he requireth a pure Miniſterie of the word, and pure order of adminiſtring the Sacraments, as notes infallible of the true Church. For hee ſaieth there may ſomewhat that is faltie créepe in, either in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the word, or of the Sacraments, which ought not to ſeparate vs from the Communion of that Miniſtrie. Becauſe there be principles of Religion, without which we cannot be ſaued, and there be points in which men diſſent, and the one part erreth, and yet the vnitie of faith and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie loue is kept: not that we are to approue the leaſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in doctrine, or the ſialeſt corruption in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments. In the thirtéenth ſection he ſaith, that in tolerating the imperfection of life, wée ought to bée much more fauorable: for here we are vpon ſlipperie ground where wée may eaſely fall. And the euill dooth héere lie in waite, and aſſalt vs with ſpeciall engines; for there haue
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19054:34"/>
been alwaies ſome, which being caried with a falſe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an abſolute perfection, as if they were now become certaine ayrie ſpirites deſpiſed the fellowſhip of all men, in whome they ſaw any thing that is humaine or corrupt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. Such were of olde time the <hi>Cathari,</hi> and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi> which fell into the ſame furie: ſuch are at this daye ſome of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> which would ſeeme to haue profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more than others: There be other ſome that offend ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an inconſiderate zeale of righteouſnes than of that mad pride: for while they ſee the life is not anſwerable to the holie doctrine in bringing foorth good fruite among ſuch as haue the Goſpell preached, they iudge by and by that there is no Church. Then he ſheweth further that the offence is iuſt, and God muſt needs puniſh that there is ſuch woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of weake conſciences: but in this they offend, as hee ſaieth, that they knowe not how to keepe anie meaſure in being offended; or omitting that clemencie which the Lord requireth, they giue themſelues wholie vnto immoderate ſeueritie. And becauſe they think there is no Church, where there is not ſound puritie and integritie of life, through the hatred of wickednes they depart away from the lawfull Church, while they thinke they turne a ſide from the faction of the wicked. Then he proceedeth in anſwering their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, they alleage that the Church of Chriſt is holie; he willeth them alſo to vnderſtand by the parables in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that the good and the bad are mixed together. They erie out that it is a thing intollerable that the contagious peſtilence of vices dooth in ſuch violent raging ſort ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread all, hee ſetteth before them the vices that were in the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia.</hi> They obiect that Paul dooth will we eate not with anie called a brother which is of an vngodlie life. Yea here they crie out that if it be not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to eate common bread with ſuch, how ſhould it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to eate with them the bread of the Lord? He anſwereth that it is a great reproach in deede, if dogges and ſwine bee admitted to haue place among the children of God: yea it is alſo much greater, if the ſacred bodie of Chriſt be proſtituted
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19054:34"/>
vnto them. And where the Churches are well ordred, they doo not keepe in their boſome the notorious wicked, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all without difference to that holie banquet: but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors are not alwaies diligent, ſometime they fauour more than they ought or bee more remiſſe. And ſometime they cannot but are letted from exerciſing that ſeueritie which they would. Now when the Church ceaſeth to doo her due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie herein, it is not for euery priuate man (ſaith he) to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himſelfe: euery godly man is indeede to keepe himſelfe from the fellowſhip of ſinne; but it is one thing to eſchewe the fellowſhip of ſinne, and another for hatred thereof to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Communion of the Church. Then hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth further, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> willeth euerie one to examine himſelfe when hee commeth to eate of that bread; and if it were a wicked thing to communicate with the vnworthie, <hi>Paul</hi> would certainelie haue willed vs to looke about leaſt there ſhould bee ſome in the multitude, by whoſe vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes we might be defiled. Theſe things he hath in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and fifteenth ſections: in the ſixteenth ſection hauing ſhewed that the chiefe ringleaders in ſuch ſeparation are led with pride, he willeth the godlie to conſider that in a great multitude there are manie which are truelie, holie and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent before the eyes of the Lord, which are hid from their ſight; that of thoſe which ſeeme diſeaſed or infected, there are manie which doo not pleaſe or flatter themſelues in their vices, but being eftſones awakened with an earneſt feare of God labour to amend. That they muſt not iudge of a man for one fact: when the holieſt men doo ſometime fall moſt grieuouſlie: That the Miniſtrie of the word, and the participation of the Sacraments, haue more force to gather a Church, than that by the fault of certaine wicked men, that whole power may vaniſh or come to none effect. Finallie let them conſider that in eſteeming a Church, the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, is of more waight and certaintie, than the iudgement of man. In the eighteenth ſection, hee ſetteth forth how the holie Prophets of God did not ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, in thoſe horrible and lamentable deſolations which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19054:35"/>
they deſcribe: when moſt of the people and the Prieſtes themſelues were openlie wicked.</p>
            <p>Thus may wee ſee that Maſter <hi>Caluine</hi> condemning the <hi>Browniſts</hi> ſo ſeuerelie by the Scriptures, they muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reuoke <hi>Browniſme</hi> in this point, that the bad pollute the good, and therefore ſeparation to be made, which he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſacrilegious treacherie; or elſe condemne him not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with the Church of <hi>Geneua</hi> which he taught, but alſo all other Churches that imbrace his writings, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for a noble inſtrument of God. Furthermore let the <hi>Browniſts</hi> ſhew any one aſſemblie at this day in the World, in which there bee not open ſinners admitted to the Lords table, and which ſinne in great ſinnes, as either in pride, ſelfe loue, ambition, couetouſnes, idlenes, hatred, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, contention, backbiting, lying and in ſuch like. They ſay all are polluted and fallen away from the couenant, where any that openlie ſinneth is admitted to the holie Communion. How can they ſay then that they doo not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all Churches vnder heauen? Finallie when in their writings they affirme that preſcript forme of prayer impoſed is Idolatrie, a bondage breaking chriſtian libertie, a thing moſt deteſtable, they doo ſo farre condemne all Churches, in as much as there is no one which hath not preſcript forme of Prayer impoſed. And the <hi>Browniſt</hi> which hath publiſhed in Print, a defence of the ſame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth the extreame curſe againſt thoſe that adde to Gods word <hi>Reuel. 22.</hi> and ſaith they adde which make Lawes in the Church, in matters of circumſtance, or things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Which in deede all the Churches doo; and therefore hee layeth that extreame curſe vpon all the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: let no man therefore be ſo ſimple, as to imagine that the <hi>Browniſts</hi> doo condemne but the Engliſh Churches, when their extreame ſeueritie in condemning reacheth ouer all.</p>
            <p>Now to the third thing obiected wherein they may ſeeme to differ from the <hi>Donatiſts:</hi> namely that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did holde that the Sacraments, or the efficacie of them doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19054:35"/>
vpon the worthines of the miniſter: but the <hi>Browniſts</hi> are not of that minde. I anſwere that in this great and ranck poynt of <hi>Donatiſme</hi> I can find no difference at all betwéen them and the <hi>Browniſts:</hi> and let the wordes and meaning of both be ſcanned, and it ſhal appeare manifeſtly that they hold the ſelfe ſame thing, neither more nor leſſe like euen bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Browniſts</hi> affirme that we haue neither worde of God nor Sacraments in our Church. But demaund of them, doth the Sacrament or the efficacie thereof depend vpon the worthines of the miniſter? They will aunſwere, it doth not, but yet it can be no Sacrament of Chriſt vnles hee be a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt that doth deliuer it. If it bee ſaide vnto them <hi>Iudas</hi> was a moſt wicked man, and our Sauiour calleth him a diuell yet was he a miniſter of Chriſt for the time, and the baptiſme he adminiſtred as effectual as the baptiſme of any other. They will replie and ſay, that was ſo becauſe the ſinne of <hi>Iudas</hi> was ſecret, they were not polluted by his vncleannes, becauſe they did not know it: But he that is an open ſinner cannot be a miniſter of Chriſt; and ſuch as receiue the Sacrament at his hand, knowing his wickednes cannot but be partakers of his ſinne and polluted by the ſame. This wil they ſay is not to make either the being of a Sacrament, or the efficacie therof to depend vpon a man, but vpon Gods ordinance that he be a minſter that deliuer it. I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that he muſt be a miniſter that doth deliuer it: And I ſay withall that although the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> may ſeeme by ſome of their ſpeeches to holde a further thing touching this matter, yet lay al their ſayings together, and it is manifeſt they held, that where the ſinne was ſecret in him that did adminiſter, the Sacrament deliuered by him was effectuall, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he were neuer ſo wicked inwardly: but if his ſinne were open, he was no miniſter, and ſo no Sacrament, but the partie that communicateth with him is polluted by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Potilian</hi> the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Biſhop in the beginning of his epiſtle denying that they did rebaptize, but that ſuch as were
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19054:36"/>
baptized in the Churches were not baptized at all, before they baptized them, for confirmation vſeth this ſaying, <hi>Conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia namque dantis attenditur, quae abluat accipientis. <hi>For the conſcience of him that giueth is attended, which may waſh the conſcience of him that receiueth.</hi>
               </hi> Further he ſaith, <hi>Qui fidem a perfido ſumpſerit, non fidem percipit ſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum. <hi>He that will take faith of the faithleſſe, receiueth not faith but guiltines.</hi>
               </hi> And rendring a reaſon for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation he ſaith, <hi>Omnis enim res origine et radice conſistit: &amp; ſi caput non habet aliquid, nihil est. <hi>For euery thing doth conſiſt of an originall and roote: and if any thing haue not a head; it is nothing. Auguſtine</hi>
               </hi> anſwereth to theſe ſayings of <hi>Petilian,</hi> demanding firſt, what if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of him that giueth be ſecret, and perhaps vncleane, how can it waſh the conſcience of him that receiueth? For if the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> ſhall ſay it apperteineth not to the receiuer, whatſoeuer euill lie hid in the conſcience of the giuer, that ignorance perhaps ſhal be of this force, that vnwittinglie he cannot bee defiled by the conſcience of him that baptizeth him: let it ſuffice therefore that the defiled conſcience of an other while it is not knowne doth not pollute, yet will they ſay it ſhall alſo waſh? From whence is he waſhed then that receiueth baptiſme of one that hath a polluted conſcience, and he doth not knowe ſo much? Séeing he ſaith, he that will take faith of him that is faithles, doth not receiue faith, but guiltines. Behold a faithles man doth ſtand to baptize, but he that is to be baptized doth not knowe his vnfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, what doeſt thou thinke he ſhall receiue, faith or guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? If the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> ſay, he receiueth faith, then he infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that it is graunted it may come to paſſe, that a man may receiue faith and not guiltines from an vnfaithful man, and ſo the former ſaying is falſe. But if the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> ſhould anſwere, he receiueth guiltines: then he ſaith the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſhould baptize thoſe againe which were baptized among themſelues by wicked men, whoſe wickedneſſe was ſecrete at ſuch time as they did baptize, but afterward they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19054:36"/>
the practiſe of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> in not baptizing againe any of thoſe which had béen among them baptized by their owne Miniſters whom they eſtéemed godlie, but afterward were diſcloſed to be ranke hypocrites, and ſo they condemned and caſt them foorth, that their iudgement was, that he was a Miniſter of Chriſt, though a reprobate touching his owne perſon, and the Sacrament deliuered by him a true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo long as his wickednes ſay hid from the knowledge of men: howſoeuer the reaſons of Petilian which he vttered in the raſh heate of his furie, may ſeeme to ſtretch further.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this ſcripture doth cut downe all carnall worſhip, as diſagreeing from the nature of God: &amp; therefore may moſt fitlie be alleaged againſt ſuch as ſhall maintaine that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bodilie action in reading is the worſhip of God. But it is friuolous to applie it againſt praying after a preſcript forme: ſeeing a man may vpon a booke pray reading or after a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript forme with ſighes and groanes which procéed of faith. Maſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> termeth this <hi>a bodilie diſtinction.</hi> Doubtles if it be a bodilie diſtinction to affirme that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bodilie action of reading a prayer is not the worſhip of God (which we maintaine againſt the Papiſts in their lippe labour) I knowe not what Maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> will allowe to bee ſpirituall. What manner of ſpirit is his? But now that he will put away all my diſtinctions by his <hi>affirming ſtill</hi> (for thoſe bee his wordes) and what? Euen the whole matter in queſtion betweene vs: who cannot ſee what a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant champion he is, for how falſelie he ſaith he hath proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſhall appeare? Then hauing ſtoutlie affirmed that which is in queſtion, he ſaith, <hi>and yet ſay you to applie this ſcripture thus againſt read prayer is friuolous.</hi> How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in this word <hi>(yet)?</hi> Doth it follow that I do not well in ſaying ſo, notwithſtanding you affirme the contrarie: but you haue a reaſon of great force, which is in theſe words, I <hi>appeale to all mens conſciences for the waight thereof.</hi> Shall the conſciences of all men bee made iudge whether that ſcripture bee rightlie applied? Nay, I appeale from the conſciences of the <hi>Browniſts.</hi> Now in the next words where I affirmed that a man may pray by the Spirite of GOD, with ſighes and groanes vpon a booke, or when
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19054:46"/>
he prayeth after a preſcript forme, and therefore the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſcripture is friuolous, his ſhiftes are as ſlender. For touching this clauſe, that I ſay, (or after a preſcript forme) he ſaith, I goe about to alter the queſtion at the firſt ſteppe. For as much as all our prayers ought to be vttered after a preſcript forme, euen that perfect rule and forme our Sauiour gaue to his diſciples and all poſterities. A great peece of work. By vttering after a preſcript forme, I meane when a man hath learned a prayer eyther of the ſcripture, or framed from thence, and can vtter it without the booke, as it is written.</p>
            <p>And whereas it can not be denied, but that many do pray feruentlie with ſighes and grones and teares, which reade the prayer vpon the booke, or haue it as we vſe to ſay, by hart: He anſwereth that <hi>I begge the queſtion.</hi> If a man do proue the cauſe by the effects, which I doe heere, it is no begging of the queſtion, but a firme proofe. Where any thing is burnt, there hath beene fire. Where there be ſighes and grones in prayer with inward comfort, there is faith, there is Gods ſpirit, but theſe are in ſome that reade their prayers vpon the booke, or vſe preſcript forme.</p>
            <p>Maiſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> thinketh he hath diſputed ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and couered himſelfe, when he can ſay, <hi>ye alter the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, ye begge the queſtion, ye aſſume the queſtion.</hi> Nowe touching the defence of his reaſons he brought. <hi>If thoſe ſighes and grones</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were of faith, that would miniſter matter of prayer without a booke.</hi> This reaſon (as I ſayd) is by connection drawne from the force and effect of faith, and to make it ſtrong and good, I ſaid theſe two things muſt be added, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faith needeth no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward helpe to miniſter matter of prayer, and that it can not ſtande or be ioyned with any outward helpes, which I ſaid are both hereticall. He ſaith <hi>he will lay the wordes againe before me, if peraduenture I may haue grace to call my ſelfe backe.</hi> I looke vpon them againe, and although I did not two yeares (as you vainely imagine) nor yet two daies, conſider of that one ſaying, yet can I not call my ſelfe back,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19054:46"/>
vnleſſe I be conuinced with the light of truth: and that ye ſay <hi>I ſhalbe, and will ſo confirme your ſayings by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that no peruerted ſpirit ſhalbe able to gaineſay or reſiſt. If the ſighes and grones were of faith, that would miniſter matter without a booke,</hi> for the ſcripture (ye affirme) <hi>teacheth euerie where that in praying, the ſpirit onely helpeth our infirmities, no other helpes mentioned, or can be collected in the preſent action of praier through the ſcripture. He hath ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into our harts the ſpirit of his ſonne crying Abba father, wee beleeue, therefore we ſpeake.</hi> From hence now Maiſter <hi>Greene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> concludeth that I haue erred, and from an idle braine, &amp; godles heart haue coined thoſe hereſies, becauſe I conſtraine the propoſition of the preſent action, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto a generall ſentence of all times and actions. This is the ſumme of your anſwere, that before prayer there neede helpes and outward meanes, but in the preſent action of prayer, onely the ſpirit doth helpe, let vs ſee howe true this is, and how it dooth excuſe yee from thoſe hereticall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ye goe about to wipe away with this diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Firſt whereas yee ſay that in the verie time and action of prayer, it is the ſpirit alone without any outward means, becauſe the ſcripture ſaith, God hath ſent into our heartes the ſpirit of his ſonne crying abba Father. I anſwere, that howſoeuer the ſcripture doth extoll or magnifie outwarde helpes, and meanes, yet when they are compared with God which worketh all in all by them, or when the ſcripture will ſet foorth the efficacie and worke to be his alone, they are either not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, or elſe if they be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, ſo caſt down as if they were nothing. God buildeth his Church by the miniſterie of men: yet he ſaith <hi>Paule</hi> planteth, <hi>Appollo</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, but God giueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> increaſe: <hi>So that neither he which pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth is any thing, nor he that watreth, but God that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the increaſe. 1. Co. 3.</hi> And therfore to gather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe ſentences of ſcripture where the ſpirit of God is only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to work praier, becauſe the work is his alone, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19054:47"/>
neede or there may be no outward helps or meanes in the verie inſtant and action of praying, is farre awrie. For I would haue maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> anſwere whether the voice of an other that prayeth, whether faſting, liſting vp the eyes and hands (which hee mentioned) or whether proſirating the bodie and kneeling be prayer it ſelfe, or outward meanes to make the prayer more feruent? Euerie ſimple man will laugh at him, if he ſay they be prayer it ſelfe, whereupon hee muſt bee forced to confeſſe they bee but outward helpes and meanes. Then aſke maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> againe, whether a man be to faſt, to kneele downe, to proſtrate his bodie, to lifte vp his eyes and hands onely before the action of prayer, or in praying? If he anſwere, what a queſtion is that, what foole will ſay before? thoſe things are to be done in the very inſtant and action of prayer. Then all men may ſée that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> hath brought this, I will not ſay from an idle braine, for I ſhould not ſay true; but from an vnſound braine: that he may confirme by many teſtimonies of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the ſpirit onely helpeth our infirmities in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent action of prayer, that no peruerted ſpirit ſhalbe able to gayn-ſay or reſiſt. Yee ſée the ſpirit of trueth can reſiſt it, and proue that not onely before prayer, but euen in the very action of prayer, outward helps and meanes eſpecially for the ignorant and dull are needfull and good, and therefore the <hi>Browniſts</hi> ſpirit is a falſe ſpirit, which ſaith, <hi>The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth euery where that in praying the ſpirite onely helpeth our infirmities, no other helps mentioned or can be collected in the preſent action of praier. In the next place, where hee had ſaid, A troubled heart is the pen of a readie writer, &amp; therfore needeth not a booke.</hi> I ſayd here can bee no good argument without an abſolute perfection in knowledge, cheerefulnes, direction, memorie and vtterance, and that many are ſo perplexed in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of heart, that they cannot pray, which through helpe of outward meanes doe powre foorth tears and ſupplications: He will not allow this for any anſwere; but doth diſtinguiſh of troubled mindes. The troubled minde he ſpeaketh of,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19054:47"/>
               <hi>which is the pen of a readie writer,</hi> is (when the minde is preſently moued with the ſight of ſome ſin or vrged by other occaſion,) <hi>a broken ſpirite, a broken and contrite heart. Pſal. 51.</hi> and not the minde which in diſpaire or doubt is perplexed. Then I anſwere that he muſt allow theſe latter the helpes and outward meanes, that they may be rid of their doubt and perplexitie. Moreouer, there is no man ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in faith, but he hath great remnants in him of diſpaire and doubting. Why elſe did <hi>Dauid</hi> crie out, <hi>Correct me not in thy wrath, my bones are troubled. Pſal. 6. Caſt me not out from thy face Pſal. 51 While I kept ſilence my bones did weare away, my moyſture was turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the drought in Summer. pſal. 32. Hath God forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be merciful, hath he ſhut vp his compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in wrath, pſal. 77.</hi> Whereupon it doth follow, that there is no man but may be fore troubled and perplexed with doubts, when the hand of God is heauie vpon him, and the ſight of his ſinnes doth terrifie him. It is not the glorie of faith to bee where there are us doubts of diſpaire or no perplexities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to get the victorie ouer them when they do aſſaile it. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ignoranter ſorte in perplexitie need outward helps. The next part of mine anſwere, that ſuch as be troubled and perplexed and cannot pray, are holpen by a booke, and by other meanes, hee doth allow and agree vnto, <hi>So that wee make reading one thing and praying another.</hi> Who doubteth that they be two things? did not I ſet downe at the firſt that the bodely action of reading is not the worſhip of God? Then maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> hath his deſire (ſeeing as he ſaith) wee cannot do both at once, he that prayeth ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to God, <hi>My God why doeſt thou hide thy face from</hi> me? But the Prieſt may ſay, <hi>My booke whie art thou ſo euill printed? For when they reade, the heart cannot reaſon and talke with God.</hi> If the matter written in the booke bee a ſpeach directed vnto God, as <hi>In thee O Lord haue I put my truſt, let me neuer be confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded,</hi> let maſter <hi>Greenewood or all the Browniſts</hi> in the world, bring anie coulour of reaſon to prooue, that a man cannot at the ſame
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19054:48"/>
inſtant both vtter it with his mouth in reading, and pray it with his heart. Maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> muſt denie this againe. For alas what ſtuffe is this? or els how did they ſing pſalms to GOD and reade them vpon the booke? how can a man heare and pray both at one inſtant? Then in the next where he ſaith, I did but <hi>aſſume the queſtion,</hi> in affirming that a man may pray by the ſpirit vpon a booke, &amp;c. his argument being thus, <hi>That none worſhip God but they which from the inward faith of the heart bring foorth true inuocation.</hi> This <hi>doo not they that reade vpon the booke while they pray.</hi> I ſayd he bringeth nothing to prooue the aſſumption, but that which is friuolous. For that it is ſayd, <hi>wee would haue men inſtead of powring foorth their hearts, to helpe themſelues vpon a booke.</hi> I anſwere, that we wiſh men to vſe the helpe of a booke that they may the better powre foorth their hearts to GOD, beeing ſuch as are not otherwiſe throughly able. <hi>And that we would haue men to fetch the cauſe of their ſighing and ſorrowing from another mans writing, euen in the time of their begging at Gods hand.</hi> I anſwered, how fondlie doo ye make that to bee the cauſe, which doth but manifeſt the cauſe? For that which we reade or heare doth but ſhewe vnto vs the miſerie which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and how it ſhall bee cured. Now let the reader obſerue how ſimple ſhifts he findeth here. The firſt is the difference betweene reading and praying, the one beeing a powring foorth of ſupplications, the other a receiuing into the ſoule ſuch things as wee reade. I pray ye tell me but this, when one heareth a prayer pronounced by another with whom he praieth, doth not his hearing receiue it into his ſoule, and at the very ſame inſtant alſo he doth powre it foorth as a praier to GOD? Are not the receiuing in and the powring foorth done both at once? How will he auoid the follie that I char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him withall, when receiuing in, and powring foorth, goe together at the ſame inſtant? But it is beyond all the reſt, that he ſaith, <hi>I graunt the whole queſtion, by granting that reading the prayers is not the prayer, but an helpe.</hi> Is it all one to aſke whether a man may be holpen to prayer by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19054:48"/>
and whether the reading it ſelfe be praier? Hereupon hee alſo inferreth, <hi>that all our aſſemblies haue had none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inuocation of Gods name, but an helpe to teach them to power foorth their hearts.</hi> Then belike it followeth that whereſoeuer the helpe is, there is, or there can be no more: becauſe ſuch as read vpon a booke when they pray haue a good helpe to further them, therefore they doo not pray. Becauſe I ſaide it is an helpe to ſuch as bee not otherwiſe throughlie able: I muſt confeſſe that our whole Miniſterie is vnable; a reaſon worthie a <hi>Browniſt.</hi> There be other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whie all Churches vſe preſcript forme, yea whereas all Miniſters be able to pray without a booke.</p>
            <p>Where I ſaide yee ſpeake fondlie to call that the cauſe which dooth but manifeſt the cauſe: yee replie <hi>that I haue forgotten mine atts, becauſe there be mo cauſes than one, there be inſtrumentall cauſes.</hi> I graunt there be moe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes than one. And it is certaine that the efficient cauſe is manifolde, if you meane by fetching the cauſe of their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing from the booke in the time of their begging at Gods hand, the efficient cauſe inſtrumentall: I would haue yee but anſwer whether the inſtrumental cauſe cannot goe with the action, but the action is ouerthrowne or diſgraced? I would alſo demaund whether it followe which yee collect, there is an inſtrumentall cauſe which is an helpe: therefore there is nothing elſe? Are theſe things other than trifles? I ſaide yee did anſwere nothing to that ſaying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, <hi>When ye pray,</hi> ſay our Father which art in Heauen, &amp;c. <hi>Luke 11.</hi> Yee ſeeme, that yee will not anſwer vnles I conclude from this place by Syllogiſme: but yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward yee do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And indeede what needeth a Syllogiſme where the words are of themſelues ſufficient, without anie further conſequence or collection. If our Sauiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund to ſay thoſe words praying, then is it moſt cleere, that to vſe a preſcript forme of words in praying is not idolatrie, nor a thing moſt deteſtable. But yee ſay yee manifeſted in your firſt writing, that our Sauiour did not commaund to vſe thoſe words when wee pray: but to pray according to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19054:49"/>
that forme. Saint Matthew ſay you and Saint <hi>Luke, keep not the ſame words, nor that number of words: hee ſaide not reade theſe words, or ſay th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe words by roate when ye pray.</hi> Theſe reaſons I haue ſlilie paſſed ouer, as you accuſe me. What reaſons? If it be a reaſon there is but one: for Chriſts ſpeech is plaine, <hi>when yee pray ſay thus:</hi> therefore we may vſe thoſe words. But muſt wee vſe them of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and neuer none other? Not ſo, but wee may vſe, and it is neceſſarie for vs to vſe particulars, which are conteined in thoſe generals which are the ground and direction of all prayers. Your one reaſon or that which hath ſhew of reaſon is in this, that Saint <hi>Luke dooth omitte for thine is the Kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> And that in the fourth and fift petitions they expreſſe the ſame matter with ſome difference of words. As though the queſtion were about ſuch a preciſenes in words, that wee might not expreſſe the ſame petition in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther phraſe, but it ceaſeth to be the ſame? Now where I conclude that it is therefore lawfull to vſe a preſcript forme of prayer, which is framed according to the Scriptures, in the aſſemblies. To this yee replie that <hi>becauſe no mans writings are without error, it is pernicious and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous doctrine which I collect.</hi> This yee affirme ſtoutlie, and for proofe bring nothing but thoſe ſtale cauills which I haue ſundrie times anſwered: and now yee will anſwer to the two places alleaged, <hi>Numb. 6.</hi> and <hi>Luke. 11. The prieſtes</hi> yee ſay <hi>were not commanded to vſe thoſe verie words of the bleſsing, when they bleſſed the people,</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon yee bring is from the Hebrew words which are as you ſay, <hi>Coh teborcu, thus ſhall yee bleſſe, Where the worde Coh is an aduerb of ſimilitude, as we ſay after this manner: which cannot be to ſay the ſame, but according to the ſame inſtructions. This word Coh is vſed throughout the Bible in this manner, in all the prophets, when they ſay, thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> To this I anſwer, firſt let all men of anie meane learning, in the Hebrew bee witnes, how vnfit Maſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> is to reaſon from that tongue, when hee can not ſo much as reade two words of it aright. For he ſaieth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19054:49"/>
               <hi>Coh teborcu, and it is Coh tebaracu.</hi> Then for the matter it ſelfe, this learned Hebrucian ſaith, that <hi>Coh being an aduerb of ſimilitude, as we ſay after the ſame manner, it cannot be to ſay the ſame, but according to the ſame inſtructions.</hi> Where ignorance &amp; boldnes are met together, what childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they bring foorth? We muſt beleeue that the Lord when he ſaith, <hi>thus ſhalt thou bleſſe,</hi> and preſcribeth the words, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Prieſts not to ſpeake the ſame words, but the like. And when our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>When ye pray, ſay thus, Our father &amp;c.</hi> It is as much as if he ſhould ſay, in any wiſe ſay not theſe wordes at any time, but the like. For, thus, is not the ſame, but the like. God ſayd to <hi>Moſes, I will ſend thee to Pharao, that thou maieſt bring the children of Iſrael out of Egypt. Moſes draweth backe, ſaying, when I ſhall come to the children of Iſrael and ſhall ſay vnto them, the God of your fathers hath ſent me vnto ye: If they ſhall ſay vnto me, what is his name? what ſhall I ſay vnto them? The Lord ſayd. Thus ſhalt thou ſay to the children of Iſrael, Eheie hath ſent me vnto ye. Moreouer, God ſayd to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Thus ſhalt thou ſay vnto them, The God of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaak, the God of Iaacob hath ſent me vnto ye. Exod. 3. verſ. 13, 14, 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, according to Maſter <hi>Greenwoods</hi> expoſition of <hi>Coh, Moſes</hi> is not commanded to ſay thoſe words but the like. If they ſhould demaund what is his name that hath ſent thee? he may not ſay <hi>Eheie</hi> hath ſent me, becauſe God ſayd <hi>Coh,</hi> that is thus, which is not the ſame words but the like. He might not ſay the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaak,</hi> the God of <hi>Iaacob</hi> hath ſent me vnto ye, which GOD ſaith is his name and memoriall for euer, becauſe God ſayd <hi>Coh,</hi> that is, thus ſhalt thou ſay, but hee muſt ſay the like words. He ſaith further, that <hi>Coh</hi> is ſo vſed in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, when it is ſayd, thus ſaith the Lord. That is, GOD hath not ſpoken theſe very words, which wee bring, might the Prophets ſay, but the like. It is a like thing that Maſter <hi>Greenwood,</hi> or ſome other Hebrucian among the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> hath read ouer al the Prophets in the Hebrew tongue,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19054:50"/>
to finde how <hi>Coh</hi> is euerie where vſed, when he could not reade two words right. And now what ſhall we ſay of the Scriptures? the words, if wee ſhall beléeue the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> are not Gods words, but the words of the Prophets. Is this wholeſome doctrine? Did the Prophets bring any one word which GOD did not put into their mouth? I pray ye Maſter <hi>Greenwood,</hi> or any other <hi>Browniſt,</hi> tell me, did not God ſpeake in the Prophets all the words that they vttered, euen at the verie inſtant when they ſay, thus ſaith the Lord? How can it then ſo wickedly be ſayd, they were not the very ſame words which God ſpake, but the like, becauſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb thus doth ſignifie the like, and not the ſame? But hée rendreth a reaſon, which is, that <hi>we haue but the ſumme of their propheſies recorded vnto vs by the holie Ghoſt, and not all the words.</hi> Becauſe we haue not all the words, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue we not the ſame in thoſe that are ſet downe? Did the holie Ghoſt vſe this word <hi>Coh,</hi> to giue vs to vnderſtand that there is written but an abridgement or ſumme of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and not the ſame words, that they were vttered in, but ſome ſuch like? Againe, did the holie Ghoſt recorde them, &amp; are they not all his words which are written in the ſumme of the propheſies ſet downe? Shall we beléeue this man? I doo beléeue him in this that he ſaith the holie Ghoſt did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord them: for therein he ſpeaketh the trueth. But when he ſaith, that thus ſaith the Lord, is not theſe ſame words ſaith the Lord, but the like, becauſe thus is an aduerb of likenes, it is a vile ſaying. Is not the holie Ghoſt the Lord? If hée had ſpoken thoſe things before in moe words, and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth them in fewer, ſaying, thus ſaith the Lord, doth not he ſpeake theſe fewer words which are written, as well as thoſe moe wordes which were vttered? Are they not then, thus ſaith the Lord, euen the verie ſame words which the Lord ſpeaketh, and not like? If ye make many ſuch expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of words ye may leade me whether ye will. There is then another reaſon rendred to prooue that the Prieſts were not tied vnto thoſe wordes in bleſſing the people, namely, that <hi>in prayer they are bleſſed in the Pſalmes and in the</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:19054:50"/>
               <hi>Chronicles with many other words. And Eli bleſſed Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in other words.</hi> It is not the queſtion whether at any time the people might bee bleſſed in other words, in fewer, or in moe: but whether the Prieſts had not that forme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to vtter in bleſſing the whole aſſemblie, and whether it were Idolatrie to vſe thoſe preſcript phraſes of wordes? As likewiſe it is not maintained that when our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>ſay thus,</hi> that wee may not pray in other words, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our petitions more particularlie: but that we may vſe thoſe words and ſentences as moſt excellent petitions. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> bringeth nothing in his words that followe. For Maſter <hi>Caluine</hi> neuer held it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to pray in that forme of words, though he teach true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that men are not ſo tied vnto it, that they may vſe none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore it ſtandeth firme and ſure that the forme of words in the Lords Prayer is to bee lawfullie vſed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>In the next part Maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> is in a great heate, and maketh an outcrie to call men to the beholding of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, which I, as he ſaith, as a godles man haue done him. <hi>Here</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I muſt call all men that reade this fruitles diſcourſe, to be witneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Indeede ye may well call it a fruitles diſcourſe, which ye call men that reade to beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with ye: and let the reader iudge by your expoſition of <hi>Coh,</hi> whether it be not worſe than fruitleſſe which ye ſpread among the ignorant ſort, which are readie to ſucke in ſuch filthie dregges. The abuſe of my tongue to the defacing of Gods trueth, is that I ſayd, he calleth all men Idolaters. And to make the matter cléere that he ſpake not the words, but I my ſelfe, he maketh a briefe repetition how we fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that matter. But before we procéede any further, I pray ye tell me what is the reaſon, that I hauing ſet downe your whole diſcourſe touching this poynt, ſo that you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie but that I haue alſo ſet it downe truely, you forſake that and ſet downe by péece meale but ſome of your words, and reaſon from them: If I had ment in a godles manner wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to peruert your words, would I haue deliuered them
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19054:51"/>
whole and together in print? It ſeemeth ye haue ſome hope that ſome men will reade your booke, which will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with mine, or which being carried with blind heate, cannot. Now I craue no more of the reader but to marke the whole ſpeach which you deliuered, and mine anſwere to it, and to iudge indifferently. If Maſter <hi>Greenwoods</hi> words bee not ſuch as muſt needes include that which I haue col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, let me beare the blame for that matter, which is one of the leaſt. He ſaith <hi>I haue an euaſion to auoide this foyle,</hi> becauſe I ſayd I tooke it we reaſoned about ſuch groſſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, as a Church is to bee condemned and forſaken for which is defiled therewith. He ſaith he neuer reaſoned to that end in this whole diſcourſe. And I ſay then he muſt go from his owne words, which affirme that read prayer offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to GOD as a ſacrifice is Idolatrie: that to reade the prayer while one praieth, is a chaunging the worke of the ſpirit into an Idoll, a bondage and breaking of Chriſtian libertie, a thing moſt deteſtable, a deuice of Antichriſt. Let all men iudge by theſe ſpeaches what manner of Idolatrie was in queſtion betweene vs. Maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> as if he had wonne the field, will needs put me to my raunſome, and aſketh <hi>what mends I will make him for this ſlandering?</hi> I anſwer, that as your victorie is but in a dreame, ſo my raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome muſt be therafter. If I could ſée I had done ye wrong, I would be ſorie. Ye will haue no man free from ſuch foule Idolatrie, but yet no Idolaters. No Church is free ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe from all ſpot vpon earth. Hereupon ye growe againe into a newe heate, and charge me out of one mouth to giue contrarie ſentence, becauſe I call ye <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> Why man, are ye ignorant of this, that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did confeſſe all men to bee ſinners, and yet the arguments by which they would maintaine their ſchiſme could not bee ſtrong, vnleſſe they would maintaine a perfection, and ſome of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons though they ment not ſo reached ſo farre. And ſo is it with you <hi>Browniſts.</hi> If one ſhould followe ye in all the groſſe abſurdities which will followe from your expoſition of <hi>Coh,</hi> thus ſaith the Lord, could you haue any way but to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19054:51"/>
proteſt ye did meane no ſuch thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wee may not looke what men proteſt they hold, but what doth followe of their reaſons, and then ye ſhall ſee that ſuch as be in ſchiſme and hereſie are with the blaſts of their ſwelling pride toſſed and hurled vpon contrarie Rockes. Now, whereas I ſayd the confeſſion of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> that there is no Church in earth without ſpottes of Idolatrie, doth ouerthrowe the reaſons which they bring to condemne the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot argue thus, this is a fault, it is Idolatrie: therefore this or that aſſemblie which is ſpotted is no true Church. But they muſt prooue the Idolatrie to bee ſuch as deſtroyeth the faith, &amp;c. Maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> would beare men in hand, that I reaſon as ſimplie, as to ſay, if there bée no true Church in earth without ſpots, then the Church of Rome is the true Church, for that hath many ſpots. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that we doo not take it that the ſpots doo make it a true Church, but becauſe there bee onely ſpottes and not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall errors? The fooliſh cauill here is that I aſſume that which I ſhould prooue. Doo I not prooue it by anſwering the vile and ſhameles ſlaunders of yours, when ye affirme euerie ſpot in our Churches to be blaſphemies and hereſies and abominations, and Egyptian ſores? You muſt prooue theſe your ſlaunders true, and I will ceaſe.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the arguments which were ſet down at the firſt. No Apocrypha is to be brought into the publike aſſemblies, all read prayer is Apocripha. Here you ſay I haue nothing to vtter, and yet oppoſe againſt both propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, to royle the doctrine with my feete leaſt others ſhould drink of it. I ſayd your propoſition is falſe becauſe the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the ſcriptures by the preacher, and the prayers of the preacher are not canonicall, which your propoſition doth exclude. Your replie is, that the Sermons and prayers of of the Preacher be the liuely voyce of Gods owne graces which ye mention in your propoſition, and ſo neither Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, nor Apocripha: and ſo not excluded. Touching the Paraphraſe vpon the Pſalmes in meeter, I holde not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall in ſome reſpects: If you baniſh all writings that be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19054:52"/>
not Canonicall, then ye baniſh then. Your anſwere is, that it I will affirme them to be Apocrypha, as ye ſay I cannot but doe; you will prooue they are not to be brought into the publike aſſemblies. Your proofes doe follow: Firſt no mans writings are giuen by the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit, whome alone we are to heare. No mans writings are without er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and imperfections: The Church is builded vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets: If we might bring in mens writings, then al mens writings which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Gods word. No mans writings carie that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie that the pen of the holy ghoſt. No mans writings are authentike confirmed by ſignes and wonders. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is all ſufficient; al men muſt walk by that one rule: To think there were not rules enough preſcribed by the Lorde for his houſe, is blaſphemous and papiſticall. Then ye ſay, the gifts to propheſie, are not Apocryphall, and ſo ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude your propoſition: that onely Gods word and the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly graces of his holy ſpirite are to be offered vp vnto him in the publike aſſemblies. Then touching your aſſumption: I ſayd I ſee not how our ſpeech to God ſhould be called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha. Ye replie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it anſwereth not you, which do not holde an other mans writing to be our ſpeech vnto God. Finally becauſe I ſaid that Apocrypha is that which is not Gods vndoubted worde vnto vs: yee ſay I haue ouerthrowen my ſelfe and caſt out all read prayer, in as much as I deny them to be Canonicall. And ſo affirming that I haue not in both writings made one direct anſwer to this moſt firme propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: Onely the Canonicall ſcriptures and liuely voice of Gods own graces are to be brought into the publike aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for doctrine and prayers: But mens writings are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Canonicall, nor the liuely voice of Gods owne graces. Now maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> hauing thus played the man in erecting (as he ſuppoſeth) ſo mighty a piller, that cannot be ſhaken, could content himſelf to go no further. <hi>I might end here ſaith hee with this vaine man, conſidering the whole matter is proued againſt him: And all that ſolloweth but repetitions of the ſame cauills: but that I muſt cleare</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:19054:52"/>
               <hi>my ſelfe of his vnconcionable ſlaunders.</hi> Hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>mphing thus fully, what ſhall I doe now? I aunſwere, firſt that hee is much deceiued and would deceiue others: as it is written, <hi>The deceiuers ſhall wax worſe and worſe, deceiuing and being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deceiued.</hi> For like as one that among many Apples doth hide and ſell one Crab, ſo he among many true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples doth bring in one falſe concluſion which deceiueth his Schollers. For if he did reaſon thus, wee muſt heare onely the voice of Gods ſpirite, therefore all things in the Church are to be tried by the voice of the ſpirit. No mans writings are without errors and imperfections: therefore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot ground vpon them any further than they be conſonant to the Canonicall ſcriptures. The Church is builded vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, therfore our faith is to reſt no further vpon the ſayings and writings of men, than they be prooued by the doctrine of the Apoſtles &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; he ſhould conclude a truth which is vnanſwerable. But now where maſter <hi>Greenwoods</hi> concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is after this ſorte, therefore nothing but the Canonicall ſcriptures, and the liuely voice of Gods graces is to bee brought into the publike aſſemblies; he concludeth falſely, as ſhall appeare. For if nothing but the perfect rule it ſelfe is to bee brought into the Church: If nothing done by man which hath errors in it, is to haue place in the aſſemblies: If nothing but ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch or that which is the liuely voyce of Gods owne graces is to be vttered in the congregation; then muſt bee taſt foorth not onely al written prayers: but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vnles it be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrew &amp; Greeke, with the Sermons and praiers of the Paſtors. For there is no tranſlation of the Bible without errors, and the bookes are thus farre mans writing reſpecting onely the tranſlation. And furthermore we decide not controuerſies by any tranſlation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but by the authentike copies of the Hebrew and Greek, in one of which the olde teſtament is ſet downe by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, in the other the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the Apoſtles. So that your concluſion doth not ſhut out onely the Pſalmes in mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the whole ſcriptures; vnles you will be ſo bolde as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19054:53"/>
to ſay that tranſlations be without errors, and ſo the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule.</p>
            <p>And now touching the ſecond part, will Maſter <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> bee ſo vnwiſe as to affirme that the errours in the Sermons and in the prayers of the Paſtors, bee the liuely voyce of Gods owne graces? He will aſſuredly denie it: for the graces of GOD (all ſimple men know) bring not foorth errors. Then let him marke his concluſion, no mens writings are without errours and imperfections, therefore no mens writings are to be brought into the publike aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie: is not this concluſion as ſtrong, no tranſlations of the Bible, no Pſalmes in meeter, no Sermons, nor Prayers of the Paſtors, are without errors and imperfections, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none of theſe are to be brought into the publike aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies? Is there any ſo voide of ſenſe, that can not taſt howe ſower this Crabbe is, which Maiſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueieth in among ſo many ſweete Apples? But he replieth further to confirme his matter by argument thus, if anie mens writings may bee brought into the publike aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, then al mens writings which are thought to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Gods word, may be brought in. To prooue the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this propoſition, he ſaith; <hi>If God commaunde any to be brought in as being agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then by that commaundement all are to bee brought in that be agreeable: If there be no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, then none are to be brought in.</hi> I anſwere that God hath commaunded that in the Church all thinges bee done for edification, now the prayers being the ſame, being holy &amp; good, are of like maieſtie &amp; dignitie in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by him that conceaueth them, or from a preſcript forme, the matter reſteth not in that, but in the faith and feruencie of thoſe that pray, there be errours and imperfections, as well in the one as in the other, but to auoide inconuenience, and for the benefite of the ſimpler ſort, a preſcript forme is needefull, &amp; ſo farre commaunded. Then ſee how friuolous this concluſion is, that ſo all mens writinges which are thought to be agreeable to the word, are to bee brought in,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19054:53"/>
ſeeing that which is conuenient in ſome, is not conuenient in all. His reaſons which follow are in effect all one with the former, and prooue not that concluſion of his, to ſhut foorth the preſcript forme of prayer. Let the <hi>Browniſt</hi> now ſet the word <hi>Apocripha</hi> aſide, which is but a woord, and not of the Scriptures, and go to the matter it ſelfe, drawing by firme concluſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that nothing is to be allowed any place in the Church which is not the perfect rule it ſelfe, in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or without errours vttred in ſpeech, and I will yéelde. But this ſhall all the <hi>Browniſtes</hi> in the world be neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do, as I haue ſufficiently ſhewed before. What then, or where is his glorie and victorie which he boaſteth off, to be ſuch that hee needeth to proceede no further? But nowe I woulde haue the reader to vnderſtande my meaning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and how I argue: leaſt any ſhould thinke I compare the hauing the Bible in a tranſlation, and the prayers and Sermons of the Paſtors, with the preſcribed forme of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to be of but equall or like neceſſitie. The ſumme of that I ſet downe is to this effect, that it is falſe which Maiſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> ſtandeth to prooue, namely that nothing with errour in it is to bee brought into the publicke aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, ſeeing there is a neceſſitie of hauing the ſcriptures in a tranſlation: there is alſo a neceſſitie of hauing the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Prayers of the Miniſters, and yet errours in both, that which is of neceſſitie to be had, may not bee caſt foorth, becauſe of imperfections and errours: then alſo preſcript forme of prayers, though not of neceſſitie, yet for conueniencie vnto edification, is not to be caſt foorth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of imperfections, being not to increaſe, but to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the errours in praying.</p>
            <p>The next argument is this, <hi>Wee muſt doe nothing in the worſhip of God, without warrant of his word. Read prayers haue no warrant of his woorde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How falſe this aſſumption is, namely, <hi>That to reade a prayer when one doth pray, or to followe a preſcript forme, hath no warrant in Gods woord,</hi> I haue ſhewed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19054:54"/>
by ſundrie ſcriptures and reaſons, and anſwered al the ſhifts brought againſt them, for which I referre the Reader to my former booke.</p>
            <p>Maiſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> preſſed with the waight of truth, and finding he had vttred groſſe matter, could be content (but that as he ſaith to anſwere vnconſcionable ſlaunders) to ſtay in the firſt argument: as hauing wonne the field, but yet he goeth on, and by vaine ſhiftes wil doe as well as he can to couer his fault. Firſt he accuſeth me that not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing anſwered one reaſon, I haue with much euill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (as the handling ſheweth) peruerted them, ſaying hee will leaue them to be iudged of them that ſhall ſee his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: and ſeeing I would not Print it, he will anſwere my chief obiections. Touching this I anſwere, that your words are manie, and I eſteemed it a wearieſome matter to write them all, accounting it ſufficient to note your reaſons, but looke whatſoeuer ye complayne off, that I haue peruerted and done ye wrong in, ye ſhall haue them in thoſe pointes fully and wholy deliuered, that all the worlde may ſee and iudge betweene vs, whether I haue wilfully, and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably, and as a godleſſe man (as ye accuſe me) charged ye with any one thing which your words doe not containe.</p>
            <p>Now to proceede to your replie: Firſt, yee ſay that I graunt your Argument is ſounde, if yee put difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween reading vpon the booke, and that which one hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of the booke. For by your owne confeſſion (ſay you) <hi>God hath not giuen any commandement to read prayer, and ſo it hath no warrant.</hi> Hereupon yee charge mee, that as an vnconſtant man, I call back againe that which I had graunted: I ſaide <hi>I did not remember that euer I did read in the holie Scriptures that God commandeth the prayer ſhall bee read vpon the Booke, If I haue called now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, where it is reade,</hi> It were no vnconſtancie to ſay now, there is commaundement. But in deede I doe not remember I haue euer reade any ſuch commaundement. But now you boaſt of your gaines by this confeſſion, ſaying that I graunt then there is no warrant. Lay all my words
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19054:54"/>
together, and yee may put your gaine in your eye, and ſee neuer the worſe. I ſet downe firſt of all that it is great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datitie, to affirme that there is no warrant of the word, for read prayer, ſeeing there be ſundrie teſtimonies to warrant the ſame, as I haue ſhewed: for the Lord preſcribed a forme of bleſſing, and commaunded the Prieſts ſo to bleſſe <hi>Num. 6.</hi> He preſcribed a forme of prayer for the people at the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the firſt fruites, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vſe it <hi>Deutr. 26</hi> The Pſalme for the ſabaoth was commaunded to bee ſong, the Pſalme 22. was to bee ſong euerie morning, and theſe they were tied vnto by expreſſe commaundement, though not to the booke, becauſe it is more commendable to haue them by heart. And the Lorde dooth not tye a man to that which is leſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable. This is the ſumme of that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which I vſed, from whence there is warrant to followe a preſcript forme. Maſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> vrgeth this, if there be no commaundement, then there is no warrant: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it to bee inconſtancie to ſay there is no commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reade praying, and yet ſome warrant for it by the word. I haue anſwered, that God tied the Prieſts and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto ſome preſcript formes, though not preciſelie to the booke. And though that were legall, and no ſuch comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to tie men of neceſſitie: now yet it ſheweth the thing to be holie and lawfull. Further I adde, if wee reſpect the matter as we ſay in the <hi>Theſe,</hi> or for a generalty there is no commandement: for then it ſhould bee of neceſſitie and not for conueniencie. But if we regarde it in the <hi>Hypotheſe</hi> for circumſtances in particularitie, there is commaundement: as thus, God hath commaunded thoſe thinges too bee done which ſerue as helpes for edification, or be moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uient. Then where the ſtate of anie man, or the ſtate of the aſſemblies is ſuch, as that preſcript forme of prayer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient and needefull for edification, there it is commanded. Now let the reader obſerue againe your words, which are that al our miniſters muſt leaue reading their ſtincted praiers vpon the booke, or elſe ſtand vnder Gods wrath, and all that ſo praye with them. Maſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> complaineth of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19054:55"/>
great iniury, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I gather from his words, that he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all Churches, becauſe hee knoweth that is a matter ſufficient alone to bewray the wickednes of <hi>Browniſme.</hi> Now if all our Miniſters which pray vpon the booke, and the people, that pray with them ſtand vnder the wrath of God for this thing, then cannot they be the Church of God: for GOD loueth his Church; and all Churches haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript formes of prayer which their Miniſters vſe: therfore they all ſtand vnder Gods wrath. But they doo it ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, will he ſay; and ſo (ſay I) did all our Churches, vntill his papers came abroad, and manie haue not as yet ſeene them: and ſome that haue ſeene them are not perſwaded, and ſo are ignorant ſtill. The next thing ye deale with, is the Argument which I drawe from the ſinging Pſalmes vpon the booke: it is ſo cleere they did ſing them vpon the booke, that the <hi>Browniſt</hi> himſelfe cannot denie it. It is alſo moſt manifeſt they did ſing them (as hee alſo now confeſſeth) to God, for ſo are we commaunded in many places, ſing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God. Then further he that offereth vp praiſe to God reading, it cannot be gainſaide, but that he offereth vp a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſacrifice to God reading. Yea praiſe is one parte of prayer: and it is as hard a thing to ſpeake praiſes to God vpon the booke, as to craue by petitions vpon the booke, and as ſpirituall a worke; and I may ſay a more high ſeruice: where is then that groſſe fantaſie of Maſter <hi>Greenewood,</hi> which becauſe reading is one thing; and ſpeaking to God is another, ſaith a man cannot both read and ſpeake to God at once. He cannot ſay <hi>O my God when he readeth, but O my booke why art thou ſo euill printed?</hi> I argue if the people of God in olde time, did both reade the Pſalmes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the booke, and ſpeake vnto the Lord at the ſame inſtant: how ſhould it not now bee both poſſible and lawfull, for to ſpeake vnto God in praiers while one readeth? Hée ſaieth, I denie your Argument. I ſay that is not ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the Argument: let vs therefore ſée the reaſons of the deniall. Admitte that ſinging were a part of praier (ſayeth he) yet dooth it not follow that all praier may bee read vpon
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19054:55"/>
the booke: we muſt take this vpon your bare word, at leaſt ſuch as will, may beléeue yée. I ſtand to affirme that one part of praier is as ſpirituall a worke as another; thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I alſo affirme, that if one part may bee read vppon the booke, and no turning the worke of the ſpirite into an Idoll, no ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nting the ſpirite, no quenching the ſpirit, no Idolatrie. no hindrance, but that hee which readeth may ſpeake vnto God: it may be ſo in any other part. And let vs ſee what hee will bee able to diſprooue this withall? But hee ſaieth I ſpeake like an ignorant man, to ſay that ſinging is praier, becauſe they be two diuers actions and exerciſes of our faith. The one neuer read for the other, nor ſaide to be a parte of the other, throughout the Scriptures, but are plainelie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, <hi>As I will praye with the Spirite, I will pray with vnderſtanding, I will ſing with the ſpirit, I will ſing with vnderſtanding,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> I anſwer you could no where more vntimelie accuſe mee of ignorance, then where your owne ſpeech in this and that which followeth next, is patched vp with errors, almoſt as thick as the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vpon a beggars cloake. And for anſwere I ſay, firſt, that Saint Paul dooth diſtinguiſh them there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not onelie becauſe the verie ſinging it ſelfe is not praier, no more then reading or ſpeaking: but alſo that there bee manie praiers which are not ſong, and manie Pſalmes and ſongs, which are no formes of praier; nor the ſpéech directed to God: a prayer that is no pſalme is neuer called a pſalme, nor any reaſon why it ſhould: but a Pſalme that is a praier, is called both a Pſalme and a praier. The Pſalme 86. is called <hi>Tephillah</hi> a praier, and conſiſteth of ſundrie petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Pſalme 90. is ſo called, being the praier of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Pſalme 102. is called <hi>Tephillah leaaui,</hi> the praier for the poore, when hee is in perplexitie, and powreth foorth his meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the Lord. The people praying for Chriſts Kingdome did vſe to ſay, <hi>Hoſanna, Bleſſed is he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the name of the Lord. Pſal. 118.</hi> The Pſalme 50. and 119. with many other conta ne petitions, almoſt in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery verſe, which if a man did pray or deſire them earneſtly

ſinging, it was no Idolatrie: ſinging I graunt is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led praier, but men might ſing Pſalmes to God, and were commanded, which contained praiſes and petitions: but they were giuen to the Church, to be ſong or read in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of praier (ſaith he) but denieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this was to be done pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He not only confeſſeth they were to ſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto God, but alſo ſaith the Lord keep me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch an error, as to denie that: &amp; yet eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion falleth into as groſe a matter. for what can bee more abſurd, than that a man ſhould vtter and ſpeake euen vnto God that which is a prayer and yet might not pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as when out of the <hi>Pſalm. 118.</hi> praying for the kingdome of Chriſt, they cried <hi>Hoſanna, bleſſed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord:</hi> or when for ſome ſpeciall benefite the whole Church was to ſing prayſe to God, and had a preſcript forme deliuered vnto them: were they to mocke with God, and not to ſpeak prayſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him indeede from the heart and with chearefulnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or did God commaund them to doe two things which cannot bee done at once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or wil any deny that many in ſinging, (though the ſinging it ſelfe be not praying) doe giue hearty thankes to God where thankſgiuing is expreſſed, and craue earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they vtter petitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Maſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> doth grieuouſly complaine of me for doing him foule wrong in ſaying he denieth that the Pſalmes are to be ſung to God. And what other thing in effect doth he vtter here, when hee ſaith they were not to vtter the wordes of a Pſalme to God praying? But I willſet downe his firſt words which are theſe. The ſame may be ſayde for the hundreth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Pſalme: for although ſome haue taken it as a prayer of the Prophet when he was in affliction, yet may I graunt with you to be taken in the future tenſe, and auoyd that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition you would fall into, for if it had beene giuen vnto the Church to haue beene read as a prayer vnto God, it ſhould haue beene ſaide, <hi>O Lord heare our prayer, and let our crie come vnto thee.</hi> And therefore it is manifeſt that this Pſalme was giuen to the Iſralites in time of their captiuitie at <hi>Babylon,</hi> or ſome other ſuch calamitie, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19054:56"/>
and inſtruct them how to ſettle themſelues, and powre foorth their prayers before the Lord. But howe will you prooue that the people were to ſay ouer theſe wordes vnto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for wee may ſee the like by <hi>Habbacuc,</hi> preſcribing the people a forme of prayers to comfort themſelues, and deliuered it to be ſung in the aſſemblies. Moreouer after manie other wordes maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> ſayth thus: And that ſinging of Pſalmes is no part of prayer we may ſee by the exhortation which the Apoſtle vſeth to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſaying <hi>Speake vnto your ſelues in Pſalmes and Hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs:</hi> And to the <hi>Colloſ.</hi> where it is ſayde <hi>Let the word of God dwel in ye plenteouſly in al wiſdome teaching &amp; admoniſhing your ſelues in pſalmes &amp; hymnes and ſpiritual ſongs.</hi> And further we reade that Chriſt our Sauiour did giue thanks and then ſing a Pſalme after the inſtitution of the Lords Supper: for that ſinging is a reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſelues, and inſtructing our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Now let the reader iudge, by comparing that which I haue written in my former booke with theſe words of his, whether I or he be the godles man which dealeth by vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable ſlaunders, and with much euil conſcience. Maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> denying the vſe of preſcript forme when wee ſpeake vnto God, and I alleadging the Pſalmes, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth how I wil prooue that the people were to ſay ouer thoſe wordes vnto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And after as you ſee to prooue that the wordes were not to be vttered or ſaid ouer to God praying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he alleageth the ſayings of <hi>Paule, Speaking to your ſelues and inſtructing your ſeluesin Pſalmes and Hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs,</hi> leauing out in both places the latter ende of the ſentence of <hi>ſinging to the Lord.</hi> Now when I haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the verie wordes of ſome Pſalmes were to be ſaid ouer to God, becauſe the ſcripture is cleare in many places, <hi>Sing Pſalmes to God, ſing prayſes to God, &amp;c.</hi> and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with denying that the Pſalmes are to be ſung to God contrarie to ſuch expreſſe commandement, and blamed him for leauing out the parte of the ſentence which maketh againſt him, he crieth ſhame vpon me. But maſter <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:19054:57"/>
it is the light of Gods word, and the waight thereof which doth preſſe ye, and cutteth downe all vngodly fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and not I. You confeſſe now, becauſe the ſcripture is plaine, that the Pſalmes were to be ſung to God, and yet ye did aſke how I would prooue the people were to ſay ouer the words. Then it followeth that the verie preſcript forms of wordes were to be ſaide ouer to God by your confeſſion, which is the whole matter that I haue ſtoode to prooue. And now chuſe whether you will denie that Pſalmes were to be ſung to God, or confeſſe that thoſe verie wordes of the Pſalmes and the preſcript formes were to be ſaid ouer vnto him in ſinging.</p>
            <p>What will he ſay now? This he will ſay, that they were in thoſe words to be ſong vnto God, but not praying: for he ſaith I muſt proue the Church did vſe to reade the pſalmes. for praying, I wonder how a man can ſpeake to God the ſentences which are praiers, and not praying. Againe I would haue any <hi>Browniſt</hi> ſhew mee what ſpeach wee can haue to God which is not praier: if he ſay a man dooth ſpeak to God in giuing him thankes and praiſe, in acknowleging his benefites, in aſcribing vnto him all wiſdome, power, glorie, goodnes, bountifulnes, faithfulnes, and mercie. A man dooth ſpeake to God, when hee confeſſeth his ſinnes, when he complaineth of the iniuries and wrongs of others: I confeſſe, and I ſay withall, that they be all of them parts of praier. Why dooth a man giue thankes and praiſe, and mention Gods benefits; but to ſupport his faith, and hope that he ſhall receiue further, and to moue the Lord to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtill good vnto him, or ſuch like? Why doo we ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of his glorious power, wiſdome, mercie and trueth, but that our faith and praier dooth reſt vpon thoſe pillers? Why doo we confeſſe our ſinnes, but as intreating for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and what doo we rehearſe the vniuſt outrage of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, but to procure his iuſt defence and protection: But hee demandeth what this maketh for reading praiers framed by men: I anſwer to the ſame effect which I haue euer done, that this is one of the pooreſt cauilles that may
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19054:57"/>
be among a thouſand. We reaſon not about the matter of praiers, but about the reading: for if the matter bee corrupt and naught, the pronouncing or the reading cannot make it better. If the matter be erronious, it is no more authentick pronounced, then read: if it be pure and good pronounced, the reading cannot hurt it, or make it vnpure. The reading it ſelfe is not vnpure when we ſpeake to God: for then ſhould not the Pſalmes haue béen ſong vpon the booke vnto him. Who is ſo ſenceles then as not to ſée this concluſion to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to vtter a preſcript forme of words, in a Pſalme when one ſpeaketh to God is no ſinne. Therefore to followe a preſcript forme of words in any godly praier, when one prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is not ſinne; for where ſhall we finde the ſinne? If it be in following a preſcript forme, it ſhould haue béen vnlawfull to followe it in the Pſalmes. If it be in the matter, becauſe there bee errors in all mens writings; and therefore to bee caſt foorth: then I ſay the errors, and not the reading is in the fault, and for which only there muſt be the caſting forth, and ſo we muſt caſt foorth the praiers of the preachers. To his next words, I anſwer that it is not the repeating ouer the ſame godlie petitions againe euery day, that maketh it the ſacrifice of fooles, but when men doo it of cuſtome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith and feruent affection: for if a man with faith and zeale pray euery day the ſame praier to God, it is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The reſt of his words are not worth the repeating, and yet he concludeth moſt falſly that read praier hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Gods word.</p>
            <p>The next Argumentis this, <hi>We may not in the worſhip of God receiue any tradition, which bringerh our libertie into bondage: read praier vpon commandement is a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that dooth bring our libertie into bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt this I oppoſed that <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, and our Sauiour gaue preſcript formes of praiers, and if the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry following a preſcript forme impoſed by commandement, be ſo deteſtable a thing, how are not they charged with this heinous ſinne? He anſwereth that here is a great ſtorme, and yet nothing but winde; doo ye not know the wind may
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19054:58"/>
be ſo great, as to blow downe the houſe vpon your head, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when the blaſt of truth commeth againſt your buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which ſtandeth vpon the rotten pillers of errours. The counterfaite zeale of <hi>Cayphas</hi> againſt the trueth, ought not to ſtay any man from being earneſt for the truth. But now to the matter, your woonted ſong was heretofore when ſuch preſcript formes were alleadged, prooue that thoſe wordes were to be ſaide ouer to God: but now being conuinced, and confeſſing that ſome Pſalmes were ſong to God, and for feare leaſt bidding mee prooue againe that the preſcript forme was followed, when they ſpake to GOD, I ſhould againe charge ye openly to denie the ſinging of Pſalmes to God, which I haue ſhewed yee doe couertly, ye ſeeke another ſhift, and ſay your <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition (which is that I ſtand to diſprooue) ſpeaketh of the reading for praying, and not of the forme of prayer. This is poore ſtuffe, ſeeing we reaſon about preſcript forme and reading the ſame, praying. I do not ſay that the reading it ſelfe is praying: but I haue prooued, that they went together, and whether there were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement to followe the preſcript formes or not, in the bleſſing, for the Prieſtes to vſe. In the prayer preſcribed for the people to ſay at the offring the firſt fruites, and in ſome of the Pſalmes, whether it be not alſo lawful to ſay the Lords prayer praying, let wiſe men iudge. Nowe where as I ſaide the <hi>Browniſtes</hi> doe condemne all Churches by theſe three arguments againſt read prayers, Maiſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> at this is in no ſmall heate as his ſpeech doth ſhewe: for if hee coulde dippe his words tenne times deeper in gall, it appeareth hee woulde not ſpare. I truſt (ſaith he) your madneſſe will appeare vnto all men, the poyſon of Aſpes is vnder your tongue. But Maiſter <hi>Greenewood,</hi> If I haue ſaide the truth which is iuſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by your owne ſpeeches, your ſober minde is not to bee boaſted off. And if your ſentence include all Churches, what milke and honie doth flow from vnder your lippes? Heere is much a doe, this man layeth about him as if he were halfe madde: but that he is blindfolde, I could not eſcape ſome
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19054:58"/>
ſounde blowes. Here he hath vp the begger with his clappe diſh, and the Prieſt with his Maſſe booke, canueſing ouer the <hi>Paternoſter</hi> for their bellie. Here he ſaith I breath out my accuſtomed lies, ſlaunders, and raylings, calling them <hi>Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> here he deteſteth <hi>Donatus</hi> his hereſies: <hi>Browne,</hi> and the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> he ſaith are ours, hee willeth mee to remember who is the Father of ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes, when I ſay they condemne al reformed Churches, but becauſe my conſcience (as hee ſaith) did witneſſe I had wrongfullie charged him, and for him all true Chriſtians, I bring it in by neceſſarie conſequence. Now if the heate be any thing paſt heare a little what I ſaye, ſhewe that I haue any way ſlaundred ye, or rayled vpon yee, in that I haue termed you <hi>Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts:</hi> and let mee haue open ſhame among all men. I haue affirmed that the very pith of all your matter is from Maiſter <hi>Brownes</hi> bookes, conuince mée therein if yee can, I haue now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed that <hi>Browniſme</hi> and <hi>Donatiſme</hi> are all one: let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Browniſt</hi> in the land confute me. The theefe will not abide to be ſo called, but will ſay I defie all theeues: doth that cleare him when he liueth by theeuerie? what are you the better to ſay I deteſt the hereſies of <hi>Donatus,</hi> and yet holde all that he helde, and know not what ye ſay, nor what the hereſies of <hi>Donatus</hi> were, more then doth a poſt: ſhew openly that ye renounce thoſe thinges I haue noted to bée the furies of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> &amp; then yee may crie out that ye are ſlaundred.</p>
            <p>And now for condemning al Churches, will ye denie that which is concluded by neceſſarie conſequence from your words? Is that againſt conſcience which is brought in by neceſſarie conſequence? Ye would ſeeme to make light of it in this reſpect, that a multitude is not to bee followed to doo euill, when ye condemne all Churches: but yet it doth ſting ye ſo neere, that by no meanes ye can abide to heare of it. Thus I did reaſon, and thus I reaſon ſtill without any witneſſe of conſcience againſt me. You affirme preſcript formes of prayer brought into the publike aſſemblies, to bée
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19054:59"/>
the changing the worke of the ſpirit into an Idoll, a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion breaking Chriſtian libertie, and therefore a thing moſt deteſtable, a dead letter which doth quench the ſpirit; but all reformed Churches haue preſcript forme of prayer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: therefore yee condemne all Churches. I am glad your booke may bee ſeene of all men, that they may iudge the ſoundnes of that anſwere by which ye would cleere your ſelfe. Ye cannot goe from your firſt words, they be ſpread in the hands of ſo many, but ye ſhould ſhame your ſelfe. Ye replie therefore againe, that the true Churches might erre in this, and yet remaine Churches of God. This is ſtrange that ignorance ſhould excuſe men that worſhip an Idoll in ſtead of God, that take away the Chriſtian libertie from the conſciences of men, and doo that which is moſt deteſtable. What doo the Papiſts more than theſe? or what can they bee charged withall which is worſe than that which is moſt deteſtable? And haue ye not ſet downe now in this your booke in replying vpon the ſecond Argument, that all our Miniſters muſt leaue reading their ſtinted prayers, or elſe ſtand vnder Gods wrath and all that pray with them? How are the Miniſters and people of other Churches priuiledged from ſtanding vnder Gods wrath, hauing read prayers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed leiturgies, and as you terme them ſtinted prayers? or tell me, are they the Churches of God that ſtand vnder his wrath? Now remember who is the father of lyes. Well, your meaning was not to condemne the Churches, nor to meddle with them. Why then doo ye giue ſuch ſentence of condemnation which reacheth vnto them? Tel me but this, is there any <hi>Browniſt</hi> which is a diſciple, and giueth credite vnto ye in this matter, that read prayer is moſt deteſtable, and that ſuch as ioyne in it ſtand vnder Gods wrath, which yet durſt ioyne himſelfe or might ioyne himſelfe vnto any aſſemblie in the world, euen the moſt reformed? Tell me ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you or any other chiefe <hi>Browniſt,</hi> will ſay they may pray with any aſſembly where they follow a preſcript forme? If ye dare not ſay this (I meane that ye would counſell men to ioyne with a Church that hath read prayer) but ſay they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19054:59"/>
muſt reprooue and condemne it, and if it were not redreſſed forſake them: then bee alſo aſhamed ſo furiouſlie to crie out vpon me, which ſpeake nothing herein, that I ſay ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all churches, but that which all indifferent men muſt néedes ſée your owne wordes and doctrine doe vpholde. As for your bitter accuſations vpon no ſhewe I leaue them: and whereas ye require that if I haue any ſparkle of grace, I would procure that ye might decide the trueth with other Churches. I anſwere, that if ye had any ſparke of ſober wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ye could not with ſuch condition lay that vpon me, which ye knowe not howe vnable I am to performe. You ſay you might iuſtly be called an Anabaptiſt, if you ſhoulde reaſon thus, Impoſing of mens writings to be read for praying, is an heinous ſinne, therefore they that vſe it are no Church. Haue ye ſaid no more, but that it is an hainous ſinne? Haue you forgotten all your former ſayings of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, bondage breaking Chriſtian libertie, moſt deteſtable, ſtanding vnder Gods wrath? I hold him no <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> nor <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> which from ſuch ſpéeches concludeth no true Church. For I neuer heard that the true Church doth ſtand vnder Gods wrath. The next wordes are ſore; <hi>Abaddon</hi> is the father of ſuch Prophets, ſaith Maiſter <hi>Greenewood,</hi> becauſe I ſay the <hi>Browniſts</hi> maintaine ſuch a fréedome as that will haue nothing impoſed by commaundement. I pray ye tell me whether you be one of thoſe which ſet out the brief ſumme of the profeſſion? And when I had written againſt it, I would knowe if ye were one that made the defence, or approoued the ſame? Did yee not approoue of the anſwers that goe vnder the name of <hi>Henrie Barrow?</hi> Impoſed is put for an argument by it ſelfe in thoſe writings, and ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a figure. Could the very word impoſed be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by it ſelfe, if any impoſing by commaundement bee lawfull in Gods worſhip? If the ciuill Magiſtrates haue power but to reuiew the lawes of Chriſt, and to mooue men or ſtirre them vp to the more diligent keeping of the ſame, may they then impoſe by commaundement? And as you ſpeake here of that which is not onely receiued, but alſo by
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19054:60"/>
commaundement, as though there were great waight in the words, by commaundement. I pray ye tell me then what force ye repoſe in the words impoſed, and by commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when ye oppoſe them againſt Chriſtian freedome? Tell me alſo whether yee denie not that any Canons and conſtitutions made in Synods, in matters variable, are to be impoſed by commandement? If they be, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that you <hi>Browniſts</hi> when yee crie out againſt Church gouernment as it is in <hi>England,</hi> ſpeake in generall againſt Canons? And a little after in this your booke, ye denie all power of making lawes in things indifferent, terming it an adding to Gods word, and alleaging againſt it the extreame curſe of God. I graunt the Churches power is limitted by the word in making ſuch lawes: and ſo is the power of Princes. There hath béen much ſayd alreadie touching the Lords Praier and other preſcript formes in the Scriptures: but yet here come in newe reaſons (if I may ſo call them) which are voide of reaſon. <hi>Houtos</hi> is the ſame that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>Coh,</hi> after this manner. I anſwere that this hath béen dealt in before, where ye muſt vnſay ſomewhat againe, or elſe the words of the Scripture now written are not the words of the Lord, but the like. Further, becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>when ye pray,</hi> if he willed we ſhould ſay ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words, then ſhould we euer when we pray, ſay them. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that reſpecting the rules for matters, when ye pray, when is as much as to ſay whenſoeuer ye pray, becauſe we may not depart from thoſe matters conteined in the general petitions. But if we reſpect withall the preſcript forme of words, there is a double conſideration to be had: for in them ſelues they bee moſt excellent, perfect and full, and ſo brieflie doo containe the whole ſumme and ſubſtance of all thinges which we ought to craue of God, as that nothing is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. But our mind is not able ſo largelie or vnto ſuch depth at one inſtant to ſpread or extend it ſelfe in deſire, as to bee mindfull of euery particular therein conteined. And alſo we are more mooued, as ſeuerall matters of néede doo preſſe vs to craue them particularlie. Hereupon it doth followe, that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19054:60"/>
as on the one part, it were agreat iniurie and hindrance that any man ſhould binde vs, when any particular néede vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, to begge reliefe onelie in the generall forme which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth many things, and not ſuffer vs to expreſſe the very particulars and ſingulars: ſo on the other part, to binde vs alwaies in ſuch ſort to the ſeuerall particulars, that we may not at all vſe the generals, is very abſurd, and a diſgrace to thoſe moſt excellent petitions. For by this it muſt needes followe, that I may not ſay, <hi>Let thy Kingdome come:</hi> or <hi>forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgiue them, that treſpas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs: vntill the Browniſts</hi> diſprooue this, he is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict. For if I may vſe one petition of the generall heads when I pray, I may vſe anie one; if any one, then all.</p>
            <p>The next argument which is brought, is to this effect, that if we be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to ſay thoſe words, then ſhould we ſin in vſing any other forme, for thoſe being in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt forme, we are bound alwaies to bring the beſt ſacrifice we haue, or els we are accurſed. This reaſon I haue fully anſwered in that which went before, for I haue ſhewed in what reſpect, it is the moſt excellent &amp; abſolute forme, &amp; the beſt, and can by no meanes, without great abſurditie, yea wicked impie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, be reiected: &amp; withall what is neceſſarie and fit for vs.</p>
            <p>Now for concluſion, let the Reader iudge, whether I haue more need to leaue of, as he ſaith, <hi>my popiſh dreames,</hi> or he his ſpirituall fantaſies, I am farre from maintaining, that our Sauiour, or his Apoſtles did ſtint, or bynde men vnto certaine wordes which of neceſſitie they muſt vſe, and none other: but this is the thing which the <hi>Browniſtes</hi> muſt ioyne iſſue in with me, whether I may not pray ſaying, let <hi>thy kingdome come,</hi> or if I may ſo vſe the preſcript forme of wordes in one petition, whether I may not in any, and ſo in all? And heere let the Reader obſerue that Maiſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> crying out for freedome, complayning of a tradition that bringeth our libertie into bondage, hee doth him ſelfe take away freedome, and woulde lay a bondage vpon men, and vpon the Churches. For it is to lay a yoake of bondage when men will reſtraine that which God hath
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19054:61"/>
left free to bee vſed, as ſhalbe moſt conuenient and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for edification, as to follow a preſcript forme, or to reade praying. Among the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the time of the Law, God tied them to the Temple, and vnto certaine ſet howers for the Euening and Morning ſacrifice, but in this we are ſet free in the Goſpell. For I may lawfullie goe to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to heare the word and to be partaker of the Sacraments with the aſſemblie: and I may lawfullie frequent other places, where the publike worſhip is. The Churches may appoint the ſame howres for there meetings that were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, if it be conuenient, and they may appoint other if it ſhalbe more fitte hee that in theſe ſhall take away the freedome which is giuen to the Churches, doth lay a yoake of bondage. In like caſe preſcript forme of prayer to vſe praying, being an helpe to the weake, and a thing ſanctified of God, and left free to the Church as neede ſhall require, he that denieth that free vſe, doth lay a yoake of bondage. And ſo I charge Maiſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> here to doe.</p>
            <p>In the next place there were three Arguments of Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Greenewoods</hi> which I anſwered at once by denying the aſſumptions, and ſhewing the reaſons that moueth me, for in déede, he ſetteth downe ſome propoſitions: and out of them affirmeth that which is falſe, and ſo concludeth from thence another falſehood. It is his whole manner of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; if I ſet downe this propoſition, God is a ſpirit, it is moſt true: if I will now make ſuch an aſſumption as this, a bodelie ſubſtance cannot worſhip a ſpirite, this being moſt falſe: there will followe a falſe concluſion, which is that no man can worſhip God in bodie; he is now therefore to proue his aſſumptions, and before he commeth to it, he crieth out, ſtay and wonder, they are blinde and make blinde. Who be blinde and make blinde the <hi>Browniſts?</hi> This man hath ſome great thing in his minde, which hee ſéeth and dooth wonder, and now calleth vpon all other to ſtay, vntill hee hath vttered it, and ſo to wonder with him. Is there anie doctrine more ſpirituall (ſaieth hee) any more inculcated by the holie Ghoſt, then this acceſſe to God in the mediation of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19054:61"/>
Chriſt, &amp;c. I anſwer who dooth doubt of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I will ſay the propoſitions bee true and waightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: which I doo in deed, and thereby doo acknowledge that praier is a ſpirituall and Heauenlie thing, farre from the power of man to performe of himſelfe. Now Maſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> confeſſing I doo this, like as a great waue of the Sea commeth rowling and dooth in ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w, threaten to ouerwhelme all, but ſodainelie falleth of it ſelfe: So he ſwelling with the winde of his vanitie, crieth out ſtay and wonder, as if I ſhould be ouer whelmed with the ſtreame of his words, and by and by falleth of himſelfe, confeſſing that I allow the propoſitions: which in déede include the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of praier, and there is an end of his wonder. The firſt aſſumption, hee muſt prooue is that to reade vpon the booke when one prayeth is a quenching the ſpirite; for this he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth the ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul, Quench not the Spirite,</hi> when he hath ſet downe this, he addeth that to ſuppreſſe and leaue vnuttered the paſſions of our own heart, by the work of the Spirite, giuing vs cauſe of praier, and in ſteed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to reade another mans writing, he dooth not doubt will be founde and iudged of all that haue ſpirituall eyes to ſee a quenching of that grace. I anſwer to this, that the ſpéeches of the Scripture are moſt fit to vtter our paſſions by. And what haue yee brought, but the matter in queſtion? If wee reſpect ſuch as be not able ſo well to vtter: the ſpirituall eyes to ſée and iudge that to bee a quenching of the Spirite, are but the eyes of <hi>Browniſts.</hi> Therefore all his beggarlie ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils which follow, and which haue been anſwered before, are to be let paſſe as they come.</p>
            <p>The ſecond aſſumption to bee prooued is that it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ignorance to come with a booke. This is a lame ſacrifice, becauſe a man dooth knowe how to doe better and doth not; ſtil he would haue that graunted which is denied. For I ſay the booke is to helpe men to doo the better, which are in themſelues dull, and full of wants, and without helpe ſhould rather offer a lame ſacrifice. The third is for ſtriuing in praier, for which when hee hath ſpoken much of this ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19054:62"/>
which is not denied, for continuance and importuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; he imagineth that the whole matter is prooued, for this as hee would make vs beléeue, cannot bee effected vnles the Prieſt reade till he ſweate againe, with vaine repetitions. I might followe with many words in theſe and the reſt: but ſéeing he hath confeſſed, that the Pſalmes were to bee ſung vnto God, let him ſhew how the verie reading then can bée ſo grieuous a thing; for this the reader muſt conſider, that our queſtion is not about the matter of prayer, nor any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption by vaine repetitions or otherwiſe, nor about the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and vaine babling of ſuch as pray but of faſhion, but ſimplie of the reading, when one prayeth: which vntill he can prooue that diuers Pſalmes either were not vttered to God as praier, or that they did not reade them when they did ſing, he prooueth nothing, but deceiueth the ſimple with the ſight of true things which he ſpreadeth, and from which he draweth foorth ſuch falſe concluſions. I leaue to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but to compare his anſweres he maketh to the reſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching theſe arguments, and ſee if they make any thing for uim, and not rather againſt him.</p>
            <p>The next Argument is that, <hi>We muſt pray as neceſsitie</hi>

               <hi>requireth: but ſtinted praiers cannot be as neceſsitie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas I affirmed that there be things neceſſarie to be prayed for at all times and of all men: which indéed are the moſt things which wée are to begge of the Lord. Of theſe there may bee preſcript formes for all times: and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that fall out ſildome the praier is to be applied to the time, and neceſſitie. Here are large diſcourſes and ſuch as this Replier dooth much pleaſe himſelfe in, as a moſt ſpiritual man. This I take to be the drift of the whole that in praying to GOD, wee muſt come with féeling our wants, that ſo we may pray earneſtlie, which I doo yéeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as an vndoubted trueth. He holdeth it as a great abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that we ſhould want the ſame thing to morrow which wee doo to day, or that all congregations ſhould néed the ſame one day which they doo another. Hee is moſt fooliſh in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19054:62"/>
this and ſuch like obiections: for if I ſhould ſtand to followe particulars, there bee fewe things which we may not either for our ſelues or for our brethren at all aſſemblies begge of the Lord. If there be ſpeciall neceſſities, they are to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. The matter is cléere, I will not ſpend time about it, more than I haue in my former booke.</p>
            <p>But whereas the <hi>Browniſt</hi> doth obiect, that a preſcript forme doth ſhewe that men take vpon them to knowe mens ſecrets, which God alone doth knowe, it is moſt vaine and friuolous. The Scriptures doo ſhewe that we all ſtand in neede of the ſame thinges and euermore, being ſicke of one diſeaſe, though there may be ſome particular caſes wherein ſome haue their ſeuerall neede. And let him anſwer me now vnto this poynt: There be fiue or ſixe hundred in one flock, which come together to pray; if it be as you would beare vs in hand, that there is ſuch a variablenes in our needes, that to day our neceſſitie requireth one thing, to morrowe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: then euery particular man and woman hath ſeuerall wants, and is to pray for no more than they come with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent feeling off, how then ſhall the Miniſter frame his praier to fit them all? One ſhall ſay, this pertaineth not to me, how ſhall I pray? Another ſhall ſay, this or that toucheth not my eſtate. Many ſhal complaine that their ſeueral wants are not touched. Tell me Ma. <hi>Greenwood,</hi> or any <hi>Browniſt,</hi> doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Miniſter knowe what is in euery man? doth he know euerie man &amp; womans particular wants? He is to make the praier in which they are al to ioyne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, in euerie requeſt that he maketh. Or is your meaning y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euerie man and woman ſhall come vnto him before euerie aſſemblie, and make their ſtate knowne what their ſeuerall neede is? Or can the Miniſter beare in minde when he hath heard? Ye may ſee into what abſurdities blind fantaſie doth caſt men. Men are to pray for nothing but that which they feele the want of, and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to aſke, &amp; are fit to receiue. For theſe (ſaith the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi>) there can be no ſet forme. And I demaund whether the preacher doth know euery mans féeling, how they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; how fit to receiue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Will ye affirme this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or will ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19054:63"/>
that theſe groſſe fantaſies which yet you will father vpon Gods ſpirit, doo quite ouerthrowe all publike prayer? For if it bee ſinne for any to pray for more than he commeth with the preſent feeling off, if in the multitude the deſires are ſeuerall, if it bee vnpoſſible for the Miniſter to knowe them, and how the hearts bee prepared and affected, how ſhall he make prayer for them all? how ſhall they all ioyne with him in euerie requeſt? How much better is it to confeſſe that the moſt things which all are to pray for, and at all times are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uariable: and that men come not only to pray for that which they feele their neede in; but alſo to be ſtirred vp to pray for ſuch things as either they thinke not of, or be dull in. I muſt needes here lament the ſtate of our people which profeſſe the Goſpell, and cannot eſpie the groſſeneſſe of theſe thinges. When the aſſemblies doo méet, and holie petitions are made which men haue heard at euery meeting, they ought to bee as feruent in praying as the firſt time they heard them. For it is a groſſe wickednes in men not to bee mooued with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becauſe they haue often heard it, but accompt it ſtale: as we ſee mans minde coueteth ſtil that which is newe. If men haue not feeling it is their fault.</p>
            <p>Touching the faults in any Leiturgie, the queſtion is not betweene vs, which reaſon what ſhould be. That wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch I ſpake of the preachers not limitted in their praiers, I meane the prayers before and after their Sermons which they conceiue. That our Sauiour preſcribed no forme, I ſhewed the reaſon, that it is not a thing of neceſſitie, but to auoide inconuenience: neither are men tied to one forme in all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Againſt this the <hi>Browniſt</hi> replying, biddeth me ſtand to this, and ſaith I will goe from it in the next argument. I ſay, all the <hi>Browniſts</hi> vnder heauen ſhall neuer be able with force of reaſon to driue me from it. He firſt oppoſeth, that if I ſay it be at all times neceſſarie, then the Teſtament is not perfect. How can I ſay it is at all times neceſſarie, when I ſay it is not of neceſſitie? Chriſts Teſtament is moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie perfect: but yet all things touching comelines, order, and conueniencie, which are variable and may bee changed,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19054:63"/>
are not expreſſelie mentioned. And that is one chiefe thing whereby the <hi>Browniſts</hi> doo ſeduce many a ſimple man. For this <hi>Browniſt</hi> doth confeſſe that there bee things contained in the generall rules of the Scripture, which are not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but he will not haue any of thoſe things variable, that is, ſuch as may be for good cauſe altered. For thus he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth, <hi>I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it bee a part of Gods worſhip, and all times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, then is it neceſſarie: and if it be not neceſſarie, put</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſuch conueniencie in your cornered cappe, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſſe.</hi> And a little after, <hi>but you graunt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is not of neceſsitie, therefore it is not commanded in particular, nor conteined in any generall rule.</hi> Thus may we ſee, that he holdeth there is nothing in matters of conuenience or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in Gods worſhip, which is not of neceſſitie. The ground of his reaſon is this: If it be either expreſſed in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or contained in any generall rule, it is commaunded of GOD, and man hath not authoritie to alter Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, therefore it is neceſſarie. I grant that matters of conueniencie are commaunded of GOD by the generall rules, and that men may not take authoritie ouer Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. I ſay therefore the Church doth ſinne either of ignorance or of negligence, when it faileth in matters of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which ſhould ſerue for edification. But herein the Browniſt ſheweth himſelfe moſt abſurdly ignorant, that he will haue that which is commanded to be of neceſſitie at all times. For that he may not winde out here with ſhift, as his manner is when any groſſe thing vttered by him is detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Let the reader obſerue his words, and he ſhall ſée plainly he reaſoneth for a neceſſitie at all times. For he ſaith, <hi>If it be a part of Gods worſhip, and at all times conuenient, then is it neceſſarie.</hi> And to manifeſt that he holdeth it all times conuenient: ſaying, <hi>if it be not neceſſarie, put ſuch conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie into your cornered cappe.</hi> And againe hée ioyneth commanded in Gods word and neceſſarie at all times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And a little after he ſaith, <hi>Whatſoeuer is commanded either in particular or in neceſſarie collection from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rules, are of neceſsitie to be obeyed, and not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:19054:64"/>
This I note to ſtop his euaſion: for many matters of circumſtance ſeruing for conueniencie and order, are fit at ſome times in ſome places, and for ſome perſons, and ſo by the commaundement of GOD then to be vſed, who willeth that all things be done comelie, in order, and to edification. Now, as the times do varie with the circumſtances of place, of perſons, and of other occaſions, the ſame things which were conuenient may become inconuenient, and ſo not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie at all times, as the blinde <hi>Browniſt</hi> dooth beare in hand, but to be altered. As for example, in the time of peace it is moſt conuenient that the aſſemblies ſhould meete in ſome Temple or Church built for the purpoſe: the Church is then to ordeine that it may bee ſo. In the times of warre and cruell perſecution when the enemies raunge about and rage: it may bee farre more ſafe for feare of intrapping, to meete in the woods, or ſecret places. Kneeling is the fitteſt geſture of the bodie when men in earneſt prayer are to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord: the Church is to commaund it where it may fitlie be done: but if the aſſemblies be driuen to meet in ſuch places as the ground being wet, and through the trampling of their feete doth become myrie, it is inconuenient that the multitude ſhould bee compelled to kneele in the myre: and therefore the former ordinance is now changed. I might runne through a number of particulars, but theſe are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to declare what a learned Deuine maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> is, and how perfect a ſpirit doth guide his penne. He deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alſo full wiſely, <hi>whether wee doo not hold it of neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſeeing men are excommunicate, and depoſed for not obſeruing it: or as ſome verie ignorantlie vſe to ſay, if it be a thing indifferent, why is it not left indifferent for men to vſe or not to vſe?</hi> I anſwere, that which is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, God commaundeth it ſhall be done when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient and for edification, and therefore when the Church doth appoynt or ordeine it, rightly he that breaketh it, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie breaketh the commandement of God. And ſo on the other ſide, when it falleth out not to be conuenient, and the Church dooth alter it, hee that will now obſerue it with a reſiſting
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19054:64"/>
minde doth like wiſe offend againſt the rule of Gods word. I neuer doubted but that by ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſary conſequence it is to be drawen from the doctrine of the ſcriptures, that prayer is to be made before and after the word preached, but I ſpeake of a commaundement in expreſſe wordes: therefore the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are cited here by the <hi>Browniſt</hi> to no purpoſe. And all the reſt of his words that follow are either in matters wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we agree, or ſuch as he collectetth from his owne igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and which are anſwered before.</p>
            <p>The next argument is, <hi>Read prayers were deuiſed by Antichriſt and maintaine ſuperſtition and Idole miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Browniſt,</hi> if he would at all ſpeak to the purpoſe ſhoulde prooue that the very reading a prayer when one prayeth is the deuiſe of Antichriſt, maintaineth ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; an Idole miniſtrie. But he flieth &amp; dealeth about the matter of leiturgies, ſaying: he hath heard, the Pope woulde haue approoued ours, if it might be receiued in his name. If ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Greenwoods</hi> newes from <hi>Rome</hi> were true which hee heard, the matter were not great, for the Pope will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the Lords prayer, the commaundements and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the faith, but he wil expound them as it pleaſeth him. The Pope alſo to wind in himſelf, wil approoue in ſhew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which he miſliketh, ſo they be not directly againſt his crowne and dignitie. And it is to be conſidered that the controuerſies betweene vs and the Papiſts are not about the matters which we are to begge in prayer. There is no likelyhood that the Pope made ſuch offer, becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth we holde in the ſubſtance and grounds of the faith, that which quite ouerthroweth him: but if he did, men may ſee by theſe things which I haue noted, that maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> doth but ſhift and trifle. He confeſſeth leiturgies were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichriſt, and yet ſaith he was the deuiſer. See the grauitie of this man: he is ſore afraide that hee ſhould here againe be ſaid to condemne all Churches becauſe they haue read prayer: and therfore he ſaith his arguments are falſely wreſted. Anſwere your ſelfe then, and tell vs what ye holde
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19054:65"/>
them which receiue the deuiſe of Antichriſt. Why crie yee not out of the marke of the beaſt? It is a pitifull thing to ſee in what a caſe the <hi>Browniſt</hi> is: For he wil not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the Churches; and yet after he hath ſet foorth what leitur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie is, and affirmed that the new Teſtament is Chriſts lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie: he alleageth that they be accurſed that adde thereto; and holdeth preſcript forme of prayer an adding. Let him now be aſked: is the curſe layd vpon the true Churches? he will ſay no. Then preſcript forme is either no adding to Chriſts Teſtament, or elſe they be vnder the curſe that vſe it. He ſaith leiturgies are another goſpel. Then all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue receiued another goſepl. The wordes that follow haue bin anſwered before. Where I ſayd there would ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie inconueniences growe for want of preſcript forme of publike prayer. After he hath ſet downe that Chriſt is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect law giuer, and that the word of God is ſufficient, he tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it blaſphemie to ſay there would be inconueniences without leiturgies: then all the Churches committe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, whether doe ye yet condemne them or not? This is from his groſenes which doth not ſe that Chriſts Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is perfect, and yet there are things commaunded in generall rules which are variable, as I haue before ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed for circumſtances of time, place, perſons, ſitting, kneeling, &amp;c. He ſaith there can be no particular lawes made without breaking the lawe of God, as though the Church were not to ſee what in theſe is fit and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vpon euerie occaſion and time, and for that time to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the ſame: But euerie man to doe as he ſhall like, or ſhal take the generall rule of order and decencie, for men will not agree: this is from rules of order to drawe confuſion. Now this great deuine ſaith I haue made a faire hande in affirming leiturgies to be but a matter of order, or conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie for edification. Seeing as hee ſaith, it is all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip we haue: this commeth from him that hath the beautie of Sion, as he boaſteth: which the inchaunters of Egipt cannot iudge of. This commeth from him that with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes hath the cloude betweene them and vs, and the pillar
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19054:65"/>
of fire before them as he ſpeaketh in the next wordes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſay the preſcript forme and the reading are but for order, he concludeth that I confeſſe the prayer is but a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of order or conueniencie: ye ſay I haue made a faire hand. But I tell ye maſter <hi>Greenwood,</hi> if ye ſhould goe into the Schooles and reaſon ſo in earneſt, the young boyes would be readie to hiſſe ye foorth as a <hi>non proficiens,</hi> and howe faire hand ſhould you make then? they will not beleeue ye haue it from your pillar of fire, but out of that dark cloud of your ignorance which is betweene your ſelfe and the light of the trueth. Now wheras I ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church hath power to ordain according to the word of God, &amp; to appoint ſuch orders in matters of circumſtance, about publike prayer, preaching of the worde, and adminiſtring of the Sacraments, as ſhall moſt fitly ſerue for edification: and then theſe orders being eſtabliſhed by publike authoritie the diſcipline and cenſures of the Church are to driue men to the obſeruation of the ſame that ſtubbornely break them. Here the poore <hi>Browniſt</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth open himſelfe againe to be as blinde as a beetle: he will needes haue it to be papiſticall mudde, and that I am in an Apoſtacie. Becauſe there can as (he ſaith) no other lawes be made in matters of circumſtance, than Chriſt himſelfe hath made: that to ordaine lawes in the Church is to plead for vnwritten verities: and to make the law of God vnſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. It is an adding to the word of God, which is execrable pride. All the Popes trinkets might bee brought in by the ſame ground. This is the foundation of Poperie, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſtrie, to giue libertie to make lawes in the worſhip of God. And by your iudgement which would haue men driuen to obſerue them, <hi>our Sauiour Chriſt was an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſticall Schiſmatike that would not himſelfe nor his diſciples obey the traditions of the Elders.</hi> Thus ſpeaketh this <hi>Browniſt.</hi> But what beaſtlie ignorance doth he bewray and that in ſundrie poynts? and with what horrible things in his blinde furie, doth he charge all Churches withall? For firſt when he ſaith that for matters of order and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there can be no other lawes made of them, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt hath made: he ſeeth not the difference betweene the giuing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19054:66"/>
generall rules of charitie, of come liues, and order, which ſerue for edification that are to be followed in making lawes touching matters in themſelues merely indifferent, and the very particular lawes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues that are ſo to be made. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if it be true which he ſaith the matters of order and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance are not variable, but ſtand fixed as inuiolable lawes of Chriſt in the particulars to be obſerued, which is falſe, ſeeing theſe circumſtances are no part of Gods worſhip: As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Kingdome of God is not meate and drinke, &amp;c.</hi> but as handmaids, to attend vpon it, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne it; and ſo are vſed and not vſed, as occaſion ſerueth. I haue ſhewed this before in ſome particulars, as that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies are in time of peace gathered in temples, and fixed places and open, in time of perſecution and tumult in the fields, in woods, and ſecret places which they change, and at the commandement of the paſtors and gouernours: the wiſe reader may conſider the like not onelie for kneeling and ſuch like, but in many other. And we ſée that the Apoſtles themſelues did decree ſome things for the time, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward were to bee altered, when the occaſion was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as namelie to auoide giuing offence to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weak Iewes which ſtuck in the ceremonies of the lawe: they made this decree <hi>Act. 15.</hi> That the gentiles ſhould abſteine from blood and from ſtrangled. We doo not now obſerue this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Apoſtles, neither are we to obſerue it, ſéeing the occaſion is remooued for which it was made.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if there be no lawes to be made in matters of circumſtance, how ſhal the flockes knowe what to follow or to obſerue where the paſtors ſhall diſſent and varie in iudgement? Sall not ſome be rent into one part, and ſome into another? Now when hee ſaith this is to pleade for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written verities, to make the Lawe of God vnſufficient, to adde to the word, alleaging thoſe Scriptures, which ſhew how curſed a thing that is: hee dooth but ignorantlie abuſe thoſe Scriptures, and wickedlie ſeduce the ſimple ſorte of men. For thoſe Scriptures are againſt the adding of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine precepts and lawes to be kept as parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19054:66"/>
to binde the conſcience, to ſéeke righteouſnes, and the forgiuenes of ſinnes, or the merite of eternall life in them, or againſt ſuch rules of gouernement, as God hath ſet to bee perpetuall. This is againſt the perfection of the word, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtian libertie, and in the chiefe things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Gods worſhip, againſt the ground and foundation of our faith: and ſo a thing moſt deteſtable and accurſed, which our ſauiour alſo and his Apoſtles refuſed iuſtlie to obſerue with the blinde Phariſies. But now where the <hi>Browniſt</hi> hath his eyes ſo daſeled with that pillar of fire which hee ſaieth they haue before them, that he cannot perceiue that to make and conſtitute lawes in matters of circumſtance for comelines, and order according to the generall rules of the Scripture and not to binde the conſcience, is no adding to the word, nor mixing Gods worſhip with mans inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he is much to be pittied. And doubtles before this pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of fire bee remooued, which is not the heauenlie light of Gods ſpirite, but a frantick preſumption, by which the diuell dooth delude men and blinde them with their ſwelling, he ſhall neuer ſee well. Some will ſay if theſe conſtitutions be not to binde the conſcience of men, why are men forced to keepe them? Why ſhould the diſcipline and cenſures of the Church driue men thereunto? In déede this is that which the freedome of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> can at no hand indure. To anſwer this, the reader muſt conſider what is the bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the conſcience. It is not to ſay ſimplie yee muſt for conſcience ſake doo it, or yee are bounde for conſcience ſake to doo it; for then all the humaine conſtitutions and lawes of princes may be ſaide to binde the conſcience, becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> willeth to obey them for conſcience <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> But by binding the conſcience is meant, that ſuch lawes are laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſcience to bee obſerued as part of the worſhip of God: when men are puniſhed for not keeping them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning Gods worſhip, then is the Chriſtian libertie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode. But when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſcipline &amp; cenſures of the Church, doo compel men to obſerue the lawes, which in matters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and order are made according to the rules of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19054:67"/>
they are not puniſhed for dooing or not doing the things themſelues, but that by dooing that which is forbidden, or refuſing to doo that which is commaunded, they diſturb the peace, bréede diuiſions and offence, diſobey where they are commanded obedience: theſe bee ſinnes, and for theſe, men are to be puniſhed. This is where the orders be, not againſt the word of God, but fitte for edification.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude about this matter, all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God vnder heauen doe make ſuch lawes, ſuch Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſtitutions in matters of circumſtance, and by their diſcipline compell both Miniſters and people to obey the ſame. The <hi>Browniſt</hi> alleageth againſt this, not only the ſentences. <hi>Prouerbs. 30. verſ. 5. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Tell me now Maiſter <hi>Greenewood,</hi> doe ye yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all Churches? Ye do affirme that they which make anie lawes, doe adde to the worde of God, and alleage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that God will put vpon them the plagues writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in that booke: which is a denouncing of the extreame wrath of God, for there is the lake of fire ſet foorth? If yee were not quite beſide your ſelfe, how could you thus hurle your dartes of extreame condemnation, and ſtrike all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and yet when I tell yee of it, crie out, that I am a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prophet, and will me to remember who is the father of vntrueths?

And moreouer, that things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different by themſelues or otherwiſe, doo after a ſort change their nature, when by ſome lawfull commaundement they are either commaunded or forbidden.

            <p>What haue I ſaid more than the Churches do hold, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Beza</hi> and all the moſt noble Inſtruments of GOD in theſe laſt daies, if I ſhould ſtand to ſhewe it. Then ye may ſee when Maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> doth ſo raginglie take on, and ſtrike he knowes not whom, ſuch furie is not fit for diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Church. Let not the reader here ſuppoſe that I goe about to maintaine that the prayer of any is pleaſing to God, which come with cuſtomarie words of courſe without feeling their wants: or that I ſhould hold, that a ſet forme of prayer is of men to bee vttered without meditation and preparation, as many doo of an idle cuſtome, as if the verie ſaying were a great ſeruice to God. Nor yet doo I hold that all men alike ſtand in néede of preſcript forme in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate praiers, or that the feruencie of praier is not often times more vehement in vttering any requeſt in priuate prayer without preſcript forme than with it, if a man be able. I ſay further; A man is to cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God not only as his néed in any particular ſhal vrge him, euen at al times: but he is alſo to ſtir vp himſelfe and to prepare himſelfe to begge moe things than bee in his preſent feeling and memorie, which preſcript formes are an help to direct him vnto. And when a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the publike aſſemblies to pray, the caſe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differing from making his priuate requeſts: for there he commeth not to craue thoſe things alone which hee fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19054:69"/>
preſent neede of, or which hee is mooued withall, but to make common requeſts with the whole congregation, in all things that they are to craue. To this he muſt now frame himſelfe: Among fiue or ſixe hundred, the particular wants or deſires are ſundrie, one mooued more in one thing: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in another thing: ſome come more fitter to pray, for this, and ſome for that. It is moſt certaine, that neither the preſcipt forme, nor the preacher can ſee into theſe ſeuerall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of mens mindes &amp; conſciences, or to the deſires which they are moſt fit and prepared to expreſſe: neither is that ſo much to bee regarded, ſeeing that which ſhould be fitteſt for one part, ſhould not be ſo fit for another: but they muſt euery one frame himſelfe to pray for al things which the aſſemblie doth pray for, which are neceſſarie to be praied for at al times and of all perſons. Shall any man ſay, I am not prepared to begge theſe things, therefore they be not fit for me? Let him not be ſo wicked, but ſtirre vp himſelfe rather to begge them with the congregation. Shall any be ſo fooliſh as to ſay, wee knowe theſe things before, I am not mooued with them, men for the moſt part do but repeat them of cuſtome? Nay rather let him ſtriue againſt ſuch impietie, and ſay the things are not any thing the leſſe precious which wee craue, becauſe wee heare them often or knowe them before, or that many abuſe them: and therefore we indeuour to begge them earneſtlie with all faithful ones in the aſſemblie, ſeeing they bee ſuch as are needfull to be praied for. In the reſt I leaue the reader to compare his booke with my former.</p>
            <p>The laſt Argument. <hi>The prayers of ſuch Miniſters and people as ſtand vnder a falſe gouernment are not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Thoſe Miniſters which ſtand ſubiect to the Biſhops and their Courts, are ſubiect to a falſe gouernment and to Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did referre the anſwere of theſe to the third and fourth accuſation: but yet I did take ſome exception, as my booke ſheweth. The <hi>Browniſt</hi> in replying here is in great diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: I will let all his words paſſe, and come to the matter. I alleaged out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> Chapt. 7. that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19054:69"/>
S. <hi>Paule</hi> was held in ſome bondage, and therefore that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem from aboue is not in this world ſo free, but that ſhe and all her children are in ſome ſpirituall bondage. At this he did crie out of Atheiſme &amp; carnal Libertiniſme, affirming that S. <hi>Paule</hi> neuer continued captiue vnto ſinne after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, neither gaue place vnto euill thoughts. Where I haue iuſtly charged him with very foule matter, which now labouring to waſh away, he doth bemire himſelfe. Firſt he crieth out of wrong in diuers things without any cauſe. Such as do touch the queſtion of gouernment and the blaſts he bloweth that way, I doo here omit, becauſe his fellowes doo make replie as he mentioneth vnto thoſe things, and I muſt then anſwere. Onely I deale with him now touching the place to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> He willeth if I haue any common honeſtie, to let his former anſwer be ſeene. I promiſe ye it will be ſmall to your credite and honeſtie let whoſoeuer ſee it, ſeeing ye doo in ſhameles manner crie out of wreſting and I knowe not what. Againſt my reaſon out of the words of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> denie if ye haue the forehead, theſe to bee your words. And now (ſay you) that Scripture which the Apoſtle hath ſet downe in the anguiſh of his ſoule, concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtrife of the fleſh and the ſpirit, you ſhamefully peruert to your owne condemnation except you repent: for <hi>Paule</hi> neuer continued captiue vnto ſinne after his regeneration, neither gaue place vnto euill thoughts. <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh there of the vnperfectnes of his owne righteouſnes, which maketh the lawe deadlie vnto him. I will thinke you a fleſhlie Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine, if you reca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not this doctrine. What Atheiſt would thus haue defended his owne groſſe ſinnes? Thus farre go your wordes, and now let ſuch as haue knowledge iudge what wrong I haue done ye. Let them looke vpon that which I haue publiſhed, and ſee whether I haue wreſted your words, or ſet downe any vnſound poynt of doctrine as you would yet accuſe me, and doo importunatelie crie out: but now your words are in the light, and your anſwere alſo which ye cannot vſe ſuch ſhifts to excuſe. You lay open the diſagreement betweene you and me. Firſt you cannot agree
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19054:70"/>
to this, that the regenerate may be ſayd to ſtand in any bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to ſinne. You cannot conclude againſt it, but bring in another ſaying and ſo draw a concluſion: And that is, how I alſo affirme that one ſtanding in bondage to open knowne ſinne, may in that eſtate bee accepted and communicated with as the ſeruant of Chriſt by outward profeſſion both at one inſtant: which is as to ſay, wee may bee to mans ſight the ſeruant of the diuell, and the ſeruant of Chriſt both at one time by outward profeſſion. So none ſhould bee excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, none without, the world and the Church, light and darknes, Chriſt and Belial, ſhould bee mingled together. Well, then I aſke this queſtion both of your ſelfe and of your fellowes, whether there be any one of ye that can ſtand foorth and ſay, I ſee no ſinne in my ſelfe; but ſo ſoone as I haue eſpied I ouercome and am not at all led by it. Tell me further, whether ye haue not this, that ye may ſay there is euil alwayes in ye which you cannot be rid of; and that doth holde ye faſt and preſſe ye? Do ye not leaue the good vndone and commit euill, and ſuch euil as is alwayes preſent in ye? Doe not ye find great ſinnes that ye ſtand vnder as not able to come out of? If any <hi>Browniſt</hi> ſhall deny he is ſuch, or in this eſtate, he can be but a proud hypocrite. If yee confeſſe it, what doe you but confeſſe ſome bondage? Let me aſke ye further, is there any of ye which dare ſtand foorth and ſay I am not a ſinner in the ſight of men? I ſtand not holden vnder any outward ſinne: the <hi>Browniſt</hi> muſt aunſwere theſe queſtions, for he holdeth that men can not outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare ſinners and be the ſeruants of Chriſt at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. What beaſtly geare is this? There is ſinne that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the beſt men at al times, in geſture, in words, in deedes, in negligence, in wants, yea a thouſand waies: who is able to indure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trial of Gods law euen in that which outwardly doth appeare in him for an howre? And will yee caſt foorth all in whome there appeareth ſinne that he dooth abide in? The groſe open ſinners I confeſſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and giue offence are to be caſt foorth, but are thoſe which abide within at any time free from open ſinne? coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19054:70"/>
is a foule ſinne, ſo is pride, ſelfe loue, and wrath. Doe all <hi>Browniſts</hi> ſo fully ſhine in brightnes before men that in none of theſe nor any other they can bee diſcerned to be ſinners? Doth all vertue ſhine foorth in them? And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that which I charged you withall, looke better now vpon your owne ſpeech: If there bee any modeſtie in ye, it will be hard for ye to deny, but that I haue layde no more to your charge than your owne plaine wordes. For are not theſe wordes plaine, <hi>Paule <hi>neuer continued captiue vnto ſinne after his regeneration, neither gaue place vnto euill thoughts?</hi>
               </hi> But now you make a proteſtation that you haue euer been free from ſuch an hereſie, and your laſt writing did teſtifie much. Touching your writing it was both laſt and firſt, except your bare argument: and there is no heede to take what ye ſay, for your matter commeth foorth as the ſtreame doth turne the wheele, euen vnto contrary motions. When before the rage of the ſtreame turned the wheele to vtter the freedome of the Church, then it muſt bee in ſuch perfection that the regenerate is not partly held captiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne, nor giueth place vnto euill thoughts.</p>
            <p>Now when the wheele muſt haue a contrarie motion to purge your ſelfe, there commeth as violent a ſtreame that way. For here ye ſay, the children of God after regeneration may commit any ſinne, except the ſin againſt the holy ghoſt. And you alſo affirme that they may commit ſin of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and obſtinate ſinne: In my iudgment you had neede of ſome fauourable expoſition of your ſpeech. The regenerate doubtles, as we haue examples in the ſcriptures may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grieuous ſinnes, and doe through frailtie: but that it may be of preſumption and obſtinacie, you muſt declare how fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie inceſt is not the ſinne againſt the holy ghoſt, nor if a man kill his Father, Mother, or Children. No more is witchcraft, and familiaritie with diuels. Is it your meaning, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate may of preſumption and obſtinacie committe theſe? If not, why doe you vtter ſuch wordes and not make them plaine. I ſpake vpon the place to the Romaines, that the freedome of the Church in this world is but in parte and not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19054:71"/>
perfect: he cried out, a fleſhly libertie. If I ſhould haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as he ſpeaketh here, what would he haue ſaide? But hee now he is afraide leaſt while hee hath waſhed himſelfe ouer cleane from Anabaptiſme, he ſhould ouerthrow <hi>Browniſme,</hi> as indeede he doth. And that is the cauſe whie hee tempereth his ſpeech in the wordes following: that although in Gods fight obſtinat ſinners may be regenerate and ſo his children, yet not to men by outward profeſſion: but are to be caſt foorth which I doe not denie; and then for the leaſt bowing downe to a falſe gouernement, they are to be caſt foorth. This I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite as not the queſtion betweene him and me, and leaue his words to be conſidered of the reader. But where he procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in reaſoning againſt me as if I held that obſtinate groſe ſinners are not teo bee caſt foorth by excommunication: I maruaile from whence he can gather that. But let vs come to <hi>S. Paule</hi> againe, and ſee how maſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> excuſeth his owne ſpeech, and condemneth mine. It is out of doubt that as God is immortal &amp; doth begette by immortal ſeede, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſpeaketh: ſo all which are borne of GOD and haue therefore receiued the ſpirite of regeneration, can neuer looſe that ſpirit. Whoſoeuer is borne of God doth not committe ſinne becauſe his ſeede abideth in him: neither can he ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is borne of God. <hi>1. Iohn. 3. v. 9.</hi> From hence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Greenwood</hi> holdeth himſelfe cleered, and may well ſay that <hi>S. Paule</hi> after regeneration ſtoode not in any bondage to ſinne, nor gaue place vnto euill thoughts: becauſe he euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and the ſpirit of God in him did not, nor could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or giue place vnto ſinne. His meaning then is this, that the regeneration which is from the ſpirite cannot be in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to ſinne, and the graces of the ſpirite cannot conſent or giue place vnto euill thoughts. This is moſt true, vnleſſe a man will be ſo wicked as to holde that the grace of God may be in bondage and conſent to the worke of the deuill. If this had been the matter in queſtion betweene vs, and he had ſaid no more, it could not be reprooued.

it of the new man, or inner man, or of the whole man. My wordes are extant in print, let all the <hi>Browniſts</hi> ſconne them, and ſee whether they can without falſehood and lying gather from them that I conclude that the new man or inner man which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of regeneration is in bondage to ſin, or doth conſent vnto euill thoughts: the whole courſe of my wordes doth lay open the contrarie. For I ſhew how <hi>Paule</hi> touching the inner man conſented to the law of God: And that in his minde, that is in the regeneration, he did ſerue the law of God. What is it then which maketh maſter <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> ſo boldlie to accuſe, and ſo falſely? Euen the mother of headdy boldnes, and much falſhood, palpable ignorance. For where I ſtand to affirme, that paule a regenerate man ſtood yet in ſome captiuitie and bondage vnto ſinne. He doth ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it will followe, that I affirme the regeneration to be in bondage vnto ſinne: becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> is the whole man, and he that concludeth vpon the whole, concludeth vpon euerie part. In deede this is it which hath deceiued the <hi>Browniſt,</hi> and by which he thus laboureth to ſeduce others: that where the Scripture calleth the regeneration, or the graces of the ſpirit, the new man and the inner man, (as it calleth the corruption of nature the olde man, and the bodie of ſinne) he vnderſtandeth it, as though the perſon himſelfe, who is regenerate were called the new man, or the inner man, which is farre wide: for the graces of the ſpirite, the worke of the ſpirite, the regeneration called the inner man, are one thing, and the man himſelfe which is regenerat, another. The bodie and ſoule are <hi>Paul,</hi> the regeneration called the inner man, or the graces of the Spirite, are not <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, but in <hi>Paul.</hi> The ſoule &amp; bodie are <hi>Paul,</hi> the corruption through concupiſcence called the olde man, is not <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe but is in <hi>Paul?</hi> becauſe the regeneration ſhall neuer be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the regenerate are reckoned and eſteemed after it, not that the regeneration itſelfe is, either the man or a part of the man. <hi>Dauid</hi> was a man regenerate, he committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, and murther, the ſoule and bodie of <hi>Dauid</hi> ſinned, whole <hi>Dauid</hi> doth acknowledge himſelfe a ſinner, that is,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19054:72"/>
he was a ſinner both in bodie and ſoule: and yet the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the ſeede of God in him, the graces of the Spirite, which were as coles of fire for the time couered in the aſhes, did not ſinne, nor conſent vnto euill thought. <hi>Paul</hi> a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man, when he ſaith <hi>Autos ego, <hi>I my ſelfe</hi>
               </hi> in the minde ſerue the lawe of God, but in the fleſh the lawe of ſinne, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not the regeneration, I my ſelfe, but his ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die which were <hi>Paul:</hi> then the bodie and ſoule of <hi>Paul</hi> in the minde, that is ſo farre as they were regenerate, did ſerue the lawe of God. The ſame bodie and ſoule of <hi>Paul</hi> in the fleſh, that is in the corruption of nature remaining, becauſe rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is not full and perfect, did ſerue the lawe of ſinne: for he ſaith I my ſelfe for both. The fleſh in this place is not <hi>Paul,</hi> nor no part of <hi>Paul,</hi> but the corruption of ſinne ſpread ouer the bodie and ſoule of <hi>Paul.</hi> Euen ſo, the minde is not <hi>Paul,</hi> nor anie part of <hi>Paul,</hi> but the worke of Grace remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the ſoule and bodie of <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Browniſt,</hi> not vnderſtanding, but as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>They would be Doctors of the law, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they ſpeake, nor whereof they affirme. 1. Timo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1. would haue vs beleeue him, that <hi>Paul</hi> after regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not in anie reſpect held captiue vnto ſinne, nor gaue place vnto euill thoughts: becauſe the grace of God in Paul was not in bondage vnto ſinne nor conſented.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I my ſelfe in the fleſh ſerue the law of ſinne:</hi> which as I expounded in my former booke, doth not prooue that ſinne did raigne, or that it is to be accounted ſuch a ſeruice to ſinne as is done on the other part to God, becauſe this is by violent tyrannie againſt the will, ſo farre as the grace of regeneration hath reformed it; and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to the lawe of God is with delight and willingneſſe. This is the reaſon why he ſaith, <hi>It is no longer I, but the ſinne that dwelleth in mee.</hi> It is not reckened his ſinne before God, becauſe hee doth hate it: but yet it ſticketh faſt both in his ſoule and bodie. <hi>It is no longer I that ſinne:</hi> The <hi>Browniſtes</hi> expoſition is to this effect, <hi>It is no longer I that is the inner man, or the graces of the ſpirit that</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:19054:72"/>
               <hi>doe it, but ſinne that dwelleth in me.</hi> Did the grates of regeneration euer commit ſinne, or the inner man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If not, how can it be ſaide it is no longer I, for nothing can be ſaid to do no longer, that hath not don before? And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, <hi>but ſin that dwelleth in me, this in me,</hi> is not in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for though ſin dwel in man together with the works of grace, yet is it no fitte ſpeech to ſay ſinne dwelleth in the regeneration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore this I, when he ſaith, <hi>it is no longer I that do it,</hi> is not the inner man, but the perſon of <hi>Paul</hi> conſiſting of ſoule and bodie. How fondly then doth Maiſter <hi>Greenewood</hi> affirme, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> in that place touching his bondage to ſinne, ſpeaketh but of that which is called the olde man? The olde man is the concupiſcence and corruption of ſinne. Where I alleaged that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>he ſaw a law in his members that did leade him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the law of ſinne,</hi> hee ſaith I falſefie the text: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is leading me captiue, and not did leade me cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in the time preſent, leaſt he might ſeeme to ſpeake of a former eſtate which he was not in then. And it was more effctuall to lay open the bondage to ſinne, which in ſome reſpect the regenerate are in, though ſinne haue not dominion ouer them, for him to ſay, at that inſtant holding me captiue, then to ſay did leaue me captiue. The cauſe why I put it in the time paſt is, that <hi>Paul</hi> is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long ſince. The diſciples ſawe Ieſus walking on the water, doe I falſefie the text, if I ſay they ſawe Ieſus did walke vpon the water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this is not all, for this <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi> ſaith, holding him captiue, but it did not holde him. What can bee a more flatte contradiction than this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his reaſon is becauſe there was a ſtronger, that ſuffered not the law in his members to raigne. The matter is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a full dominion of ſinne, but whether the body and ſoule were not ſo yoaked ſtill with it, as to be forced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinne. Now let me haue an anſwere to this, eyther from Maiſter <hi>Greenewood,</hi> or any other <hi>Browniſt</hi> whether the regeneration be perfect in any. He will ſay I do hym
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19054:73"/>
great wrong to aſke him ſuch a queſtion, becauſe he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the contrarie. Well then, anſwere alſo whether the freedome of Gods children from ſinne, while they liue here be perfect, or but in part, as the regeneration is? If ye will ſay the freedome is perfect, ſhew how there can be a perfect freedome from ſinne, by a ſanctification which is but a part. If ye ſay the freemdome is but in part and vnperfect, as ye muſt needes ſay, (vnleſſe ye will bee right <hi>Annabaptiſts</hi> indeede) then tell me how it is poſſible, that where the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is but in part, that ſhould be no bondage? For what is the imperfection of freedome, but that it taketh not away all bondage? looke how farre the freedome commeth ſhort of perfection, ſo farre bondage doth remaine, chuſe whether part ye will to affirme, eyther the freedome of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from ſinne while they liue here to be perfect, or elſe to be vnperfect. For if ye ſhall ſay the freedome is alreadie perfect, (as ye haue hetherto, by affirming that the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate are in no bondage to ſinne) then ſhall ye continue in <hi>Annabaptiſtrie.</hi> If ye denie the freedome of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to be perfect as yet, (which in deede is the ſound truth) then conſider that howe much is wanting of perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſo much remaineth of that bondage to ſinne, which as yet al ſtand vnder that line, and acknowledge your madnes in affirming ſo directly contrarie to the Scriptures, that Paul neuer continued captiue vnto ſinne after regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor gaue place vnto euill thoughtes.</p>
