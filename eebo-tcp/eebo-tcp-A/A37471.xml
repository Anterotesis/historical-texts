         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IF you fear you are Infected, or feel any Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
riſing, or any Apoſtumation burning or
pricking, abſtain from Sleep, for Sleep leadeth
the Venome to the Heart. That Day that you
are Infected, eat but little, or no Food; for evil
Humours ſo fill you, that they take away your
Stomack: Or if you do eat, then do you co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
to ſleep, and feel a great burning, with a
kind of ſhuddering, as it were, through Cold:
You have alſo a great Pain in the fore part of
the Head: You cannot endure to ride, or to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99076:4"/>
walk, or any motion of the Body; but are dull,
lumpiſh, and given wholly over to-ſadneſs and
drowſineſs.</p>
               <p>To prove, that theſe are Arguments, that
you are Infected; let any Man, finding his Body
in this Diſtemper, not ſtir or walk (which I
counſel him to do; for to goe into the Air, and
to uſe motion, keepeth the Poyſon longer from
the Heart) and he ſhall find within one half
Day, ſome Impoſtume riſing under his Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole,
in his Groyn, or behind his Ear.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing therefore (after you feel
your ſelf thus) is, with all ſpeed, to be let
blood; when you are let blood, ſleep not all
that Day; you muſt be let blood on the ſame
ſide the Swelling appears, if ſo be the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume
ariſe before you ſleep: but if it prick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you have ſlept, then be let blood on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſide: As if there be a ſwelling under the
left Arm, then be let blood on the right Arm,
If thou art ſaint or weak after letting blood,
then ſleep a little, yet every half hour ſtir thy
Body too and fro. If the Impoſtume wax bigger
and bigger, it is a good ſign that the Venome is
driven from the Heart, and will come forth.
To ripen it, do thus; Stamp Leaves of Elder,
and mix that Juice with Muſtard-Seed; of this
make a Plaiſter, and lay it on the Swelling.</p>

Oyl: Had he delivered us up to Famine, it
would have been a Burthen farr more grievous;

               <p>IT is true indeed, that Sin was the firſt Cauſe
of this <hi>Sickneſs;</hi> but as God doth not the
Works of Mercy, ſo he doth not the Works of
Juſtice, without a means. Our Sins were the
Parents of this <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> but it is a queſtion,
how God brought it in, there is no Man can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
determine, but many may conjecture,
And (I fear me) it was the want of Charity,
and the neglect of the Poor, in this City, which
partly cauſed this Infection; for how can it be
otherwiſe, but that, where multitudes are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered
together in a little room, and in it have
but little comfort; as no Raggs, to cover their
nakedneſs; no Linnen to ſhift them from filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
it cannot chuſe but cauſe them noyſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and by conſequence Infection: If then
the rich Men deſire to leave to be miſerable, let
them learn to be merciful, and free the City
from the multitudes of Poor.</p>

<hi>Andam,</hi> being compoſed of the ſame Matter,

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99076:11"/>
