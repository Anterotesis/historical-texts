            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, Go and ſhew John again thoſe things which ye do hear and ſee: The Blind receive their ſight, and the Lame walk, the Lepers are cleanſed, and the Deaf hear, the Dead are raiſed up, and the Poor have the Goſpel preached unto them. And bleſſed is he whoſoever ſhall not be offended in me.</p>

            <p>ABOUT the time of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's appearing in the World, there was a general expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Great Prince, that ſhould come out of <hi>Judea,</hi> and govern all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58790:5"/>
This the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had from the Prophecies of the <hi>Sybils,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vol. V.</note> which ſpake of a great King that was to appear in the World about that time. So <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> tells us, that the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was the utmoſt date of that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltima Cumaei venit jam carminis aetas:</hi> And <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us, <hi>that all over the Eaſtern Countries, there was an ancient and conſtant Tradition, that ſuch a Prince ſhould ſpring out of Judea:</hi> And for this Reaſon it is, that our Saviour is call'd by the Prophet, <hi>the Expectation of the Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But more eſpecially among the <hi>Jews,</hi> there was at that time a more lively and particular expectation, grounded upon the Predictions of their Prophets, of a Prince whom they call'd the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> or <hi>the Anointed</hi>; and thoſe who were more devout among them, did at that time wait for his appearance; as it is ſaid of <hi>Simeon,</hi> that <hi>he waited for the conſolation of Iſrael.</hi> Hence it was, that when <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the quality of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prophet, <hi>they ſent from Jeruſalem to enquire whether he were the Meſſias</hi>? John 1.19. <hi>The Jews ſent Prieſts and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58790:5"/>
Levites from Jeruſalem to ask him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ser. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Who art thou? And he confeſſed, and denied not, but confeſſed, I am not the Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> to whom it belonged to judge who were true Prophets, ſent to know whether he was the Meſſias or not? <hi>He would not take this honour to himſelf,</hi> but told them the Meſſias was juſt at hand; and the next day, <hi>when Jeſus came to be baptized of him,</hi> he bare record, <hi>that he was the Son of God, and that he ſaw the Spirit deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and abiding upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it is plain that he knew him, and bare witneſs of him, which makes it the more ſtrange, that here in the Text, <hi>he ſhould ſend two of his Diſciples to enquire,</hi> whether he were the Meſſias or not? <hi>Art thou he that ſhould come, or do we look for another?</hi> That is, art thou the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or not? for ſo he is call'd in the ancient Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he that ſhould come, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah, till Shiloh come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the reſolution of this difficulty, it is very probably ſaid by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58790:6"/>
and I think there is no Reaſon to doubt of it, that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did not ſend this Meſſage for his own ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, but to ſatisfy his Diſciples, who were never very willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Jeſus</hi> for the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> becauſe they thought he did ſhadow and cloud their Maſter. From whence we may take notice, how Men's Judgments are apt to be perverted by Faction and Intereſt; and that good Men are too prone to be ſwayed thereby; for ſuch we ſuppoſe the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> to have been; they will not believe their own Maſter, when they apprehend him to ſpeak againſt their Intereſt; for they knew that they muſt riſe and fall in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Eſteem, as their Maſter did. They believed that their Maſter was a Prophet, and came from God; yet for all that, they could not digeſt his Teſtimony of Chriſt, becauſe that ſet him above their Maſter; which they were ſagacious enough to perceive, that it tended to the diminution and leſſening of themſelves. And that this was the thing which troubled them, appears plainly from the Complaint which they make to their Maſter, <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58790:6"/>
3.26. <hi>The Diſciples of</hi> John <hi>came to him and ſaid, He that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou bareſt witneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſame baptizeth, and all men come to him.</hi> This troubled them, to ſee him invade their Maſter's Office, and that he began to have more Followers than <hi>John</hi> had; <hi>he baptizeth, and all men come to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This prejudice <hi>John</hi> had endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to root out of their minds, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, that he had always decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he was not the Meſſias, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>You your ſelves bear me witneſs, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt, but that I am ſent before him.</hi> But when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it ſtill to ſtick with them, and that they obſerved all his Actions, and the Miracles that he wrought, as if they had a mind to pick a quarrel with him (for St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who relates the ſame Story, tells us, that when our Saviour had healed the <hi>Centurion</hi>'s Servant, and raiſed from the dead the Widows Son at <hi>Naim,</hi> the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>John</hi> ſhewed him all theſe things) I ſay <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> perceiving that they watched him ſo narrowly, ſent two of his Diſciples to him, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58790:7"/>
they might receive full ſatisfaction from him. And St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, that upon their coming to him, he wrought many of his Miracles before them, to convince them that he was the true Meſſias, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.21, 22. <hi>And in that ſame hour he cured many of their infirmities, and plagues, and of evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and to many that were blind he gave ſight</hi>; and then ſaid to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>John, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have ſeen and heard; how that the blind ſee, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, the deaf hear, and the dead are raiſed, and to the poor the goſpel is preached; and bleſſed is he that is not offended in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that you ſee that the Reaſon why <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſent to our Saviour to know whether he was the Meſſias, was not to ſatisfy himſelf, for he had no doubt of it; but perceiving his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be ill-affected towards our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and hearing them ſpeak with ſome envy of his Miracles, he ſent them to him, that by ſeeing what he did, and hearing what account he gave of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they might receive full ſatisfaction concerning him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:58790:7"/>I have been the longer in the clearing of this, that Men upon every appearance of contradiction in the Evangelical Hiſtory, may not be too forward to ſuſpect the truth of it; but may be convinc'd, that if they would but have patience to examine things carefully, they would find that the Story does ſufficiently vindicate it ſelf; and tho' it be pen'd with great ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, yet there is ſufficient care taken, to free it from being guilty of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Occaſion of the words being thus cleared, there are in them theſe two things conſiderable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What it was that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſent his Diſciples to be ſatisfied about; and that was, <hi>whether he was the Meſſias or not? Now when John had heard in Priſon the works of Christ, he ſent two of his Diſciples.</hi> The Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of his being in Priſon, ſeems to be mention'd, to intimate to us the Reaſon why he did not come himſelf along with them; he ſent two of his Diſciples to him, who ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58790:8"/>
him, <hi>Art thou he that ſhould come, or do we look for another?</hi> And then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Anſwer which our Saviour returns to this Meſſage; <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, Go and ſhew John again the things which ye do ſee and hear; the blind receive their ſight, the lame walk, the lepers are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the deaf hear, the dead are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up, and the poor have the Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them; and bleſſed is he, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall not be offended in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that theſe words contain, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Evidence which our Saviour gives of his being the true Meſſias. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> an Intimation that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this Evidence which he gave of himſelf, yet many would be offended at him, and reject him; <hi>bleſſed is he whoſoever is not offended in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Evidence which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our gives of his being the true Meſſias: And to prove this, there were but <hi>two</hi> things neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:58790:8"/>1. To ſhew that he was ſent by God, and had a particular Commiſſion from him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he was the very Perſon of whom the Prophets foretold that he ſhould be the Meſſias.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe he proves by the Miracles which he wrought; and the <hi>ſecond,</hi> by the correſpondency of the things he did, with what was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets concerning the Meſſias; the Prophecies concerning the Meſſias were accompliſh'd in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By the Miracles which he wrought; <hi>the blind receive their ſight, and the lame walk, the lepers are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raiſed up.</hi> Here is a brief enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral ſorts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which our Saviour wrought, and theſe were a teſtimony to him that <hi>he came from God,</hi> and was ſent and Commiſſioned by him to declare his Will to the World. So he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf tells us, <hi>John</hi> 5.36. <hi>I have a greater wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58790:9"/>
than that of John, for the works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame works that I do, bear witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi> Upon the Evidence of theſe Miracles, <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a Ruler among the <hi>Jews,</hi> was convinced that he was ſent by God, <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>We know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can do theſe miracles that thou doſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God be with him.</hi> Nay his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Enemies were afraid of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, knowing how proper an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are to convince men, <hi>John</hi> 11.47. when <hi>the Chief Prieſts and Phariſees</hi> were met together in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil againſt him, they concluded, that if he were permitted to go on and work Miracles, he would draw all men after him. <hi>What do we?</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for this man doth many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; if we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him.</hi> This they ſaid, upon occaſion of the great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of raiſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead.</p>
            <p>And in Reaſon, Miracles are the higheſt Atteſtation that can be given to the Truth and Divinity of any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58790:9"/>
Doctrine; and ſuppoſing a Doctrine not to be plainly unworthy of God, and contrary to thoſe natural Notions which Men have of God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we can have no greater Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of it, than Miracles; they are ſuch an argument, as in its own nature is apt to perſuade and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce belief.</p>
            <p>All Truths do not need Miracles; ſome are of eaſy belief, and are ſo clear by their own light, that they need neither Miracle nor Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prove them. Such are thoſe ſelf-evident Principles which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind do generally agree in; others which are not ſo evident by their own light, we are content to receive upon clear demonſtration of them, or very probable Arguments for them, without a Miracle. And there are ſome Truths, which however they may be ſufficiently obſcure and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to moſt Men, yet are they ſo inconſiderable, and of ſo ſmall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as not to deſerve the atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Miracles; ſo that there is no reaſon to expect that God ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58790:10"/>
by a Miracle, to convince Men of them.</p>
            <q>Nec Deus interſit, niſi dignus vindice nodus Inciderit.</q>
            <p>But for ſuch Truths as are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be known by us, but are not ſufficiently evident of themſelves, nor capable of cogent Evidence, eſpecially to prejudiced and intereſted Perſons, God is pleaſed in this Caſe many times to work Miracles for our Conviction; and they are a proper Argument to convince us of a thing that is either in it ſelf obſcure and hard to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or which we are prejudiced againſt, and hardly brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; for they are an Argument <hi>à Majori ad Minus,</hi> they prove a thing which is obſcure and hard to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, by ſomething that is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, which yet they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, becauſe they ſee it done. Thus our Saviour proves himſelf to be an extraordinary Perſon, by <hi>doing ſuch things as never man did</hi>; he convinceth them, that they ought to believe what he ſaid, becauſe they ſaw him do thoſe things, which were harder to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58790:10"/>
believed (if one had not ſeen them) than what he ſaid.</p>
            <p>Miracles are indeed the greateſt external confirmation and evidence that can be given to the truth of any Doctrine, and where they are wrought with all the advantages they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, they are an unqueſtionable demonſtration of the truth of it; and ſuch were our Saviour's Miracles here in the Text, to prove that he was the true Meſſias; here are Miracles of all kinds, <hi>the blind receive their ſight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up.</hi> For the nature of them, they are ſuch as are moſt likely to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and to come from God, for they were healing and beneficial to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Our Saviour here inſtanceth in thoſe things which are of greateſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage, and which free Men from the greateſt miſeries and inconveniencies; the reſtoring of ſight to the Blind, and hearing to the Deaf; ſoundneſs and health to the Lame and the Leprous, and life to the Dead. And then for the number of them, they were many; not one
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58790:11"/>
inſtance of a kind, but ſeveral of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very kind, and great multitudes of moſt of them; and for the manner of their operation, they were publick, in the ſight and view of great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of People; to free them from all ſuſpicion of fraud and impoſture, they were not wrought privately and in corners, and given out and noiſed abroad, but before all the People, ſo that every one might ſee them, and judge of them; not only among his own Diſciples and Followers, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to work theirs, but among his Enemies, <hi>to convince thoſe that did not believe</hi>; and this not done once, and in one place, but at ſeveral times, and in all places where he came, and for a long time, for three years and a half; and after his death, he endowed his Diſciples and Followers with the ſame power, which laſted for ſome Ages. And then for the quality of them, they were Miracles of the greateſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; thoſe of them, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might have been performed by natural means, as healing the Lame, and the Leprous, and the Deaf, he did in a miraculous manner, by a word
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58790:11"/>
or a touch, yea and many times at a great diſtance. But others were not only in the manner of their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in the nature of the thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably miraculous, as giving of ſight to thoſe that had been born blind, and raiſing up the dead to life, as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> after he had lain in the grave four days; and himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the third day after he had been buried; which, if there ever was or can be any unqueſtionable Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the World, ought certainly to be reputed ſuch. So that our bleſſed Saviour had all the Atteſtation that Miracles can give, that he came from God. And this is the <hi>firſt</hi> Evidence of his being the Meſſias.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledge that the Meſſias, when he comes, ſhall work great Miracles; and their own <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud</hi> confeſſeth, that <hi>Jeſus the Son of Joſeph and Mary did work great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>; and the Hiſtory of the Goſpel does particularly relate more and greater Miracles wrought by him, than by <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets that had been ſince the World began; ſo that we may ſtill put the ſame
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58790:12"/>
queſtion to the <hi>Jews,</hi> which they did in our Saviour's time to one another; <hi>when Chriſt cometh,</hi> when the Meſſias whom ye expect comes, <hi>will he do more Miracles than theſe which this Man hath done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> this will yet more clearly appear by the correſpondency of the things here mentioned, with what was foretold by the Prophets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meſſias.</p>
            <p>Not to mention innumerable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his Birth, and Life, and Death, and Reſurrection, and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into Heaven, together with the ſucceſs and prevalency of his Doctrine in the World, all which are punctually foretold by ſome or other of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: I ſhall confine my ſelf to the particulars here in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It was foretold of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, that he ſhould work miraculous Cures. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.4, 5, 6. ſpeaking of the Meſſias, <hi>he will come and ſave you; then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the ears of the deaf ſhall be unſtopp'd;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58790:12"/>
then ſhall the lame man leap as an Hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſing</hi>; this you ſee was fulfilled here in the Text. 'Tis true indeed, the Text mentions another Miracle which is not in the Prophet, that <hi>he raiſed the dead</hi>; but if God did more than he promiſed and foretold, this is no prejudice to the argument, if all that he foretold was accompliſh'd in him. Beſides, the <hi>Jews</hi> have a Proverb, that God is not content to perform barely what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, but <hi>he uſually doth ſomething over and above his promiſe.</hi> That the Meſſias ſhould <hi>heal the blind,</hi> and <hi>the deaf,</hi> and <hi>the lame, Iſaiah</hi> Propheſied; and God makes good this Promiſe and Prediction to the full; the Meſſias did not only do theſe, but which is more and greater than any of theſe, <hi>he raiſed the dead to life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was likewiſe foretold of the Meſſias, that <hi>he ſhould preach the Goſpel to the poor,</hi> Iſa. 61.1. <hi>the ſpirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to preach the Goſpel</hi> or <hi>good tidings to the Poor</hi>; ſo the LXX render the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58790:13"/>
words; and they are the very words uſed by our Saviour here in the Text. 'Tis true indeed, this was no Miracle, but it was the punctual accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Prophecy concerning the Meſſias, and conſequently an evidence that he was the Meſſias. But beſides, it had ſomething in it which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the way of their Doctors and Teachers: For the <hi>Rabbies</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> would ſcarce inſtruct any but for great Reward; they would meddle with none but thoſe that were able to requite their pains: The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and poorer ſort of People they had in great contempt, as appears by that ſlighting expreſſion of them, John 7.48, 49. <hi>Have any of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or of the Phariſees believed on him? but this People who knoweth not the Law are curſed.</hi> And <hi>Grotius</hi> upon this Text tells us, that the Jewiſh Maſters had this fooliſh and inſolent Proverb among them, that <hi>the Spirit of God doth not reſt but upon a rich man</hi>; to which this Prediction concerning the Meſſias was a direct contradiction: <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58790:13"/>
the Goſpel to the Poor.</hi> In old time the Prophets were eſpecially ſent to the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the People: but this great Prophet comes <hi>to preach the Goſpel to the Poor.</hi> None have ſo little reaſon to be proud as the Sons of Men: but never was any ſo humble as the Son of God, our Saviour's whole Life and Doctrine was a contradiction to the falſe Opinions of the world; <hi>they</hi> thought the rich and great men of the World the only happy perſons, but <hi>he</hi> came <hi>to preach glad tidings to the Poor,</hi> to bring good news to them whom the great Doctors of the Law deſpiſed, and ſet at nought; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to confound their pride and folly, and to confute their falſe Opinions of things, he begins that excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of his with this Saying, <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor, for theirs is the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was foretold of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, that the World ſhould be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.14. <hi>He ſhall be for a ſtone of ſtumbling, and for a rock of offence to both the houſes of Iſrael.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1, 2, 3. <hi>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58790:14"/>
Lord revealed? he hath no form nor comelineſs, and when we ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him; he is deſpiſed and rejected of men, and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not</hi>; and this likewiſe is intimated in the laſt words of the Text, <hi>and bleſſed is he whoſoever ſhall not be offended in me.</hi> Intimating, that notwithſtanding the great works that he did among them, which teſtified of him that he came from God, notwithſtanding the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of their Prophets concerning the Meſſias, were ſo clearly and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually accompliſh'd in him; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, they would take offence at him upon one account or other, and reject him and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; but even this, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him, and would not own him for their Meſſias, was another Sign and Evidence that he was the true Meſſias foretold by the Prophets; for among other things this was expreſly Predicted concerning him, that he ſhould be deſpiſed and rejected of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58790:14"/>And thus I have done with the Firſt thing I propounded to ſpeak to; namely, the <hi>Evidence</hi> which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour here gives of his being the true Meſſias.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The many and great Miracles which he wrought, prove that he came from God. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The correſpondence of the things he did, with what was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets concerning the Meſſias, declare him to be the true Meſſias.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the next thing I propounded to ſpeak to, namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> An <hi>Intimation</hi> in the Text, that notwithſtanding all the Evidence Chriſt gave of himſelf, yet many would be offended at him, and reject him and his Doctrine. In ſpeaking to which, it will be very proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> How <hi>the Poor</hi> came to be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58790:15"/>
more diſpoſed to receive the Goſpel, than others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What thoſe Prejudices are which the World had againſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Religion at its firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, as alſo thoſe which men have at this day againſt the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to endeavour to ſhew the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How happy a thing it is to eſcape and overcome the common Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices which Men have againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> How the <hi>Poor</hi> came to be more diſpoſed to receive the Goſpel, than others; <hi>the Poor have the Goſpel preached unto them.</hi> Which does not only ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify that our Saviour did more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially apply himſelf to them, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that they were in a nearer diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to receive it, and did of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers give the moſt ready entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Doctrine: And this our Saviour declares to us in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Sermon upon the Mount, when he pronounceth the <hi>Poor</hi> bleſſed upon this account, becauſe they were
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58790:15"/>
nearer to the Kingdom of God than others; <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor, for theirs is the Kingdom of God.</hi> So likewiſe St. <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Hath not God choſen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him?</hi> So that it ſeems the <hi>Poor</hi> were upon ſome account or other in a nearer diſpoſition to receive the Goſpel, than the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Rich</hi> Men of this World. And of this there are three Accounts to be given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Poor had no Earthly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to engage them to reject our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Doctrine. The High-Prieſts, and Scribes, and Phariſees among the Jews, they had a plain worldly Intereſt which did engage them to oppoſe our Saviour and his Doctrine; for if he were received for the Meſſias, and his Doctrine embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, they muſt of neceſſity loſe their Sway and Authority among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and all that which rendred them ſo conſiderable, their pretended skill in the Law, and in the Traditions and Obſervances of their Fathers, together with their external ſhews of Piety and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58790:16"/>
Devotion, would ſignify nothing, if our Saviour and his Doctrine ſhould take place. And there are very few ſo honeſt and ſincere, as to be content for truth's ſake, to part with their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Authority, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs in the eſteem of men than they were before. Few are ſo impartial as to quit thoſe things which they have once laid great weight upon, and kept a great ſtir about, becauſe this is to acknowledge that they were in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and miſtaken in their Zeal; which few have the ingenuity to own, tho' it be never ſo plain to others; and therefore it is no wonder that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Doctrine met with ſo much reſiſtance from thoſe, who were ſo much concern'd in point of Honour and Reputation, to make head againſt it. And this account our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gives us of their Infidelity, <hi>John</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour which cometh of God only?</hi> And Chap. 12.43. <hi>For they loved the praiſe of Men more than the praiſe of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides the point of Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thoſe that were Rich, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58790:16"/>
in point of Intereſt, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Saviour and his Doctrine; becauſe he call'd upon Men <hi>to deny themſelves, and to part with Houſes and Lands, yea and life it ſelf, for his ſake, and for the Goſpel</hi>'s, which muſt needs be a very hard and unpleaſant Doctrine to Rich Men, who had great Eſtates, and had ſet their Hearts upon them. Upon this Account it is that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour pronounceth it ſo <hi>hard for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God</hi>; and compares it with thoſe Things that are moſt difficult, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly impoſſible; <hi>I ſay unto you, it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle, than for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the <hi>Poor</hi> were free from theſe Incumbrances and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they had nothing to loſe, and therefore our Saviour's Doctrine went down more eaſily with them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it did not contradict their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as it did the Intereſt of thoſe who had great Eſtates and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:58790:17"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Reaſon of this is, that thoſe that are <hi>Poor,</hi> and enjoy lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the good things of this Life, are willing to entertain good News of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in another. Thoſe who are in a ſtate of preſent Miſery and Suffering, are glad to hear that it ſhall be well with them hereafter, and are willing to liſten to the good News of a future Happineſs; and therefore our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, when he had pronounced the <hi>Poor, Bleſſed, Luke</hi> 6.20. He adds by way of Oppoſition, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>But wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you that are rich; for ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your Conſolation.</hi> They were in ſo comfortable a Condition at preſent, that they were not much concerned what ſhould become of them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; whereas all the Comfort that <hi>Poor</hi> Men have, is the hopes of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Condition, <hi>non ſi male nunc, &amp; olim ſic erit,</hi> that <hi>if it be bad now, it will not be ſo always,</hi> and therefore no wonder if the Promiſes and Aſſurance of a future Happineſs be very welcome to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If by the <hi>Poor</hi> we do not only underſtand thoſe who were
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58790:17"/>
in a low and mean Condition as to the Things of this World, but ſuch likewiſe as had a Temper, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Mind ſuitable to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of their outward Condition, which our Saviour calls <hi>Poverty of Spirit,</hi> by which he means <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> there is no doubt but that ſuch a Frame and Temper of Spirit is a great Diſpoſition to the receiving of Truth. And that this is included in the Notion of <hi>Poverty,</hi> is very plain, both from the Words of the Prophecy I cited before, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good Tidings to the meek, and to bind up the broken-hearted</hi>; and likewiſe from our Saviour's Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Perſons, in one of the Evangeliſts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of God.</hi> So that by the <hi>Poor,</hi> who are ſo nearly diſpoſed to receive the Goſpel, our Saviour intended thoſe, who, being in a <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>low</hi> Condition in Reſpect of outward Things, were likewiſe <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> in their Spirits. Now Meekneſs and Humility are great Diſpoſitions
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58790:18"/>
to the entertaining of Truth. Theſe Graces and Virtues do prepare the Minds of Men for Learning and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; Meekneſs, and Modeſty, and Humility, are the proper Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of a Scholar. He that hath a mean Opinion of himſelf is ready to learn of others; he who is not blinded by Pride or Paſſion, is more apt to conſider things impartially, and to paſs a truer Judgment upon them, than the Proud and the Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Paſſion and Pride are great Obſtacles to the receiving of Truth, and to our Improvement in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Paſſion does not only darken the Minds of Men, but puts a falſe Biaſs upon our Judgments, which draws them off many times from Truth, and ſways them that way which our Paſſion inclines them. A Man of a calm and meek Temper, ſtands always indifferent for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Truth, and holds the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of his Judgment even; but Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſways and inclines it one way, and that commonly againſt Truth and Reaſon. So likewiſe Pride is a great Impediment to Knowledge, and the very worſt Quality that a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58790:18"/>
Learner can have; it obſtructs all the Paſſages whereby Knowledge ſhould enter into us, it makes Men refuſe Inſtruction, out of a Conceit they need it not. Many Men might have known more, had it not been for the vain Opinion which they have entertained of the ſufficiency of their Knowledge. This is true in all kinds of Learning, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to the Knowledge of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things. For God loves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelf, and beſtow his Grace and Wiſdom upon meek and humble Minds. So the Scripture tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.9. <hi>The Meek will be guide in Judgment, and the Meek will he teach his Ways.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Be clothed with Humility; for God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth Grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have ſhewn in what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the <hi>Poor</hi> were more diſpoſed for the receiving the Goſpel, than others. I proceed now to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Thing, namely, What thoſe Prejudices and Objections are, which the World had againſt our Saviour
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58790:19"/>
and his Religion at their firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; as alſo to enquire into thoſe which Men have at this Day againſt the Chriſtian Religion, and to ſhew the Weakneſs and Unreaſonableneſs of them. I begin,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> With thoſe Prejudices which the World had againſt our Saviour and his Religion at their firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him and his Doctrine; but not both upon the ſame account. They both took Exceptions at him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at his low and ſuffering Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but not both upon the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I ſhall begin with the Exceptions which the <hi>Jews</hi> took againſt our bleſſed Saviour and his Religion; and I ſhall reduce them all, or at leaſt the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable of them (as I find them diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles) to theſe Six Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Exceptions which they took againſt him upon account of his Extraction and Original.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:58790:19"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> At the Meanneſs of his Condition, contrary to their Univerſal Expectation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to his Miracles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His Converſation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Prejudice that lay againſt him from the Oppoſition that was made by Perſons of greateſt Knowledge and Authority among them. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That the Religion which he endeavour'd to introduce, did aboliſh and ſuperſede their ancient Religion, as of no longer Uſe and Continuance, though it was plain it was at firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Exceptions which they took at his Extraction and Original. In relation to this they were offended at three Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That his Original was known among them. This you find urged againſt him, <hi>John</hi> 7.27. <hi>We know this Man whence he is, but when the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58790:20"/>
Meſſias comes, no Man knows whence he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This to be ſure was no juſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in reaſon againſt him. For what if his Extraction were known, might he not be from God for all that? They owned <hi>Moſes</hi> for the greateſt Prophet that ever was, and yet it was very well known from whence he was.</p>
            <p>But they ſeem to refer to ſome Prophecy of the Old Teſtament, which did ſeem to aſſert ſo much. If they meant that his Extraction ſhould be altogether unknown; they knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, and believed the contrary, that <hi>he was to be of the Line of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and to come out of Bethlehem.</hi> If they referr'd to that Prophecy, that <hi>a Virgin ſhould conceive and bear a Son,</hi> and ſo underſtood that he ſhould be without Father; this was really true, tho' they thought that he was the Son of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> And if he affirmed that he had no Father, he did ſufficiently juſtify it by his Miracles; that being as eaſy to be believed poſſible by a Divine Power,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58790:20"/>
as the Miracles which he wrought; which yet they could not deny, becauſe they ſaw them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Prejudice againſt his Extraction, was the Meanneſs of his Parents and Breeding. This you find mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.54, 55. <hi>Whence hath this Man this Wiſdom and theſe mighty Works? Is not this the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Son, is not his Mother called Mary; and his Brethren James and J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſes, and Simon and Judas? And his Siſters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this Man theſe things? And they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in him.</hi> And ſo likewiſe, <hi>John</hi> 7.15. <hi>How knoweth this Man Letters, having never learned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſtrange Prejudice and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable. They could not believe him to be an extraordinary Perſon, becauſe his Parents and Relations, his Birth and Breeding were ſo mean. He had been brought up to a Trade, and not brought up to Learning; whereas in Reaſon, this ought to have been an Argument juſt the other way; that he was an extraordinary Perſon, and divinely aſſiſted, who
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58790:21"/>
all on the ſudden, without the help and aſſiſtance of Education, gave ſuch Evidence of his great Wiſdom and Knowledge, and did ſuch mighty Works. This could not be imputed to his Breeding, for that was mean; therefore there muſt be ſomething Extraordinary and Divine in it. Thus another Man, who had been free from Prejudice, would have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The moſt unreaſonable Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of all, in reſpect of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, was grounded upon a ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and malicious Proverb, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Country where our Saviour was brought up, and they ſuppoſed him to be born; and that was <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee. John</hi> 1.46. <hi>Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 7.41. <hi>Shall the Meſſias come out of Galilee?</hi> And v. 52. <hi>Search and look, for out of Galilee ariſeth no Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it ſeems <hi>Nathanael,</hi> who was a good Man, was eaſily taken off from this common Prejudice, when <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>come and ſee.</hi> He bids him come and ſee the Works
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58790:21"/>
he did, and then refers it to him, whether he would believe his own Eyes, or an old Proverb. However, it ſeems the <hi>Jews</hi> laid great weight upon it, as if this alone were enough to confute all his Miracles, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ſhot this Bolt at him, the Buſineſs were concluded clearly againſt him. But prudent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Men do not uſe to give much Credit to ill-natur'd Proverbs; the good or bad Characters which are given of Countreys are not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be univerſally true, and without Exception. There is no place but hath brought forth ſome brave Spirits, and excellent Perſons; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the general Temper and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Inhabitants may be. Among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Beotians</hi> were eſteemed a dull People, even to a Proverb; and yet <hi>Pindar,</hi> one of their chief Poets, was one of them. The <hi>Scythians</hi> were a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nation, and one would have thought no good could have come from thence; and yet that Country yielded <hi>Anacharſis</hi> an eminent Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher. The <hi>Idumeans</hi> were Aliens, and Strangers to the Covenant; and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58790:22"/>
yet <hi>Job,</hi> one of the beſt Men that ever was, came from thence. God can raiſe up eminent Perſons from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place; <hi>Abraham</hi> from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> and an Idolatrous People. Nay as our Saviour tells us, <hi>he can out of Stones raiſe up Children unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> The wiſe God, in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, does not tie himſelf to our fooliſh Proverbs. It is not neceſſary to make a Man a Prophet, that he ſhould be bred in a good Air. If God ſends a Man, it matters not from what Place he comes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Head of Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt our Saviour, was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his outward Condition, ſo contrary to the Univerſal Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> from the Tradition of their Fathers, to which they (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does at this Day,) paid a greater Reverence, than to the written word of God, were poſſeſt with a ſtrong Perſwaſion, that the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom they expected, was to be a great Prince and Conqueror, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all Nations to them; ſo that nothing could be a greater defeat to their Expectations, than the mean and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58790:22"/>
low Condition, in which our Saviour appeared; ſo that upon this Account they were almoſt univerſally offended at him.</p>
            <p>But this Prejudice was very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. For neither did their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets foretel any ſuch thing, as the Temporal Greatneſs of the <hi>Meſſias</hi>: But on the contrary moſt expreſly, that <hi>he ſhould be deſpiſed and rejected of Men,</hi> that <hi>he ſhould be a Man of Sorrows and Sufferings,</hi> and at laſt <hi>be put to death</hi>; which was directly contrary to what they expected from their ill-grounded Tradition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Againſt his Miracles they made theſe two Exceptions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he wrought them by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Skill, and by the Power of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Which was ſo exorbitantly unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and malicious, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour pronounceth it to be an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable</hi> Sin, and for Anſwer to it, appeals to every Man's Reaſon, whether it was likely <hi>that the Devil ſhould conſpire againſt himſelf, and aſſiſt any Man to overthrow his own Kingdom?</hi> For it was plain, our Saviour's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58790:23"/>
was directly contrary to the Devil's Deſign; and therefore to aſſiſt him to work Miracles for the Confirmation of it, muſt have been apparently againſt his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and to the Ruin of his own Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They pretended that though he did many great Works, yet he gave them no Sign from Heaven. <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.1. it is ſaid, <hi>They deſired him to ſhew them a Sign from Heaven.</hi> It ſeems they expected that God ſhould give ſome immediate Teſtimony to him from Heaven; as he did to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi> when Fire came down from Heaven, and conſumed his Enemies; And particularly they expected, that when he was upon the Croſs, if he were the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> he ſhould have come down and ſaved himſelf: And becauſe he did not anſwer their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation in this, they concluded him an Impoſtor.</p>
            <p>Now what could be more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable? when he had wrought ſo many other, and great Miracles, perverſly to inſiſt upon ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58790:23"/>
kind of Miracle which they fancied? As if God were bound to gratifie the Curioſity of Men; and as if our Saviour were not as much <hi>declared to be the Son of God, by riſing again from the Dead,</hi> as if he had <hi>come down from the Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to his Converſation, they had theſe three Exceptions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he uſed no ſeverity in his Habit or Diet, took too much Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as they thought; <hi>came Eating and Drinking,</hi> that is, he freely uſed the Creatures of God, for the end for which they were given, with Temperance and Thankſgiving; and did not lay thoſe rigorous Reſtraints upon himſelf in theſe matters, which many, that were eſteemed the moſt Religious among them, uſed to do.</p>
            <p>But he plainly ſhews them, that this Exception was meerly out of their Prejudice againſt him. For if he had come in the way of Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they would have rejected him as well. They were reſolved to find Fault with him, whatever he did.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58790:24"/>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Whereunto ſhall I liken this Generation? John the Baptiſt came neither eating nor drinking, and they ſay He hath a Devil.</hi> He lived in a more auſtere and melancholly way, <hi>he came in the way of Righteouſneſs,</hi> uſed great Strictneſs and Severity in his Habit and Diet, and this they took Exception at. Our Saviour was of a quite contrary Temper, and that did not pleaſe them neither. <hi>The Son of Man came eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they ſay, behold, a Wine-bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and a Glutton.</hi> So that let our Saviour have done what he would, he could not have carried himſelf ſo, as to have eſcaped the Cenſures of Men, ſo peeviſhly and perverſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he kept Company with Publicans and Sinners.</p>
            <p>To which Exception nothing can be more reaſonable than our Saviour's own Anſwer; that he was ſent to be <hi>a Phyſician</hi> to the World, <hi>to call Sinners to Repentance</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had no Reaſon to be angry, or think it ſtrange, if he converſed with his <hi>Patients</hi> among whom his proper Imployment lay.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:58790:24"/>3. They objected to him Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in breaking the Sabbath, and that ſurely was plain, that <hi>he could not be of God, if he kept not the Sabbath-day.</hi> The Truth was, he had healed one on the Sabbath-day.</p>
            <p>To this our Saviour gives a moſt reaſonable and ſatisfactory Anſwer, that ſurely <hi>it was lawful to do good on the Sabbath-day</hi>; that <hi>that</hi> was but a <hi>Poſitive Inſtitution,</hi> but works of Mercy are <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and God himſelf had declared, that he would have even his own <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> to give way to thoſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Duties, that are of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Obligation. <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi> And then from the <hi>End</hi> of the Sabbath; The Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was made for the Reſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of Man; and therefore could not be preſumed to be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his Prejudice. <hi>The Sabbath was made for Man: and not Man for the Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another great Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, was, that Perſons of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58790:25"/>
greateſt Knowledge and Authority among them, did not embrace his Doctrine. <hi>John</hi> 7.48. <hi>Have any of the Rulers or Phariſees believed on him?</hi> So that here was the <hi>infallible Rule</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> againſt him.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt, but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Authority of our Guides ought to ſway very much with us, and over-rule us in doubtful Caſes: but not againſt plain and convincing Evidence; there we ought to follow, <hi>and obey God rather than Men.</hi> There is ſometimes a viſible and palpable Corruption in thoſe who are to lead us; they may have an Intereſt to oppoſe the Truth: And thus it was with the Phariſees and Rulers at that Time: and ſo it hath been among Chriſtians in the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. The Chriſtian Religion was never more endangered, nor never more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, than by thoſe who have been in greateſt Authority in that Church, who ought to have underſtood Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legion beſt, and have been the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Support of it. <hi>Men may err</hi>:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58790:25"/>
but <hi>God cannot.</hi> So that when God ſends a Prophet, or by his Word does plainly declare his Will to us, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Example and Authority ceaſeth, and is of no force.</p>
            <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> Prejudice I ſhall mention, which the <hi>Jews</hi> had againſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Doctrine, was, that it did aboliſh and ſupercede their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as of no longer Uſe and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; though it was plain it was inſtituted by God.</p>
            <p>This had been a very ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence indeed, had not this been part of their Religion, and had not their own Prophets foretold, that the Meſſias ſhould come and perfect what was wanting and defective in their Inſtitution. It was expreſly ſaid in their Law, <hi>That God would raiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them another Prophet, like to Moſes, and that they ſhould hear him,</hi> when he came. So that in truth it was the Accompliſhment of all thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations which were made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and did not reprove the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, as <hi>falſe</hi>; but as <hi>imperfect</hi>: And did not <hi>contradict</hi> and <hi>overthrow</hi>;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58790:26"/>
but <hi>perfect and fulfil the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have gone over the chief Exceptions and Offences which the <hi>Jews</hi> took at our Saviour and his Doctrine; and I hope ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhown the Unreaſonableneſs of them. I have not now time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to what remains: But by what hath been ſaid, you may eaſily ſee, upon what ſlight and unreaſonable Grounds Men may be prejudiced againſt the beſt Perſon and Things, and yet be very confident all the while that they are in the Right. For ſo no doubt many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who oppoſed our Saviour and his Doctrine, thought themſelves to be. Therefore it concerns us to put on Meekneſs, and Humility, and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that we may able to judge im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially of things, and our Minds may be preſerved free and indifferent to receive the Truths of God, when they are offer'd to us: Otherwiſe Self-Conceit and Paſſion will ſo blind our Minds, and biaſs our Judgments, that we ſhall be unable to diſcern, and unwilling to entertain the plain,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58790:26"/>
eſt and moſt evident Truths. We ſee here by the ſad Example of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that by giving way to Paſſion, and cheriſhing Pride and Self-Conceit, Men may be ſo deeply prejudiced againſt the Truth, as to reſiſt the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Light, and reject even Salvation it ſelf, when it is offer'd to them. So that it is not in vain, that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>let every Man be ſwift to hear, and ſlow to Wrath; for the Wrath of Man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God</hi>; and exhorts us ſo earneſtly, <hi>to receive with Meekneſs the Word of God, which is able to ſave our Souls.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. Thoſe Prejudices and Objections which the World had againſt our Saviour and his Religion at their firſt Appearance; as alſo to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe which Men at this day do more eſpecially inſiſt upon, againſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58790:28"/>
the Chriſtian Religion;<note place="margin">Vol. V.</note> and to ſhow the Unreaſonableneſs of them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. How happy a thing it is to eſcape and overcome the common Prejudices which Men have againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>I have entred upon the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, the Prejudices which the World had againſt our Saviour and his Religion. When this great Teacher of Mankind came from God, though he gave all imaginable Teſtimony and Evidence that he was ſent from Heaven; yet the greateſt part of the World, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were mightily offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him, and deeply prejudiced againſt him and his Doctrine; but not both upon the ſame Account.</p>
            <p>I have already given you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the chief Exceptions which the <hi>Jews</hi> made againſt our Saviour and his Doctrine, and have ſhewn the Unreaſonableneſs of them.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to conſider the principal of thoſe Exceptions, which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> Philoſophers
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58790:28"/>
took at our Saviour and his Doctrine.<note place="margin">Ser. 2.</note> I ſhall mention theſe four.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Chriſtianity was a great Innovation, and contrary to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Inſtitutions of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They objected againſt the Plainneſs and Simplicity of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it wanted Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the low and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition of our Saviour was unſuitable to one that pretended to be the Son of God, and to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him for a Teacher and Reformer of the World. Theſe are the chief Exceptions which the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> and eſpecially their <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> took at our Saviour and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Chriſtian Religion was a great Innovation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the received Inſtitutions of the World; and conſequently that it did condemn the Religion which had been ſo univerſally received and eſtabliſh'd in the World by ſo long a continuance of Time. And no wonder if this made a great Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon them, and raiſed a mighty Prejudice in the Minds of Men
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58790:29"/>
againſt the Chriſtian Religion; no Prejudices being ſo ſtrong as thoſe that are fix'd in the Minds of Men by Education: And of all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of Education, none ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and hard to be removed, as thoſe about Religion, yea though they be never ſo groundleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable. <hi>Hath a Nation changed their Gods, which yet are no Gods?</hi> Intimating to us, that men are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly brought off from that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they have been brought up in, how abſurd ſoever it be. When Chriſtianity was firſt propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Heathen World, had Men been free and indifferent, and not prepoſſeſs'd with other Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God and Religion; it might then have been expected from them, that they ſhould have entertained it with a readineſs of Mind proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the Reaſonableneſs of it. But the Caſe was quite otherwiſe, the World had for many Ages been brought up to another way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and inur'd to Rites and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions of a quite different Nature. And this ſways very much with Men; <hi>Sequimur majores noſtros, qui feliciter
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58790:29"/>
ſequuti ſunt ſuos</hi>; as one of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens ſaid in thoſe Days; <hi>We fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our Anceſtors, who happily follow'd theirs.</hi> Men are hardly brought to condemn thoſe Opinions and Cuſtoms in Religion, which themſelves, and their Forefathers have always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and followed. And Wiſe Men eſpecially are loth to admit ſo great a change in a matter of ſo great Concernment as Religion is. So that this muſt be acknowledged to have been a conſiderable Prejudice againſt the Chriſtian Religion at its firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But yet upon a through Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, this will not be found ſufficient in Reaſon to withhold Men from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing Chriſtianity, if we conſider theſe <hi>four</hi> Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No prudent Perſon thinks that the Example and Cuſtom of his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers obligeth him to that which is evil in it ſelf, and pernicious to him that does it; and there is no Evil, no Danger equal to that of a falſe Religion; for that tends to the ruin of Men's Souls, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing for ever. A Man might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alledge the Example of his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58790:30"/>
to juſtify his Errors and Follies in any other kind, than in this, which is ſo infinitely pernicious in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In a great Corruption and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, it is no ſufficient Reaſon againſt a Reformation, that it makes a Change. When Things are amiſs, it is always fit to amend and reform them; and this cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Change. The wiſeſt among the Heathen did acknowledge, that their Religion was mixt with very great Follies and Superſtitions, and that the Lives and Manners of Men were extremely corrupt and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and they endeavour'd, as much as they could, and durſt, to reform theſe things. And therefore there was no Reaſon to oppoſe an effectual Reformation, for fear of a Change; a Change of Things for the better, tho it be uſually hard to be effected, being always a thing to be deſired and wiſh'd for.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Change which Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deſigned, was the leaſt liable to Exception that could be, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the main of it, but the reducing of Natural Religion, the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58790:30"/>
bringing of Men back to ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of God, and ſuch a way of worſhipping him, as was moſt ſuitable to the Divine Nature, and to the Natural Notions of Men's Minds; nothing elſe but a Deſign to perſuade Men of the one true God, Maker of the World, that he is a Spirit, and to be worſhipp'd in ſuch a manner, as is ſuitable to his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Nature. And then for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Practice, to bring Men to the Obedience of thoſe Precepts of Temperance, and Juſtice, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which had been univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged even by the Heathens themſelves to be the great Duties which Men owe to themſelves and others. And that this is the main Deſign of the Chriſtian Religion, the Apoſtle hath told us in moſt plain and expreſs Words, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The Grace of God</hi> (that is, the Doctrine of the Goſpel) <hi>which hath appeared to all Men, and brings Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, teacheth us, that denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:58790:31"/>And all that the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion adds beyond this, is means and helps for our Direction, and Aſſiſtance, and Encouragement in the Diſcharge and Performance of theſe Duties. For our Direction, God hath ſent his Son in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to declare his Will to us, and to be a Pattern and Example of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Virtue. For our Aſſiſtance, he hath promiſed the Aids of his Holy Spirit; and for our Encouragement, he offers to us Pardon of Sin in the Blood of his Son, and Eternal Life and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in another World. This is a ſhort Sum and Abridgment of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and there is nothing of all this that can reaſonably be excepted againſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God, conſidering the Prejudice of the Heathen againſt Chriſtianity, by reaſon of their Education in a contrary Religion, was ſtrong and violent, was pleaſed to give ſuch Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Truth of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as was of proportionable Strength and Force to remove and conquer this Prejudice. He was pleaſed to give Teſtimony to the firſt Founder of this Religion by mighty Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58790:31"/>
and particularly by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Dead: But becauſe the Report of theſe things was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to the Heathen World, and they had not ſeen theſe things themſelves; therefore he enabled thoſe who were the Witneſſes of theſe Things to the World, to work as great Miracles as he had done. And when they ſaw thoſe who gave Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to our Saviour's Miracles, do as great and ſtrange things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they teſtified of him, there was no Reaſon any longer to doubt of the Truth of their Teſtimony. So that though the Prejudice of the Heathen againſt Chriſtianity was very great, yet the Evidence which God gave to it, was ſtrong enough to remove it. The Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was ſuch as might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended it ſelf to impartial Men, by its own Reaſonableneſs: But meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with violent Prejudices in thoſe to whom it was offer'd, God was pleaſed to give ſuch a Confirmation to it, as was ſufficient to bear down thoſe Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Objection againſt Chriſtianity, was the Plainneſs and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58790:32"/>
Simplicity of the Doctrine. They expected ſome deep Speculations in Natural or Moral Philoſophy; they made full Account, a Teacher ſent from Heaven would have inſtructed them in the profoundeſt Points, and diſcourſed to them about the firſt Principles of things, and the Nature of the Soul, and the chief end of Man, with a Subtilty and Eloquence infinitely beyond that of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sophiſters, and able to bear down all Oppoſition and Contradiction: But inſtead of this, they are told a plain Story of the Life and Miracles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of his dying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, and riſing from the dead, and aſcending into Heaven; and a few plain Precepts of Life; and all this deliver'd without any Ornaments of Art, or Inſinuation of Eloquence, to gain the Favour and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of thoſe to whom they related theſe Things.</p>
            <p>But now, this truly conſidered, is ſo far from being any real Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the Chriſtian Doctrine, that it is one of the greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations that can be given of it: For matter of Fact ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58790:32"/>
in the moſt plain, and ſimple, and unaffected manner; and the leſs Art and Eloquence is uſed in the telling of a Story, the more likely it is to gain Belief. And as for our Saviour's Precepts, how plain ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they might be, I am ſure they are a Collection of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and reaſonable Rules of a good Life, and the freeſt from all Vanity and Folly, that are to be met with in any Book in the World. And can any thing be more worthy of God, and more likely to proceed from him, than ſo plain and uſeful a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as this? The Language of Law is not wont to be fine and perſuaſive, but ſhort, and plain, and full of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Thus it is among Men: And ſurely it is much fitter for God to ſpeak thus to Men, than for Men to one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is objected, that the Doctrine of our Saviour and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles wanted Demonſtration; they ſeemed to impoſe too much upon the Underſtandings of Men, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver things too Magiſterially, not demonſtrating Things from Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58790:33"/>
Arguments, but requiring Belief and Aſſent without Proof.</p>
            <p>This the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> readily acknowledgeth, that in preaching the Goſpel to the World, they did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the way of the Heathen Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Philoſophers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>My Speech and my Preaching was not in the enticing Words of Man's Wiſdom: but in Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power</hi>; that is, they did not go in the way of Human Eloquence and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: but yet their Doctrine did not want its Evidence and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though of another kind. They did not go about to bewitch Men by Eloquence, nor to entangle their Minds by ſubtil Reaſonings, the Force of which very few are capable of: But they offer'd to Men a ſenſible Proof and Demonſtration of the Truth of what they delivered, in thoſe ſtrange and miraculous Operations, to which they were enabled by the Holy Ghoſt. And this was a ſenſible Evidence, even to the meaneſt Capacity, of a Divine Aſſiſtance going along with them, and giving Teſtimony to them. I appeal to any Man, whether the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58790:33"/>
Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> from the Dead, and his Aſcending into Heaven, be not a clearer Demonſtration of another Life after this, and more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to the Capacities of all Mankind, than the fineſt and ſubtileſt Arguments that can be drawn from the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Nature of the Soul, its power of Reflection upon it ſelf, and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency upon the Body as to ſome of its Operations; which yet are ſome of the chiefeſt Arguments that Philoſophy affords, to prove the Immortality of our Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Heathens</hi> objected, that the low and mean Condition of our Saviour, was unſuitable to one that pretended to be the Son of God, and to be appointed by God to be a Teacher and Reformer of the World. This to the <hi>Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi> did not only appear unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but even ridiculous. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified, to the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the Greeks Fooliſhneſs:</hi> To think that a Man who appeared in ſuch mean Circumſtances, ſhould be fit to reform the World; and one who himſelf was put to Death, ſhould be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58790:34"/>
relied upon for Life and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>This Objection I have heretofore conſidered at large, and therefore ſhall now ſpeak but very briefly to it.</p>
            <p>Beſides thoſe excellent Reaſons and Ends which the Scripture aſſigns of our Saviour's Humiliation; as that he might be a Teacher and Example to us; that he might make Expiation for our Sins; that by ſuffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he might learn to commiſerate us; that <hi>by Death he might deſtroy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the Devil, and might deliver thoſe who through fear of Death were all their lives ſubject to Bondage</hi>; I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, it was of great uſe that he ſhould live in ſo mean and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted a Condition, to confront the Pride, and Vanity, and Fantaſtry of the World; and to convince Men of theſe two great Truths, That God may love thoſe whom he afflicts; and That Men may be innocent, and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and contented in the midſt of Poverty, and Reproach, and Suffering. Had our Bleſſed Saviour been a great Temporal Prince, his Influence and Example might poſſibly have made
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58790:34"/>
more Hypocrites and ſervile Converts; but would not have perſuaded Men one jot more to be inwardly good and virtuous. The great Arguments which muſt do that, muſt be fetch'd, not from the Pomp and Proſperity of this World, but from the Eternal Happineſs and Miſery of the other. Beſides, had he appeared in any great Power and Splendor, the Chriſtian Religion could not have been ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquitted from the Suſpicion of a worldly Intereſt and Deſign, which would have been a far greater Objection againſt it, than this which I am now ſpeaking to.</p>
            <p>Add to all this, that the wiſeſt of the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers</hi> did teach, that Worldly Greatneſs and Power are not to be admired, but deſpiſed by a truly wiſe Man; that Men may be virtuous, and good, and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved of God, and yet be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to great Miſeries and Sufferings; and that whoever ſuffers unjuſtly, and bears it patiently, gives the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Teſtimony to Goodneſs, and does moſt effectually recommend Virtue to the World; that a good Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hardeſt Circumſtances of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58790:35"/>
and Reproach, and Suffering, is the fitteſt Perſon of all other to be the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and Apoſtle, and Preacher of God to Mankind: And ſurely they who ſay ſuch things (which the <hi>Heathen</hi> have done) had no reaſon to object to our bleſſed Saviour his low and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition.</p>
            <p>As to that part of the Objection, that he who promis'd Immortality to others could not ſave himſelf from Death and Suffering, conſidering that he who was put to Death, reſcu'd himſelf from the Power of the Grave: It is ſo far from being ridiculous, that nothing can be more reaſonable than to rely upon him for our hopes of Immortality, who by riſing from the Grave, and conquering Death, gave a plain demonſtration that he was able to make good what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
            <p>I have done with the Exceptions which were made againſt our Saviour and his Doctrine at their firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the World. I proceed in the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Place to conſider the Prejudices and Objections which Men at this day do more eſpecially inſiſt upon, againſt our Saviour and his Religion: And they are many.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58790:35"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some that relate to the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To the Time of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we have not now ſufficient Evidence of the Truth of Chriſtianity; the main Arguments for it relying upon Matters of Fact, of which, at this diſtance, we have not, nor can be expected to have ſufficient Aſſurance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Terms of it ſeem very hard, and to lay too great Reſtraints upon Human Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That it is apt to diſpirit Men, and to break the Vigour and Courage of their Minds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Diviſions and Factions that are among Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The wicked Lives of the greateſt part of the Profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. In anſwer to all which, I do not propoſe to ſay all that may be ſaid, but as briefly as I can to offer ſo much, as may, if not give full Satisfaction, yet be ſufficient to break the Force of them, and to free the Minds of Men from any great Perplexity about them.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> which relates to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58790:36"/>
the Incarnation of our Saviour; and the <hi>Second</hi> to the Time of his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; I know that theſe and moſt of the reſt I have mention'd, were urged by the Heathen againſt Chriſtianity: But they are now more eſpecially inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon both by the ſecret and open Enemies of our Religion.</p>
            <p>The Objections againſt his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation I have elſewhere conſider'd.<note place="margin">Joh. 1.14. <hi>Serm.</hi> III.</note> And therefore ſhall proceed to the next, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Time of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's appearance, it is objected, If he be the only Way and Means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, why did he come no ſooner into the World; but ſuffer Mankind ſo long without any Hopes or Means of being ſaved? This was objected by <hi>Porphyry</hi> of old, and ſtill ſticks in the Minds of Men. To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not fit for Creatures to call their Creator to too ſtrict an Account of his Actions. Goodneſs is free, and may act when and how it pleaſeth; and <hi>as God will have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will have Mercy,</hi> ſo he may have Mercy at what Time he pleaſeth, and is not bound to give us
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58790:36"/>
an Account of his Matters. This is much like the Objection of the Atheiſt againſt the being of God; That if there were ſuch an Infinite and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eeing, he would ſurely have made the World ſooner, and not have been without all Employment for ſo long a duration: Such another Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this againſt our Saviour, That if he had been the Son of God, he would have begun this great and merciful Work of the Redemption of Mankind ſooner, and not have delay'd it ſo long, and ſuffer'd Mankind to periſh for four Thouſand Years together.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems in the one as well as the other, God took his own time, and he beſt knew what time was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. The Scripture tells us, That <hi>in the fulneſs of Time, God ſent his Son</hi>; when things were ripe for it, and all things accompliſht that God thought requiſite in order to it. In judging of the Actions of our Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Governours, thoſe who are at a diſtance from their Councils, what Conjectures ſoever they may make of the Reaſons of them, will never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, if they have that Reſpect for their Wiſdom which they ought,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58790:37"/>
believe, that how ſtrange ſoever ſome of their Actions may ſeem, yet they were done upon good Reaſon, and that they themſelves, if they knew the Secrets of their Counſels, ſhould think ſo. Much more do we owe that Reverence to the infinite Wiſdom of God, to believe that the Counſels of his Will are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon very good Reaſon, tho' we do not ſee many Times what it is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not true that the World was wholly deſtitute of a Way and Means of Salvation before our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's coming. Before the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was given, Men were capable of being received to the Mercy and Favour of God, upon their Obedience to the Law of Nature, and their ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the Violation of it, by virtue of <hi>the Lamb that was ſlain from the Foundation of the World.</hi> Men were ſaved by Chriſt both before and under the Law, without any particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Knowledge of him. There were Good Men in other Nations, as well as among the <hi>Jews</hi>; as <hi>Job,</hi> and his Friends alſo, ſeem to have been. In all Ages of the World, and <hi>in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation, they that feared God, and wrought Righteouſneſs were accepted of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58790:37"/>
him.</hi> The Sacrifice of Chriſt which is the Meritorious Cauſe of the Salvation of Mankind, looks back as well as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and God was reconcileable to Men, and their Sins were pardon'd, by Virtue of this great Propitiation that was to be made. In which Senſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is, that Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World, Heb.</hi> 9.25, 26. the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates to us, that if this Sacrifice which was offer'd in the laſt Ages of the World, had not been available in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, <hi>Chriſt muſt have often ſuffer'd ſince the Foundation of the World: but now hath he appeared once in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Ages, to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He did appear at that Time, in which the World ſtood moſt in need of him; when the whole World, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were ſunk into the greateſt Degeneracy both in Opinion and Practice, and the Condition of Mankind ſeemed to be even deſperate and paſt Remedy. This was the needful time, when it was moſt ſeaſonable for this great Phyſician to come, and ſhow his Pity and Skill in our Recovery. God
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58790:38"/>
could have ſent his Son many Ages before; but he thought fit to try other ways firſt, and to reſerve this powerful Remedy to the laſt; <hi>laſt of all he ſent his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Time of our Saviour's Appearing was of all Ages of the World the fitteſt Seaſon for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Whether we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the World was at that Time beſt prepared and diſpoſed for receiving the Chriſtian Religion: Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this was the fitteſt Seaſon that ever had been, for the eaſie diffuſing and propagating of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. I aſſign theſe reaſons as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to give Men ſome Satisfaction, why this great Bleſſing was delay'd ſo long; it being rather an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Wiſdom and Goodneſs, than of the want of either, to defer Things to that time, in which they are moſt likely to have their effect. Not but that perhaps other and better Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be given. To be ſure God had very good Reaſons for this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, whether we can hit upon them or not. In the mean Time
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58790:38"/>
theſe ſeem not to be altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the World was at that time beſt prepared and diſpoſed for receiving the Chriſtian Religion. All the while our Saviour's Coming was delay'd God's Providence was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing things for it, and training up Mankind for the entertaining of this great Bleſſing. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was always very burdenſom, but much more ſo, towards the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, partly by the Intolerable Multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Obſervances, which were dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly multiplied upon them, under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Traditions from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and partly by reaſon of their Subjection to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which made the Exerciſe of their Religion in many reſpects more difficult.</p>
            <p>And the Heathen World was in a very good Meaſure prepared for Chriſtianity, by being civilized. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of our Saviour's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World, Philoſophy and Learning had been ſo diffuſed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueſts, as had brought a great part of the World from Barbariſm to Civility. Beſides
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58790:39"/>
that their Philoſophy had this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon Men, to refine their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in a good Degree to detect the Follies of the Heathen Idolatry and Superſtition.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed Learning and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy flouriſht a great while before in the Time of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, and perhaps before that in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations; and the Conqueſts of the <hi>Grecians</hi> were very ſpeedy and of vaſt Extent: But yet they were neither ſo Univerſal, nor ſo well ſettled; nor did they propagate their Philoſophy and Civility together with their Conqueſts, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did. So that there was no Age of the World, wherein Mankind were ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally prepared and diſpoſed for the receiving of the Goſpel, as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Saviour appeared.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This was likewiſe the fitteſt Seaſon for the eaſie diffuſing and propagating of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Romans,</hi> together with their Conqueſts, did very much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their Language, which made the ways of Communication far more eaſie; And by the long and frequent Correſpondence of the ſeveral Parts
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58790:39"/>
of that Empire one with another, the ways of Travel and Paſſage from one Country to another were more ready and open. So that no Age can be inſtanc'd, in all Reſpects ſo convenient for the ſpeedy propagating of a new Religion, as that wherein our Saviour appear'd, <hi>viz.</hi> when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire was at its height. And it was very agreeable to the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of the Divine Providence, that the braveſt and moſt virtuous People in the World (infinitely beyond either the <hi>Perſians</hi> or <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) ſhould be choſen by God, as one of the chiefeſt Means for the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the beſt and moſt perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation that ever God made to the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is objected, That we have not now ſufficient Evidence of the Truth of Chriſtianity, the main Arguments for it relying upon matters of Fact, of which at this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, we have not, nor can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have, ſufficient Aſſurance. To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That men not only may have, but have an undoubted Aſſurance of matters of Fact, ancienter than theſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58790:40"/>
we are ſpeaking of; and the diſtance of them from our Times creates no manner of Scruple in the Minds of Men concerning them. That there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and that he conquer'd <hi>Darius</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi>; That <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> invaded our Nation, and in ſome meaſure ſubdued it; and that he overcame <hi>Pompey</hi> in the Battel of <hi>Pharſalia</hi>; and innumerable other Things which I might inſtance in, that were done before our Saviour's Time, are firmly believed without any manner of Doubt and Scruple by Mankind, notwithſtanding they were done ſo long ago. So that ancient matters of Fact are capable of clear Evidence, and we may have ſufficient Aſſurance of them. And where there is equal Evidence, if we do not give equal Belief, the fault is not in the Argument, but in the Paſſion or Prejudice of thoſe, to whom it is propoſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have every whit as great Aſſurance, (nay greater, if it can, or needed to be) of the matters upon which the proof of Chriſtianity relies, as of thoſe which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58790:40"/>
I have mentioned. The matters of Fact, upon which the Truth of Chriſtianity relies, are, that there was ſuch a Perſon as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; that he wrought ſuch Miracles; that he was put to death at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi>; that he roſe again from the dead, and was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly taken up into Heaven; that he beſtowed miraculous Gifts and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon the Apoſtles, to make them competent Witneſſes of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and of the Truth of that Doctrine which they publiſht in his Name; that accordingly they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel to the World, and in a ſhort ſpace, without any Human Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, did propagate it, and gain Entertainment for it, in moſt parts of the then known World.</p>
            <p>Now theſe matters of Fact have the ſame Teſtimony of Hiſtories, wrote in thoſe Times, and conveyed down to us, by as general and uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Tradition, as the Conqueſts of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> So that if we do not afford equal Belief to them, it is a ſign that we have ſome Prejudice or Intereſt againſt the one, more than againſt the other, though
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58790:41"/>
the Evidence for both be equal. Nay I go further, that the Evidence for theſe things which are the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtianity, is ſo much the greater, becauſe that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon it, was of far greater Concernment to the World, and conſequently Mankind were more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſearch more narrowly into it.</p>
            <p>For our Saviour's Life, and Death, and Reſurrection, we have the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a great number of Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes, who have wrote the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of theſe things. And though they were truly extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and gave Teſtimony to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Miracles; yet at preſent I deſire no more, but that they be looked upon, as knowing and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Relators of what they heard and ſaw; and that the ſame Credit be given to them, which we give to <hi>Livy,</hi> and <hi>Arian,</hi> and <hi>Q. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> for plain Events, and matters of Fact.</p>
            <p>But yet I muſt add withal, that beſides the Miracles which they wrought, they gave greater Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Integrity, than any
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58790:41"/>
Hiſtorian in the World ever did. For they willingly ſuffer'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Perſecution and Torment, yea and Death it ſelf, in Confirmation of the Truth of what they deliver'd. And for the propagating of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion through ſo great a part of the World, it is evident by the Effect beyond all Denial.</p>
            <p>So that for the matters of Fact, upon which the Truth of Chriſtianity does depend, here is greater, and more advantagious Evidence of Hiſtory, than for any other Matter of equal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the ſubſtance of theſe matters of Fact, we have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring Teſtimony of the greateſt Enemies of the Chriſtian Religion. That there were ſuch Perſons as our Saviour and his Apoſtles, that they preached ſuch a Doctrine, that they wrought ſuch Miracles; for this we have the Acknowledgment of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Teſtimony of the Heathen Hiſtorians, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Porphyry,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> who were the particular and moſt learned Adverſaries of the Chriſtian Religion. So that as to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58790:42"/>
the Matters of Fact, there is no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt them, whatever uſe we may make of them, or whatever Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences we may draw from them. And I preſume it agreed by all Objectors, that if theſe matters of Fact be true, they are a ſufficient Foundation of the Truth of our Religion, and we are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to our Religion, if we make a doubt of theſe things, which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Enemies of Chriſtianity never had the Face to deny.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And beſides all this, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the Diſadvantage which we have of thoſe who ſaw the Miracles of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, we have the <hi>Teſtimonium rei,</hi> the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Effects of theſe things to confirm our Belief of them; and this is an Advantage which the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity could not have. We ſee our Saviour's Predictions of the Succeſs of his Religion in the World, in the propagating and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of it, fully accompliſht, notwithſtanding the fierce Oppoſition and Reſiſtance that was made againſt it by the greateſt Powers of the World. We ſee the Diſperſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> in all Nations, and the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58790:42"/>
Miſery and Contempt which they every where ſuffer; and that now for above Sixteen Hundred Years, they have continued a diſtinct Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a Spectacle of the Divine Juſtice and Severity, for rejecting and crucifying the Son of God, and for a laſting and ſtanding Teſtimony of the Truth of our Saviour's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>So that though we live at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the firſt riſe and beginning of Chriſtianity; yet we have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thoſe Things, which give Confirmation to it, conveyed down to us in as credible a manner, as any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient matter of Fact ever was; and the Effects of things remaining to this day, do give Teſtimony to the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is objected, that the terms of Chriſtianity ſeem very hard, and to lay too great reſtraints upon Human Nature. It commands us to mortify our Luſts, and ſubdue our Paſſions, and <hi>deny <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, and to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World; to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all manner of Converſation; to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58790:43"/>
have reſpect to whatever things are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and true, and juſt, and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and of good report; and to deny our ſelves</hi>; and to part with the deareſt Enjoyments of this Life, <hi>yea and with Life it ſelf, for the ſake of Chriſt, and his Goſpel.</hi> Now theſe ſeem to be very hard Terms, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go all the preſent Pleaſures and Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Life, in hopes of a future Happineſs which we are leſs aſſur'd of.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this is a greater Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Religion in general, than the Chriſtian Religion. For Natural Religion requires of us all the main Duties that Chriſtianity does, and gives us far leſs Aſſurance of the Reward of our Obedience. Natural Religion requires Piety, and Juſtice, and Charity, the due Government of our Appetites and Paſſions, as well as Chriſtianity does; but does not diſcover to us the Rewards of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World, by many Degrees ſo clearly, as our Lord and Saviour, who hath <hi>brought Life and Immortality to Light by the Goſpel,</hi> and by his Reſurrection from the Dead, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58790:43"/>
Aſcenſion into Heaven, hath given us full Aſſurance of another Life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, and of a glorious Immortality. So that though we have not, nor can have the Evidence of Senſe, for a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, yet we have all the Rational Evidence for it, that can be wiſht or expected; and much more than Men have for thoſe Adventures of their Lives and Fortunes, which they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make in this World, and think themſelves reaſonable in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Reſtraints which Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity lays upon Men, are in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mankind ſo far from being an Objection againſt it, that they are highly to the Commendation of it. Nay it were the greateſt Objection that could be againſt our Religion, if it did ſet us at Liberty from thoſe Reſtraints. What can be more to the credit of any Religion, than to command Men to be juſt, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, and peaceable? And what more to the Advantage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it? And on the contrary, what can reflect more upon any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than to indulge and allow Men in any Vice contrary to theſe?
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58790:44"/>
It ſhews Men are glad to make any thing an Objection againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity when they lay hold of that, which, if it had been otherwiſe, they would have made ten times more Clamour againſt it for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for moſt of thoſe Reſtraints which Chriſtianity lays upon us, they are of that Nature, ſo much both for our Private and Publick Advantage, that ſetting aſide all Conſiderations of Religion, and of the Rewards and Puniſhments of another Life, they are really good for us, and if God had not laid them upon us, we ought in Reaſon, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Temporal Benefit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to have laid them upon our ſelves. If there were no Religion, I know Men would not have ſuch ſtrong and forcible Obligations to theſe Duties; but yet I ſay, though there were no Religion, it were good for Men, in order to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Ends, to their Health, and Quiet, and Reputation, and Safety, and, in a word, to the private and publick Proſperity of Mankind, that Men ſhould be temperate, and chaſte,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58790:44"/>
and juſt, and peaceable, and charitable, and kind, and obliging to one another, rather than the contrary. So that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion does not create thoſe Reſtraints arbitrarily, but requires thoſe things of us, which our Reaſon, and a regard to our own Advantage, which the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Conveniency of the Things themſelves, without any Conſideration of Religion, would in moſt Caſes urge us to.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the caſe of Perſecution for Religion; beſides that it does not now happen ſo frequently as it did in the beginning of Chriſtianity, nay very ſeldom in compariſon, if all things be conſider'd, it cannot be thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, both becauſe Religion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to us, in Conſideration of our preſent Sufferings, a Happineſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably greater than that which we forego for the ſake of Religion; and becauſe when it happens, God does extraordinarily enable Men to go through it with Courage and Comfort, as we ſee in the Examples of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians; who in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of all Tempers and Ages, did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily chuſe to give up themſelves
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58790:45"/>
to theſe Sufferings, when there was no neceſſity laid upon them, but fair terms of Retreat were offer'd to them by their Enemies. It is one thing when a Man ſuffers by the Law, and cannot help it; and another thing when Men may avoid ſuffering. In the former Caſe Men ſubmit to neceſſity, and bear it as well as they can; in the latter Caſe, if Men ſuffer, it is a ſign they firmly believe the Reward of it; and if they ſuffer chearfully, and with Joy, as moſt of the Martyrs did, it is a plain Evidence that God affords them extraordinary Support in their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and then the Caſe is not very hard, when Religion puts them upon nothing, but what it gives them cauſe, and enables them, to rejoice in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is objected, That the Chriſtian Religion is apt to diſpirit Men, and to break the Courage and Vigor of their Minds, by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Patience, and Humility, and Meekneſs, and of forgiving Injuries, and the like. This Objection hath made a great Noiſe in the World, and hath been urged by Men of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58790:45"/>
great Reputation, and a deep inſight into the Tempers of Men, and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the World. It is ſaid to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly inſiſted upon by <hi>Machiavel,</hi> and very likely it may; though I think that elſewhere he is pleaſed to ſpeak with Terms of Reſpect, not only of Religion in general, but likewiſe of the Chriſtian Religion; and (which ſeems very much to contradict the other) he ſays in the firſt Book of his Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon <hi>Livy,</hi> (Ch. 11.) That the Greatneſs and Succeſs of <hi>Rome</hi> is chiefly to be aſcribed to their Piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and that <hi>Rome</hi> was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> for ſettling Religion among them, than to <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the Founder of their State; and the Reaſon he gives is much to our preſent Purpoſe; For, ſays he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Religion there can be no Military Diſcipline, Religion being the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good Laws and good Diſcipline. And particularly he commends the <hi>Samnites,</hi> who betook themſelves to Religion, as their laſt and beſt Remedy to make Men couragious, nothing being more apt to raiſe Men's Spirits than Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:58790:46"/>But howſoever this Objection be. I dare appeal both to Reaſon and Experience for the Confutation of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To Reaſon, and that as to theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That the Chriſtian Religion is apt to plant in the Minds of Men Principles of the greateſt Reſolution and trueſt Courage. It teacheth Men upon the beſt and moſt rational Grounds to deſpiſe Dangers, yea and Death it ſelf, the greateſt and moſt formidable Evil in this World; and this Principle is likely to inſpire Men with the greateſt Courage; for what need he fear any thing in this World, who fears not Death, after which there is nothing in this World to be feared? And this the Chriſtian Religion does, by giving Men the aſſurance of another Life, and a Happineſs infinitely great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than any is to be enjoyed in this World. And in order to the ſecuring of this Happineſs, it teacheth Men to be holy, and juſt, and to exerciſe a good Conſcience both toward God and Man, which is the only way to free a Man from all inward and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58790:46"/>
Fears of what may happen to him after Death. <hi>This makes the righteous Man</hi> to be (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays) <hi>bold as a Lion.</hi> Nothing renders a Man more undaunted as to Death, and the Conſequences of it, than the Peace of his own Mind; for a Man not to be conſcious to himſelf of having wilfully diſpleaſed him, who alone can make us happy or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in the other World. So that a good Man, being ſecure of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, may upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count reaſonably hope for a greater Happineſs after Death than other Men: Whereas a bad Man, if he be ſober, and have his Senſes awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to a ſerious Conſideration of things, cannot but be afraid to dye, and be extremely anxious and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous what will become of him in another World. And ſurely it would make the ſtouteſt Man breathing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to venture upon Death, when he ſees Hell beyond it. Poſſibly there may be ſome Monſters of Men, who may have ſo far ſuppreſs'd the Senſe of Religion, and ſtupified their Conſciences, as in a good Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to have conquer'd the fears of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58790:47"/>
Death, and of the Conſequences of it. But this happens but to a very few, as the Poet tells us in the Perſon of an <hi>Epicurean.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Felix qui potuit rerum cognoſcere cauſas,</l>
               <l>Atque metus omnes &amp; inexorabile fatum</l>
               <l>Subjecit pedibus, ſtrepitum<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Acherontis avari.</l>
            </q>
            <p>There are very few that attain to this Temper, and but at ſome times. So that if Vice and Wickedneſs do generally break the Firmneſs of Men's Spirits; it remains, that nothing but Religion can generally give Men Courage againſt Death. And this the Chriſtian Religion does eminently to thoſe who live according to it; our bleſſed Saviour having delivered us from the fear of Death, by conquering Death for us, and giving us Aſſurance of the glorious Rewards of another Life.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Meekneſs, and Patience, and Humility, and Modeſty, and ſuch Virtues of Chriſtianity, do not in Reaſon tend to diſpirit Men, and break their true Courage, but only
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58790:47"/>
to regulate it, and take away the Fierceneſs and Bruitiſhneſs of it. This we ſee in Experience, that Men of the trueſt Courage, have many times leaſt of Pride and Inſolence, of Paſſion and Fierceneſs. Thoſe who are better bred, are commonly of more gentle and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Diſpoſitions: But yet they do not therefore want true Courage, though they have not the Roughneſs and Fool-hardineſs of Men of ruder Breeding. So in a true Chriſtian, Courage and Greatneſs of Mind is very conſiſtent with Meekneſs, and Patience, and Humility. Not that all good Men are very couragious; there is much of this in the Natural Tempers of Men, which Religion does not quite alter. But that which I am concerned to maintain is, that Chriſtianity is no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to Mens Courage; and that <hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris paribus,</hi> ſuppoſing Men of equal Tempers, no Man hath ſo much Reaſon to be valiant, as he that hath a good Conſcience; I do not mean a bluſtering, and boiſterous, and raſh Courage; but a ſober, and calm, and fixt Valour.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:58790:48"/>2. I appeal to Experience for the Truth of this. Did ever greater Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Contempt of Death appear in all Ages, and Sexes, and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men, than in the primitive Martyrs? Were any of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Soldiers comparable to the Chriſtian <hi>Legion,</hi> for Reſolution and Courage, even the <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves being Judges? The Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſeems to be contrived to inſpire Men with Fierceneſs and Deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Reſolution, and yet I do not find, but that generally where there hath been any equality for Number, the Chriſtians have been ſuperior to them in Valour, and have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven greater Inſtances of Reſolution and Courage, than the <hi>Turks</hi> have done. So that I wonder upon what Grounds this Objection hath been taken up againſt Chriſtianity, when there is nothing either in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Religion, or from the Experience of the World, to give any tolerable Countenance to it. And ſurely the beſt way to know what Effect any Religion is likely to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58790:48"/>
have upon the Minds of Men, is to conſider what Effects it hath had in the conſtant Experience of Mankind. There remains the other two Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which I mention'd, but I muſt reſerve them to another Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>

            <p n="1">I. The Prejudices and Objections which the World at firſt had, and many ſtill have againſt our Bleſſed Saviour and his Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That it is a great Happineſs to eſcape the common Prejudices which Men are apt to entertain againſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:58790:50"/>
               <note place="margin">Vol. V.</note>I have conſidered thoſe Objections which the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> made againſt our Saviour and his Religion: And,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thoſe which at this Day are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon by the ſecret and open Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Religion. And I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ſeven,</hi> the <hi>two</hi> laſt of which I ſhall now ſpeak to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is objected, That there are many Diviſions and Factions among Chriſtians. This I confeſs is a great Reproach and Scandal to our Religion: but no ſufficient Argument againſt it. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To leſſen and abate the Force of this Objection, it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that a very great part of the Diviſions that are among thoſe that are call'd Chriſtians, are about things that do not concern the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and therefore they are no Argument that Chriſtianity is not true, becauſe they bring no Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Doubt and Uncertainty upon the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, which all agree in, though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in other things. 'Tis true indeed they are very undecent, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Nature and Precepts of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58790:50"/>
Chriſtian Religion,<note place="margin">Ser. 3.</note> which above any Religion in the World, does ſtrictly require Love and Unity. They take off much from the Strength and Beauty of our Religion: but do by no means deſtroy the Truth of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How many and great ſoever they may be, yet they can with no Colour of Reaſon be imputed to the Chriſtian Religion, as giving any Cauſe and Encouragement to them, however by Accident it may be the Occaſion of them. For no Man doubts but that the beſt thing in the World may be perverted by bad Men, and made an Occaſion of a great deal of Miſchief in the World, and yet be very innocent of all that Miſchief. No Man can deny but that Chriſtianity does ſtrictly enjoin Love, and Peace, and Unity among all the Members of that Profeſſion; and ſo far as Chriſtians are factious and unpeaceable, ſo far they are no Chriſtians. So that a Man may as well except againſt Philoſophy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Differences that were among the Philoſophers, and ſay there was no Truth among them, becauſe they were not all agreed in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58790:51"/>
all Things; as call the Truth of Chriſtianity in queſtion, for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that are among Chriſtians. Nay, a Man might every whit as well except againſt Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; becauſe, notwithſtanding them, there are frequent Seditions and Rebellions, infinite Suits and Controverſies occaſion'd even by the very Laws: But no Man was ever ſo unreaſonable as to think this a good Reaſon againſt Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Diviſions of Chriſtians are ſo far from being an Argument againſt Chriſtianity, that on the contrary, they are an Argument that Men ſhould embrace Chriſtianity more heartily, and make more Conſcience of obeying the Precepts of it. And if they did this, the greateſt part of thoſe Contentions and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Animoſities which are among them would preſently ceaſe. If the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion were truly entertained, and Men did ſeriouſly mind the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of it, and give up themſelves to the Obedience of its Laws, Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences would not be eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, nor ſo vehemently proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58790:51"/>
nor ſo pertinaciouſly continued in, as they are. Men would not, upon every ſlight Reaſon, and little Doubt and Scruple, rend and tear the Body of Chriſt in pieces, and ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Communion of the Church they live in, and in which they were baptized and received their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>
            <p>If Men ſeriouſly conſider'd, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood what they do, when they divide the Church of Chriſt upon lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Scruples and Pretences, they would hardly be able to think themſelves Chriſtians, whilſt they continued in theſe unchriſtian and uncharitable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</p>
            <p>If Men would but be, or do what Chriſtianity requires, there would be no occaſion for this Objection; and if Men will not, Chriſtian Religion is not to be blamed for it, but thoſe that act ſo contrary to the plain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Directions of it. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventh</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> Objection, The vicious and wicked Lives of a great part of the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity. This is a heavy Objection indeed, and ſuch an one, that though we may
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58790:52"/>
juſtly be aſhamed to own the Truth of it, yet can we not have the face to deny it. 'Tis ſo ſad a Truth, that it is enough to confound us, and to fill all our Faces with Shame and Bluſhing: But yet it is an Objection not ſo ſtrong againſt Chriſtianity, as it is ſhameful to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And notwithſtanding the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Force of it, we have no cauſe to be aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt; but the Goſpel of Chriſt may juſtly be aſhamed of us. For whatever we be, <hi>The Goſpel of Chriſt is the power of God unto Salvation.</hi> The Natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of it is to reform and ſave Men, and <hi>the wrath of God is therein revealed againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men, however they may detain the Truths of God in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> and not ſuffer them to have their due and proper Influence upon their Hearts and Lives.</p>
            <p>But that I may give a more clear and particular Anſwer to it, I deſire you to attend to theſe following Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot be denied, but that Chriſtianity hath had once very great and marvellous Effects upon the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58790:52"/>
Hearts and Lives of Men. And for this, I appeal to the Lives and Manners of the Primitive Chriſtians, for which we have not only the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of our own Books and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but even of the Adverſaries of our Religion. What Reformation Chriſtianity at firſt wrought in the Manners of Men, we have clear and full Teſtimony, from what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles wrote concerning the ſeveral Churches which they planted in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of the World. What hearty Unity und Affection there was among Chriſtians, even to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to make Men bring in their private Eſtates and Poſſeſſions for the common Support of their Brethren, we may read in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles. The City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> by the Account which <hi>Strabo</hi> gives of it, was a very vicious and luxurious place, as moſt in the World; and yet we ſee by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> what a ſtrange Reformation the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion made in the Lives and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of many of them: 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Be not deceived; neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, nor adulterers, nor idolaters, nor effeminate, nor thieves, nor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58790:53"/>
nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God. And ſuch were ſome of you: But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but ye are juſtified, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> And ſurely it is no ſmall matter to reclaim Men from ſuch a profligate courſe of Life. The Apoſtle inſtanceth in Crimes and Vices of the firſt Rate, from which yet he tells us many were cleanſed and purified <hi>by the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and the Spirit of God</hi>; that is, by the Power and Efficacy of the Chriſtian Doctrine, together with the Co-operation of God's Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>After the Apoſtles, the Ancient Fathers, in their Apologies for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, give us a large Account of the great Power and Efficacy of the Chriſtian Doctrine upon the Lives and Manners of Men. <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells the <hi>Roman</hi> Governors, that their Priſons were full of Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, committed for ſeveral Crimes; but they were all <hi>Heathens. De ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris ſemper aeſtuat carcer, Their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were thronged with Criminals of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58790:53"/>
their own Religion:</hi> But there were no Chriſtians to be found commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there for ſuch Crimes; <hi>Nemo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Chriſtianus, niſi hoc tantùm,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There were no Chriſtians in their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but only upon account of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> Or if there were any Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors that had been Chriſtians, they left their Religion when they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Enormities. And afterwards he adds, that if Chriſtians were ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular in their Lives, they were no longer accounted Chriſtians, but were baniſh'd from their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as unworthy of it. And they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the <hi>Heathens,</hi> what a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſtrange change Chriſtianity had made in ſeveral of the moſt lewd, and vicious, and debauched Perſons, and what a viſible Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation there preſently appeared in the Lives of the worſt Men, after they had once entertained the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>And theſe Teſtimonies are ſo much the ſtronger, becauſe they are Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Appeals to our Adverſaries, which it is not likely they who were ſo perſecuted and hated as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were, would have had the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58790:54"/>
Confidence to have made, if they had not been notoriouſly true, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their Enemies themſelves being Judges.</p>
            <p>And that they were ſo, we have the Confeſſion of the <hi>Heathen</hi> themſelves. I ſhall produce two remarkable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to this Purpoſe, and one of them from the Pen of one of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt Enemies that the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ever had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor, gives him an Account,
<q>That having examined the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſetting aſide the Superſtition of their way, he could find no Fault; and that this was the Sum of their Error, That they were wont to meet before Day, and ſing a Hymn to Chriſt, and to bind themſelves by Solemn Oath or Sacrament, not to any wicked Purpoſe; but not to ſteal, nor rob, nor commit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor break their Faith, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Pledge.</q>
So that it ſeems the Sum of their Error was, to oblige themſelves in the ſtricteſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt the greateſt Vices and Crimes. Which methinks is a great Teſtimony from an Enemy and a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58790:54"/>
Judge, one who would have been ready to diſcover their Faults, and had Opportunity of enquiring into them.</p>
            <p>My other Witneſs is <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperor and Apoſtate, who in one of his Epiſtles tells us,
<q>The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did ſeverely puniſh Sedition and Impiety.</q>
And afterwards exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Heathen</hi> Prieſts to all Offices of Humanity, and eſpecially Alms to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Poor; he tells them, they ought to be more careful in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and to mend this Fault; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Galileans taking advantage of our Neglect in this kind, have very much ſtrengthned their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety</hi> (for ſo he calls their Religion) <hi>by being very intent upon theſe Offices, and exemplary in their Charity to the Poor, whereby they gained many over to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in his 49th Epiſt. to <hi>Arſaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the High-Prieſt of <hi>Galatia,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to him, among other Means for the Advancement of Paganiſm, the building of Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and great Liberality to the Poor, not only of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but others. <hi>For,</hi> ſays he,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58790:55"/>
               <hi>it is a Shame that the impious Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould not only maintain their own poor, but ours alſo; wherefore let us not ſuffer them to outdo us in this Virtue.</hi> Nothing but the force of Truth could have extorted ſo full an Acknowledgment of the great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and Charity of the Chriſtians, from ſo bitter an Enemy of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as <hi>Julian</hi> was. If he owned it, we may be ſure it was very great and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary.</p>
            <p>So that you ſee that the Chriſtian Religion had a very great Power and Efficacy upon the Lives and Manners of Men, when it firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the World. And the true Spirit and Genius of any Religion, the Force of any Inſtitution is beſt ſeen in the primitive Effects of it; before it be weakned and diſpirited by thoſe Corruptions, which in time are apt to inſinuate themſelves into the beſt things. For all Laws and Inſtitutions are commonly more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, and have greater Effects at firſt, than afterwards; and the beſt things are apt in time to degenerate and to contract Soil and Ruſt. And it cannot in Reaſon be expected o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58790:55"/>
So that though it be a thing to be bewailed, and by the greateſt Care and Diligence to be reſiſted, yet it is not ſo extremely to be wonder'd at, if Chriſtianity, in the ſpace of Sixteen Hundred Years, hath abated much of its firſt Strength and Vigor.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially conſidering, that there were ſeveral Circumſtances, that gave Chriſtianity mighty Advantages at firſt, eſpecially the miraculous Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which did accompany the firſt Publication of the Goſpel; which muſt needs be full of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe who ſaw the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Effects of it: The extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Operation of the Spirit of God upon the Minds of Men, to diſpoſe them to the receiving of it: The perſecuted and ſuffering State that Chriſtians were generally in, which made thoſe who embraced the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to be generally ſerious and in good earneſt in it, and kept up a continual Heat and Zeal in the Minds of Men for that Religion which coſt them ſo dear, and for which they ſuffer'd ſo much: And the fury of their Enemies againſt it,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58790:56"/>
did naturally inflame their Love and Kindneſs to one another; nothing being a greater Endearment among Men, than common Sufferings in a common Cauſe. So long as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were not corrupted by Secular Intereſts; and by denying all for Chriſt, were free from Covetouſneſs and Ambition, the great roots of all Evil, the Church of Chriſt, <hi>though ſhe was black, yet ſhe was comely, and terrible, as an Army with Banners</hi>; She was all this while in an excellent Poſture to reſiſt the Temptations, and fight againſt the Vices and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the World: But after the World broke in upon the Church, and Chriſtianity was countenanced by the Powers of the World, and water'd with Secular Preferments and Encouragements, no wonder if the <hi>Tares</hi> began to grow up with the <hi>Wheat</hi>; Then <hi>Iniquity began to abound, and the Love of many to grow cold.</hi> When the Sun of Proſperity began to ſhine upon the Chriſtian Profeſſion, then no wonder if the Vermin bred and ſwarmed every where. When it grew creditable and advantagious for Men to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58790:56"/>
this muſt in all Reaſon make a World of Hypocrites, and counterfeit Profeſſors.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, I reckon, muſt in Reaſon make a mighty Difference between the firſt Ages of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and thoſe which have follow'd ſince; and no wonder, if the real Fruits and Effects of Religion in theſe ſeveral States of Chriſtianity be very unequal. For Proſperity and Adverſity made a wide difference in this Matter. The Perſecution of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion naturally makes the Profeſſors of it real; and the Proſperity of it does as naturally allure and draw in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. Beſides that even the beſt of Men are more corrupted by Proſperity, than Affliction.</p>
            <p>But though Chriſtians were beſt under Perſecution, yet God did not think fit always to continue them in that State, becauſe he would not tempt them, and tire them out with perpetual Sufferings; and after he had given the World a ſufficient Experiment of the Power and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Chriſtian Religion, in maintaining and propagating it ſelf in deſpite of all the Violence and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58790:57"/>
Oppoſition of the World, ſufficient for ever to give Reputation to it; he then thought good to leave it to be kept up by more Human Ways, and ſuch as offer leſs violence to the Nature of a Man. Being once eſtabliſh'd and ſettled in the World, and upon equal Terms of Advantage with other Religions, God left it to be ſupported by more ordinary Means; by pious Education, and diligent Inſtruction, and good Laws and Government, without Miracles, and without Perſecution, and without thoſe extraordinary and overpowering Communications of his Grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which he afforded to the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>I have inſiſted the longer upon this, that Men may ſee what Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects Chriſtianity hath had upon the Lives of Men, by which we may ſee the proper Nature and Efficacy of it; and withal may not wonder ſo much that it hath not the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects now. Though it be matter of great Shame to us, that they are ſo vaſtly diſproportionable to what they were at firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:58790:57"/>2. Though the Diſproportion be very great between the Effects of Chriſtianity at firſt, and what it hath now upon the Lives of Men; yet we ought not to deny, but it hath ſtill ſome good Effects upon Mankind; and it is our great Shame and Fault that it hath no better. If we will ſpeak juſtly of things, as to the general civility of Life and Manners, Freedom from Tyranny, and Barbarouſneſs, and Cruelty, and ſome other enormous Vices, yea and as to the exemplary Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of great Numbers of particular Perſons of ſeveral Nations, there is no Compariſon between the general State of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> and <hi>Mahometan</hi> parts of the World. Next to Chriſtianity, and the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to one Nation) Philoſophy was the moſt likely Inſtrument to reform Mankind that hath been in the World; and it had very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Effects upon ſome particular Perſons, both as to the rectifying of their Opinions, and the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Lives: But upon the generality of Mankind it did very
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58790:58"/>
little in either of theſe Reſpects, eſpecially as to the rectifying of the abſurd and impious Opinions of the People concerning God, and their ſuperſtitious Worſhip of the Deity. Whereas the Chriſtian Religion did univerſally, where-ever it came, ſet Men free from thoſe groſs Impieties and Superſtitions, and taught Men to worſhip the only true God in a right Manner.</p>
            <p>Though we muſt confeſs, to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reproach of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church hath degenerated ſo far, that it ſeems to be in a great Meaſure relaps'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ignorance and Superſtition of Paganiſm; out of which Degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that God hath reſcued us, as we have infinite Cauſe to adore his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo we have all the reaſon in the World to dread and deteſt a Return into this ſpiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> this Houſe of Darkneſs and Bondage, and the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Necks again under <hi>that Toke, which neither we nor our Fathers were able to bear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that you ſee that there are ſtill very conſiderable Effects of the Chriſtian Religion in the World,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58790:58"/>
yea and I doubt not but in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where it is moſt corrupted and degenerated; becauſe they ſtill retain the eſſential Doctrines of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which have not quite loſt their Force, notwithſtanding the many Errors and Corruptions that are mixt with them. And as God knows, and every Man ſees it, that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſtians are very bad, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Influence of that excellent Religion which they profeſs; yet I think it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Men would be much worſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. For though very many who have entertained the Principles of Chriſtianity are very wicked in their Lives; yet many are otherwiſe: And thoſe that are bad have this Advantage by their Religion, that it is in its Nature apt to reduce and recover Men from a wicked Courſe, and ſometimes does: Whereas the caſe of thoſe Perſons would have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, were it not for thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in them by Chriſtian Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and though they were long ſuppreſs'd, yet did at laſt awaken them to a Conſideration of their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58790:59"/>
Condition, and proved the happy Means of their Recovery.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I will not deny but there are ſome Perſons as bad, nay perhaps worſe, that have been bred up in the Chriſtian Religion, than are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found in the Darkneſs of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm; for the Corruption of the beſt Things is the worſt, and thoſe who have reſiſted ſo great a Light as that of the Goſpel is, are like to prove the moſt deſperately wicked of all other. There is nothing that Men make worſe uſe of, than of Light and Liberty, two of the beſt and moſt pleaſant Things in the World. Knowledge is many times abuſed to the worſt Purpoſe, and Liberty into Licentiouſneſs and Sedition; and yet no Man for all that thinks Ignorance deſirable, or would wiſh a perpetual Night and Darkneſs to the World; and conclude from the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of abuſed Liberty, that the beſt State of things would be, that the generality of Mankind ſhould be all Slaves to a few, and be perpetually chained to the Oar, or condemned to the Mines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:58790:59"/>There are many times as bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of good things, as of bad: but yet there is a great difference between good and bad for all that. As Knowledge and Liberty, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Chriſtian Religion is a great Happineſs to the World in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, though ſome are ſo unhappy as to be the worſe for it; not becauſe Religion is bad, but becauſe they are ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If Religion be a matter of Mens free Choice, it is not to be expected that it ſhould neceſſarily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly have its Effect upon Men; for it works upon us, not by way of Force or natural Neceſſity, but of Moral Perſuaſion. If Religion, and the Grace of God which goes along with it, did force Men to be good and virtuous, and no Man could be ſo unleſs he were thus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently forc'd, then it would be no Virtue in any Man to be good, nor any Crime and Fault to be otherwiſe. For then the reaſon why ſome Men were good, would be becauſe they could not help it; and others bad, becauſe the Grace of God did not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58790:60"/>
make them ſo whether they would or not.</p>
            <p>But Religion does not thus work upon Men. It directs Men to their Duty by the ſhorteſt and plaineſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of a good Life; it perſuades Men to the Obedience of theſe Precepts, by the Promiſes of Eternal Happineſs, and the Threatnings of Eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in caſe of obſtinate Diſobedience; it offers us the Aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit, to help our Weakneſs, and enable us to that, for which <hi>we are not ſufficient of our ſelves:</hi> But there is nothing of Violence or Neceſſity in all this. After all, Men may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey theſe Precepts, and not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by theſe Arguments, may not make uſe of this Grace which God offers, may <hi>quench and reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>reject the Counſel of God againſt themſelves.</hi> And the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, it is no wonder, if the Temptations of this preſent World pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon the vicious Inclinations of Men againſt their Duty, and their true Intereſt; and conſequently if the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Arguments of the Chriſtian Religion have not a conſtant and certain
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58790:60"/>
Effect upon a great part of Mankind. Not but that Chriſtianity is apt to bring Men to Goodneſs; but ſome are ſo obſtinately bad, as not to be wrought upon by the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſiderations it can offer to them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It cannot be denied, but that Chriſtianity is as well framed to make Men good, as any Religion can be imagined to be; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wherever the Fault be, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in the Chriſtian Religion, that we are not good. So that the bad Lives of Chriſtians are no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Objection either againſt the Truth or Goodneſs of the Chriſtian Doctrine. Beſides the Confirmation that was given to it by Miracles, the Excellency of the Doctrine, and its proper Tendency to make Men holy and virtuous, are a plain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its Divine and Heavenly Original. And ſurely the Goodneſs of any Religion conſiſts in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of its Precepts, to direct Men to their Duty; in the force of its Arguments to perſuade Men to it; and the ſuitableneſs of its Aids and Helps to enable us to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58790:61"/>
and Performance of it. And all thoſe Advantages the Chriſtian Religion hath above any Religion or Inſtitution that ever was in the World. The reaſonable and plain Rules of a good Life are no where ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly collected, as in the Diſcourſes of our Bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles. No Religion ever gave Men ſo full Aſſurance of the mighty Rewards and Puniſhments of another World; nor ſuch gracious Promiſes of Divine Aſſiſtance, and ſuch Evidence of it, eſpecially in the Piety, and Virtue, and Patience, and Self-denial of the Primitive Chriſtians, as the Doctrine of God our Saviour hath done, <hi>which teacheth Men to deny <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and worldly Luſts, and to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World, in contemplation of the bleſſed hope and the glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. and <hi>laſtly,</hi> After all that hath or can be ſaid, it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and ought ſadly to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58790:61"/>
by us, that the wicked Lives of Chriſtians are a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Scandal and Reproach to our Holy Religion, and a great Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to the ſpreading of it in the World, and a real Objection againſt it to prejudiced Perſons, with whom it doth juſtly bring into doubt the Goodneſs and Efficacy of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution it ſelf, to ſee how little Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it hath upon the Hearts and Lives of Men. It is hard for a Man to maintain the Reputation of an excellent Maſter in any kind, when all the World ſees, that moſt of his Scholars prove Dunces. Whatever Commendation may be given to any Art or Science, Men will queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Truth and Reality of it, when they ſee the greateſt part of thoſe who profeſs it, not able to do any thing anſwerable to it. The Chriſtian Religion pretends to be an Art of ſerving God more decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and devoutly, and of living bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than other Men: but if it be ſo, why do not the Profeſſors of this excellent Religion ſhew the Force and Virtue of it in their Lives? And though I have ſufficiently ſhewn,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58790:62"/>
that this is not enough to overthrow the Truth, and diſparage the Excellency of the Chriſtian Doctrine; yet it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly go a great way with prejudiced Perſons, and it cannot be expected otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>So that we have infinite Reaſon to be aſhamed, that there is ſo plain a contrariety between the Laws of Chriſtianity, and the Lives of the greateſt part of Chriſtians; ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and palpable a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Religion that is in the Bible, and that which is to be ſeen and read in the Converſations of Men.</p>
            <p>Who that looks upon the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the preſent Age, could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if he did not know it, that the holy and pure Doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion, had ever been ſo much as heard, much leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be entertained and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among us? Nay among thoſe who ſeem to make a more ſerious Profeſſion of Religion, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how ſtrangely they allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Malice and Envy, in Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Anger, and Uncharitable Cenſures, and evil Speaking, in fierce
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58790:62"/>
Contentions and Animoſities; who would believe that the great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Mens Religion, I mean the Holy Bible, by which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to regulate and govern their Lives, were full of plain and ſtrict Precepts of Love and Kindneſs, of Charity and Peace, and did a hundred times with all imaginable Severity, and under pain of forfeiting the Kingdom of God, forbid Malice and Envy, and Revenge, and evil ſpeaking, and raſh and uncharitable Cenſures, and tell us ſo plainly that the Chriſtian Religion obligeth Men <hi>to put off all theſe</hi>; and that <hi>if any Man ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, that Man's Religion is vain</hi>? Do men read and hear theſe Things every day, and profeſs to believe them to be the Truths of God, and yet live as if they were verily perſuaded they were falſe? What can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from hence, but either that this is not Chriſtianity, or the greateſt part of us are no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</p>
            <p>So that if one of the Apoſtles or Primitive Chriſtians ſhould riſe from
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58790:63"/>
the Dead, and converſe among us, how would he wonder to ſee the Face and Complexion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alter'd from what it was in their Days; and were it not for the Name and Title which we bear, would ſooner gueſs us to be any thing than Chriſtians?</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole Matter, there is no Way to quit our ſelves of this Objection, and to waſh away the Reproach of it, but to mend and reform our Lives. 'Till this be done, it is unavoidable, but the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Manners of Men will affect our Religion with Obloquy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and derive an ill Conceit and Opinion of it into the Minds of Men. And I cannot ſee how Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity can ever gain much ground in the World, 'till it be better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned and recommended by the Profeſſors of it. Nay we have juſt cauſe to fear, that if God do not raiſe up ſome great and eminent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to awaken the World out of this ſtupid Lethargy, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity will every Day decline, and the World will in a ſhort Space be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58790:63"/>
over-run with Atheiſm and Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For Vice, and Superſtition, and Enthuſiaſm, which are the reigning Diſeaſes of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> when they have run their Courſe, and finiſh'd their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, do all naturally end, and meet in Atheiſm. And then it will be time for the great Judge of the World to appear, and effectually to convince Men of that, which they would not be perſuaded to believe by any other Means. And of this our Saviour hath given us a terrible and fearful Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that Queſtion of his; <hi>When the Son of Man comes, ſhall be find Faith upon Earth?</hi> Our Saviour hath not poſitively affirmed it, and God grant that we may not make it, and find it true.</p>
            <p>And thus I have, by God's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, given the beſt Satisfaction I could, to the moſt material Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions I have met with againſt our bleſſed Saviour and his Religion. The</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thing remains briefly to be ſpoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> How happy a Thing it is to eſcape the common Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58790:64"/>
which Men are apt to entertain againſt Religion, <hi>Bleſſed is he, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall not be offended in me.</hi> And this will appear if we conſider theſe <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Prejudice does many times ſway and biaſs Men againſt the plaineſt and cleareſt Truths. We ſee in daily Experience, what a falſe Biaſs Prejudice puts upon Mens Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. Men that are educated in the groſſeſt Errors and Superſtitions, how hard it is to convince them that they are in a wrong Way! and with what Difficulty are they perſuaded of their Miſtake! Nay they have hardly the Patience to be told they are in an Error, much leſs to conſider what may be offer'd againſt it. How do the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Luſts of Men blind them and lead them aſide from the Truth, and incline them to that ſide of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which is moſt favourable to their Luſts and Intereſts? How partially do Men lean to that part which makes moſt for their Advantage, though all the Reaſon in the World lye on the other ſide?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:58790:64"/>Now Ignorance and Miſtake are a great Slavery of the Underſtanding, if there were no worſe Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Errors: and therefore our Saviour ſays excellently, that the Truth makes Men free; <hi>Ye ſhall know the Truth, and the Truth ſhall make you free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Prejudice does not only biaſs Men againſt the plaineſt Truths, but in Matters of greateſt Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in things that concern the Honour of God, and the Good of others, and our own Welfare and Happineſs. Prejudices againſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion occaſion Miſtakes of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Nature, and may lead Men to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Idolatry, and to all manner of Impiety, nay many times to Atheiſm and Infidelity. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt the Doctrine of our Saviour are of another Concernment than the Prejudices which Men have againſt the Writers of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy or Eloquence, or any other Human Art or Science. If a Man's Prejudice make him err in theſe Matters, the Thing is of no great Moment: but the buſineſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58790:65"/>
is a matter of the greateſt and weightieſt Concernment to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Conſequence of Mens Prejudices in theſe things prove ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times fatal and deſtructive to them. Men may upon unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prejudices <hi>reject the Counſel of God againſt themſelves</hi>; as it is ſaid of the <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Men may oppoſe the Truth ſo obſtinately and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to be <hi>Fighters againſt God,</hi> and to bring certain Ruin and <hi>ſwift De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon themſelves,</hi> both in this World, and the other; as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, who by oppoſing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, and perſecuting our Saviour and his Diſciples, <hi>fill'd up the meaſure of their Sins, 'till Wrath came upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi> It is eaſy to entertain Prejudices againſt Religion, and by conſidering only the wrong ſide of things, to fortify our Prejudices to ſuch a Degree, and entrench our ſelves ſo ſtrongly in our Errors, that the plaineſt and moſt convincing Truths ſhall not be able to have any Acceſs to us, or make any Impreſſion upon us: but all this
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58790:65"/>
while we do in truth undermine our own Happineſs, and are ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly working our own Ruin; and while we think we are oppoſing an Enemy, we are deſtroying our ſelves; <hi>for who hath harden'd himſelf againſt God</hi> and his Truth, <hi>and proſpered?</hi> The Principles of Religion are a firm and immoveable Rock, againſt which the more violently we daſh our ſelves, the more miſerably we ſhall be ſplit and ſhatter'd. Our Bleſſed Saviour and his Religion, have been to many, and are to this day <hi>a Stone of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and a Rock of Offence</hi>; but he himſelf hath told us what ſhall be the Fate of thoſe who are offended at him; <hi>Whoſoever ſhall fall on this Stone, ſhall be broken; but upon whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it ſhall fall, it ſhall grind him to Powder.</hi> And therefore well might he ſay here in the Text, <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſoever ſhall not be offended in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There are but few in compariſon, who have the Happineſs to eſcape and overcome the common Prejudices which Men are apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain againſt Religion. Thus to be ſure it was when Chriſtianity firſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58790:66"/>
appeared in the World: And though among us the great Prejudice of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation be removed; yet there are ſtill many, who upon one Account or other, are prejudiced againſt Religion, at leaſt ſo far, as not to yield to the Power of it in their Lives. Few Men are ſo impartial in conſidering things, as not to be ſwayed by the Intereſt of their Luſts and Paſſions, as to keep the Balance of their Judgments even, and to ſuffer nothing but Truth and Reaſon to weigh with them. We generally pretend to be <hi>Pilgrims and Strangers in the World,</hi> and to be all travelling towards Heaven: but few of us have the Indifferency of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers; who are not concern'd to find out the faireſt and the eaſieſt Way, but to know which is the right Way, and to go in it. Thus it ſhould be with us, our End ſhould always be in our Eye, and we ſhould chuſe our way only with Reſpect to that; not conſidering our Inclination ſo much as our Deſign; nor chuſing thoſe Principles for the Government of our Lives, which are moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our preſent Deſires, but thoſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58790:66"/>
which will moſt certainly bring us to Happineſs at the laſt; and that I am ſure the Principles of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, firmly believed and practiſed by us, will do.</p>
            <p>Let us then be perſuaded by all that hath been ſaid upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to a firm Belief of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine. I hope you are in ſome Meaſure ſatisfied, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt it are not ſuch, as ought much to move a wiſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Man. If we believe that God hath taken ſo much care of Mankind, as to make any certain Revelation of his Will to them, and of the way to Eternal Happineſs; let us next conſider, whether any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the World can come in Competition with the Chriſtian, and with half that Reaſon pretend to be from God, that Chriſtianity is able to produce for it ſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the Things to be believed, or the Duties to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, or the Motives and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Practice of thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or the Divine Confirmation that is given to the whole. And
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58790:67"/>
if we be thus perſuaded concerning it, let us reſolve to live up to the Laws and Rules of this Holy Religion. Our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it ſignifies nothing, without the Fruits and Effects of a Good Life. And if this were once reſolved upon, the Difficulty of believing would ceaſe; for the true Reaſon why Men are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe the Truths of the Goſpel, is becauſe they are loth to put them in Practice. <hi>Every one that doth Evil, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Light.</hi> The true Ground of moſt Mens Prejudice againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine, is becauſe they have no mind to obey it; and when all is done, the great Objection that lies at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Mens Minds againſt it, is, that it is an Enemy to their Luſts, and they cannot profeſs to believe it without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning themſelves, for not complying with it in their Lives and Practice.</p>

            <p>ST. <hi>Paul</hi> in the beginning of this Epiſtle (according to his Cuſtom in the reſt) ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Apoſtle, particularly call'd, and ſet apart by God, for the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel; the main Subject whereof was, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord</hi>; Who as he was, according to his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58790:68"/>
Divine Nature,<note place="margin">Vol. V.</note> 
               <hi>the eternal Son of God</hi>; ſo according to his Human Nature, he was not only <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> but alſo <hi>the Son of God. According to the Fleſh</hi> (that is, the Weakneſs, and Frailty, and Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Human Nature) <hi>he was the Son of David,</hi> that is, of his Poſterity by his Mother, who was of that Houſe and Line. <hi>Made of the ſeed of David, according to the Fleſh,</hi> v. 3. <hi>But according to the Spirit of Holineſs</hi>; (that is, in regard of that Divine Power of the Holy Ghoſt, which was manifeſted in him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his Reſurrection from the Dead) <hi>he was demonſtrated to be the Son of God</hi>; even according to his Human Nature; <hi>Declared to be the Son of God, with Power, according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Holineſs, by the Reſurrection from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Difficulty in the Words, is concerning the meaning of this Phraſe; of Chriſt's being <hi>declared to be the Son of God</hi>: The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which moſt frequently in Scripture does ſignify <hi>predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, decreed, determined</hi>; but it likewiſe ſignifies, that which is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58790:68"/>
declared, demonſtrated,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ser. 4.</note> 
               <hi>put out of all Doubt and Controverſy.</hi> And in this Senſe our Tranſlation renders it. As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, though according to the Frailty and Weakneſs of his Human Nature, he was of the Seed of <hi>David</hi>; yet in reſpect of that Divine Power of the Holy Ghoſt, which manifeſted it ſelf in him, eſpecially in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the Dead, he was <hi>declared to be the Son of God, with Power,</hi> that is, mightily, powerfully demonſtrated to be ſo; ſo as to put the matter out of all Diſpute and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy.</p>
            <p>And therefore following our own Tranſlation, I ſhall handle the Words in this Senſe, as containing this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in them: <hi>That the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead, by the Holy Ghoſt, is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful demonſtration that he was the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it will conduce very much to the clearing of this Propoſition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe <hi>Two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:58790:69"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Upon what Account Chriſt, as Man, is ſaid to be <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In what Senſe he is ſaid to be <hi>declared to be the Son of God, by his Reſurrection from the Dead.</hi> The Conſideration of theſe <hi>Two</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars will fully clear this Propoſition, and the Apoſtles Meaning in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Upon what Account Chriſt, as Man, is ſaid to be <hi>the Son of God.</hi> And for our right Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Matter, it is very well worthy our Obſervation, that Chriſt, as Man, is no where in Scripture ſaid to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> but with relation to the Divine Power of the Holy Ghoſt, ſome way or other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently manifeſted in him; I ſay the Divine Power of the Holy Ghoſt, as the Lord and Giver of Life, as he is call'd in the Ancient Creeds of the Chriſtian Church. For as Men are naturally ſaid to be the Children of thoſe from whom they receive their Life and Being; ſo Chriſt, as Man, is ſaid to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> becauſe he had Life communicated to him, from the Father, by an immediate
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58790:69"/>
Power of the Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghoſt. Firſt at his Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was by the Holy Ghoſt. The Conception of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was an immediate Act of the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing, as the Scripture expreſſeth it, the bleſſed Mother of our Lord: And then at his Reſurrection, when after his Death, he was, by the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt, raiſed to Life again.</p>
            <p>Now upon theſe two Accounts only, Chriſt as Man, is ſaid in Scripture to be <hi>the Son of God.</hi> He was really ſo upon Account of his Conception; but this was ſecret and inviſible: but moſt eminently and remarkably ſo, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Reſurrection, which was open and viſible to all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Upon Account of his Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt. That upon this Account he was called <hi>the Son of God,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> moſt expreſly tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. where the Angel tells the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt ſhould come upon her, and the Power of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhould overſhadow her, and therefore
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58790:70"/>
that Holy Thing, which ſhould be born of her, ſhould be call'd the Son of God.</hi> And this our Saviour means <hi>by the Father's ſanctifying him, and ſending him into the World</hi>; For which Reaſon he ſays he might juſtly call himſelf <hi>the Son of God,</hi> John 10.35, 36. <hi>If he call them Gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be broken: Say ye of him, whom the Father hath ſanctified, and ſent into the World, Thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid I am the Son of God?</hi> If there had been no other Reaſon, this had been ſufficient to have given him the Title of <hi>the Son of God,</hi> that he was brought into the World by the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or Divine Power of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt is alſo ſaid in Scripture to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and to be <hi>declared</hi> to be ſo upon Account of <hi>his Reſurrection from the Dead,</hi> by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt. His Reſurrection from the Dead, is here in the Text aſcribed to <hi>the Spirit of Holineſs,</hi> or the Holy Ghoſt. And ſo in other places of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the Dead, dwell in you:</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:58790:70"/>
And, 1 Pet. 3.18. <hi>Being put to Death in the Fleſh: but quickned by the Spirit</hi>; that is, he ſuffer'd in that frail mortal Nature which he aſſumed; but was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, of the Spirit of God which reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in him. And upon this Account he is expreſly ſaid in Scripture to be <hi>the Son of God.</hi> Pſal. 2.7. <hi>I will declare the decree; The Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee</hi>; to which perhaps the Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes here in the Text, when he ſays that <hi>Chriſt was decreed to be the Son of God, by his Reſurrection from the Dead.</hi> To be ſure theſe Words, <hi>This day have I begotten thee,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly tells us were accompliſh'd in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt; as if God by raiſing him from the Dead, had <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten</hi> him, and <hi>decreed</hi> him to be <hi>his Son. Acts</hi> 13.32, 33. <hi>And we declare unto you glad Tidings, how that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which was made unto the Fathers, God hath fulfilled the ſame unto their Children, in that he hath raiſed up Jeſus again, as it is alſo written in the ſecond Pſalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:58790:71"/>He was <hi>the Son of God</hi> before, as he was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt; but this was ſecret and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and known only to the Mother of our Lord: And therefore God thought fit to give a publick and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonſtration of it, ſo as to put the matter out of all queſtion, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him in a powerful manner to be his Son, by giving him a new Life after Death, by raiſing him from the Dead; and by this new and eminent Teſtimony given to him, declared him again to be his Son, and confirmed the Title which was given him before upon a true, but more ſecret Account, of his being conceived by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And as our Saviour is ſaid to be <hi>the Son of God</hi> upon this twofold Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, of his Conception by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and his Reſurrection to Life by the Spirit of God: So the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (which does ſolicitouſly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue a Reſemblance and Conformity between Chriſt and Chriſtians) does likewiſe upon a twofold Account (anſwerable to our Saviour's Birth and Reſurrection) call true Believers and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58790:71"/>
Chriſtians, <hi>the Children of God; viz.</hi> Upon Account of their Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or new Birth, by the Operation of the Spirit of God; and upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Reſurrection to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, by the Power of the ſame Spirit.</p>
            <p>Upon account of our Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and becoming Chriſtians by the Power and Operation of the Holy Spirit of God upon our Minds, we are ſaid to be the Children of God, as being regenerated and born again by the Holy Spirit of God. And this is our firſt Adoption. And for this Reaſon, the Spirit of God conferred upon Chriſtians at their Baptiſm, and dwelling and reſiding in them afterwards, is call'd <hi>the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption</hi>; Rom. 8.15. <hi>Ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Spirit of Adoption, whereby you cry, Abba Father</hi>; And <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5, 6. Believers are ſaid <hi>to receive the Adoption of Sons; God having ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into their Hearts, crying Abba Father</hi>; That is, all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, for as much as they are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the Holy Spirit of God, and have the Spirit of God dwelling in them, may with Confidence call
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58790:72"/>
God Father, and look upon themſelves as his Children. So the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14 <hi>That as many as are led (or acted) by the Spirit of God, are the ſons of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though we are ſaid to be Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God upon account of our Regeneration, and the Holy Spirit of God dwelling and reſiding in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; yet we are eminently ſo, upon account of our Reſurrection to Eternal Life, by the mighty Power of God's Spirit. This is our final Adoption, and the Conſummation of it; and therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. this is called <hi>the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> becauſe by this we are for ever <hi>deliver'd from the Bondage of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; and by way of Eminency, <hi>the Adoption,</hi> viz. <hi>the Redemption of our Bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are indeed <hi>the Sons of God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon account of the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſanctifying Virtue of the Holy Ghoſt; but finally and chiefly upon account of our Reſurrection by the power of the Divine Spirit. So St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that then we ſhall be declared to be <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> after another manner than we are now:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58790:72"/>
1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God. Now we are the Sons of God,</hi> (that is, our Adoption is begun in our Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Sanctification) <hi>but it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be</hi>; we ſhall be much more eminently ſo at the Reſurrection. <hi>We know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the moſt expreſs and remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Text to this Purpoſe, is, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.36. where good Men, after the Reſurrection, are for this Reaſon ſaid to be <hi>the Children of God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>the Children of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. But they who ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to obtain that World, and the Reſurrection from the Dead, neither marry, nor are given in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, neither can they die any more; for they are equal to the Angels, and are the Children of God, being the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Reſurrection.</hi> For this Reaſon they are ſaid to be <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> becauſe they are raiſed by him to a new Life; and to be made Partakers of that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them, and reſerved for them. For all that are raiſed by the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58790:73"/>
Power of God, out of the Duſt of the Earth, are not therefore <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God</hi>; but only they that have part in the bleſſed Reſurrection to Eternal Life, and <hi>do inherit the Kingdom prepared for them.</hi> Not thoſe who are raiſed to a perpetual Death, and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Condemnation.</hi> Theſe are not <hi>the Children of God</hi>; but <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath,</hi> and <hi>the Children of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Reſurrection of the Juſt, is the full and final Declaration, that we are <hi>the Children of God</hi>; not only becauſe we are reſtored to a new Life, but becauſe at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, we are admitted to the full Poſſeſſion of that bleſſed Inheritance which is purchaſed for us, and promiſed to us.</p>
            <p>And the Spirit of God which is conferred upon Believers in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and afterwards dwells and reſides in them, is the Pledge and earneſt of our final Adoption, by our Reſurrection to Eternal Life; and upon this account, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is ſaid to be the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of our future Inheritance, and the <hi>Seal</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:58790:73"/>
and Confirmation of it. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom alſo, after that ye believed, ye were ſealed by that Holy Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is the earneſt of our Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, until the redemption of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Poſſeſſion</hi>; that is, the Holy Spirit of God which Chriſtians were made Partakers of, upon their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Belief of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the Seal and Earneſt of our Reſurrection to Eternal Life; as the Apoſtle plainly tells us, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Text; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your mortal Bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been the longer upon this, becauſe it ſerves fully to explain to us thoſe obſcure Phraſes, of the <hi>Seal,</hi> and <hi>Earneſt,</hi> and <hi>firſt Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> which many have miſtaken to import ſome particular and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Revelation or Impreſſion upon the Minds of good Men, aſſuring them of their Salvation. Whereas the Apoſtle intended no more by them, but that the Spirit of God which dwells in Believers, enabling them <hi>to mortifie
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58790:74"/>
the deeds of the Fleſh, and to bring forth the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> is a Pledge and Earneſt to us, of a bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to eternal Life by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Spirit of God which now dwells in us, and is the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which raiſed up Jeſus from the dead. And in this Chapter, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>To bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our Spirits,</hi> that is, to aſſure our Minds, <hi>that we are the Children of God</hi>; that is, that we are his Children now, and conſequently Heirs of a glorious Reſurrection to Eternal Life: For ſo it follows in the next Words, <hi>and if Children, then Heirs, Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt; if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified together.</hi> And this being glorified together with Chriſt at the Reſurrection, he calls, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>the manifeſtation of the Sons of God.</hi> Thus you ſee how in Conformity to <hi>the Son of God,</hi> our elder Brother, we are ſaid to be <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> becauſe we are now regenerated, and ſhall at the laſt day be raiſed up to Eternal Life, by the Power of the Spirit of God. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:58790:74"/>
               <hi>Second</hi> Thing I propounded to ſpeak to, for the clearing of theſe words, namely, in what Senſe Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>declared,</hi> or <hi>Demonſtrated to be the Son of God by his Reſurrection from the dead.</hi> By which the Apoſtle means theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That by his Reſurrection from the dead he was approved by God to be the true Meſſias, and vindicated to the World from all Suſpicion of being a Deceiver and Impoſtor. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the</p>
            <p n="2">2. Place, That hereby God gave Teſtimony to the Truth and Divinity of his Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By his Reſurrection from the dead, he was approved by God to be the True Meſſias, foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and expected at that time by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſufficiently vindicated to the World to be no Deceiver and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.</p>
            <p>And for our fuller Underſtanding of this, we are to conſider theſe <hi>two</hi> Things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) What the Apprehenſions and Expectations of the <hi>Jews</hi> were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſias. And,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:58790:75"/>(2.) What the many Crimes were which they laid to our Saviour's charge, and for which they condemned him.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) What the Apprehenſions and Expectations of the <hi>Jews</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meſſias. And it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain from the Evangelical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that they generally apprehended theſe two things of him: That the Meſſias was to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and <hi>the King of Iſrael</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that our Saviour, by affirming himſelf to be the Meſſias, did call himſelf <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and <hi>the King of Iſrael; John</hi> 1.41. <hi>Andrew</hi> tells his Brother <hi>Simon, We have found the Meſſias.</hi> V. 45. <hi>Philip</hi> tells <hi>Nathanael, We have found him, of whom Moſes in the Law, and the Prophets did write</hi>; that is, the Meſſias. <hi>V.</hi> 49. <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nael</hi> upon Diſcourſe with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, being convinced that he was the Meſſias, owns him in theſe Terms; <hi>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Iſrael.</hi> John 6.69. <hi>Peter</hi> declares his Belief that he was the Chriſt, or the Meſſias, in theſe Words, <hi>We believe and are ſure that thou art the Son of the living
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58790:75"/>
God.</hi> This appears likewiſe from the High-Prieſt's Queſtion to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.63. <hi>Art thou the Chriſt,</hi> (that is, the Meſſias) <hi>the Son of the living God</hi>; or as it is in St. <hi>Mark, the Son of the Bleſſed;</hi> compared with <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews</hi>? And when he was upon the Croſs, ſome reviled him under the Notion of <hi>the Son of God,</hi> Matth. 27.40. <hi>If thou be the Son of God, come down from the Croſs</hi>: Others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of <hi>the King of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> v. 42. <hi>If he be the King of Iſrael, let him come down from the Croſs.</hi> From all which it is plain that the <hi>Jews</hi> expected and believed, that the true Meſſias was to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and <hi>the King of Iſrael;</hi> and whoever was not ſo, was a Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Impoſtor. But our Saviour affirmed himſelf to be true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, and <hi>the Son of God.</hi> Now God by raiſing him from the dead, did abundantly vindicate him to the World, from all ſuſpicion of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; and gave Teſtimony to him, that he was all that he ſaid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>viz. the true Meſſias,</hi> and <hi>the Son of God.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:58790:76"/>Which will further appear, if we conſider, (2<hi>dly,</hi>) What were the Crimes which the <hi>Jews</hi> laid to our Saviour's Charge, and for which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him; and they were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe two, That by giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out to be <hi>the Meſſias,</hi> he made himſelf <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>the Son of God.</hi> Of the firſt of theſe, they accuſed him to <hi>Pilate</hi>; hoping by this Accuſation to make him guilty of Sedition againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for ſaying, that he was <hi>the King of Iſrael.</hi> Of the other they accuſed him to the Chief Prieſts, as being guilty of Blaſphemy, in that not being <hi>the Meſſias,</hi> he call'd himſelf <hi>the Son of God.</hi> And upon this they laid the main ſtreſs, as being a thing that would condemn him by their Law. They charged him with this in his life-time, as appears by thoſe Words of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 10.36. <hi>Say ye of him whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſanctified, and ſent into the World, Thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid I am the Son of God?</hi> And when he was arraigned before the Chief Prieſts, they accuſed him of this, and he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58790:76"/>
owning this Charge, <hi>that he call'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Son of God,</hi> upon this they judge him guilty of Death. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.65, 66. <hi>Then the High-Prieſt rent his Cloaths, and ſaid, He hath ſpoken Blaſphemy; what further need have we of witneſs? Behold, now ye have heard his Blaſphemy. What think ye? They anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, He is guilty of Death.</hi> And when <hi>Pilate</hi> told them, that he found no Fault in him, they ſtill inſtance in this as his Crime, <hi>John</hi> 19.7. <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this being the Crime which was charged upon him, and for which he was crucified, and put to Death; God, by raiſing him up from the dead, and taking him up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, gave Teſtimony to him, that he was no Impoſtor, and that he did not vainly arrogate to himſelf to be the Meſſias and <hi>the Son of God.</hi> God by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him from the dead, by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, gave a mighty Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to him, that he was <hi>the Son of God.</hi> For which Reaſon he is ſaid by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. to be <hi>juſtified by the Spirit.</hi> The Spirit gave Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58790:77"/>
to him at his Baptiſm, and by the mighty Works that appeared in him in his Life-time; but he was moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and remarkably <hi>juſtified by the Holy Ghoſt, by his Reſurrection from the Dead</hi>; God hereby bearing him Witneſs, that he was unjuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and that he aſſumed nothing to himſelf, but what of right did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him, when he ſaid he was the Meſſias, and <hi>the Son of God.</hi> For how could a Man that was condemned to dye, for calling himſelf <hi>the Son of God,</hi> be more remarkably vindicated, and more clearly proved to be ſo, than by being raiſed from the dead, by the Power of God?</p>
            <p>And, 2<hi>dly,</hi> God did conſequently hereby give Teſtimony to the Truth and Divinity of our Saviour's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Being proved by his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> this proved him to be a Teacher ſent by him, and that what he declared to the World was the Mind and Will of God. For this none was more likely to know, and to report truly to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than <hi>the Son of God,</hi> who came from <hi>the Boſom of his Father.</hi> And becauſe the Reſurrection of Chriſt is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58790:77"/>
ſo great a Teſtimony to the Truth of his Doctrine, hence it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the belief of this one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Chriſt's Reſurrection, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to a Man's Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy Heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> The Reaſon is plain, becauſe the Reſurrection of Chriſt confirmed the Truth and Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Doctrine; ſo that the belief of our Saviour's Reſurrection does by neceſſary Conſequence infer the belief of his whole Doctrine. That God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead, after he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and put to Death for calling himſelf <hi>the Son of God,</hi> is a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he really was <hi>the Son of God</hi>; and if he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which he taught was true, and from God.</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſhewn you, how the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt from the dead, is a <hi>powerful Demonſtration</hi> that he was <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that remains, is briefly to draw ſome practical Inferences from the Conſideration of our Saviour's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:58790:78"/>1<hi>ſt.</hi> To confirm and eſtabliſh our Minds in the belief of the Chriſtian Religion, of which the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead is ſo great a Confirmation. And therefore I told you that this one Article is mentioned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> as the Sum and Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Chriſtian Faith; <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and believe in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> The belief of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Reſurrection doth by neceſſary conſequence infer the belief of his whole Doctrine; for he who believes that God raiſed him from the dead, after he was put to death for calling himſelf <hi>the Son of God,</hi> cannot but believe him to be <hi>the Son of God</hi>; and conſequently that the Doctrine which he delivered was from God.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> The Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead aſſures us of a future Judgment, and of the Recompences and Rewards of another World. That Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, is a demonſtration of another Life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this; and no man that believes the immortality of our Souls, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life after this, ever doubted
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58790:78"/>
of a future Judgment; ſo that by the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead, God hath given aſſurance unto all men of a future Judgment, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Recompences and Rewards of another World.</p>
            <p>The conſideration whereof ought to have a mighty influence upon us, more eſpecially to theſe three pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> To raiſe our minds above the preſent Enjoyments of this Life. Were but men convinced of this great and obvious Truth, that there is an infinite difference between Time and Eternity, between a few days and everlaſting Ages; would we but ſometimes repreſent to our ſelves, what thoughts and apprehenſions dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men have of this World, how vain and empty a thing it appears to them, how like a Pageant and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow it looks, as it paſſeth away from them; methinks none of theſe things could be a ſufficient temptation to any Man to forget God and his Soul; but notwithſtanding all the preſent delights and allurements of Senſe, we ſhould be ſtrongly intent upon the concernments of another World,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58790:79"/>
and almoſt wholly taken up with the thoughts of the vaſt Eternity which we are ready to enter into. For what is there in this World, this vaſt and howling Wilderneſs, this rude and barbarous Country which we are but to paſs through, which ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and entangle our Affections, and take off our Thoughts from our Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Habitation, from that <hi>better,</hi> and that <hi>heavenly Country,</hi> where we hope to live and to be happy for ever?</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> The Conſideration of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of another World ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport us under the troubles and afflictions of this World. The hopes of a bleſſed Reſurrection are a very proper Conſideration to bear us up under the evils and preſſures of this Life. If we hope for ſo great a Happineſs hereafter, we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to bear ſome Afflictions in this World; becauſe the Bleſſedneſs which we expect will ſo abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and outweigh our preſent Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. So the Apoſtle aſſures us, Rom. 8.18. <hi>We know that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58790:79"/>
that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof was that which made the Primitive Chriſtians to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in their Sufferings, and in the midſt of all their Tribulations <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the hopes of the Glory of God</hi>; becauſe their Sufferings did really prepare and make way for their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. So the ſame Apoſtle tells us, 2 Cor. 4.17, 18. <hi>Our light Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are but for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory; whilſt we look not at the things which are ſeen; for the things which are ſeen are Temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> and laſtly, The aſſurance of our future Reward is a mighty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Obedience and a Holy Life. What greater Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement can we have than this, That all the good which we do in this World will accompany us into the other? <hi>That when we reſt from our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, our works will follow us?</hi> That when we ſhall be ſtript of other things, and parted from them, theſe will ſtill remain with us, and bear us company? Our Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58790:80"/>
our ſenſual Pleaſures and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will all take their leave of us, when we leave this World; nay many times they do not accompany us ſo far as the Grave, but take occaſion to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake us, when we have the greateſt need and uſe of them: but Piety and Virtue are <hi>that better part which cannot be taken from us.</hi> All the good actions which we do in this world will go along with us into the other, and through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our Redeemer procure for us, at the hands of a Gracious and Merciful God, a Glorious and Eternal Reward; not according to the meanneſs of our Services, but according to the Bounty of his Mind, and the vaſtneſs of his Treaſures and Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Now what an encouragement is this to Holineſs and Obedience, to conſider that it will all be our own another day; to be aſſured that whoever ſerves God faithfully, and does ſuffer for him pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, does lay up ſo much Treaſure for himſelf in another World, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides laſting Comforts for himſelf, and faithful and conſtant Companions, that will never leave him nor forſake him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:58790:80"/>Let us then do all the good we can, while we have opportunity, and ſerve God with all our might, knowing that no good action that we do ſhall be loſt and fall to the ground, that every Grace and Virtue that we exerciſe in this life, and every degree of them, <hi>ſhall receive their full recompence at the Reſurrection of the Juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ſhould this inſpire us with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and Zeal and Induſtry in the Service of God, to have ſuch a Reward continually in our Eye? how ſhould it tempt us to our Duty, to have <hi>a Crown</hi> and <hi>a Kingdom</hi> offered to us, <hi>Joys un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of Glory, ſuch things as Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor have entred into the heart of man?</hi> And <hi>ſuch are the things which God hath laid up for them who love him heartily, and ſerve him faithfully in this World.</hi>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58790:82"/>
why the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did for a long time reject the Authority of this Book;<note place="margin">Vol. V.</note> which by the way I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take notice of as a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſtance both of the fallible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Church, and of the fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Oral Tradition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for St. <hi>Jerom</hi> more than once expreſly tells us, <hi>that in his time</hi> (which was about 400 years after Chriſt) <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>did not receive this Epiſtle for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:</hi> But it is plain, that ſince that time, whether moved by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the thing, or (which is more probable) by the Conſent and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of other Churches, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, and do at this day acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it for <hi>Canonical</hi>; from whence one of theſe two things will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow; either that they were in an error for 400 years together while they rejected it; or that they have ſince erred for a longer time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it. One of theſe is unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for if the Book be <hi>Canonical</hi> now, it was ſo from the beginning; for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf confeſſeth (and if he had not confeſſed it, it is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs true and certain) that the Church cannot make a Book <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:58790:82"/>
which was not ſo before;<note place="margin">Ser. 5.</note> if it was not <hi>Canonical</hi> at firſt, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made ſo afterward; ſo that let them chuſe which part they will, it is evident, beyond all denial, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath actually er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in her Judgment concerning the Authority of this Book; and one error of this kind is enough to deſtroy her Infallibility, there being no greater Evidence that a Church is not Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than if it plainly appear that ſhe hath been deceived.</p>
            <p>And this alſo is a convincing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Fallibility of Oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For if <hi>that</hi> be Infallible in delivering down to us the <hi>Canonical</hi> Books of Scripture, it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that whatever Books were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered down to us for <hi>Canonical</hi> in one Age, muſt have been ſo in all Ages; and whatever was rejected in any Age, muſt always have been reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but we plainly ſee the contrary, from the inſtance of this Epiſtle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which pretends to be the great and faithful Preſerver of Tradition) hath in ſeveral Ages deliver'd ſeveral things. This is a peremptory inſtance both of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58790:83"/>
the Fallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and of her Oral Tradition.</p>
            <p>Having obſerved this by the way, which I could not well paſs by upon ſo fair an occaſion, I ſhall betake my ſelf to the explication of theſe words; towards which it will be no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to conſider the particular Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Expreſſions in the Text. <hi>It is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>; that is, were ſolemnly admitted into the Church by Baptiſm, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the profeſſion of Chriſtianity. Nothing was more frequent among the Ancients, than to call Baptiſm, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Illumination</hi>; and thoſe who were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized were called, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Perſons,</hi> becauſe of that Divine Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination which was convey'd to the minds of Men by the knowledge of Chriſtianity, the Doctrine whereof they made Profeſſion of at their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. And therefore <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells us, <hi>that by calling upon God the Father, and the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the name of the Holy Ghoſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the enlightned Perſon is waſhed</hi>; and again more expreſly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>this Laver</hi> (ſpeaking of Baptiſm) <hi>is called
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58790:83"/>
Illumination.</hi> And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> gives us the Reaſon; becauſe by virtue of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm <hi>in expiatum pectus ac purum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuper ſe lumen infundit, Light is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed from above into the purified Soul.</hi> And that this Expreſſion is ſo to be underſtood here in the Text, as alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.32. the <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> give us good ground to believe; for they render the Text thus, <hi>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for thoſe who have been once bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and have taſted of the Heavenly Gift.</hi> And at the 10<hi>th.</hi> Chap. <hi>v.</hi> 32. which we tranſlate, <hi>But call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the former days, in which after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions</hi>; that is, call to mind the former days, in which after by Baptiſm ye had publickly embraced the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, ye were upon that account expoſed to many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sufferings and Perſecutions. So that I think there can be no great doubt, but, by <hi>thoſe that were once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,</hi> the Apoſtle means <hi>thoſe that were baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed then, <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightned, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; theſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58790:84"/>
two Expreſſions ſeem to denote the Spiritual Benefits and Graces of the Holy Ghoſt conferred upon Chriſtians by Baptiſm; particularly Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the proper work of the Holy Ghoſt, and Juſtification and Remiſſion of Sins. So we find Faith, whereby we are juſtified, called the Gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Faith is the gift of God</hi>; and our Juſtification is called a Gift, and a free Gift, five ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times in one Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>But not as the offence, ſo alſo is the free gift; for if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many</hi>; and what this free Gift is, he tells us in the next words, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification, or Remiſſion of Sins, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>And not as it was by one that ſinned, ſo is the gift; for the judgment was by one to Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but the free gift is of many offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces unto juſtification. For if by one man's offence, death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one, Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore as by the offence of one, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58790:84"/>
came upon all men to condemnation: even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life.</hi> So that by the <hi>Heavenly Gift,</hi> I underſtand remiſſion of Sins; and by being <hi>made partakers of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> the Sanctifying Power and Efficacy of God's Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And have taſted the good Word of God</hi>; that is, entertained the Goſpel, which is here called <hi>the good Word of God</hi>; by reaſon of the gracious promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, particularly the Promiſes of Eternal Life and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the powers of the World to come,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel Age; that is, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Powers of the Holy Ghoſt which were beſtowed upon Men, in order to the propagation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And that this is the true meaning of this Phraſe, will I think be very plain to any one who ſhall but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Texts for the proof of this, they are ſo many and ſo well known;) And then if we conſider farther, that the times of the Goſpel, the days of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> are frequently called by the Jews <hi>Seculum futurum, The Age to come.</hi> And indeed this is the very Phraſe uſed by the LXX concerning our Saviour, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. where he is called, according to our Tranſlation, <hi>The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Father,</hi> but according to that of the LXX <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>The Farher of the future Age.</hi> And this very Phraſe is uſed once more in this Epiſtle to the <hi>Heb. ch.</hi> 2.5. <hi>For unto the Angels hath he not put in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection the World to come, whereof we now ſpeak.</hi> He had ſaid before, <hi>that the Law was given by Angels,</hi> v. 2. <hi>If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt</hi>; but the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, which he calls <hi>The World to come,</hi> or the future Age, was not committed to them, this was adminiſtred by the <hi>Son of God; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Angels hath he not put into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection the World to come.</hi> And 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that this Phraſe is only uſed in this Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> very well underſtood the meaning of it, being that whereby
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58790:85"/>
they commonly expreſt the times of the Goſpel according to that ancient Tradition of the Houſe of <hi>Elias,</hi> which diſtributed the duration of the World into three <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or Ages; the Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, the Age under the Law, and the Age of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which they called the <hi>Seculum futurum,</hi> or <hi>the Age to come</hi>; and which is likewiſe in Scripture called, <hi>The laſt days,</hi> or <hi>times,</hi> and the <hi>concluſion of the Ages</hi>; Concerning which, it was particularly propheſied, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be poured forth upon Men in miraculous Gifts and Powers. And to this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> is cited by St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>This is that which was ſpoken by the Prophet</hi> Joel, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, (ſaith God) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fleſh; and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall propheſie,</hi> &amp;c. From all which it is very evident, that by <hi>taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the powers of the World to come,</hi> is meant being partakers of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which were poured forth in the Goſpel Age, by the <hi>Jews</hi> commonly called, <hi>The World to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If they ſhall fall away</hi>; that is, if
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58790:86"/>
after all this they ſhall apoſtatize from this Profeſſion, out of love to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World, or from the fear of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and Sufferings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is impoſſible to renew them again to Repentance</hi>; that is, it is a thing very difficult, hardly to be hoped for, that ſuch wilful and notorious Apoſtates ſhould be reſtored again by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we tranſlate <hi>Impoſſible,</hi> is not always to be taken in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, for that which abſolutely cannot be; but many times for that which is ſo very difficult that it ſeems next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility. So our Saviour, that which in one place he calls <hi>exceeding hard, viz. for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> he afterwards calls <hi>impoſſible with Men</hi>; and ſo here I underſtand the Apoſtle, that thoſe who apoſtatize from Chriſtianity, after Baptiſm and the benefits of it, <hi>'Tis exceeding hard to recover them again to Repentance:</hi> This Phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to renew them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to Repentance,</hi> ſome underſtand of reſtoring them again to the Peace and Communion of the Church, by a courſe of Penance, ſuch as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58790:86"/>
in the ancient Church to great Offenders; and then they underſtand by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not a <hi>Natural,</hi> but a <hi>Moral Impoſſibility</hi>; that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done according to the Orders and Conſtitutions of the Church; that is, the Church did refuſe to admit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates, and ſome other great Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as Murderers and Adulterers, to a courſe of Penance, in order to their Reconciliation with the Church; This <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us was the ſtrictneſs of the Church in his time, <hi>Neque Idololatriae, neque Sanguini pax ab Eccleſiâ redditur</hi>; they admitted neither Idolaters, nor Murderers to the reconciliation of the Church. Though they were never ſo penitent, and ſhed never ſo many tears, yet he ſays they were <hi>jejunae pacis lacrimae,</hi> their tears were in vain, to reconcile them to the Peace and Communion of the Church. He ſays indeed, they did not abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their caſe deſperate in reſpect of God's Pardon and Forgiveneſs; <hi>ſed de veniâ Deo reſervamus,</hi> for that they referr'd them to God: but they were never to be admitted again into the Church; ſo ſtrict were many Churches, and that upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58790:87"/>
of this Text; though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was more moderate in this matter, and for that Reaſon call'd the Authority of this Book into queſtion.</p>
            <p>But I ſee no reaſon why theſe Words ſhould primarily be underſtood of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring Men to the Communion of the Church by Penance: but they ſeem to be meant of reſtoring Men to the Favour of God by Repentance; of which indeed their being reſtored to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church was a good ſign. This the Apoſtle ſays was <hi>very difficult,</hi> for thoſe who after Baptiſm, and the ſeveral benefits of it, did apoſtatize from Chriſtianity, <hi>to be recover'd again to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing they crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame.</hi> This is ſpoken by way of Aggravation of the crime of Apoſtacy, that they who fall off from Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in effect and by interpretation do <hi>crucifie the Son of God</hi> over again, and expoſe him to ſhame and reproach, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did; for by denying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of him, they declare him to be an Impoſtor, and conſequently worthy of that death which he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that Ignominy which he was
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58790:87"/>
expoſed to; and therefore, in account of God, they are ſaid to do that, which by their actions they do approve; ſo that it is made a Crime of the higheſt Nature, as if they ſhould <hi>crucifie the Son of God,</hi> and uſe him in the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious manner, even <hi>tread under foot the Son of God,</hi> as the expreſſion is to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Ch.</hi> 10.29.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavour'd, as briefly and clearly as I could, to explain to you the true meaning and importance of the ſeveral Phraſes and Expreſſions in the Text; the ſenſe whereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this, That if thoſe who are baptized, and by Baptiſm have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Remiſſion of Sins, and do believe the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the Promiſes of it, and are endow'd with the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, if ſuch perſons as theſe ſhall after all this apoſtatize from Chriſtianity, it is very hard, and next to an impoſſibility, to imagine how ſuch Perſons ſhould recover again by Repentance, ſeeing they are guilty of as great a Crime, as if in their own Perſons they had put to Death and ignominouſly uſed <hi>the Son of God</hi>; becauſe by rejecting of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58790:88"/>
him, they declare to the World that he ſuffered deſervedly.</p>
            <p>Having thus explained the words, in order to the further vindication of them, from the miſtakes and miſapprehenſions which have been about them, I ſhall endeavour to make out theſe <hi>five</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> That the Sin here mention'd is not <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That the Apoſtle does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to be abſolutely impoſſible, but only that thoſe who are guilty of it are recover'd to Repentance with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> That it is not a partial Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Religion by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular vicious Practice.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> That it is a total Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Religion, and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the Heathen Idolatry, which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> The Reaſon of the difficulty of the recovery of thoſe who fall into this Sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> That the Sin here mention'd is not <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which I have heretofore diſcourſed of, and ſhewn wherein the particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it does conſiſt. There are three
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58790:88"/>
things which do remarkably diſtinguſh the Sin here ſpoken of in the Text, from <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by our Saviour.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> The Perſons that are guilty of this Sin here in the Text, are evidently ſuch as had embraced Chriſtianity, and had taken upon them the Profeſſion of it: whereas thoſe whom our Saviour chargeth with <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are ſuch as conſtantly oppoſed his Doctrine, and reſiſted the Evidence he offer'd for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The particular nature of <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi> conſiſted in blaſpheming the Spirit, whereby our Saviour wrought his Miracles, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he did not do thoſe things by the Spirit of God, but by the aſſiſtance of the Devil; in that malicious and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable imputing of the plain Effects of the Holy Ghoſt to the Power of the Devil, and conſequently in an obſtinate refuſal to be convinced by the Miracles that he wrought: but here is nothing of all this ſo much as intimated by the Apoſtle in this place.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly, The Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi> is declared to be abſolutely <hi>unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, both in this World, and in that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58790:89"/>
which is to come.</hi> But this is not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be abſolutely unpardonable; which brings me to the</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d,</hi> Thing, namely, That this Sin here ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, is not ſaid to be abſolutely unpardonable. It is not <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; and whatever elſe it be, it is not out of the compaſs of God's Pardon and Forgiveneſs. So our Saviour hath told us, <hi>that all manner of Sin whatſoever that men have committed is capable of pardon, excepting only the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And though the Apoſtle here uſes a very ſevere Expreſſion, that <hi>if ſuch perſons fall away, it is impoſſible to renew them again to Repentance</hi>; yet I have ſhewn that there is no neceſſity of underſtanding this Phraſe in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word <hi>impoſſible</hi>; but as it is elſewhere uſed, for that which is <hi>extreamly difficult.</hi> Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed will our Saviour's Dclaration, which I mention'd before, that all Sins whatſoever are pardonable, except <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſuffer us to underſtand theſe words in the moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Senſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The Sin here ſpoken of, is not a partial Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58790:89"/>
Religion by any particular vicious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. Whoſoever lives in the habitual practice of any Sin plainly forbidden by the Chriſtian Law, may be ſaid ſo far to have apoſtatized from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: but this is not the <hi>falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of. This may be bad enough, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sins any Man who profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Chriſtian lives in, the more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly he contradicts his Profeſſion, and falls off from Chriſtianity, and the nearer he approacheth to the Sin in the Text, and the danger there threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but yet for all that, this is not that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> But it is a total Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Religion, more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the Heathen Idolatry, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the true God, and our Saviour, and the Worſhip of falſe Gods, which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of. And this will be evident, if we conſider the occaſion and main ſcope of this Epiſtle. And that was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had newly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſtianity, in the profeſſion of that Religion; and to keep them from apoſtatizing from it, becauſe of the Perſecutions and Sufferings which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58790:90"/>
that Profeſſion. It pleaſed God, when Chriſtianity firſt appeared in the World, to permit the Powers of the World to raiſe a vehement Perſecution againſt the Profeſſors of it, by reaſon whereof many out of baſe fear did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatize from it, and in teſtimony of their renouncing it, were forced to Sacrifice to the Heathen Idols. This is that which the Apoſtle endeavours to caution and arm Men againſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Epiſtle. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould fall away</hi>: And, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. it is call'd <hi>an evil heart of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief to apoſtatize from the living God. Take heed, Brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief to depart from the living God</hi>; that is, to fall from the Worſhip of the true God to Idolatry. And, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Let us hold faſt the Profeſſion of our Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wavering, not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together</hi>; that is, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, for fear of Perſecution; and, <hi>v.</hi> 26. it is call'd a <hi>ſinning wilfully, after we have received the knowledge of the Truth</hi>; and, <hi>v.</hi> 39. <hi>a drawing back to Perdition.</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:58790:90"/>
And, <hi>Ch.</hi> 12. it is call'd by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, <hi>the Sin which ſo eaſily beſets</hi>; the Sin, which in thoſe times of Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were ſo liable to.</p>
            <p>And I doubt not but this is the Sin which St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, and calls <hi>the Sin unto Death,</hi> and does not require Chriſtians <hi>to pray for thoſe who fall into it,</hi> with any aſſurance that it ſhall be forgiven; 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. <hi>There is a Sin unto Death; I do not ſay that he ſhall pray for it. All <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs is Sin, and there is a Sin not unto Death. We know that whoſoever is born of God, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not</hi>; that is, does not fall into the Sin of Apoſtacy from Chriſtianity to that of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Idolatry: <hi>But he that is begotten of God, keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</hi> And then, <hi>v.</hi> 21. he adds this Caution, <hi>Little children keep your ſelves from Idols.</hi> Which ſufficiently ſhews, what that Sin was which he was ſpeaking of before.</p>
            <p>So that this being the Sin which the Apoſtle deſign'd to caution Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt throughout this Epiſtle, it is very evident what <hi>falling away</hi> it is he here ſpeaks of, namely, a total A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy from Chriſtianity, and more eſpecially to the Heathen Idolatry.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:58790:91"/>5<hi>thly,</hi> We will conſider the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the difficulty of Recovering ſuch Perſons by Repentance. <hi>If they fall away, it is extremely difficult to renew them again to Repentance</hi>; and that for theſe <hi>three</hi> Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe of the greatneſs and hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of the Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe it renounceth, and caſteth off the means of Recovery.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe it is ſo high a Provocation of God to withdraw his Grace from ſuch Perſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe of the greatneſs and heinouſneſs of the Sin, both in the Nature and Circumſtances of it. It is a downright Apoſtacy from God, a direct renouncing of him, and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of his Truth, after Men have owned it, and been inwardly perſwaded and convinced of it; and ſo the Apoſtle expreſſeth it in this Epiſtle, calling it an <hi>Apoſtacy from the living God, a ſinning wilfully after we have received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth.</hi> It hath all the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations that a Crime is capable of, being againſt the cleareſt Light and Knowledge, and the fulleſt Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Man's Mind, concerning the Truth and goodneſs of that Religion
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58790:91"/>
which he renounceth; againſt the greateſt Obligations laid upon him by the Grace and Mercy of the Goſpel; after the free Pardon of Sins, and the Grace and Aſſiſtance of God's Spirit received, and a miraculous Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd for a Witneſs and Teſtimony to themſelves, of the undoubted Truth of that Religion which they have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. It is the higheſt Affront to the Son of God, who revealed this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the World, and ſealed it with his Blood; and, in effect, an expreſſion of as high Malice to the Author of this Religion, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were guilty of, when they put him to ſo cruel and ſhameful a Death.</p>
            <p>Now a Sin of this heinous Nature is apt naturally either to plunge Men into hardneſs and impenitency, or to drive them to deſpair; and either of theſe Conditions are effectual Barrs to their Recovery. And both theſe Dangers the Apoſtle warns Men of in this Epiſtle. <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Take heed, Brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil Heart of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, to apoſtatize from the living God: but exhort one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother daily, whilſt it is call'd to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58790:92"/>
deceitfulneſs of Sin.</hi> Or elſe the Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon ſo horrid a Crime is apt to drive a Man to Deſpair; as it did <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> who, after he had betray'd the <hi>Son of God,</hi> could find no eaſe but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away himſelf; the guilt of ſo great a Sin fill'd him with ſuch Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that he was glad to flye to Death for Refuge, and to lay violent hands upon himſelf. And this likewiſe was the Caſe of <hi>Spira,</hi> whoſe Apoſtacy, though it was not total from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, but only from the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Reformation of it, brought him to that deſperation of Mind which was a kind of Hell upon Earth. And of this danger likewiſe the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth, <hi>Ch.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Looking dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, leſt any man fail of the Grace of God</hi> (or as it is in the Margine, <hi>leſt any Man fall from the Grace of God) leſt any root of bitterneſs ſpringing up trouble you</hi>; and then he compares the Caſe of ſuch Perſons to <hi>Eſau,</hi> who, when he had renounced his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, to which the Bleſſing was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd, was afterwards when he would have inherited the Bleſſing, rejected, and <hi>found no place of Repentance, though he ſought it carefully with Tears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:58790:92"/>2<hi>dly.</hi> Thoſe who are guilty of this Sin, do renounce and caſt off the means of their Recovery; and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes extremely difficult <hi>to renew them again to repentance.</hi> They reject the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which affords the beſt Arguments and Means to Repentance, and renounce the only way of Pardon and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And certainly that Man is in a very ſad and deſperate Condition, the very nature of whoſe Diſeaſe is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Remedy that ſhould cure him. And this, the Apoſtle tells us, was the Condition of thoſe who apoſtatized from the Goſpel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.26, 27. <hi>For if we ſin wilfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more Sacrifice for Sin; but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſary.</hi> The great Sacrifice and Propitiation for Sin was <hi>the Son of God</hi>; and they who renounce him, what way of Expiation can they hope for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? what can they expect, but to fall into his Hands as a Judge, whom they have rejected as a Sacrifice and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? And then,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Thoſe who are guilty of this Sin, provoke God in the higheſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58790:93"/>
to withdraw his Grace and Holy Spirit from them, by the Power and Efficacy whereof they ſhould be brought to Repentance; ſo that it can hardly otherwiſe be expected, but that God ſhould leave thoſe to themſelves, who have ſo unworthily forſaken him; and wholly withdraw his Grace and Spirit from ſuch Perſons, as have ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly <hi>offer'd deſpite to the Spirit of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not ſay that God always does this, he is ſometimes better to ſuch Perſons than they have deſerved from him, and ſaves thoſe who have done what they can to undo themſelves, and mercifully puts forth his Hand to recover them who were <hi>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to Perdition</hi>; eſpecially if they were ſuddenly ſurprized by the violence of Temptation, and yielded to it, not deliberately and out of choice, but merely through weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and ſo ſoon as they reflected upon themſelves, did return and repent: This was the caſe of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurprized with a ſudden fear denied Chriſt; but being admoniſh'd of his Sin by the ſignal which our Saviour had given him, he was recovered by a ſpeedy and hearty Repentance. And
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58790:93"/>
ſo likewiſe ſeveral of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who were at firſt overcome by fear to renounce their Religion, did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards recover themſelves, and died reſolute Martyrs: but it is a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous State, out of which but few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and with great difficulty.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the <hi>five</hi> things I propounded to make out, for the clearing of this Text from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes and miſapprehenſions which have been about it. I ſhall now draw ſome uſeful Inferences from hence by way of Application, that we may ſee how far this doth concern our ſelves, and they ſhall be theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> From the Suppoſition here in the Text, that ſuch Perſons as are there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed (namely, thoſe who have been baptized, and by Baptiſm have received remiſſion of Sins, and did firmly believe the Goſpel, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of it, and were endowed with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt) that theſe may fall away; this ſhould caution us all againſt Confidence and Security; when thoſe that have gone thus far may fall, <hi>let him that ſtandeth take heed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some are of opinion, that thoſe whom the Apoſtle here deſcribes are
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58790:94"/>
true and ſincere Chriſtians, and that when he ſays, <hi>it is impoſſible if they fall away, to renew them again to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> he means that they cannot fall away totally, ſo as to ſtand in need of being renewed again to Repentance: But this is directly contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's deſign, which was to caution Chriſtians againſt Apoſtacy, becauſe if they did fall away, their recovery would be ſo exceeding difficult; which Argument does plainly ſuppoſe that they might fall away.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, there are others who think the Perſons, here deſcribed by the Apoſtle, to be Hypocritical Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who for ſome baſe ends had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained Chriſtianity, and put on the Profeſſion of it, but not being ſincere and in good earneſt, would forſake it when Perſecution came. But beſides that this is contrary to the deſcription which the Apoſtle makes of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are ſaid <hi>to have taſted of the Heavenly Gift, and to have been made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; by which if we underſtand Juſtification and Remiſſion of Sins, and the Sanctifying Virtue of the Holy Ghoſt, which in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is the meaning of theſe Phraſes,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58790:94"/>
theſe are Bleſſings which did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Hypocrites, and which God does not beſtow upon them; I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, there is no reaſon to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the Apoſtle intended ſuch Perſons, when it is likely that there were very few Hypocrites in thoſe times of Perſecution; for what ſhould tempt Men to diſſemble Chriſtianity, when it was ſo dangerous a Profeſſion? or what Worldly Ends could Men have in taking that Profeſſion upon them, which was ſo directly contrary to their Worldly Intereſts?</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole matter, I doubt not but the Apoſtle here means thoſe who are real in the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that ſuch <hi>might fall away.</hi> For we may eaſily imagine, that Men might be convinced of the Truth and Goodneſs of the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> and in good earneſt embrace the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it, and yet not be ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weaned from the World, and ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted and eſtabliſhed in that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, as when it came to the Trial, to be able to quit all for it, and to bear up againſt all the Terrors and Aſſaults of Perſecution; ſo that they might be real Chriſtians, and no Hypocrites,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58790:95"/>
though they were not ſo perfectly eſtabliſhed and confirmed, and ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely reſolved as many others. They were not like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and thoſe tried Perſons whom he ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 37. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, or peril, or ſword? Nay, in all theſe things we are more than Conquerors.</hi> (They had been tried by all theſe, and yet had held out) upon which he breaks out into thoſe triumphant Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>I am perſuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> They might not (I ſay) be like thoſe: and yet for all that be real in their Profeſſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and no Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I take them to be ſuch as our Saviour deſcribes him to be, <hi>who received the ſeed into ſtony places,</hi> namely, <hi>he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it: yet hath he not root in himſelf, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58790:95"/>
the word, by and by he is offended.</hi> This is no deſcription of a Hypocrite; but of one that was real, as far as he went, (for he is ſaid <hi>to receive the word with joy</hi>) but was not well rooted, and come to ſuch a confirmed State, as reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to withſtand the aſſaults of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>So that tho' we have truly embraced Chriſtianity, and are in a good degree ſincere in the Profeſſion of it, yet there is great Reaſon why we ſhould neither be <hi>ſecure</hi> nor <hi>confident in our ſelves.</hi> Not <hi>ſecure,</hi> becauſe there is great danger that our Reſolution may be born down one time or other by the Aſſaults of Temptation, if we be not continually vigilant, and upon our Guard. Not <hi>confident in our ſelves</hi>; becauſe <hi>we ſtand by Faith, and Faith is the gift of God</hi>; therefore as the Apoſtle infers, <hi>we ſhould not be high-minded, but fear.</hi> Men may have gone a great way in Chriſtianity, and have been ſincere in the Profeſſion of it; and yet afterwards may apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in the fouleſt manner, not only fall off to a vicious Life, but even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Profeſſion of their Religion. I would to God the Experience of the World did not give us too much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58790:96"/>
to believe the Poſſibility of this. When we ſee ſo many revolt from the Profeſſion of the Reformed Religion, to the Corruptions and Superſtitions of <hi>Rome</hi>; And others from a religious and ſober Life, to plunge themſelves into all kind of Lewdneſs and Debauchery, and it is to be feared, into Atheiſm and Infidelity; Can we doubt any longer whether it be poſſible for Chriſtians to fall away? I wiſh we were as certain of the poſſibility of their Recovery, as we are of their Falling, and that we had as many Examples of the one as of the other.</p>
            <p>Let us then be very vigilant over our ſelves, and according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Exhortation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we know theſe things before, beware, leſt we alſo being led away with the Error of the wicked, fall from our own ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> This ſhews us how great an Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation it is, for Men to Sin againſt the Means of Knowledge which the Goſpel affords, and the Mercies which it offers unto them. That which ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated the Sin of theſe Perſons was, that after they <hi>were once enlightned,</hi> that is, at their Baptiſm were inſtructed in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58790:96"/>
the Chriſtian Doctrine, the cleareſt and moſt perfect Revelation that ever was made of God's Will to Mankind, that after they were <hi>juſtified freely by God's Grace,</hi> and had received Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins, and had many other Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits conferred upon them; that after all this, they ſhould fall off from this <hi>Holy Religion.</hi> This was that which did ſo heighten and enflame their Guilt, and made their Caſe ſo near deſperate. The two great aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Crimes are Wilfulneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude; if a Crime be wilfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and committed againſt one that hath obliged us by the greateſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Benefits. Now he commits a fault wilfully, who does it againſt the clear knowledge of his Duty. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance excuſeth; for ſo far as a Man is ignorant of the Evil he does, ſo far the Action is involuntary: but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge makes it to be a wilful Fault. And this is a more peculiar Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sins of Chriſtians, becauſe God hath afforded them the greateſt means and opportunities of Knowledge; that Revelation which God hath made of his Will to the World by our Bleſſed Saviour, is the cleareſt Light that ever
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58790:97"/>
Mankind had, and the mercies which the Goſpel brings are the greateſt that ever were offer'd to the Sons of Men; the free Pardon and Remiſſion of all our Sins, and the aſſiſtance of God's Grace and Holy Spirit, to help the weakneſs of our Nature, and enable us to do what God requires of us. So that we who ſin after Baptiſm, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knowledge of Chriſtianity, and thoſe great Bleſſings which the Goſpel beſtows on Mankind, are of all Perſons in the World the moſt inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable. The Sins of Heathens bear no proportion to ours, becauſe they never enjoyed thoſe means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, never had thoſe Bleſſings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them, which Chriſtians are partakers of; ſo that we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to our ſelves thoſe ſevere words of the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> Hear how our Saviour aggravates the Faults of Men upon this account, of the wilfulneſs of them, and their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed againſt the expreſs Knowledge of God's Will; <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47, 48. <hi>The Servant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did according to his will, ſhall be beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58790:97"/>
with many ſtripes; for unto whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much is given, of him ſhall much be required; and to whom Men have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much, of him they will ask the more.</hi> The Means and Mercies of the Goſpel are ſo many Talents committed to our Truſt, of the neglect whereof a ſevere Account will be taken at the Day of Judgment. If we be wilful offenders, there is no Excuſe for us, and little hopes of Pardon. <hi>If we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth,</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle) <hi>there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin.</hi> I know the Apoſtle ſpeaks this particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Sin of <hi>Apoſtacy from Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; but it is in proportion true of all other Sins, which thoſe who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Knowledge of the Truth are guilty of. They, who after they have entertained Chriſtianity, and made ſome progreſs in it, and been in ſome meaſure reformed by it, do again relapſe into any vicious courſe, do thereby render their Condition very dangerous. So St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21. <hi>If after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again entangled therein,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58790:98"/>
and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning. For it had been better for them, not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them.</hi> Therefore we may do well to conſider ſeriouſly what we do, when, under the Means and Opportunities of Knowledge which the Goſpel, affords us, and the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Bleſſings and Favours which it confers upon us, we live in any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vicious courſe. Our Sins are not of a common rate, when they have ſo much of Wilfulneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs in them. If Men ſhall be ſeverely puniſh'd for living againſt the Light of Nature; what vengeance ſhall be poured on thoſe who offend againſt the Glorious Light of the Goſpel? <hi>This is the Condemnation, that Light is come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The Conſideration of what hath been ſaid is Matter of Comfort to thoſe, who upon every Failing and Infirmity are afraid they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>the unpardonable Sin,</hi> and that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to be reſtor'd by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. There are many who being of a dark and melancholy Temper,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58790:98"/>
are apt to repreſent things worſe to themſelves than there is reaſon for, and do many times fancy themſelves guilty of great Crimes, in the doing or neglecting of thoſe things which in their nature are indifferent, and are apt to aggravate and blow up every little Infirmity into an unpardonable Sin. Moſt Men are apt to extenuate their Sins, and not to be ſenſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the Evil and Heinouſneſs of them; but it is the peculiar Infelicity of Melancholy Perſons, to look upon their Faults as blacker and greater, than in truth they are; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they hear and read in Scripture, that is ſpoken againſt the groſſeſt and moſt enormous Offenders, they apply to themſelves; and when they hear of the <hi>Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>the Sin unto Death,</hi> or read this Text which I am now treating of, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conclude that they are guilty of theſe Sins, and that this is a deſcription of their Caſe. Whereas <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi> is of that nature, that probably none but thoſe that ſaw our Saviour's Miracles are capable of committing it; and excepting <hi>that,</hi> there is no Sin whatſoever that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58790:99"/>
As for <hi>the Sin unto Death,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> here ſpoken of in the Text, I have ſhewn that they are a total Apoſtacy from the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> more eſpecially to the Heathen Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; which theſe Perſons I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, have no reaſon to imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of. And though great and notorious Crimes committed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, may come near to this, and it may be very hard for thoſe who are guilty of them, to recover themſelves again to Repentance; yet to be ſure, for the common Frailties and Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Human Nature, there is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen way of Pardon in the Goſpel, and they are many times forgiven to us upon a General Repentance; ſo that upon account of theſe, which is commonly the caſe of the Perſons I am ſpeaking of, there is not the leaſt ground of Deſpair; and though it be hard many times for ſuch Perſons to receive Comfort, yet it is eaſy to give it, and that upon ſure Grounds, and as clear Evidence of Scripture, as there is for any thing; ſo that the firſt thing that ſuch Perſons, who are ſo apt to judge thus hardly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are to be convinced of (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58790:99"/>
is this, that they ought rather to truſt the Judgment of others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themſelves, than their own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, which is ſo diſtemper'd, that it cannot make a true Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things. I know that where Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy does mightily prevail, it is hard to perſuade People of this: but 'till they be perſuaded of it, I am ſure all the Reaſon in the World will ſignify nothing to them.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> This ſhould make Men afraid of great and preſumptuous Sins, which come near Apoſtacy from Chriſtianity; ſuch as deliberate Murder, Adultery, groſs Fraud and Oppreſſion, or noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and habitual Intemperance. For what great difference is there, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men renounce Chriſtianity; or profeſſing to believe it, <hi>do in their Works deny it?</hi> Some of theſe Sins which I have mention'd, particularly Murder and Adultery, were ranked in the ſame degree with Apoſtacy, by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church; and ſo ſevere was the Diſcipline of many Churches, that Perſons guilty of theſe Crimes, were never admitted to the Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church again, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Teſtimony, they gave of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58790:100"/>
I will not ſay but this was too rigorous; but this ſhews how inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity theſe Crimes, and others of the like degree of heinouſneſs, were in thoſe days thought to be. They did not indeed, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, think ſuch Perſons abſolutely incapable of the Mercy of God; but after ſuch a Fall, ſo notorious a Contradiction to their Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, they thought it unfit afterwards that they ſhould ever be reckon'd in the number of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> It may be uſeful for us upon this Occaſion to reflect a liltle upon the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Diſcipline of the Church, which in ſome places (as I have told you) was ſo ſevere, as in caſe of ſome great Crimes after Baptiſm, as Apoſtacy to the Heathen Idolatry, Murder, and Adultery, never to admit thoſe that were guilty of them, to the Peace and Communion of the Church; but in all Churches was ſo ſtrict, as not to admit thoſe who fell after Baptiſm into great and notorious Crimes, to Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Church, but after a long and tedious courſe of Penance, after the greateſt and moſt publick Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Sorrow and Repentance, after
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58790:100"/>
long Faſting and Tears, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſigns of Humiliation that can be imagined. In caſe of the greateſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences they were ſeldom reconciled, till they came to lye upon their Death-beds: And in caſe of other ſcandalous Sins, not 'till after the Humiliation of many Years This perhaps may be thought too great Severity; but I am ſure we are as much too remiſs now, as they were over rigorous then: but were the Ancient Diſcipline of the Church in any degree put in practice now, what caſe would the generality of Chriſtians be in? In what Herds and Shoals would Men be driven out of the Communion of the Church? 'Tis true, the prodigious Degeneracy and Corruption of Chriſtians hath long ſince broke theſe Bounds, and 'tis morally impoſſible to revive the ſtrictneſs of the ancient Diſcipline in any meaſure, till the World grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but yet we ought to reflect, with ſhame and confuſion of Face, upon the purer Ages of the Church, and ſadly to conſider, how few among us would in thoſe Days have been accounted Chriſtians; and upon this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be provoked to an Emulation
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58790:101"/>
of thoſe Better Times, and to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of thoſe Faults and Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, which in the beſt days of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity were reckon'd inconſiſtent with the Chriſtian Profeſſion; and to remember that though the Diſcipline of the Church be not now the ſame it was then, yet the Judgment and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of God is; and that thoſe who live in any vicious courſe of Life, though they continue in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, yet they ſhall be <hi>ſhut out of the Kingdom of God. We are ſure that the Judgment of God will be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Truth, againſt them which commit ſuch things,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> and laſtly, The Conſideration of what hath been ſaid, ſhould confirm and eſtabliſh us in the Profeſſion of our Holy Religion. 'Tis true, we are not now in danger of apoſtatizing from Chriſtianity to the Heathen Idolatry; but we have too many ſad Examples of thoſe who apoſtatize from the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Goſpel, which they have taken upon them in Baptiſm, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Infidelity, to all manner of Impiety and Lewdneſs. There are many who daily fall off from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> to the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58790:101"/>
groſs Errors and Superſtitions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which in many things does too nearly reſemble the old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Idolatry. And what the Apoſtle here ſays of the Apoſtates of his time, is proportionably true of thoſe of our days, that <hi>they who thus fall away,</hi> it is <hi>extremely difficult to renew them again to Repentance.</hi> And it ought to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that the guilt of this kind of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy hath driven ſome to Deſpair; as in the Caſe of <hi>Spira,</hi> who, for reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Light and Convictions of his Mind, was caſt into thoſe Agonies, and fill'd with ſuch Terrors, as if <hi>the very pains of Hell had taken hold on him</hi>; and in that fearful Deſpair, and in the midſt of thoſe Horrors, he breathed out his Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us then hold faſt the Profeſſion of our Faith without wavering</hi>; and let us take heed how we contradict the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our Faith, by any Impiety and Wickedneſs in our Lives; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that <hi>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God.</hi> I will conclude with the words of the Apoſtle immediately after the Text, <hi>The earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58790:102"/>
them by whom it is dreſſed, receiveth bleſſing from God. But that which beareth thorns and briars, is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned.</hi> And how gladly would I add the next words! <hi>But, beloved, we are perſwaded better things of you, and things that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſalvation, though we thus ſpeak.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> made perfect; and therefore when he was giving up the Ghoſt upon the Croſs, he ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 19.30. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>it is finiſh'd,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; that is, he had done all that was neceſſary to be done, by way of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for our Redemption. And the ſame word is likewiſe uſed <hi>Luke</hi> 13.32. concernining our Saviour's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>I do cures to day and to morrow, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the third day I ſhall be perfected</hi>; this he ſpake concerning his own death. And therefore, <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.10. God is ſaid <hi>to make the Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation perfect through Sufferings</hi>; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And thus our High Prieſt being <hi>made perfect</hi> in this Senſe,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58790:104"/>
that is, having finiſh'd his Courſe, which was accompliſhed in his Sufferings, and having received the Reward of them, in being exalted at the Right Hand of God, <hi>he became the Author of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> You have here the qualification of the Perſons, who are made Partakers of this great Benefit, or the Condition upon which it is ſuſpended, and that is <hi>Obedience; he became the Author of eternal Salvation to them that obey him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the main things contained in the Text. For the fuller Explication whereof, I ſhall take into conſideration theſe five things.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> How, and by what means Chriſt is the <hi>Author of our Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> What <hi>Obedience</hi> the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as a Condition, and is pleaſed to accept as a Qualification, in thoſe who hope for eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> We will conſider the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of performing this Condition, by that Grace and Aſſiſtance which is offer'd, and ready to be afforded to us by the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> The <hi>neceſſity</hi> of this <hi>Obedience,</hi> in order to Eternal Life and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And 5<hi>thly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew that this is no
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58790:104"/>
prejudice to the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> and the <hi>free Grace and Mercy</hi> of God, declared in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> We will conſider how, and by what means <hi>Chriſt is the Author of our Salvation</hi>; and this is contain'd in theſe words, <hi>Being made perfect, he became the Author of Eternal Salvation,</hi> that is (as I told you before) having finiſh'd his Courſe which was accompliſh'd in his laſt Sufferings; and having received the Reward of them, being exalted at the right hand of God, he became the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of eternal Salvation</hi> to us; ſo that by all that he did, and ſuffer'd for us, in the days of his Fleſh, and in the ſtate of his Humiliation, and by all that he ſtill continues to do for us, now that he is in Heaven at the right hand of God; he hath effected and brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the great Work of our Salvation. His Doctrine and his Life, his Death and Sufferings, his Reſurrection from the Dead, and his powerful Interceſſion for us at the Right Hand of God, have all a great influence upon the reforming and ſaving of Mankind; and by all theſe Ways and Means, he is <hi>the Author</hi> and Cauſe <hi>of our Salvation</hi>; as a Rule, and as a Pattern, as a Price and Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58790:105"/>
and as a Patron and Advocate that is continually pleading our Cauſe, and interceding with God on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, <hi>for mercy and grace to help in time of need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed our condition requir'd an High Prieſt who was qualified in all theſe reſpects, for the recovery of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind out of that corrupt and degenerate ſtate into which it was ſunk; an High Prieſt <hi>whoſe lips ſhould preſerve knowledge,</hi> and from whoſe mouth we might learn the Law of God; whoſe Life ſhould be a perfect Pattern of Holineſs to us, and his Death a propitiation for the ſins of the whole World; and by whoſe Grace and Aſſiſtance, we ſhould be endowed with Power and Strength to mortifie our Luſts, and to perfect Holineſs in the Fear of God; and therefore <hi>ſuch an High Priſt became us, who was holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, undefiled, and ſeparate from Sinners, who might have compaſſion on the ignorant, and them that are out of the way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf compaſt with infirmities, might have the feeling of ours, being in all points tempted as we are, only without ſin</hi>; and, in a word, <hi>might be able to ſave to the utmoſt all thoſe that come to God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:58790:105"/>By theſe Qualifications our High Prieſt is deſcribed in this Epiſtle; and by theſe he is every way ſuited to all our Defects and Infirmities, all our Wants and Neceſſities; to inſtruct our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by his Doctrine, and to lead us in the Path of Righteouſneſs by his moſt Holy and moſt Exemplary Life; to expiate the guilt of our Sins by his Death; and to procure Grace and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for us, by his prevalent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion on our behalf. By all theſe ways, and in all theſe reſpects, he is ſaid to be <hi>the Author of eternal Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> By the Holineſs and Purity of his Doctrine, whereby we are perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Will of God and our Duty, and powerfully excited and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to the practice of it. The Rules and Directions of a Holy Life were very obſcure before, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Encouragements to Virtue but weak and ineffectual, in compariſon of what they are now render'd by the Revelation of the Goſpel. The general corruption of Mankind, and the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Practice of the World, had in a great meaſure blurr'd and defac'd the Natural Law; ſo that the Heathen World, for many Ages, had but a very
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:58790:106"/>
dark and doubtful knowledge of their Duty, eſpecially as to ſeveral inſtances of it. The Cuſtom of ſeveral Vices had ſo prevail'd among Mankind, as almoſt quite to extinguiſh the natural Senſe of their Evil and Deformity. And the <hi>Jews,</hi> who injoy'd a conſiderable degree of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation,</hi> had no ſtrict regard to the Morality of their Actions; and contenting themſelves with ſome kind of outward Conformity to the bare <hi>Letter</hi> of the Ten Commandments, were almoſt wholly taken up with little Ceremonies and Obſervances, in which they placed the main of their Religion, almoſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglecting the greater Duties <hi>and weightier matters of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore our Bleſſed Saviour, to free Mankind from theſe wandrings and uncertainties about the Will of God, revealed the Moral Law, and explained the full force and meaning of it, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all doubts, and ſupplying all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, by a more particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Declaration of the ſeveral parts of our Duty, and by Precepts of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Perfection, than the World was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently acquainted withal before; of greater Humility and more Univerſal Charity; of abſtaining from Revenge,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58790:106"/>
and forgiving Injuries, and returning to our Enemies Good for Evil, and Love for ill-will, and Bleſſings and Prayers for Curſes and Perſecutions. Theſe Virtues indeed were ſometimes, and yet but very rarely, recommended before in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wiſe Men; but either not in that degree of Perfection, or not under that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Neceſſity, and as having the force of Laws, and laying an univerſal obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of indiſpenſable Duty upon all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>And as our bleſſed Saviour hath given a greater clearneſs, and Certainty, and Perfection, to the rule of our Duty, ſo he hath reveal'd, and brought into a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Light, more powerful Motives and Encouragements to the conſtant and careful Practice of it; for <hi>Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality are brought to light by the Goſpel</hi>; the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the Dead being a plain and convincing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the <hi>Immortality of our Souls,</hi> and another Life after this, and an Evidence to us both of his Power, and of the fidelity of his promiſe, to raiſe us from the Dead. Not but that Mankind had ſome obſcure Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe things before. Good Men had always good hopes of another Life
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58790:107"/>
and future Rewards in another World; and the worſt of Men were not without ſome fears of the Judgment and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of another World: but Men had diſputed themſelves into great doubts and uncertainties about theſe things; and as Men that are in doubt, are almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different which way they go; ſo the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain apprehenſions which Men had of a future State, and of the Rewards and Puniſhments of another World, had but a very faint influence upon the Minds of Men, and wanted that preſſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining force to Virtue and a good Life, which a firm Belief and clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of theſe things, would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into them.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> hath ſcatter'd all theſe Clouds, and chaſed away that groſs Darkneſs which hid the other World from our ſight, and hath removed all doubts concerning the Immortality of Mens Souls, and their future State; and now <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> with all its Treaſures of Life, and Happineſs, and Glory, lies open to our view, and <hi>Hell is alſo naked before us, and deſtruction hath no covering.</hi> So that the hopes and fears of Men are now perfectly awakened, and all ſorts of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58790:107"/>
Conſiderations that may ſerve to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and encourage our Obedience, and to deter and affright Men from a wicked Life, are expoſed to the view of all Men, and do ſtare every Man's Conſcience in the face. And this is that which renders the Goſpel ſo admirable and powerful an Inſtrument for the reforming of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and, as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>the mighty power of God unto Salvation</hi>; becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Life and Immortality are ſet before us, as the certain and glorious Reward of our Obedience; and <hi>therein</hi> alſo <hi>the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi> So that conſidering the perfection of our Rule, and the powerful enforcements of it upon the Conſciences of Men, by the clear diſcovery and firm aſſurance of the Eternal Recompence of another World; nothing can be imagined better ſuited to its end, than the Doctrine of the Goſpel is to make Men wiſe, and holy, and good, unto Salvation; both by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them perfectly in their Duty, and urging them powerfully to the practice of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The Example of our Saviour's life is likewiſe another excellent Means to this End. The Law lays an Obligation
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58790:108"/>
upon us; but a Pattern gives life and encouragement, and renders our Duty more eaſie, and practicable, and familiar to us; for here we ſee obedience to the Divine Law practiced in our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and performed by a Man like our ſelves, <hi>in all things like unto us, Sin only excepted.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes a great difference, and ſeems to take off very much from the encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Force and Virtue of this <hi>Example.</hi> No wonder if he that was without Sin, and was God as well as Man, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Righteouſneſs; and therefore, where is the encouragement of this <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?</hi> That our Nature, pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted, ſupported and aſſiſted by the Divinity to which it was united, ſhould be perfectly confomed to the Law of God, as it is no ſtrange thing, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it ſeem to have that force and encouragement in it, which an Example more ſuited to our weakneſs might have had. But then this cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, that it hath the advantage of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which a Pattern ought to have, and to which, though we can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yet we may always be aſpiring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; and certainly we cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter learn, how God would have Men
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58790:108"/>
to live, than by ſeeing how God himſelf lived, when he was pleaſed to aſſume our Nature, and to become Man.</p>
            <p>And then, we are to conſider, that the Son of God did not aſſume our Nature in its higheſt Glory and Perfection, but compaſt with Infirmities, and liable in all points to be tempted like as we are; but ſtill it was without Sin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth not exact from us perfect Obedience, and that we ſhould <hi>fulfil all Righteouſneſs,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> did; he makes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for the corruption of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is pleaſed to accept of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, though very imperfect Obedience. But after all this, his <hi>humane Nature</hi> was united to the <hi>Divinity,</hi> and he had the <hi>Spirit without meaſure</hi>; and this would indeed make a wide difference between us and our <hi>Pattern,</hi> as to the purpoſe of Holineſs and Obedience, if we were deſtitute of that aſſiſtance which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeſſary to enable us to the diſcharge of our Duty; But this God offers, and is ready to afford to us, for he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>to give his holy Spirit to them that ask him</hi>: and <hi>the Spirit of him that raiſed up Chriſt Jeſus from the Dead</hi> dwells in all good men, who ſincerely deſire to do the Will of God; <hi>in the working out our
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58790:109"/>
Salvation, God worketh in us both to will and to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that as to that Obedience which the Goſpel requires of us, if we be not wanting to our ſelves; if we do not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Grace of God in vain,</hi> and <hi>quench and reſiſt his bleſſed Spirit,</hi> we may be as really aſſiſted as <hi>the Son of God</hi> himſelf was; for, in this reſpect, all true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtians are <hi>the Sons of God</hi>; ſo that St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if all things be duly conſider'd, the Life of our bleſſed Saviour, as it is the moſt perfect, ſo in the main, it is a very proper <hi>Pattern</hi> for our imitation, and could not have come nearer to us, without wanting that perfection which is neceſſary to a compleat and abſolute Pattern. <hi>The Son of God</hi> conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to every thing that might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him the moſt familiar and equal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to us, excepting <hi>that,</hi> which as it was impoſſible, ſo had been infinitely diſhonourable to him, and would have ſpoil'd the perfection of his Example; he came as near to us as was fit or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>being in all things like unto us, Sin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted</hi>; that is, abating that one
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58790:109"/>
thing, which he came to deſtroy and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh, and which would have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the very end of his coming; for if he had not been <hi>without Sin,</hi> he could neither have made an <hi>expiation</hi> for Sin, nor have been a perfect <hi>Pattern</hi> of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Obedience.</p>
            <p>And as the Life of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had all the perfection that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to an <hi>abſolute Pattern</hi> (ſo that by conſidering his Temper and Spirit, and the actions of his Life, we may reform all the vicious inclinations of our Minds, and the exorbitances of our Paſſions, and the errors and irregularities of our Lives) ſo it is a very <hi>powerful Example,</hi> and of great force to oblige and provoke us to the imitation of it; for it is the Example of one whom we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and have reaſon to love, above any Perſon in the World: The Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Prince and Soveraign Lord, of our beſt Friend and greateſt Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, of the High Prieſt of our Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Captain of our Salvation, of the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, of one who came down from Heaven for our ſakes, and was contented to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume our Nature together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of it, and to live in a low and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58790:110"/>
mean condition, for no other reaſon but that he might have the opportunity to inſtruct and lead Mankind in the way to Life, to deliver us from Sin and Wrath, and to bring us to God and Happineſs. 'Tis the Example of one who laid down his Life for us, and ſealed his Love to us in his Blood, and whilſt we were Enemies, did and ſuffer'd more for us, than ever any Man did for his Friend.</p>
            <p>And ſurely theſe Conſiderations can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but mightily recommend and endear to us this <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> We are ambitious to imitate thoſe whom we highly eſteem and reverence, and are apt to have their Examples in great veneration, from whom we have received great Kindneſſes and Benefits, and are always endeavouring to be like thoſe whom we love, and are apt to conform our ſelves to the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe from whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great Favours, and who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually heaping great Obligations upon us.</p>
            <p>So that whether we conſider the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of our Pattern, or the mighty Endearments of it to us, by that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Love and Kindneſs which he hath
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58790:110"/>
expreſt towards us, we have all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and all the provocation in the World, to endeavour to be like him; for who would not gladly tread in the ſteps of <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and of the beſt Friend that the Sons of Men ever had? Who will not follow <hi>that Example</hi> to which we ſtand indebted for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bleſſings and Benefits that ever were procured for Mankind? Thus you ſee of what force and advantage the <hi>Example</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour is toward the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Salvation of Mankind.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> He is <hi>the Author of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> as he hath purchaſed it for us, by the <hi>Merit of his Obedience and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> by which he hath obtained Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Redemption for us; not only delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the wrath to come, but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life and Happineſs, when by our Sins we had juſtly incurred the wrath and diſpleaſure of Almighty God, and were liable to Eternal Death and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He was contented to be ſubſtituted a Sacrifice for us, <hi>to bear our Sins in his own Body on the Tree,</hi> and to expiate the guilt of all our Offences by his own Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. He died <hi>for us,</hi> that is, not only for our Benefit and Advantage, but in our place and ſtead; ſo that if he had
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58790:111"/>
not died we had eternally periſh'd; and becauſe he died, we are ſaved from that eternal Ruin and Puniſhment, which was due to us for our Sins.</p>
            <p>And this, tho' it be no where in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture call'd by the Name or Term of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> yet, which is the ſame thing in effect, it is call'd <hi>the prize of our Redemption</hi>; for as we are Sinners, we are liable and indebted to the Juſtice of God, and our bleſſed Saviour by his Death and Sufferings hath diſcharged this Obligation; which Diſcharge, ſince it was obtained for us by <hi>the ſhedding of his precious Blood, without which,</hi> the Scripture expreſly ſays, <hi>there had been no Remiſſion of Sin,</hi> why it may not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough be called <hi>Payment</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> I confeſs I cannot underſtand. Not that God was angry with his Son, for he was always well pleaſed with him; or that our Saviour ſuffer'd the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame which the Sinner ſhould have done in his own Perſon, the proper Pains and Torments of the damned: but that his perfect Obedience and grievous Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, undergone for our ſakes, and upon our account, were of that Value and Eſteem with God, and his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Sacrifice of himſelf in our ſtead, ſo
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58790:111"/>
highly acceptable and well pleaſing to him, that he thereupon was pleaſed to enter into a Covenant of Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with Mankind; wherein he hath promiſed and engaged himſelf to forgive the Sins of all thoſe who ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, and to make them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Eternal Life. And hence it is, that the Blood of Chriſt, which was ſhed for us upon the Croſs, is call'd <hi>the Blood of the Covenant</hi>; as being the Sanction of that new Covenant of the Goſpel, into which God is entred with Mankind; and not only the Confirmation, but the very Foundation of it; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Cup in the Lord's Supper (which repreſents to us the Blood of Chriſt) is call'd <hi>the New Teſtament in his Blood, which was ſhed for many for the remiſſion of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>the Author of our Salvation,</hi> in reſpect of his powerful and perpetual <hi>Interceſſion</hi> for us at the right Hand of God. And this ſeems to be more eſpecially intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and intended, in that Expreſſion here in the Text, that <hi>being made perfect he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Author of eternal Salvation to them that obey him.</hi> Which Words of <hi>his being perfected,</hi> do, as I have ſhew'd
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58790:112"/>
before, more immediately refer to his Sufferings, and the Reward that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, <hi>his Exaltation at the right hand of God,</hi> where <hi>he lives for ever to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us?</hi> by which perpetual and moſt prevalent <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of his, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures all thoſe Benefits to be beſtowed upon us, which he purchaſed for us by his Death; the forgiveneſs of our Sins, and our Acceptance with God, and perfect Reſtitution to his Favour, upon our Faith and Repentance, and the Grace and Aſſiſtance of God's holy Spirit to inable us to a ſincere Diſcharge of our Duty, to ſtrengthen us againſt all the Temptations of the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, to keep us from all Evil, and to preſerve us to his Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>And this is that which our Apoſtle calls <hi>obtaining of Mercy, and finding Grace to help in time of need,</hi> ch. 4. v. 16. of this Epiſt. Our bleſſed Saviour, now that he is advanced into Heaven, and <hi>exalted on the right hand of the Majeſty on high,</hi> doth out of the tendereſt Affection and Compaſſion to Mankind, ſtill proſecute that great and merciful Deſign of our Salvation which was begun by him here on Earth, and in Virtue of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious

Obedience and Sufferings does offer up our Prayers to God, and as it were plead our Cauſe with God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to him all our Wants and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and obtain a favourable Anſwer of our Petitions put up to God in his Name, and all neceſſary ſupplies of Grace and Strength, Proportionable to our Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Infirmities.</p>
            <p>And by Virtue of this powerful <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, our Sins are pardoned upon our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance, our Prayers are graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly anſwered, our Wants are abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplied, and the Grace and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God's Spirit are plentifully afforded to us, to excite us to our Duty, to ſtrengthen us in well doing, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us in Afflictions, to ſupport us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greateſt Tryals and Sufferings, and <hi>to keep us through Faith unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this reaſon, as the purchaſing of our Salvation is in Scripture attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt; ſo the perfecting and finiſhing of it is aſcribed to the prevalency of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion at the right Hand of God for us. So the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>ch.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 25. That <hi>he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all thoſe that come to God by him; ſeeing he ever
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58790:113"/>
liveth to make Interceſſion for us.</hi> He dyed once to purchaſe Salvation for us; and that we may not fall ſhort of it, but receive the full Benefit of this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, <hi>he lives for ever to make Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us</hi>; and thus <hi>he ſaves to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all thoſe that come to God by him</hi>; that is, he takes care of the whole buſineſs of our Salvation from firſt to laſt. And now that he is in Heaven, he is as intent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Welfare and Happineſs, and as tenderly concerned for us, as when he lived here among us upon Earth, as when he hung upon the Croſs, and <hi>poured out his Soul an Offering for our Sins</hi>; for he appears at the right Hand of God in our Nature, that which he aſſumed for our ſakes, which was made ſubject to, and ſenſible of our Infirmities, and which <hi>was tempted in all things like as we are, only without Sin</hi>; and therefore <hi>he knows how to pity</hi> and ſuccour <hi>them that are tempted</hi>; and from the remembrance of his own Sufferings, is prompted to a compaſſionate Senſe of ours, and never ceaſeth in virtue of his Blood, which was ſhed for us, to plead our Cauſe with God, and to intercede powerfully on our behalf.</p>
            <p>So that the Virtue and Efficacy of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58790:113"/>
Chriſt's <hi>Interceſſion</hi> on our behalf, is founded in the Redemption, which he wrought for us, by his Blood and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; which, being entred into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he repreſents to God on our Behalf. As the high Prieſt under the Law did enter into the holy place, with the Blood of the Sacrifices that had been offered, and in virtue of that Blood, interceded for the People: <hi>So Chriſt by his own Blood entred into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal Redemption for us</hi>; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>ch.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 12. He entred into <hi>the Holy Place,</hi> that is <hi>into Heaven it ſelf,</hi> to make <hi>Interceſſion</hi> for us, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle explains himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Chriſt is not entred into the holy places which are made with hands; but into Heaven it ſelf, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> And <hi>ch.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 12. ſpeaking of Chriſt's appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for us at the right Hand of God, <hi>this Man</hi> (ſays he) <hi>after he had offer'd one Sacrifice for Sin for ever</hi> (that is, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of perpetual Virtue and Efficacy) <hi>ſat down at the right Hand of God,</hi> that is to intercede for us in virtue of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
            <p>From all which it appears that the Virtue of Chriſt's Mediation and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us in Heaven, is founded in
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58790:114"/>
his Sacrifice, and the price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which he paid on Earth, in ſhedding his Blood for us.</p>
            <p>From whence the Apoſtle reaſons, that <hi>there is but one Mediator between God and Men,</hi> by whom we are to addreſs our Prayers to God; 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Ranſome for all.</hi> His Mediation is founded in his Ranſome, or the Price which he paid for our Redemption. The Apoſtle indeed does not ſay there is <hi>but one Mediator</hi> between God and Man in expreſs words, but ſurely he means ſo; if by ſaying <hi>there is one God,</hi> he means there is <hi>but one God</hi>; for they are joined together, and the very ſame Expreſſion uſed concerning both; <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men</hi>: that is, there is <hi>but one God,</hi> and <hi>one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</hi> But then, they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> endeavour to avoid this plain Text, by diſtinguiſhing between a <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and a <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Interceſſion</hi>: But now if Chriſt's <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> by way of <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> be founded in the Virtue of his <hi>Redemption</hi>; then if there be but <hi>one Mediator</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> then there is but <hi>one Mediator</hi> of <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:58790:114"/>
in Heaven for us. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſome for all.</hi> So that the Power and Prevalency of his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> is founded in his <hi>Ranſome,</hi> that is, <hi>the Price of our Redemption</hi>; in virtue whereof alone he intercedes with God for us, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> does moſt plainly aſſert. So that all other Interceſſors in Heaven for us are excluded from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and preſenting our Prayers to God, beſides <hi>our High Prieſt, who is at the right hand of God, and lives for ever, to make interceſſion for us,</hi> and by virtue of his <hi>Interceſſion, is able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt all thoſe that come to God by him,</hi> that is, who put up their Prayers to God in the alone Virtue of his <hi>Mediation.</hi> So that as there is no need of any other, if his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> be available <hi>to ſave to the uttermoſt:</hi> So there is great danger in applying to any other (whether Saint or Angel, or even the Bleſſed Virgin) if the benefit of his <hi>Innerceſſion</hi> be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe <hi>who come to God by him.</hi> And thus I have ſhewn by what means Chriſt is <hi>the Author of our Salvation</hi>; which was the <hi>firſt</hi> thing I propos'd to be conſider'd. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:58790:115"/>
               <hi>Second</hi> thing I propoſed to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; namely, what <hi>Obedience</hi> the Goſpel requires as a Condition, and is pleaſed to accept as a Qualification in thoſe who hope for <hi>Eternal Salvation.</hi> And this I ſhall explain, firſt <hi>Negatively,</hi> and then <hi>Poſitively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt, Negatively</hi>; It is not a mere out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and owning of Chriſt for our Lord and Law-giver, that will be accepted in this caſe. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> By which we may very reaſonably underſtand, all that profeſſion of Religion, which falls ſhort of <hi>Obedience</hi> and a <hi>Holy Life</hi>; as the profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, being baptized into his Name and Religion, the mere belief of his Doctrine, and the ownig of him for our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; no, nor the external Worſhip of him, and profeſſion of Subjection to him, by Prayer and hearing his Word, and communicating in the Holy Sacrament. No, though this be ſet off in the moſt glorious manner, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying and working Miracles in his Name; for ſo it follows in the next words, <hi>Many ſhall ſay to me in that day.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58790:115"/>
Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name have caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and in thy Name have done many wondrous works? We have eat and drank in thy preſence, and have heard thee preach in our Streets.</hi> But he tells us, that nothing of all this, without Obedience to his Laws, will be ſufficient to gain us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly, Poſitively</hi>; That which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as a Condition, and will accept as a Qualification in thoſe who hope for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, is Faith in Chriſt, and a ſincere and univerſal Obedience to the Precepts of his Holy Goſpel. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God: but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And here in the Text it is expreſly ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt is the Author of Eternal Salvation to them that obey him,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to them that hearken to him; that is, to them that do ſo hear and believe his Goſpel, as to obey it; to them, and no other, he is <hi>the Author of Eternal Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we may the more clearly and diſtinctly underſtand what <hi>Obedience</hi> it is, which the Goſpel exacts as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable Condition of <hi>Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:58790:116"/>
and a neceſſary qualification in all thoſe who hope to be made partakers of it; we may be pleaſed to conſider, that there is a <hi>virtual</hi> and an <hi>actual</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws of God; a <hi>perfect</hi> and a <hi>ſincere</hi> Obedience to them; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of theſe Terms, will give us a diſtinct conception of the thing we are ſpeaking of.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> There is a <hi>virtual,</hi> and there is an <hi>actual</hi> Obedience to the Laws of God. By an <hi>actual</hi> Obedience, I mean the Practice and Exerciſe of the ſeveral Graces and Virtues of Chriſtianity, and the courſe and tenor of a Holy Life; when <hi>out of a good Converſation Men do ſhew forth their Works,</hi> and by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions of their Lives, do give real Teſtimony of their Piety, Juſtice, Sobriety, Humility, Meekneſs, and Charity, and all other Chriſtian Graces and Virtues, as occaſion is miniſtred for the Practiſe and Exerciſe of them.</p>
            <p>By a <hi>virtual</hi> Obedience, I mean a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere belief of the Goſpel, of the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Equity of its Precepts, of the Truth of its Promiſes, and of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of its Threatnings, and a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for all our Sins. This is Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the Root and Principle; for he
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58790:116"/>
who ſincerely believes the Goſpel, and does truly repent of the Errors and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of his Life, is firmly reſolved to obey the Commandments of God, and to walk before him, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all the days of his Life; ſo that there is nothing that prevents or hinders this Man's <hi>actual</hi> Obedience to the Laws of God, in the courſe of a holy and good Life, but only the want of time and opportunity for it. And this was the caſe of thoſe, who, upon the hearing of the Goſpel when it was firſt preached to them, did heartily embrace it, and turn from their Sins, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Idols, to the true and living God, but perhaps were cut off ſoon after; (as there were many, who being but newly gained to Chriſtianity, were preſently put to Death, and ſuffer'd Martyrdom for that Profeſſion;) There is no doubt to be made, but that in this caſe, a <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Obedience was in ſuch Perſons a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient qualification for Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>But where there is time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for the Exerciſe of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and the practice of the virtues of a holy Life, there <hi>actual</hi> Obedience to the Laws and Precepts of the Goſpel, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to qualify us for Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58790:117"/>
ſo that tho' a man do ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, and truly repent of his Sins, and reſolve upon a better Life; yet if he do not afterwards in the courſe of his Life put this reſolution in practice, and <hi>bring forth fruits meet for Repentance, and amendment of Life,</hi> and perſevere in a Holy Courſe, his firſt Reſolution of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, though it were ſincere, will not avail him to Salvation. Nay, if he ſhould continue for ſome time in the Reſolution and Practice of a holy and virtuous Life, and afterwards fall off from it, and <hi>turn from the holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deliver'd unto him, his latter end would be worſe than his beginning; all his righteouſneſs that he hath done would not be remembred; he ſhould die in his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> For <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord. If any man draw back, God's Soul will have no pleaſure in him.</hi> This is ſo very clear and plain from Scripture, that no Man can entertain a contrary perſuaſion, without contradicting the whole tenor of the Bible.</p>
            <p>The Sum of what I have ſaid is this, That a <hi>virtual</hi> Obedience, and <hi>ſincere</hi> Faith and Repentance are ſufficient where there is no time and opportunity for <hi>actual</hi> Obedience and the practice of a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58790:117"/>
holy Life: but where there is opportunity for <hi>actual</hi> Obedience, and the continued practice of a good Life, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance therein; they are indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to our <hi>Eternal Salvation,</hi> and a well grounded hope and aſſurance of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> There is a <hi>perfect,</hi> and there is a <hi>ſincere</hi> Obedience. <hi>Perfect</hi> Obedience conſiſts in the exact Conformity of our hearts and lives to the Law of God, without the leaſt imperfection, and without failing in any point or degree of our Duty. And this Obedience, as it is not conſiſtent with the frailty and infirmity of corrupt Nature, and the imperfection of our preſent State, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth God require it of us as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Condition of Eternal Life. We are indeed commanded to be <hi>perfect, as our Father which is in Heaven is perfect:</hi> But we are not to underſtand this ſtrictly and rigorouſly; for that is not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to Men in this preſent State of Imperfection, but abſolutely impoſſible to Human Nature, for <hi>Men to be perfect, as God is perfect:</hi> but the plain meaning of this Precept is, that we ſhould imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thoſe Divine Perfections of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Mercy, and Patience, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58790:118"/>
and endeavour to be as like God in all theſe as we can, and be ſtill aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after a nearer reſemblance of him, as may be evident to any one who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the connexion and occaſion of theſe words.</p>
            <p>By a <hi>ſincere</hi> Obedience I mean ſuch a conformity of our lives and actions to the Law of God, as to the general courſe and tenor of them, that we do not live in the habitual practice of any known Sin, or in the cuſtomary neglect of any material and conſiderable part of our known Duty; and that we be not wilfully and deliberately guilty of the ſingle act of heinous and notorious Sins, as I have formerly explained this matter more at large, in another Diſcourſe. And this Obedience, even in the beſt of Men, is mixt with great Frailty and Imperfection; but yet becauſe it is the utmoſt that we can do in this State of Infirmity and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the terms of the Goſpel are ſo merciful and gracious, as that God is pleaſed for the ſake of the meritorious Obedience and Sufferings of our Bleſſed Saviour, to accept this <hi>ſincere,</hi> though <hi>imperfect</hi> Obedience, and to reward it with Eternal Life. And this, I doubt
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58790:118"/>
not, after all the intricate diſputes, and infinite Controverſies about this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is the true and clear ſtate of this matter.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>ſincere</hi> Obedience which the Goſpel requires of us, as a Condition of our Happineſs, though it be ſometimes called by Divines, <hi>Evangelical Perfection</hi>; yet it is but very improperly ſo called; for nothing is properly perfect to which any thing is wanting; and great defects and imperfections muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in the Obedience of the beſt and holieſt Men upon Earth; and they who pretend to <hi>Perfection</hi> in this Life, do neither underſtand the Law of God, nor themſelves, but (as St. <hi>John</hi> ſays of ſuch Perſons) <hi>they deceive themſelves, and the truth is not in them</hi>; and beſides other Imperfections, theſe two are evident in them, <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Pride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much may ſuffice to have ſpoken to this <hi>ſecond</hi> Particular, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, What Obedience the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as a Condition, and is pleaſed to accept as a Qualification for Eternal Life.</p>

            <p>FOR the Explication of theſe Words, I propos'd to conſider theſe <hi>Five</hi> Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> How, and by what Means Chriſt is the Author of our Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> What Obedience the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as a Condition, and is pleaſed to accept as a Qualification, in thoſe who hope for eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> The Poſſibility of our perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Condition, by that Grace and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58790:120"/>
Aſſiſtance which is offer'd,<note place="margin">Vol. V.</note> and ready to be afforded to us by the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> The Neceſſity of this Obedience, in order to eternal Life and Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> The Conſiſtency of this method and means of our Salvation with the Law of Faith, and the free Grace and Mercy of God declared in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I have handled the <hi>Two</hi> firſt of theſe, and now proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> Thing I propos'd to conſider, <hi>viz.</hi> The poſſibility of our performing this Condition, by that Grace and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which is offer'd and ready to be afforded to us by the Goſpel. For if Chriſt be <hi>the Author of eternal Salvation</hi> only <hi>to thoſe who obey him</hi>; then thoſe who live in diſobedience to the Goſpel, are in a ſtate of Damnation. But there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the guilt of Diſobedience, where Obedience is impoſſible; no Man being guilty, or juſtly liable to Puniſhment, for the not doing of that, which it was no ways poſſible for him to do. Therefore the Covenant of the Goſpel, into which God is entred with Mankind, doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſe the poſſibility of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Condition of it; otherwiſe it leaves them in as bad a Condition as they were in before, becauſe it only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58790:120"/>
new Bleſſings and Benefits to us,<note place="margin">Ser. 7.</note> but ſets us never the nearer the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, if ſo be the Condition upon which they are granted be altogether impoſſible to us; nay, it renders our ſtate many degrees worſe, if our not performing the Condition of ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Offers bring us under new and greater guilt.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that ſome few Perſons have great Benefit by it, becauſe they by an eſpecial and effectual Grace ſhall be enabled to perform the Conditions of this Covenant; is not this a mighty ſtraitning to the Grace and Mercy of the Goſpel, to confine it within ſo narrow a compaſs, as ſtill to leave the greateſt part of Mankind in a worſe Condition, than if Salvation had never been offer'd to them? As it certainly does, if (as this Doctrine does neceſſarily ſuppoſe) the Guilt and Puniſhment of Men ſhall be greatly increaſed and heightned by their Contempt of, and Diſobedience to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; when at the ſame time it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that it was not poſſible for thoſe Men to obey it, for want of that ſpecial and effectual Grace, which is neceſſary to enable them thereto. I do not love to handle theſe Points contentiouſly, but
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58790:121"/>
this in my Apprehenſion does as much derogate from the Amplitude and Riches of God's Grace in the Goſpel, as any thing that can eaſily be ſaid.</p>
            <p>And therefore, for the right ſtating and clearing of this Matter, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make out theſe <hi>Three</hi> Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we are not ſufficient of our ſelves, and by any power in us, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Condition of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Grace of God is ready to enable and aſſiſt us to the Performance of theſe Conditions, if we be not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That what the Grace of God is ready to enable us to do, if we be not wanting to our ſelves, that may properly be ſaid to be poſſible to us, and, in ſome ſenſe, in our Power.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we are not ſufficient of our ſelves, and by any Power in us, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Condition of the Goſpel. The Grace of God doth clearly appear in the whole buſineſs of our Salvation: <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>and that not of your ſelves, it is the Gift of God.</hi> Faith is the Gift of God, and ſo is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <hi>It is God that works in us both to will and to do of his own goodneſs</hi>; that is, who both inclines and excites us to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58790:121"/>
that which is good, and enables us to do it. <hi>Without me</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>ye can do nothing.</hi> And <hi>through Chriſt ſtrengthning me</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) I am able to do all things</hi>; all things which God requires of us, and expects to be done by us in order to our Salvation. Without the Grace of Chriſt, <hi>we are without ſtrength; and are not ſufficient of our ſelves, as of our ſelves, to think a good thought</hi>; that is, we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign or reſolve upon any thing that is good; <hi>but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Depravation of our Nature hath brought a great Impotency and Diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity upon us to that which is good; and we have made our ſelves much weaker by evil Practice; by the Power of evil Habits, we are enſlaved to our Luſts, and <hi>ſold under Sin.</hi> So that if at any time we are convinced of our Duty, and from that Conviction have an Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that which is good, <hi>evil is preſent to us.</hi> When the Law of God gives us the knowledge of our Duty, and ſtares our Conſciences in the Face, <hi>there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law in our Members, warring againſt the Law of our Minds, and bringing us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in our Members.</hi> Sin brings us under the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58790:122"/>
Power of <hi>Satan,</hi> and gives him domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over us. <hi>For his Servants ye are whom ye obey</hi>; ſo that he rules and bears ſway in us, and <hi>we are led Captive by him at his pleaſure.</hi> Evil and vicious Habits are a kind of ſecond Nature ſuperinduced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, which takes away our Power and Liberty to that which is good, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it impoſſible to us to raiſe and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue our ſelves; ſo that <hi>we are Priſoners and Captives,</hi> 'till <hi>the Son of God ſet us free; and dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins,</hi> 'till <hi>he give us Life.</hi> And therefore the Prophet repreſents the Recovery of our ſelves from the Bondage of Sin, by ſuch things as are naturally impoſſible, to ſhew how great our Weakneſs and Impotency is; Jer. 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian cleanſe his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? Then may ye alſo do good, who are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> And by how much ſtronger the Chains of our Sins are, and the more unable we are to break looſe from them; by ſo much the greater and more evident is the neceſſity of the Divine Aſſiſtance, and of the Power of God's Grace, to knock off thoſe Fetters, and to reſcue us from this Bondage and Slavery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Grace of God is ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and enable us to the Performance of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58790:122"/>
theſe Conditions, that is, to Faith and Repentance, and all the purpoſes of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and a Holy Life; if we be not wanting to our ſelves, and do not reject or neglect to make uſe of that Grace, which God offers us, and is ready to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to us in a very plentiful Manner. And this is that which renders all the Mercies of the Goſpel effectual (if it be not our own Fault, and wilful Neglect) to the great End and Deſign of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and without this, all the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offers of the Goſpel would ſignify nothing at all to our Advantage.</p>
            <p>And this likewiſe is that which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Unbelief and Impenitency and Diſobedience of Men utterly inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; becauſe nothing of all this does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from want of Power, but of Will to do better. And therefore this is ſo neceſſary an Encouragement to all the endeavours of Obedience and a good Life, that Men ſhould be aſſured of God's readineſs to aſſiſt and help them in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their duty, that without this the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Goſpel, though never ſo clear, would ſignify nothing to us, all the Precepts and Directions for a good Life, and the moſt vehement Perſuaſions and Exhortations to Obedience, would have no Force and Life in them; for what
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:58790:123"/>
ſignifies it to direct the dead, and ſpeak to them that cannot hear, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade Men, tho it were with all the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs in the World, to thoſe things which it is impoſſible for them to do?</p>
            <p>Therefore our bleſſed Saviour, when he had laid down, and explained the Precepts of Holineſs and Virtue in his Sermon upon the Mount, to encourage them to what he had been directing and propoſing to them, he aſſures them that God is ready to afford his Grace and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to all thoſe that are ſincerely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to do his Will, and do earneſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his Grace and Aſſiſtance to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Ask</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: For every one that asketh, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; and he that ſeeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened.</hi> So that if any man want the Grace and Aſſiſtance of God's holy Spirit, it is his own fault; it is either for want of ſeeking, or for want of earneſtneſs in asking; for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour expreſly aſſures us, that he denies it to none; <hi>for every one that asketh, receiveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to give us a more lively and ſenſible Aſſurance of this, he repreſents the care and kindneſs of God to Men, by the Affections of earthly Parents to their
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58790:123"/>
Children, who tho they be many times evil themſelves, yet are not wont to deny their Children neceſſary good things, when they decently and dutifully beg them at their hands; <hi>What Man is there of you, whom if his Son ask Bread, will he give him a Stone? Or if he ask a Fiſh, will he give him a Serpent? If ye then being evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how much more ſhall your Father which is in Heaven, give good things to them that ask him?</hi> Here is a general Promiſe and Declaration, that upon our humble and earneſt Prayer to God, he will grant us whatever is good and neceſſary, by which is certainly intended in the firſt place, Spiritual good Things, becauſe theſe are the beſt and moſt neceſſary; and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy us that our Saviour did in the firſt place, and more eſpecially mean theſe, St. <hi>Luke</hi> does particularly inſtance in the Grace and Aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>How much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him? The holy Spirit,</hi> that is, the continual Preſence and Influence of it to all the purpoſes of Guidance and Direction, of Grace and Aſſiſtance, of Comfort and Support in our Chriſtian Courſe.</p>
            <p>And what elſe is the meaning of that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58790:124"/>
Parable of our Saviour's concerning the <hi>Talents</hi> entruſted with every Man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Capacity and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. I ſay, what elſe can be the meaning of it but this? That God is before-hand with every Man, by afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Advantages and Opportunities of being happy, and ſuch a meaſure of Grace and Aſſiſtance to that end, which if he faithfully improve, he ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>into the Joy of his Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon this Conſideration of the gracious Promiſes of the Goſpel to this purpoſe, it is, that the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo earneſtly exhort Chriſtians to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after the higheſt Degree of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Holineſs and Purity, that we are capable of in this Life; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore theſe Promiſes, dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> And ſo likewiſe <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Wherefore, my beloved, work out your own Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> (that is, with great Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, leſt you ſhould fall ſhort of it) <hi>for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi> The Conſideration of God's readineſs to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt us, and of his Grace which is always at hand to ſtir up our Wills to that which
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58790:124"/>
is good, and to ſtrengthen us in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, ought to be a great Argument and Encouragement to us, to put forth our utmoſt Endeavours, and ſo co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the Grace of God toward our own Salvation.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> uſeth the ſame Argument to preſs Men to uſe their utmoſt <hi>Diligence, to make their calling and election ſure,</hi> by abounding in all the Virtues of a good Life; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>According as his Divine Power hath given us all things which pertain to Life and Godlineſs,</hi> (that is, hath ſo plentifully furniſht us with all the requiſites to a godly Life) <hi>through the knowledge of him that hath called us to Glory and Virtue</hi> (that is, by knowledge of the Goſpel and the Grace therein offered to us) <hi>whereby he hath given unto us exceeding great and precious Promiſes, that by theſe ye might be Partakers of a Divine Nature, having eſcaped the Corruption that is in the World through Luſt.</hi> And then from the conſideration of this Divine Power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us by the Goſpel, and the Promiſes of it, he exhorts Men <hi>to give all diligence, to add to their Faith Virtue, and Knowledge, and Temperance, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Godlineſs, and brotherly Love, and Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:58790:125"/>And indeed the Scripture every where aſcribes our Regeneration and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Beginning, and Progreſs, and Perſeverance of our Obedience, to the powerful Grace and Aſſiſtance of God's holy Spirit; we are ſaid to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and born again of the Spirit, to be renewed and ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, to be led by the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>by the Spirit to mortifie the deeds of the Fleſh,</hi> and in a word, <hi>to be kept by the mighty Power of God through Faith unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. What the Grace of God is ready to enable us to do, if we be not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Selves, may properly be ſaid to be poſſible to us, and in ſome ſenſe, in our Power. That may be ſaid to be poſſible to us, which tho' we <hi>cannot do of our ſelves, as of our ſelves,</hi> (that is by our own Natural Power) yet we can do by the Help and Aſſiſtance of another, if that Aſſiſtance be ready to be afforded to us; as we are ſure the Grace of God's Holy Spirit is, becauſe he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to them that ſeek it, and <hi>he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful who hath promiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That cannot be ſaid to be wholly out of a Man's Power, which he may have for asking; that which we are able to do by the Strength and Aſſiſtance of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58790:125"/>
another, is not impoſſible to us. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly St. <hi>Paul</hi> did no ways derogate from the Grace of God when he ſaid, <hi>I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do all things thro' Chriſt ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me</hi>; he reckons himſelf able to do all that which by the ſtrength of Chriſt he was enabled to do.</p>
            <p>And this is the true Ground of all the Perſwaſions and Exhortations, which we meet with in Scripture, to Holineſs and Obedience, which would all be, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to no purpoſe, but very unreaſonable, if we were wholly deſtitute of Power to do what God commands: but if he be always ready at hand to aſſiſt us by a Grace ſufficient for us, if he co-operate with us in the Work of our Salvation, then is there abundant ground of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to our Endeavours; and if we fall ſhort of eternal Salvation, it is wholly our own fault; it is not becauſe God is wanting to us in thoſe Aids and Aſſiſtances of his Grace which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but becauſe we are wanting to our ſelves, in not ſeeking God's Grace more earneſtly, or by neglecting to make uſe of it when it is afforded to us. For it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all one, both to the encouragement of our Endeavours, and to the rendring of our Diſobedience inexcuſable, whether
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58790:126"/>
we be able of our ſelves to perform the Condition of the Goſpel, or God be ready to aſſiſt us by his Grace and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, and make ſtrait paths for your feet, leſt that which is Lame be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed. Follow holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord; looking diligently leſt any man fail of the Grace of God</hi>; intimating, that it is want of care and diligence on our part, if the Grace of God fail of its end, and be not effectual to all the purpoſes of Faith, and Repentance, and Obedience. God does not with-hold his Grace from us: but Men may receive it in vain, if they do not make uſe of it. And thus I have done with the <hi>third</hi> thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſider from theſe words. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth,. viz.</hi> To conſider the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of this Obedience, in order to our obtaining of Eternal Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Chriſt is the Author of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to them that obey him</hi>; that is, to ſuch, and only to ſuch, as live in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Precepts of his holy Goſpel,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:58790:126"/>
to them who frame the general courſe of their lives according to his Laws. Some Men ſeem to be ſo afraid of the Merit of Obedience and good Works, that they are loth to aſſert the Neeeſſity of them, and do it with ſo much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if they were not throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of it, or did apprehend ſome dangerous conſequence of it: but this fear is perfectly groundleſs; as if Merit could not be excluded, without caſting off our Duty, and releaſing our ſelves from any Neceſſary Obligation to be good. For any Man ſurely may eaſily diſcern a plain difference between a worthineſs of deſert, and a fitneſs of receiving a Rebel, being penitent and ſorry for what he hath done; though he cannot deſerve a pardon, yet he may thereby be qualified and made meet to receive it; though Repentance do not make him worthy, yet it may make him capable of it, which an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Rebel, and one that perſiſts in his diſloyalty, is not. This is a thing ſo plain of it ſelf, that it would be waſte of time and words to inſiſt longer upon the proof of it.</p>
            <p>Now the Neceſſity of Obedience, in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58790:127"/>
order to eternal Life and Happineſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon theſe <hi>three</hi> grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> Upon the Conſtitution and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The general Reaſon of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Upon the particular Nature of that Reward, which God will confer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us for our Obedience.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> The Conſtitution and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. <hi>Eternal Life is the Gift of God</hi>; and he may do what he will with his own, he may diſpenſe his Gifts and Favours upon what Terms and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he pleaſeth; and therefore if he hath plainly declared, that <hi>to them who by patient continuance in well-doing ſeek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, he will give eternal Life</hi>; that <hi>without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, no Man ſhall ſee the Lord</hi>; but <hi>if we have our fruit unto holineſs, our End ſhall be everlaſting Life</hi>; who ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his Will, or diſpute his Pleaſure? The Right and Authority of God in this matter is ſo unqueſtionable, that it admits of no conteſt; and the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Benefits propos'd, are ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely great and unvaluable, that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of obtaining them, which is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be perform'd by us, can be
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58790:127"/>
thought hard and unequal; ſo that we ought thankfully to receive ſo great a favour, let the terms and conditions of it be what they will; and if there were no other reaſon for the impoſing of theſe Conditions upon us, of Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Obedience, but merely the Will and Pleaſure of God, this were enough to ſilence all Objections againſt it.</p>
            <p>But 2<hi>dly,</hi> The Neceſſity of Obedience, in order to eternal Life, is likewiſe found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Reaſon of Rewards in general. For though the meaſure and degree of our Reward, ſo infinitely beyond the proportion of our beſt Duty and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as eternal Life and Happineſs is, I ſay though the meaſure and degree of this Reward be founded in the immenſe Bounty and Goodneſs of God; yet the Reaſon of Reward in general, is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily founded in our Obedience to God's Laws; for according to the true nature and reaſon of things, nothing but Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is capable of Reward. For though Authority may pardon the breach and tranſgreſſion of Laws, and remit the puniſhment due thereto; yet to reward the contempt of Laws, and wilful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to them, is directly contrary
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58790:128"/>
to the deſign of Government, and does plainly overthrow the very Reaſon and End of all Laws, and makes Obedience and Diſobedience to be all one, if ſo be they are equally capable of Reward; and therefore nothing can be more abſurd and ſenſleſs, than for any Man to hope to be rewarded by God, who does not live in a ſincere Obedience to his Laws. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man that hath this hope in him,</hi> (that is, in Chriſt Jeſus, to be ſav'd by him) <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth himſelf, even as he is pure</hi>; that is, endeavours to be like him in the purity and obedience of his life; and nothing ſurely can be more unreaſonable, than to expect to be rewarded by the great Governour and Judge of the World, if we be diſobedient to his Laws; for where Obedience to Law is refuſed, there all reaſon and equity of Reward ceaſeth. No wiſe Prince can think fit to reward Diſloyalty and Contempt of his Laws; becauſe to reward it, would be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it; much leſs will God, the great and infinitely wiſe Governour of the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> the Neceſſity of Obedience will yet more evidently appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the particular Nature of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which God will confer upon us
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:58790:128"/>
for our Obedience. The happineſs of Heaven, which is the Reward promiſed in the Goſpel, is deſcribed to us by the ſight and enjoyment of God. Now to render us capable of this bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it is neceſſary that we be like God; but nothing but Obedience and Holineſs, and <hi>being renewed after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of him who created us in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> can make us like to God. For he that would be like God muſt be holy, and juſt, and good, and patient, and merciful, as God is; and this alone can make us capable of the bleſſed ſight and enjoyment of God; for unleſs <hi>we be like him,</hi> we cannot <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> and if we ſhould be admitted into Heaven, we could not find any pleaſure and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in communion with him. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>for they ſhall ſee God. Without Holineſs</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> And indeed, it is in the very nature of the thing impoſſible, that a wicked Man (whilſt he remains ſo) ſhould ever be happy, becauſe there can be no agreeable and delightful Society between thoſe that are of a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary temper and diſpoſition to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, between him <hi>who is of purer eyes
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58790:129"/>
than to behold iniquity,</hi> and a ſinful and impure Creature. For <hi>what fellowſhip</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>can righteouſneſs have with unrighteouſneſs? what communion hath light with darkneſs, or God with Belial?</hi> that is, with the wicked and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Till we become like to God in the frame and temper of our minds, there can be no happy Society between him and us; we could neither delight our ſelves in God, nor he take any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in us; for <hi>he is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with him. The wicked ſhall not ſtand in his ſight, he hateth all the workers of iniquity.</hi> It cannot be otherwiſe, but that there muſt be an eternal jarring and diſcord between the righteous and holy God, and wicked and unrighteous Men. <hi>I will behold thy face</hi> (ſays <hi>David) in righteouſneſs.</hi> There is no looking God in the face, upon any other terms. If we have been <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> God will caſt us out of his ſight, and in great anger bid us to <hi>depart from him</hi>; and we alſo ſhall deſire him to <hi>depart from us,</hi> as being unable to bear the ſight of him.</p>
            <p>So that there is great reaſon why Holineſs and Obedience ſhould be made the Conditions of Eternal Life and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:58790:129"/>
ſince in the very Nature of the thing it is ſo neceſſary a Qualification for the bleſſed ſight and enjoyment of God, who is the Cauſe and Fountain of Happineſs. I come in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth</hi> and laſt place, To ſhew that this Method and Means of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is no prejudice to the Law of Faith, and to the free Grace and Mercy of God declared in the Goſpel. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is called <hi>the Law of Faith,</hi> and <hi>the Law of Grace,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation, which is called <hi>the Law,</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted ſo much in external Rites and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances, which were but <hi>types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of good things to come,</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls them in this Epiſtle;) and which when they were come, that Law did expire of it ſelf, and was out of date, the obligation and obſervance of it was no longer neceſſary; but <hi>a better Covenant,</hi> which was <hi>eſtabliſh'd upon better Promiſes,</hi> came in the place of it, and Men were <hi>juſtified by Faith,</hi> that is, by ſincerely embracing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and were no longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an obligation to that external, and ſervile, and imperfect Diſpenſation, which conſiſted in Circumciſion, and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:58790:130"/>
in almoſt an endleſs number of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ceremonies. Theſe are <hi>the works of the Law</hi> ſo often ſpoken of by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning which, the <hi>Jews</hi> had not only an opinion of the neceſſity of them, to a Man's Juſtification and Salvation, but likewiſe of the Merit of them; in oppoſition to both which opinions, St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Covenant of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>the Law of Faith,</hi> and <hi>the Law of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is no where the leaſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given, either by our Saviour, or his Apoſtles, that Obedience to the Precepts of the Goſpel (which are in ſubſtance the Moral Law cleared and perfected) is not neceſſary to our acceptance with God, and the obtaining of Eternal Life; but on the contrary, 'tis our Saviour's expreſs Direction to the young Man, who ask'd, <hi>what good thing he ſhould do, that he might obtain Eternal Life? If thou wilt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>enter into Life, keep the Commandments</hi>; and that he might underſtand what Commandments he meant, he inſtanceth in the Precepts of the Moral Law. And indeed, the whole tenour of our Saviour's Sermons, and the Precepts and Writings of the Apoſtles, are full and expreſs to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58790:130"/>
               <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven. Whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine</hi> (that is, theſe Precepts which I have delivered) <hi>and doth them not, I will liken him to a fooliſh man, who built his houſe upon the ſand, and the rain deſcended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. If ye know theſe things, happy are ye, if ye do them. In every Nation, he that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of him. In Jeſus Chriſt neither Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion; but Faith, that is acted and inſpired by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And that the Apoſtle here means, <hi>that Charity</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> which is <hi>the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> is evident from what he ſays elſewhere; <hi>that neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; but the keeping of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God</hi>; In which Text it is plain, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the terms of our Juſtification, and what is available with God to that purpoſe. And St. <hi>James</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, tells us, that <hi>by</hi> the <hi>works</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:58790:131"/>
of <hi>Obedience our Faith is made perfect,</hi> and that <hi>Faith without Works is dead</hi>; and ſurely a dead Faith will neither juſtifie nor ſave any Man. St. <hi>John</hi> likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earneſtly cautions us to take heed of any ſuch Doctrine, as would take away the neceſſity of Righteouſneſs and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; <hi>Little Children</hi> (ſays he) <hi>let no man deceive you, he that doth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is righteous, as he is righteous.</hi> To all which, I ſhall only add the plain words of my Text, that <hi>Chriſt became the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of eternal Salvation to them that obey him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that no Man hath reaſon to fear, that this Doctrine of the neceſſity of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to our Acceptance with God, and the obtaining of eternal life, ſhould be any ways prejudicial to the Law of Faith, and the Law of Grace. For ſo long as theſe <hi>three</hi> things are but aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſecured,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> That Faith is the Root and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Obedience and a holy Life, and that <hi>without it, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That we ſtand continually in need of the Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance, to enable us to perform that Obedience which the Goſpel requires of us, and is pleaſed to accept in order to eternal life. And,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:58790:131"/>3<hi>dly,</hi> That the forgiveneſs of our Sins, and the Reward of eternal Life, are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the free Grace and Mercy of God, conferring theſe Bleſſings upon us, not for the merit of our Obedience, but only for the merit and ſatisfaction of the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Sufferings of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Redeemer; I ſay, ſo long as we aſſert theſe <hi>three</hi> things, we give all that the Goſpel any where aſcribes to Faith, and to the Grace of God revealed in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I have been careful to expreſs theſe things more fully and diſtinctly, that no Man may imagine, that whilſt we aſſert the Neceſſity of Obedience and a Holy Life, we have any deſign to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in the leaſt from the Faith and the Grace of God; but only to engage and encourage Men to Holineſs and a good Life, by convincing them of the abſolute and indiſpenſable neceſſity of it, in order to eternal Salvation. For all that I have ſaid, is in plain Engliſh no more but this, That it is neceſſary for a Man to be a good Man, that he may get to Heaven; and whoever finds fault with this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, finds fault with the Goſpel it ſelf, and the main end and deſign of the Grace of God therein revealed to Mankind,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58790:132"/>
which offers Salvation to Men upon no other terms than theſe which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and to preach and preſs this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is certainly, if any thing in the World can be ſo, to purſue the great End and Deſign of the Chriſtian Religion, ſo plainly and expreſly declared by St. <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſalvation, hath appear'd to all men, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World.</hi> And if the Grace of God declared in the Goſpel, have this effect upon us, then we may with Confidence <hi>wait for the bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar People zealous of good works</hi>; and then he adds, <hi>theſe things teach, and exhort, and rebuke with all Authority</hi>; that is, declare and inculcate this doctrine, and rebuke ſeverely thoſe who teach or practiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. And he repeats it again with a more vehement Charge to <hi>Titus,</hi> to preſs upon Men the neceſſity of Obedience and good Works, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.8. <hi>This is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying, and theſe things I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that they who have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58790:132"/>
in God, be careful to maintain good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that now remains, is to make ſome uſeful Inferences from what hath been ſaid upon this Argument, and ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, To convince us that an empty Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, how ſpecious and glorious ſoever it be, if it be deſtitute of the fruits of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and a holy Life, will by no means avail to bring us to Heaven. No profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, no Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him, tho' we be baptized in his Name, and liſt our ſelves in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Diſciples and Followers, tho' we have made a conſtant Profeſſion of all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and have performed all the external parts and duties of Religion, have gone conſtantly to Church, and frequented the Service of God, and have joined in publick Prayers to God with great appearance of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have heard his Word with great Reverence and Attention, and received the bleſſed Sacrament with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expreſſions of Love and Gratitude to our beleſſed Redeemer; nay tho' we had <hi>heard</hi> our bleſſed Saviour himſelf <hi>teach in our ſtreets,</hi> and <hi>had eaten and drunken in his preſence</hi>; yet if all this while <hi>we have not
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58790:133"/>
done the will of God,</hi> and obeyed his Laws, none of all theſe things will ſignifie any thing to bring us to Heaven, and make us Partakers of that Salvation, which he hath purchaſed for Mankind.</p>
            <p>But we cannot plead ſo much for our ſelves, as thoſe did, of whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeaks. None of us ſhall be able to alledge for our ſelves at the great day, that <hi>we had propheſied in his Name, and in his name had caſt out Devils, and in his name had done many wonderful Works</hi>; and yet if we could alledge all this, it would do us no good. All that ſuch can ſay for themſelves is, that <hi>they have call'd him Lord, Lord,</hi> that is, they have made profeſſion of his Religion, and been call'd by his Name, that they have paid an outward Honour and reſpect to him, and declared a mighty Love and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for him; but <hi>they have not done his will,</hi> but <hi>have hated to be reformed, and have caſt his Commandments behind their backs,</hi> they have only born the Leaves of an outward Profeſſion, but <hi>have brought forth no fruit unto Holineſs,</hi> and therefore can have no reaſonable expectation, that <hi>their End ſhould be everlaſting Life.</hi> So that when theſe Men ſhall appear before the great and terrible Judge of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58790:133"/>
World, they ſhall have nothing to ſay, but thoſe vain Words, <hi>Lord, Lord</hi>; to which our Saviour will anſwer in that Day, <hi>why call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye would not do the things which I ſaid</hi>? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all your profeſſion of Faith in me, and ſubjection to me, <hi>ye have been workers of Iniquity, therefore depart from me, I know ye not whence ye are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The conſideration of what hath been ſaid ſhould ſtir as up to a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgement of what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our Salvation hath done for us; and there is great reaſon for thankfulneſs, whether we conſider the greatneſs of the Benefit conferred upon us, or the way and manner in which it was purchaſed, or the eaſie and reaſonable terms upon which it may be obtained.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> If we conſider the greatneſs of the Benefit conferred upon us, and that is Salvation, <hi>eternal Salvation,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends in it all the Bleſſings and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the Goſpel, both the Means and the End, our Happineſs, and the Way to it, by <hi>ſaving us from our Sins</hi>; from the guilt of them, by our Juſtification in the Blood of Chriſt; and from the Power and Dominion of them, by the ſanctifying grace and virtue of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:58790:134"/>And it comprehends the End, our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from Hell and the Wrath to come, and the beſtowing of Happineſs upon us, a great and laſting Happineſs, great as our Wiſhes, and Immortal as our Souls; all this is comprehended in <hi>eternal Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> If we conſider the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which this great Benefit was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and procured for us; in a way of infinite Kindneſs and Condeſcenſion, in the loweſt Humiliation, and the unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Sufferings of the Son of God; for <hi>never was there any ſorrow like unto his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, wherewith the Lord afflicted him in the day of his fierce Anger</hi>; in his <hi>taking upon him the form of a Servant,</hi> and the perſon of a Sinner, and his <hi>becoming obedient to death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> which was the Puniſhment of the vileſt Slaves, and the moſt hainous Malefactors. The Son of God came down from Heaven, from the higheſt pitch of Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, into this lower World, this <hi>Vale of Tears,</hi> and ſink of Sin and Sorrow; and was contented himſelf to ſuffer, to ſave us from eternal Ruin; to be the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable, and the moſt miſerable Man that ever was, that he might raiſe us to Glory and Honour, and advance us to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58790:134"/>
a ſtate of the greateſt Happineſs that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature is capable of.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> If we conſider the eaſie and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Terms upon which we may be made Partakers of this unſpeakable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and that is by a conſtant and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and univerſal Obedience to the Laws of God, which ſuppoſeth Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the Root and Principle of all the Virtues of a good Life; that is, by doing that which beſt becomes us, and which is moſt agreeable to the original Frame of our Nature, and to the dictates of our Reaſon, and which ſetting aſide the conſideration of the Reward, is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſt for our preſent Benefit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, our Comfort and Happineſs, even in this World; for God, in giving Laws to us, hath impoſed nothing upon us, but what in all reaſon ought to have been our choice, if he had not impoſed it; nothing but what is for our good, and is in its own nature neceſſary to make us capable of that Happineſs which he hath promiſed to us. And what can be more gracious, than to make one Benefit the Condition of a greater? Than to promiſe to make us happy for ever, if we will but do that which upon all accounts is really beſt and moſt for our Advantage in this preſent Life?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:58790:135"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here is abundant Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to our Obedience; we have the divine Aſſiſtance promiſed to us, to enable us to the performance of the moſt difficult parts of our Duty; we have the holy Spirit of God to help our Infirmities, to excite us to that which is good, and to help and ſtrengthen us in the doing of it.</p>
            <p>For our further Encouragement we are aſſured of the divine Acceptance in caſe of our ſincere Obedience, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the manifold Failings and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of it, for the ſake of the perfect Righteouſneſs and Obedience, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Sufferings of our bleſſed Saviour: and tho <hi>when we have done all that we can do we are unprofitable Servants,</hi> and have done nothing but what was our duty, yet God is pleaſed to accept what we can do, becauſe it is ſincere, and to forgive the defects and imperfections of our Obedience, for his ſake, who <hi>fulfilled all righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides all this, we have the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of a great and everlaſting Reward, infinitely beyond all proportion of any ſervice and Obedience that we can perform. And if God be ready to aſſiſt and ſtrengthen us in the doing of our duty, and be willing ſo graciouſly to accept and to reward at ſuch a rate the Sincerity of our endeavours to pleaſe him,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58790:135"/>
notwithſtanding all the failings and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of our beſt ſervice and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; what can we poſſibly deſire more for our encouragement, to <hi>patient continuance in well-doing,</hi> and to be <hi>ſtedfaſt and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and abundant in the work of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> The conſideration of what hath been ſaid upon this Argument may ſerve ſeverely to rebuke the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Preſumption of thoſe, who rely with ſo much confidence upon Chrſt for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, without any conſcience or care to keep his Commandments; as if Salvation lay upon his Hands, and he knew not how to diſpoſe of it, and were glad of any one that would come and take it off upon any terms. No, <hi>he came to ſave us from our Sins, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purifie to himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people zealous of good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Salvation which he hath purchaſed for us, doth neceſſarily imply our forſaking of our Sins, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God and our Duty; and his Death and Sufferings are not more an argument of his great Love to Mankind, than they are a demonſtration of his perfect hatred of Sin. So that if we continue in the Love and practice of Sin, we defeat the whole deſign of his coming into the World, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58790:136"/>
of all that he hath done and ſuffered for us; and the redemption which Chriſt hath wrought for us will not avail us in the leaſt. <hi>Salvation is far from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> (ſays <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.155.) If we have been <hi>workers of Iniquity,</hi> the Saviour of the World when he comes to judge it, will bid us <hi>to depart from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all that hath been ſaid, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that it is the greateſt Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World, for any Man to hope to obtain eternal Salvation by any device whatſoever, or in the Communion of any Church whatſoever, without Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and a holy Life. For tho' our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience cannot merit; yet it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to qualifie and diſpoſe us for it: tho' it does not make us ſtrictly worthy; yet it makes us <hi>meet to be made partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi>

               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:58790:137"/>II. Here is the Commiſſion he gave to his Apoſtles, by virtue of this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations.</hi> The Commiſſion which he here gives, is founded in the Authority he had before received. Having all Power committed to him, he conſtitutes and appoints the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Affairs of this his ſpiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon Earth; and this ſeems to be the ſame Commiſſion, which St. <hi>John</hi> mentions in other words, <hi>John</hi> 20.21. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you</hi>; that is, as my Father commiſſion'd me before, ſo now having received full Authority from him, I commiſſion you.</p>

plainly enough given them, to preach the Goſpel to the Gentiles, as well as to the Jews. Which will more fully appear, if we compare this paſſage in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> with the other Evangeliſts. St. <hi>Mark, oh.</hi> 16.15. hath it; <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature.</hi> From which Text I ſuppoſe St. <hi>Francis</hi> thought himſelf bound to preach to Beaſts and Birds, and accordingly did it very often, and with wonderful ſucceſs, as they tell us in the Legend of his Life. But to extend our Saviour's Commiſſion ſo far, is want of Common ſenſe; in which St. <hi>Francis</hi> (tho' they tell us he had other Gifts and Graces to an eminent degree) was plainly defective.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, St. <hi>Luke, ch.</hi> 24.47. tells us, our Saviour commanded, that <hi>Repentance and remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Jeruſalem.</hi> So that their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion did plainly extend to the Gentiles, as well as to the Jews; only they were to begin with the Jews, and to preach the Goſpel firſt to them, and when they had gone over <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> then to paſs to other Nations, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> doth moſt expreſly declare, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ye ſhall receive power; after that the holy Ghoſt
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:58790:138"/>
is come upon you, and ye ſhall be witneſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, both in Jeruſalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermoſt parts of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſee the ſtrange power of Prejudice, to blind the Eyes even of good Men, in the plaineſt matters. The Diſciples of our Saviour, for all they had entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a new Religion, yet they retained the old Pride and Prejudice of their Nation, againſt the reſt of the World; as if none but themſelves had any ſhare in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, or were to have any part in the Salvation of the Meſſias.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour did ſo far conſider this Prejudice of theirs, that he never in his life time acquainted them with this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo as to make them fully to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, becauſe they were not able to bear it. And it is very probable, that this is one of thoſe things which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour meant, <hi>John</hi> 16.12, 13. <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you; but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.</hi> That is, he ſhould lead them into the knowledge of thoſe Truths, of which they were not then capable. And tho' our Saviour, after his Reſurrection, ſeems to have declared this ſufficiently to them;

yet by their practice after his Aſcenſion, it appears that they underſtood all this only of the <hi>Jews,</hi> namely that they were to preach the Goſpel firſt to the <hi>Jews</hi> that were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in <hi>Judea,</hi> and then to thoſe that were diſperſed in other Nations; for 'tis clear from the Hiſtory of their firſt Preaching, recorded in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that they preached to none but to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Proſelytes of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion. So ſtrong was their Prejudice, that they had not the leaſt ſuſpicion that this Bleſſing of the Goſpel was intended for the Heathen World; nor were they convinced to the contray, 'till St. <hi>Peter</hi> had a ſpecial Viſion and Revelation to this purpoſe, and the Holy Ghoſt came upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gifts, as he had done before upon the <hi>Jews</hi> that were converted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. And thus the Spirit of God <hi>led them into</hi> this <hi>Truth,</hi> and then they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this Command of our Saviour's in a larger Senſe. And to this St. <hi>Peter</hi> plainly refers, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. where he tells us, how that Chriſt after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appeared to them, and <hi>commanded them to preach unto the People.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe do <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 13.46. where they ſpeak thus to the <hi>Jews, It was
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:58790:139"/>
neceſſary that the word ſhould firſt be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, but ſeeing you put it from you, lo we turn to the Gentiles, for ſo hath the Lord commanded us.</hi> Now he no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded this, but in this Commiſſion, which he gave them before his Aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have here a particular declaration how they were to manage this work of making Diſciples to the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By baptizing them into the Chrſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By inſtructing them in the Precepts and Practices of a Chriſtian Life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By baptizing them into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, which is here call'd <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Baptiſm is a ſolemn Rite appointed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for the initiating of Perſons into the Chriſtian Religion: But it was a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in uſe before, both among the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The Heathen obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it at the initiating Perſons into their Religious Myſteries; and the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they admitted Proſelytes to their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; at which time the Males (as <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> tells us) were both circumciſed and baptized, the Women were only bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. One Circumſtance of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:58790:140"/>
of grown Perſons was, that ſtanding in the Water up to the Neck, they reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeveral Precepts of the Law. And as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers further tell us, this Ceremony did not only belong to them that were of grown Years, but to the Children of Proſelytes, if it were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, upon condition, that when they came to Years they ſhould continue in that Religion.</p>
            <p>Now tho' this was a religious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny uſed both by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and without any Divine Inſtitution, that we know of, our bleſſed Saviour (who in none of his Inſtitutions ſeems to have favour'd unneceſſary Innovations) was ſo far from the ſuperſtition of declining it upon this account, that it had been in religious uſe both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that he ſeems the rather to have choſen it for that very reaſon. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was a common Rite of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in it ſelf very ſignificant of that Purity which is the great deſign of all Religion, it was the more likely to find the eaſier Acceptance, and to be moſt ſuitable to <hi>that,</hi> which he intended to be <hi>the univerſal Religion</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p>As for the form of Baptiſm, <hi>into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:58790:140"/>
Holy Ghoſt,</hi> it plainly refers to that ſhort Creed, or Profeſſion of Faith, which was required of thoſe that were to be baptized, anſwerable to the reciting of the Precepts of the Law, at the baptizing of Proſelytes among the <hi>Jews</hi>; now the Articles of this Creed were reduced to theſe three Heads, <hi>of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and contains what was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed concerning each of theſe. And this probably is that which the Apoſtle calls the Doctrine of Baptiſm, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. <hi>viz.</hi> a ſhort Summary of the Chriſtian Faith, the Profeſſion whereof was to be made at Baptiſm; of which the moſt ancient Fathers make ſo frequent mention, calling it <hi>the rule of Faith.</hi> It was a great while indeed before Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans tied themſelves ſtrictly to that very form of Words, which we now call the Apoſtles Creed, but the Senſe was the ſame, tho every one expreſt it in his own Words; nay the ſame Father reciting it upon ſeveral Occaſions, does not confine himſelf to the very ſame Expreſſions: A plain indication that they were not then ſtrictly bound up to any form of Words, but retaining the ſenſe and ſubſtance of the Articles, every one expreſt them as he pleaſed. So that <hi>to baptize in the name
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:58790:141"/>
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is to perform this Rite or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by the Authority of, and with ſpecial Relation to the three Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as the chief Objects of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, whereof ſolemn Profeſſion was then made. So that upon this form in Baptiſm appointed by our Saviour, compared with what is elſewhere ſaid in Scripture, concerning the Divinity of the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally founded the Doctrine of the bleſſed Trinity, I mean in that ſimplicity in which the Scripture hath delivered it, and not as it hath been ſince confounded and entangled in the Cobwebs and Niceties of the Schools. The Scripture indeed no where calls them Perſons, but ſpeaks of them as we do of ſeveral Perſons, and therefore that word is not unfitly uſed to expreſs the difference between them, or at leaſt we do not know a fitter word for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>By <hi>baptizing</hi> then <hi>in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is meant, the initiating of Men by this ſolemn Rite or Ceremony into the Chriſtian Religion, upon their profeſſion of the neceſſary Doctrines of it, concerning <hi>the Father,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:58790:141"/>
Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and a ſolemn Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Engagement to live according to thoſe Doctrines: Which promiſe of a ſuitable Life and Practice was likewiſe made at the ſame time, as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and other of the ancient Fathers do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify.</p>
            <p>But before I leave this Head, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit to take particular notice what uſe the Anabaptiſts make of this Text, ſo as in effect to lay the whole ſtreſs of their Cauſe upon it; as if by virtue of this Command of our Saviour's, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wherein it is expreſt, all Infants, even thoſe of Chriſtian Parents, who are themſelves already admitted into the new Covenant of the Goſpel, were excluded from Baptiſm; becauſe it is here ſaid by our Saviour, <hi>Go ye, and diſciple all Nations, baptizing them</hi>; from whence they infer, (and very clearly and ſtrongly as they think) that none are to be baptized, but ſuch as are firſt throughly inſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion, and made Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which Infants are not, but only thoſe who are grown to ſome Maturity of Years and Underſtanding: But the Opinion and Practice of the ancient Church in this matter, is a ſufficient Bar to this Inference, at leaſt to the clearneſs
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:58790:142"/>
of it. And indeed it cannot reaſonably be imagined, that the Apoſtles, who had all of them been bred up in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, which conſtantly, and by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a divine Precept and Inſtitution, admitted Infants into that Church, and to the benefits of that Covenant, by the Rite of Circumciſion, and likewiſe the Infants of Proſelytes by Baptiſm, (as I obſerved before) I ſay no Man can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably imagine, that the Apoſtles could underſtand our Saviour, as intending by any conſequence from this Text, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Children of Chriſtians out of the Chriſtian Church, and to debar them of the benefits of the New Covenant of the Goſpel: The Children of Chriſtians being every whit as capable of being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into this new Covenant, and of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Benefits of it, as Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> were of being admitted into the old: Unleſs we will ſuppoſe (which at firſt ſight ſeems very harſh and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable) that by the terms of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, Children are in a much worſe condition, than the Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the Law. So that the pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reaſon being ſo plain, nothing leſs than an expreſs Prohibition from our Saviour, and an exception of Children
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58790:142"/>
from Baptiſm, can be thought ſufficient to deprive the Children of Chriſtians of any Privilege, of which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> were capable. For the plain meaning of this Commiſſion to the Apoſtles is, to go and <hi>proſelyte all Nations to the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and to admit them ſolemnly into it by Baptiſm, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to proſelyte Men to their Religion by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and Baptiſm; by which Rites alſo they took in the Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, upon promiſe that when they came to Years they ſhould continue in that Religion. And if this was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's meaning, the Apoſtles had no reaſon, from the Tenor of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to underſtand that the Children of Chriſtian Proſelytes were any more excluded, than the Children of Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, unleſs our Saviour had expreſly excepted them; for it is a favourable Caſe, and in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Privilege, and therefore ought not to be determined to debar Children of it, upon any obſcure conſequence from a Text, which it is certain was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo underſtood by the Chriſtian Church, for 1500 Years together. I have done with the <hi>firſt</hi> part of their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was to diſciple or proſelyte
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:58790:143"/>
all Nations to the Chriſtian Religion, and to admit them into the Chriſtian Church, by the Rite or Sacrament of Baptiſm. I proceed to conſider the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> part of their Commiſſion, which was to inſtruct Men in the Precepts and Duties of a Chriſtian Life, <hi>teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you.</hi> You ſee how their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion bounds and limits them, they were to teach others thoſe Precepts which Chriſt had taught and deliver'd to them; they had no Power by virtue of this Commiſſion to make new Laws, which ſhould be of univerſal and perpetual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and conſequently neceſſary to the Salvation of all Chriſtians; they were only to be the Publiſhers, but not the Authors of this new Religion. And therefore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when the <hi>Corinthians</hi> conſulted him about ſeveral things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Marriage and Virginity, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives his advice, but would not take upon him to make a Law in thoſe caſes that ſhould be binding to all Chriſtians. And for the ſame Reaſon Chriſtians do generally at this day, think themſelves abſolved from the Obligation of that Canon, which was made even in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Apoſtles, as to all thoſe Branches
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:58790:143"/>
of it, the reaſon whereof is now c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But notwithſtanding this, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which our Saviour conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Apoſtles to teach his Doctrine, does in the nature of it neceſſarily imply a Power of governing the Societies of Chriſtians, under ſuch Officers, and by ſuch Rules, as are moſt ſuitable to the nature of ſuch a Society, and moſt fit to promote the great Ends of the Chriſtian Religion: For without this power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, they cannot be ſuppos'd to be endowed with ſufficient Authority to teach; and therefore in purſuance of this Commiſſion, we find that the Apoſtles did govern the Societies of Chriſtians by ſuch Rules and Conſtitutions, as were fitted to the then preſent circumſtances of Chriſtianity. And as they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point temporary Officers upon emergent Occaſions, ſo they conſtituted others that were of perpetual uſe in the Church, for the inſtructing and governing of Chriſtians, and that in ſuch a ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one another, as would be moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to the attaining of the end of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; which ſubordination of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, hath not only been uſed in all Religions, but in all the well regulated Civil Societies that ever were in the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:58790:144"/>
World. And this may ſuffice to have ſpoken of the ſecond part of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> thing in the Text, is the Promiſe which our Saviour here makes for the encouragement of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in this Work; <hi>Lo, I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, even unto the end of the world</hi>; that is, tho' I be going from you in perſon, yet I will ſtill be preſent with you by my Power and Spirit. And ſurely this muſt needs be a great Encouragement to have him engaged for their Aſſiſtance <hi>who had all power in heaven and earth committed to him,</hi> as he tells them at the 18<hi>th. verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour therefore, as far as the time will permit, to explain to you the true meaning and extent of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. That it is primarily made to the Apoſtles, no man can doubt, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that it was ſpoken to them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by our Saviour; and in regard to them, the meaning of it is plainly this, that our Saviour would ſend down the Holy Ghoſt upon them, in miraculous Gifts, to quality and enable them for the more ſpeedy planting and propagating of the Goſpel in the World, and that he would be with them, and aſſiſt them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily in this Work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:58790:144"/>And that this is the primary mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, in regard to the Apoſtles, will be very plain, by conſidering how this Promiſe is expreſt by the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts; <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17. inſtead of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, you have theſe words, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after our Saviour had given them Commiſſion to go and preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature: He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> And then it follows, <hi>Theſe ſigns ſhall follow them that believe; in my Name they ſhall caſt out Devils, and ſhall ſpeak with new Tongues.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. inſtead of <hi>Lo, I am with you,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Behold, I ſend the promiſe of my Father upon you,</hi> that is, the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next Words, <hi>but tarry ye in the City of Jeruſalem, until ye be endowed with power from on high.</hi> This St. <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf interprets of the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4 5 <hi>He commanded them that they ſhould not depart from Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, but wait for the promiſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which, ſaith he, ye have heard of me. For John truly baptized with Water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, not many days hence.</hi> And v. 8. <hi>Ye ſhall receive
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:58790:145"/>
power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you, and ye ſhall be witneſſes unto me, both in Jeruſalem, and in all Judea, and in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, and unto the uttermoſt part of the Earth.</hi> So that no Man that compares theſe Texts together, can doubt, but that this was the primary meaning of this Promiſe, as it was made to the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But then it is as plain likewiſe, that this Promiſe is to be extended farther than to the Perſons of the Apoſtles, even to all thoſe that ſhould afterwards ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them in this Work of Preaching the Goſpel, and baptizing, becauſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour adds, that <hi>he would be with them to the end of the world</hi>; which Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they reach far beyond the Apoſtles Times, (as I ſhall ſhew by and by) muſt neceſſarily be extended to ſuch Perſons in after-Ages, as ſhould carry on the ſame Work.</p>
            <p>There are two famous Controverſies about the Senſe of theſe Words, in which this Promiſe is expreſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is concerning the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time mentioned in this Promiſe, <hi>Alway, to the end of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other concerning the Subſtance of the Promiſe it ſelf, what is meant by our Saviour's <hi>being with them.</hi> In the <hi>firſt</hi>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:58790:145"/>
we have to deal with the Enthuſiaſts, in the <hi>latter</hi> with the Papiſts. I ſhall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Pretences of both theſe, as briefly and plainly as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Concerning the Circumſtance of time expreſt in theſe words, <hi>Alway, to the end of the world.</hi> The Enthuſiaſts would perſuade us, that the meaning of theſe Phraſes is not to be extended beyond that Age, and that this Promiſe is to be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Apoſtles Perſons, and that the Senſe of it is, that Chriſt would be with the Apoſtles, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all their Days, ſo long as they ſhould live, and that would be, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to the end of that Age; thus they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it, and with no worſe deſign than to take away the Neceſſity of a Goſpel-Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>But this Pretence will vaniſh, if we can make good theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Letter of this Promiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends farther than the Perſons of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the continuance of that Age.</p>
            <p n="2">2. However that be, it is certain that the reaſon of it extends to all that ſhould ſucceed them in their Miniſtry, to the end of the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Letter of this Promiſe extends farther than the Perſons of the Apoſtles,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:58790:146"/>
and the continuance of that Age. I will eaſily grant that the Phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
ſignifies only <hi>continually; I will be with you continually</hi>; but then the other Phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, until the end of the World, is ſeveral times in Scripture undeniably uſed for the End and Diſſolution of all things, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any Probability be ſhewn to be ever uſed otherwiſe. In this Senſe it is unqueſtionably uſed three times, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>The Harveſt is the end of the World.</hi> v. 39. <hi>So ſhall it be at the end of the World.</hi> v. 40. and v. 49. it is ſaid, that at <hi>the end of the World, the Angels ſhall come forth, and ſever the wicked from the juſt, and caſt them into the Furnace</hi>; which muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be underſtood of the end of the World, and of the day of Judgment, or there will be no clear Text in the whole Bible to that purpoſe; and it is very probable, that this Phraſe is uſed in the ſame Senſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.3. where the Diſciples ask our Saviour, <hi>What ſhall be the ſign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</hi> as will appear to any one that conſiders our Saviour's Anſwer to this Queſtion; the latter part whereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, without too much Violence, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to any thing but the final
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:58790:146"/>
Diſſolution of the World. Now if this Phraſe be every where elſe in Scripture uſed in this Senſe, there is no reaſon why it ſhould be taken otherwiſe in the Text, only to ſerve the purpoſe of an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Opinion.</p>
            <p>I know there are Phraſes very near a-kin to this, which are uſed in a quite different Senſe, namely, for the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State; and that we may know how to diſtinguiſh them, it is obſervable, that when the Scripture ſpeaks of the end of the World, it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the end of the Age, in the ſingular Number; but when it ſpeaks of the Times before the Goſpel, it always expreſſeth them in the plural; the reaſon of which is, that famous Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition among the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Elias,</hi> which diſtributed the whole du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the World into three Ages; the Age before the Law, the Age under the Law, and the Age of the Meſſias; and this laſt Age they looked on with great difference from the reſt, as the famous and glorious Age, which was to be as it were the beginning of a new World: And therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Writings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly call it the <hi>ſeculum ſuturum,</hi> the Age, or the World to come: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58790:147"/>
the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> calls the State of the Goſpel by that name, as beſt known to them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. <hi>But unto the Angels hath he not put in ſubjection the world to come, whereof we now ſpeak</hi>; that is, the Law was given by the diſpoſition of Angels; but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel, which is call'd the World to come, was managed and adminiſtred by the Son of God. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5. thoſe miraculous Powers which accompanied the firſt preaching of the Goſpel. are call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Powers of the World to come,</hi> that is, of the Goſpel-Age.</p>
            <p>So that this laſt Age of the Goſpel, is that which the Scripture by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency calls <hi>the Age</hi>; thoſe that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are conſtantly call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in the plural number. So we find, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9. the Goſpel is call'd <hi>the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Myſtery that was hid in God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from Ages</hi>; and you have the ſame Phraſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. Upon the ſame account, the expiration of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, is in Scripture called <hi>the laſt times,</hi> and <hi>the laſt days,</hi> Heb. 1.2. <hi>But in theſe laſt days, God hath ſpoken to us by his Son:</hi> 1 Cor. 10.11. <hi>Theſe things are written for our Admonition, upon whom <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. But however this be, it is certain that the Reaſon of this Promiſe does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all thoſe that ſhould ſucceed the Apoſtles in their Miniſtry, to the end of the world: I will ſuppoſe now (to give our Adverſaries their utmoſt ſcope) that which we have no reaſon to grant, that the Letter of this Promiſe reacheth only to the Apoſtles and their Age, and that our Saviour's meaning was no more but this, that he would ſend down the Holy Ghoſt upon them in miraculous Gifts, to qualify and enable them for the ſpeedy planting and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of the Goſpel in the world, and that he would be with them, 'till this Work was done. Now ſuppoſing there were nothing more than this intended in the letter of it, this ought not much to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:58790:148"/>
trouble us, ſo long as it is certain, that the Reaſon of it does extend to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Apoſtles in all Ages of the world. I do not mean, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Promiſe does give us ſufficient Aſſurance, that God will aſſiſt the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Governors of his Church in all Ages, in the ſame extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he did the Apoſtles, becauſe there is not the like reaſon and neceſſity for it; but that we have ſufficient Aſſurance from the Reaſon of this Promiſe, that God will not be wanting to us, in ſuch fitting and neceſſary Aſſiſtance, as the ſtate of Religion, and the welfare of it in every Age ſhall require: For can we imagine that God would uſe ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary means to plant a Religion in the world, and take no care of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? That he who had begun ſo good a Work, ſo great and glorious a Deſign, would let it fall to the ground for want of any thing that was neceſſary to the Support of it?</p>
            <p>This is reaſonable in it ſelf; but we are not alſo without good ground for thus extending the general reaſon of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Promiſes beyond the Letter of them. The Apoſtle hath gone before us in this, for <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, 6. he there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58790:148"/>
two particular Promiſes of the Old Teſtament to all Chriſtians, <hi>Let your Converſation</hi> (ſays he) <hi>be without Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have: For he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> And again, <hi>The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what Man can do unto me.</hi> Theſe Promiſes were made to particular Perſons; the firſt of them to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the other to <hi>David</hi>; but yet the Apoſtle applies them to all Chriſtians, and to good Men in all Ages, becauſe the general Ground and Reaſon of them extended ſo far. He who gave <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>David</hi> this encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their Duty, will certainly be as good to us, if we do ours.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the firſt Controverſie about the Senſe of theſe Words, which concerns the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time mentioned in this Promiſe, <hi>always to the end of the World,</hi> and have plainly ſhewn, that both the Letter and the Reaſon of this Promiſe does extend further than the Perſons of the Apoſtles, and the continuance of that Age, even to all that ſhould ſucceed them in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to the end of the World. I come now to conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Subſtance of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58790:149"/>
it ſelf, namely, what is meant by our Saviour's <hi>being with them.</hi> And here our Adverſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would fain perſwade us, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the meaning of it is, that <hi>that</hi> Church ſhould always be infallible, and never err in the Faith. But as there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor any where elſe in Scripture upon the like Occaſion, whereby we might be directed to underſtand this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to be made to that Church; ſo to any unprejudiced Perſon the plain and obvious Senſe of this Promiſe can be no other than this, that our Saviour having commiſſionated the Apoſtles to go and preach the Chriſtian Religion in the World, he promiſes to aſſiſt them in this work, and thoſe that ſhould ſucceed them in it, <hi>to the end of the World.</hi> But how any Man can conſtrue this Promiſe, ſo as to make it ſignifie the perpetual Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I cannot for my life deviſe; and yet this is one of the main Texts upon which they build that old and tottering Fabrick of their Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.</p>
            <p>Here is a general Promiſe of Aſſiſtance to the Paſtors and Governours of the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58790:149"/>
Church, in all Ages to the end of the World; but that this Aſſiſtance ſhall always be to the degree of Infallibility, (as it was to the Apoſtles) can neither be concluded from the letter of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor from the Reaſon of it; much leſs can it be from hence concluded, that the Aſſiſtance here promiſed, if it were to the degree of Infallibility, is to be limited and confined to the ſupream Paſtor and Governour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>That the Aſſiſtance here promiſed ſhall always be to the degree of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, can by no means be concluded from the Letter of this Promiſe. Indeed there is no Pretence or Colour for it; he muſt have a very peculiar Sagacity, that can find out in theſe words, <hi>I am with you always,</hi> a promiſe of infallible Aſſiſtance. Is not the Promiſe which God made to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and which the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> applies to all Chriſtians, and to all Good Men in all Ages, <hi>I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> the very ſame in ſenſe with this, <hi>I will be with you always?</hi> and yet ſurely, no Man did ever imagine, that by virtue of this Promiſe, every Chriſtian, and every good Man is infallible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:58790:150"/>But neither can it be inferr'd from the Reaſon of this Promiſe, that this Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhall always be to the degree of Infallibility. It was ſo indeed to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; the miraculous Gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which were beſtowed upon them for the more ſpeedy and effectual planting and propagating of the Goſpel in the World, were a divine Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Confirmation to the Doctrine which they delivered; and having this divine Teſtimony given to them, we are certain that they were ſecured from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the delivery of that Doctrine. So that the Apoſtles had no other Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but what depended upon, and was evidenced by the miraculous Gifts wherewith they were endowed; and therefore without the like Gifts, none can with Reaſon pretend to the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. For Infallibility ſignifies an extraordinary Aſſiſtance of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereby thoſe who are thus aſſiſted are ſecured from Error. This every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Man may, if he pleaſeth, pretend to; but no Man is to be believed to have it, but he who can give ſuch Evidence of it, as is fit to ſatisfie reaſonable Men, that he hath it. Now the only ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Evidence of ſuch an extraordinary
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58790:150"/>
Divine Aſſiſtance is the Power of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. This indeed is the great exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Teſtimony of a Teacher come from God, <hi>if he do ſuch Works as none can do, except God he with him</hi>; and this Evidence the Prophets of old, and our Saviour, and his Apoſtles, always gave of their Infallibility. And if the Pope and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, can give the Teſtimony of ſuch Miracles for their Infallibility, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and our Saviour, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did work, we are ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. Such a Teſtimony as this would give the World a thouſand times more Satisfaction concerning their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, than all the ſubtil Arguments of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and all their Writers. But if they cannot, they may diſpute about it to the end of the World; and every Man that hath but the ſame confidence may pretend to it, with as much reaſon as they do.</p>
            <p>But to proceed in my Argument, here is a plain Reaſon why this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Aſſiſtance ſhould be granted to the Apoſtles at firſt; and another Reaſon as plain, why it ſhould not be continued afterwards. It was reaſonable, and in ſome degree neceſſary, that the Apoſtles ſhould be thus aſſiſted at the firſt publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58790:151"/>
of the Goſpel, namely to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the World, that they were faithful and true Witneſſes of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Miracles of Chriſt. But ſince this Doctrine and theſe Miracles are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to Poſterity, by thoſe very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were thus aſſiſted, here is as plain a Reaſon, why after the Goſpel was planted and eſtabliſht in the World, this Infallibility ſhould ceaſe. So long as we have an infallible Foundation of Faith, namely, the Divine Revelation conſigned in Writing, and tranſmitted down to us by Teſtimony of undoubted Credit, what need is there now of a fixt and ſtanding Infallibility in the Church? But having handled this Argument more at large elſe-where, I ſhall inſiſt no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon it here.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the <hi>three</hi> things I propounded to diſcourſe upon, from this Text. You have heard what Authority our Saviour had given him; what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he gave to his Diſciples; and what Aſſiſtance he hath promiſed to the Paſtors and Governors of his Church to the end of the World; namely, ſuch an Aſſiſtance as is ſuitable to the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Church, in the ſeveral Ages and States of Chriſtianity; which Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:58790:151"/>
was at firſt very extraordinary and miraculous. God was pleaſed to <hi>give witneſs</hi> to the firſt Teachers and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of the Goſpel, <hi>with ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and divers Miracles, and Gifts of the holy Ghoſt</hi>; and this at firſt was in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great degree neceſſary, it not being otherwiſe imaginable, how Chriſtianity could have born up againſt all that Force and violent Oppoſition which was raiſed againſt it: But this extraordinary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance was but a temporary and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Diſpenſation. God did, as it were, paſs by, <hi>in the ſtrong and mighty Wind, in the Earthquake, and in the Fire: but he</hi> was <hi>in the ſtill Voice,</hi> that is, he deſigned to ſettle and continue in that Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that more calm and ſecret way of Aſſiſtance, which offers leſs Violence to the Nature of Man, but which was intended for the conſtant and permanent Diſpenſation. So that we have no reaſon to think, that God hath now forſaken his Church, though he be not with it in ſo ſenſible and extraordinary a manner.</p>
            <p>But then if any particular Church deſire and expect this bleſſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit, we muſt remember, that there is a Condition to be performed on our
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58790:152"/>
parts. For how abſolute ſoever this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe may be, in reſpect of the Church univerſal; it is certainly conditional, to any particular Church, as ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in many Inſtances hath ſhewn. God hath long ſince left the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> where the Goſpel was firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht; he hath left the Church of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> where the Believers of the Goſpel were firſt call'd <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; he hath left the famous Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Deſolation, that the Ruins and Places of ſome of them, are hardly at this day certainly known. And this may alſo be the fate of any particular Church, not excepting <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf, for all her Pride and Confidence to the contrary. <hi>Behold therefore the Goodneſs and Severity of God: towards them that fell Severity; but towards us Goodneſs, if we continue in his Goodneſs: otherwiſe we alſo ſhall be cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, as I obſerved before, is ſpoken particularly to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf may be guilty of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Faith, and cut off by Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and indeed ſeems to foretel it; which how it conſiſts with their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Pretence to Infallibility, let them look to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:58790:152"/>And let all particular Churches look to themſelves that they do not forfeit this Promiſe of Divine Aſſiſtance. For Chriſt hath not ſo tyed himſelf to any particular Church, but that if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, he may leave them, and <hi>remove his Candleſtick from them.</hi> There have been many ſad Inſtances of this, ſince the firſt planting of Chriſtianity; and we have no ſmall Reaſon to apprehend that it may come to be our own caſe; for certainly we have many of thoſe marks of Ruin among us, which did foretel the Deſtruction of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and Nation; horrible Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Contempt of Religion, Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Animoſities to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and an univerſal Diſſoluteneſs and Corruption of Manners. And why ſhould we, who do the ſame things, think our ſelves exempted from the ſame Fate? What can we expect, but that God ſhould deal with us, as he did with them, <hi>Take away the Kingdom of God from us, and give it to a Nation that will bring forth the fruits of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Condition of this great Promiſe here in the Text, to the Paſtors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Chriſtian Church, is the faithful Execution of their Commiſſion;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:58790:153"/>
if they do ſincerely endeavour to gain Men to the Belief and Practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, Chriſt hath promiſed to be with them. The performance of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth primarily concern the chief Governours of the Church, and next to them the Miniſters of the Goſpel in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that they would be diligent and faithful in their reſpective Stations, <hi>teaching Men to obſerve all things, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt hath commanded.</hi> And if we would make this our great Work, to inſtruct our reſpective Charges, in the neceſſary Doctrines of Faith, and the indiſpenſable Duties of a good Life, we ſhould have far leſs trouble with them about other matters. And that we may do this Work effectually, we muſt be ſerious in our Inſtructions, and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in our Lives. <hi>Serious in our Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>; this certainly the Apoſtle requires in the higheſt degree, when he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Miniſters, <hi>ſo to ſpeak, as the Oracles of God,</hi> to which nothing can be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, than to trifle with the Word of God, and to ſpeak of the weightieſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the World, the great and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Concernments of the Souls of Men, in ſo ſlight and indecent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as is not only beneath the Gravity
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58790:153"/>
of the Pulpit, but even of a well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Stage. Can any thing be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable, than to hear a Miniſter of God from this ſolemn place to break Jeſts upon Sin, and to quibble upon the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Age? This is to ſhoot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Bullet, and as if we had no mind to do Execution, but only to make Men ſmile at the mention of their Faults; this is ſo nauſeous a Folly, and of ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious conſequence to Religion, that hardly any thing too ſevere can be ſaid of it.</p>
            <p>And then if we would have our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions effectual, we muſt be <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in our Lives. Ariſtotle</hi> tells, that the manners of the Speaker have <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the moſt ſoveraign power of Perſwaſion. And therefore <hi>Cato</hi> puts it into the definition of an Orator, that he is, <hi>vir bonus, dicendi peritus, a good Man, and an eloquent Speaker.</hi> This is true as to all kinds of Perſwaſion; the good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which Men have of the Speaker, gives great weight to his Words, and does ſtrangely diſpoſe the Minds of Men to entertain his Counſels. But the Reputation of Goodneſs is more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally neceſſary and uſeful to thoſe whoſe proper Work it is to perſwade Men to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58790:154"/>
be good; and therefore the Apoſtle, when he had charged <hi>Titus</hi> to put Men in mind of their Duty, he immediately adds, <hi>in all things ſhewing thy ſelf a Patern of good Works.</hi> None ſo fit to teach others their Duty, and none ſo likely to gain Men to it, as thoſe who practiſe it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; becauſe hereby we convince Men that we are in earneſt, when they ſee that we perſwade them to nothing, but what we chuſe to do our ſelves. This is the way to <hi>ſtop the Mouths of Men,</hi> and to confute their Malice, by an exemplary piety and Virtue. So St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. <hi>For ſo is the will of God, that by well doing ye put to ſilence the Ignorance of fooliſh Men.</hi>

            <p>THERE are two great Miſtakes about the Nature of Religion, equally falſe, and equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to the Souls of Men; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, whoſe great deſign it is to keep Men off from Religion by any Means, makes uſe of both theſe Miſtakes, to ſerve his own Purpoſe and Deſign upon the ſeveral Tempers of Men. Thoſe who are melancholy and ſerious, he diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and diſcourageth from attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, by the extream trouble and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:58790:155"/>
of it, repreſenting it in ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and frightful a Shape, encumber'd with ſuch Difficulties, and attended with ſuch Troubles and Sufferings, as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable, and intolerable to Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; whereby he perſwades Men, that they had better never attempt it, ſince they may deſpair to go through with it.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, thoſe who are ſanguine and full of hopes, he poſſeſſes with a quite contrary Apprehenſion; that the buſineſs of Religion is ſo ſhort and eaſie a Work, that it may be done at any time, and if need be, at the laſt Moment of our Lives, tho' it is not ſo well to put it upon the laſt hazard; and by this means, a great part of Mankind are lull'd in ſecurity, and adjourn the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Religion from time to time; and becauſe it is ſo eaſie, and ſo much in their Power, they ſatisfie themſelves with an indeterminate Reſolution to ſet about that buſineſs ſome time or other before they die, and ſo to repent, and make their Peace with God once for all.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pretences contradict one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore cannot be both true, but they may both be falſe, as indeed they are, and truth lies between them; Religion being neither ſo ſlight and eaſie
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58790:155"/>
a Work as ſome would have it, nor ſo extreamly difficult and intolerable, as others would repreſent it. To confute the falſe apprehenſions which ſome have of the eaſineſs of it, our Saviour tells us, there muſt be ſome <hi>ſtriving</hi>; and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us, that the difficulties of Religion are not ſo great and inſuperable, as ſome would make them, our Saviour tells us, that thoſe who <hi>ſtrive</hi> ſhall ſucceed and <hi>enter in</hi>; but thoſe who only <hi>ſeek,</hi> that is, do not vigorouſly ſet about the buſineſs of Religion, but only make ſome faint At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to get to Heaven, <hi>ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enter in.

            </p>
            <p>The occaſion of which words of our Bleſſed Saviour, was a Queſtion, that was put to him, by one of his Diſciples, concerning the number of thoſe, that ſhould be Saved, <hi>v.</hi> 23. One ſaid unto him, <hi>Lord, are there few that be Saved</hi>? To which curious Queſtion, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our (according to his manner, when ſuch kind of Queſtions were put to him) does not give a direct Anſwer, becauſe it was neither Neceſſary, nor Uſeful for his Hearers to be Reſolved in it, it did not concern them, to know what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:58790:156"/>
of Perſons ſhould be Saved, but what courſe they ſhould take that they might be of that Number; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, inſtead of ſatisfying their Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he puts them upon their Duty; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing them, inſtead of concerning themſelves what ſhould become of others, to take care of themſelves. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for many, I ſay unto you, ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> He does not ſay, that <hi>but few ſhall be ſaved</hi>; (as ſome have preſumptuouſly ventur'd to determine) but only <hi>few</hi> in compariſon of thoſe <hi>many, that ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi>

            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The firſt Difficulties of a Holy and Religious Courſe of Life, are here repreſented to us by a <hi>ſtrait Gate.</hi> For the <hi>Gate</hi> at which we enter, and the <hi>way</hi> in which we walk, can ſignifie nothing elſe, but the beginning and progreſs of a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Religious Courſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Our Diligence and Conſtancy in this Courſe, are repreſented by <hi>ſtriving,</hi> a word which hath a great Force and Emphaſis in it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Metaphor taken from the earneſt Contention which was uſed in the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, by thoſe who ſtrove for Maſtery in running or wreſtling, or any of the other Exerciſes which were there uſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:58790:157"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is a Reaſon added to enforce the Exhortation or Duty; <hi>for many ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able</hi>; that is, there are a great many that will do ſomething in Chriſtianity, and make ſome faint attempts to get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who yet ſhall fall ſhort of it, for want of ſuch a firm Reſolution and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs of Endeavour, as is neceſſary to the attaining of it.</p>
            <p>Having thus explained the Words, I ſhall take occaſion from the firſt part of them, namely, the Duty or Exhortation, to handle theſe <hi>three</hi> Points, very uſeful for us to conſider, and to be well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> The Difficulties of a Holy and Chriſtian Courſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The firm Reſolution, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Endeavour that is required on our part for the conquering of theſe Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> That theſe Difficulties are not ſo great and inſuperable, as to be a juſt Diſcouragement to our Endeavours; if we will <hi>ſtrive,</hi> we may maſter them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Difficulties of a Holy and Chriſtian Courſe. And theſe are either from our ſelves, or from ſomething without us.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:58790:157"/>1. From our ſelves, from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Corruption and Depravation of our Nature, and the power of evil Habits and Cuſtoms, contracted by vicious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. Our Natures are vitiated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, inclined to evil, and impotent to good; beſides that being habituated to Sin and Vice, it is a matter of infinite Difficulty to break off a Cuſtom, and to turn the courſe of our Life another way. Now becauſe this is the difficulty of our firſt Entrance into Religion, it is repreſented by a <hi>ſtrait Gate</hi> which is hard to get through.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are likewiſe other difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from without; as namely, the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Perſecution of the World, which was very raging and violent in the firſt beginnings of Chriſtianity. And this our Saviour repreſents by the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedneſs and roughneſs of the Way, as St. <hi>Matth.</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to Life, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, confragoſa eſt via,</hi> (ſo <hi>Grotius</hi> renders it) the Way is craggy, full of Afflictions and Troubles.</p>
            <p>So that theſe are the two great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in a Chriſtian Courſe, Indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from within, and Oppoſition from without.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:58790:158"/>1. Indiſpoſition from within. And this makes Religion ſo much the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, becauſe it checks us at our very firſt Entrance upon our Chriſtian Courſe, and makes us unwilling to ſet out. The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Nature, and thoſe vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Habits which by a long cuſtom of Sin we have contracted, do ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us the contrary way, ſo that a Man muſt offer great Force and Violence to himſelf that will conquer this Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is one of the hardeſt things in the World to break off a vicious Habit, and to get looſe from the Tyranny of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks of it, as next to a natural Impoſſibility, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin? or the Leopard his ſpots? Then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> This requires great Striving indeed. Nothing ſhows the Spirit, and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Man more, than to contend with an inveterate Habit; for in this caſe a Man ſtrives againſt the very bent and inclination of his Soul; and 'tis eaſier to ſet a Man againſt all the World, than to make him fight with himſelf: and yet this every Man muſt do, who from any wicked courſe of Life, betakes himſelf ſeriouſly to Religion: he muſt as it
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58790:158"/>
were lay violent Hands upon himſelf, and fight with the Man he was before; and this in Scripture is emphatically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt to us, by <hi>crucifying the old Man, with the Affections and Luſts thereof.</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian when he firſt enters upon a Holy and good Courſe of life, is repreſented as two Perſons or Parties at civil Wars one with another; <hi>the Old,</hi> and <hi>the New Man</hi>: So that whoever will be a Chriſtian muſt put off himſelf, and become another Man; and 'tis no eaſie matter for a Man to quit himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In our Chriſtian Courſe, we muſt likewiſe expect to meet with great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from without. Bleſſed be God, Chriſtianity hath generally been for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages free from this Difficulty, which attended the firſt Profeſſion of it; it was then indeed a very ſteep and craggy way, very rough and thorny, not to be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in without Sweat and Blood; then the Dangers and Hazards of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion were ſuch, as were not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by a mere moral Reſolution, and the natural Strength of Fleſh and Blood; the Perſecution that attended it was ſo hot, and the Torments which threatned it ſo terrible, that the ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and inconſiderate part of Mankind
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:58790:159"/>
would rather venture Hell at a diſtance, than run themſelves upon ſo preſent and evident a Danger.</p>
            <p>But ſince theſe Ages of Perſecution, this Difficulty hath been in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure removed. Not but that the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath ſtill its Enemies in the world; but they are not let looſe, as they were in thoſe times; It is ſtill perſecuted and expoſed to the Malice and Reproach, but not to the Rage and Fury of unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men. In the calmeſt times there is hardly any Man can be a ſtrict and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian, without being liable to Hatred and Contempt, without deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf many of thoſe worldly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which thoſe who make no Conſcience of the ſtrict Laws of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity may make to themſelves; ſo that at all times it requires a good degree of Conſtancy and Reſolution to perſevere in a Holy Courſe, and to bear up againſt the Oppoſition of the World, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand its Temptations, to be <hi>harmleſs and blameleſs in the midſt of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Nation</hi>; not to be infected with the eminent and frequent Examples of Vice, and carryed down with the ſtream of a corrupt and degenerate Age. So that tho' our Difficulties be not always the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58790:159"/>
ſame, and equal to thoſe which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians encountred, yet there is enough to exerciſe our beſt Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Care; tho' the main Body of the Enemies of Chriſtianity be broken, and <hi>the Sons of Anak be deſtroyed out of the Land</hi>; yet <hi>ſome of the old Inhabitants are ſtill left, to be Thorns in our Sides, and Pricks in our Eyes,</hi> that true Religion may always have ſomething to exerciſe its Force and Vigour upon. I have done with the <hi>firſt</hi> Point, the Difficulties of a Chriſtian Courſe. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second,</hi> The earneſt Endeavour that is to be uſed on our Part, for the conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Difficulties. And to the buſineſs of Religion, if we will ſet upon it in good earneſt, theſe <hi>three</hi> things are required.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> A mighty Reſolution to engage us in a Holy and Chriſtian Courſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Great Dilligence and Induſtry to carry us on in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> An invincible Conſtancy to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us through it, and make us perſevere in it to the end.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> A mighty Reſolution to engage us in a Holy and Good Courſe. For want of this, moſt Men miſcarry and ſtumble at the very Threſhold, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58790:160"/>
get through the <hi>ſtrait Gate,</hi> never maſter the Difficulties of the firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. Many are well diſpoſed toward Religion, and have fits of good Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that way, (eſpecially in their young and tender Years) but they want firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Reſolution to conquer the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the firſt entrance upon a religi-and virtuous Life; like the young Man that came to our Saviour, well inclined to do ſome <hi>good thing,</hi> that <hi>he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit eternal Life</hi>; but when it came to the point, he gave back, he was divided betwixt Chriſt and the World, and had not reſolution enough <hi>to part with all for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Men (I doubt not) have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Thoughts and Deliberations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a better Courſe of Life, and are in a good Mind to take up, and break off that lewd and riotous Courſe they are in; but they cannot bring themſelves to a fixt Purpoſe and Reſolution: and yet without this nothing is to be done, <hi>the double minded Man is unſtable in all his ways.</hi> There muſt be no Indifferency and Irreſoluteneſs in our Minds, if we will be Chriſtians; we muſt not ſtop at the <hi>Gate,</hi> but reſolve to preſs in. We ſee that Men can take up peremptory Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58790:160"/>
in other matters, to be rich and great in the World, and they can be true and ſtedfaſt to theſe Reſolutions; and why ſhould not Men reſolve to be Wiſe and Happy, and ſtand to theſe Reſolutions, and make them good? God is more ready to aſſiſt and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en theſe kind of reſolutions than any other; and I am ſure no man hath ſo much reaſon to reſolve upon any thing, as to live a Holy and Virtuous Life; no other reſolution can do a man that good, and bring him that comfort and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that this will.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The buſineſs of Religion, as it requires a mighty Reſolution to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us in a holy and good courſe, ſo likewiſe a great Diligence to carry us on in it. When we are got through the <hi>ſtrait gate,</hi> we muſt account to meet with many difficulties in our way; there are in the courſe of a Chriſtian's Life many Duties to be performed, which require great pains and care; many Temptations to be reſiſted, which will keep us continually upon our guard; a great part of the Way is up Hill, and not to be climb'd without Labour; and the Scripture frequently calls upon us, <hi>to work out our Salvation with fear and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:58790:161"/>
trembling,</hi> that is with great Care and Induſtry; <hi>to give all diligence to make our calling and election ſure</hi>; to follow Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to purſue it with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs. Nothing of this World that is of value, is to be had upon other terms; and we have low thoughts of Heaven, if we think any pains too much to get thither.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The buſineſs of Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an invincible Conſtancy to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us through it, and to make us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in it to the End. Reſolution may make a good entrance; but it requires great Conſtancy and Firmneſs of Mind, to hold out in a good Courſe. A good Reſolution may be taken up, upon a preſent heat, and may cool again; but nothing but a conſtant and ſteady tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind will make a man perſevere; and yet without this, no Man ſhall ever reach Heaven. <hi>He that continueth to the end ſhall be ſaved; but if any Man draw back, God's Soul will have no pleaſure in him.</hi> God puts this Caſe by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and determines it, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18.24. <hi>When the righteous Man turneth away from his Righteouſneſs, ſhall he live? all his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that he hath done, ſhall not be mentioned; in his Treſpaſs that he hath
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58790:161"/>
treſpaſſed, and in his Sin that he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in them he ſhall die</hi>; nay ſo far will his Righteouſneſs be from availing him, if he do not perſevere in it, that it will render his Condition much worſe, to have gone ſo far towards Heaven, and at laſt to turn his Back upon it. So St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21. <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the Pollutions of the World, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled therein and overcome; the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning; for it had been better for them not to have known the way of Righteouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> Point, namely, That the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Holy and a Chriſtian Life are not ſo great and inſuperable, as to be a juſt ground of diſcouragement to our Endeavours. All that I have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Difficulties of Religion, was with no deſign to damp, but rather to quicken our Induſtry; for, upon the whole matter, when all things are duly conſidered, it will appear, that <hi>Chriſt's yoke is eaſy and his burthen light; that the Commandments of God are not
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58790:162"/>
grievous</hi>; no, not this Commandment of <hi>ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate</hi>; which I ſhall endeavour to make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by taking theſe <hi>Four</hi> things into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Aſſiſtance which the Goſpel offers to us. God hath there promiſed <hi>to give his holy Spirit to them that ask him</hi>; and by the aſſiſtance of God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, we may be able to conquer all thoſe difficulties. Indeed if we were left to our ſelves, to the impotency and weakneſs of our own Nature, we ſhould never be able to cope with theſe Difficulties; every Temptation would be too hard for us; every little Oppoſition would diſcourage us: but <hi>God is with us,</hi> and <hi>there is nothing too hard for him.</hi> If the Principles of a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life, were only the Birth of our own Reſolution, they would eaſily be born down; but they are from God, of a Heavenly Birth and Original; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is <hi>born of God, overcometh the World.</hi> John 1.12, 13. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the priviledge) <hi>to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:58790:162"/>God conſiders the Impotency of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, in this deprav'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate into which we are ſunk, and therefore he hath not left us to our ſelves; but when he commands us to <hi>work out our own Salvation,</hi> he tells us for our Encouragement, that <hi>he himſelf works in us both to will and to do</hi>; he does not bid us to be ſtrong in our own ſtrength, for he knows we have no ſtrength of our own, but to be <hi>ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might</hi>; and what may not even a weak Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do, that is ſo powerfully aſſiſted? If we will but make uſe of this ſtrength, nothing can be too hard for us. All that God expects from us is, That we ſhould comply with the motions of his Spirit, and be as ſincere in the Uſe of our own endeavours, as he is in the offers of his Grace and Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us conſider, That the greateſt Difficulties are at firſt; 'tis but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one manful Onſet, and ſuſtaining the firſt Brunt, and the Difficulties will abate and grow leſs, and our ſtrength will every day encreaſe and grow more. <hi>The Gate is ſtrait</hi>: but when we have once got through it, <hi>our feet will be ſet in an open place.</hi> After ſome ſtrugling
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:58790:163"/>
to get through, we ſhall every day find our ſelves at more Eaſe and Liberty. It will be very hard at firſt, to maſter our vicious Inclinations, to change the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of our Minds, and the courſe of our Lives, and to act contrary to what we have been long accuſtomed: but this Trouble laſts but for a little while; theſe Pangs of the New-Birth, tho' they be ſharp, yet they are not uſually of long continuance.</p>
            <p>It does indeed require great Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and firmneſs of Mind, to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the firſt Difficulties of Religion: but if we can but ſtand it out for one brunt, our Enemy will give way, and the pleaſure of Victory will tempt us on. It is troubleſome to conflict with great Difficulties, and Men are loth to be brought to it: but when we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, it is one of the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the World to prevail and Conquer. Many Men are loth to go to War; but after a little Succeſs, they are as loth to give over; that which was a terrour to them at firſt, turns into a pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider that Cuſtom will make any courſe of life tolerable, and moſt things eaſie. Religion, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:58790:163"/>
of a Holy Life is difficult at firſt: but after we are once habituated to it, the trouble will wear off by degrees, and that which was grievous will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come eaſie; nay, by degrees, much more pleaſant than ever the contrary practice was We ſee the daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of this, in the moſt difficult and laborious Employments of this World; a little pains tires a Man at firſt, but when he is once ſeaſoned and enured to Labour, Idleneſs becomes more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and troubleſome to him than the hardeſt work. Cuſtom will make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing eaſie, tho' it be a little unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. Nothing is more unnatural than Sin; 'tis not according to our Original Nature and Frame, but it is the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Depravation of it, a ſecond Nature ſuperinduced upon us by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom: whereas the practice of Holineſs and Virtue is agreeable to our Original and Primitive State, and Sin and Vice are the perverting of Nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Reaſon, and the deſign of our Beings, and to all Obligations of Duty and Intereſt: But by returning to God and our Duty, we return to our Primitive State, we act naturally, and according to the intention of our Beings;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58790:164"/>
and when the force of a contrary Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is taken off, and the Byaſs clapt on the other ſide, <hi>we ſhall run the ways of God's Commandments with more delight</hi> and ſatisfaction, than ever we found in the Ways of Sin.</p>
            <p>For Sin is a violence upon our Natures, and that is always uneaſie, yet it is made more tolerable by Cuſtom: but Religion reſtores Men to their natural State, and then we are at eaſe and reſt. Religion is at firſt <hi>a yoke and burthen:</hi> but unleſs we <hi>take this upon us,</hi> we ſhall never <hi>find reſt to our Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> Conſider the Reward that Religion propounds, and this muſt needs ſweeten and mitigate all the Troubles and Difficulties that are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by it. This <hi>ſtrait gate,</hi> through which we muſt enter, and this <hi>craggy way</hi> which we are to climb up, <hi>leads to life</hi>; and he is a lazy man indeed, that will not ſtrive and ſtruggle for <hi>Life.</hi> All that a man can do, he will do for his Life, for this miſerable Life, which is ſo ſhort and uncertain, and <hi>born to trouble as the ſparks fly upward</hi>; a Life not worth the having, nor worth the keeping with any great care and trouble, if it were not in order to a better and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:58790:164"/>
happier life. But 'tis not this life which our Saviour means; that indeed were not worth all this ſtriving for: 'Tis Eternal Life; a State of perfect and endleſs Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; of <hi>joys unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> And who would not <hi>ſtrive to enter in at that gate,</hi> which leads to ſo much Felicity? Can a Man poſſibly take too much pains, be at too much trouble for a few Days, to be happy for ever?</p>
            <p>So often as I conſider what incredible Induſtry Men uſe for the Things of this Life, and to get a ſmall Portion of this World, I am ready to conclude, That either Men do not Believe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of another World, or that they do not underſtand them; elſe they could not think much to be at the ſame pains for Heaven, that they can chearfully beſtow for the obtaining of theſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things. Can we be ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable, as to think God unreaſonable, when he offers Heaven and Everlaſting Happineſs to us, upon as eaſy Terms, as any thing in this World is ordinarily to be had? And are not we very fooliſh and unwiſe, to put away Eternal Life from us, when we may have it upon Terms ſo infinitely below the true worth and value of it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:58790:165"/>I have now done with the <hi>Three</hi> Things which I propounded to ſpeak to from the firſt part of theſe Words, which are ſo many Arguments to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Exhortation here in the Text; <hi>to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> and to give all Diligence, by the courſe of a Holy and Virtuous life, to get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and we may aſſure our ſelves, that nothing leſs than this will bring us thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So our Saviour tells us, in the latter part of the Text; that <hi>many ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> I proceed now to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> part of the Text; the Reaſon or Argument whereby this Exhortation is enforced; <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for many, I ſay unto you, ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> Every <hi>ſeeking</hi> to <hi>enter in</hi> will not gain our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into Heaven; therefore there muſt be <hi>ſtriving:</hi> For Men may do many things in Religion, and make ſeveral faint Attempts to get to Heaven, and yet at laſt fall ſhort of it, for want of that earneſt Contention and Endeavour which is neceſſary to the attaining of it. We muſt make Religion our buſineſs, and ſet about it with all our might, and perſevere and hold out in it, if ever we
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:58790:165"/>
hope to be admitted to Heaven; <hi>for many ſhall ſeek to enter,</hi> that ſhall be <hi>ſhut out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what this <hi>ſeeking</hi> is, which is here oppoſed to <hi>ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> our Saviour declares after the Text, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>When once the Maſter of the Houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the door; and ye begin to ſtand without, and knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he ſhall anſwer and ſay unto you, I know you not whence ye are: Then ſhall ye begin to ſay, we have eaten and drunk in thy Preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets; but he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me all ye workers of Iniquity.</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> mentions ſome other Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which they ſhould make; upon which they ſhould lay claim to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Many will ſay unto me in that Day, Lord, Lord, have we not Propheſied in thy Name? and in thy Name have caſt out Devils? and in thy Name done many wonderful works? And then will I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs unto them, I never knew you; depart
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58790:166"/>
from me ye that work Iniquity.</hi> After all their ſeeking to enter in, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe Pretences, they ſhall be ſhut out, and be for ever baniſht from the Preſence of God. This ſhall be their doom, which will be much the heavier, becauſe of the diſappointment of their confident expectation and hope. So St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>v</hi> 28. <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth; when ye ſhall ſee Abraham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Iſaac, and Jacob, and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and ye your ſelves thruſt out. And they ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and from the North, and from the South, and ſhall ſit down in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> To which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> adds, Chap 8. v. 12. <hi>But the Children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt out into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> And then our Saviour concludes (Luke 13.30) <hi>Behold, there are laſt that ſhall be firſt, and firſt which ſhall be laſt.</hi> From all which it appears, with what Confidence many Men, upon theſe falſe Pretences (which our Saviour calls <hi>ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enter in</hi>) ſhall lay claim to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and how ſtrangely they ſhall be diſappointed of their expectation and hope; when they ſhall find themſelves
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:58790:166"/>
caſt out of Heaven, who they thought had out done all others in Religion, and were the only Members of the true Church, and <hi>the Children and Heirs of the Kingdom</hi>; and ſhall ſee others, whom they thought to be out of the Pale of the true Church, and excluded from all terms of Salvation, come from all Quarters, and find free Admiſſion into Heaven; and ſhall find themſelves ſo groſly and widely miſtaken, that thoſe very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom they thought to be <hi>laſt,</hi> and of all others fartheſt from Salvation, ſhall be <hi>firſt</hi>; and they themſelves whom they took for <hi>the Children of the Kingdom,</hi> and ſuch as ſhould be admitted into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the firſt place, ſhall be rejected and caſt out.</p>
            <p>So that by <hi>ſeeking to enter,</hi> we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all thoſe things which M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n may do in Religion, upon which they ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to lay claim to Heaven, nay and confidently hope to obtain it; and yet ſhall be ſhamefully diſappointed, and fall ſhort of it. Whatever Men think, and believe, and do in Religion, what Privileges ſoever Men pretend, what Ways and Means ſoever Men endeavour to appeaſe the Deity, and to recommend themſelves to the Divine Favour and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:58790:167"/>
Acceptance, all this is but <hi>ſeeking to enter in,</hi> and is not that <hi>ſtriving</hi> which our Saviour requires. <hi>If Men do not do the will of God, but are workers of Iniquity,</hi> it will all ſignify nothing to the obtaining of Eternal Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour here inſtanceth in Mens Profeſſion of his Religion, <hi>calling him Lord, Lord</hi>; in their perſonal Familiarity and Converſation with him, by <hi>eating and drinking in his Preſence</hi> and Company; in their having heard him preach the Doctrine of Life and Salvation, <hi>Thou haſt taught in our ſtreets</hi>; in their having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, and wrought great Miracles in his Name and by his Power, <hi>Have we not propheſied in thy Name? and in thy Name caſt out devils? and in thy Name done many wonderful works</hi>? Theſe were great and glorious Things which they boaſted of; and yet nothing of all this will do, if Men <hi>do not the Will of God</hi>; notwithſtanding all this, he will ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>I know ye not whence ye are, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, ye workers of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by a plain Parity of Reaſon, whatever elſe Men do in Religion, what Attempts ſoever Men may make to get to Heaven, upon what Priviledges or Pretences ſoever they may lay claim to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:58790:167"/>
eternal Life, they will certainly fall ſhort of it, if they <hi>do not do the will of God,</hi> but <hi>are workers of Iniquity.</hi> My buſineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at this time ſhall be, to diſcover the ſeveral falſe Claims and Pretences which Men may make to Heaven, and yet ſhall never enter into it. And to this purpoſe I ſhall inſtance in ſeveral Particulars, by one or more of which, Men commonly delude themſelves, and are apt to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain vain and ill-grounded hopes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> Some truſt to the external Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the true Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Others have attained to a good degree of Knowledge in Religion, and they rely much upon that.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> There are others that find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much affected with the Word of God, and the Doctrines contained it it.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> Others are very ſtrict and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout in the external Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> Others confide much in their being Members of the only true Church, in which alone Salvation is to be had, and in the manifold Privileges and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which therein they have above others of getting to Heaven.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> Others think their great Zeal for God, and his true Religion, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſave them.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:58790:168"/>7<hi>thly,</hi> Others go a great way in the real Practice of Religion.</p>
            <p n="8">8<hi>thly,</hi> Others rely much upon the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their Repentance and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whereby they are put into a ſtate of Grace, and become the Children of God, and Heirs of everlaſting Life; and being once truly ſo, they can never fall from that State, ſo as finally to miſcarry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Others venture all upon a Death-bed Repentance, and their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity with God to receive them to Mercy at the laſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly go over theſe particulars, which are the ſeveral ways whereby Men <hi>ſeek to enter</hi> into Heaven, and hope to get thither at laſt; and ſhall ſhew the Inſufficiency of them; and that there is ſomething beyond all this neceſſary to be done for the attainment of Everlaſting Salvation.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> Some truſt to the mere external Profeſſion of the true Religion, and think it enough to call Chriſt, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> to be baptized in his Name, and thereby to be admitted Members of the Chriſtian Church. What the Apoſtle ſays of the Profeſſion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, and the outward Badge of it, <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> may be applied to the Profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:58790:168"/>
made in Baptiſm, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 25, 28, 29. <hi>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and reſteſt in the Law, and makeſt thy boaſt of God. Circumciſion verily profiteth, if thou keep the Law; but if thou be a breaker of the Law, thy Circumciſion is made <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion: For he is not a Jew that is one outwardly, neither is that Circumciſion, which is outward in the Fleſh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the letter.</hi> The Caſe is the ſame of thoſe who make only an outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity. <hi>Baptiſm verily profiteth, if we perform the Condition of that Covenant which we entred into by Baptiſm</hi>; but if we do not, <hi>our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is no Baptiſm:</hi> For <hi>he is not a Chriſtian, which is one outwardly, nor is that Baptiſm which is outward in the Fleſh; but he is a Chriſtian which is one inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Baptiſm is of the Heart, in the Spirit, and not in Water only.</hi> So St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. that <hi>Baptiſm is not</hi> only the waſhing of the Body with Water, and <hi>the putting away of the Filth of the Fleſh; but the anſwer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Promiſe of eternal Life and Happineſs is not made to the external
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:58790:169"/>
Profeſſion of Religion, without the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and real Practice of it. <hi>Why call ye me, Lord, Lord,</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>and do not the things which I ſay?</hi> The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath no where ſaid, <hi>he that is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſhall be ſaved</hi>; but <hi>he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and is baptized, he that repenteth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> This deſerves to be ſeriouſly conſidered by a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians, who have nothing to ſhew for their Chriſtianity, but their Names; whoſe beſt Title to Heaven is their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, an Engagement entred into by others in their Name, but never confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made good by any Act of their own; a thing which was done before they remember, and which hath no other effect upon their Hearts and Lives, than if it were quite forgotten.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> There are others who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a good degree of Knowledge in Religion, and they hope <hi>that</hi> will ſave them. But if our Knowledge in Religion, though never ſo clear and great, do not deſcend into our Hearts and Lives, and govern our Actions, all our hopes of Heaven are built upon a falſe and ſandy Foundation. So our Saviour tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Every one that heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:58790:169"/>
not, ſhall be likened unto a fooliſh man, which built his Houſe upon the Sand.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 13.17. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not a greater Cheat in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nothing wherein Men do more groſly impoſe upon themſelves, than in this matter, as if the Knowledge of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, without the Practice of it, would bring Men to Heaven. How diligent are many in reading and hearing the Word of God, who yet take no care to practiſe it in their Lives? Like thoſe in the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. of whom God complains, <hi>They come unto thee as the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cometh, and they ſit before thee as my People, and they hear my words; but they will not do them.</hi> None do ſo fooliſhly, and yet ſo deſervedly miſs of Happineſs, as thoſe who are very careful to learn the way to Heaven, and when they have done, will take no pains at all to get thither.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> There are others who find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much affected with the Word of God, and the Preaching of it; and this they take for a very good Sign, that it hath its due effect upon them. And this happens very frequently, that the Word of God makes conſiderable Impreſſions
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:58790:170"/>
upon Men for the preſent, and they are greatly affected with it, and troubled for their Sins, and afraid of the Judgments of God, and the terrible Vengeance of another world; and upon this they take up ſome Reſolutions of a better Courſe, which after a little while vaniſh and come to nothing. This was the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear the Prophet ſpeak to them in the Name of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.32. <hi>And lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely Song of one that hath a pleaſant Voice, and can play well upon an Inſtrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not.</hi> Mark 6.20. it is ſaid that <hi>Herod</hi> had a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>that he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, and heard him gladly</hi>; but yet for all that, he continued the ſame cruel and bad Man that he was before. And in the Parable of the Sower, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20. there are one ſort of Hearers mention'd, who, <hi>when they heard the word, received it with joy; but having no root in themſelves, they endured but for a while, and when Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation or Perſecution ariſeth, becauſe of the Word, preſently they are offended.</hi> There are many Men who have ſudden Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Religion, and are mightily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for the preſent: but it muſt be a
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:58790:170"/>
rooted and ſixt Principle, that will endure and hold out againſt great Difficulties and Oppoſition. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. it is ſaid, that when <hi>St Paul reaſoned of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Temperance, and Judgment to come, Felix trembled</hi>; and nothing is more frequent, than for Men to be mightily ſtartled at the Preaching of the Word, when their Judgments are convinced and born down, and their Conſciences touched to the quick; a lively repreſentation of the Evil of Sin, and the infinite Danger of a ſinful Courſe, may ſtir up the Paſſions of Grief and Fear, and dart ſuch ſtings into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Men, as may make them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely reſtleſs and unquiet, and work ſome good Thoughts and Inclinations in them towards a better Courſe; and yet like Metals, when the heat is over, they may be the harder for having been melted down.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> Others ſhew great Strictneſs and Devotion in the Worſhip of God, and this they hope will be accepted, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſail to bring them to Heaven: and yet ſome of the worſt of Men have been very eminent for this. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were the moſt exact People in the world in matter of external Ceremony and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58790:171"/>
and yet for all this, our Saviour plainly tells them, that <hi>they were farther from the Kingdom of God,</hi> than thoſe who ſeemed to be fartheſt, <hi>than Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Harlots</hi>; and that becauſe they were ſo very bad, under ſo great a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Devotion, <hi>therefore they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the greater Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not but that External Devotion is a neceſſary expreſſion of Religion, and highly acceptable to God, when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a pious and devout Mind, and when Men are really ſuch in their Hearts and Lives, as their external De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion repreſents them to be: But when the outward Garb of Religion is only made a Cloak for Sin and Wickedneſs, when there is nothing within to anſwer all the Shew that we ſee without, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more odious and abominable to God. Theſe are mere Engines and Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits in Religion, all the Motions we ſee without proceed from an artificial Contrivance, and not from any inward Principle of Life; and as no Creature is more ridiculous than an Ape, becauſe the Beaſt makes ſome pretence to human Shape; ſo nothing is more fulſome than this hypocritical Devotion, becauſe it
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:58790:171"/>
looks like Religion, but is the fartheſt from it of any thing in the World.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> Others confide very much in their being Members of the only true Church, in which alone Salvation is to be had, and in the manifold Privileges and Advantages which they have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by above others, of getting to Heaven. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> confined Salvation to themſelves, and looked upon all the reſt of the World as excluded from it. And not only ſo, but they believed that by one means or other every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſhould be ſaved. So that they were the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Catholick Church, out of which there was no hope of Salvation for any.</p>
            <p>The ſame Pretence is made by ſome Chriſtians at this day, who engroſs Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to themſelves, and will allow none to go to Heaven out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of their Church; and have ſo ordered the matter, that hardly any that are in it can miſcarry. They are Members of an infallible Church, which cannot poſſibly err in Matters of Faith, <hi>they have</hi> not only <hi>eat and drunk in Chriſt's preſence,</hi> but have eat and drunk his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Corporal Preſence, the natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Fleſh and Blood; they have not only our bleſſed Saviour, but innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:58790:172"/>
other Interceſſors in Heaven; they have not only their own Merits to plead for them, but in caſe they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, they may have the Merits of others aſſigned and made over to them, out of the infinite Stock and Treaſure of the Church, upon which they may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Eternal Life, as of right and due belonging to them; and by a due courſe of Confeſſion and Abſolution, may quit ſcores with God for all their Sins from time to time. Or if they have neglected all this, they may, after the moſt flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious courſe of Life, upon <hi>Attrition</hi> (that is, upon ſome Trouble for Sin, out of fear of Hell and Damnation) joined with <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Abſolution,</hi> get to Heaven at laſt; provided the Prieſt mean honeſtly, and do not for want of Intention, deprive them of the ſaving Benefit and Effect of this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>But is it poſſible Men can be deluded at this Rate! as to think that Confidence of their own good Condition, and want of Charity to others, will carry them to Heaven? That any Church hath the Privilege to ſave impenitent Sinners? And they are really impenitent, who do not exerciſe ſuch a Repentance, as the Goſpel plainly requires; and if Men dye
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:58790:172"/>
in this ſtate, whatever Church they are of, the great Judge of the World hath told us, that <hi>he will not know them,</hi> but will bid them <hi>to depart from him, becauſe they have been Workers of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> Others think that their Zeal for God and his true Religion will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſave them. But Zeal, if it be not <hi>according to Knowledge,</hi> if it be miſtaken in its Object, or be irregular and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in the degree, is ſo far from being a Virtue, that it may be a great Sin and Fault; and tho' it be for the Truth, yet if it be deſtitute of Charity, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Virtues of a good Life, it will not avail us. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>tho' a Man ſhould give his Body to be burnt; yet if he have not Charity, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7<hi>thly,</hi> Others go a great way in the real Practice of Religion, and this ſure will do the buſineſs. And it is very true, and certain in experience, that Religion may have a conſiderable Awe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon Men's Hearts and Lives, and yet they may fall ſhort of Happineſs. Men may in many conſiderable Inſtances perform their Duty to God and Man; and yet the retaining of one Luſt, the practice of any one known Sin, may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:58790:173"/>
them from <hi>entring in at the ſtrait Gate. Herod</hi> did not only <hi>hear John glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but <hi>did many things</hi> in Obedience to his Doctrine; and yet he was a very bad Man. The <hi>Phariſee thanked God</hi> (and it may be truly) <hi>that he was not like other Men, an extortioner, or unjuſt, or an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer</hi>; and yet the penitent <hi>Publican</hi> was <hi>juſtified before him.</hi> The young Man who came to our Saviour to know what he ſhould do to enter into Life, and of whom our Saviour teſtifies, that he was <hi>not far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> and that he <hi>wanted but one thing</hi>; yet for want of that he miſcarried. And St. <hi>James</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that <hi>if a Man keep the whole Law. and yet fail in one point, he is guilty of all,</hi> If we be <hi>workers of Iniquity</hi> in any one kind Chriſt will diſown us, and bid us <hi>depart from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8<hi>thly,</hi> Others rely upon the Sincerity of their Repentance and Converſion, whereby they are put into a ſtate of Grace, from whence they can never fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally fall. They did once very hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent of their wicked Lives, and did change their Courſe, and were really reformed, and continued a great while in that good Courſe. And all this may be certainly true; but it is as certain that
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:58790:173"/>
they are relapſed into their former evil Courſe: And if ſo, the Prophet hath told us their Doom, that <hi>if the righteous man forſake his Righteouſneſs, his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhall not be remembred; but in the Sin that he hath ſinned, in that ſhall he die.</hi> So that a <hi>Righteous Man</hi> may <hi>turn from his Righteouſneſs, and commit Iniquity and dye in it.</hi> For the Prophet doth not here (as ſome vainly pretend) put a caſe, which is impoſſible in Fact ſhould happen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they will ſay, that the other Caſe which he puts together with it, of <hi>the wicked Mans turning away from his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and doing that which is lawful and right,</hi> is likewiſe impoſſible, which God forbid. And that Men may fall from a ſtate of Grace is no matter of Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to good Men; but a good caution againſt Security, and an Argument to greater Care and Watchfulneſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall</hi>; which Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition were ſurely to little purpoſe, if it were impoſſible for them that <hi>ſtand</hi> to <hi>fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Others venture all upon a Death-bed Repentance, and their Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity with God to receive them to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at laſt. This indeed is only <hi>to ſeek,</hi> and

not <hi>to ſtrive to enter in</hi>; and theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are they whom our Saviour repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents as <hi>ſtanding without,</hi> and <hi>knocking at the door, ſaying Lord, Lord, open unto us</hi>; Or as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Many ſhall ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord,</hi> which is moſt probably meant of the day of Judgment, when their Caſe is brought to the laſt extremity; and next to that is the day of Death, when Men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a ſtate of endleſs Happineſs or Miſery. And no wonder, if the Sinner would then be glad, when he can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continue in this World, to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Happineſs in the next: but the Door is then ſhut to moſt Sinners, and it is a Miracle of God's Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if any Repentance that Men can then exerciſe, (which at the beſt muſt needs be very confuſed and imperfect) will then be accepted; if any Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which Men can then uſe, will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable. For with what Face can we expect, that after all the evil Actions of a long Life, God ſhould be mollified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us by a few good Words, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a forc'd and conſtrained Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for all our wilful and deliberate Crimes, and that he ſhould forgive us all our Sins upon a little Importunity,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:58790:174"/>
when we can ſin no longer, and would repent no ſooner.</p>
            <p>Let us then by all that hath been ſaid, be effectually perſwaded to mind the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Religion in good earneſt, and with all our might, eſpecially the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, in the exerciſe of all the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Virtues of a good Life. Let us heartily repent of all the Sins of our paſt Life, and reſolve upon a better courſe for the future; and let us not delay and put off this neceſſary Work to the moſt unfit and improper time of old Age, and Sickneſs, and Death: but let us ſet about it preſently, and enter upon a good Courſe, and make all the Speed and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in it we can.</p>
            <p>And let us remember, that whatever we do in Religion will not bring us to Heaven if we do not <hi>do the will of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven</hi>; if we do not give up our ſelves to a conſtant and univerſal Obedience of his Laws. This is <hi>to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate</hi>: And tho' we <hi>ſtrive to enter in</hi> a Thouſand other Ways, <hi>we ſhall not be able</hi>; and after all our Confidence and Conceit of our ſelves, and our own Righteouſneſs, and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Salvation from the Privileges of any Church, it will be a ſtrange
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:58790:175"/>
Damp and Diſappointment to us, to ſee the ſincere Chriſtians, who have done the Will of God, and lived in Obedience to his Laws, to come from all quarters, and Churches in the World, and <hi>ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob in the Kingdom of God,</hi> when we who thought our ſelves <hi>the Children of the Kingdom, ſhall be caſt out,</hi> becauſe we have been <hi>Workers of Iniquity.</hi> I will conclude all with thoſe plain Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9. <hi>To them, who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory and honour, and Immortality; eternal Life: But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the Truth, but obey <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs; indignation and wrath, tribulation, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh upon every Soul of Man that doth evil; in the day when God ſhall judge the Secrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt according to the Goſpel.</hi>

                     <hi>Sermon I. LUKE XVI.19, 20.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>There was a certain Rich Man, which was cloathed in Purple and fine Linen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day: And there was a certain Beggar, named Lazarus, which was laid at his Gate full of Sores.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Intend by God's Aſſiſtance to go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Parable, than which I think there is none in the whole Goſpel, which is more apt to affect Men, or which is more artificially contrived, and in the Circumſtances whereof a greater <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> is obſerved.</p>
            <p>It is a great Queſtion among Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, whether this Narration concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rich Man and <hi>Lazarus</hi> be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:58790:176"/>
or a Hiſtory,<note place="margin">Vol. V.</note> or a mixture of both. That it is not a Hiſtory, the reſemblance between it, and others of our Saviour's Parables, will eaſily convince any Man that is not contentious; beſides that, in ſome ancient Copies, 'tis uſher'd in with this Preface, <hi>And he ſpake a Parable to his Diſciples, A certain Rich Man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But yet, as ſome of the Ancients have not improbably conjectur'd, it ſeems to be ſuch a kind of Parable, as had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a real Foundation; as namely, that there was ſuch a poor Man as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> is here deſcribed, and of that Name among the <hi>Jews</hi>: For in a meer Parable 'tis altogether unuſual to name Perſons, nor is this done in any other of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Parables.</p>
            <p>But whether this be ſo or not, is not worth the diſputing, becauſe it alters not the caſe as to our Saviour's purpoſe, and the Inſtructions which we may learn from it.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this Parable, I ſhall explain it as I go along, and draw <hi>two</hi> ſorts of Inſtructions or Obſervations from it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> ſort of Obſervations ſhall be from the Circumſtances which ſerve for the <hi>Decorum</hi> of the Parable: And
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:58790:176"/>
theſe I will not warrant to be all inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by our Saviour;<note place="margin">Ser. 10.</note> but only to be true in themſelves and uſeful and to have a probable riſe from ſome Circumſtances of the Parable; and therefore I ſhall ſpeak but very briefly to them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> ſort of Obſervations ſhall be ſuch as are grounded upon the main Scope and Intent of the Parable; and theſe I ſhall inſiſt more largely upon. I begin,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> With thoſe Obſervations and Inſtructions which I ſhall gather up from the Circumſtances which ſerve for the <hi>Decorum</hi> of the Parable; and I ſhall take them in order as they lie in the Parable.</p>
            <p>Ver. 19. <hi>There was a certain Rich Man, which was cloathed in purple and fine linnen, and fared ſumptuouſly every Day.</hi> Some think that our Saviour in this deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reflected upon <hi>Herod,</hi> becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes this Rich Man to be <hi>cloathed in Purple.</hi> But this Conjecture is without reaſon; for beſides that, it was not our Saviour's Cuſtom in his Preaching, to give ſecret Girds to the Magiſtrate; 'tis certain that it was long after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's time, that Purple was appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to Kings. It was then, and a great while after, the wear of rich and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:58790:177"/>
Men, and of the Favourites and great Men of the Court, who are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in ancient Hiſtories call'd the <hi>Purpurati,</hi> thoſe that wore Purple.</p>
            <p>That which I obſerve from hence, is, that the rich Man is not here cenſured for enjoying what he had, for wearing rich Apparel, and keeping a great Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This of it ſelf, if it be according to a Man's Eſtate and Quality, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intemperance, is ſo far from being a fault, that it is a commendable vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. But here was his Fault, that he made all to ſerve his own Senſuality and Luxury, without any conſideration of the Wants and Neceſſities of others: Whereas, one of the great Uſes of the plentiful Tables of Rich Men, is from the ſuperfluity of them to feed the Poor and the hungry.</p>
            <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And there was a certain Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar named Lazarus,</hi> as if our Saviour had ſaid, for inſtance, poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom ye all knew. And here I cannot but take notice of the Decorum which our Saviour uſes. He would not name any Rich Man, becauſe that was invidious, and apt to provoke. He endeavours to make all Men ſenſible of their Duty; but he would provoke none of them by
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:58790:177"/>
any peeviſh Reflection; for nothing is more improper than to provoke thoſe whom we intend to perſwade. While a Man's Reaſon is calm and undiſturbed, it is capable of Truth fairly propounded; but if we once ſtir up Men's Paſſions, it is like muddying of the Waters, they can diſcern nothing clearly afterwards. But to proceed in the Parable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There was a certain Beggar named Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, which was laid at the Rich Man's gate full of Sores, and was deſirous to be fed with the crumbs which fell from his Table, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Dogs came and licked his ſores.</hi> Here are <hi>three</hi> great Aggravations of the Rich Man's uncharitableneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> That here was an Object preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſelf to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Such an Object as would move any ones Pity, a Man reduced to extream Miſery and Neceſſity.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> A little Relief would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented him.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> Here was an Object preſented it ſelf to him, <hi>Lazarus</hi> laid at the Rich man's Gate; ſo that ſo often as he went out of his own Houſe and came in, he could not but take notice of him. Good Men that are charitably diſpoſed, will enquire out Objects for their Charity, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:58790:178"/>
ſtay 'till they thruſt themſelves upon them: But he is a very bad Man, who, when an Object of great Pity and Charity is preſented, is ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting towards him, that he ſtops his Ear to his Cry, and turns away his Face from him. He is an uncharitable Man, who being Rich, and hearing of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of others, does not take them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Conſideration: But what we ſee with our Eyes is much more apt to affect us. So that this was an Argument of a very cruel diſpoſition in the Rich Man, that having ſo many Occaſions of ſeeing <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> he ſhould never be moved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate him.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Here was ſuch an Object preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, as would move any ones Pity, a Man reduced to extream Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Neceſſity. Here was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Object of Charity, a Man, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in extream Want, but in great Pain and Anguiſh, and ſo helpleſs, that he was unable to keep off the Dogs from being troubleſome to him. And yet this did not move him.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> A very little Relief would have contented this Poor Man, and have been a great Kindneſs to him; that which the Rich Man might have ſpared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:58790:178"/>
the leaſt Prejudice to himſelf. He would have been glad to have been <hi>fed with the crumbs which fell from the Rich Man's table</hi>; and yet the Parable inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that the Rich Man was ſo hard-hearted, as not to afford him theſe.</p>
            <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And it came to paſs that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's boſom.</hi> Here was a great and ſudden Change! He, who when he was alive was neglected by Men, and contumeliouſly expoſed like a dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs to the Dogs, when he dies, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on by the Angels, and by them ſafely conveyed into a ſtate of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Happineſs. He who lay at the Rich Man's Gate, and could find no entrance there, is admitted into Heaven. <hi>The Beggar died, and was carried into Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's boſom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis very obſervable, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in this Parable repreſents Men as paſſing immediately out of this Life into a ſtate of Hppineſs or Torment. And as in no other place of Scripture, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this, where it had been ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, does our Saviour give the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of the ſtate of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath deviſed, and makes ſo much Profit and Advantage of,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:58790:179"/>
which, becauſe it is ſo viſible and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, we may without Uncharitableneſs ſuppoſe to be the reaſon why they keep ſuch a ſtir about it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And was carried by the Angels into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's boſom.</hi> It was an ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Angels did attend good Men at their Death, and carry their Souls into <hi>Paradice,</hi> which is here call'd <hi>Abraham's boſom.</hi> And this was a proper place for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who had been neglected by the Rich Man; to be conveyed into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, who was of a quite contrary temper, and loved to entertain and relieve Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Paradice</hi> is fitly call'd <hi>Abraham's boſom,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſo great a Veneration for <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly for his eminent Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they gave him the firſt place among the bleſſed. Hence is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.11. of <hi>ſitting down with Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of God.</hi> Now this Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>being in Abraham's boſom,</hi> is an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to the Cuſtom of Feaſts among the <hi>Jews,</hi> where the moſt eſteemed and beloved Gueſt ſat next him that was chief at the Feaſt, and leaned on his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:58790:179"/>
Hence St. <hi>John</hi> is call'd the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> loved, becauſe when he ſat at Meat, he leaned on his Boſom. <hi>John</hi> 13.23. Hence likewiſe is the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Saviour's being <hi>in the Boſom of his Father,</hi> to ſignifie his dearneſs to him, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. <hi>No Man hath ſeen God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed. <hi>The Rich Man alſo died, and was buried. The Rich Man alſo died</hi>; this is very elegant and emphatical, inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating to us, what the Scripture ſo often takes notice of, that Riches, for all Men's confidence in them, will not deliver from Death. This Rich Man indeed was out of Danger of being ſtarved and famiſht, as poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> was: But Death had other ways to come at him. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable enough, that he might be ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>faring ſumptuouſly every day. The Rich Man alſo died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And was buried.</hi> And here again we may obſerve the ſtrict <hi>Decorum</hi> which our Saviour uſes in this Parable. It is not ſaid of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that <hi>he was buried,</hi> but only that <hi>he died</hi>; it is probable that he was flung out of the way into ſome Pit or other: But of the Rich Man it is ſaid,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:58790:180"/>
               <hi>he was buried.</hi> And this is all the advantage which a Rich Man hath by a great Eſtate after he is dead, to have a pompous and ſolemn Funeral; which yet ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him after Death, becauſe he is inſenſible of it.</p>
            <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And in Hell he lift up his Eyes being in Torments, and ſeeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his boſom.</hi> As corporal Acts are attributed to God in Scripture, ſo likewiſe to ſeparated Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Hell he lift up his Eyes, being in Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>; Intimating to us, that this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and voluptuous Man had ſtupidly paſt away his Life without any ſerious Thoughts and Conſideration: but now at laſt he was awakened, when it was too late, and began to conſider. <hi>In Hell he lift up his Eyes, being in Torments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O the Stupidity of Sinners! who run on blindly in their Courſe, and never open their Eyes 'till they are fallen into the Pit; who cannot be brought to conſider, 'till Conſideration will do them no good; 'till it ſerve to no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to enrage their Conſciences, and to multiply the Stings of them.</p>
            <p>Thus it was with this Rich Man, <hi>he lift up his Eyes being in Torments, and ſeeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</hi>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:58790:180"/>
Our Saviour repreſents him as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which would then moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably come to his Mind. Feeling his own Miſery, he began to conſider the happy Condition of the poor Man whom he had ſo cruelly neglected. And indeed one great part of the Torment of Hell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in thoſe Reflections which Men ſhall make upon the Happineſs which they have wilfully loſt and neglected, and the Sins whereby they have plunged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into that miſerable State.</p>
            <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And he cried, and ſaid, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and ſend La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, that he may dip the tip of his Finger in Water, and cool my Tongue; for I am tormented in this Flame.</hi> See how the Scene is changed; now he is fain to beg Relief of the Beggar, who had ſued to him in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his Finger in Water, and cool my Tongue.</hi> Here is another very decent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; the Rich Man is repreſented as not having the Face to beg any great Relief from <hi>Lazarus,</hi> towards whom he had been ſo hard-hearted. <hi>To dip the tip of his Finger in Water, to cool his Tongue,</hi> had been a very great Favour from <hi>Lazarus,</hi> to whom the Rich Man
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:58790:181"/>
had denied even the <hi>Crumbs which fell from his Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For I am tormented in this Flame.</hi> The Scripture loves to make uſe of ſenſible Repreſentations, to ſet forth to us the Happineſs and Miſery of the next Life; partly by way of Condeſcenſion to our Underſtandings, and partly to work more powerfully upon our Affections. For whilſt we are in the Body, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd in Senſe, we are moſt apt to be moved by ſuch Deſcriptions of things as are ſenſible; and therefore the Torments of wicked Men in Hell, are uſually in Scripture deſcribed to us, by one of the quickeſt and ſharpeſt Pains that Human Nature is ordinarily acquainted withal, namely, by the pain of Burning; Fire being the moſt active thing in Nature, and therefore capable of cauſing the ſharpeſt Pains.</p>
            <p>But we cannot from theſe and the like Expreſſions of Scripture certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that this is the true and proper Pain of Hell: All that we can infer from theſe Deſcriptions is this, that the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of wicked Men in the other World, ſhall be very terrible, and as great, and probably greater than can poſſibly be deſcribed to us by any thing
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:58790:181"/>
that we are now acquainted withal; for who knows the Power of God's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the utmoſt of what Omnipotent Juſtice can do to Sinners? For as the Glory of Heaven, and the Joys of God's Preſence are now inconceivable; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are the Torments of Hell, and the Miſeries of the Damned. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man,</hi> thoſe dreadful things <hi>which God prepares for them that hate him.</hi> Who can imagine the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſignificancy of thoſe Phraſes which the Scripture uſes to ſet forth this to us, of God's being <hi>a conſuming Fire,</hi> of being <hi>tormented in Flames,</hi> of God's <hi>Wrath and Jealouſy ſmoaking</hi> againſt Sinners, and all the Curſes that are written in his Book, falling upon them? Who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Horror of thoſe Expreſſions, of <hi>the Worm that dies not,</hi> and <hi>the Fire that is not quenched,</hi> of God's <hi>pouring out the Vials of his Wrath,</hi> of being <hi>deliver'd over to the Tormentor,</hi> of being <hi>thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to utter Darkneſs,</hi> of being <hi>caſt into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone</hi>? Theſe forms of Speech ſeem to be borrowed from thoſe things which among Men are moſt dreadful and affrighting, and to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated and accommodated to our Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:58790:182"/>
and not ſo much intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to us the proper and real Torments of Hell, as to convey to us in a more ſenſible and affecting manner the ſenſe of what the Scripture ſays in general, that <hi>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ver. 25. <hi>But Abraham ſaid, Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. Abraham ſaid, Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</hi> It is very obſervable, how our Saviour chuſes to repreſent to us the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Rich Man; tho' there was the greateſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them imaginable, the one was in Heaven, and the other in Hell, yet they treated one another civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Abraham</hi> is brought in giving the common terms of Civility to this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wicked Man, and calling him <hi>Son; Son, remember.</hi> It was indeed a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere thing which he ſaid to him, he put him in mind of his former Proſperity; and of his Fault in his unmerciful Uſage of <hi>Lazarus; Remember, Son, that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things, and Lazarus,</hi> &amp;c. But yet whilſt he ſpeaks ſuch ſharp things to him, he 'bates bad Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:58790:182"/>
A Man may ſay very ſevere things, where a juſt Occaſion requires it; but he muſt uſe no reviling; <hi>rem ipſam dic, mitte male loqui,</hi> ſay the thing, but uſe no bad Language. And this, as one ſays, is the true art of Chiding, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Stile wherein we muſt uſe to reprove. If we do it with Malice, and Anger, and Contempt, it is miſbecoming, even tho' we deſpair of doing good: but if we hope for any good Effect, we are like to miſs of it this way; for as the Apoſtle ſays excellently, <hi>the wrath of Man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some think that <hi>Abraham</hi> gives the Rich Man the Title of <hi>Son</hi> ironically, and by way of Jeer: but without all reaſon. For ſurely there is not ſo much bad Nature in Heaven, as to ſcoff at thoſe who are in Miſery. Beſides that we find our Saviour obſerving this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum of good Language in other of his Parables; as particularly, in that of the King who invited Gueſts to the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his Son, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.11. When the King ſaw there the Man, that came without his Wedding Garment, tho' he paſt a very ſevere Sentence upon him, yet he gives him the common terms of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou hither?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:58790:183"/>This ſhould teach us Chriſtians, how we ought to demean our ſelves towards thoſe who are at the greateſt diſtance from us, and how we ought to behave our ſelves towards one another in the greateſt Differences of Religion. None ſure can be at greater diſtance, than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and the Rich Man in <hi>Hell</hi>; and yet our Saviour would not repreſent them as at terms of Defiance with one another. One might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have reviled this poor Wretch, and diſdain'd to have ſpoken to him: But this is not the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Heaven, nor ought it to be of good Men upon Earth, even towards the worſt of Men.</p>
            <p>How does this condemn our Rudeneſs and Impatience with one another in our religious Differences! We think no Terms bad enough to uſe towards one another: and yet one of the moſt famous Diſputes that we find mentioned in Scripture, and <hi>that</hi> between the moſt oppoſite Parties that can be imagined, was managed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another Faſhion; I mean <hi>that</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by St. <hi>Jude</hi> between <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, and the Devil, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Yet Michael the Archangel, when contending with the Devil, he diſputed about the Body
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:58790:183"/>
of Moſes, durſt not bring a railing Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he durſt not allow himſelf this, no not in the heat of Diſpute, when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are moſt apt to fly out into Paſſion, becauſe it was indecent, and would have been diſpleaſing to God; this I believe is the true reaſon why it is ſaid, <hi>he durſt not bring a railing Accuſation.</hi> And yet I may add another, which is not improper for our Conſideration, I am ſure it hath a good Moral; the Devil would have been too hard for him at railing, he was better skill'd at that Weapon, and more expert at that kind of Diſpute.</p>
            <p>Which Conſideration may be a good Argument to us againſt reviling any Man. If we revile the good, we are unjuſt, becauſe they deſerve it not; if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile the bad, we are unwiſe, becauſe we ſhall get nothing by it. I could almoſt envy the Character which was given of one of the <hi>Romans; Neſcivit quid eſſet male dicere, he knew not what it was to give bad Language.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed <hi>Son remember that thou in thy Life time receivedſt thy good things. Thy good things,</hi> thoſe which thou didſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and eſteem ſo highly, and didſt place thy chief Happineſs in, as if there had been no other good to be ſought after.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:58790:184"/>
               <hi>Thy good things,</hi> and indeed ſo he uſed them, as if he had been the ſole Lord and Proprietor of them, and they had not been committed to him, as a Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, to be diſpenſed for his Maſter's uſe, for the cloathing of the naked, and the feeding of the hungry, and the relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thoſe in diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Ver. 27, 28. <hi>Then he ſaid, I pray thee therefore Father, that thou wouldſt ſend him to my Father's houſe: for I have five Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; that he may teſtifie unto them, leſt they alſo come into this place of Torment.</hi> Here the Rich Man, tho' in Hell, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as retaining ſome tenderneſs for his Relations, as ſolicitous leſt they ſhould be involved in the ſame Miſery with himſelf. The laſt piece of that which commonly remains in Men, is natural Affection, which is not ſo much a Virtue, as a natural Principle, and is common to many brute Beaſts. When a Man puts off this, we may give him up for loſt to all manner of Goodneſs. To be <hi>without natural Affection,</hi> is the worſt Character can be given of a Man. Our Saviour repreſents this Rich Man in Hell as not ſo totally degenerate as to be quite deſtitute of this.</p>
            <p>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ink ſome attribute this Motion of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:58790:184"/>
the Rich Man concerning his Brethren to another Cauſe; as if he had deſired it, not out of kindneſs to them, but out of regard to himſelf, as being afraid that if his Brethen, who probably were corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Example, had periſht by that means, it would have been an Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Torments. But this Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is too ſubtile, and without any good ground; for every Man carries his Burthen of Guilt with him out of this World, and it is not encreaſed by any Conſequence of our actions here. For the Crime of a bad Example is the ſame, whether Men follow it or not, becauſe he that gives bad Example to others, does what in him lies to draw them into Sin; and if they do not follow it, that is no mitigation of his Fault.</p>
            <p>I have but one Obſervation more, and that is from the mention of his <hi>Brethren</hi> as his neareſt Relations, which is a great Aggravation of the Rich Man's Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs, becauſe he is repreſented as having no Children to take care for, and yet he would not conſider the Poor.</p>
            <p>And thus I have, as briefly as I could, endeavour'd to explain this Parable, and have made ſuch Obſervations from the Circumſtances of it, as may be uſeful for
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:58790:185"/>
Inſtruction. But as I premiſed at firſt, I will not warrant all theſe Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be certainly intended by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; I know very well that every Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of a Parable is not to be preſt too far, the Moral Accommodation does chiefly belong to the main Scope of it, and many Circumſtances are only brought in to fill up the Parable, and to make handſomer way for that which is moſt material, and principally intended: But ſo long as the Obſervations are true and uſeful, and have a fair Colour and Occaſion from the Circumſtances, it is well enough; to be ſure there is no harm done. I proceed to the <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort of Obſervations, namely, ſuch as are drawn from the main ſcope and intent of the Parable, which I promiſed to ſpeak more largely to; and they are <hi>Six,</hi> which I ſhall handle in order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I obſerve that Uncharitableneſs and Unmercifulneſs to the Poor, is a great and damning Sin. We find no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fault imputed to the Rich Man but this, that he took no care out of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity and Abundance to relieve this poor Man that lay at his Gate. He is not charged for want of Juſtice, but of Charity; not for having got a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:58790:185"/>
by Fraud or Oppreſſion, but that in the midſt of this Abundance he had no Conſideration and Pity for thoſe that were in want.</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour to make out this Obſervation by the parts of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> That Unmercifulneſs and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs to the Poor is a great Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Such a Sin, as alone and without any other guilt, is ſufficient to ruin a Man for ever. I ſhall ſpeak to theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> That Unmercifulneſs and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs to the Poor is a very great Sin. It contains in its very Nature two black Crimes, Inhumanity and Impiety.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Inhumanity; it is an Argument of a cruel and ſavage Diſpoſition, not to pity thoſe that are in Want and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And he doth not truly pity the Miſeries of others, that doth not relieve them when he hath Ability and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in his Hands. Tenderneſs and Compaſſion for the Sufferings of others is a virtue ſo proper to our Nature, that it is therefore call'd <hi>Humanity,</hi> as if it were eſſential to Human Nature, and as if without this, we did not deſerve the Name of Men. To ſee a Man like our ſelves, <hi>bone of our bone, and fleſh of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:58790:186"/>
our fleſh,</hi> labouring under Want and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and yet not to be moved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate him, this is a ſign that we have put off our own Nature, otherwiſe we ſhould pity the Sufferings of it in others. For whenever we behold a Man like our ſelves groaning under Want, and preſt with Neceſſity, and do not relent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, and are not ready to relieve him, we are hard-hearted to our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and do in ſome ſenſe what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſays <hi>no Man ever did</hi> (that is, none retaining the Temper and Affections of a Man) <hi>hate his own Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the Scripture ſpeaks of as a moſt barbarous ſort of Inhumanity, and calls it Murder, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15. <hi>Whoſo hateth his Brother is a Murderer</hi>; and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our Brother in want is <hi>to hate</hi> him; for this is the Inſtance which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives at the 17<hi>th. verſe, Whoſo hath this worlds Goods, and ſeeth his Brother in want, and ſhutteth up his Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion from him</hi>; whoſo doth not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Poor, is a Man-ſlayer and a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, he is cruel to his own Nature, nay were he ſufficiently ſenſible of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Humane Nature, he is cruel to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Seeſt thou a Poor Man in great Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:58790:186"/>
and Want, there is nothing hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him, but what is common to Man, what might have been thy Lot and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well as his, and what may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to thee or thine another time. Make it therefore thine own Caſe; (for ſo the Providence of God may make it one time or other, and thou provokeſt him to make it ſo ſpeedily, by thy unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſpoſition toward the Poor;) I ſay, make it thine own caſe, if thou wert in the Poor Man's Condition, and he in thine, conſult thine own Bowels, and tell me how thou wouldſt wiſh him to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected toward thee. Wouldſt thou be willing that he ſhould ſlight and repulſe thee, and ſhut up his Bowels of Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from thee? If not, then do not thou deal ſo with him, conſider that it may be thine own caſe, therefore do not thou give the World any bad Example in this kind, do not teach Men to be unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, leſt they learn of thee, and thou find the ill Effects of it, when it comes to be thine own Condition. This is the firſt Aggravation of this Sin, the Inhumanity of it. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides the Inhumanity of this Sin, it is likewiſe a great Impiety toward God. Unmercifulneſs to the Poor hath
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:58790:187"/>
this fourfold Impiety in it; it is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God; an Uſurpation upon his Right; a ſlighting of his Providence; and a plain Demonſtration that we do not love God, and that all our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Religion are hypocritical and inſincere.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a Contempt of God, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching of him; ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.31. <hi>He that oppreſſeth the Poor,</hi> (not only he that dealeth unjuſtly with a Poor Man, but he that is uncharitable towards him, as appears by the Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>but he that honoureth him hath Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on the Poor</hi>; here Oppreſſion of the Poor is oppoſed to want of Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him;) <hi>He that oppreſſeth the Poor reproacheth his Maker</hi>; how is that? He deſpiſeth God who made him after his own Image and Likeneſs: For the Poor Man bears the Image of God as well as the Rich, ſo that thou canſt not oppreſs or neglect him, without ſome reflection upon God, whoſe Image he bears.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The uncharitable Man is an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per upon God's Right. <hi>The Earth is the Lord's, and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> and <hi>he hath given it to the Children of Men,</hi> not abſolutely to diſpoſe of as they pleaſe, but in truſt, and with certain
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:58790:187"/>
reſervations, ſo as to be accountable to him for the diſpoſal of it. In reſpect of other Men, we are indeed true Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of our Eſtates: but in reſpect of God, we are but Stewards; and he will call us to an Account how we have laid them out. So much as we need is ours; but beyond what will ſupport us, and be a convenient Proviſion for our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the Rank wherein God hath placed us, all that is given to us, that we may give it to others. And if God hath been liberal to us in the Bleſſings of this Life, it is on purpoſe to give us an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to engage us to be ſo to others that ſtand in need of our Charity; and we are falſe to our Truſt, if we keep thoſe things to our ſelves, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God for this very end that we might diſtribute them to others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of our Ability and their Neceſſity. This is to hide our Lord's Talent in a Napkin, and that which thou ſtoreſt up in this Caſe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly detained by thee; for God intended it ſhould have been for Bread for the hungry, and for Cloaths for the naked, for the Relief and Support of thoſe who were ready to periſh.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The uncharitable Man is impious
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:58790:188"/>
in ſlighting of God's Providence. He does not conſider that Riches and Poverty are of the Lord, that he can ſoon change our Condition, and that it is an eaſy thing with him to make a Rich Man poor. We do not ſufficiently reverence the Providence which rules the World, if when God hath bleſt us with Plenty and Abundance, we have no pity and regard for thoſe that are in need. God can ſoon turn the Wheel, and lay thee as low as the poor Man whom thou doſt neglect. He can <hi>caſt down the mighty from their Seat, and exalt the humble and meek; fill the hungry with good things, and ſend the rich empty away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God's Providence could eaſily have diſpoſed of things otherwiſe, to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured every man from want: but he hath on purpoſe order'd this variety of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, high and low, rich and poor, not that ſome men might have an Advantage to inſult over and deſpiſe others, but that there might be an Opportunity for the exerciſe of ſeveral Virtues; that the poor might have an Opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their Dependance upon God, and their Patience and Submiſſion to his Will; and that the rich might ſhow their Temperance, and Moderation, and Charity.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:58790:188"/>4. Unmercifulneſs to the Poor is a plain Demonſtration that we do not love God, and that all our other pretences to Religion are hypocritical and inſincere. St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, that <hi>pure Religion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled before God and the Father, is this, to viſit the fatherleſs and the widow,</hi> Ja. 1.27. That <hi>the wiſdom which is from above is full of mercy and good fruits,</hi> ch. 3.17. St. <hi>John</hi> repreſents this uncharitable Diſpoſition as utterly inconſiſtent with the true Love of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.17. <hi>But whoſo hath this world's goods, and ſeeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of Compaſſion from him; how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> In vain does ſuch a Man pretend to love God; nay <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 20. he tells us that it is impoſſible ſuch a Man ſhould love God. <hi>If a man ſay I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> This deſerves to be ſeriouſly conſider'd by thoſe who make a great ſhew of Devotion, and are at great pains in Prayer, and Faſting, and reading, and hearing the Word of God, and in all other frugal Exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which ſtand them in no Money; leſt all their Labour be loſt for want of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:58790:189"/>
this one neceſſary and eſſential part, leſt with the Young Man in the Goſpel, after they have kept all other Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they be rejected by Chriſt for lack of <hi>this one thing.</hi> I have done with the firſt part of the Obſervation, That Unmercifulneſs is a very great Sin. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d,</hi> That it is ſuch a Sin, as alone, and without any other Guilt, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ruin a Man for ever. The Parable lays the Rich Man's Condemnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this; it was the guilt of this Sin that tormented him when he was in Hell. The Scripture is full of ſevere Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt this Sin. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Whoſo ſtoppeth his Ears at the cry of the Poor, he alſo ſhall cry himſelf, but ſhall not be heard.</hi> God will have no regard or pity for the Man that regardeth not the Poor. That is a terrible Text, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.13. <hi>He ſhall have Judgment without Mercy, that hath ſhewed no Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour hath two Parables to repreſent to us the Danger of this Sin; this here in the Text, and that in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. concerning the Covetous Man that enlarged his Barns, and was ſtill laying up, but laid nothing out upon the Poor; upon which our Saviour makes this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:58790:189"/>
which is the Moral of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>So is he that layeth up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for himſelf, and is not rich towards God</hi>; So ſhall he be, ſuch an iſſue of his Folly may every one expect, who lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up Treaſure for himſelf, but does not lay up Riches with God. How is that? The Scripture tells us, by Works of Mercy and Charity; this our Saviour calls <hi>laying up for our ſelves Treaſures in Heaven, Matth.</hi> 6.20. And <hi>Luke</hi> 12.33. he calls giving of Alms, <hi>providing for our ſelves Bags that wax not old, a Treaſure in Heaven that faileth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no particular Grace and Virtue to which the Promiſe of eternal Life is ſo frequently made in Scripture, as to this of Mercy and Charity to the Poor. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Bleſſed are the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for they ſhall find Mercy.</hi> Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as it does not exclude a Reward in this world, ſo it ſeems principally to reſpect the Mercy of God at the great Day. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.12, 13, 14 <hi>When thou makeſt a Feaſt, invite not the Rich, for they will recompence thee again: but invite the Poor, and the maimed, and the lame, and the blind, for they cannot recompenſe thee; but thou ſhalt be recompenſed at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Juſt.</hi> Luke 16.9. <hi>Make
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:58790:190"/>
therefore to your ſelves friends of the Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, that when ye ſhall fail, they may receive you into everlaſting habitations.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17, 18, 19. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good Foundation,</hi> as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is ſometimes uſed, <hi>a good Treaſure againſt the time which is to come, that they may lay hold of eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the moſt conſiderable Text of all other to this purpoſe, is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. where our Saviour gives us a deſcription of the Judgment of the Great Day: And if that be a true and proper repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the proceſs of that Day, then the grand enquiry will be, what Works of Charity have been done or neglected by us, and accordingly Sentence ſhall be paſt upon us.</p>
            <p>The proper Reſult from all this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is to perſuade Men to this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Duty. Our eternal Happineſs does not ſo much depend upon the exerciſe of any one ſingle Grace or Virtue, as this of Charity and Mercy. Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are more general and fundamental
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:58790:190"/>
Graces, and as it were the Parents of all the reſt: But of all ſingle Virtues the Scripture lays the greateſt weight upon this of Charity; and if we do truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Precepts of the Goſpel, and the Promiſes and Threatnings of it, we cannot but have a principal regard to it.</p>
            <p>I know how averſe Men generally are to this Duty, which makes them ſo full of Excuſes and Objections againſt it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They have Children to provide for. This is not the caſe of all, and they whoſe caſe it is, may do well to conſider, that it will not be amiſs to leave a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as well as an Inheritance to their Children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They tell us, they intend to do ſomething when they die. I doubt that very much; but granting their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be real, why ſhould Men chuſe to ſpoil a good Work, and to take away the Grace and Acceptableneſs of it, by the manner of doing? It ſhews a great backwardneſs to the Work, when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it as long as we can. He that will not do good, till he be enforced by the laſt neceſſity, <hi>diu noluit,</hi> was long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing. It is one of the worſt Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we can put upon God, to give a thing to him when we can keep it no longer.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:58790:191"/>3. Others ſay they may come to want themſelves, and it is Prudence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt that. To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) I believe that no Man ever came the ſooner to want for his Charity. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> hath an expreſs Obſervatinn to the contrary, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 37.25. <hi>I have been young and now am old, yet have I not ſeen the righteous forſaken, nor his Seed begging bread.</hi> And tho' he uſe a general word, yet that by the <hi>righteous</hi> here he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>merciful Man,</hi> is evident from the next words, <hi>he is ever merciful and lendeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides <hi>David</hi>'s Obſervation, we have expreſs Promiſes of God to ſecure us againſt this Fear. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.1, 2. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that conſidereth the poor, the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble, the Lord will preſerve him and keep him alive, and he ſhall be bleſſed upon the Earth.</hi> Pro. 28.27. <hi>He that giveth unto the Poor ſhall not lack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Thou mayeſt come to want tho' thou give nothing; thou may'ſt loſe that which thou haſt ſpared in this kind as well as the reſt; thou may'ſt loſe all, and then thou art no better ſecured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt want, than if thou hadſt been charitable. Beſides that, when thou art brought to Poverty, thou wilt
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:58790:191"/>
want the Comfort of having done this Duty, and may'ſt juſtly look upon the neglect of this Duty as one of the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thy Poverty.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) After all our Care to provide for our ſelves, we muſt truſt the Providence of God; and a Man can in no caſe ſo ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>commit himſelf to God</hi> as <hi>in well doing.</hi> If the Providence of God (as we all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) be peculiarly concern'd to bleſs one Man more than another, I dare ſay the charitable Man will not have the leaſt Portion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a worſe Objection than all theſe made by ſome grave Men, who would be glad under a pretence of Piety to ſlip themſelves out of this Duty; and that is this, that it ſavours of Popery to preſs good Works with ſo much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon Men, as if we could merit Heaven by them; So that they dare not be charitable out of a pious Fear, as they pretend, leſt hereby they ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Doctrine of Merit.</p>
            <p>But if the Truth were known, I doubt Covetouſneſs lyes at the bottom of this Objection: However it is fit it ſhould be anſwered. And,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) I ſay that no Man that is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced either by his Education or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:58790:192"/>
can think that a Creature can me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit any thing at the hand of God, to whom all that we can poſſibly do, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently due; much leſs that we can merit ſo great a Reward as that of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Tho we deny the merit of good Works, yet we firmly believe the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of them to Eternal Life. And that they are neceſſary to Eternal Life, is as good an Argument to perſwade a wiſe Man to do them, as if they were meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious; unleſs a Man be ſo vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to think Heaven not worth the having unleſs he purchaſe it himſelf at a valuable Conſideration.</p>
            <p>And now let me earneſtly intreat you, as you love God and your own Souls, not to neglect this Duty; leſt you bring your ſelves to the ſame miſerable ſtate with this Rich Man, to whom the leaſt Charity that could be askt was denied. Our Saviour hath purpoſely left this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable on record, to be a teſtimony and a witneſs to us; leſt we being guilty of the ſame ſin, <hi>ſhould come into the ſame place of torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any ask me according to what proportion of his Eſtate he ought to be charitable? I cannot determine that.
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:58790:192"/>
Only, let no Man neglect his Duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot (and it may be no one elſe can) tell him the exact proportion of his Charity to his Eſtate. There are ſome Duties that are ſtrictly determined, as thoſe of Juſtice; but God hath left our Charity to be <hi>a free will Offering.</hi> In the proportion of this Duty, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one muſt determine himſelf by Prudence and the Love of God: God hath left this Duty undetermined, to try the largeneſs of our Hearts towards him; only to encourage us to be <hi>abundant in this Grace,</hi> he hath promiſed, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhall be the degree of our Happineſs; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 6. <hi>He that ſoweth plentifully, ſhall reap plentifully.</hi> But let us be ſure to do ſomething in this kind; any part of our Eſtate rather than none.</p>
            <p>I will conclude with that excellent Counſel of the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> Eccl. 4. <hi>My Son defraud not the Poor, and make not the needy Eye to wait long; make not a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Soul ſorrowful, neither provoke a Man in his diſtreſs; add not more trouble to a Heart that is vexed, defer not to give to him that is in need. Reject not the ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the afflicted, nor turn away thy face from a poor Man; turn not away thy Eye
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:58790:193"/>
from the needy, and give him none occaſion to curſe thee. For if he curſe thee in the bitterneſs of his Soul, his Prayer ſhall be heard of him that made him. Let it not grieve thee to bow down thine Ear to the poor, and give him a friendly anſwer with meekneſs. Be as a father to the fatherleſs, and inſtead of a husband to their mother; ſo ſhalt thou be as the Son of the moſt high, and he ſhall love thee more than thy Mother doth.</hi>

                  </bibl>
                  <p>There was a certain Rich Man, which was cloathed in Purple and fine Linen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day: And there was a certain Beggar, named Lazarus, which was laid at his Gate full of Sores.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Proceed to our <hi>Second</hi> Obſervation, that a Man may be poor and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this World, and yet dear to God. This beggar <hi>Lazarus,</hi> tho' he was ſo much ſlighted, and deſpiſed in his life-time by this great Rich Man, yet it appeared when he came to die, that he was not neglected by God, for <hi>he gave his Angels charge concerning him,</hi> to convey him to Happineſs; <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>The
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:58790:194"/>
Beggar died, and was carried into Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's boſom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Truth is not only repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in a Parable, but exemplified in the Life of our bleſſed Saviour. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any Man ſo dear to God as he was, for he was <hi>his only begotten Son, his beloved Son, in whom he was well pleaſed:</hi> And yet how poor and mean was his Condition in this World! Inſomuch that the <hi>Jews</hi> were offended at him, and could not own one that appeared in ſo much Meanneſs, for the true Meſſias. He was born of mean Parents, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted as ſoon as he was born; he was deſtitute of worldly Accommodations, <hi>The Foxes had holes, and the Birds of the Air had neſts; but the Son of Man had not where to lay his head. He was deſpiſed and rejected of Men, a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God could have ſent his Son into the World with Majeſty and great Glory, and have made all the Kings of the Earth to have bowed before him, and paid Homage to him: but the Wiſdom of God choſe rather that he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a poor and humble, in a ſuffering and afflicted Condition, to confound the Pride of the World, who meaſure
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:58790:194"/>
the Love of God by theſe outward things, and think that God hates all thoſe whom he permits to be afflicted.</p>
            <p>Now it was not poſſible to give a greater and clearer Demonſtration of this Truth, that Goodneſs and Suffering may meet together in the ſame Perſon, than in the Son of God, <hi>who did no Sin, neither was Guile found in his mouth; yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and to put him to Grief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afflictions in this world are ſo far from being a ſign of God's Hatred, that they are an Argument of his Love and Care; <hi>whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> Thoſe he deſigns for great things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, he trains up by great Hardſhips in this world, and by many Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons prepares them for a Kingdom. This courſe God took more eſpecially in the firſt planting of Chriſtianity; the <hi>poor</hi> chiefly were thoſe that <hi>received the Goſpel. Not many mighty, nor many noble; but the baſe things of the world, and the things that were deſpiſed did God chuſe. Hearken, my beloved brethren,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> ch. 2.5. <hi>Hath not God choſen the poor in this world, rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:58790:195"/>Now this Conſideration ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade to Patience under the greateſt Sufferings and Afflictions in this world. God may be our Father, and chaſten us ſeverely; nay this very thing is rather an Argument that he is ſo. God may love us tho' the world hate us. 'Tis but exerciſing a little Patience, and theſe Storms will blow over, and we ſhall be removed into a calmer Region, where <hi>all tears ſhall be wiped from our eyes; and death and ſorrow ſhall be no more.</hi> This was the Portion of the Son of God here; but <hi>it is a faithful ſaying, that if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him, if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him.</hi> Therefore thoſe who ſuffer in this world ought not to be moved, <hi>as tho ſome ſtrange thing hapned unto them; but ſhould rather rejoice, in as much as they are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Chriſt's ſufferings, that when his glory ſhall be revealed, they alſo may be glad with exceeding joy,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.12, 13. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> Obſervation, which is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Eſtate of good and bad men after this life; <hi>Lazarus died, and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's boſom: the rich man died, and went to hell.</hi> This the Juſtice of the Divine Providence ſeems
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:58790:195"/>
to require; ſo that if there had been no Revelation of God to this purpoſe, it is a thing very credible to Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whether we conſider God or our ſelves. If we conſider God; our Reaſon tells us, that he is the holy and righteous Governor of the World, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that he loves Goodneſs and hates Sin, and therefore is concern'd to countenance the one, and diſcountenance the other, in ſuch a ſolemn and publick manner, as may vindicate his Holineſs and Juſtice to the whole World. Now the Diſpenſations of his Providence are promiſcuous in this world; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems very reaſonable, that there ſhould be a general Aſſizes, a fair and open Trial; when <hi>God will render to every Man according to his works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we conſider our ſelves, this will appear very credible; for this hath been the conſtant Opinion, not only of the common People, but of the wiſeſt Perſons, who had only the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to guide them. Nay if we do but ſearch our own Conſciences, we ſhall find an inward and ſecret acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this, in that inward peace and ſatisfaction we find in any good Action, and in that ſhame and fear and horror
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:58790:196"/>
that haunts a Man after the commiſſion of any, tho' never ſo ſecret a Sin.</p>
            <p>And as Reaſon and Scripture together do aſſure us of a future Judgment; ſo likewiſe, that Men, when they paſs out of this world, ſhall meet with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Conſequences and Rewards of their Actions in the other. And tho' the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery of Men be not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as it ſhall be after the publick Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet it is unſpeakably great. <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> is repreſented as very happy immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after his paſſing out of this world, he is ſaid to be <hi>carried into Abraham's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom</hi>; by which the <hi>Jews</hi> expreſs the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the future State. And the Rich Man is repreſented, as in great Anguiſh and <hi>Torment.</hi> But what the Happineſs of good Men, and the Miſery of wicked Men ſhall be in the other State, we can but now imperfectly and unskilfully deſcribe.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Fourth</hi> Obſervation, the vaſt differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Men's Conditions in this world, and the other. The Rich Man proſpered here, and was afterward tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented: <hi>Lazarus</hi> was poor and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this world, and happy in the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:58790:196"/>
other; <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedſt thy good things and</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus <hi>evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> And it is very agreeable to the Wiſdom of God, to make ſuch a difference between Mens Conditions in this World and the other; and that for theſe <hi>two</hi> Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> For the trying of Mens Virtue.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> In order to the Recompencing of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Tryal of Men's Virtue. For this End principally God ordains the Sufferings of Good Men, and permits the beſt of his Servants many times to be involved in the greateſt Calamities to try their Faith in him, and Love to him; to improve their Virtue, and to prevent thoſe Sins into which the mighty Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of a perpetual Proſperity are apt to draw even the beſt of Men; to take off their Affections from the love of this vain World, and to engage and fix them there, where they ſhall never repent that they have placed them; to prove their Sincerity towards God, and to exerciſe their Patience and Submiſſion to his Will; to prepare them for the Glory of the next Life, and to make the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:58790:197"/>
Happineſs of Heaven more welcome to them, when they ſhall come to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> In order to the Recompencing of Men; that they who will take up with the Pleaſures and Enjoyments of this preſent world, and take no care for their future State, that they who will gratify their Senſes, and neglect their immortal Souls, may inherit the proper Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of their wretched Choice. And on the other hand, that they who love God above all things, and had rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the greateſt Evils, than do the leaſt, that they who look beyond the preſent Scene of things, and believe the reality and Eternity of the other State, and live accordingly, may not be diſappointed in their Hopes, and ſerve God, and ſuffer for him for nothing. From this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Difference between the Condition of Men in this world and the other, we may infer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That no Man ſhould meaſure his Felicity or Unhappineſs by his Lot in this world. If thou receiveſt thy good things, art rich and honourable, and haſt as much of the things of this world as thine Heart can wiſh, art ſplendidly attired, and <hi>fareſt ſumptuouſly every day</hi>; art <hi>in no trouble like other Men, neither
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:58790:197"/>
art plagued like other folk</hi>; do not upon this bleſs thy ſelf as the happy Man. On the other hand, art thou poor and miſerable, deſtitute of all the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences and Accommodations of this Life? Do not repine at thy Lot, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at God for having dealt hardly with thee. No Man can be pronounced hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or miſerable for what befals him in this Life; <hi>no Man knows Love or Hatred by theſe things</hi>; this Life is but a ſhort and inconſiderable duration, and it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much what Entertainment we meet withal, as we are paſſing through this world: The ſtate of Eternity is that wherein the Happineſs or Miſery of Men ſhall be determined. He is the happy Man who is ſo in that Life which ſhall never have an end; and he is miſerable that ſhall be ſo for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhould not ſet too great a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon the bleſſings of this Life. We may <hi>receive our good things</hi> here, and <hi>be tormented</hi> hereafter; nay this very thing will be no inconſiderable part of our Torment, none of the leaſt Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of our Miſery, that we <hi>did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our good things.</hi> Nothing afflicts a Man more, and toucheth him more ſenſibly when he is in Miſery, than the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:58790:198"/>
remembrance of his former Proſperity; had he never been happy, his Miſery would be the leſs.</p>
            <p>Therefore we ſhould be ſo far from applauding our ſelves in the Proſperity of this World, that we ſhould rather be afraid of <hi>receiving our good things</hi> here; leſt God ſhould put us off with theſe things, and this ſhould be all our Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and leſt our Miſery in the next World ſhould be the greater for our having been happy.</p>
            <p>The Felicities of this World are Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, and tho' our Happineſs were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo compleat, yet it is going off, and paſſing away; and when it is gone and paſt, if Miſery ſucceed it, it had better never have been. <hi>Remember, thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things</hi>; theſe things are only for our <hi>life time,</hi> and how ſhort is that! Did Men ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, they would not ſet ſuch a price upon any of the tranſient Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Life, as for the ſake of them to neglect the great Concernments of another World. We are apt to be dazled with the preſent glittering of worldly Glory and Proſperity: But if we would look upon theſe things as they will be ſhortly gone from us, how
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:58790:198"/>
little would they ſignifie! The Rich Man here in the Parable did, no doubt, think himſelf a much happier Man than poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> that lay at his Door; and yet after a little while how glad would he have been to have changed Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with this poor Man! When he was <hi>in Torments,</hi> then no doubt he wiſht that he had ſuffered all the miſery and want in this world which <hi>Lazarus</hi> did, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he might have been <hi>comforted</hi> as he was, and <hi>carried by Angels into Abraham's boſom.</hi> We ſhould value this world, and look upon it, as this Rich Man did, not when he enjoyed it, but when he was taken from it; and we ſhould eſteem it and uſe it while we may, as he wiſht he had done when it was too late.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhould not be exceſſively troubled, if we meet with hardſhip and affliction here in this world; becauſe thoſe whom God deſigns for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs hereafter, may receive <hi>evil things</hi> here. Thus our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>the Captain of our Salvation, was made perfect through Sufferings:</hi> this was the method which God uſed towards his own Son, firſt <hi>he ſuffered, and</hi> then <hi>entred into glory.</hi> He ſuffered more than any of us
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:58790:199"/>
can bear; and yet he ſupported himſelf under all his Sufferings by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Glory that would follow; <hi>for the Joy that was ſet before him, he endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Conſideration ſhould arm us with Patience and Conſtancy under the greateſt Evils of this life. The Evils that we lie under are paſſing and going off; but the Happineſs is to come. And if the Happineſs of the next World were no greater, nor of longer continuance, than the Miſeries of this World; or if they did equally anſwer one another; yet a wiſe Man would chuſe to have Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery firſt, and his Happineſs laſt. For if his Happineſs were firſt, all the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Comfort of it would be eaten out, by diſmal Apprehenſions of what was to follow: but his Sufferings, if they were firſt, would be ſweetned by the conſideration of his future Happineſs; and the bitterneſs of his Sufferings would give a quicker Reliſh to his Happineſs when it ſhould come, and make it greater.</p>
            <p>But a good Man under the Sufferings of this life, hath not only this Comfort, that his Happineſs is to come, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that it ſhall be infinitely greater
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:58790:199"/>
than his Sufferings; that theſe are but ſhort, but that ſhall never have an end. And this was that which fortified the firſt Chriſtians againſt all that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Cruelty of the World could do againſt them. They thought themſelves well paid, if <hi>through many Tribulations they might</hi> at laſt <hi>enter into the Kingdom of God</hi>; becauſe they believed that the Joys of the next life would abundantly recompence all their Labours and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in this World. They expected a mighty Reward far beyond all their Sufferings; they were firmly perſwaded that they ſhould be vaſt Gainers at the laſt. So the Apoſtle tells us of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>I reckon that the Sufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>Our light Afflictions, which are but for a moment, work for us an eternal weight of Glory, whilſt we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen; for the things which are ſeen are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but the things which are not ſeen are eternal.</hi> If we would conſider all things together, and fix our Eyes as much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Happineſs and Glory of the next World, as upon the Pomp and Splendor
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:58790:200"/>
of this, if we would look as much at <hi>the things which are not ſeen,</hi> as <hi>the things which are ſeen,</hi> we ſhould eaſily perceive, that he who ſuffers in this world does not renounce his Happineſs, only puts it out to Intereſt, upon terms of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Advantage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſhould do all things with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to our future and eternal State. It matters not much what our Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in this world, becauſe that's to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue but for a little while: but we ought to have a great and ſerious Regard to that State that never ſhall have an end. Therefore whenever we are doing any thing, we ſhould conſider what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence ſuch an Action will have upon the Happineſs or Miſery of the next Life. We ſhould meaſure every Action, and every Condition of our Lives by the reference of them to Eternity. To be rich and great in this world will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing to our future Happineſs; all theſe things which we ſo much dote upon, and purſue with ſo much eagerneſs, will not commend any Man to God; they will ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when we come to appear before our Judge. Death will ſtrip us of theſe things, and in the other world, the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:58790:200"/>
Soul of the pooreſt Man that ever lived ſhall be upon equal Terms with the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Nothing but Holineſs and Virtue will then avail us; and it is but a little while and we ſhall all certainly be of this Mind, that the beſt thing Men can do in this world, is to provide for the other. I proceed to a</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth</hi> Obſervation, that the State of Men in the next world is fixt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable; which I ground upon <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>Between us and you there is a great gulf fixt, ſo that they that would paſs from hence to you cannot, neither can they paſs to us that would come from thence.</hi> By which words our Saviour ſeems not only to intend, that they that are in Heaven and Hell can have no Communication and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with one another; but likewiſe that they are lodg'd in an immutable State. Thoſe that are happy are like to continue ſo; and thoſe that are miſerable are immutably fixt in that State.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to thoſe that are in Happineſs there can be no great doubt. For what can tempt Men that have ſo narrowly ſcap'd the Dangers and Temptations of a wicked world, and are poſſeſt of ſo great a Happineſs by the free Grace and Mercy of God, to do any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:58790:201"/>
they may forfeit their Happineſs; or ſo much as to entertain a Thought of offending that God, to whom they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſenſible how infinitely they are obliged. In this Imperfect ſtate few Men have ſo little Goodneſs as to ſin without a Temptation; but in that ſtate where Men are perfectly good, and can have no Temptation to be otherwiſe, it is not imaginable that they ſhould fall from that ſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the ſtate of the damned, that <hi>that</hi> likewiſe is immutable the Scripture does ſeem plainly enough to aſſert, when it calls it <hi>an everlaſting Deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> and uſes ſuch Expreſſions to ſet forth the continuance of their Miſery, as ſignifie the longeſt and moſt interminable Duration, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of as great an Extent as thoſe which are uſed to ſignifie the Eternal Happineſs of the bleſſed; and as large and unlimited, as any are to be had in thoſe Languages wherein the Scriptures are written.</p>
            <p>Beſides that wicked Men in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World are in Scripture repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in the ſame Condition with the Devils, of whom there is no ground to believe that any of them ever did or will
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:58790:201"/>
repent. Not becauſe Repentance is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in its own nature to thoſe that are in extream Miſery; but becauſe there is no place left for it. Being under an irreverſible Doom, there is no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Repentance, no hope of Mercy and Pardon, without which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is impoſſible. For if a Man did utterly deſpair of Pardon, and were aſſured upon good ground, that God would never ſhew Mercy to him, in this caſe a Man would grow deſperate, and not care what he did. He that knows that whatever he does, he is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and undone, will not matter how he demeans himſelf. All motives to Repentance are gone after a Man once knows it will be to no purpoſe. And this the Scripture ſeems to repreſent to us, as the caſe of the Devils and damned Spirits. Becauſe their ſtate is finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and they are concluded under an irreverſible Sentence, therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is impoſſible to them.</p>
            <p>Sorry, no doubt, they are, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily troubled that by their own Sin and Folly they have brought this Miſery upon themſelves, and they cannot but conceive an everlaſting Diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, for having been the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:58790:202"/>
Cauſe and Authors of their own Ruin; and the Reflection of this will be a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Spring of diſcontent, and fill their Minds with eternal rage and vexation; and ſo long as they feel the intolerable Puniſhments of Sin, and groan under the inſupportable Torments of it, and ſee no end of this miſerable ſtate, no hope of getting out of it, they can be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe affected, than with diſcontent at themſelves, and rage and fury againſt God.</p>
            <p>They are indeed penitent ſo far, as to be troubled at themſelves for what they have done; but this Trouble works no change and alteration in them; they ſtill hate God who inflicts theſe Puniſhments upon them, and who they believe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to continue them in this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate. The preſent anguiſh of their Condition, and their deſpair of bettering it, makes them mad; and their Minds are ſo diſtracted by the wildneſs of their Paſſions, and their ſpirits ſo exaſperated and ſet on fire by their own giddy Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that there can be no reſt and ſilence in their Souls, not ſo much as the liberty of one calm and ſedate Thought.</p>
            <p>Or if at any time they reflect upon the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:58790:202"/>
evil of their Sins, and ſhould entertain any thoughts of returning to God and their Duty, they are preſently checkt with this Conſideration, that their caſe is determined, that God is implacably offended with them, and is inexorably and peremptorily reſolved to make them miſerable for ever; and during this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, no Man can return to the love of God and Goodneſs, without which there can be no Repentance.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration, of the immutable ſtate of Men after this Life, ſhould engage us with all ſeriouſneſs and diligence to endeavour to ſecure our future happineſs. God hath <hi>ſet before us good and evil, life and death,</hi> and we may yet <hi>chuſe</hi> which we pleaſe; but in the other world, we muſt ſtand to that choice which we have made here, and inherit the Conſequences of it.</p>
            <p>By Sin Mankind is brought into a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſtate; but our Condition is not deſperate and paſt Remedy. God hath ſent his Son <hi>to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> So that tho' our Caſe be bad, it need not continue ſo, if it be not our own fault. There is a poſſibility now of changing our Condition for the better,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:58790:203"/>
and of laying the foundation of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Happineſs for our ſelves. The Grace of God calls upon us, and is ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt us; ſo that no Man's Caſe is ſo bad, but there is a poſſibility of bettering it, if we be not wanting to our ſelves, and will make uſe of the Grace which God offers, who is never wanting to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere endeavours of Men. Under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and Aſſiſtance of this Grace, thoſe who are <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> may <hi>paſs from death to life,</hi> may be <hi>turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> So long as we are in this world there is a poſſibility of being tranſlated from one ſtate to another, from the <hi>dominion of Satan, into the kingdom of God's dear Son.</hi> But if we neglect the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of this life, and ſtand out againſt the offers of God's Grace and Mercy, there will no Overtures be made to us in the other world. After this life is ended, God will try us no more; our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſcarriage in this world will prove fatal to us in the other, and we ſhall not be permitted to live over again to correct our Errors. <hi>As the Tree falls, ſo it ſhall lye</hi>; ſuch a State as we are ſettled in, when we go out of this world, ſhall be fixt in the other, and there will be
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:58790:203"/>
no poſſibility of changing it. We are yet <hi>in the hand of our own Counſel,</hi> and by God's Grace we may mould and faſhion our own Fortune. But if we trifle away this Advantage, we ſhall <hi>fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the living God,</hi> out of which there is no Redemption. God hath yet left Heaven and Hell to our choice, and we had need to look about us, and chuſe well, who can chuſe but once for all and for ever. There is yet a ſpace and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity left us of Repentance; but ſo ſoon as we ſtep out of this Life, and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the other world, our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be ſealed, never to be reverſt. And becauſe after this Life there will be no further hopes of Mercy, there will be no poſſibility of Repentance. <hi>This is the accepted time, this is the day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; therefore to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts; leſt God ſwear in his Wrath that we ſhall not enter into his reſt.</hi> I proceed to a</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixth</hi> Obſervation, That a ſtanding Revelation of God is Evidence ſufficient for Divine things. <hi>They have Moſes, and the Prophets, let them hear them</hi>; that is, they have the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, written by Men divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, theſe do ſufficiently declare to
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:58790:204"/>
them the Will of God and their Duty; and it is unreaſonable to demand or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God ſhould do more for their Conviction and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>I know very well the Text ſpeaks on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thoſe of the New being not then extant, when this Parable was deliver'd. But what is here ſaid concerning the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applicable to the New; and tho' <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> do only recommend <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets,</hi> there is no doubt but he would have ſaid the ſame concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his Apoſtles,</hi> if the Books of the New Teſtament had been then extant. So that what I ſhall ſay upon this Obſervation, does indifferently concern the whole Scripture.</p>
            <p>And that I may make out this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation more fully, I ſhall take theſe <hi>Five</hi> things into conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> What we are to underſtand by a Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Give a brief Account of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Shew what Advantage this ſtanding Revelation of the Scriptures hath above any other way of conveying the will of God to the world.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:58790:204"/>4<hi>thly,</hi> That there is ſufficient Evidence for the divinity of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> That it is unreaſonable to expect that God ſhould do more for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, than to afford ſuch a ſtanding Revelation of his Mind and Will. I ſhall go over theſe as briefly as I can. I begin with the</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> What we are to underſtand by a Divine Revelation. By a divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation we are to underſtand <hi>a ſupernatural diſcovery, or manifeſtation of any thing to us</hi>; I ſay <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> becauſe it may either be immediately by God; or by the mediation of Angels, as moſt, if not all the Revelations of the Old Teſtament were. <hi>A ſupernatural Diſcovery or Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation,</hi> either immediately to our Minds, by our Underſtandings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Faculties; (for I do not ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the diſtinction between Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Imagination, as to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to take notice of it,) or elſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to our Underſtandings by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of our outward Senſes, as by an external appearance to our Bodily Eyes; or by a Voice and Sound to the Senſe of Hearing. <hi>A Diſcovery or Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of a thing,</hi> whether it be ſuch as cannot be known at all by the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:58790:205"/>
uſe of our natural Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; or ſuch as may be diſcovered by natural Light, but is more clearly revealed or made known, or we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened to a more particular and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conſideration of it. For it is not at all unſuitable to the wiſdom of God, to make a <hi>ſupernatural Diſcovery</hi> to us of ſuch things as may be known by the light of Nature, either to give us a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er manifeſtation of ſuch Truths as were more obſcurely known, and did as it were lie buried in our Underſtandings; or elſe to quicken our Minds to a more ſerious and lively conſideration of thoſe Truths.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> For the ſeveral kinds of Divine Revelation. That they were various, the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, <hi>ch.</hi> 1.1. <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral manners, ſpake to the Fathers by the Prophets</hi>; where by <hi>Prophets</hi> we are to underſtand not only thoſe who did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel future things; but any Perſon that was divinely inſpired, and to whom God was pleaſed to make any ſupernatural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now the ſeveral Kinds of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken notice of by the <hi>Jews,</hi> are Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; Dreams; Prophecy; Oracle; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:58790:205"/>
or that which they call the Holy Ghoſt; voice <hi>Bath-col</hi>; or that which was the higheſt of all, which they call <hi>gradus Moſaicus,</hi> the degree of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which was peculiar to <hi>Moſes.</hi> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, eſpecially <hi>Maimonides,</hi> have many ſubtil Obſervations about the differences of theſe ſeveral kinds of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which depends upon ſubtil and Philoſophical Diſtinctions of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Perception; as that ſome of theſe Revelations were by impreſſion only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Underſtanding; ſome only upon the Imagination; ſome upon both; ſome upon the outward Senſes: But the ſimple and plain difference between them, ſo far as there is any ground in Scripture to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them, ſeems to be this; Viſion was a Repreſentation of ſomething to a Man, when he was waking, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Dreams, which were Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made to Men in their Sleep. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy might be either Dream or Viſion, and the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerve that it was always one of theſe two ways, which they grounded upon <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my ſelf known to him in a Viſion, and will ſpeak unto him in a Dream.</hi> But Prophecy in the ſtrict Notion of it, had this peculiarly belonging to it, that it
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:58790:206"/>
was not only monitory or inſtructive, but did foretel ſome Event of Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to others; and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors tell us, that it was a clearer Revelation, and carried greater aſſurance along with it; and that this was common to all the three, that there was ſomething of Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and Tranſport of Mind in all theſe.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſort of Revelation, which was by Oracle, which is call'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> was a rendring of Anſwers to Queſtions, by the High-Prieſt looking upon the Stones in the Breaſt-plate, which how it was done, is uncertain.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſort of Revelation is that which they call the Holy Ghoſt, which was a more calm and gentle Inſpiration, without any extraordinary Tranſport of Mind or Extaſie; ſuch as <hi>David</hi> had in the writing of the <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The loweſt of all was that which they call'd <hi>Bath col,</hi> which was by a Voice from Heaven; and this is the way of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved did only continue among them from the days of the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> to our Saviour.</p>
            <p>The higheſt of all was that which they call'd <hi>gradus Moſaicus,</hi> to which the <hi>Jews</hi> give ſeveral Prerogatives above all the other ways of Revelation; as that it was done by Impreſſion merely upon
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:58790:206"/>
the Underſtanding, without Extaſie, or Rapture, or Tranſport, when he was waking, and in his ordinary Temper, and his Senſes not bound up either by Extaſie or Sleep, that it was a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation immediately from God himſelf, and not by the Mediation of Angels; without any Fear, or Amazement, or Fainting, which was incident to other Prophets; and the Spirit of Prophecy reſted upon him, and he could exert it arbitrarily, and put it forth when he would. Of which thus much is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true from the Story of him, that the Spirit of Prophecy did reſt more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon him, and that he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert it with greater freedom, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſcernable Amazement or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport from his ordinary Temper. But that it was by Impreſſion merely upon his Underſtanding, as <hi>that</hi> is a diſtinct Faculty from the Imagination, is not ſo certain; that it was always by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Communication from God, without the mediation of Angels, ſeems not to be true; for St. <hi>Stephen</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Law was given by the diſpoſition of Angels,</hi> Acts 7.53. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>it was ordained by the Angels in the hand of a Mediator,</hi> that is <hi>Moſes, Gal.</hi> 3.19.
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:58790:207"/>
But that the Revelation which was made to him, had ſome ſingular Prerogatives above thoſe of other Prophets, is plain from Scripture, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.5, 6, 7, 8, when <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> contended with <hi>Moſes</hi> as being equal to him, God tells them that there was a vaſt difference between him and other Prophets; <hi>Hear now my Words, if there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my ſelf known unto him in a Viſion, and will ſpeak unto him in a Dream. My Servant Moſes is not ſo—With him will I ſpeak Mouth to Mouth, even appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and not in dark Speeches,</hi> &amp;c. Ex. 33.11. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes face to face, as a Man ſpeaketh unto his Friend.</hi> Deut. 34.10. <hi>And there aroſe not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſince in Iſrael like unto Moſes, whom the Lord knew face to face.</hi> All which ſignify at leaſt this, that God made the cleareſt, and moſt familiar, and moſt perfect Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries to <hi>Moſes</hi> of any of the Prophets; only our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom God hath diſcovered his Will to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament, did excel <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; Moſes</hi> being but <hi>a faithful Servant</hi> that is, <hi>humilis amicus,</hi> a meaner ſort of Friend; but <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the only begotten Son of God,</hi> who came from <hi>the boſom of his Father,</hi> and was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with the ſecrets of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:58790:207"/>
his Will, and <hi>had not the Spirit given him by meaſure,</hi> but the moſt plentiful Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, being <hi>anointed above his Fellows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe being the ſeveral ſorts and degrees of Revelation, which God hath made of himſelf to the World, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures are a Syſtem or Collection of theſe, the authentick Inſtrument or Record, by which the things revealed any of theſe ways, are tranſmitted to us, and is therefore call'd <hi>the Word of God,</hi> as containing thoſe things which God in ſeveral Ages hath ſpoken to the World; that is, matters of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which are neceſſary to be known by Men, in order to their Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. And this being now the great and ſtanding Revelation of God, which is to continue to the end of the World, I intend to limit my Diſcourſe ſolely to this, as being the only Revelation which we are concern'd to enquire after.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the 3<hi>d</hi> Place to ſhew you what Advantages this ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revelation of the Scriptures hath, above private Revelations made to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, and frequently repeated and renewed in ſeveral Ages; that ſo it may appear both agreeable to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God to ſettle Revelations in this way, as being more commodious; and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:58790:208"/>
likewiſe to his Goodneſs, it being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Priviledge which theſe later Ages of the World enjoy, that they have a more fixt and certain way of being acquainted with the Will of God, than thoſe Ages had, which were govern'd by ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Revelations, as were now and then made to particular Perſons. And the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a more certain way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of things, and more ſecure and free from Impoſture. Suppoſe a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to a particular Perſon, which is of general Concernment, that this may have a general and laſting effect, he muſt impart it to others, as many as he can, and give them the beſt Aſſurance he can of it; and theſe muſt relate it to others; and ſo it muſt paſs from hand to hand, to be delivered from Parents to their Children. Now this way of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Revelation by Oral Report muſt needs be liable to many Uncertainties, both by involuntary Miſtakes, through Weakneſs of Memory or Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and wilful Falſifications and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, out of Malice and Deſign. So that the effect of an unrecorded Revelation can neither be large nor laſting, it can but reach a few Perſons, and continue
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:58790:208"/>
a little while in its full Credibility; and the further it goes, the weaker, like Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles made in Water, which the more they inlarge themſelves, and the longer they continue, the leſs diſcernable they are 'till at length they quite diſappear. Whereas being once recorded by Perſons ſecured from Error, by Supernatural and Divine Aſſiſtance, they are not lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe eaſie Falſifications or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, which traditional Reports and Relations are neceſſarily, through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Malice or Weakneſs, liable to.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a more general and univerſal way of Conveyance; Which is evident from the common Experience of the World, who have pitched upon this way of writing things in Books, as that which doth moſt eaſily convey the knowledge and notice of things to the generality of Men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a more uniform way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; that is, things that are once written and propagated that way, lye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually open to all, and come in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with equal Credit to all; it being not morally poſſible that a common Book, that paſſeth through all hands, and which is of vaſt Importance and Concernment, ſhould be liable to any material Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:58790:209"/>
without a general Conſpiracy and Agreement, which cannot be, but that it muſt be generally known. So that conſidering the commonneſs, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Concernment of this Book of the Scriptures, all Men are in a manner e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, that is, every Man is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and competently aſſur'd of the credit of it; that is, that we are not in any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial thing impoſed upon by falſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies. But in traditional Revelation it is quite otherwiſe; Traditional being a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unequal and ununiform way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance. For ſeeing it may be of general Concernment, and all cannot have it at the firſt hand, that is, immediately from him to whom it was made; but ſome at the ſecond, others at the third, fourth, or fifth hand, or much further off; the Credit of it will be neceſſarily weakned by every Remove. A Report that comes through many Hands, being like the Argument we call <hi>Induction</hi>; and as the Strength and Goodneſs of that depends upon the Truth of every one of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that make it up, ſo that if any of them fail, the whole Argument is naught; ſo the credit of a Report that paſſeth through twenty hands, depends upon the Integrity and Sufficiency of all
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:58790:209"/>
the Relators, and whatever there is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Falſhood and Malice, or of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of Underſtanding, or Frailty of Memory in any of the Relators, ſo much Weakneſs is derived into the Report or Teſtimony; and conſequently the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which we can have of a private Revelation, which is deliver'd traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally through a great many Perſons, muſt needs be very unequal.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a more laſting way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance. Which likewiſe appears by Experience, we having now nothing at all of the Hiſtory of ancient times, but what is conveyed down to us in Writing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is a more human way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, which requires leſs of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and ſupernatural Interpoſition for the Preſervation of it. This Book of the Scriptures may with ordinary human Care be tranſmitted intire, and free from any material Error, to all ſucceeding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But Revelations unwritten, if they have any laſting and conſiderable Effect, they muſt at leaſt in every Age be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and repeated; otherwiſe in a very ſhort ſpace, either through the unfaithfulneſs, or careleſsneſs and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Men, they will either be quite loſt,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:58790:210"/>
or ſo corrupted and depraved, that they will ſignifie nothing.</p>
            <p>From all which it appears, that we have ſo little cauſe to murmur and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at the Providence of God, which in theſe later Ages of the World does not make thoſe more immediate Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries and Manifeſtations of himſelf to us, that he did to former Ages, that we have rather great reaſon to admire the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which hath privileged us with this ſtanding Revelation of his <hi>written Word,</hi> which hath ſo many ways the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of frequent and extraordinary Revelation, and in reſpect of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Mankind, is much more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and effectual to its end. I know there are ſome that have endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World, that Doctrines may much better be preſerved by common Rumor and Report, than by Writing and Record; but I hope there is no Man ſo deſtitute of common Senſe as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them contrary to the Experience of all Men.</p>
            <p>I come now to the 4<hi>th</hi> thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be conſider'd; namely, That there is ſufficient Evidence of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Scriptures. By the Divinity
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:58790:210"/>
of the Scriptures, I mean, that they were revealed by God, and that the things contained in them were not invented by Men, but diſcovered to Men by God; and that the Pen-men of theſe Books did not write their own private Conceptions, but were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt. Now if we can be ſatisfy'd of this, we ought to receive the Scriptures with the ſame reverence, as if an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould declare theſe things unto us, or as if God ſhould immediately reveal them to our Minds; for nothing can come with greater Authority than this, that we believe it to be revealed by God; and provided we be aſſured of this, it matters not which way; the thing hath the ſame Authority.</p>
            <p>Now that we have ſufficient Evidence of the divinity of the Scriptures, will beſt appear, by conſidering what is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give Authority to a Book, ſo that no prudent or reaſonable Man can queſtion, but that the Book was writ by him whoſe Name it bears. For what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence we would accept of, for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of other Books, we muſt not refuſe in this caſe for the Scriptures; if we do, we deal unequally, and it is a ſign that we do not want Evidence for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures, but that we have no mind to believe them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:58790:211"/>Now the utmoſt Authority that any Book is capable of, is, that it hath been tranſmitted down to us by the general and uncontroll'd Teſtimony of all Ages, and that the Authority of it was never queſtioned in that Age wherein it was written, nor invalidated ever ſince.</p>
            <p>And this Evidence we have for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures. As for the Old Teſtament, I ſhall not now labour in the proof of that by Arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to it ſelf, but ſhall take the Divinity of them upon the Authority of the New, which, if it be proved, is ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for it, tho' there were no other.</p>
            <p>Now for the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, I deſire but theſe <hi>two</hi> things to be granted to me at firſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all were written by thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe Names they bear; and for this we have as much Authority, as for any Books in the World, and ſo much as may ſatisfie Men in other caſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be rejected in this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That thoſe who wrote thoſe Books were Men of Integrity, and did not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully falſifie in any thing; and this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be denied, becauſe theſe very Perſons gave the utmoſt Evidence that Men could give of their Integrity. The higheſt atteſtation that any Man
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:58790:211"/>
can give of the Truth of what he relates, is to lay down his Life for the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of it; and this the Apoſtles did.</p>
            <p>Now if this be granted, that they did not falſifie in their Relations concerning the Miracles of Chriſt, and his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the miraculous Gifts which were beſtowed upon the Apoſtles after his Aſcenſion; this is as great an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as the world can give, and as the thing is capable of, that our Saviour was <hi>a Teacher come from God,</hi> and that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were extraordinarily aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt; and if this be granted, what can be deſired more to prove the Divinity of their Writings?</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, that tho' the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were granted to be Men of Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that they did not wilfully falſifie in their Relations, yet they might be miſtaken about thoſe Matters. But that they were not, we have as much Evidence as can be for any thing of this Nature, namely, that the things which are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are plain ſenſible matters of Fact, about which no Man need miſtake, unleſs he will; and they did not write things upon the report of others, who might poſſibly have deſigns to deceive, but upon the ſureſt Evidence in the world, their own Knowledge, and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:58790:212"/>
the Teſtimony of their Senſes; <hi>the things that we have ſeen and heard teſtifie we unto you.</hi> So that if they were miſtaken in theſe things, no Man can be ſure of any thing; and by the ſame reaſon that we disbelieve the Authority of the Scriptures upon this account, we muſt believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. This is in ſhort the whole force of the Argument for the divinity of the Scriptures, which I might have enlarged infinitely upon; but I deſign now only briefly to repreſent to you, that we, who live at the diſtance of ſo many Ages from the time of this Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not deſtitute of ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the Authority of the Scriptures, and ſuch Evidence, as they who reject in other Caſes, are eſteemed unreaſonable,</p>
            <p>I ſhould come now to the</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>th,</hi> and laſt Thing, namely, that it is unreaſonable to expect, that God ſhould do more for our Conviction, than to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us a ſtanding Revelation of his Mind and Will, ſuch as the Books of the Holy Scriptures are. But this I ſhall refer to another Opportunity, in a particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the 31 <hi>verſe,</hi> which contains the main Deſign, the Sum, and Subſtance of this whole Parable.</p>

            <p>THESE Words are the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that excellent Parable of our Saviour concerning the Rich Man and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and they are the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Anſwer which <hi>Abraham</hi> gives to the Rich Man's laſt Requeſt; who being in great <hi>Torment,</hi> and not able to obtain any Eaſe for himſelf, is repreſented as concerned for his Relations, whom he had left behind him upon Earth; leſt
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:58790:213"/>
they alſo by their own Careleſsneſs and Folly ſhould plunge themſelves into the ſame Miſery that he was in,<note place="margin">Vol. V.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he begs of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would <hi>ſend Lazarus to</hi> his <hi>Father's Houſe,</hi> where he had <hi>five brethren, that he might teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy unto them, leſt they alſo ſhould come into that place of Torment.</hi> To which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwers, that there was no neceſſity of ſuch an extraordinary courſe to be uſed toward thoſe who had ſufficient means of Conviction ſo near at hand, if they would but hearken to them, and make uſe of them. <hi>Abraham ſaith unto him, they have Moſes and the Prophets; let them hear them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Rich Man preſſeth his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt further, upon this Reaſon, that they might not perhaps be moved by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets,</hi> nay it was likely they would not be moved by them; for they had always had them, and yet they remained impenitent: But if a ſpecial Meſſenger ſhould be ſent to them from the dead, this certainly could not fail to awaken them, and bring them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>And he ſaid, Nay, Father A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</hi> To which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> makes this peremptory Reply, <hi>If
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:58790:213"/>
they hear not Moſes and the Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ser. 12.</note> 
               <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they be perſuaded, tho one roſe from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Words <hi>Abraham</hi> abſolutely denies that there is any ſuch Probability, much leſs Certainty, that thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a publick credible Revelation of God, ſuch as that of the Holy Scriptures is, ſhould be effectually convinced by a Meſſenger from the dead. And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our brings in <hi>Abraham</hi> delivering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very poſitively in this matter, and therefore we may preſume it to be our Saviour's own Senſe, and may rely upon it for a Truth; which however at firſt ſight it may not be ſo evident, yet I hope in the progreſs of this Diſcourſe to make it ſufficiently clear.</p>
            <p>But before I undertake that, I ſhall promiſe a Caution or two to prevent all Miſtake in this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> That we are not to underſtand theſe Words too ſtrictly and rigorouſly, as if the thing were ſimply and in it ſelf impoſſible, that a Man who is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by hearing or reading <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets,</hi> ſhould be brought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance any other way. For it is very poſſible in the Nature of the thing, yea and likely enough, that a Man who is
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:58790:214"/>
not convinced by calm Evidence and Perſwaſion, may yet be very much wrought upon by a ſtrange and amazing Accident; and if one, whom he had known when he was alive, ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him from the dead, and declare the certainty of a future State, and the condition of things in another world, there is little doubt to be made, but that this would more rouze and awaken him to conſider his Danger, than all the Threatnings of God's Word; and 'tis very poſſible that, by the Concurrence of God's Grace, this might prove an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Means to convince ſuch a Man, and to bring him to Repentance. And yet for all this, it is not probable upon the whole matter, and if all Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be duly conſider'd, that this ſhould generally have a permanent effect upon Men, ſo as throughly to reclaim ſuch Perſons as do obſtinately reſiſt the Light and Counſels of God's Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Caution I would give is this, That we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe Words ſo, as to weaken the force of that Argument from Miracles for the Proof and Confirmation of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Doctrine; as if our Saviour intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſinuate, that Miracles are not
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:58790:214"/>
a proper and ſufficient Argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men. For our Saviour does not here oppoſe <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets</hi> to a miraculous Teſtimony; but he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the publick Evidence and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Evidence of a ſingle and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Miracle; for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets</hi> had their Confirmation from Miracles; and Miracles are the great Evidence and Atteſtation which God hath always gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Divinity of any Perſon or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> cannot be thought to ſpeak any thing to the Prejudice of Miracles, when he ſays, <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they be perſuaded, tho one roſe from the dead.</hi> Nay ſo far is he from that, that this reaſoning of his is rather for the Advantage of Miracles. For <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets</hi> had the Confirmation of many and great, of publick and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Miracles; a credible Relation whereof was conveyed down to after Ages. So that if rational Means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction were the thing deſired, it was not likely that thoſe, who were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets,</hi> which were acknowledged by themſelves to have had the Confirmation of ſo many
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:58790:215"/>
undoubted Miracles, ſhould in reaſon be convinced by a private and ſingle Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations being premiſed by way of Caution, I come now to make out the Truth of what is here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the Text. And for the full clearing of this matter, I ſhall ſpeak to theſe <hi>two</hi> Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is unreaſonable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God ſhould do more for the Conviction of Men, than to afford them a ſtanding Revelation of his Mind and Will; ſuch as that of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is. And if ſo, then</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is very improbable, that thoſe who reject this publick Revelation of God, ſhould be effectually convinced, tho' one ſhould ſpeak to them from the dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is unreaſonable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God ſhould do more for the Conviction of Men, than to afford them a ſtanding Revelation of his Mind and Will; ſuch as that of the Holy Scriptures is. This is ſtrongly impli'd in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s firſt Anſwer, <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them</hi>; as if he had ſaid, having ſuch Means of Conviction ſo near at hand, why ſhould they deſire
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:58790:215"/>
and expect any other? It is in this caſe of the Scriptures, as in that of God's Providence; God does not commonly prove his Providence to Men by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inſtances of his Power, and by changing the Courſe of Nature, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince every Man in the World that he governs it: but by ſtanding Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his Wiſdom, and Power, and Goodneſs; by theſe God does ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſatisfie conſiderate Men of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Care of the World; and tho' he do ſeldom manifeſt himſelf in ſupernatural and extraordinary ways, yet he hath not left himſelf without a Witneſs, by the conſtant courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the returns of Day and Night, in the Revolutions of the Seaſons of the Year, <hi>in that he gives us rain from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and fruitful Seaſons, filling our Hearts with food and gladneſs.</hi> And theſe ſtanding Arguments of his Providence, tho' they be not ſo much taken notice of, becauſe they are ſo common, yet are they daily Miracles, and we can hardly imagine greater, and we ſhould be ſtrangely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at them, but that they are ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequent and familiar.</p>
            <p>The caſe is the ſame as to Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. God hath not thought fit to
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:58790:216"/>
gratified the perverſe Curioſity of Men, by affording to every Man a particular and immediate Revelation of his Mind and Will: but he hath given us a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revelation, which at firſt had the greateſt and moſt miraculous Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he hath ſtill left us ſufficient Means of being aſſured of the Truth of this Revelation, and of the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was at firſt given to it; and we tempt God, by demanding extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Signs, when we may receive ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Satisfaction in an ordinary way. This being admitted, I ſhall proceed in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Place to ſhew, That it is upon the whole Matter, and all Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces conſider'd, very improbable, that thoſe who reject this publick Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, ſhould be effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, tho' one ſhould ſpeak to them from the dead. And this is that which is expreſly aſſerted here in the Text, <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they be perſuaded, tho' one roſe from the dead.</hi> Not but that any Man would be very much ſtartled and amazed, if one ſhould come from the dead to warn him of the Danger of his wicked Life; but yet for all that, it is very unlikely
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:58790:216"/>
that they who obſtinately and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſe to be convinced by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets,</hi> would be effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, (that is, ſo as to be brought to Repentance and Reformation of their Lives) <hi>tho' one ſhould riſe from the dead.</hi> And that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe if ſuch Miracles were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and familiar, it is very probable they would have but very little effect; and unleſs we ſuppoſe them common and ordinary, we have no Reaſon to expect them at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men have as great or greater Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe the Threatnings of God's Word, as the Diſcourſe of one that ſhould ſpeak to them from the dead.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The very ſame reaſon which makes Men to reject the Counſels of God in his Word, would in all probability hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from being convinced by a particular Miracle.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Experience does abundantly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, how ineffectual extraordinary ways are to convince thoſe who are obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted and wedded to their Luſts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. An effectual Perſuaſion (that is, ſuch a Belief as produceth Repentance and a good Life) is the Gift of God, and depends upon the Operation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:58790:217"/>
of God's Grace, which there is no reaſon to expect either in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, or in an extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, after Men have obſtinately reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ordinary Means which God hath appointed to that end.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If ſuch Miracles, as a ſpecial Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger from the dead to warn and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh Men, were frequent and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, it is very probable they would have but very little effect upon Men, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we ſuppoſe them common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, we have no reaſon to expect them at all. For it is unreaſonable at firſt ſight, that the worſt and more obſtinate ſort of Sinners ſhould expect this, as a peculiar Favour and Priviledge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that God ſhould not do as much for others, who have deſerved it more, and would probably make better uſe of it; and if theſe things were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, it is very probable that Men would not be much moved by them. It may be, while the Apprehenſion of ſuch a thing were freſh upon them, they would take up ſome good Reſolutions; as Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners uſually do, while they are under preſent Convictions of Conſcience, and the Hand of God, by ſome great Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Sickneſs, lies heavy upon them:
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:58790:217"/>
but ſtill they would be apt to defer their Repentance, and put it off 'till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Amazement were a little over, and the terrour of their firſt Apprehenſions were abated and worn off by degrees, and after a little while they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their former Courſe. And this is too too probable, from what we ſee Men do in other caſes not very much remote from this. It is a very terrible and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing thing to ſee a Man die, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly take his laſt leave of the World. The very Circumſtances of dying Men are apt to ſtrike us with horror; to hear ſuch a Man how ſenſibly he will ſpeak of the other World, as if he were juſt come from it, rather than going to it; how ſeverely he will condemn himſelf for the Folly and Wickedneſs of his Life; with what Paſſion he will wiſh that he had lived better, and ſerved God more ſincerely; how ſeriouſly he will reſolve upon a better Life, if God would be pleaſed to raiſe him up, and try him but once more; with what Zeal and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs he will commend to his beſt Friends and neareſt Relations, a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and virtuous Courſe of Life, as the only thing that will miniſter Comfort to them when they come to be in his
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:58790:218"/>
Condition. Such Diſcourſes as theſe, are very apt to move and affect Men for the time, and to ſtir up in them very good Reſolutions, whilſt the preſent Fit and Impreſſion laſts: but becauſe theſe ſights are very frequent, they have ſeldome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and permanent effect upon Men. Men conſider that it is a very common Caſe, and Sinners take Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Encouragement from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; every one is affected for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but few are ſo effectually convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as to betake themſelves to a better Courſe.</p>
            <p>And if Apparitions from the dead were as common, as it is for Men to die, we may reaſonably preſume that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of dead and dying, of thoſe that are going, and thoſe who come from the dead, would have much the ſame effect upon the generality of Men.</p>
            <p>But if we ſuppoſe this a ſingular Caſe, (which there is no reaſon to do) in that caſe the Effect would probably be this; a Man that were ſtrongly addicted to his Luſts, and had no Mind to leave them, would be apt when the Fright were over, to be eaſily perſuaded that all this was merely the work of Fancy and Imagination; and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:58790:218"/>
ſuch things did not happen to others, as well as to himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have as great or greater Reaſon to believe the Warnings or Threatnings of God's Word, as the Diſcourſes of one that ſhould come to us from the dead. For the Threatnings of God's Word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch Sins as natural Light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth Men of, have the natural Guilt and Fears of Men on their ſide, the particular Teſtimony of every Man's Conſcience, and the concurrent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Mankind to the Probability of the thing; and to give us full Aſſurance of the Truth and Reality of them, we have a credible Relation of great and unqueſtionable Miracles wrought on purpoſe to give Teſtimony to thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who denounced thoſe Threatnings, that they came from God. So that here is a very publick and authentick Teſtimony given to the Threatnings of God's Word, more ſuitable to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Mankind, and of greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than a private Apparition, or a ſingle Miracle; and if <hi>that</hi> will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men, why ſhould we ſuppoſe that <hi>this</hi> will?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The very ſame Reaſon which makes Men to <hi>reject the Counſels of God</hi>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:58790:219"/>
in his Word, would, in all probability, hinder Men from being convinced by an Apparition from the Dead. It is not generally for want of Evidence, that Men do not yield a full and effectual Aſſent to the Truth of God's Word, I mean, that they do not Believe it ſo as to Obey it: but from the Intereſt of ſome Luſt. The true cauſe is not in Mens Underſtandings, and becauſe there is not Reaſon enough to ſatisfy them, that the Scriptures are the Word of God; but in the obſtinacy of their Wills, which are enſlaved to their Luſts. And the Diſeaſe being there, it is not to be Cured by more Evidence, but by more Conſideration, and by the Grace of God, and better Reſolutions.</p>
            <p>The Man is addicted to ſome Vice or other, and that makes him unwilling to entertain thoſe Truths which would check and controul him in his Courſe. The light of God's Word is offenſive to him, and therefore he would ſhut it out. This account our bleſſed Saviour gives of the Enmity of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt him and his Doctrine, <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>Light is come into the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Men love darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than light, becauſe their deeds are evil: for every one that doeth evil, hateth the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:58790:219"/>
light, neither cometh he to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> Upon the ſame account it is, that Men reſiſt the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures; not becauſe they have ſufficient Reaſon to doubt of their Divine Authority; but becauſe they are unwilling to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by them, and to conform their Lives to the Laws and Precepts of that Holy Book: For the Wills of Men have a great Influence upon their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, to make aſſent eaſy or difficult; and as Men are apt to aſſent to what they have a mind to, ſo they are ſlow to believe any thing which croſſeth their Humours and Inclinations; ſo that tho' greater Evidence were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, it is likely it would not prevail with them, becauſe the matter does not ſtick there. Their Wills are diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, <hi>Men hate to be reform'd,</hi> and this makes them <hi>caſt the Laws of God behind their Backs</hi>; and if God himſelf ſhould ſpeak to them from Heaven, as he did to the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; yet for all that, they might continue <hi>a ſtiff-necked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious People.</hi> Tho' the Evidence were ſuch as their Underſtandings could not reſiſt; yet their Wills might ſtill hold out, and the preſent condition of their
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:58790:220"/>
Minds might have no laſting influence upon their Hearts and Lives; ſuch a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conviction might affect them for the preſent, but the Senſe of it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps wear off by degrees, and then they would return to their former hardneſs. Men, by a long and obſtinate continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſin, may bring themſelves to the Temper and Diſpoſition of Devils; who though <hi>they believe and tremble</hi> at the thoughts of God and his Threatnings, yet they are wicked ſtill; for ſo long as Men retain a ſtrong affection for their Luſts, they will break through all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and what Evidence ſoever be offer'd to them, they will find ſome way or other to avoid it, and to delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The plain truth of the caſe is this, (if Men will honeſtly ſpeak their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, they cannot deny it) they do not call for more Evidence, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want it, or are willing to be convinced by it; but that they may ſeem to have ſome Excuſe for themſelves, for not being convinced by that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which is afforded to them.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> Experience does abundantly teſtify, how ineffectual extraordinary ways are to convince and reclaim men of depraved Minds, and ſuch as are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:58790:220"/>
addicted to their Luſts. We find many remarkable Experiments of this in the Hiſtory of the Bible. What Wonders were wrought in the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi>! yet they were harden'd under all theſe Plagues. <hi>Balaam,</hi> who <hi>greedily followed the wages of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> was not to be ſtopt by the admonition of an Angel. The <hi>Jews,</hi> after ſo many Miracles which their Eyes had ſeen, continued to be a <hi>ſtiffneck'd and gain ſaying People</hi>; ſo that it is hard to ſay which was more prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, the Wonders which God wrought for them, or their Rebellions againſt him; and when <hi>in the fulneſs of time,</hi> the Son of God came and did among them <hi>the works which never man did,</hi> ſuch, as one would have thought, might have brought the worſt People in the world to Repentance, thoſe of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> yet they repented not. Yea the very things, which the Rich Man here in my Text, requeſted of <hi>Abraham</hi> for his Brethren, was done among them; <hi>Lazarus</hi> did <hi>riſe from the dead,</hi> and <hi>teſtified unto them,</hi> and <hi>they were not perſwaded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And which is yet more, our Saviour
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:58790:221"/>
himſelf, according to his own Prediction while he was alive, <hi>roſe again from the dead the third day,</hi> and was viſibly taken up into Heaven; and yet how few among them did <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>give glory to God</hi>! So that we ſee the very thing here ſpoken of in the Text, made good in a famous Inſtance; they who <hi>believed not Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> which teſtified of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> were <hi>not perſwaded</hi> when he <hi>roſe from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And does not our own Experience tell us, how little effect the extraordinary Providences of God have had upon thoſe who were not reclaimed by his Word. It is not long ſince God ſhewed himſelf among us, by <hi>terrible things in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and viſited us with three of his ſoreſt Judgments, War, and Peſtilence, and Fire; and yet how does all manner of Wickedneſs and Impiety ſtill reign and rage among us! It is a very ſad Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to ſee how little thoſe who have outlived theſe Plagues, have been reformed by them; <hi>we have not return'd to the Lord, nor ſought him for all this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may appeal to the Experience of particular Perſons. How frequently do we ſee Men, after great Afflictions,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:58790:221"/>
and tedious Sufferings, and dangerous Sickneſſes, return to their former Evil Courſes! and tho' they have been upon the brink of Eternity, and <hi>the terrors of Death have compaſs'd them about, and the pains of Hell have</hi> almoſt <hi>taken hold of them,</hi> tho' they have had as lively and ſenſible Convictions of another world, as if they had ſpoken with thoſe that had come from thence, or even been there themſelves; yet they have taken no warning, but upon their deliverance and recovery, have been as mad, as furious Sinners as they were before; ſo that it ought to be no ſuch wonder to us, which the Text tells us, that <hi>if men hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead.</hi> Eſpecially, if we conſider in the</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>th</hi> and laſt place, That an effectual perſwaſion (that is, ſuch a Belief as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Repentance and a good Life) is the gift of God, and depends upon the operation and concurrence of his Grace, which is not to be expected in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, where Men have obſtinately rejected the ordinary means appointed by God for that end. To be effectually perſwaded to change
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:58790:222"/>
our Lives, and become new Men, is a Work not to be done without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God's Grace; and there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to expect that God will afford his Grace to thoſe, who reject and deſpiſe the Counſels of his word. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation contain'd in the Holy Scriptures, and the Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God's word, are the ordinary Means which God hath appointed for the Converſion of Men, and to bring them to Repentance; and if we ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe theſe means, we may confidently expect the concurrence of God's Grace, to make them effectual, but if we neglect and reſiſt theſe means, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that God ſhould attempt our Recovery by ſome extraordinary ways; though he ſhould gratifie our preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and unreaſonable Curioſity, ſo far as to ſend <hi>one from the dead to teſtifie unto us</hi>; yet we have no reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the aſſiſtance of his Grace, to make ſuch a Conviction effectual to our Repentance, when we have ſo long deſpiſed his word, and reſiſted his Spirit, which are <hi>the power of God unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without his Grace and Aſſiſtance, the moſt probable means will prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:58790:222"/>
to alter and change our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Natures; <hi>by Grace we are ſaved,</hi> and <hi>that not of our ſelves; it is the Gift of God.</hi> This Grace is revealed to us in the Goſpel; and the Aſſiſtances of it are conveyed to us by the Goſpel; and it is great preſumption to promiſe to our ſelves the aſſiſtance of God's Grace in any other way than he hath been pleaſed to promiſe it to us.</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſhewn you, as briefly and plainly as I could, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely it is, that thoſe who obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject a clear and publick Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, ſhould be effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and brought to Repentance by any Apparitions from the dead.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only make two or three Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from this Diſcourſe which I have made, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> Since the Scriptures are the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and ſtanding Revelation of God's Will to Men, and the ordinary Means of Salvation, we may hence conclude, That People ought to have them in ſuch a Language as they can underſtand. This our Saviour plainly ſuppoſeth in the Diſcourſe which he repreſents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Rich Man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be ſent from
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:58790:223"/>
the dead <hi>to his Brethren, to teſtifie unto them</hi>; to which Requeſt <hi>Abraham</hi> would not have given this Anſwer and Advice, <hi>they have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them,</hi> had he ſuppoſed that the Scriptures then were, or for the future ought to be lockt up from the People in an unknown Tongue; for the Rich Man might very well have replied, <hi>nay Father Abraham,</hi> but they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have <hi>Moſes and the Prophets</hi> in ſuch a Language as they can underſtand; and therefore there is more need why <hi>one ſhould be ſent from the Dead</hi> to <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor would <hi>Abraham</hi> have ſaid again, <hi>if they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded.</hi> For how ſhould Men hear what they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, ſo as to be perſuaded by it.</p>
            <p>It is evident then, that our Saviour, according to the Reaſoning of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, takes it for granted, that the Holy Scriptures are the ſtanding and ordinary means of bringing Men to Faith and Repentance, and that the People are to have the free uſe of them. But ſince our Saviour's time, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath found a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inconvenience in this, and therefore
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:58790:223"/>
hath taken the Scriptures out of the Hands of the People. They will not now let them <hi>have Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> the Goſpel of our bleſſed Saviour, and the Writings of his Apoſtles, becauſe they are really afraid they ſhould <hi>hear them,</hi> and by hearing of them, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and <hi>perſwaded</hi> of the Errors and Corruptions of their Church; but inſtead of the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, they have put into their Hands a Legend of famous Apparitions of <hi>Men from the Dead, teſtifying unto them</hi> concerning Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory and Tranſubſtantiation, and the Worſhip of the Bleſſed Virgin and the Saints, and the great benefit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment which Souls in Purgatory have by the Indulgences of the Pope, and the Prayers of the living put up to Saints and Angels on their behalf; ſo that in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> quite contrary to our Saviour's method, Men are <hi>perſuaded</hi> of their Religion, of their New Articles of Faith, and Ways of Worſhip, not by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> not by the Doctrine of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures (for <hi>they</hi> every where te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt them) but by abſurd Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and ill-contriv'd Fictions of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:58790:224"/>
               <hi>from the Dead.</hi> I will diſmiſs this matter with this one Obſervation, that however intereſted and confident Men may ſet a bold face upon any thing, yet it cannot to conſiderate Men but ſeem a very hard caſe, that there ſhould be no ſalvation to be had out of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and yet the ordinary, and (in our Saviour's Judgment) the moſt effectual Means of Salvation are not to be had in it.</p>
            <p>But I paſs from this, to that which does more immediately concern our Practice.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Let us hear and obey that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Revelation of God's Will, which in ſo much Mercy to Mankind, he hath been pleaſed to afford to us. This is an ineſtimable Priviledge and Advantage which the world in many Ages was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of, having no other Guide to conduct them to eternal Happineſs but the Light of Nature, and ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Revelations, which now and then God was pleaſed to make of his Will to Men: But now God hath ſet up a great and ſtanding Light in the world, the Doctrine of the holy Scriptures; and by the Goſpel of his bleſſed Son, hath <hi>given the knowledge of Salvation to all Men, for
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:58790:224"/>
the remiſſion of their Sins, through the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies of God, whereby the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us, to give light to them that ſat in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, and to guide our feet into the way of peace,</hi> to convince us of the Error of our ways, and to direct us in our Duty. <hi>We, upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> do enjoy all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of divine Revelation which the world ever had, and as great as the world ever ſhall have. <hi>God in theſe laſt days hath ſpoken unto us by his Son,</hi> and if we will not hear him, God will imploy no other extraordinary Prophet and Meſſenger to us. <hi>If the wrath of God</hi> ſo clearly <hi>revealed from Heaven by the Goſpel of our bleſſed Saviour, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of Men</hi>; if the Terror of the great day, and the fear of eternal Torment; if the dreadful Sufferings of the Son of God for our Sins, and the merciful offers of Pardon and Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation in his Blood, and the glorious hopes of eternal Life and Happineſs will not prevail with us to leave our Sins, and to amend our Lives, we have no reaſon to expect that God ſhould uſe any farther means to reclaim us; that he ſhould ever
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:58790:225"/>
make any more Attempts for our Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> Thoſe who are not brought to Repentance, and effectually <hi>perſwaded</hi> by this clear and publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation which God hath made of his Will to Men in the Holy Scriptures, have reaſon to look upon their Caſe as deſperate.</p>
            <p>Methinks it ſhould not be a deſirable thing to any of us to be convinced by an Apparition, the thing is ſo dreadful and full of Terrour; beſides that it argues Men to be ſtrangely hardned in a bad Courſe, and obſtinately bent upon their evil ways, when nothing will affright them from their Sins, but what will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt put them out of their Wits; when nothing will keep them from running into Hell, but a fearful and ghaſtly Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger from thence. What a terrible ſight would it be to any of us, to meet one of our Companions, whom we had lately known in this World, freſh come out of thoſe Flames, with the ſmell of Fire and Brimſtone upon him! What Imagination can paint to it ſelf the dread and horror of ſuch a Spectacle! The Rich Man here in the Parable, when he was in Hell, is repreſented as ſenſible
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:58790:225"/>
of the inconvenience of this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did not deſire to be ſent himſelf to his Brethren, but deſired that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might go and teſtifie unto them; he was apprehenſive how frightful a ſight he himſelf muſt needs have been to them, and therefore he deſires that they might have a gentler warning by one, who from out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom had ſeen the Miſeries of the damned, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the State of the bleſſed.</p>
            <p>But let not us tempt God by any ſuch unreaſonable Demand, who ſpeaks to us every day by the plain Declarations of his Word, and hath of late Years call'd ſo loudly upon us by the Voice of his Providence to repent and turn to him; by ſo many Miracles of Mercy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, as God hardly ever wrought for any Prince and People, and by ſuch terrible Vollies of Judgments, and full <hi>Viols of wrath,</hi> as have ſeldom been poured out upon any Nation. God ſpeaks to you by his Miniſters, Men like your ſelves (God knows, poor frail and ſinful Men) but we are ſure, that when we call you to Repentance, we deliver to you the Will and Pleaſure, the Counſels and Commands of the great God, which (whatever Account may
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:58790:226"/>
be made of us) do certainly challenge your moſt awful attention and regard. And we are ſenſible that we are call'd to a very difficult and unpleaſant work, to contend with the Luſts and Vices of Men, to ſtrive againſt the ſtrong and impetuous Streams of a wicked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Generation; and nothing in the world could move us to this unwelcome and grievous Importunity, but a great and juſt ſenſe of our own Duty, and your Danger. And if we will not take theſe Warnings, why ſhould we expect that God ſhould vouchſafe to ſend an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Meſſenger to us from the other world, to certifie us how all things are there, and that not ſo much to help the weakneſs of our Faith, as to humour the perverſeneſs of our Infidelity? And why ſhould we imagine that this Courſe would prove more effectual? <hi>Let us not deceive our ſelves,</hi> the ſame Luſts which now detain men ſo ſtrongly in Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and Unbelief, would in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility hurry them on to Hell, tho' an Angel from Heaven ſhould meet them in their way, to give a ſtop to them. This indeed might ſtartle us; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is like to ſave us, if the word of God and his Grace do not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:58790:226"/>But are we in earneſt, and would we <hi>be perſwaded if one ſhould riſe from the dead?</hi> God hath condeſcended thus far to us, there is <hi>one riſen from the dead to teſtifie unto us,</hi> Jeſus the Son of God, who <hi>died for our ſins, and roſe again for our juſtification,</hi> and is aſcended into Heaven, and ſet down at the right hand of God, to aſſure us of a bleſſed Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and a glorious Immortality. And if this will not ſatisfie us, God will gratifie our Curioſity no farther. If we <hi>will not believe him, whom God hath ſent,</hi> and to convince us that he hath ſent him, hath <hi>raiſed him up from the dead, we ſhall die in our ſins,</hi> and periſh in our Impenitency. God hath in great mercy to Mankind done that which is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to convince thoſe who are of a teachable Temper and Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But in great wiſdom and juſtice he hath not thought fit to provide any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the wilful Obſtinacy and intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable Perverſeneſs of Men.</p>
            <p>Now God who hath the Hearts of all Men in his hands, perſwade us all, <hi>to break off our ſins by repentance, and to give glory to God,</hi> before Death and Darkneſs come, and the day of our final
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:58790:227"/>
Viſitation overtake us, when we may perhaps be ſurprized by a ſudden ſtroke, or ſeized upon by a violent Diſeaſe, and may have no ſenſe and apprehenſion of our approaching Danger; or if we have, <hi>may find no place for Repentance, tho' we ſeek it with Tears</hi>; which God grant may never happen to be the Caſe of any of us, for his Mercy's ſake in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>To whom with the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>THESE Words are in the Parable of the Rich Man's Steward, who being called upon to give up his Accounts, in order to his being diſcharged from his Office, caſt about with himſelf, what courſe he had beſt to take, to provide for his ſubſiſtence, when he ſhould be turned out of his Employment. At laſt he reſolves upon this; That he will go to his Lord's Debtors, and take a favourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them; and inſtead of <hi>a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred meaſures of Oil, write down fifty,</hi>
               <pb n="448" facs="tcp:58790:228"/>
and inſtead of <hi>a hundred meaſures of wheat write down fourſcore</hi>;<note place="margin">Vol. V.</note> that by this means he might oblige them to be kind to him in his Neceſſity. The Lord hearing of this, commends the unjuſt Steward, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had done wiſely</hi>; That is, he took notice of his Diſhoneſty; but praiſed his Shrewdneſs and Sagacity, as having done prudently for himſelf, though he did not deal juſtly with him; and this is uſual among Men. When we ſee a Man ingeniouſly bad, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Wit, and to ſay it is great pity, he doth not uſe it better, and apply it to good purpoſes. Upon the whole, our Saviour make this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>that the Children of this world, are in their generation wiſer than the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light</hi>; as if he had ſaid, thus did this worldly Wiſe-man, thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident was he for his future ſecurity and ſubſiſtence. He no ſooner underſtands that he is to be turned out of his Office, but he conſiders what Proviſion to make for himſelf againſt that time. And is it not pity, that good Men do not apply this Wiſdom to better and greater purpoſes? For is not every Man ſuch a Steward, entruſted by God with the Bleſſings of this
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:58790:228"/>
Life;<note place="margin">Ser. 13.</note> and many opportunities of doing good? For all which, ſince he muſt ſhortly give an Account, he ought in all Reaſon ſo to uſe them, as thereby to provide for the Happineſs of another Life, againſt this temporal Life have an end.</p>
            <p>And this is all the Parallel intended in this Parable, as we may ſee by our Saviour's Application of it. For Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are not to be ſtretched to an exact Parallel in all the Parts and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them; but only to be applied to the particular point and purpoſe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A Parable, and the Moral accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of it, being (as one well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) not like two Plains, which touch one another in every part; but like a Globe upon a Plain, which only touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in one Point. Thus our Saviour ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates the Wiſdom of this Steward from his Injuſtice, and propoſeth <hi>that</hi> to our imitation; <hi>The Children of this World are in their Generation wiſer than the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Words are a Compariſon; in which we have</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> The Perſons compared, <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world,</hi> and the <hi>Children of Light.</hi> It is a very uſual Phraſe among
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:58790:229"/>
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when they would expreſs any thing to partake of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Quality, to call it the Son or Child of ſuch a thing. Thus good men are call'd <hi>the Children of God,</hi> and bad men <hi>the Children of the Devil</hi>; thoſe who mind earthly things, and make the things of this world their greateſt aim and Deſign, are called <hi>the Children of this world</hi>; and thoſe who are better enlightned with the Knowledge of their own immortality, and the Belief of a future ſtate after this life, are call'd <hi>the Children of light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Here is the thing, wherein they are compared, and that is, as to their Wiſdom and Prudence.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> The Object of this Prudence, which is not the ſame in both; as if the Senſe were, that <hi>the Children of this world are wiſer than the Children of Light,</hi> as to the things of this world; but here are two ſeveral Objects intended, about which the prudence of theſe two ſorts of Perſons is reſpectively exerciſed; the concernments of this world and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And our Saviour's meaning is, that <hi>the Children of this world are wiſer in their generation</hi>; that is, in <hi>their way,</hi> viz. as to the Intereſts and Concernments
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:58790:229"/>
of this world, <hi>than the Children of Light</hi> are in <hi>theirs, viz.</hi> as to the Intereſts and Concernments of the other world.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> Here is a deciſion of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and which of them it is that excels in point of Prudence, in <hi>their way</hi>; and our Saviour gives it to the <hi>Children of this world; they are wiſer in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the Children of Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Propoſition is not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the utmoſt ſtrictneſs and rigor; as if it were univerſally true, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exception; as if no Man had ever been ſo Wiſe and Provident for his Soul, and the Concernments of another world, as worldly Men are for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and Concernments of this Life. For there are ſome that are Fools at large, and imprudent in their whole conduct and management, both as to the Affairs of this world, and the other; who are in too ſtrict a ſenſe, <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world.</hi> They mind nothing but this world, and yet are groſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, even in their proſecution of their temporal Intereſts. They neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and forego all other worldly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, for the ſake of a little ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſure; and then they loſe and deſtroy that too, by an over-hot and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:58790:230"/>
eager purſuit of it, and turn it at laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gall and Wormwood. And there are others, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> for inſtance) who, I doubt not, have been as prudent, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and induſtrious for the promoting of Religion, and the Salvation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, as any man can be about the Affairs of this preſent Life; and I hope there are ſome ſuch in every Age, but God knows they are very few, and their Wiſdom and Induſtry is ſeldom ſo equal, and conſtant, and uniform, as that of <hi>the Men of this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that we are to underſtand this Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour's with the ſame Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance as we generally do all Moral and Proverbial Speeches, that they are true for the moſt part, and the Inſtances and Exceptions to the contrary are very rare. It is ſeldom ſeen, that good men are ſo wiſe for the Concernments of their Souls, and of Religion, as many worldly men are for their worldly Intereſts.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to this Propoſition, I ſhall do theſe <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Confirm and illuſtrate the Truth of it, by conſidering the ſeveral Parts and Properties of Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Give ſome probable account of this, by conſidering what Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:58790:230"/>
               <hi>the Children of this world</hi> have above <hi>the Children of Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall draw ſome Inferences from the whole, by way of Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to confirm and illuſtrate the Truth of this, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſeveral parts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Wiſdom. Now this is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to mind and regard our chief end, and by all means to promote it; and this regard to our chief End doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it ſelf chiefly in theſe particulars; in our being firmly fixt and reſolved upon it; in chuſing the fitteſt Means for the compaſſing and accompliſhing of it; in a diligent Uſe of thoſe Means; in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Conſtancy and Perſeverance in the proſecution of it; and in making all things to ſubmit and to ſtoop to it. Theſe are the principal parts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Wiſdom; and I ſhall ſhew, that in all theſe <hi>the Children of this World</hi> do uſually excel <hi>the Children of Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> They are uſually more firmly fixt and reſolved upon their End. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſet up for their End, Riches, or Honours, or Pleaſures, they are fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and ſteady in the Proſecution of it. If they ſet up for Riches or Honour, they
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:58790:231"/>
neglect and deſpiſe Pleaſure, if it croſs either of thoſe Ends. And this fixt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the End is the great ſpring of Action, and that which inſpires Men with Vigour and Diligence in the uſe of Means; and the more reſolved Men are upon the End, the more active and induſtrious they will be in the uſe of Means; for the End governs the Means, and gives Law and Meaſure to our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Induſtry in the uſe of them, and ſweetens and allays the Trouble and Difficulty of them.</p>
            <p>So that where the End is once firmly fixt and reſolved upon, there will not be wanting fervour of Proſecution; but if we be wavering and unſteady as to our End, this will weaken our Hands, and quench the heat of our endeavours, and abate the eagerneſs of our Purſuit, and according to the degree of it, will derive a debility and inconſtancy into all our Motions. <hi>The double-minded Man</hi> (as St. <hi>James</hi> ſays) <hi>being unſtable in all his ways.</hi> Now <hi>the Children of this world</hi> are commonly more fixt and reſolved upon their End, than <hi>the Children of light.</hi> 'Tis rare to ſee the whole Life and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a good Man, ſo conſtantly and uniformly conſpiring to the furtherance
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:58790:231"/>
of his great End, ſo directly tending to the Salvation of his Soul, and the encreaſe of his Glory and Happineſs in another World; as the Actions of a worldly Man, and the whole Courſe of his Life do, to the advancing of his worldly Intereſts. The covetous or ambitious Man ſeldom do any thing, to the beſt of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that is impertinent to their End, much leſs contrary to it; through every thing that they do, one may plainly ſee the End they aim at, and that they are always true to it: Whereas the beſt Men do many things, which are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſs and contrary to their End, and a great many more, which have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to it; and when they mind it, it is, rather by fits and ſtarts, than in any even courſe and tenor of Actions.</p>
            <p>And of this we have a famous inſtance in that worldly and ſecular Church, which now for ſeveral hundreds of Years hath more ſteadily purſued the End of ſecular Greatneſs and Dominion, than any other Church hath done the Ends of true Religion, the Glory of God, and the Salvation of the Souls of Men, ſo that there is hardly any Doctrine or Practice peculiar to that Church, and differing from our common Chriſtianity,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:58790:232"/>
but it hath a direct and viſible tendency to the promoting of ſome worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or other. For inſtance, Why do they deny the People the Holy Scriptures and the Service of God, in a language which they can underſtand? but that by keeping them in Ignorance, they may have them in more perfect Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Subjection to them? Why do they forbid their Prieſts to marry? but that they may have no Intereſt diſtinct from that of their Church, and leave all to it when they die? To what end is Auricular Confeſſion? but to keep Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in awe, by the knowledge of their Secrets? Why muſt the Laity only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament in one kind, but to draw a greater Reverence to the Prieſt, whoſe Priviledge it ſhall be to receive in both? And why is the Intention of the Prieſt neceſſary to the efficacy of the Sacraments? but to perſwade the People, that notwithſtanding the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Intention of God toward Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, they cannot be ſaved without the good will of the Prieſt? The Doctrines of Purgatory and Indulgences are a plain device to make their Markets of the Sins and Souls of Men. I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in a hundred things more in that
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:58790:232"/>
Church, which are of the ſame tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. This St. <hi>John</hi> foretold ſhould be the Character of the Spirit of Antichriſt, that it ſhould be a worldly Spirit, and the Doctrines of it ſhould ſerve a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intereſt and Deſign, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.5. <hi>They are of the World, and they ſpeak from the World, and the World hears them.</hi> What Church is there in the world, ſo true throughout to the Intereſt of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as this worldly Church hath been to its own Secular Power and greatneſs?</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly. The Children of this world</hi> are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer in the choice of Means in order to their End; and this is a great part of Wiſdom. For ſome Means will bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an End, with leſs pains, and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and expence of Time than others. And the Men of the world are very ingenious in diſcerning the fitneſs and force of Means to their ſeveral Ends. To what a certainty have Men reduced all the ways and arts of Gain, and growing rich, and of riſing to Honour and Preferment? What long Trains will Men lay to bring about their deſired End? What ſubtil methods have men deviſed, to inſinuate themſelves into Court; and when they are there, to plant themſelves in the Eye of their Prince, and in the Sunſhine of his Favour?
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:58790:233"/>
and then they have as many ways of worming others out, as of ſcrewing themſelves in.</p>
            <p>But in the Concernments of our Souls, and the Affairs of another world, how dull and injudicious are we? and how awkardly and untowardly do we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Means to Ends, as if Men were <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe to do evil, but to do good had no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> as the Prophet complains? By what incongruous and irregular Means do many (who would ſeem to be, and ſometimes perhaps are very zealous in Religion) endeavour (as they think) to promote God's Glory, by pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Frauds and counterfeit Miracles, and telling officious Lies for God? What a compaſs do many Men fetch to go to Heaven, by innumerable devices of Will-Worſhip, by voluntary Severities, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſing to God, nor profitable to Men? By tedious Pilgrimages, and ſenſeleſs Ceremonies, and innumerable little external Obſervances, of no Virtue and Efficacy in Religion? and by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring through a wilderneſs of Opinions, and the buſhes and brakes of unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Queſtions, and Controverſies? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the way to Heaven lies plain and ſtraight before us, conſiſting in Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:58790:233"/>
of Belief, and in Holineſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of Life. Not but that there are great differences in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> between the Secular Prieſts and the Regular; between the Janſeniſts and the Jeſuits: but they ſtill unite in a common Intereſt, and are ſubject to <hi>Antichriſt</hi> their common Head. They do not ſeparate from one another, and excommunicate one another, and declare againſt one another, that they are not of the true Church. <hi>Satan never caſts out Satan</hi>; and though he love Diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, yet he always takes care, that <hi>his own Kingdom be not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt it ſelf,</hi> ſo as to endanger the Ruin of it. And whenever they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hopeful deſign for the extirpation of Proteſtants they can lay aſide their Enmities, and be reconciled in ſuch a deſign. Then the Pope and the Kings of the Earth <hi>take counſel together,</hi> and like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> when Chriſt was to be crucified, can be made Friends at a days warning. Whereas the Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f the true Church are pernicious to it; and as we ſee at this Day among our ſelves, our ſenſeleſs Differences and wild Heats on both ſides, do contribute to the ſetting up of Popery, and the
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:58790:234"/>
ruin of the Reformed Religion; and yet no Perſwaſion, no Experience can make us wiſer.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly. The Children of this world</hi> are commonly more diligent in the Uſe of Means for the obtaining of their End; they will ſweat and toil, and take any Pains, <hi>riſe up early, and lie down late, and eat the bread of Carefulneſs</hi>; their thoughts are continually running upon their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and they catch at every Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of promoting it; they will pinch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and haraſs it; and rob themſelves of their Reſt, and all the Comfort of their Lives to raiſe their Fortune and Eſtate. What Drudges were <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> in the way of Fame and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition? How did they tire themſelves and others with long and tedious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? To what Inconveniences and Dangers did they expoſe themſelves and Thouſands more? What Havock and Deſtruction did they make in the world, that they might gain to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the empty Title of Conquerors of it? When the Men of the worl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in any Deſign, how intent are they upon it, and with what vigour do they proſecute it? They do not counterfeit a Diligence, and ſeem to be more ſerious
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:58790:234"/>
and induſtrious than in truth they are; they are rather hypocrites the other way, and would conceal their Covetouſneſs and Ambition, and not ſeem to aſpire after Riches, and Honours, ſo much as indeed they do.</p>
            <p>But in the purſuit of better things, how cold and remiſs are we? With what a careleſs indifference do moſt men mind their Souls? How negligent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and many times Hypocritical are they in the Service of God, and the Exerciſe of Religion? With what a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Courage, and with what faint Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do they reſiſt Sin, and encounter the Temptations of it; and how often, and how eaſily are they foil'd and baffl'd by them.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> The Men of the world are more invincibly conſtant and pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the purſuit of Earthly things; they are not to be bribed or taken off by favour or fair Words; not to be daunted by Difficulties, or daſht out of Countenance by the Frowns and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of men. Offer an Ambitious Man any thing ſhort of his End and Aim, to take him off from the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it; he ſcorns the motion, and thinks you go about to fool him out
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:58790:235"/>
of his Intereſt. Bait a Covetous man with Temptations of Pleaſure, to get his Money from him; how generouſly will this mean-ſpirited man trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Pleaſure, when it would tempt him from his Deſign of being rich?</p>
            <p>Difficulties do not daunt them, but whet their Courage, and quicken their Endeavours, and ſet a keener edge upon their Spirits. Give an Ambitious man almoſt a demonſtration of the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his attempt; <hi>contrà audentior ibit,</hi> he will go on ſo much the more boldly and reſolutely. In the ways of Religion men are apt to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and put out of Countenance, by Contempt and Reproach: but a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man is not to be jeer'd and flurted out of his Money and Eſtate; he can be content to be Rich, and give leave to thoſe that are not ſo, to laugh at him.</p>
            <q>Populus mihi ſibilat, at mihi plaudo.</q>
            <p>The Rich Worldling can hug him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Bags, when the world hiſſeth at him; he can bear <hi>to be hated, and perſecuted, and have all manner of evil ſpoke againſt him</hi> for <hi>Money ſake.</hi> And in the purſuit of theſe Deſigns, men will, with great Reſolution, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:58790:235"/>
Enmity and Oppoſition, and endure great Sufferings and Perſecution. How many have been Martyrs to their Luſts, and have Sacrificed their Eaſe and Health, and even their Lives in the proſecution of their Ambitious, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, and Voluptuous Deſigns?</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, how eaſily are men check'd and diverted from a good Courſe, by the Temptations and Advantages of this world? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are cold in their Zeal for Religion, by the Favour and Friendſhip of this world? And as their Goods and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate have grown greater, their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath grown leſs. How apt are they to be terrified at the apprehenſion of Danger and Sufferings; and by their fearful Imaginations, to make them greater than they are; and with the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be diſhearten'd from all further Attempts of entring <hi>into the land of promiſe,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>full of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and the Sons of Anak?</hi> How ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily was <hi>Peter</hi> frighted into the deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of his Maſter? And when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was apprehended, how did his Diſciples forſake him, and flye from him? And tho they were conſtant afterwards to the Death, yet it was a great while
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:58790:236"/>
before they were perfectly armed and ſteel'd againſt the fear of Suffering.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> The men of the world will make all things ſtoop and ſubmit to that, which is their great End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; their End rules them, and governs them, and gives Law to all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they will make an Advantage of every thing, and if it will not ſerve their End one way or other, they will have nothing to do with it. If an ambitious man ſeek Wealth, it is but in order to his Deſign, to purchaſe Friends, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Intereſt, and make his riſing the eaſier; he will lay his whole Eſtate at the ſtake, rather than miſs of his End. The covetous man will quit his Pleaſure, when it lies croſs to his intereſt; if he have any expenſive Luſt, and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Vice, he will turn it off, or exchange it for ſome more frugal and profitable Sin.</p>
            <p>But in the affairs of Religion, and the concernments of our Souls, how frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do men act without a due Regard and conſideration of their great End? and inſtead of making other things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, they often bow and bend it to their inferior Intereſts. They make Heaven ſtoop to Earth, and Religion to
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:58790:236"/>
ſerve a worldly Deſign; and the glory of God to give way to gain; and the great Concernments of their Souls, and their eternal Salvation, to their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Profit and Advantage. The Men of the world are generally true to their great End, and pay it that Reſpect which is due to it, and will ſuffer nothing to take place of it in their Eſteem and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and if men were as wiſe for their Souls and for another world, they would bring all things to their great End, and make all the Concernments of this Temporal Life to yield and give way to the great Concernments of their Eternal Happineſs. I proceed in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Place to give ſome account of this, whence it comes to paſs, that <hi>the Children of this world are wiſer in their generation than the Children of Light.</hi> And this I ſhall do, by conſidering what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages <hi>the Children of this world</hi> have, as to the Affairs of this world, above what good men have, as to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of another world. I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in four or five of the chief.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> The Things of this world are preſent and ſenſible, and becauſe of their nearneſs to us, are apt to ſtrike power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon our Senſes, and to affect us
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:58790:237"/>
mightily, to excite our Deſires after them, and to work ſtrongly upon our Hopes and Fears: but the things of another world being remote from us, are leſſen'd by their diſtance, and conſequently are not apt to work ſo powerfully upon our Minds; they are inviſible to us, and only diſcerned by Faith, which is a more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and leſs certain Perception of things, than we have of thoſe Objects which are preſented to our bodily Eyes. <hi>The things which God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> the Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the next world, are <hi>things which Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light</hi> do not ſee God, as <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world</hi> ſee <hi>Mammon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> The ſenſual Delights and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this world, are better ſuited and more agreeable to the corrupt and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Nature of Men, than Spiritual and heavenly things are to thoſe that are regenerate. In this lapſed and degenerate ſtate of Mankind, Appetite and Senſe are apt to prevail above Reaſon; and therefore thoſe things which are moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to Senſe we ſavour and mind, and love to buſy our ſelves about them, becauſe they are moſt ſuitable to the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life, which is the governing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of corrupt Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:58790:237"/>And the Reaſon of this is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Principle in worldly and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual men which purſues earthly things, is in thoſe who are unregenerate, entire and undivided, and conſequently the Affections and Inclinations of the whole man do all tend one way, and run out towards thoſe things in a full and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Stream: Whereas good Men are but regenerate in part, and tho' they have a principle of ſpiritual Life in them, yet their Affections are divided, and there is a great ſtruggling and conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fleſh and Spirit, and it is a great while before the ſpiritual Principle doth clearly prevail, and get a perfect Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over our ſenſual Appetites and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Mens Affections to the world are entire and unbroken, and therefore they purſue theſe things with all their might: But the beſt men are but good in part; and that heavenly Principle which is in them, is very much hindred in its Operations by a contrary Principle, our earthly and ſenſual Inclinations, which are hardly ever perfectly ſubdu'd and brought under in this world.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> The worldly man's Faith, and Hope, and Fear of preſent and ſenſible things, is commonly ſtronger than a
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:58790:238"/>
good man's Faith, and Hope, and Fear of things future and eternal. Now Faith, and Hope, and Fear, are the great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which govern and bear ſway in the actions and lives of men. If a man be once firmly perſuaded of the reality of a thing, and that it is good for him, and poſſeſt with good hopes of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and great fears and apprehenſions of the Danger of miſſing it, this man may almoſt be put upon any thing. The Merchant trafficks, and the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man plows and ſows in Faith and Hope, becauſe he is convinced that Bread is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the ſupport of Life, and hopes that God will ſo bleſs his Labours, that he ſhall reap the fruit of them; and plainly ſees, that if he do not take this Pains, he muſt ſtarve. But how few are there that believe, and hope, and fear concerning the things of another world, as <hi>the Children of this world</hi> do concerning the things of this world? If any man asks me, how I know this? I appeal to Experience; it is plain and viſible in the Lives and Actions and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of men. Good men are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſo effectually and throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the Principles of Religion, and the truth of the Sayings contained
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:58790:238"/>
in the holy Scriptures, as the men of the world are of their own Sayings and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs. Men do not believe that <hi>Honeſty is the beſt Policy,</hi> or as <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th it, that <hi>he that walketh uprightly, walketh ſurely</hi>; as the Men of the world believe their own Maxims, that <hi>a man may be too honeſt to live</hi>; that <hi>plain dealing is a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, but he that wears it ſhall die a Beggar.</hi> Few Men's hopes of heaven are ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and vigorous, and have ſo ſenſible an effect upon their Lives, as the worldly Man's hopes of Gain and Advantage. Men are not ſo afraid to ſwear, as they are to ſpeak Treaſon; they are not ſo firmly perſwaded of the danger of ſin to their ſouls and bodies in another world, as of the danger to which ſome Crimes againſt the Laws of Men do expoſe their temporal lives and ſafety; therefore they will many times venture to offend God, rather than incur the Penalty of human Laws.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> The Men of the world have but one deſign, and are wholly intent upon it, and this is a great Advantage. He that hath but one thing to mind, may eaſily be skill'd and excel in it. When a man makes one thing his whole buſineſs,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:58790:239"/>
no wonder if he be very knowing and wiſe in that. Now the men of the World mind worldly things, and have no care and concernment for any thing elſe. It is a ſaying I think of <hi>Thomas Aquinas, Cave ab illo qui unicum legit librum: He is a dangerous man that reads but one Book</hi>; he that gives his Mind but to one thing, muſt needs be too hard for any Man at that. Application to one thing, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in matters of Practice, gains a Man perfect experience in it, and experience furniſheth him with Obſervations about it, and theſe make him wiſe and prudent in that thing.</p>
            <p>But good Men, tho' they have a great affection for Heaven and heavenly things, yet the buſineſs and neceſſities of this Life, do very much divert and take them off from the Care of better things, they are divided between the Concernments of this Life and the other; and tho' there be but <hi>one thing neceſſary</hi> in compariſon, yet the Conveniences of this Life are to be regarded; and tho' our Souls be our main care, yet ſome Conſideration muſt be had of our Bodies, that they may be ſit for the ſervice of our Souls; ſome Proviſion muſt be made for their preſent ſupport, ſo long as we continue
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:58790:239"/>
in theſe earthly Tabernacles; and this will neceſſarily engage us in the world, ſo that we cannot always and wholly apply our ſelves to heavenly things, and mind them as the Men of the world do the Things of this world.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> The Men of the world have a greater Compaſs and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the purſuit of their worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, than good men have in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of <hi>their</hi> Intereſt. The <hi>Children of Light</hi> are limited and confined to the uſe of lawful Means for the compaſſing of their ends; but the Men of the world are not ſo ſtrait-laced, <hi>quocunque modo rem,</hi> they are reſolved upon the Point, and will ſtick at no Means to compaſs their End. They do not ſtand upon the nice diſtinctions of good and evil, of right and wrong, invented by ſpeculative and ſcrupulous Men, to puzle buſineſs, and to hinder and diſappoint great Deſigns. If <hi>Ahab</hi> have a mind to <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and <hi>Naboth</hi> will not let him be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and have it for a valuable Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he will try to get it a cheaper way. <hi>Naboth</hi> ſhall by Falſe Witneſs be made a Traytor, and his Vineyard by this means ſhall be forfeited to him. And thus the unjuſt Steward in the Parable provided
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:58790:240"/>
for himſelf, he wronged his Lord, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a retreat to himſelf in the time of his Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> thing only remains, to make ſome Inferences from what hath been ſaid, by way of Application. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> Notwithſtanding the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which hath been given of the Wiſdom of this world, yet upon the whole matter it is not much to be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and admired. It is indeed great in its way and kind: but it is applied to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and low purpoſes, imployed about the Concernments of a ſhort time and a few days, about the worſt and meaneſt part of our ſelves, and accompanied with the neglect of greater and better things, ſuch as concern our ſoul, and our whole duration, even our happineſs to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And therefore that which the world admires and cries up for Wiſdom, is in the eſteem of God, who judgeth of things according to truth, but Vanity and Folly. <hi>The wiſdom of the world</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) is Fooliſhneſs with God.</hi> The Rich Man in the Parable, who increaſed his Goods, and enlarged his Barns, and laid up for many years, did applaud himſelf, and was no doubt applauded by others for a very Wiſe Man: but becauſe <hi>he laid
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:58790:240"/>
up Treaſure for himſelf, and was not rich towards God,</hi> that is, did not employ his Eſtate to good and charitable Purpoſes, therefore God, who calls no body out of his right Name, calls this Man <hi>Fool; Thou Fool, this night ſhall thy Soul be taken from thee, and then whoſe ſhall all theſe things be?</hi> And our Saviour here in the Text, while he commends the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this World,</hi> he adds that which is a conſiderable blemiſh and abatement to it, <hi>The Children of this world are wiſer, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for their Age,</hi> for the concernments of this preſent Life; but this is but a ſhort and purblind Wiſdom, which ſees but a little way, and conſiders only things preſent and near at hand: whereas true Wiſdom hath a larger and farther Proſpect, and regards the future as well as the preſent, and takes care to provide for it. Nay our Saviour gives the Wiſdom of this world its utmoſt due, when he ſays, <hi>The Children of this World are wiſe for their generation</hi>; for this is the very beſt that can be ſaid of it, it ſeldom looks ſo far, and holds out ſo long. Many Men have ſurvived their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and have lived to ſee the Folly and ill Fate of their covetous and ambitious Deſigns. So the Prophet tells us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11. <hi>As the Partridge ſitteth on eggs,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:58790:241"/>
and hatcheth them not; ſo he that getteth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his days, and at his end ſhall be a Fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is Wiſdom, to regard our main Intereſt; but if we be wrong in our end, (as all worldly Men are) the faſter and farther we go, the more fatal is our error and miſtake. <hi>The Children of this world</hi> are out in their end, and miſtaken in the main; they are wiſe for this world, which is inconſiderable to eternity; wiſe for a little while, and Fools for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> From what hath been ſaid we may infer, that if we loſe our Souls, and come ſhort of eternal happineſs, it is through our own fault and groſs neglect; for we ſee that men are wiſe enough for this world; and the ſame prudence, and care, and diligence applied to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of our Souls, would infallibly make us happy. Nay our Saviour here in the Text tells us, that uſually leſs wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and induſtry, than the Men of this world uſe about the things of this world, is exerciſed by <hi>the Children of light,</hi> who yet at laſt, through the mercy of God, do attain eternal Life.</p>
            <p>So that it is very plain, that if Men would but take that care for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, which they generally do
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:58790:241"/>
for their frail and dying Bodies, and be as heartily concern'd for the unſeen world, and for eternity, as they are for things viſible and temporal, they would with much more certainty gain Heaven, than any Man can obtain worldly Riches and Honours. And can we in conſcience deſire more, than to be happy for ever, upon as eaſy and upon more certain Terms, than any Man can be rich or great in this world? For we may miſs of theſe things after all our travel and pains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; or if we get them, we may loſe them again: But if we <hi>ſeek the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and his righteouſneſs,</hi> if we be ſincerely good, we are ſure to have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, even that <hi>eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, hath promiſed</hi>; if we <hi>lay up for our ſelves Treaſures in Heaven,</hi> they will be ſafe and ſecure there, where <hi>no Moth can corrupt, nor Thieves break through and ſteal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we would ſeriouſly think of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, and were throughly poſſeſt with a firm belief of the eternity of that happineſs or miſery, which remains for Men after this Life, we ſhould pray to God, and hear his Word, and perform all the Duties of Religion, with the ſame care and concernment, with the ſame fervour and intention of Mind, as
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:58790:242"/>
Men proſecute their worldly buſineſs. Were we fully perſwaded of the unſeen Glories and Torments of the other world, we ſhould be much more affected with them, than with all the Temptations and Terrors of ſenſe; becauſe in Reaſon they are much more conſiderable. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the Pillory will fright Men from Perjury; and will not everlaſting ſhame and Confuſion? The fear of Death will deter many men from robbing and ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who would perhaps venture upon theſe Crimes, if there were no danger in them; and will not the Horrors of the <hi>ſecond Death,</hi> of <hi>the worm that dies not, and the fire that is not quenched,</hi> have as great an awe and influence upon us? If they have not, it is a ſign, that we do not equally believe the danger of Human Laws, and the Damnation of Hell.</p>
            <p>Surely Men have not the ſame belief of Heaven, and Affection for it, that they have for this world. If they had, their Care and Diligence about theſe things would be more equal. For we are not ſo weak as we make our ſelves; we are not yet ſo degenerate, but if we would ſet our ſelves ſeriouſly to it, and earneſtly beg the Aſſiſtance of God's Grace, we might come to know our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:58790:242"/>
and our Wills might be engaged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the directions of our Underſtandings, and our Affections to obey the Command of our Wills, and our Actions to follow the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of our Affections. Much of this is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Power; and what is wanting, the Grace of God is ready to ſupply. We can go to Church, and we can hear the Word of God, and we can conſider what we hear, we can pray to God, and ſay <hi>we believe, Lord help our unbelief,</hi> and enable us to do what thou requireſt of us; and we can forbear a great many Sins, which we raſhly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully run into; a great preſent Danger will fright us from Sin, a terrible Storm will drive us to our Devotion, and teach us to pray; a ſharp fit of the Gout, will take a Man off from drinking; the Eye of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Magiſtrate will reſtrain Men from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, which they ſay they cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear. So that we do but counterfeit, and make our ſelves more Cripples than we are, that we may be pitied; for if Fear will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us, it is a ſign that we can forbear; if <hi>the rod of Affliction will fetch it out</hi> of us, and make us do that, which at other times we ſay we are unable to do, this is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that it is in us, and that the thing is in our Power.</p>
            <p>It is true, we can do nothing that is good without the Aſſiſtance of God's Grace: but that Aſſiſtance which we may have for asking, is in effect in our own Power. So that if the matter were ſearched to the bottom, it is not
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:58790:243"/>
want of Power that hinders us from doing our Duty; but Sloth and Negligence; for God hath <hi>given us exceeding great and precious Promiſes, whereby we may be made Partakers of a divine Nature</hi>; and by Virtue whereof, if we be not wanting to our ſelves, we may <hi>cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, and perfect Holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> What a Shame and Reproach is this to <hi>the Children of Light!</hi> Our Saviour ſpeaks this by way of upbraiding, as we may judge by the terms of compariſon which he uſeth, that <hi>the Children of this World</hi> ſhould be <hi>wiſer than the Children of Light,</hi> that is, than <hi>Wiſdom's own Children</hi>; and that they ſhould be <hi>wiſer in their Generation,</hi> that is, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of a ſhort and inconſiderable time, than the others are for all Eternity.</p>
            <p>How ſhould it make our Blood to riſe in our Faces, and fill us with Confuſion, that the Men of this World ſhould be more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and skilful in the contrivance and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their little Affairs, more reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and vigorous in the proſecution of them; than we are about the everlaſting Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Souls! That a worldly Church ſhould uſe wiſer and more effectual Means to promote and uphold Ignorance, and Error, and Superſtition; than we do to build up the true Church of Chriſt in Knowledge and Faith and Charity! That the Men of the World ſhould toil and take more Pains for <hi>the deceitful Riches</hi>; than we do for <hi>the true</hi>; and be contented to hazard more for <hi>a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:58790:243"/>
Crown,</hi> than we for <hi>an incorruptible</hi>! That they ſhould love Pleaſure more than we do God, and mind their Bodies and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Eſtates more, than we do our Souls and our eternal Happineſs!</p>
            <p>Do but obſerve the Men of the World, what a Pace they go, what large and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſteps they take in the purſuit of earthly things, they do not ſeek Riches <hi>as if they ſought them not,</hi> and love the World <hi>as if they loved it not,</hi> and enjoy the preſent delights of this World, <hi>as if they poſſeſt them not</hi>; tho' <hi>the faſhion of this World paſſeth away</hi>: but we ſeek Heaven, <hi>as if we ſought it not,</hi> and love God <hi>as if we loved him not,</hi> and mind Eternity and the World to come, <hi>as if we minded them not</hi>; and yet <hi>the faſhion of</hi> that <hi>World doth</hi> not <hi>paſs away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to all this it may be ſaid, you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told us, that <hi>the Children of this world</hi> have ſo many advantages above <hi>the Children of Light,</hi> that it is no wonder if they excel and out-ſtrip them; and it is very true, that in many reſpects they have the Advantage of them. But if <hi>the Children of Light</hi> would look about them, and take all things into conſideration, they might ſee ſomething ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable to balance the Advantages on the other ſide. It is true, the things of this World are preſent and ſenſible: but ſo long as we have ſufficient Aſſurance of the reality of a future State, and of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments of it, the Greatneſs and Eternity of theſe is ſuch an amazing
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:58790:244"/>
Conſideration that no diſtance can render them inconſiderable to a prudent and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man. And tho' the Men of the World have an entire Principle, which is not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between God and the World; whereas in good Men there is a great conflict of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Principles, the Fleſh and Spirit: yet this diſadvantage is likewiſe ballanced by that powerful Aſſiſtance of God's Grace, which is promiſed to all good Men, who heartily beg it of him, and are ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make uſe of it. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> tho' the Men of the World have many Ways to compaſs their Ends; yet <hi>the Children of Light</hi> have one great and infallible one. All the Means which the Men of the World uſe to accompliſh their Deſigns, may fail and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; for <hi>the Race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battel to the ſtrong, nor yet Bread to the wiſe, nor Riches to Man of underſtanding, nor Favour to Men of skill; but time and chance happen to all:</hi> but he that ſincerely ſerves God, and uſeth the Means for the attaining of everlaſting Salvation, is ſure to attain it; if we <hi>ſeek the righteouſneſs of God</hi> as we ought, we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>be admitted into his Kingdom.</hi> And this ſurely is an unſpeakable Advantage which <hi>the Children of Light</hi> have above <hi>the Children of this World,</hi> that if we faithfully uſe the Means, we cannot fail of the End; <hi>if we have our fruit unto holineſs, our end ſhall be everlaſting Life</hi>; Which God of his infinite Goodneſs grant to us all, for his Mercy's ſake.</p>
