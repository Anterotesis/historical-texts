         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>GIve your Servant, who
hath ever honour'd
you, leave to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of a Book at preſent in the
Preſs, intituled (as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<hi>Animadverſions</hi> upon a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
lately printed under the
name of <hi>Religio Medici;</hi> hereof, I
am advertiſed, you have deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be the Author. Worthy
Sir, permit your Servant to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
there is contain'd therein
nothing that can deſerve the
<pb facs="tcp:100491:3"/>
Reaſon of your Contradictions,
much leſs the Candor of your
<hi>Animadverſions:</hi> and to certifie
the truth thereof, That Book
(whereof I do acknowledge my
ſelf the Author) was penn'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years paſt, and (what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eſcape your apprehenſion)
with no intention for the Preſs,
or the leaſt deſire to oblige the
Faith of any man to its aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But what hath more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
emboldened my Pen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you at preſent, is, That the
ſame Piece, contrived in my
private ſtudy and as an Exerciſe
unto my ſelf, rather than an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation
for any other, having
paſt from my hand under a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and imperfect Copy, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
tranſcription it ſtill run

<pb facs="tcp:100491:3"/>
omiſſion of others, &amp; tranſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of many, without my aſſent
or privacy, the liberty of theſe
times committed it unto the
Preſs; whence it iſſued ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed,
the Author without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
could not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it. Having thus miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
within a few weeks I ſhall,
God willing, deliver unto the
Preſs the true and intended Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
(whereof in the mean time
your worthy Self may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a view;) otherwiſe when
ever that Copy ſhall be extant,
it will moſt clearly appear how
far the Text hath been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and all Obſervations,
Gloſſes, or Exercitations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will in a great part impugn
the Printer or Tranſcriber, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Author. If after
that, you ſhall eſteem it worth
<pb facs="tcp:100491:4"/>
your vacant hours to diſcourſe
thereon, you ſhall but take that
liberty which I aſſume my ſelf,
that is, freely to abound in your
ſenſe as I have done in my own.
However you ſhall determine,
you ſhall ſufficiently honour
me in the Vouchſafe of your
Refute, and I oblige the whole

               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SPeedily upon the Receipt of
your Letter of the third Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
I ſent to find out the
Printer that Mr. <hi>Crook</hi> (who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
me yours) told me was
printing ſomething under my
name, concerning your Treatiſe of
<hi>Religio Medici,</hi> and to forbid him
any further proceeding therein;
but my Servant could not meet with
him; whereupon I have left with
Mr. <hi>Crook</hi> a Note to that purpoſe,
entreating him to deliver it to the
Printer. I verily believe there is
ſome miſtake in the information gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you, and that what is printing
muſt be from ſome other Pen than
mine; for ſuch reflections as I made
upon your learn'd and ingenious
diſcourſe, are ſo far from meriting
the Preſs, as they can tempt no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="tcp:100491:5"/>
to a ſerious reading of them;
they were Notes haſtily ſet down,
as I ſuddenly ran over your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Piece, which is of ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſubject, and ſo ſtrongly penned,
as requireth much time, and ſharp
attention but to comprehend it;
whereas what I writ was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
but of one ſitting; and
there was not twenty four hours
between my receiving my Lord of
<hi>Dorſet</hi>'s Letter that occaſioned
what I ſaid, and the finiſhing my
Anſwer to him; and yet part of
that time was taken up in procuring
your Book, which he deſired me to
read and give him an account of,
for till then I was ſo unhappy as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to have heard of that worthy
diſcourſe. If that Letter ever come
to your view you will ſee the high
value I ſet upon your great parts:
and if it ſhould be thought I have
<pb facs="tcp:100491:5"/>
been ſomething too bold in differing
from your ſenſe, I hope I ſhall eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obtain pardon, when it ſhall be
conſidered, That his Lordſhip aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
it me as an Exercitation to
oppoſe in it, for entertainment, ſuch
paſſages as I might judge capable
thereof; wherein what liberty I
took, is to be attributed to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a private Letter, and to my
not knowing (nor my Lord's) the
perſon whom it concerned.</p>
            <p>But Sir, now that I am ſo happy
as to have that knowledge, I dare
aſſure you, that nothing ſhall ever
iſſue from me but ſavouring of all
honour, eſteem, and reverence both to
your felf, and that worthy produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of yours. If I had the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to give my ſelf reputation by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
the Liſts in publique with ſo
eminent and learned a man as you
are, yet I know right well, I am no
<pb facs="tcp:100491:6"/>
ways able to do it; it would be a
very unequal progreſs: I pretend
not to learning; thoſe ſlender noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I have, are but disjoynted pieces
I have by chance gleaned up here and
there. To encounter ſuch a ſinewy
Oppoſite, or make Animadverſions
upon ſo ſmart a Piece as yours is,
requireth ſuch a ſolid ſtock and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe
in School-learning. My ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
beſprinkling will ſerve
onely for a private Letter, or a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
diſcourſe with Lady-auditors.
With longing I expect the coming
abroad of the true Copy of that Book,
whoſe falſe and ſtoln one hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
given me ſo much delight.
And ſo aſſuring you I ſhall deem it
a great good fortune to deſerve your

of Life, who ſhould deſire
to live when all the world
were at an end; and he
muſt needs be very impatient, who
would repine at death in the ſociety
of all things that ſuffer under it.
Had not almoſt every man ſuffered by
the Preſs or were not the tyranny there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
become univerſal, I had not wanted
reaſon for complaint: but in times
wherein I have lived to behold the
higheſt perverſion of that excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
the name of his Majeſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed,
the Honour of Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,
the Writings of both depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
anticipatively, counterfeitly imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
complaints may ſeem ridiculous in
private perſons; and men of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
may be as incapable of affronts, as
hopeleſs of their reparations. And truely
<pb facs="tcp:100491:7"/>
had not the duty I owe unto the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of friends, and the allegiance I
muſt ever acknowledge unto truth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with me; the inactivity of my
diſpoſition might have made theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
continual, and time that brings
other things to light, ſhould have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
me in the remedy of its oblivion.
But becauſe things evidently falſe are
not onely printed, but many things of
truth moſt falſly ſet forth, in this latter
I could not but think my ſelf engaged.
For though we have no power to redreſs
the former, yet in the other, reparation
being within our ſelves, I have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
repreſented unto the world a full
and intended Copy of that Piece, which
was moſt imperfectly and ſurreptitiouſly
publiſhed before.</p>
                  <p>This I confeſs, about ſeven years paſt,
with ſome others of affinity thereto, for
my private exerciſe and ſatisfaction,
I had at leiſurable hours compoſed;
which being communicated unto one,
it became common unto many, and was
by Tranſcription ſucceſſively corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
untill it arrived in a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued
Copy at the Preſs. He that
<pb facs="tcp:100491:7"/>
ſhall peruſe that Work, and ſhall
take notice of ſundry particulars and
perſonal expreſſions therein, will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcern the intention was not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:
and being a private Exerciſe
directed to my ſelf, what is delivered
therein, was rather a memorial unto
me, than an Example or Rule unto any
other: and therefore if there be any
ſingularity therein correſpondent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the private conceptions of any
man, it doth not advantage them:
or if diſſentaneous thereunto, it no
way overthrows them. It was penned
in ſuch a place, and with ſuch diſadvantage,
that (I proteſt) from the firſt
ſetting of pen unto paper, I had not the
aſſiſtance of any good Book, whereby
to promote my invention, or relieve my
memory; and therefore there might be
many real lapſes therein, which others
might take notice of, and more that I
ſuſpected my ſelf. It was ſet down
many years past, and was the ſenſe of
my conception at that time, not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
Law unto my advancing
judgement at all times; and therefore
there might be many things therein
<pb facs="tcp:100491:8"/>

and as it were framed to my

her Articles, and endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
her Conſtitutions; what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is, beyond, as points indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
I obſerve according to the

humour and faſhion of my Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
neither believing this, becauſe

that, becauſe <hi>Calvin</hi> hath diſavouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> nor approve
all in the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> In brief,
where the Scripture is ſilent, the
Church is my Text; where that
ſpeaks, 'tis but my Comment:
where there is a joynt ſilence of
both, I borrow not the rules of my
Religion from <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> but
the dictates of my own reaſon. It
is an urjuſt ſcandal of our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and a groſs errour in our ſelves,
to compute the Narivity of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100491:12"/>
from <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who

no more than what his own
Predeceſſors deſired and aſſayed in

in our days. It is as uncharitable
a point in us to fall upon thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
ſcurrilities and opprobrious
ſcoffs of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to
whom as temporal Prince, we owe
the duty of good language: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs

excommunicated, Heretick is the

can no ear witneſs, I ever returned

the method of Charity to ſuffer
without reaction: Thoſe uſual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
and invectives, of the Pulpit
may perchance produce a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
on the vulgar, whoſe ears are
opener to Rhetorick than Logick;
yet do they in no wiſe confirm the
faith of wiſer Believers, who know

any man upon the difference of an

for not agreeing with me in
that, from which within a few days
I ſhould diſſent my ſelf. I have no
Genius to diſputes in Religion, and
have often thought it wiſdom to
decline them, eſpecially upon a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
or when the cauſe of
truth might ſuffer in the weakneſs
of my patronage: Where we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be informed, 'tis good to
conteſt with men above our ſelves;
but to confirm and eſtabliſh our
opinions, 'tis beſt to argue with
judgments below our own, that
the frequent ſpoils and Victories
over their reaſons, may ſettle in
our ſelves an eſteem and confirmed
Opinion of our own. Every man
is not a proper Champion for Truth,
nor fit to take up the Gauntlet in
the cauſe of Verity: Many from the
ignorance of theſe Maximes, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100491:13"/>
an inconſiderate Zeal unto Truth,
have too raſhly charged the Troops
of Error, and remain as Trophies
unto the enemies of Truth: A man
may be in as juſt poſſeſſion of Truth
as of a City, and yet be forced to
ſurrender; 'tis therefore far better
to enjoy her with peace, than to
hazzard her on a battle: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there riſe any doubts in my
way, I do forget them, or at leaſt
defer them, till my better ſetled
judgement, and more manly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
be able to reſolve them, for I
perceive every mans own reaſon is
his beſt <hi>Oedipus,</hi> and will upon a
reaſonable truce, find a way to looſe
thoſe bonds wherewith the ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of error have enchained our
more flexible and tender judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
In Philoſophy, where
Truth ſeems double fac'd, there is
no man more Paradoxical than my
ſelf; but in Divinity I love to keep
the Road; and though not in an,
implicite, yet an humble faith, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the great wheel of the Church,
by which I move, not reſerving
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100491:14"/>
any proper Poles or motion from
the Epicycle of my own brain; by
this means I have no gap for Hereſie,
Schiſmes, or Errors, of which at
preſent I hope I ſhall not injure
Truth to ſay I have no taint or tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture:
I muſt confeſs my greener
ſtudies have been polluted with two
or three, not any begotten in the
latter Centuries, but old and obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete,
ſuch as could never have been
revived, but by ſuch extravagant
and irregular heads as mine; for
indeed Hereſies periſh not with their
Authors, but like the River <hi>Arethu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi>
though they loſe their currents
in one place, they riſe up again in
another: One general Council is
not able to extirpate one ſingle He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie;
it may be cancell'd for the
preſent, but revolution of time,
and the like aſpects from Heaven,
will reſtore it, when it will flouriſh
till it be condemned again. For as
though there were <hi>Metempſuchoſis,</hi>
and the ſoul of one man paſſed into
another; Opinions do find after
certain Revolutions, men and minds
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100491:14"/>
like thoſe that firſt begat them. To
ſee our ſelves again, we need not
look for<note n="b" place="margin">A revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, when all things ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto theirformer eſtate, and he be teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again in his School as when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered this Opinion.</note> 
                     <hi>Plato</hi>'s year: every man
is not only himſelf; there hath been
many <hi>Diogenes,</hi> and as many <hi>Timons,</hi>
though but few of that name; men
are liv'd over again, the world is now
as it was in Ages paſt; there was
none then, but there hath been ſome
one ſince that Parallels him, and as
it were his revived ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now the firſt of mine was that of
the <hi>Arabians,</hi> That the Souls of men
periſhed with their Bodies, but
ſhould yet be raiſed again at the laſt
day: not that I did abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a mortality of the Soul; but
if that were, which Faith, not Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
hath yet throughly diſproved,
and that both entred the grave to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
yet I held the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
thereof that we all do for the
body, that it rile again. Surely it
is but the merits of our unworthy
Natures, if we ſleep in darkneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the laſt Alarm. A ſerious reflex
upon my own unworthineſs did
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100491:15"/>
make me backward from challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
this prerogative of my Soul;
ſo that I might enjoy my Saviour at
the laſt, I could with patience be
nothing almoſt unto Eternity. The
ſecond was that of <hi>Origen,</hi> That
God would not perſiſt in his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
for ever, but after a definite
time of his wrath, he would releaſe
the damned Souls from torture:
which error I fell into upon a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
contemplation of the great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
of God, his Mercy; and did
a little cheriſh it in my ſelf, becauſe
I found therein no malice, and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
weight to ſway me from the
other extream of deſpair, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
Melancholy and Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Natures are too eaſily diſpoſed.
A third there is which I did never
poſitively maintain or practiſe, but
have often wiſhed it had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
to Truth, and not offenſive
to my Religion, and that is the
Prayer for the dead; whereunto
I was inclin'd from ſome charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inducements, whereby I could
ſcarce contain my Prayers for a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100491:15"/>
friend at the ringing of a Bell, or
behold his Corps without an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for his Corps: 'Twas a good way
methought to be remembred by
poſterity, and far more noble than
an Hiſtory. Theſe opinions I never
maintained with pertinacy, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to enveagle any mans
belief unto mine, nor ſo much as
ever revealed or diſputed them
with my deareſt friends; by which
means I neither propagated them in
others, nor confirmed them in my
ſelf; but ſuffering them to flame
upon their own ſubſtance, without
addition of new fuel, they went out
inſenſibly of themſelves. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theſe Opinions, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by lawful Councels, were
not Hereſies in me, but bare Errors,
and ſingle Lapſes of my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without a joynt depravity of
my will: Thoſe have not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved

be the Author of an Opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100491:16"/>
the Villany of the firſt Schiſm of

then had my faith been thruſt upon
me; nor ſhould I enjoy that greater
bleſſing pronounced to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

neceſſary belief, to credit what our
eye and ſenſe hath examined: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he was dead and buried, and
roſe again; and deſire to ſee him in
his glory, rather than to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
him in his Cenotaphe, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.
Nor is this much to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
as we have reaſon, we owe
this faith unto Hiſtory: they only
had the advantage of a bold and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Faith, who lived before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who upon obſcure propheſies
and myſtical Types could raiſe a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,

Since I was of underſtanding to

our reaſon how unable it

effects of nature, it becomes more
humble and ſubmiſſive unto the

my haggard and unreclaimed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

I believe there was already a tree
whoſe fruit our unhappy Parents
taſted, though in the ſame Chapter
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100491:18"/>
when God forbids it, 'tis positively
ſaid, the plants of the fields were not
yet grown; for God had not caus'd
it to rain upon the earth. I believe
that the Serpent (if we ſhall literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtand it) from his proper
form and figure made his motion
on his belly before the curſe. I find
the tryal of the Pucellage and virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Women, which God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
the <hi>Jews,</hi> is very fallible.
Experience and Hiſtory informs
me, that not onely many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Women, bur likewiſe whole
Nations have eſcaped the curſe of
Childbirth, which God ſeems to
pronounce upon the whole Sex;
yet do I believe that all this is
true, which indeed my Reaſon
would perſwade me to be falſe;
and this I think is no vulgar part of
Faith, to believe a thing not only
above, but contrary to Reaſon, and
againſt the Arguments of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

their Seeds and Principles in the

where the power of the Sun is; in
theſe is the Wiſdom of his hand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered:
Out of this rank <hi>Solomon</hi>
choſe the object of admiration; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
what reaſon may not go to

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100491:24"/>
them to do what reaſon cannot
teach us? ruder heads ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at thoſe prodigious pieces of
Nature, Whales, Elephants, Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midaries
and Camels; theſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
are the Coloſſus and Majeſtick
pieces of her hand: but in theſe
narrow Engines there is more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Mathematicks; and the civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of theſe little Citizens, more
neatly ſets forth the wiſdom of their
Maker. Who admires not <hi>Regio
Montanus</hi> his Fly beyond his Eagle,
or wonders not more at the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of two Souls in thoſe little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
than but one in the Trunk of
a Cedar? I could never content my
contemplation with thoſe general
pieces of wonder, the Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
of the Sea, the increaſe of <hi>Nile,</hi>
the converſion of the Needle to the
North; and have ſtudied to match
and parallel thoſe in the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
and neglected pieces of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which without further travel
I can do in the Coſmography of
my ſelf; we carry with us the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
we ſeek without us: There is

we are that bold and adventurous
piece of nature, which he that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
wiſely learns in a <hi>compendium,</hi>
what others labour at in a divided
piece and endleſs volume.</p>
                  <p>Thus there are two Books from
whence I collect my Divinity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that written one of God, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his ſervant Nature, that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
and publick Manuſcript, that
lies expans'd unto the Eyes of all,
thoſe that never ſaw him in the
one, have diſcoveerd him in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
this was the Scripture and
Theology of the Heathens; the
natural motion of the Sun made
them more admire him, than its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
ſtation did the Children
of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the ordinary effects of
nature wrought more admiration
in them, than in the other all his
Miracles; ſurely the Heathens
knew better how to joyn and read
theſe myſtical Letters, than we
Chiriſtians, who caſt a more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Eye on theſe common Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks,
and diſdain to ſuck Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100491:25"/>
from the flowers of Nature.
Nor do I ſo forget God as to adore
the name of Nature; which I define
not with the Schools, to be the
principle of motion and reſt, but
that ſtreight and regular line, that
ſettled and conſtant courſe the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God hath ordained the
actions of his creatures, according
to their ſeveral kinds. To make
a revolution every day, is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Sun, becauſe of that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
courſe which God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
it, from which it cannot
ſwerve, by a faculty from that voice
which firſt did give it motion. Now
this courſe of Nature God ſeldome
alters or perverts, but like an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Artiſt hath ſo contrived his
work, that with the ſelf ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
without a new creation,
he may effect his obſcureſt deſigns.
Thus he ſweetneth the Water with
a Word, preſerveth the Creatures
in the Ark, which the blaſt of his
mouth might have as eaſily created;
for God is like a skilful Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
who when more eaſily, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100491:25"/>
with one ſtroak of his Compaſs he
I might deſcribe or divide a right
line, had yet rather do this in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
or longer way; according to
the conſtituted and fore-laid princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of his Art: yet this rule of
his he doth ſometimes pervert, to
acquaint the World with his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
leſt the arrogancy of our
reaſon ſhould queſtion his power,
and conclude he could not: and
thus I call the effects of Nature the
works of God, whoſe hand and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
ſhe only is; and therefore
to aſcribe his actions unto her, is to
devolve the honour of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
agent, upon the inſtrument;
which if with reaſon we may do,
then let our hammers riſe up and
boaſt they have built our houſes,
and our pens receive the honour of
our writing. I hold there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
beauty in the works of God,
and therefore no deformity in any

I cannot tell by what Logick
I we call a <hi>Toad,</hi> a <hi>Bear,</hi> or an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi>
ugly, they being created in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100491:26"/>
thoſe outward ſhapes and figures
which beſt expreſs thoſe actions of
their inward forms. And having
paſt that general Viſitation of God,
who ſaw that all that he had made
was good, that is, conformable to
his Will, which abhors deformity,
and is the rule of order and beauty;
there is no deformity but in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroſity,
wherein notwithſtanding
there is a kind of Beauty. Nature
ſo ingeniouſly contriving the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
parts, as they become ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more remarkable than the
principal Fabrick. To ſpeak yet
more narrowly, there was never
any thing ugly or miſ-ſhapen, but
the Chaos; wherein notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to ſpeak ſtrictly, there was no
deformity, becauſe no form, nor
was it yet impregnant by the voice
of God; Now nature is not at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with Art, nor art with Nature;
they being both ſervants of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
Art is the perfection of
Nature: were the World now as it
was the ſixth day, there were yet,
a Chaos: Nature hath made one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100491:26"/>
World, and Art another. In brief,
all things are artificial; for Nature
is the Art of God.</p>
                  <p>This is the ordinary and open
way of his providence, which Art
and Induſtry have in a good part
diſcovered, whoſe effects we may
foretel without an Oracle: to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew
theſe, is not Propheſie, but
Pognoſtication. There is another
way full of Meanders and Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths,
whereof the Devil and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
have no exact Ephimerides,
and that is a more particular and
obſcure method of his providence,
directing the operations of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals
and ſingle Eſſences: this we
call Fortune, that ſerpentine and
crooked line, whereby he draws
thoſe actions his wiſdom intends in
a more unknown and ſecret way:
This cryptick and involved method
of his providence have I ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
nor can I relate the Hiſtory
of my life, the occurrences of my
days, the eſcapes of dangers, and
hits of chance, with a <hi>Bezo las Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi>
to Fortune, or a bare Gramercy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100491:27"/>
to my good Stars: <hi>Abraham</hi> might
have thought the <hi>Ram</hi> in the thicket
came thither by accident; humane
reaſon would have ſaid, that meer
chance conveyed <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Ark
to the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter:
What a Labyrinth is there in the
ſtory of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> able to convert a
Stoick? Surely there are in every
man's Life certain rubs, doublings
and wrenches, which paſs a while
under the effects of chance, but at
the laſt well examined, prove the
meer hand of God. 'Twas not
dumb chance, that to diſcover the
Fougade or Powder-plot, contrived
a miſcarriage in the Letter. I like
the Victory of 88. the better for
that one occurrence which our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
imputed to our diſhonour, and
the partiality of Fortune, to wit,
the tempeſts and contrariety of
Winds, King <hi>Philip</hi> did not detract
from the Nation, when he ſaid, he
ſent his Armado to fight with men,
and not to combate with the Winds.
Where there is a manifeſt diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between the powers and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100491:27"/>
forces of two ſeveral agents, upon
a Maxime of reaſon we may promiſe
the Victory to the Superiour; but
when unexpected accidents ſlip in,
and unthought of occurrences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene,
theſe muſt proceed from a
power that owes no obedience to
thoſe Axioms: where, as in the
writing upon the wall, we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the hand, but ſee not the ſpring
that moves it. The ſucceſs of that
petty Province of <hi>Holland</hi> (of which
the Grand <hi>Seignour</hi> proudly ſaid, If
they ſhould trouble him as they did
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he would ſend his
men with ſhovels and pick axes,
and throw it into the Sea) I cannot
altogether aſcribe to the ingenuity
and induſtry of the people, but the
mercy of God, that hath diſpoſed
them to ſuch a thriving Genius;
and to the will of his Providence,
that diſpoſeth her favour to each
Country in their pre-ordinate ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
All cannot be happy at once;
for becauſe the glory of one State
depends upon the ruine of another,
there is a revolution and viciſſitude
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100491:28"/>
of their greatneſs, and muſt obey
the ſwing of that wheel, not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
by Intelligences, but by the
hand of God, whereby all Eſtates
ariſe to their <hi>Zenith</hi> and Vertical
points, according to their predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
periods. For the lives, not
only of men, but of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
and the whole World,
run not upon a Helix that ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth;
but on a Circle, where
arriving to their Meridian, they
decline in obſcurity, and fall under
the Horizon again.</p>

the effects of Fortune, but in
a relative way, and as we term the
works of Nature: it was the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of mans reaſon that begat this
very name, and by a careleſs term
miſcalled the Providence of God:
for there is no liberty for cauſes to
operate in a looſe and ſtragling
way; nor any effect whatſoever,
but hath its warrant from ſome uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
or ſuperiour Cauſe. 'Tis not
a ridiculous devotion to ſay a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
before a game at Tables; for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100491:28"/>
even in <hi>ſortiligies</hi> and matters of
greateſt uncertainty, there is a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and pre-ordered courſe of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
It is we that are blind, not
Fortune: becauſe our Eye is too dim
to diſcover the myſtery of her ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
we fooliſhly paint her blind,
and hoodwink the Providence of
the Almighty. I cannot juſtifie
that contemptible Proverb, <hi>That

cut of the reach of Fortune;</hi> much
leſs thoſe opprobrious Epithets of
Poets, <hi>Whore, Bawd,</hi> and <hi>Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</hi>
'Tis, I confeſs, the common
fate of men of ſingular gifts of mind,
to be deſtitute of thoſe of Fortune;
which doth not any way deject the
Spirit of wiſer judgements, who
throughly underſtand the juſtice of
this proceeding; and being inrich'd
with higher donatives, caſt a more
careleſs eye on theſe vulgar parts of
felicity. It is a moſt unjuſt ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to deſire to engroſs the mercies
of the Almighty, not to be content
with the goods of mind, without
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100491:29"/>
a poſſeſſion of thoſe of body or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
and it is an error worſe than
hereſie, to adore theſe complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and circumſtantial pieces of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
and undervalue thoſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and eſſential points of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
wherein we reſemble our
Maker. To wiſer deſires it is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
enough to deſerve, though
not to enjoy the favours of Fortune;
let Providence provide for Fools:
'tis not partiality, but equity in
God, who deals with us but as our
natural Parents; thoſe that are able
of Body and Mind, he leaves to their
deſerts; to thoſe of weaker merits
he imparts a larger portion, and
pieces out the defect of one, by the
acceſs of the other. Thus have we
no juſt quarrel with Nature, for
leaving us naked; or to envy the
Horns, Hoofs, Skins and Furs of
other Creatures, being provided
with Reaſon, that can ſupply them
all. We need not labour with ſo
many Arguments to confute Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Aſtrology; for if there be a truth
therein, it doth not injure Divinity:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100491:29"/>
if to be born under <hi>Mercury</hi> diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
us to be witty, under <hi>Jupiter</hi> to
be wealthy; I do not owe a Knee
unto theſe, but unto that merciful
Hand that hath ordered my indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and uncertain nativity unto
ſuch benevolous Aſpects. Thoſe
that hold that all things are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Fortune, had not erred, had
they not perſiſted there: The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
that erected a Temple to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,

all things begin and end in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.

There is, as in Philoſophy,
ſo in Divinity, ſturdy doubts, and
boiſterous Objections, wherewith
the unhappineſs of our knowledge
too nearly acquainteth us. More
of theſe no man hath known than
my ſelf, which I confeſs I conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not in a martial poſture, but
on my Knees. For our endeavours
are not only to combat with doubts,
but always to diſpute with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:
the villany of that Spirit takes
a hint of Infidelity from our Studies,
and by demonſtrating a naturality
in one way, makes us miſtruſt a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
in another. Thus having, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed
the <hi>Archidoxes,</hi> and read the
ſecret Sympathies of things, he
would diſſwade my belief from the
miracle of the Brazen Serpent, make
me conceit that Image worked by
Sympathy, and was but an <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
trick to cure their Diſeaſes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100491:31"/>
without a miracle. Again, having
ſeen ſome experiments of <hi>Bitumen,</hi>
and having read far more of <hi>Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi>
he whiſpered to my curioſity
the fire of the Altar might be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
and bid me miſtruſt a miracle
in <hi>Elias,</hi> when he entrenched the
Altar round with Water: for that
inflamable ſubſtance yields not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
unto Water, but flames in the
Arms of its Antagoniſt. And thus
would he inveagle my belief to
think the combuſtion of <hi>Sodom</hi>
might be natural, and that there
was an Aſphaltick and Bituminous
nature in that Lake before the Fire
of <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> I know that <hi>Manna</hi>
is now plentifully gathered in <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria;</hi>
and <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells me, in his

the Devil therefore made the <hi>quaere,</hi>
Where was then the miracle in the

Thus the Devil played at Cheſs

That doctrine of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied

the immutable Law of his will.
Thoſe that heretofore denied the

been condemned, but as Hereticks;
and thoſe that now deny our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

are not ſo much as Atheiſts: for

iſſue of <hi>Jacob,</hi> once ſo devoted

ſeduced to the Idolatry of their

unto their own Doctrine expect
impoſſibilities, and in the face and
eye of the Church, perſiſt without
the leaſt hope of Converſion. This
is a vice in them, that were a vertue
in us; for obſtinacy in a bad Cauſe,
is but conſtancy in a good. And
herein I muſt accuſe thoſe of my
own Religion; for there is not any
of ſuch a fugitive Faith, ſuch an
unſtable belief, as a Chriſtian;
none that do ſo oft transform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
not unto ſeveral ſhapes of
Chriſtianity and of the ſame Species,
but unto more unnatural and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Forms, of Jew and Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
that from the name of Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
can condeſcend to the bare
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100491:38"/>
term of Prophet; and from an old
belief that he is come, fall to a
new expectation of his coming. It
is the promiſe of Chriſt to make us
all one Flock; but how and when
this Union ſhall be, is as obſcure to
me as the laſt day. Of thoſe four
Members of Religion we hold a
ſlender proportion; there are, I
confeſs, ſome new additions, yet
ſmall to thoſe which accrew to our
Adverſaries, and thoſe only drawn
from the revolt of Pagans, men
but of negative Impieties, and ſuch
as deny Chriſt, but becauſe they
never heard of him: but the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Jew is expreſly againſt the
Chriſtian, and the Mahometan
againſt both. For * the Turk, in
the bulk he now ſtands, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all hope of converſion:] if he
fall aſunder, there may be conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hopes, but not without ſtrong
improbabilities. The Jew is obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in all fortunes; the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of fifteen hundred years hath
but confirmed them in their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
they have already endured
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100491:38"/>
whatſoever may be inflicted, and
have ſuffered, in a bad cauſe, even
to the condemnation of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Perſecution is a bad and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
way to plant Religion; It
hath been the unhappy method of
angry Devotions, not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
honeſt Religion, but wicked
Hereſies, and extravagant Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It was the firſt ſtone and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
of our Faith,* none can more
juſtly boaſt of Perſecutions, and
glory in the number and valour of
Martyrs;] For, to ſpeak properly,
thoſe are true and almoſt only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of fortitude: Thoſe that
are fetch'd from the field, or drawn
from the actions of the Camp, are
not oft-times ſo truely precedents
of valour as audacity, and at the
beſt attain but to ſome baſtard piece
of fortitude: ‖ If we ſhall ſtrictly
examine the circumſtances and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites
which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> requires to
true and perfect valour, we ſhall
find the name only in his Maſter
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and as little in that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Worthy, <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi>] and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100491:39"/>
if any, in that eaſie and active way,
have done ſo nobly as to deſerve
that name, yet in the paſſive and
more terrible piece theſe have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed,
and in a more heroical way
may claim the honour of that Title.
'Tis not in the power of every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

every one hath it not in that full

that may have ſome truth in it

They may eaſily believe thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles

which he wrought in <hi>Cana,</hi> or what
the Devil would have had him done
in the Wilderneſs, of Stones into
Bread, compared to this, will ſcarce
deſerve the name of a Miracle.
Though indeed to ſpeak properly,
there is not one Miracle greater
than another, they being the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
effects of the Hand of God,
to which all things are of an equal
facility; and to create the World as
eaſie as one ſingle Creature. For this
is alſo a Miracle, not onely to produce
effects againſt, or above Nature, but
before Nature; and to create Nature
as great a Miracle, as to contradict
or tranſcend her. We do too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly

Spirits and Witches; how ſo many

they that doubt of theſe do not

are obliquely, and upon conſequence

puzleth me more than the Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demain

credit thoſe transformations of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable

the Devil hath a power to tranſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
a man into a Horſe, who tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chriſt (as a trial of his Divinity)
to convert but ſtones into bread. I
could believe that Spirits uſe with
man the act of carnality, and that in
both ſexes; I conceive they may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
ſteal, or contrive a body,
wherein there may be action enough
to content decrepit luſt, or paſſion

in both, without a poſſibility of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:

without his advice, they proceeding

thoſe eſſences that know not the

that gentle heat that brooded on the

diſpels the miſts of Hell, the clouds

preſerves the region of the mind in

there is no hereſie in it, and if not
manifeſtly defin'd in Scripture, yet
is an opinion of a good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

<hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to ſalve many doubts,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100491:45"/>
whereof common Philoſophy afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no ſolution. Now if you demand
my opinion and Metaphyſicks of
their natures, I confeſs them very
ſhallow, moſt of them in a negative
way, like that of God; or in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative,
between our ſelves and
fellow-creatures; for there is in this
Univerſe a Stair, or manifeſt Scale
of creatures, riſing not diſorderly, or
in confuſion, but with a comely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and proportion. Between crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of meer exiſtence and things of
life, there is a large diſproportion of
nature; between plants and animals
of creatures of ſenſe, a wider diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
between them and man, a far
greater: and if the proportion hold
one, between Man an Angels there
ſhould be yet a greater. We do not
comprehend their natures, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the firſt definition of <hi>Porphyry,</hi>
and diſtinguiſh them from our ſelves
by immortality; for before his Fall,
'tis thought, Man alſo was Immortal;
yet muſt we needs affirm that he
had a different eſſence from the
Angels; having therefore no certain
knowledge of their Natures, 'tis no
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100491:46"/>
bad method of the Schools, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
perfection we find obſcurely in
our ſelves, in a more compleat and
abſolute way to aſcribe unto them. I
believe they have an extemporary
knowledge, and upon the firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their reaſon do what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
without ſtudy or deliberation;
that they know things by their
forms, and define by ſpecifical diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
what we deſcribe by accidents
and properties; and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities
to us may be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
unto them: that they have
knowledge not onely of the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical,

(beſides the relation to its ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)

as the Soul hath a power to move
the body it informs, ſo there's a
faculty to move any, though inform
none; ours upon reſtraint of time,

that intuitive knowledge, whereby
as in reflexion they behold the
thoughts of one another, I cannot
peremptorily deny but they know
a great part of ours. They that to
refute the Invocation of Saints, have
denied that they have any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

what we are but in hopes, and

form that links thoſe two together,
and makes good the Method of God
and Nature, that jumps not from
extreams, but unites the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
diſtances by ſome middle and
participating natures: that we are
the breath and ſimilitude of God, it
is indiſputable, and upon record of
holy Scripture; but to call our
ſelves a Microcoſm, or little World, I
thought it onely a pleaſant trope of
Rhetorick, till my neer judgement
and ſecond thoughts told me there
was a real truth therein: for firſt
we are a rude maſs, and in the rank
of creatures, which onely are, and
have a dull kind of being not yet
priviledged with life, or preferred
to ſenſe or reaſon; next we live the
life of Plants, the life of Animals,
the life of Men, and at laſt the life of
Spirits, running on in one myſterious
nature thoſe five kinds of exiſtences,
which comprehend the creatures not
onely of the World, but of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100491:47"/>
thus is man that great and true
<hi>Amphibium,</hi> whoſe nature is diſpoſed
to live not onely like other creatures
in divers elements, but in divided
and diſtinguiſhed worlds: for though
there be but one to ſenſe, there are
two to reaſon; the one viſible, the
other inviſible, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems
to have left deſcription, and of the
other ſo obſcurely, that ſome parts
thereof are yet in controverſie. And
truely for the firſt chapters of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi>
I muſt confeſs a great deal of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity;
though Divines have to the
power of humane reaſon endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make all go in a literal mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet thoſe allegorical interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are alſo probable, and perhaps
the myſtical method of <hi>Moſes</hi> bred
up in the Hieroglyphical Schools
of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for that immaterial world,
methinks we need not wander ſo far
as beyond the firſt moveable; for
even in this material Fabrick the
ſpirits walk as freely exempt from
the affection of time, place, and
motion, as beyond the extreameſt
circumference: do but extract from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100491:48"/>
the corpulency of bodies, or reſolve
things beyond their firſt matter, and
you diſcover the habitation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
which if I call the ubiquitary,
and omnipreſent eſſence of God, I
hope I ſhall not offend Divinity: for
before the Creation of the World,
God was really all things. For the
Angels he created no new World,
or determinate manſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are everywhere where is
his Eſſence, and do live at a diſtance
even in himſelf. That God made all
things for man, is in ſome ſenſe true,
yet not ſo far as to ſubordinate the
Creation of thoſe purer Creatures
unto ours, though as miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
they do, and are willing to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
the will of God in theſe lower
and ſublunary affairs of man: God
made all things for himſelf, and it is
impoſſible he ſhould make them for
any other end than his own Glory;
it is all he can receive, and all that
is without himſelf: for honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an external adjunct, and in the
honourer rather than in the perſon
honoured, it was neceſſary to make
a Creature, from whom he might
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100491:48"/>
receive his homage, and that is in
the other world Angels, in this, Man;
which when we neglect, we forget
the very end of our Creation, and
may juſtly provoke God, not onely
to repent that he hath made the
World, but that he hath ſworn he
would not deſtroy it. That there is
but one World, is a concluſion of
Faith. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> with all his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
hath not been able to prove it,
and as weakly that the world was
eternal; that diſpute much troubled
the Pen of the Philoſophers, * but
<hi>Moſes</hi> decided that queſtion, and all
is ſalved with the new term of a
Creation,] that is, a production of
ſomething out of nothing; and what
is that? Whatſoever is oppoſite to
ſomething; or more exactly, that
which is truely contrary unto God:
for he onely is, all others have an
exiſtence with dependency, and
are ſometime but by a diſtinction;
and herein is Divinity conformant
unto Philoſophy, and generation not
onely founded on contrarieties, but
alſo creation; God being all things,
is contrary unto nothing, out of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100491:49"/>
which were made all things, and ſo
nothing became ſomething, and
<hi>Omniety</hi> informed <hi>Nullity</hi> into an
Eſſence.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>36</label> The whole Creation is a Myſtery,
and particularly that of Man; at the
blaſt of his mouth were the reſt of
the Creatures made, and at his bare
word they ſtarted out of nothing:
but in the frame of man (as the
Text deſcribes it) he played the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
operator, and ſeemed not ſo
much to create, as make him; when
he had ſeparated the materials of
other creatures, there conſequently
reſulted a form and ſoul; but having
raiſed the walls of man, he has driven
to a ſecond and harder creation
of a ſubſtance like himſelf, an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
and immortal Soul. For
theſe two affections we have the
Philoſophy and opinion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
the flat affirmative of <hi>Plato,</hi>
and not a negative from <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi>
there is another ſcruple caſt in by
Divinity (concerning its production)
much diſputed in the <hi>Germane</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditories,
and with that indifferency
and equality of arguments, as leave
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100491:49"/>
the controverſie undetermined. I am
not of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> mind, that boldly
delivers a receipt to make a man
without conjunction; yet cannot
but wonder at the multitude of
heads that do deny traduction, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no other argument to confirm
their belief, then that Rhetorical
ſentence, and <hi>Antimetatheſis</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,
Creando infunditur, infun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo
creatur:</hi> either opinion will
conſiſt well enough with Religion;
yet I ſhould rather incline to this,
did not one objection haunt me, not
wrung from ſpeculations and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties,
but from common ſenſe, and
obſervation; not pickt from the
leaves of any Author, but bred
amongſt the weeds and tares of mine
own brain: And this is a concluſion
from the equivocal and monſtrous
productions in the copulation of a
Man with a Beaſt; for if the Soul of
man be not tranſmitted, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
in the ſeed of the Parents,
why are not thoſe productions meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beaſts, but have alſo an impreſſion
and tincture of reaſon in as high a
meaſure, as it can evidence it ſelf
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100491:50"/>
in thoſe improper Organs? Nor
truely can I peremptorily deny, that
the Soul in this her ſublunary eſtate,
is wholly, and in all acceptions inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical,
but that for the performance
of her ordinary actions, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
not onely a ſymmetry and
proper diſpoſition of Organs, but a
Craſis and temper correſpondent to
its operations. Yet is not this maſs of
fleſh and viſible ſtructure the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and proper corps of the Soul,
but rather of Senſe, and that the
hand of Reaſon. * In our ſtudy of
Anatomy there is a maſs of myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Philoſophy, and ſuch as reduced
the very Heathens to Divinity:] yet
amongſt all thoſe rare diſcourſes,
and curious pieces I find in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of man, I do not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelf, as in that I find not,
there is no Organ or Inſtrument for
the rational ſoul: for in the brain,
which we term the ſeat of reaſon,
there is not any thing of moment
more than I can diſcover in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of a beaſt: and this is a ſenſible
and no inconſiderable argument of
the inorganity of the Soul, at leaſt in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100491:50"/>
that ſenſe we uſually ſo conceive it.
Thus we are men, and we know not
how; there is ſomething in us that
can be without us, and will be after
us, though it is ſtrange that it hath
no hiſtory, what it was before us, nor
cannot tell how it entred in us.</p>

that of <hi>Nebuchodonoſor</hi> proceeded
not ſo far; in all others I conceive
there is no further verity than is
contained in their implicite ſenſe and
morality. I believe that the whole
frame of a beaſt doth periſh, and is
left in the tame ſlate after death, as
before it was materialled unto life;
that the ſouls of men know neither
contrary nor corruption; that they
ſubſiſt beyond the body, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
death by the priviledge of their

that the Souls of the faithful,
as they leave Earth, take poſſeſſion
of Heaven; that thoſe apparitions

not the wandring ſouls of men,

prompting and ſuggeſting us unto

raking into the bowels of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
continual ſight of Anatomies,
Skeletons, or Cadaverous reliques,
like Veſpilloes, or Grave-makers, I
am become ſtupid, or have forgot

I find not any thing therein able
to daunt the courage of a man,

And therefore am not angry at the

Death, I do conceive my ſelf the

there not another life that I hope
for, all the vanities of this World
ſhould not intreat a moments breath
from me: could the Devil work my
belief to imagine I could never dye,
I would not outlive that very
thought; I have ſo abject a conceit
of this common way of exiſtence,
this retaining to the Sun and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I cannot think this is to be
a man, or to live according to the
dignity of humanity: in exſpectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

love a Souldier, and honour thoſe
tattered and contemptible Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that will dye at the command
of a Sergeant. For a Pagan there
may be ſome motives to be in love
with life; but for a Chriſtian to be
amazed at death, I ſee not how he

For beſides that general and

to hold in our Chaos, and whilſt we
ſleep within the boſome of our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100491:53"/>

three diſtinct worlds, wherein we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
moſt manifeſt graduations: In
that obſcure World and womb of our
mother, our time is ſhort, computed
by the Moon; yet longer then the
days of many creatures that behold
the Sun, our ſelves being not yet
without life, ſenſe, and reaſon;
though for the manifeſtation of its
actions, it awaits the opportunity of
objects, and ſeems to live there but
in its root and ſoul of vegetation;
entring afterwards upon the ſcene of
the World, we ariſe up and become
another creature, performing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
actions of man, and obſcurely
manifeſting that part of Divinity in
us, but not in complement and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
till we have once more caſt
our ſecondine, that is, this ſlough of
fleſh, and are delivered into the laſt
world, that is, that ineffable place

Were there any hopes to outlive
vice, or a point to be ſuper-annuated
from ſin, it were worthy our knees

But age doth not rectifie, but incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
our natures, turning bad diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100491:55"/>
into worſer habits, and (like
diſeaſes) brings on incurable vices;
for every day as we grow weaker
in age, we grow ſtronger in ſin; and
the number of our days doth but
make our ſins innumerable. The
ſame vice committed at ſixteen, is
not the ſame, though it agrees in all
other circumſtances, as at forty, but
ſwells and doubles from that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of our ages, wherein, beſides
the conſtant and inexcuſable habit
of tranſgreſſing, the maturity of our
judgement cuts off pretence unto
excuſe or pardon: every ſin the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it is committed, the more it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
in the quality of evil; as it
ſucceeds in time, ſo it proceeds in
degrees of badneſs; for as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
they ever multiply, and like fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
in Arithmetick, the laſt ſtands
for more than all that went before it.
And though I think no man can live
well once, but he that could live
twice, yet for my own part I would
not live over my hours paſt, or begin
again the thred of my days:* not
upon <hi>Cicero</hi>'s ground, becauſe I have

Judgment daily inſtruct me how to
be better, but my untamed affections
and confirmed vitioſity makes me
daily do worſe; I find in my confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

my youth; I committed many then
becauſe I was a Child, and becauſe I
commit them ſtill, I am yet an infant.
Therefore I perceive a man may be

no farther than their outſides, think
health an appurtenance unto life,
and quarrel with their conſtitutions
for being ſick; but I that have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the parts of man, and know
upon what tender filaments that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
hangs, do wonder that we are
not always ſo; and conſidering the
thouſand doors that lead to death,
do thank my God that we can die
but once. 'Tis not onely the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of diſeaſes, and villany of
poyſons, that make an end of us;
we vainly accuſe the fury of Guns,
and the new inventions of death; it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100491:58"/>
is in the power of every hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
us, and we are beholding unto
every one we meet, he doth not kill
us. There is therefore but one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
left, that though it be in the
power of the weakeſt arm to take
away life, it is not in the ſtrongeſt to
deprive us of death: God would
not exempt himſelf from that, the
miſery of immortality in the fleſh;
he undertook not that was immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
Certainly there is no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
within this circle of fleſh, nor
is it in the Opticks of theſe eyes to
behold felicity; the firſt day of our
Jubilee is Death; the Devil hath
therefore failed of his deſires; we
are happier with death than we
ſhould have been without it: there
is no miſery but in himſelf, where
there is no end of miſery; and ſo
indeed in his own ſenſe, the Stoick is
in the right. He forgets that he can
dye who complains of miſery; we
are in the power of no calamity

I believe the World grows near its

nor ſhall ever periſh upon the ruines

of Creation was above nature, ſo its
adverſary annihilation; without
which the World hath not its end,
but its mutation. Now what force
ſhould be able to conſume it thus
far, without the breath of God,

confirmable by ſenſe, yet not

that our ſeparated duſt after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Pilgrimages and transformations
into the parts of Minerals, Plants,
Animals, Elements, ſhall at the Voice
of God return into their primitive
ſhapes, and joyn again to make
up their primary and predeſtinate
forms. As at the Creation there was
a ſeparation of that confuſed maſs
into its pieces; ſo at the deſtruction
thereof there ſhall be a ſeparation
into its diſtinct individuals. As at
the Creation of the World, all the
diſtinct ſpecies that we behold, lay
involved in one maſs, till the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Voice of God ſeparated this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
multitude into its ſeveral ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
ſo at the laſt day, when thoſe
corrupted reliques ſhall be ſcattered
in the Wilderneſs of forms, and
ſeem to have forgot their proper
habits,* God by a powerful Voice
ſhall command them back into their
proper ſhapes,] and call them out
by their ſingle individuals: Then
ſhall appear the fertility of <hi>Adam,</hi>
and the magick of that ſperm that
hath dilated into ſo many millions.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100491:62"/>
I have often beheld as a miracle,
that artificial reſurrection and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of <hi>Mercury,</hi> how being
mortified into a thouſand ſhapes, it
aſſumes again its own, and returns
into its numerical ſelf. Let us ſpeak
naturally, and like Philoſophers,
the forms of alterable bodies in theſe
ſenſible corruptions periſh not; nor
as we imagine, wholly quit their
manſions, but retire and contract
themſelves into their ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible
parts, where they may beſt
protect themſelves from the action
of their Antagoniſt. A plant or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
conſumed to aſhes, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
and ſchool-Philoſopher
ſeems utterly deſtroyed, and the
form to have taken his leave for
ever: But to a ſenſible Artiſt the
forms are not periſhed, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
into their incombuſtible part,
where they lie ſecure from the action
of that devouring element. This is
made good by experience, which
can from the Aſhes of a Plant revive
the plant, and from its cinders recal
it into its ſtalk and leaves again.
What the Art of man can do in theſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100491:63"/>
inferiour pieces, what blaſphemy is
it to affirm the finger of God cannot
do in theſe more perfect and ſenſible
ſtructures? This is that myſtical
Philoſophy, from whence no true
Scholar becomes an Atheiſt, but
from the viſible effects of nature
grows up a real Divine; and beholds
not in a dream, as <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> but in an
ocular and viſible object the types of
his reſurrection.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>49</label> Now, the neceſſary Manſions of
our reſtored ſelves, are thoſe two
contrary and incompatible places
we call Heaven and Hell; to define
them, or ſtrictly to determine what
and where theſe are, ſurpaſſeth my
Divinity. That elegant Apoſtle
which ſeemed to have a glimpſe of
Heaven, hath left but a negative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
thereof; <hi>which neither eye
hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor can
enter into the heart of man:</hi> he was
tranſlated out of himſelf to behold
it; but being returned into himſelf,
could not expreſs it. St. <hi>John</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
by Emerals, Chryſolites,
and precious Stones, is too weak to
expreſs the material Heaven we
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100491:63"/>
behold. Briefly therefore, where
the Soul hath the full meaſure, and
complement of happineſs; where
the boundleſs appetite of that ſpirit
remains compleatly ſatisfied, that it
can neither deſire addition nor alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that I think is truly Heaven:
and this can onely be in the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that eſſence, whoſe infinite
goodneſs is able to terminate the
deſires of it ſelf, and the unſatiable
wiſhes of ours; wherever God will
thus manifeſt himſelf, there is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
though within the circle of this
ſenſible world. Thus the Soul of man
may be in Heaven any where, even
within the limits of his own proper
body; and when it ceaſeth to live in
the body, it may remain in its own
ſoul, that is, its Creator. And thus we
may ſay that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whether in the
body, or out of the body, was yet
in Heaven. To place it in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreal,
or beyond the tenth ſphear,
is to forget, the worlds deſtruction;
for when this ſenſible world ſhall be
deſtroyed, all ſhall then be here as
it is now there, an Empyreal Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>a quaſi</hi> vacuity; when to ask
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100491:64"/>
where Heaven is, is to demand where
the Preſence of God is, or where we
have the glory of that happy viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Moſes</hi> that was bred up in all
the learning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a groſs abſurdity in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
when with theſe eyes of fleſh he
deſired to ſee God, and petitioned
his Maker, that is truth it ſelf, to a
contradiction. Thoſe that imagine
Heaven and Hell neighbours, and
conceive a vicinity between thoſe
two extreams, upon conſequence of
the Parable, where <hi>Dives</hi> diſcourſed
with <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome,
do too groſly conceive of thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
creatures, whoſe eyes ſhall
eaſily out-ſee the Sun, and behold
without a perſpective the extreameſt
diſtances? for if there ſhall be in our
glorified eyes, the faculty of ſight
and reception of objects, I could
think the viſible ſpecies there to be
in as unlimitable a way as now the
intellectual. I grant that two bodies
placed beyond the tenth ſphear, of
in a vacuity, according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s
Philoſophy, could not behold each
other, becauſe there wants a body
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100491:64"/>
or Medium to hand and tranſport
the viſible rays of the object unto
the ſenſe; but when there ſhall be a
general defect of either Medium to
convey, or light to prepare and
diſpoſe that Medium, and yet a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
viſion, we muſt ſuſpend the rules
of our Philoſophy, and make all
good by a more abſolute piece of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                  <p>I cannot tell how to ſay that fire
is the eſſence of Hell; I know not
what to make of Purgatory,* or
conceive a flame that can either
prey upon, or purifie the ſubſtance
of a Soul:] thoſe flames of ſulphur
mention'd in the Scriptures, I take
not to be underſtood of this preſent
Hell, but of that to come, where fire
ſhall make up the complement of
our tortures, and have a body or
ſubject wherein to manifeſt its ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
Some who have had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be textuary in Divinity, are
of opinion it ſhall be the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical
fire with ours. This is hard
to conceive, yet can I make good
how even that may prey upon our
bodies, and yet not conſume us: for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100491:65"/>
in this material World, there are bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that perſiſt invincible in the
powerfulleſt flames; and though by
the action of fire they fall into igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and liquation, yet will they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuffer a deſtruction. I would
gladly know how <hi>Moſes</hi> with an
actual fire calcin'd, or burnt the
Golden Calf unto powder: for that
myſtical metal of Gold, whoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
and celeſtial nature I admire,
expoſed unto the violence of fire,
grows onely hot and liquifies, but
conſumaeth not: ſo when the conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mble
and volatile pieces of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ſhall be refined into a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
and fixed temper, like
Gold, though they ſuffer from the
actions of flames, they ſhall never
periſh, but lye immortal in the arms
of fire. And ſurely if this frame muſt
ſuffer onely by the action of this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there will many bodies eſcape,
and not onely Heaven, but Earth will
not be at an end, but rather a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
For at preſent it is not earth,
but a compoſition of fire, water,
earth, and air; but at that time, ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of theſe ingredients, it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100491:65"/>
in a ſubſtance more like it ſelf,
its aſhes. Philoſophers that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
the worlds deſtruction by fire,
did never dream of annihilation,
which is beyond the power of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
cauſes; for the laſt action
of that element is but vitrification,
or a reduction of a body into glaſs;
and therefore ſome of our Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks
facetiouſly affirm, that at
the laſt fire all ſhall be chriſtallized
and reverberated into glaſs, which
is the utmoſt action of that element.
Nor need we fear this term [annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation]
or wonder that God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the works of his Creation: for
man ſubſiſting, who is, and will then
truely appear a Microcoſm, the
world cannot be ſaid to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100491:66"/>
and fruit thereof: (for things that

God beholds all things, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates

deſcribe Hell in the ſame method
that <hi>Mahomet</hi> doth Heaven. This

to ſtand in diameter with Heaven,
whoſe happineſs conſiſts in that part
that is beſt able to comprehend it,
that immortal eſſence, that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
divinity and colony of God,
the Soul. Surely though we place
Hell under Earth, the Devil's walk
and purlue is about it: men ſpeak
too popularly who place it in thoſe
flaming mountains, which to groſſer
apprehenſions repreſent Hell. The
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100491:66"/>
heart of man is the place the Devils
dwell in; I feel ſometimes a Hell
within my ſelf; <hi>Lucifer</hi> keeps his
Court in my breaſt; <hi>Legion</hi> is revived
in me:* There are as many Hells, as
<hi>Anaxagoras</hi> conceited worlds:] there
was more than one Hell in <hi>Magdalene,</hi>
when there were ſeven Devils; for
every Devil is an Hell unto himſelf;
he holds enough of torture in his

circumference to afflict him. And thus
a diſtracted Conſcience here, is a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
or introduction unto Hell here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Who can but pity the merciful
intention of thoſe hands that do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
themſelves? the Devil, were it
in his power, would do the like;
which being impoſſible, his miſeries
are endleſs, and he ſuffers moſt in
that attribute wherein he is impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
his immortality.</p>

it, I was never afraid of Hell, nor

have almoſt forgot the Idea of Hell,
and am afraid rather to loſe the Joys
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100491:67"/>
of the one, than endure the miſery
of the other; to be deprived of them,
is a perfect Hell, and needs methinks
no addition to compleat our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
that terrible term hath never
detained me from ſin, nor do I owe
any good action to the name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
I fear God, yet am not afraid
of him; his Mercies make me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of my ſins, before his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
afraid thereof: theſe are the
forced and ſecondary method of his
wiſdom, which he uſeth but as the
laſt remedy, and upon provocation;
a courſe rather to deter the wicked,
than incite the virtuous to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
I can hardly think there was ever
any ſcared into Heaven; they go the
faireſt way to Heaven, that would
ſerve God without a Hell; other
Mercenaries, that crouch unto him
in fear of Hell, though they term

but the ſlaves of the Almighty.</p>

when I ſurvey the occurrences of my
life, and call into account the Finger
of God, I can perceive nothing but
an abyſs and maſs of mercies, either
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100491:67"/>
in general to mankind, or in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to my ſelf: and whether out of
the prejudice of my affection, or an
inverting and partial conceit of his
mercies, I know not; but thoſe which
others term croſſes, afflictions, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
misfortunes, to me who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
farther into them then their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
effects, they both appear, and in
event have ever proved the ſecret
and diſſembled favours of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It is a ſingular piece of Wiſdom
to apprehend truly, and without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
the Works of God; and ſo well
to diſtinguiſh his Juſtice from his
Mercy, as not miſcall thoſe noble
Attributes: yet it is likewiſe an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
piece of Logick, ſo to diſpute
and argue the proceedings of God,
as to diſtinguiſh even his judgments
into mercies. For God is merciful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all, becauſe better to the worſt,
than the beſt deſerve; and to ſay he
puniſheth none in this World, though
it be a Paradox, is no abſurdity. To
one that hath committed Murther, if
the Judge ſhould only ordain a Fine,
it were a madneſs to call this a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to repine at the ſentence,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100491:68"/>
rather than admire the clemency of
the Judge. Thus our offences being
mortal, and deſerving not onely
Death, but Damnation; if the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God be content to traverſe
and paſs them over with a loſs, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
or diſeaſe; what frenſie
were it to term this a puniſhment,
rather than an extremity of mercy;
and to groan under the rod of his
Judgements, rather than admire
the Scepter of his Mercies? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to adore, honour, and admire
him, is a debt of gratitude due
from the obligation of our nature,
ſtates, and conditions; and with
theſe thoughts, he that knows them
beſt, will not deny that I adore him.
That I obtain Heaven, and the bliſs
thereof, is accidental, and not the
intended work of my devotion; it
being a felicity I can neither think
to deſerve, nor ſcarce in modeſty
to expect. For thoſe two ends of
us all, either as rewards or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are mercifully ordained and
diſproportionably diſpoſed unto our
actions; the one being ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

a ſtrange viſion will it be to ſee their

live but in their own kind, as

the preſcript of their natures, and
therefore cannot reaſonably demand

obeying the natural dictates of their
reaſon. It will therefore, and muſt
at laſt appear, that all ſalvation is
through Chriſt; which verity I fear
theſe great examples of virtue muſt
confirm, and make it good, how the

Vice and the Devil put a Fallacy
upon our Reaſons, and provoking us

it is a ſolemnity of good uſe
and conſequence in the State: ‖ But
the Philoſopher that threw his money
into the Sea to avoid Avarice, was
a notorious prodigal.] There is no
road or ready way to virtue; it is
not an eaſie point of art to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle

Again, the Practice of men holds
not an equal pace, yea, and often
runs counter to their Theory; we
naturally know what is good, but
naturally purſue what is evil: the
Rhetorick wherewith I perſwade
another, cannot perſwade my ſelf:
there is a depraved appetite in us,
that will with patience hear the
learned inſtructions of Reaſon, but
yet perform no farther than agrees to
its own irregular humour. In brief,
we all are monſters, that is, a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100491:70"/>
to have the Region of Man above

affirm with men, that few ſhall know
Salvation; that the bridge is narrow,
the paſſage ſtraight unto life: yet
thoſe who do confine the Church of
God, either to particular Nations,

he had Conquer'd all the World,
when he had not ſubdued the half of

deny the Church of God both in

the Peregrinations of the Apoſtles,
the deaths of the Martyrs, the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of many, and, even in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
judgement, lawful Councils,
held in thoſe parts in the minority
and nonage of ours. Nor muſt a few
differences, more remarkable in the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100491:71"/>
eyes of man, than perhaps in the
judgement of God, excommunicate
from Heaven one another, much leſs
thoſe Chriſtians who are in a manner
all Martyrs, maintaining their Faith,
in the noble way of perfecution, and
ſerving God in the Fire, whereas we
honour him in the Sunſhine. 'Tis
true, we all hold there is a number
of Elect, and many to be ſaved; yet
take our Opinions together, and
from the confuſion thereof there will
be no ſuch thing as ſalvation, nor
ſhall any one be ſaved. For firſt, the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> condemneth us, we
likewiſe them; the Sub-reformiſts
and Sectaries ſentence the Doctrine
of our Church as damnable; the
Atomiſt, or Familiſt, reprobates all
theſe; and all theſe, them again. Thus
whilſt the Mercies of God do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
us Heaven, our conceits and
opinions exclude us from that place.
There muſt be therefore more than
one St. <hi>Peter;</hi> particular Churches
and Sects uſurp the gates of Heaven,
and turn the key againſt each other:
and thus we go to Heaven againſt
each others wills, conceits and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100491:71"/>
and with as much uncharity

<hi>Before Abraham was, I am,</hi> is the

for I was not onely before my ſelf,
but <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, in the Idea of God,
and the decree of that Synod held
from all Eternity. And in this ſenſe,
I ſay, the World was before the
Creation, and at an end before it had
a beginning; and thus was I dead

Works, and rely onely upon Faith,
take not away merit: for depending
upon the efficacy of their Faith, they
enforce the condition of God, and
in a more ſophiſtical way do ſeem to
challenge Heaven. It was decreed by
God, that only thoſe that lapt in the
water like Dogs, ſhould have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

could none of thoſe juſtly challenge,
or imagine he deſerved that honour

true Faith, and ſuch as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
is not onely a mark or token,
but alſo a means of our Salvation;
but where to find this, is as obſcure
to me, as my laſt end. And if our
Saviour could object unto his own
Diſciples and Favourites, a Faith,
that, to the quantity of a grain of

I have ever endeavoured to nouriſh
the merciful diſpoſition and humane

and regulate it to the written
and preſcribed Laws of Charity; and
if I hold the true Anatomy of my
ſelf, I am delineated and naturally
framed to ſuch a piece of virtue. For
I am of a conſtitution ſo general,
that it comforts and ſympathizeth
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100491:74"/>
with all things; I have no antipathy,
or rather Idio-ſyncraſie, in dyet, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
air, any thing: * I wonder
not at the <hi>French</hi> for their diſhes of
Frogs, Snails,] and Toadſtools; not
at the Jews for Locuſts and Graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers;
but being amongſt them,
make them my common Viands; and
I find they agree with my Stomach
as well as theirs. I could digeſt a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad
gathered in a Church-yard, as
well as in a Garden. I cannot ſtart at
the preſence of a Serpent, Scorpion,
Lizard, or Salamander: at the ſight
of a Toad or Viper, I find in me no
deſire to take up a ſtone to deſtroy
them. I feell not in my ſelf thoſe
common Antipathies that I can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
in others: Thoſe National re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnances
do not touch me, nor do
I behold with prejudice the <hi>French,
Italian, Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> but
where I find their actions in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
with my Country-men's, I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
love, and embrace them in ſome
degree. I was born in the eighth
Climate, but ſeem for to be framed
and conſtellated unto all: I am no
Plant that will not proſper out of a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100491:74"/>
Garden: All places, all airs make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me one Countrey; I am in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
every where, and under any
Meridian. I have been ſhipwrackt,
yet am not enemy with the Sea or
Winds; I can ſtudy, play, or ſleep in
a Tempeſt. In brief, I am averſe
from nothing; my Conſcience would
give me the lye if I ſhould abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
deteſt or hate any eſſence but
the Devil; or ſo at leaſt abhor any
thing, but that we might come to
compoſition. If there be any among
thoſe common objects of hatred I
do contemn and laugh at, it is that
great enemy of Reaſon, Virtue and
Religion, the Multitude; that nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
piece of monſtroſity, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
aſunder ſeem men, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creatures of God; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
together, make but one great
beaſt, and a monſtroſity more prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
then Hydra: it is no breach
of Charity to call theſe Fools; it is
the ſtyle all holy Writers have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
them, ſet down by <hi>Solomon</hi>
in Canonical Scripture, and a point
of our Faith to believe ſo. Neither
in name of Multitude do I onely
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100491:75"/>
include the baſe and minor ſort of
people; there is a rabble even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Gentry, a ſort of Plebeian
heads, whoſe fancy moves with the
ſame wheel as theſe; men in the
ſame Level with Mechanicks, though
their fortunes do ſomewhat guild
their infirmities, and their purſes
compound for their follies. But as in
caſting account, three or four men
together come ſhort in account of
one man placed by himſelf below
them: So neither are a troop of
theſe ignorant Doradoes, of that true
eſteem and value, as many a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
perſon, whoſe condition doth
place them below their feet. Let us
ſpeak like Politicians, there is a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
without Heraldry, a natural
dignity, whereby one man is ranked
with another; another filed before
him, according to the quality of his
Deſert, and preheminence of his
good parts: Though the corruption
of theſe times, and the byas of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

Thus it was in the firſt and primitive
Common-wealths, and is yet in the

diſpoſe me to this noble virtue. It
is a happineſs to be born and framed
unto virtue, and to grow up from
the ſeeds of nature. rather than the
inoculation and forced graffs of
education: yet if we are directed
only by our particular Natures, and
regulate our inclinations by no
higher rule than that of our reaſons,
we are but Moraliſts; Divinity will
ſtill call us Heathens, Therefore
this great work of charity, muſt have
other motives, ends, and impulſions:
I give no alms only to ſatisfie the
hunger of my Brother, but to fulfil
and accompliſh the Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of my God; I draw not my
purſe for his ſake that demands it,
but his that enjoyned it; I relieve
no man upon the Rhetorick of his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100491:76"/>
miſeries, nor to content mine own
commiſerating diſpoſition: for this
is ſtill but moral charity, and an act
that oweth more to paſſion than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
He that relieves another upon
the bare ſuggeſtion and bowels of
pity, doth not this ſo much for his
ſake, as for his own: for by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
we make others miſery our
own; and ſo by relieving them, we
relieve our ſelves alſo. It is as errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a conceit to redreſs other Mens
misfortunes upon the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
or merciful natures, that
it may be one day our own caſe;
for this is a ſiniſter and politick kind
of charity, whereby we ſeem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak
the pities of men in the like
occaſions: and truly I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that thoſe profeſſed Eleemoſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
though in a croud or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
do yet direct and place their
petitions on a few and ſelected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
there is ſurely a Phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which thoſe experienced and
Maſter-Mendicants obſerve; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they inſtantly diſcover a merciful
aſpect, and will ſingle out a face,
wherein they ſpy the ſignatures and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100491:76"/>
marks of Mercy: for there are myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
in our faces certain Characters
which carry in them the motto of
our Souls, wherein he that can read
<hi>A. B. C.</hi> may read our natures. I hold
moreover that there is a Phytogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
or Phyſiognomy, not only of
Men; but of Plants and Vegetables;
and in every one of them, ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
figures which hang as ſigns or
buſhes of their inward forms. The
Finger of God hath left an Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon all his works, not graphical,
or compoſed of Letters, but of their
ſeveral forms, conſtitutions, parts,
and operations; which aptly joyned
together do make one word that
doth expreſs their natures. By theſe
Letters God calls the Stars by their
names; and by this Alphabet <hi>Adam</hi>
aſſigned to every creature a name
peculiar to its Nature. Now there
are beſides theſe Characters in our
Faces, certain myſtical figures in our
Hands, which I dare not call meer
daſhes, ſtrokes, <hi>a la volee,</hi> or at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
becauſe delineated by a Pencil
that never works in vain; and hereof
I take more particular notice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100491:77"/>
I carry that in mine own hand,
which I could never read of, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
in another. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> I confeſs,
in his acute, and ſingular Book of
Phyſiognomy, hath made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chiromancy; yet I believe
the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were neerer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to thoſe abſtruſe and myſtical
ſciences, had a knowledge therein;
to which thoſe vagabond and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<hi>Egyptians</hi> did after pretend,
and perhaps retained a few corrupted
principles, which ſometimes might
verifie their prognoſticks.</p>
                  <p>It is the common wonder of all
men, * how among ſo many millions
of faces, there ſhould be none alike:]
Now contrary, I wonder as much
how there ſhould be any. He that
ſhall conſider how many thouſand
ſeveral words have been careleſly
and without ſtudy compoſed out of
24 Letters; withal, how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
lines there are to be drawn in
the Fabrick of one Man; ſhall eaſily
find that this variety is neceſſary:
And it will be very hard that they
ſhall ſo concur, as to make one por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
like another. Let a Painter
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100491:77"/>
careleſly limb out a million of Faces,
and you ſhall find them all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
yea let him have his Copy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, yet after all his art there
will remain a ſenſible diſtinction; for
the pattern or example of every
thing is the perfecteſt in that kind,
whereof we ſtill come ſhort, though
we tranſcend or go beyond it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
herein it is wide, and agrees
not in all points unto the Copy. Nor
doth the ſimilitude of Creatures
diſparage the variety of Nature, nor
any way confound the Works of
God. For even in things alike there
is diverſity; and thoſe that do ſeem
to accord, do manifeſtly diſagree.
And thus is man like God; for in the
ſame things that we reſemble him,
we are utterly different from him.
There was never any thing ſo like
another, as in all points to concur;
there will ever ſome reſerved diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
ſlip in, to prevent the identity,
without which, two ſeveral things
would not be alike, but the ſame,
which is impoſſible.</p>

Charity: I hold not ſo narrow a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100491:78"/>
of this virtue, as to conceive
that to give Alms, is onely to be
Charitable, or think a piece of Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
can comprehend the Total of
Charity. Divinity hath wiſely divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the acts thereof into many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and hath taught us in this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
way, many paths unto goodneſs:
as many ways as we may do good, ſo
many ways we may be charitable:
there are infirmities, not onely of
Body, but of Soul and Fortunes,
which do require the merciful hand
of our abilities. I cannot contemn
a man for ignorance, but behold him
with as much pity as I do <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
It is no greater Charity to cloath his
body, than apparel the nakedneſs
of his Soul. It is an honourable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to ſee the reaſons of other men
wear our Liveries, and their borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
underſtandings do homage to the
bounty of ours: It is the cheapeſt
way of beneficence, and like the
natural charity of the Sun, illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
another without obſcuring it
ſelf. To be reſerved and caitiff in
this part of goodneſs, is the ſordideſt
piece of covetouſneſs, and more
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100491:78"/>
contemptible than pecuniary Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.
To this (as calling my ſelf a
Scholar) I am obliged by the duty
of my condition: I make not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my head a grave, but a treaſure
of knowledge; I intend no Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly,
but a community in learning;
I ſtudy not for my own ſake only,
but for theirs that ſtudy not for
themſelves. I envy no man that
knows more than my ſelf, but pity
them that know leſs. I inſtruct no
man as an exerciſe of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or with an intent rather to
nouriſh and keep it alive in mine
own head, then beget and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
it in his; and in the midſt of all
my endeavours, there is but one
thought that dejects me, that my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
parts muſt periſh with my
ſelf, nor can be Legacied among my
honoured Friends. I cannot fall out,
or contemn a man for an errour, or
conceive why a difference in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould divide an affection: For
Controverſies, Diſputes, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
both in Philoſophy, and
in Divinity, if they meet with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and peaceable natures, do not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100491:79"/>
infringe the Laws of Charity: in all
diſputes, ſo much as there is of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſo much there is of nothing to
the purpoſe; for then Reaſon, like
a bad Hound, ſpends upon a falſe
Scent, and forſakes the queſtion firſt
ſtarted. And this is one reaſon why
Controverſies are never determined;
for though they be amply propoſed,
they are ſcarce at all handled, they
do ſo ſwell with unneceſſary Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and the Parentheſis on the

* St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that calls the <hi>Cretians</hi>
lyars, doth it but indirectly, and
upon quotation of their own Poet.]
‖ It is as bloody a thought in one
way, as <hi>Nero</hi>'s was in another. For
by a word we wound a thouſand,]
and at one blow aſſaſſine the honour
of a Nation. It is as compleat a piece
of madneſs to miſcal and rave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the times; or think to recal
men to reaſon, by a fit of paſſion:
<hi>Democritus,</hi> that thought to laugh
the times into goodneſs, ſeems to me
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100491:80"/>
as deeply Hypochondriack, as <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi>
that bewailed them. It moves
not my ſpleen to behold the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in their proper humours, that
is, in their fits of folly and madneſs,
as well underſtanding that wiſdom is
not prophan'd unto the World, and
'tis the priviledge of a few to be Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.
They that endeavour to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Vice, deſtroy alſo Virtue, for
contraries, though they deſtroy one
another; are yet in life of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thus Virtue (aboliſh vice) is
an Idea: again, the community of
ſin doth not diſparage goodneſs; for
when Vice gains upon the major
part, Virtue, in whom it remains,
becomes more excellent; and being
loſt in ſome, multiplies its goodneſs
in others, which remain untouched,
and perſiſt intire in the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation.
I can therefore behold
Vice without a Satyr, content only
with an admonition, or inſtructive
reprehenſion,, for Noble Natures,
and ſuch as are capable of goodneſs,
are railed into vice, that might as
eaſily be admoniſhed into virtue;
and we ſhould be all ſo far the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100491:81"/>
of goodneſs, as to protract her
from the power of Vice, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the cauſe of injured truth. No
man can juſtly cenſure or condemn
another, becauſe indeed no man
truly knows another. This I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in my ſelf; for I am in the dark
to all the world, and my neareſt
friends behold me but in a cloud:
thoſe that know me but ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
think leſs of me than I do of
my ſelf; thoſe of my neer acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
think more: God, who truly
knows me, knows that I am nothing;
for he only beholds me, and all the
world; who looks not on us through
a derived ray, or a trajection of a
ſenſible ſpecies, but beholds the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
without the helps of accidents,
and the forms of things, as we their
operations. Further, no man can
judge another, becauſe no man
knows himſelf; for we cenſure others
but as they diſagree from that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
which we fancy laudible in
our ſelves, and commend others but
for that wherein they ſeem to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate
and conſent with us. So that in
concluſion, all is but that we all
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100491:81"/>
condem, Self-love. 'Tis the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
complaint of theſe times, and
perhaps of thoſe paſt, that charity
grows cold; which I perceive moſt
verified in thoſe which moſt do
manifeſt the fires and flames of zeal;
for it is a virtue that beſt agrees
with coldeſt natures, and ſuch as
are complexioned for humility.
But how ſhall we expect Charity
towards others, when we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
to our ſelves? Charity
begins at home, is the voice of the
World; yet is every man his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
enemy, and as it were, his own
Executioner. <hi>Non occides,</hi> is the
Commandment of God, yet ſcarce
obſerved by any man; for I perceive
every man is his own <hi>Atropos,</hi> and
lends a hand to cut the thred of his
own days. <hi>Cain</hi> was not therefore
the firſt Murtherer, but <hi>Adam,</hi> who
brought in death; whereof he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the practice and example in his
own ſon <hi>Abel,</hi> and ſaw that verified
in the experience of another, which
faith could not perſwade him in the
Theory of himſelf.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> There is, I think, no man that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100491:82"/>
his own miſeries leſs than
my ſelf, and no man that ſo neerly
apprehends anothers. I could loſe an
arm without a tear, and with few
groans, methinks, be quartered into
pieces; yet can I weep moſt ſeriouſly
at a Play, and receive with true
paſſion, the counterfeit grief of
thoſe known and profeſſed Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures.
It is a barbarous part of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity
to add unto any afflicted
parties miſery, or indeavour to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
in any man, a paſſion, whoſe
ſingle nature is already above his
patience: this was the greateſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Job;</hi> and thoſe oblique ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations
of his Friends, a deeper
injury than the down-right blows
of the Devil. It is not the tears of
our own eyes only, but of our friends
alſo, that do exhauſt the current
of our ſorrows; which falling into
many ſtreams, runs more peaceably,
and is contented with a narrower
channel. It is an act within the
power of charity, to tranſlate a
paſſion out of one breſt into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to divide a ſorrow almoſt
out of it ſelf; for an affliction, like a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100491:82"/>
dimenſion, may be ſo divided, as if
not indiviſible, at leaſt to become
inſenſible. Now with my friend I
deſire not to ſhare or participate,
but to engroſs his ſorrows, that by
making them mine own, I may more
eaſily diſcuſs them; for in mine own
reaſon, and within my ſelf, I can
command that, which I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
without my ſelf, and within
the circle of another. I have often
thought thoſe noble pairs and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of friendſhip not ſo truly Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of what had been, as fictions of
what ſhould be; but I now perceive
nothing in them but poſſibilities,
nor any thing in the Heroick exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias, Achilles</hi>
and <hi>Patroclus,</hi> which methinks upon
ſome grounds I could not perform
within the narrow compaſs of my
ſelf. That a man ſhould lay down
his life for his Friend, ſeems ſtrange
to vulgar affections, and ſuch as
confine themſelves within that
Worldly principle, Charity begins at
home. For my own part, I could
never remember the relations that
I held unto my ſelf, nor the reſpect
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100491:83"/>
that I owe unto my own nature, in
the cauſe of God, my Country, and
my Friends. Next to theſe three I do
embrace my ſelf: I confeſs I do not
obſerve that order that the Schools
ordain our affections, to love our
Parents, Wives, Children, and then
our Friends; for excepting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
of Religior, I do not find
in my ſelf ſuch a neceſſary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble
Sympathy to all thoſe of
my blood. I hope I do not break
the fifth Commandment, if I conceive
I may love my friend before the
neareſt of my blood, even thoſe to
whom I owe the principles of life:
I never yet caſt a true affection on
a woman, but I have loved my
friend as I do virtue, my ſoul, my
God. From hence me thinks I do
conceive how God loves man, what
happineſs there is in the love of God.
Omitting all other, there are three
moſt myſtical unions; two natures
in one perſon; three perſons in one
nature; one ſoul in two bodies. For
though indeed they be really divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
yet are they ſo united, as they
ſeem but one, and make rather a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100491:83"/>
duality than two diſtinct ſouls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> There are wonders in true affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it is a body of <hi>Enigma</hi> 's, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
and riddles; wherein two ſo
become one, as they both become
two: I love my friend before my
ſelf, and yet methinks I do not love
him enough: ſome few months
hence, my multiplied affection will
make me believe I have not loved
him at all: when I am from him, I
am dead till I be with him; when I
am with him, I am not ſatisfied, but
would ſtill be nearer him. United
ſouls are not ſatisfied with imbraces,
but deſire to be truly each other;
which being impoſſible, their deſires
are infinite, and proceed without a
poſſibility of ſatisfaction. Another
miſery there is in affection, that
whom we truly love like our own,
we forget their looks, nor can our
memory retain the Idea of their
faces; and it is no wonder: for they
are our ſelves, and our affection
makes their looks our own. This
noble affection falls not on vulgar
and common conſtitutions, but on
ſuch as are mark'd for virtue: he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100491:84"/>
that can love his friend with this
noble ardour, will in a competent
degree effect all. Now if we can bring
our affections to look beyond the
body, and caſt an eye upon the ſoul,
we have found out the true object,
not only of friendſhip, but Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and the greateſt happineſs
that we can bequeath the ſoul, is that
wherein we all do place our laſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
Salvation; which though it
be not in our power to beſtow, it is
in our charity, and pious invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to deſire, if not procure and
further. I cannot contentedly frame
a prayer for my ſelf in particular,
without a catalogue for my friends;
nor requeſt a happineſs wherein my
ſociable diſpoſition doth not deſire
the fellowſhip of my neighbour. I
never hear the Toll of a paſſing
Bell, though in my mirth, without
my prayers and beſt wiſhes for the
departing ſpirit: I cannot go to cure
the body of my patient, but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
my profeſſion, and call unto
God for his ſoul: I cannot ſee one
ſay his prayers, but in ſtead of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
him, I fall into a ſupplication
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100491:84"/>
for him, who perhaps is no more to
me than a common nature: and if
God hath vouchſafed an ear to my
ſupplications, there are ſurely many
happy that never ſaw me, and enjoy
the bleſſing of mine unknown de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.
To pray for Enemies, that
is, for their ſalvation, is no harſh
precept, but the practice of our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ordinary devotions.* I cannot
believe the ſtory of the Italian;]
our bad wiſhes and uncharitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
proceed no further than this
life; it is the Devil, and the unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

miſery in the World to come.</p>

was a principle, which to my former
years, and impatient affections,
ſeemed to contain enough of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
but my more ſetled years, and
Chriſtian conſtitution, have fallen
upon ſeverer reſolutions. I can hold
there is no ſuch thing as injury; that
if there be, there is no ſuch injury as
revenge, and no ſuch revenge as the
contempt of an injury; that to hate
another, is to malign himſelf; that
the trueſt way to love another, is to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100491:85"/>
deſpiſe our ſelves. I were unjuſt
unto mine own Conſcience, if I
ſhould ſay I am at variance with
any thing like my ſelf. I find there
are many pieces in this one fabrick
of man; this frame is raiſed upon a
maſs of Antipathies: I am one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
but as the World; wherein
notwithſtanding there are a ſwarm
of diſtinct eſſences, and in them
another World of contrarieties; we
carry private and domeſtick ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
within, publick and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile
adverſaries without. The Devil,
that did but buffet St. <hi>Paul,</hi> plays
methinks at ſharp with me. Let me
be nothing, if within the compaſs of
my ſelf, I do not find the battail
of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> Paſſion againſt Reaſon,
Reaſon againſt Faith, Faith againſt
the Devil, and my Conſcience againſt
all. There is another man within
me, that's angry with me, rebukes,
commands, and daſtards me. I have
no Conſcience of Marble, to reſiſt
the hammer of more heavy offences;
nor yet too ſoft and waxen, as to
take the impreſſion of each ſingle
peccadillo or ſcape of infirmity: I
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100491:85"/>
am of a ſtrange belief, that it is
as eaſie to be forgiven ſome ſins, as
to commit ſome others. Eor my
Original ſin, I hold it to be waſhed
away in my Baptiſm; for my actual
tranſgreſſions, I compute and reckon
with God, but from my laſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Sacrament, or general abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore am not terrified
with the ſins or madneſs of my youth.
I thank the goodneſs of God,* I
have no ſins that want a name,] I
am not ſingular in offences; my
tranſgreſſions are Epidemical, and
from the common breath of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
For there are certain tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of body, which matcht with an
humorous depravity of mind, do
hatch and produce vitioſities, whoſe
newneſs and monſtroſity of nature
admits no name; ‖ this was the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of that Lecher that carnal'd with
a Statua,]* and conſtitution of <hi>Nero</hi>
in his Spintrian recreations.] For the
Heavens are not only fruitful in
new and unheard-of ſtars, the Earth
in plants and animals; but mens
minds alſo in villany and vices:
now the dulneſs of my reaſon, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100491:86"/>
the vulgarity of my diſpoſition, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prompted my invention, nor
ſollicited my affection unto any of
thoſe; yet even thoſe common and
quotidian infirmities that ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
attend me, and do ſeem to be
my very nature, have ſo dejected
me, ſo broken the eſtimation that I
ſhould have otherwiſe of my ſelf,
that I repute my ſelf the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteſt
piece of mortality. Divines
preſcribe a fit of ſorrow to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;

of a contrary nature, which
neither ſeem to ſute with this action,
nor my proper conſtitution. It is no
breach of charity to our ſelves, to be
at variance with our Vices; nor to

enemy to the ground of charity, our

from that ſweet Sex, but natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amorous of all that is beautiful;
I can look a whole day with delight
upon a handſome Picture, though it
be but of an Horſe. It is my temper,

harmony; and ſure there is muſick
even in the beauty, and the ſilent
note which <hi>Cupid</hi> ſtrikes, far ſweeter
than the ſound of an inſtrument. For
there is a muſick where ever there
is a harmony, order or proportion;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100491:89"/>
and thus far we may maintain the
muſick of the Sphears: for thoſe well-ordered
motions, and regular paces,
though they give no ſound unto the
ear, yet to the underſtanding they
ſtrike a note moſt full of harmony.
Whoſoever is harmonically compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
delights in harmony; which
makes me much diſtruſt the ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

againſt all Church-Muſick. For my

but my particular Genius, I do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it: for even that vulgar and
Tavern-Muſick, which makes one
man merry, another mad, ſtrikes in
me a deep fit of devotion, and a
profound contemplation of the firſt
Compoſer. There is ſomething in it
of Divinity more than the ear diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
it is an Hieroglyphical and
ſhadowed leſſon of the whole World,
and creatures of God; ſuch a melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to the ear, as the whole World
well underſtood, would afford the

fit of that harmony, which intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectually
ſounds in the ears of God.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100491:89"/>

ſometimes the malady of my pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100491:90"/>
be not a diſeaſe unto me; I deſire
rather to cure his infirmities than my
own neceſſities: where I do him no
good, methinks it is ſcarce honeſt
gain; though I confeſs 'tis but the
worthy ſalary of our well-intended
endeavours. I am not only aſhamed,
but heartily ſorry, that beſides
death, there are diſeaſes incurable;
yet not for my own ſake, or that they
be beyond my Art, but for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
cauſe and ſake of humanity,
whoſe common cauſe I apprehend as
mine own. And to ſpeak more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
thoſe three Noble Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which all civil Common-wealths
do honour, are raiſed upon the fall
of <hi>Adam,</hi> and are not exempt from
their infirmities; there are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſeaſes incurable in Phyſick, but
caſes indiſſolvable in Laws, Vices
incorrigible in Divinity: if gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils may err, I do not ſee
why particular Courts ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible;
their perfecteſt rules are
raiſed upon the erroneous reaſons
of Man; and, the Laws of one, do
but condemn the rules of another;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100491:90"/>
as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> oft-times the opinions
of his Predeceſſours, becauſe,, though
agreeable to reaſon, yet were not
conſonant to his own rules, and
Logick of his proper Principles.
Again, to ſpeak nothing of the Sin
againſt the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe cure
not onely, but whoſe nature is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known;
I can cure the Gout or Stone
in ſome, ſooner than Divinity Pride
or Avarice in others. I can cure Vices
by Phyſick, when they remain incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
by Divinity; and ſhall obey
my Pills, when they contemn their
precepts. I boaſt nothing, but plainly
ſay, we all labour againſt our own
cure; for death is the cure of all
diſeaſes. There is no Catholicon or
univerſal remedy I know but this,
which though nauſeous to queaſie
ſtomacks, yet to prepared appetites
is Nectar, and a pleaſant potion of
immortality.</p>

are able to preſerve themſelves from

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100491:91"/>
is the corruption that I fear within

it be the Apothegme of a wiſe

not only becauſe he is with himſelf,

to ſpeak more narrowly, there is no

without the concourſe of God, and
the ſociety of that hand which doth

thirty years, which to relate, were
not a Hiſtory, but a piece of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and would ſound to common
ears like a Fable; for the World, I
count it not an Inn, but an Hoſpital;
and a place, not to live, but to dye in.
The world that I regard is my ſelf;
it is the Microcoſm of my own frame
that I caſt mine eye on; for the
other, I uſe it but like my Globe,
and turn it round ſometimes for my
recreation. Men that look upon my
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100491:92"/>
outſide, peruſing only my condition
and Fortunes, do err in my Altitude,
for I am above <hi>Atlas</hi> his ſhoulders.
The earth is a point not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Heavens above us, but
of that heavenly and celeſtial part
within us: that maſs of Fleſh that
circumſcribes me, limits not my
mind: that ſurface that tells the
Heavens it hath an end, cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
me I have any: I take my
circle to be above three hundred and
ſixty; though the number of the
Ark do meaſure my body, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
not my mind: whilſt I
ſtudy to find how I am a Microcoſm
or little World, I find my ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than the great. There is
ſurely a piece of Divinity in us,
ſomething that was before the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and owes no homage unto the
Sun. Nature tells me I am the Image
of God, as well as Scripture: he that
underſtands not thus much, hath not
his introduction or firſt leſſon, and is
yet to begin the Alphabet of man.
Let me not injure the felicity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
if I ſay I am as happy as any;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100491:93"/>
                     <hi>Ruat coelum, Fiat voluntas tua,</hi> ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
all; ſo that whatſoever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
it is but what our daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
deſire. In brief, I am content,
and what ſhould providence add
more? Surely this is it we call Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
and this do I enjoy; with this
I am happy in a dream, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to enjoy a happineſs in a fancy,
as others in a more apparent truth
and realty. There is ſurely a neerer
apprehenſion of any thing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
us in our dreams, than in our
waked ſenſes; without this I were
unhappy: for my awaked judgment
diſcontents me, ever whiſpering
unto me, that I am from my friend;
but my friendly dreams in night re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
me, and make me think I am
within his arms. I thank God for
my happy dreams, as I do for my
good reſt, for there is a ſatisfaction
unto reaſonable deſires, and ſuch as
can be content with a fit of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And ſurely it is not a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
conceit to think we are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep
in this World, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of this, life are as meer dreams
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100491:93"/>
to thoſe of the next, as the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms
of the night, to the conceits of
the day. There is an equal deluſion in
both, and the one doth but ſeem to
be the embleme or picture of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
we are ſomewhat more than
our ſelves in our ſleeps, and the
ſlumber of the body ſeems to be
but the waking of the ſoul. It is
the ligation of ſenſe, but the liberty
of reaſon, and our waking concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
do not match the Fancies of
our ſleeps. At my Nativity, my
Aſcendant was the watery ſign of
<hi>Scorpius;</hi> I was born in the Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
hour of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and I think I
have a piece of that Leaden Planet
in me. I am no way facetious,
nor diſpoſed for the mirth and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liardize
of company; yet in one
dream I can compoſe a whole Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
behold the action, apprehend
the juſts, and laugh my ſelf awake at
the conceits thereof: were my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
as faithful as my reaſon is then
fruitful, I would never ſtudy but
in my dreams; and this time alſo
would I chuſe for my devotions: but
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100491:94"/>
* our groſſer memories have then ſo
little hold of our abſtracted under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
that they forget the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,]
and can only relate to our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked
ſouls, a confuſed and broken
tale of that that hath paſſed. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
who hath written a ſingular
Tract of Sleep, hath not methinks
throughly defined it; nor yet <hi>Galen,</hi>
though he ſeem to have corrected it:
for thoſe <hi>Noctambuloes / </hi> and night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walkers,
though in their ſleep, do
yet injoy the action of their ſenſes:
we muſt therefore ſay that there is
ſomething in us that is not in the
juriſdiction of <hi>Morpheus;</hi> and that
thoſe abſtracted and ecſtatick ſouls
do walk about in their own corps,
as ſpirits with the bodies they
aſſume; wherein they ſeem to
hear, and feel, though indeed the
Organs are deſtitute of ſenſe, and
their natures of thoſe faculties that
ſhould inform them. Thus it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that men ſometimes upon
the hour of their departure, do
ſpeak and reaſon above themſelves,
For then the ſoul beginning to be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100491:94"/>
freed from the ligaments of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
begins to reaſon like her ſelf, and

for this I think charity, to love God
for himſelf, and our neighbour for

God, or as it were a divided piece
of him, that retains a reflex or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of himſelf. Nor is it ſtrange
that we ſhould place affection on that
which is inviſible; all that we truly
love is thus; what we adore under
affection of our ſenſes, deſerves not
the honour of ſo pure a title. Thus
we adore virtue, though to the eyes
of ſenſe ſhe be inviſible: Thus that

Of the ſame fate this preſent

Exception by ſome hath been taken to
it in reſpect of its Inſcription, which,
ſay they, ſeems to imply that <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
have a Religion by themſelves,
which is more than Theologie doth
warrant: but it is their Inference,
and not the Title, that is to blame;
<pb facs="tcp:100491:101"/>

Age hath produced none that has had

it has been received and foſtered by

place, that I made this Recuil meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for mine own entertainment, and not
with any invention to evulge it; Truth
<pb facs="tcp:100491:103"/>
is my witneſs, the publication proceeds
meerly from the importunity of the
Book-ſeller (my ſpecial friend) who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acquainted with what I had done,
and about to ſet out another Edition of
the Book, would not be denied theſe
Notes to attex to it; 'tis he (not I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)

                     <hi>Now the accidental occaſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi>
&amp;c.] This is graphically deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by <hi>Thuanus</hi> in his Hiſtory: but
becauſe his words are too large for
this purpoſe, I ſhall give it you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more briefly, according to
the relation of the Author of the
Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
The occaſion was the neceſſity of
Pope <hi>Leo</hi> Tenth, who by his profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
had ſo exhauſted the Treaſure of
the <hi>Church,</hi> that he was conſtrained
to have recourſe to the publiſhing of
Indulgences to raiſe monies: ſome
of which he had deſtined to his own
Treaſury, and other part to his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes,
and particularly to his Siſter
he gave all the money that ſhould
be raiſed in <hi>Saxony;</hi> and ſhe, that
ſhe might make the beſt profit of
the donation, commits it to one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remboldus,</hi>
a Biſhop, to appoint Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers
for theſe Indulgences. Now
the cuſtome was, that whenſoever
theſe Indulgences were ſent into
<hi>Saxony,</hi> they were to be divulged
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100491:107"/>
by the Fryars <hi>Eremites</hi> (of which
Order <hi>Luther</hi> then was) but <hi>Arem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldus</hi>
his agents thinking with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that the Fryars <hi>Eremites</hi> were
ſo well acquainted with the trade,
that if the buſineſs ſhould be left to
them, they ſhould neither be able to
give ſo good an account of their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation,
nor yet get ſo much them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by it as they might do in
caſe the buſineſs were committed to
another Order; they thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it to (and the buſineſs is
undertaken by) the <hi>Dominican</hi> Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,
who performed it ſo ill, that
the ſcandal ariſing both from thence,
and from the ill lives of thoſe that
ſet them on work, ſtirred up <hi>Luther</hi>
to write againſt the abuſes of theſe
Indulgences; which was all he did
at firſt; but then, not long after,
being provoked by ſome Sermons
and ſmall Diſcourſes that had been
publiſhed againſt what he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
he rips up the <hi>buſineſs</hi> from the
beginning, and publiſhes xcv <hi>Theſes</hi>
againſt it at <hi>Wittenberg.</hi> Againſt
theſe, <hi>Tekel</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> writes; then
<hi>Luther</hi> adds an explication to his
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100491:107"/>
                     <hi>Eckius</hi> and <hi>Prierius</hi> Dominicans,
thereupon take the controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him: and now <hi>Luther</hi> begins
to be hot; and becauſe his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
could not found the matter of
Indulgences upon other foundations
then the <hi>Pope</hi>'s power and infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that begets a diſputation betwixt
them concerning the Pope's power,
which <hi>Luther</hi> inſiſts upon as inferiour
to that of a <hi>general Council;</hi> and ſo
by degrees he came on to oppoſe
the Popiſh Doctrine of <hi>Remiſſion of
Sins, Penances,</hi> and <hi>Purgatory;</hi> and
by reaſon of Cardinal <hi>Cajetans</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
management of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
he had with him, it came to
paſs that he rejected the whole body
of Popiſh Doctrine. So that by this
we may ſee what was the accidental
occaſion, wherein the ſlender means
whereby, and the abject condition
of the perſon by whom, the work of
Reformation of Religion was ſet on
foot.</p>

rather promiſcuouſly retain all, than
abridge any; and obſtinately be what
they are, than what they have been, as
to ſtand in a diameter and at ſwords
points with them: we have reformed
from them, not againſt them,</hi> &amp;c.]
Theſe words by Mr. <hi>Merryweather</hi>
are thus rendred, <hi>ſc. Nee tamen in

the Latine Annotator ſits down very
well ſatisfied with it, and hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
ſome Notes upon it; but
under the favour both of him and
the Tranſlator, this Tranſlation is ſo
far different from the ſenſe of the
Author, that it hath no ſenſe in it;
or if there be any conſtruction of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100491:108"/>
ſenſe in it, it is quite beſides the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
meaning; which will appear
if we conſider the context, by that
we ſhall find that the Author in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an account of his Religion,
tells us firſt, that he is a Chriſtian,
and farther, that he is of the reform'd
Religion; but yet he ſaith, in this
place, he is not ſo rigid a Proteſtant,
nor at defiance with Papiſts ſo far,
but that in many things he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with them, (the particulars he
afterwards mentions in this Section)
for, ſaith he, we have reform'd from
them, not againſt them; that is, as
the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> againſt
the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> diſcourſeth well, We
have made no new Religion nor
Schiſm from the old; but in calling
for the old, and deſiring that which
was novel and crept in might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
it, we have reform'd from
thoſe upſtart novel Doctrines, but
againſt none of the old: and other
ſenſe the place cannot bear; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how the <hi>Latine Annotator</hi> can
apply it as though in this place the
Author intended to note the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100491:109"/>
baptiſt</hi> I ſee not, unleſs it were in
reſpect of the expreſſion, <hi>Vecordem
pertinacium hominum gregem,</hi> which
truly is a deſcription well befitting
them, though not intended to them
in this place: howſoever, I ſee not any
ground from hence to conclude the
Author to be any whit inclining to
the <hi>Bulk</hi> of Popery (but have great
reaſon from many paſſages in this
Book to believe the contrary,) as he
that prefix'd a Preface to the Pariſian
Edition of this Book hath unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
done.</p>
                  <p>But for the miſtake of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator,
it is very obvious from whence
that aroſe. I doubt not but it was
from the miſtake of the ſenſe of the
Engliſh Phraſe, <hi>Shaken hands,</hi> which
he hath rendred by theſe words,
<hi>Memet adjungo,</hi> wherein he hath too
much play'd the Scholar, and ſhew'd
himſelf to be more skilful in forraign

eſt Angelus hominis, eſt corpus
<hi>Dei,</hi> as <hi>Entelechia;</hi> Lux eſt umbra
<hi>Dei,</hi> as <hi>actus perſpoicui.</hi>] Great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of opinion there hath been
amongſt the Ancient Philoſophers
touching the definition of the Soul.
<hi>Thales,</hi> his was, that it is <hi>a Nature
without Repoſe. Aſclepiades,</hi> that it
is an <hi>Exercitation of Senſe. Heſiod,</hi>
that it is <hi>a thing compoſed of Earth
and Water; Parmenides</hi> holds, <hi>of
Earth and Fire; Galen</hi> that it is <hi>Heat;
Hippocrates,</hi> that it is <hi>a ſpirit dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
through the body.</hi> Some others
have held it to be <hi>Light; Plato</hi> ſaith,
'tis a <hi>Subſtance moving it ſelf;</hi> and
after him cometh <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (whom
the Author here reproveth) and
goeth a degree farther, and ſaith it
is <hi>Entelechia,</hi> that is, that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
makes the body to move.
But this definition is as rigid as any
of the other; for this tells us not
what the <hi>eſſence, origine</hi> or <hi>nature</hi> of
the <hi>ſoul</hi> is, hut only marks an <hi>effect</hi>
of it, and therefore ſignifieth no
more than if he had ſaid (as the
Author's Phraſe is) that it is <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100491:114"/>
hominis,</hi> or an <hi>Intelligence</hi> that
moveth man, as he ſuppoſed thoſe
other to do the Heavens.</p>
                  <p>Now to come to the definition of
Light, in which the Author is alſo
unſatisfied with the School of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
he ſaith, It ſatisfieth him no
more to tell him that <hi>Lux eſt actus
perſpicui,</hi> than if you ſhould tell
him that it is <hi>umbra Dei.</hi> The ground
of this definition given by the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks,</hi>
is taken from a paſſage
in <hi>Ariſtot. de anima, l. 2. cap.</hi> 7.
where <hi>Ariſttotle</hi> ſaith, That the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the thing ſeen doth move
that which is <hi>perſpicuum actu (i.e.
illuſtratam naturam quae ſit in aere
aliove corpore tranſparente</hi>) and that
that, in regard of its continuation to
the eye, moveth the eye, and by its
help the internal <hi>ſenſorium;</hi> and
that ſo viſion is perform'd. Now as
it is true that the Sectators of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
are too blame, by faſtening up
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him by occaſion of this paſſage,
that he meant that thoſe things that
made this impreſs upon the Organs
are meer accidents, and have nothing
of ſubſtance; which is more than
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100491:114"/>
ever he meant, and cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without violence to Reaſon
and his own Principles; ſo for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
himſelf, no man is beholden
to him for any Science acquir'd by
this definition; for what is any man
the near for his telling him that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
(admitting it to be a body, as
indeed it is, and in that place he
doth not deny) doth move <hi>actu per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuum,</hi>
when as the perſpicuity is in
relation to the eye; and he doth not
ſay how it comes to be perſpicuous,
which is the thing enquired after,
but gives it that denomination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the eye hath perform'd its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
ſo that if he had ſaid it had been
<hi>umbra Dei,</hi> it would have been as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
as what he hath ſaid. He
that would be ſatisfied how Viſion is
perform'd, let him ſee Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in

betwixt Eternity</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> there
have been great diſputes amongſt
Philoſophers; ſome affirming it to
be no more than <hi>duration perpetual
conſiſting of parts;</hi> and others (to
which opinion, it appears by what
follows in this Section, the Author
adheres) affirmed (to uſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
phraſe) that it hath no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Tenſes, but is according to
<hi>Boetius (lib. 5. conſol. proſ.</hi> 6.) his
definition, <hi>interminabilis vitae tota
ſimul &amp; perfecta poſſeſſio.</hi> For me,
<hi>Non noſtrum eſt tantas componere lites.</hi>
I ſhall only obſerve what each of
them hath to ſay againſt the other.
Say thoſe of the firſt opinion againſt
thoſe that follow <hi>Boetius</hi> his defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That definition was taken by
<hi>Boetius</hi> out of <hi>Plato's Timaeus,</hi> and is
otherwiſe applyed, though hot by
<hi>Boetius,</hi> yet by thoſe that follow
him, than ever <hi>Plato</hi> intended it; for
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100491:116"/>
he did not take it in the Abſtract,
but in the Concrete, for an <hi>eternal
thing,</hi> a <hi>Divine ſubstance</hi> by which
he meant <hi>God,</hi> or his <hi>Anima mundi:</hi>
and this he did, to the intent to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
this truth, That no mutation
can befal the Divine Majeſty, as it
doth to things ſubject to generation
and corruption; and that <hi>Plato</hi> there
intended not to define or deſcribe
any <hi>ſpecies</hi> of duration: and they
ſay that it is impoſſible to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
any ſuch <hi>ſpecies</hi> of duration
that is (according to the Author's
expreſſion) but one <hi>permanent point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that which thoſe that follow
<hi>Boetius,</hi> urge againſt the other defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, they ſay it doth not at all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<hi>Eternity</hi> from the nature of
<hi>Time;</hi> for they ſay if it be compoſed
of many <hi>Nunc's,</hi> or many inſtants, by
the addition of one more, it is ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed;
and by that means <hi>Infinity</hi>
or <hi>Eternity</hi> is not included, nor ought
more than <hi>Time.</hi> For this, ſee Mr.

that God and the World both, were

upon the eighth Book of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s
<hi>Phyſicks</hi> treating of the matter
of Creation, when they had firſt
ſaid that it was poſſible to know it,
and that actually it was known, (for
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> knew it) yet for all this they
afterwards affirm, That conſidering
onely the light of Nature, there is
nothing can be brought to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
Creation: and yet farther,
when they had defined Creation to
be the production of a thing <hi>ex ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hhilo,</hi>
and had proved that the world
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100491:117"/>
was ſo created in time, and refuſed
the arguments of the Philoſophers
to the contrary, they added this,
That the World might be created <hi>ab
aeterno:</hi> for having propos'd this
queſtion [<hi>Num aliquid à Deo ex Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitate
procreari potuit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>] they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the affirmative, and aſſert, That
not onely incorporeal ſubſtances, as
Angels; or permanent, as the celeſtial
Bodies; or corruptible, as Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
might be produced and made <hi>ab ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno,</hi>

is neither repugnant to God the
Creator, the things created, nor to
the nature of Creation; for proof
whereof, they bring inſtances of the
<hi>Sun,</hi> which if it had been eternal,
had illuminated eternally, (and the
virtue of God is not leſs than the
virtue of the Sun.) Another inſtance
they bring of the <hi>divine Word,</hi> which
was produc'd <hi>ab aeterno:</hi> in which
diſcourſe, and in the inſtances
brought to maintain it, it is hard to
ſay whether the madneſs or impiety
be greater; and certainly if Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

Mr. <hi>Nat. Carpenter,</hi> who in his <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophia

ſuch cauſe as that which they call
the <hi>Final cauſe:</hi> he argueth thus;
Every cauſe hath an influence upon
its effect, but ſo has not the End,
therefore it is not a Cauſe. The <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi>
Propoſition (he ſaith) is evident,
becauſe the influence of a cauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its effect, is either the cauſality
it ſelf, or ſomething that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
conjoyned to it: and the <hi>minor</hi>
as plain; for either the End hath an
influence upon the effect imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
or mediately, by ſtirring up
the Efficient to operate; not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100491:119"/>
becauſe ſo it ſhould enter
either the <hi>conſtitution,</hi> or <hi>production,</hi>
or <hi>conſervation</hi> of the things; but
the conſtitution it cannot enter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the conſtitution is onely of
<hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form;</hi> nor the: Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for ſo it ſhould concur to the
production, either as it is <hi>ſimply the
end,</hi> or as an <hi>exciter of the Efficient;</hi>
but not ſimply as the end, becauſe
the end <hi>as end</hi> doth not go before,
but followeth the thing produced,
and therefore doth not concur to its
production: if they ſay it doth
ſo far concur, as it is deſired of
the agent or efficient cauſe, it ſhould
not ſo have an immediate influence
upon the effect, but ſhould onely firſt
move the efficient. Laſtly, ſaith he,
it doth not enter the conſervation
of a thing, becauſe a thing is often
conſerved, when it is fruſtrate of its
due end, as when its converted to a
new uſe and end. Divers other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
he hath to prove there is no

Notes upon this place ſaith, There is
no contradiction in this, becauſe he
ſaith it was but putting all things
that had motion into the ſame ſtate
they were in at that moment, unto
which time was to be reduced back,
and from thence letting it travel on
again by the ſame motions, (<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which God could do. But under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
the contradiction remains, if
this were done that he mentions;
for Time depends not at all upon
motion, but has a being altogether
independent of it, and therefore the
ſame revolution would not bring
back the ſame time, for that was
efflux'd before; as in the time of
<hi>Joſhua,</hi> when the Sun ſtood ſtill, we
cannot but conceive though there
were no motion of the Sun, but that
there was an efflux of Time, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
how could the Text have it,
<hi>That there was not any day, before

for the length of it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

The reaſoning of Sir <hi>Kenelme</hi> is
founded upon the opinion of <hi>Ariſtot.</hi>
who will needs have it, that Time,
cannot be without mutation; he
gives this for a reaſon, becauſe when
we have ſlept, and cannot perceive
any mutation to have been, we do
therefore uſe to connect the time of
our ſleeping and of our awaking
together, and make but one of it: to
which it may be anſwered, although
ſome mutation be neceſſary, that we
may mark the flux of time, it doth
not therefore follow that the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is neceſſary to the flux it ſelf.</p>

                     <hi>I wonder how the curioſity of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
heads could paſs that great and
indiſputable miracle, the ceſſation of
Oracles.</hi> [There are three opinions
touching the manner how the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
of theſe Oracles were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd:
Some ſay by vapour,
ſome by the intelligences, or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the Heavens, and others
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100491:137"/>
ſay by the aſſiſtance of the Devils.
Now the indiſputable miracle the
Author ſpeaks of, is, that they
ceas'd upon the coming of Chriſt;
and it is generally ſo believed; and
the Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> delivered to
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> mentioned by the Author
in this Section, is brought to prove
it, which is this:
<q>
                        <l>Me puer Hebraeus divos Deus ipſe gubernans</l>
                        <l>Cedere ſede jubet, triſtem<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> redire ſub orcum,</l>
                        <l>Aris ergo dehinc tacitus diſcedito noſtris.</l>
                     </q>
But yet it is ſo far from being true
that their ceſſation was miraculous,
that the truth is, there never were
any predictions given by thoſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
at all.</p>
                  <p>That their ceſſation was not upon
the coming of Chriſt, we have lucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
teſtimony out of <hi>Tully,</hi> in his 2.
<hi>lib. de Divinat.</hi> which he writ many
years before Chriſt was born; who
tells us that they were ſilent (and
indeed he never thought they were
otherwiſe) long before that time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that they were come into
contempt: <hi>Cur iſto modo jam oracula
Delphis non eduntur, non modò no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100491:137"/>
aetate, ſed jamdiù jam ut nihil
poſſit eſſe contemptius.</hi> So that for
that of <hi>Delphos,</hi> which was the moſt
famous of them all, we ſee we have
no reaſon to impute the ceſſation of
it to Chriſt; Why therefore ſhould
we do ſo for any of the reſt?</p>
                  <p>2. For their predictions, let us
conſider the three ſeveral ways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, whereby they are
ſuppoſed to operate; and from
thence ſee whether it be probable
that any ſuch Oracles ever were.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Opinion is, that it was
by exhalation or vapour drawn up
from the earth; and gives this for a
reaſon of their being, that they were
for a time nouriſhed by thoſe exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
and when thoſe ceaſed, and
were exhauſted, the Oracles famiſh'd
and died for want of their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd
ſuſtenance: this is the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetcht
reaſon given by <hi>Plutarch</hi> for
their defect; but 'twas not deviſed
by him, but long before, as appears,
in that <hi>Tully</hi> ſcoffs at it, <hi>lib. de divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.
De vino aut ſalſamento putes lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>quae evaneſcunt vetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</hi>
This ſeem'd abſurd to others,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100491:138"/>
who do therefore ſay this was not to
be attributed to any power of the
Earth, but to the power of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
or <hi>Intelligences Coeleſtial;</hi> to
certain aſpects, whereof, they ſay, the
Statua's of thoſe Oracles were ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted,
that they might divine and
foretel future events. But yet to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
this way ſeemeth as abſurd as
the others; for, ſay they, admitting
that there were an efficacy in the
Heavens, more than in the Earth;
yet how can it be that men ſhould
come by the skill to fit the Statua's
to the Aſpects or influences of the
Heavens? or if at any time they
had ſuch skill, why ſhould not
the ſame continue the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
men are more skilled in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Heavens, of later than
in the former time? Again, they do
not ſee how it ſhould be that the
cauſe ſhould be of leſs excellency
than the effect; for if a man (ſay
they) can by his induſtry make ſuch
Oracles, why can he not produce
the ſame effect in another man?
for if you affirm that the Heavens
influence is requiſite, they will tell
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100491:138"/>
you that Influence may happen as
well to a man, as to a Statue of
wood or ſtone. Therefore the third
ſort being unſatisfied, which either
of the former ways conclude, that
this was perform'd by the Devil;
but for that it will appear as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Reaſon and Philoſophy, as
either of the former; for Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
teacheth that things ſingular, or
individual, are to be known only
by ſenſe, or by ſuch an Intellect, as
doth know by its Eſſence; and
Theology teacheth that God only
knoweth the heart, and that the
Devil doth not know by ſenſe, nor
by eſſence; and ſince 'tis admitted
by all, that moſt of the anſwers that
were pretended to be given by
thoſe Oracles, were <hi>de rebus ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laribus,</hi>
or <hi>individuis;</hi> it is evident
that theſe predictions were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by Devils. How then? why
thoſe predictions which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Heathen took to come from
Heaven, and ſome Chriſtians (not
leſs ignorant) from the Devil, was
nothing but the jugling and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
of the Prieſts, who from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100491:139"/>
the Statua's gave the anſwers;
which Princes connived at, that
they might upon occaſion ſerve their
turns upon the ignorance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and the learned men, for fear
of their Princes, durſt not ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it. <hi>Lucian</hi> hath noted it, and

Felix,</hi> in <hi>Octav. Authoritatem quaſi

proceſs of time, the people grew
leſs credulous of their Prieſts, and
ſo the Oracles became to be ſilent:
<hi>Cum jam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Apollo verſus

to have been ſuch; which indeed,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100491:139"/>
is much eaſier to imagine than that
it was perform'd by any of the three
ways before mentioned: St. <hi>Aug.</hi>

ſort of Witches they were that the

upon the principles of Nature, none

But for the opinion that there are
Witches which co-operate with the
Devil, there are Divines of great
note, and far from any ſuſpition
of being irreligious, that do oppoſe
it. Certainly there is no ground to
maintain their being from the ſtory
of Oracles, as may be ſeen from what
hath been ſaid on the precedent

                     <hi>Nor have they power to be ſo much

the firſt day,</hi> Fiat lux, <hi>to the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Angels.</hi>] This great Father is
<hi>S. Chryſoſt. Homil. in Geneſ.</hi> but
yet 'tis his opinion, as alſo of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi>
and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that there is
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100491:141"/>
expreſs mention of the creation of
Angels, ſo that they need not reſt
upon this place, which they admit
to be ſomewhat obſcure. The place
which they take to be expreſs, is
that of the 130 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
begins to ſpeak of the Majeſty
of God, in this manner: <hi>Confeſſionem
ſive majeſtatem &amp; decorem induiſti,
amictus lumine ſicut veſtimento:</hi>
Next he ſpeaks of the Heavens, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Thou haſt ſtretched them out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us like a Tent.</hi> Then he ſpeaks
of the Angels, <hi>Qui facis Angelos
tuos ſpiritus.</hi> Now if it ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that this expreſſion is onely
of the time preſent, and without
relation to the Creation: Anſwer is
given by Divines, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
have but three Tenſes in their
Verbs, the Preterperfect, Preſent,
and Future Tenſe; and have not the
uſe of the Preterimperfect, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpulperfect,
as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
have; whence it ariſeth, that
the Preſent Tenſe with the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
may, as the ſentence will bear it,
be tranſlated by the Preterimperfect,
as alſo by the Preterperfect and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpluperfect
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100491:141"/>
Tenſe; and this (they
ſay) is practiſed in this very paſſage,
where the Phraſe, as it is in Hebrew,
may be rendred as well <hi>qui faciebas,</hi>
as <hi>qui facis Angelos,</hi> &amp;c. Vid. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronym.

which place I have peruſed, and
find the expreſſion there uſed by
St. <hi>Aug.</hi> is but hypothetical; for
theſe are his words: <hi>Cum enim dixit

Epicurus <hi>was of this opinion,
and St.</hi> Aug. in Enchirid. ad Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</p>
                  <p>Moſes <hi>decided that Queſtion, and
all is ſalved with the new term of
Creation.</hi>] That is it which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
could not underſtand; he had learned
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100491:142"/>
that <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he found thoſe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
that the World had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
did maintain that it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
and he could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
any generation, but out of
matter prae-exiſtent <hi>in infinitum,</hi>
therefore he took their opinion to
be abſurd, and upon that ground
principally, concluded the World
to be eternal: whereas, if he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
that there may be ſuch a
thing as Creation, he had not done
it, for that ſolves his <hi>proceſſus in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum.</hi>
Take from <hi>Plato,</hi> that the
World had a beginning, and from
<hi>Ariſtot.</hi> that it was not generated,
and you have the (true) Chriſtian
opinion.</p>

it ſhould be excus'd in a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
I know not. To look upon him
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100491:148"/>

wrote his Epiſtle <hi>De Conſolat.</hi> to
<hi>Polybius, Claudius</hi> his creature (as
honeſt a man as <hi>Pallas</hi> or <hi>Narciſſus</hi>)
and therein he extols him and the

he did groſly prevaricate, and loſt
much of his reputation, by ſeeking a

part it is ſo. In regard of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
expreſſion of forgetting the

very pertinent to this place, I ſhall
ſet down a relation given by an
Engliſh Gentleman, of two dreams
that he had, wherein he did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the ſtory, but (what is more
ſtrange) found his dreams verified.
This it is.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I lived at <hi>Prague,</hi> and
one night had ſit up very late drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a feaſt, early in the morning
the Sun beams glancing on my face,
as I lay in my bed, I dreamed that a
ſhadow paſſing by told me that my
Father was dead; at which awaking
all in a ſweat, and affected with
this dream, I roſe and wrote the
day and hour, and all circumſtances
thereof in a Paper book, which book
with many other things I put into
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100491:158"/>
a Barrel, and ſent it from <hi>Prague</hi> to
<hi>Stode,</hi> thence to be conveyed into
<hi>England.</hi> And now being at <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renburgh,</hi>
a Merchant of a noble
Family well acquainted with me
and my friends, arrived there, who
told me my Father dyed ſome
two months ago. I liſt not to write
any lyes, but that which I write, is
as true as ſtrange. When I returned
into <hi>England</hi> ſome four years after,
I would not open the Barrel I ſent
from <hi>Prague,</hi> nor look into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
book in which I had written this
dream, till I had called my Siſters
and ſome friends to be witneſſes,
where my ſelf and they were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
to ſee my written dream
anſwer the very day of my Father's
death.</p>
                  <p>I may lawfully ſwear that which
my Kinſman hath heard witneſſed
by my brother <hi>Henry</hi> whilſt he lived,
that in my youth at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> I
had the like dream of my Mother's
death, where my brother <hi>Henry</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with me, early in the morning
I dreamed that my Mother paſſed
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100491:159"/>
by with a ſad countenance, and told
me that ſhe could not come to my
Commencement: I being within five
months to proceed Maſter of Arts,
and ſhe having promiſed at that
time to come to <hi>Cambridge.</hi> And
when I related this dream to my
brother, both of us awaking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a ſweat, he proteſted to me
that he had dreamed the very ſame:
and when we had not the leaſt
knowledge of our Mothers ſickneſs,
neither in our youthful affections
were any whit affected with the
ſtrangeneſs of this dream, yet the
next Carrier brought us word of our
Mothers death. Mr. <hi>Fiennes Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
in his Itinerary. I am not over
credulous of ſuch relations, but me
thinks the circumſtance of publiſhing
it at ſuch a time, when there were
thoſe living that might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
it, if it had been falſe,
is a great argument of the truth of
it.</p>

Lordſhips of the nineteenth

pleaſed to oblige me, not
onely by extream gallant Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of favour and kindneſs, but
likewiſe by taking ſo far into
your care the expending of my
time, during the tediouſneſs of my
reſtraint, as to recommend to my
reading a <hi>Book,</hi> that had received
the honour and ſafeguard of your
approbation; for both which I moſt
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100491:162"/>
humbly thank your Lordſhip. And
ſince I cannot in the way of grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
expreſs unto your Lordſhip
as I would, thoſe hearty ſentiments
I have of your goodneſs to me; I
will at the laſt endeavour, in the
way of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obſervance,</hi> to let
you ſee how the little Needle of my
Soul is throughly touched at the
great Loadſtone of yours, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
ſuddenly and ſtrongly, which
way ſoever you becken it. In this
occaſion, the Magnetick motion
was impatient to have the <hi>Book</hi> in
my hands, that your Lordſhip gave ſo
advantagious a Character of; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I ſent preſently (as late as it
was) to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard for this
Favourite of yours, <hi>Religio Medici:</hi>
which after a while found me in a
condition fit to receive a Bleſſing by
a viſit from any of ſuch Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces,
as you look upon with graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
eyes; for I was newly gotten
into my bed. This good-natured
creature I could eaſily perſwade to

me, as long as I had any edge to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain

my ſelf with the delights I ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

truely (my Lord) I cloſed not my
eyes, 'till I had enricht my ſelf with,

onely a general commendation of

Whoſe firſt ſtep is ingenuity and
a well-natur'd evenneſs of <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
ſhall be ſure of applauſe and
fair hopes in all men for the reſt of
his <hi>Journey.</hi> And indeed (my Lord)
me thinketh this Gentleman ſetteth
out excellently poiſed with that
happy temper; and ſheweth a great
deal of <hi>Judicious Piety</hi> in making a
right uſe of the blind zeal that <hi>Bigots</hi>
loſe themſelves in. Yet I cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
my Doubts throughly, how he
maketh good his profeſſing to follow
the great Wheel of the Church in
matters of <hi>Divinity:</hi> which ſurely
is the ſolid <hi>Baſis</hi> of true Religion:
for to do ſo, without jarring againſt
the Conduct of the firſt Mover by
Eccentrical and Irregular Motions,
obligeth one to yield a very dutiful
obedience to the determinations of
it, without arrogating to ones ſelf a
controling Ability in liking or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
the Eaith, Doctrine, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of that <hi>Church</hi> which one
looketh upon as their North-ſtar:
<hi>Whereas,</hi> if I miſtake not, this
Author approveth the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> not abſolutely, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:100491:163"/>
with other Reformed
Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My next Reflection is, concerning
what he hath ſprinkled (moſt witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
in ſeveral places concerning the
Nature and Immortality of a humane
Soul, and the Condition and State it
is in, after the diſſolution of the
Body. And here give me leave to
obſerve what our Country-man</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Bacon <hi>did long ago;</hi> That thoſe
Students, who buſie themſelves much
with ſuch Notions, as reſide wholly to
the fantaſie, do hardly ever become I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneous
for abſtracted Metaphyſical
Speculations; the one having bulkie
Foundation of Matter, or of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
of it, to ſettle upon, (at the
leaſt, with one foot:) The other fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
continually, even to a leſſening
pitch in the ſubtil Air. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
it hath been generally noted,
That the exacteſt Mathematicians, who
converſe altogether with Lines, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
and other Differences of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
have ſeldom proved eminent in
Metaphyſicks, or Speculative Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Nor again, the Profeſſors of theſe
Sciences in the other Arts. Much leſs
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100491:164"/>
can it be expected that an excellent
Phyſician, whoſe fancy is alwayes
fraught with the material Drugs that
he preſcribeth his Apothecary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
his Medicines of, and whoſe
hands are inured to the cutting up, and
eyes to the inſpection of Anatomized
Bodies, ſhould eaſily, and with ſucceſs,
flie his thoughts at ſo towring a
<hi>Game,</hi> as a pure Intellect, a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and unbodied Soul. <hi>Surely this
acute</hi> Author<hi>'s ſharp wit, had he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
applied his Studies that way,
would have been able to ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with leſs labour, and others with
more plenitude, than it hath been
the Lot of ſo dull a brain as mine,
concerning the</hi> Immortality of the
Soul. <hi>And yet, I aſſure you (my</hi>
Lord) <hi>the little</hi> Philoſophy <hi>that is
allowed me for my ſhare, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrateth
this Propoſition to me,
as well as Faith delivereth it;</hi> which
<hi>our</hi> Phyſician <hi>will not admit in
his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make good this Aſſertion here
were very unreaſonable; ſince that to
do it exactly (and without exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
it were not demonſtration) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:100491:164"/>
a total Survey of the whole
Science of <hi>Bodies,</hi> and of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
that we are converſant
with, of a rational Creature; which
I having done with all the ſuccinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
I have been able to explicate
ſo knotty a ſubject with, hath taken
me up in the firſt draught neer two
hundred ſheets of Paper. I ſhall
therefore take leave of this Point,
with only this Note, That I take
the <hi>Immortality of the Soul</hi> (under
his favour) to be of that nature,
that to them onely that are not
verſed in the ways of proving
it by Reaſon, it is an Article of
Faith; to others, it is an evident
Concluſion of demonſtrative Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>And with a like ſhort Note, I ſhall
obſerve, how if he had traced the
Nature of the <hi>Soul</hi> from its firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
he could not have ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it ſhould ſleep in the Grave, 'till
the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Body. Nor
would he have permitted his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionative
Nature to imagin it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to God's mercy (as the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſts</hi>
did) to change its condition
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:100491:165"/>
in thoſe that are damned, from
pain to happineſs. For where God
ſhould have done that, he muſt have
made that anguiſhed Soul another
creature than what it was (as to
make fire ceaſe from being hot, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
to have it become another
thing than the <hi>Element</hi> of fire; ſince
that to be in ſuch a condition, as
maketh us underſtand damned ſouls
miſerable, is a neceſſary effect of
the temper it is in, when it goeth
out of the <hi>Body,</hi> and muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
(out of its Nature) remain in,
unvariably for all Eternity; <hi>Though,</hi>
for the Conceptions of the vulgar
part of Mankind, (who are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ſuch abſtruſe Nations) it
be ſtyled (and truely too) the
ſentence and puniſhment of a ſevere
<hi>Judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am extreemly pleaſed with him,
when he ſaith, There are not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities
enough in <hi>Religion</hi> for
an Active Faith: And no whit leſs,
when in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> he will not be
ſatisfied with ſuch naked terms, as in
<hi>Schools</hi> uſe to be obtruded, upon
eaſie minds, when the Maſter's fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:100491:165"/>
are not ſtrong enough to untie
the Knots propoſed unto them. I
confeſs, when I enquire what Light
(to uſe our Author's Example) is, I
ſhould be as well contented with his
ſilence, as with his telling me it is
<hi>Actus perſpicui;</hi> unleſs he explicate
clearly to me, what thoſe words
mean, which I find very few go
about to do. Such meat they ſwallow
whole, and eject it as entire. But
were ſuch things Scientifically and
Methodically declared, they would
be of extream Satisfaction and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
And that work taketh up
the greateſt part of my formerly-mentioned
Treatiſe. For I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſhew by a continued Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
and not by Leaps, all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Nature; and unto them to
fit intelligibly the terms uſed by her
beſt Secretaries; whereby all wilde
fantaſtick Qualities and Moods (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
for refuges of Ignorance)
are baniſhed from Commerce.</p>
                  <p>In the next place (my <hi>Lord</hi>) I
ſhall ſuſpect that our Author hath
not pennetrated into the bottom of
thoſe Conceptions that deep Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100491:166"/>
have taught us of <hi>Eternity;</hi> Me
thinketh he taketh it for an infinite
Extenſion of time, and a never end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Revolution of continual ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
which is no more like <hi>Eternity,</hi>
than a groſs Body is like a pure
<hi>Spirit.</hi> Nay, ſuch an Infinity of
Revolutions, is demonſtrable to be
a Contradiction, and impoſſible. In
the ſtate of <hi>Eternity</hi> there is no
Succeſſion, no Change, no Variety.
<hi>Souls</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> in that condition,
do not ſo much as change a thought.
All things, notions and actions, that
ever were, are, or ſhall be in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
are actually preſent to ſuch an
Intellect. And this (my <hi>Lord</hi>) I
aver, not as deriving it from
<hi>Theology,</hi> and having recourſe to
beatifick Viſion, to make good my
Tenet, (for ſo, onely glorified
creatures ſhould enjoy ſuch immenſe
knowledge) but out of the principles
of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and from
thence ſhall demonstrate it to belong
to the loweſt <hi>Soul</hi> of the ignoranteſt
wretch whilſt he lived in this world,
ſince damned in <hi>Hell.</hi> A bold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
you will ſay. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:100491:166"/>
engage my ſelf to it. Upon
this occaſion occurreth alſo a great
deal to be ſaid of the nature of
<hi>Predeſtination</hi> (which by the ſhort
touches our Author giveth of it, I
doubt he quite miſtakes) and how it
is an unalterable <hi>Series</hi> and <hi>Chain
of Cauſes,</hi> producing <hi>infallible</hi> (and
in reſpect of them, neceſſary) Effects.
But that is too large a <hi>Theam</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
here; too vaſt an <hi>Ocean</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
in the ſcant Map of a Letter.
And therefore I will refer that to a
fitter opportunity, fearing I have
already too much treſpaſſed upon
your Lordſhip's patience; but that
indeed, I hope, you have not had
enough to read thus far.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure, my <hi>Lord,</hi> that you
(who never forgot any thing which
deſerved a room in your memory)
do remember how we are told, that
<hi>Abyſſus abyſſum invocat;</hi> ſo here
our Author, from the Abyſs of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,</hi>
falleth into that of the
<hi>Trinity of Perſons,</hi> conſiſtent with
the Indiviſibility of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And out of that (if I be not
exceedingly deceived) into a third
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:100491:167"/>
of miſtaking, when he goeth about
to illuſtrate this admirable Myſtery
by a wild diſcourſe of a <hi>Trinity</hi> in
our <hi>Souls.</hi> The dint of Wit is not
forcible enough to diſſect ſuch tough
Matter; wherein all the obſcure
glimmering we gain of that inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Light, cometh to us cloathed
in the dark Weeds of Negations, and
therefore little can we hope to meet
with any poſitive Examples to paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
it withal.</p>
                  <p>I doubt, he alſo miſtaketh, and
impoſeth upon the ſeveral <hi>Schools,</hi>
when he intimateth, that they gain-ſay
this viſible worlds being but a
Picture or Shadow of the Inviſible
and Intellectual: which manner
of <hi>Philoſophizing</hi> he attributeth to
<hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus,</hi> but is every
where to be met with in <hi>Plato:</hi> and
is raiſed ſince to a greater height in
the Chriſtian Schools.</p>
                  <p>But I am ſure he learned in no
good School, nor ſucked from any
good <hi>Philoſophy</hi> to give an actual
Subſiſtence and Being to firſt Matter
without a Form. He that will allow
that a <hi>Real Exiſtence</hi> in Nature is
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:100491:167"/>
as ſuperficially tincted in <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks,</hi>
as another would be in
<hi>Mathematicks,</hi> that ſhould allow
the like to a Point, a Line, or a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
in Figures; Theſe, in their
ſtrict Notions, are but Negations of
further Extenſion, or but exact
Terminations of that Quantity,
which falleth under the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Underſtanding in the
preſent purpoſe, no real Entities in
themſelves: ſo likewiſe, the Notions
of Matter, Form, Act, Power, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,
and the like, that are with
Truth, conſidered by the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and have there each of
them a diſtinct Entity, are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
no where by themſelves in
Nature. They are terms which we
muſt uſe in the Negotiations of our
thoughts, if we will diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
and conclude knowingly.
But then again, we muſt be very
wary of attributing to things in
their own Natures ſuch Entities
as we create in our Underſtandings,
when we make Pictures of them
there; for there every different
conſideration, ariſing out of the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:100491:168"/>
different impreſſion which the ſame
thing maketh upon us, hath a diſtinct
Being by it ſelf. Whereas in the
thing there is but one ſingle <hi>Vnity,</hi>
that ſheweth (as it were in a Glaſs,
at ſeveral poſitions) thoſe various
faces in our underſtanding. In a
word, all theſe words are but arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
terms, not real things. And the
not right underſtanding of them;
is the dangerouſeſt Rock that <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
ſuffer ſhipwrack againſt.</p>
                  <p>I go on with our <hi>Phyſician</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations.
Upon every occaſion
he ſheweth ſtrong parts, and a
vigorous brain. His wiſhes and aims,
and what he pointeth at, ſpeak him
owner of a noble and a generous
heart. He hath reaſon to wiſh that
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had been as accurate in
examining the Cauſes, Nature and
Affections of the great Univerſe he
buſied himſelf about, as his Patriarch
<hi>Galen</hi> hath been in the like conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
upon this little <hi>World,</hi> Man's
Body in that admirable Work of his
<hi>De Vſu Partium.</hi> But no great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
thing was ever born and
perfected at once. It may ſatisfie
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:100491:168"/>
us, if one in our age, buildeth that
magnificent Structure upon the
others foundations; and eſpecially,
if where he findeth any of them
unſound, he eradicateth thoſe, and
ſixeth new unqueſtionable ones in
their room: But ſo, as they ſtill,
in groſs, keep a proportion, and bear
a <hi>Harmony</hi> with the other great
Work. This hath now, (even now)
our learned Countryman done; The
knowing Mr. <hi>White,</hi> (whoſe name, I
believe your Lordſhip hath met with
al, in his excellent Book, <hi>De Mundo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
newly printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> where he now
reſideth, and is admired by the World
of Letter'd men there, as the <hi>Prodigie</hi>
of theſe latter times. Indeed his three
<hi>Dialogues</hi> upon that Subject, (if I
am able to judge any thing) are full
of the profoundeſt Learning I ever
yet met withal. And I believe, who
hath well read &amp; digeſted them, will
perſwade himſelf, there is no truth
ſo abſtruſe, nor hitherto conceived
out of our reach, but mans wit may
raiſe Engines to ſcale and conquer. I
aſſure my ſelf, when our Author
hath ſtudied him throughly, he will
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:100491:169"/>
not lament ſo loud for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated
and defective <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as
in <hi>Boccaline Caeſar Caporali</hi> doth
for the loſs of <hi>Livies</hi> ſhip-wracked
<hi>Decads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Logick</hi> which he quarrelleth
at, for calling a <hi>Toad</hi> or <hi>Serpent</hi>
ugly, will in the end agree with
his; for no body ever took them
to be ſo, in reſpect of the <hi>Vniverſe,</hi>
(in which regard he deſendeth
their Regularity and Symmetry)
but onely as they have relation to
us.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot ſo eaſily agree with
him, where he affirmeth, that <hi>Devils</hi>
or other <hi>Spirits</hi> in the Intellectual
World, have no exact <hi>Ephemerides,</hi>
wherein they may read before-hand
the Stories of fortuite Accidents. For
I believe, that all Cauſes are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
chained to their Effects, as
if a perfect knowing Nature get
hold but of one link, it will drive the
entire <hi>Series,</hi> or Pedigree of the
whole to its utmoſt end; (as I think
I have proved in my fore-named
Treatiſe) ſo that in truth there is
no Fortuitneſs or Contingency of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:100491:169"/>
things, in reſpect of themſelves, but
onely in reſpect of us, that are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of their certain and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Now a little <hi>Series</hi> or Chain and
Complex of all outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
(whoſe higheſt link, <hi>Poets</hi>
ſay prettily is faſten'd to <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s
Chair, and the loweſt is riveted to
every Individual on Earth) ſteered
and levelled by <hi>God Almighty;</hi> at the
firſt ſetting out of the firſt Mover; I
conceive; to be that <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
and <hi>Mercy,</hi> which (to uſe our
Author's own Example) giveth a
thriving <hi>Genius</hi> to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi>
and the like: And not any ſecret, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
myſtical Bleſſing, that falleth
not under the ſearch or cognizance
of a prudent indagation.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs approve our Authors
Aequanimity, and I may as juſtly
ſay his Magnanimity, in being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
ſo cheerfully (as he ſaith) to
ſhake hands with the fading <hi>Goods</hi>
of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and be deprived of the
joys of her moſt precious bleſſings;
ſo that he may in recompence poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
in ample meaſure the true ones
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:100491:170"/>
of the mind; like <hi>Epictetus,</hi> that
Maſter of moral Wiſdom and Piety,
who taxeth them of high injuſtice,
that repine at Gods Diſtribution of
his Bleſſings, when he putteth not
into their ſhare of goods, ſuch things
as they uſe no Induſtry or Means
to purchaſe. For why ſhould that
man, who above all things eſteemeth
his own freedom, and who to enjoy
that, ſequeſtreth himſelf from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with the vulgar of mankind;
take it ill of his <hi>Stars,</hi> if ſuch Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Honours, and Applauſes meet
not him, as are painfully gained, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
long and tedious Services of
<hi>Princes,</hi> and brittle Dependances of
humorous Favourites, and ſupple
Compliances with all ſorts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
As for what he ſaith of <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie;</hi>
I do not conceive, that wiſe
men reject it ſo much for being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to <hi>Divinity</hi> (which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileth
well enough) as for having
no ſolid Rules or ground in Nature.
To rely too far upon that vain Art,
I judge to be rather folly than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
unleſs in our cenſure we look
to the firſt <hi>Origine</hi> of it; which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100491:170"/>
of the Idolatry of thoſe <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
that worſhipping the <hi>Stars</hi>
and heavenly Bodies for <hi>Deities,</hi> did
in a ſuperſtitious Devotion, attribute
unto them the Cauſality of all Effects
beneath them. And for ought I
know, the belief of ſolid <hi>Orbs</hi> in the
Heavens, and their regularly-irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Motions, ſprung from the ſame
root. And a like Inanity, I ſhould
ſuſpect in <hi>Chiromancy,</hi> as well as
<hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> (eſpecially, in particular
contingent Effects) however our
<hi>Author,</hi> and no leſs a man than <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
ſeem to attribute ſomewhat
more to that conjectural Art of
<hi>Lines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould much doubt (though our
Author ſheweth himſelf of another
mind) that <hi>Bernardinus Ochin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi>
grew at the laſt to be a meer <hi>Atheiſt:</hi>
When after having been firſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutor
and <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the <hi>Capucine-Order</hi>
(ſo violent was his Zeal then,
as no former religious Inſtitution,<note place="margin">This Story I have but upon rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet of a very good hand.</note>
though never ſo rigorous, was ſtrict
enough for him) he from thence fell
to be firſt an <hi>Heretick,</hi> then a <hi>Jew,</hi> and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100491:171"/>
after a while became a <hi>Turk;</hi> and at
the laſt wrote a furious Invective
againſt thoſe, whom he called the
three <hi>Grand Impoſtors</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi>
among whom he ranked our Saviour
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doubt he miſtakes in his <hi>Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi>
or the Printer in the name,
when he maketh <hi>Ptolomy</hi> condemn
the <hi>Alchoran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He needeth not be ſo ſcrupulous,
as he ſeemeth to be in averring
down-rightly, That God cannot do
contradictory things, (though perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
it is not amiſs to ſweeten the
manner of the expreſſion, and the
ſound of the words) for who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
the nature of contradiction,
will find <hi>Non-Entity</hi> in one of the
terms, which of <hi>God</hi> were impiety
not to deny peremptorily. For he
being in his proper Nature <hi>Self-Entity,</hi>
all <hi>Being</hi> muſt immediately
flow from him, and all <hi>Not-Being</hi> be
totally excluded from that Efflux.
Now for the recalling of <hi>Time</hi> paſt,
which the <hi>Angels</hi> poſed <hi>Eſdras</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100491:171"/>
there is no contradiction in that,
as is evident to them that know the
eſſence of Time. For it is but putting
again, all things that had motion,
into the ſame ſtate they were in, at
that moment unto which time was
to be reduced back, and from thence
letting it travel on again by the ſame
motion, and upon the ſame wheels
it rouled upon before. And therefore
God could do this admirable Work,
though neither <hi>Eſdras,</hi> nor all the
power of Creatures together could
do it: And conſequently it cannot in
this Queſtion be ſaid, that he poſed
Mortality with what himſelf was
not able to perform.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge ingenuouſly, our
<hi>Phyſician</hi>'s experience hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of my <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there are Witches. Yet I am
ſure, I have no temptation to doubt
of the <hi>Deity;</hi> nor have any unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in believing there are <hi>Spirits.</hi>
I do not ſee ſuch a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
between them, as that the
ſuppoſition of the one muſt needs
infer the other. Neither do I deny
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:100491:172"/>
there are Witches. I only reſerve
my Aſſent, till I meet with ſtronger
motives to carry it. And I confeſs I
doubt as much of the efficacy of
thoſe Magical Rules, he ſpeaketh of,
as alſo of the finding out of Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
by the courteous <hi>Revelation of
Spirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doubt his Diſcourſe of an
<hi>Vniverſal Spirit,</hi> is but a wild
Fancy: and that in the marſhalling
of it, he miſtaketh the <hi>Hermetical
Philoſophers.</hi> And ſurely, it is a weak
argument, from a common nature,
that ſubſiſteth only in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
(out of which it hath no
being at all) to infer by parity, an
actual Subſiſtence, or the like, in
reality of nature (of which kind of
miſcarriage in mens diſcourſings, I
have ſpoken before.) And upon this
occaſion, I do not ſee how ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he falleth of a ſudden from
natural Speculations, to a Moral
Contemplation of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in us. In which alſo I would
enquire (eſpecially upon his ſudden
Poetical rapture) whether the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:100491:172"/>
of the <hi>Judgement</hi> be not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed
by the airineſs of the Fancy.
Aſſuredly one cannot err in taking
this <hi>Author</hi> for a very fine ingenious
<hi>Gentleman:</hi> But for how deep a
<hi>Scholar,</hi> I leave unto them to judge,
that are abler than I am.</p>
                  <p>If he had applied himſelf with
earneſt ſtudy, and upon right
grounds, to ſearch out the Nature of
pure Intellects; I doubt not but his
great Parts would have argued more
efficaciouſly, than he doth againſt
thoſe, that between <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi>
put only <hi>Porphyrie'</hi> difference of
<hi>Mortality</hi> and <hi>Immortality.</hi> And he
would have dived further into the
tenour of their Intellectual Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
in which there is no Succeſſion,
nor ratiocinative Diſcourſe; for in
the very firſt inſtant of their Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they actually knew all that they
were capable of knowing, and they
are acquainted even with all free
thoughts, paſt, preſent, and to come;
for they ſee them in their cauſes, and
they ſee them all together at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;
as I have in my fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100491:173"/>
Treatiſe proved at <hi>large:</hi> And I
think I have already touched thus
much once before in this <hi>Letter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am tempted here to ſay a great
deal concerning <hi>Light,</hi> by his taking
it to be a bare Quality. For in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks,</hi>
no Speculation is more uſeful,
or reacheth further. But to ſet down
ſuch <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> of it, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
and from whence I evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
collect the Nature of it, were too
large a <hi>Theam</hi> for this place: When
your Lordſhip pleaſeth, I ſhall ſhew
you another more orderly Diſcourſe
upon that Subject; wherein I have
ſufficiently proved it to be a ſolid
Subſtance and Body.</p>
                  <p>In his proceeding to collect an
Intellectual World, and in his
diſcourſing upon the place and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Angels;</hi> as alſo in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the activity of glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Eyes, which ſhall be in the ſtate
of reſt, whereas motion is required
to ſeeing; and in his ſubtil Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon two Bodies, placed in the
Vacuity, beyond the utmoſt all-encloſing
Superficie of <hi>Heaven</hi> (which
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100491:173"/>
implieth a Contradiction in Nature)
methinks I hear <hi>Apelles</hi> cry out, <hi>Ne
ſutor ultra Crepidam:</hi> or rather, it
putteth me in mind of one of the
Titles in <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Library, (which
he expreſſeth himſelf converſant in)
namely, <hi>Quaeſtio ſubtiliſſima, utrum
Chimaera in vacuo bombinans poſſit
comedere Secundas intentiones;</hi> with
which ſhort Note I will leave theſe
Conſiderations; in which (if time,
and other circumſtances allowed
it) matter would ſpring up of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When our Author ſhall have
read Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> Dialogue of the
<hi>World,</hi> he will no longer be of
the Opinion, That the Unity of
the World is a concluſion of Faith:
For it is there demonſtrated by
<hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the thread of the Diſcourſe
inviteth me to ſay a great deal of
the Production or Creation of <hi>Mans
Soul.</hi> But it is too tedious, and too
knotty a piece for a <hi>Letter.</hi> Now
it ſhall ſuffice to note, that it is not
<hi>Ex traduce,</hi> and yet hath a ſtrange
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:100491:174"/>
kind of near dependance of the
Body, which is, as it were, Gods
instrument to create it by. This,
thus ſaid, or rather tumbled out,
may ſeem harſh. But had your
Lordſhip leiſure to peruſe what I
have written at full upon this Point,
I doubt not but it would appear
plauſible enough to you.</p>
                  <p>I cannot agree with him, when
he ſeemeth to impute Inconvenience
to <hi>long Life,</hi> and that length of time
doth rather impair, than improve us:
For ſurely, if we will follow the
courſe of Nature, and of Reaſon,
it is a mighty great bleſſing; were it
but in this regard, that it giveth time
leave to vent and boyl away the
unquietneſſes and turbulencies that
follow our paſſions, and to wean our
ſelves gently from carnal affections,
and at the laſt to drop with eaſe and
willingneſs, like ripe fruit from the
<hi>Tree;</hi> as I remember <hi>Plotinus</hi> finely
diſcourſeth in one of his <hi>Eneads.</hi> For
when before the Seaſon, it is pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
off with violent hands, or ſhaken
down by rude and boyſterous winds,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100491:174"/>
it carrieth along with it an indigeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
raw taſt of the Wood, and hath an
unpleaſant aigerneſs it its juyce,
that maketh it unfit for uſe, till long
time hath mellowed it: And perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
it may be ſo backward, as
in ſtead of ripening, it may grow
rotten in the very <hi>Center.</hi> In like
manner, <hi>Souls</hi> that go out of their
<hi>Bodies</hi> with affection to thoſe Objects
they leave behind them, (which
uſually is as long as they can reliſh
them) do retain ſtill even in their
Separation, a by as, and a languiſhing
towards them: which is the <hi>Reaſon</hi>
why ſuch terrene Souls appear
ofteneſt in <hi>Coemeteries</hi> and <hi>Charnel-houſes,</hi>
and not that moral one,
which our Author giveth. For Life,
which is union with the body, being
that which carnal ſouls have ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
affection to, and that they are
loatheſt to be ſeparated from; their
unquiet <hi>Spirit,</hi> which can never
(naturally) loſe the impreſſions it
had wrought in it at the time of its
driving out, lingereth perpetually
after that dear Conſort of his. The
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100491:175"/>
impoſſibility cannot cure them of
their impotent deſires; they would
fain be alive again;
<q>—Iterumque ad tarda revierti
Corpora. Quae lucis miſeris tam
dira cupido.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to this cauſe peradventure
may be reduced the ſtrange effect,
which is frequently ſeen in <hi>England,</hi>
When at the approach of the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,</hi>
the ſlain body ſuddenly
bleedeth afreſh. For certainly,
the Souls of them that are treacherouſly
murdered by ſurprize, uſe to leave
their bodies with extream unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and with vehement indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt them, that force them to
ſo unprovided and abhorred a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
That Soul then, to wreak its
evil talent againſt the hated Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
and to draw a juſt and deſired
revenge upon his head, would do all
it can to manifeſt the author of the
fact. To ſpeak, it cannot, for in
it ſelf it wanteth <hi>Organs</hi> of voice;
and thoſe it is parted from, are now
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:100491:175"/>
grown too heavy, and are too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed
for it to give motion unto.
Yet ſome change it deſireth to make
in the body, which it hath ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inclinations to, and therefore is
the apteſt for it to work upon: It
muſt then endeavour to cauſe a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the ſubtileſt and moſt fluid
parts (and conſequently, the moſt
moveable ones) of it. This can be
nothing but the Blood, which then
being violently moved, muſt needs
guſh out at thoſe places where it
findeth iſſues.</p>
                  <p>Our Author cannot believe, that
the World will periſh upon the ruines
of its own principles. But Mr. <hi>White</hi>
hath demonſtrated the end of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
natural Reaſon. And though
the preciſe time for that general
Deſtruction be inſcrutable; yet he
learnedly ſheweth an ingenious Rule,
whereby to meaſure in ſome ſort
the duration of it, without being
branded (as our Author threatneth)
with convincible and <hi>Statute</hi>-mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or with impiety. And whereas
he will have the work of this laſt
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:100491:176"/>
great Day (the Summer up of all
paſt days) to imply annihilation and
thereupon intereſſeth God only in
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt beg leave to contradict
him, namely in this Point; and to
affirm, that the letting looſe then of
the activeſt Element, to deſtroy this
face of the World, will but beget a
change in it; and that no annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can proceed from God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:
For his Eſſence being (as
I ſaid before) ſelf-exiſtence, it is
more impoſſible that Not-being
ſhould flow from him, than that
cold ſhould flow immediately from
fire, or darkneſs from the actual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of light.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs acknowledge, that
where he ballanceth Life and Death
againſt one another, and conſidereth
that the latter is to be a Kind of
nothing for a moment, to become
a pure <hi>Spirit</hi> within one inſtant,
and what followeth of this ſtrong
thought, is extream handſomely
ſaid, and argueth very gallant
and generous Reſolutions in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:100491:176"/>
To exemplifie the <hi>Immortality of
the Soul,</hi> he needeth not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the <hi>Philoſophers</hi>-ſtone. His
own ſtore furniſheth him with a moſt
pregnant one of reviving a Plant
(the ſame numerical Plant) out of
his own aſhes. But under his favour,
I believe his experiment will fail, if
under the notion of the ſame, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
all the Accidents that
firſt accompanied that Plant; for
ſince in the aſhes there remaineth
onely the fixed Salt, I am very
confident, that all the Colour,
and much of the Odour and Taſte
of it, is flown away with the Volatile
Salt.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould I ſay of his making
ſo particular a Narration of perſonal
things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and private thoughts of his
own; the knowledge whereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
much conduce to any mans bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment?
(which I make account
is the chief end of his writing this
Diſcourſe.) As where he ſpeaketh of
the ſoundneſs of his Body, of the
courſe of his Diet, of the coolneſs of
his Blood at the Summer-Solſtice
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100491:177"/>
of his age, of his neglect of an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph;</hi>
how long he hath lived, or
may live; what <hi>Popes, Emperours,
Kings, Grand-Seigniors,</hi> he hath
been Contemporary unto, and the
like: Would it not be thought
that he hath a ſpecial good opinion
of himſelf, (and indeed he hath
reaſon) when he maketh ſuch great
Princes the Landmarks in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology
of himſelf? Surely, if he
were to write by retale the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of his own Story and Life, it
would be a notable <hi>Romance,</hi> ſince
he telleth us in one total Sum, it is a
continued Miracle of thirty years.
Though he creepeth gently upon us
at the firſt, yet he groweth a <hi>Gyant,</hi>
an <hi>Atlas</hi> (to uſe his own expreſſion)
at the laſt. But I will not cenſure
him, as he that made Notes upon
<hi>Balſac</hi>'s Letters, and was angry
with him for vexing his Readers
with Stories of his <hi>Cholicks,</hi> and
voiding of Gravel. I leave this kind
of expreſſions, without looking fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into them.</p>
                  <p>In the next place (my <hi>Lord</hi>) I
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:100491:177"/>
ſhall take occaſion from our Author's
ſetting ſo main a difference between
moral Honeſty and Vertue, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vertuous (to uſe his own phraſe)
out of an inbred loyalty to Vertue;
and on the other ſide, being vertuous
for a rewards ſake; to diſcourſe a
little concerning <hi>Vertue</hi> in this life,
and the effects of it afterwards.
Truely (my <hi>Lord</hi>) however he
ſeemeth to prefer this later, I cannot
but value the other much before
it, if we regard the nobleneſs and
heroickneſs of the nature and mind
from whence they both proceed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And if we conſider the Journeys end,
to which each of them carrieth us, I
am confident the firſt yieldeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the ſecond, but indeed both
meet in the period of Beatitude. To
clear this point (which is very well
worth the wiſeſt man's ſeriouſeſt
thought) we muſt conſider, what it
is that bringeth us to this excellent
State, to be happy in the other
World of Eternity and Immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
It is agreed on all hands to be
God's Grace and Favour to us: But
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:100491:178"/>
all do not agree by what ſteps his
Grace produceth this effect. Herein
I ſhall not trouble your Lordſhip
with a long Diſcourſe, how that
Grace worketh in us, (which yet I
will in a word touch anon, that you
may conceive what I underſtand
Grace to be) but will ſuppoſe it to
have wrought its effect in us in this
life, and from thence examine what
hinges they are that turn us over to
<hi>Beatitude</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> in the next:
Some conſider God as a Judge,
that rewardeth or puniſheth men,
according as they co-operated with,
or repugned to, the Grace he gave.
That according as their actions
pleaſe or diſpleaſe him, he is well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
towards them, or angry with
them; and accordingly maketh them,
to the purpoſe, and very home, feel
the effects of his kindneſs or indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Others that fly a higher pitch,
and are ſo happy,
<q>—Vt rerum poterint cognoſcere
cauſas,</q>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:100491:178"/>
do conceive that Beatitude and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
in the other life, are effects
that neceſſarily and orderly flow
out of the Nature of thoſe Cauſes
that begot them in this life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
engaging God Almighty to give
a ſentence, and act the part of a
Judge, according to the ſtate of
our Cauſe, as it ſhall appear upon
the Accuſations and pleadings at
his great <hi>Bar.</hi> Much of which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of expreſſion, is Metaphorical;
and rather adapted to contain vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
minds in their Duties (that are
awed with the thought of a ſevere
Judge, ſifting every minute-action
of theirs) than ſuch as we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
every circumſtance to paſs
ſo in reality, as the literal ſound
of the words ſeems to infer in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
conſtruction: and yet all
that is true too, in its genuine
ſence.) But, my <hi>Lord,</hi> theſe more
penetrating men, and that, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
are vertuous upon higher
and ſtronger Motives (for they true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſolidly know, why they are
ſo) do conſider, that what impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100491:179"/>
are once made in the ſpiritual
Subſtance of a Soul, and what
affections it hath once contracted,
do ever remain in it, till a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and diametrically contradicting
judgement and affection, do obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
it, and expel it thence. This
is the reaſon why <hi>Contrition, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi>
and <hi>Hatred</hi> for <hi>Sins</hi> paſt, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
us. If then the <hi>Soul</hi> do go
out of the Body with impreſſions
and affections to the Objects and
pleaſures of this life, it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
lingreth after them; and as
<hi>Virgil</hi> (learnedly, as well as wittily)
ſaith,
<q>
                        <l>—Quae gratia currum,</l>
                        <l>Armorumque fuit vivis, quae cura
nitentes</l>
                        <l>Paſcere equos, eadem ſequitur tellu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
repoſtos.</l>
                     </q>
But that being a State wherein
thoſe Objects neither are, nor can
be enjoyed, it muſt needs follow
that ſuch a Soul muſt be in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
anguiſh, ſorrow and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:100491:179"/>
for being deprived of them;
and for want of that it ſo much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth,
will neglect all other content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
it might have, as not having
a reliſh or taſte moulded and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the ſavouring of them;
but like feavoriſh tongues, that
when they are even ſcorched with
heat, take no delight in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingeſt
liquors, but the ſweeteſt
drinks ſeem bitter to them, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their overflowing Gall: So
they even hate whatſoever good
is in their power, and thus pine
away a long Eternity. In which
the ſharpneſs and activity of their
pain, anguiſh, and ſad condition, is
to be meaſured by the ſenſibleneſs
of their Natures: which being then
ſpiritual, is in a manner infinitely
more than any torment that in this
life can be inflicted upon a dull
groſs body. To this add, the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
it muſt be to them, to ſee
how ineſtimable and infinite a good
they have loſt; and loſt meerly by
their own fault, and for momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
trifles, and childrens play;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:100491:180"/>
and that it was ſo eaſie for them to
have gained it, had they remained
but in their right ſenſes, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
themſelves according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Reaſon.</hi> And then judge in
what a tortured condition they
muſt be, of remorſe and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelves for their moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupine
and ſenſleſs madneſs. But if
on the other ſide, a Soul be releaſed
out of this <hi>Priſon</hi> of clay and fleſh,
with affections ſetled upon Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
goods, as <hi>Truth, knowledge,</hi>
and the like; and that it be grown
to an irkſome diſlike of the flat
pleaſures of this World; and look
upon carnal and ſenſual Objects
with a diſdainful eye, as diſcerning
the contemptible Inanity in them,
that is ſet off only by their paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
outſide; and above all, that it
hath a longing deſire to be in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of that ſupereminent Cauſe
of Cauſes, in which they know
are heaped up the <hi>Treaſurers</hi> of all
<hi>Beauty, Knowledge, Truth, Delight,</hi>
and good whatſoever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100491:180"/>
are impatient at the <hi>Delay,</hi>
and reckon all their Abſence from
him as a tedious Baniſhment; and
in that regard hate their Life and
Body, as Cauſe of this Divorce: ſuch
a Soul, I ſay, muſt neceſſarily, by
reaſon of the temper it is wrought
into, enjoy immediately at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of the Bodies diſſolution, and
its liberty, more Contentment, more
Joy, more true Happineſs, than it is
poſſible for a heart of fleſh to have
ſcarce any ſcantling of, much leſs to
comprehend.</p>
                  <p>For immenſe Knowledge is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to it, as I have touched before.
<hi>Truth,</hi> which is the adequated and
ſatisfying Object of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
is there diſplayed in her
own Colours, or rather without
any.</p>
                  <p>And that which is the <hi>Crown</hi> of
all, and in reſpect of which all the
reſt is nothing; that infinite Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which above all things this Soul
thirſteth to be united unto, cannot
for his own Goodneſs ſake, deny
his Embraces to ſo affectionate a
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:100491:181"/>
                     <hi>Creature,</hi> and to ſuch an enflamed
Love. If he ſhould, then were that
Soul, for being the beſt, and for
loving him moſt, condemned to be
the unhappieſt. For what Joy could
ſhe have in any thing, were ſhe barr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from what ſhe ſo infinitely lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?
But ſince the Nature of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
and excellent things is to ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
down their propitious Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whereſoever there is a Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of receiving them, and no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
to keep them out (like the Sun
that illuminateth the whole Air, if
no Cloud, or ſolid opacous Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene)
it followeth clearly, that
this infinite Sun of Juſtice, this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
Ocean of Goodneſs, cannot
chuſe but inviron with his Beams,
and repleniſh even beyond ſatiety
with his delightſome Waters, a ſoul
ſo prepared and tempered to receive
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No</hi> (my <hi>Lord</hi>) to make uſe of
this Diſcourſe, and apply it to what
begot it; be pleaſed to determine,
which way will deliver us eveneſt
and ſmootheſt to this happy end
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:100491:181"/>
of our <hi>Journey:</hi> To be vertuous for
hope of a Reward, and through
fear of Puniſhment; or to be ſo
out of a natural and inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Vertue,</hi> for <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
ſake? Surely one in this latter
condition, not onely doth thoſe
things which will bring him to
<hi>Beatitude;</hi> but he is ſo ſecured,
in a manner, under an Armour of
<hi>Proof,</hi> that he is almoſt invulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
he can ſcarce miſcarry, he
hath not ſo much as an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to work contrarily; the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring
Baits of this <hi>World</hi> tempt
him not; he diſliketh, he hateth,
even his neceſſarry Commerce with
them whilſt he liveth. On the
other ſide, the Hireling that ſteereth
his courſe by his Reward and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
doth well, I confeſs;
but he doth it with Reluctance;
he carrieth the <hi>Ark,</hi> God's Image,
his Soul, ſafely home, it is true,
but he loweth pitifully after his
Calves, that he leaveth behind him
among the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> In a word,
he is <hi>vertuous;</hi> but if he might
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100491:182"/>
ſafely, he would do <hi>vicious</hi> things
(And hence be the ground in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if ſo I might ſay, of our <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</hi>)
Methinks two ſuch minds
may not unfitly be compared to
two Maids, whereof one hath a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſprinkling of the Green ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and hath more mind to <hi>Aſhes,
Chalk</hi> or <hi>Leather,</hi> than meats of
ſolid and good nouriſhment, but
forbeareth them, knowing the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
condition of <hi>Health</hi> it will
bring her to: But the other having
a ruddy, vigorous and perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and enjoying a compleat,
entire <hi>Encraſie,</hi> delights in no food
but of good nouriture, and loaths
the other Delights. <hi>Her Health</hi> is
diſcovered in her looks, and ſhe is
ſecure from any danger of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady,
whereas the other for all her
good Diet, beareth in her Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome ſickly Teſtimony of her
depraved Appetite; and if ſhe be
not very <hi>wary,</hi> ſhe is in danger of a
relapſe.</p>
                  <p>It falleth fit in this place to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our Authors apprehenſion of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:100491:182"/>
the end of ſuch honeſt <hi>Worthies</hi> and
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> (as he calleth them)
that died before <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Whether any of them could
be ſaved, or no? Truly, my <hi>Lord,</hi>
I make no doubt at all, but if any
followed in the whole <hi>Tenor</hi> of
their lives, the Dictamens of right
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> but that their journey was
ſecure to <hi>Heaven.</hi> Out of the former
Diſcourſe appeareth what temper
of mind is neceſſary to get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>And,</hi> that <hi>Reaſon</hi> would
dictate ſuch a temper to a perfectly
judicious man, (though but in the
ſtate of <hi>Nature</hi>) as the beſt and
moſt rational for him, I make no
doubt at all. But it is moſt true,
they are exceeding few (if any) in
whom <hi>Reaſon</hi> worketh clearly, and
is not overſwayed by <hi>Paſſion</hi> and
terrene <hi>Affections;</hi> they are few
that can diſcern what is reaſonable
to be done in every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
<q>
                        <l>—Pauci, quos aequus amavit</l>
                        <l>

                        <l>Diis geniti, potuere.—</l>
                     </q>
And fewer, that knowing what is
beſt, can win of themſelves to do
accordingly; (<hi>Video meliora pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boque
deteriora ſequor,</hi> being moſt
mens caſes) ſo that after all that
can be expected at the hands of
Nature and Reaſon in their beſt
Habit, ſince the lapſe of them, we
may conclude it would have been
a moſt difficult thing for any man,
and a moſt impoſſible one for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
to attain unto <hi>Beatitude,</hi>
if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not come to teach,
and by his example to ſhew us the
way.</p>
                  <p>And this was the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of his
Incarnation, teaching Life and
Death: For being God, we could
not doubt his Veracity, when
he tolds us news of the other
world; having all things in his
Power, and yet enjoying none of
the Delights of this Life, no man
ſhould ſtick at foregoing them,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100491:183"/>
ſince his Example ſheweth all men,
that ſuch a courſe is beſt; whereas
few are capable of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of
it: And for his laſt Act, dying
in ſuch an afflicted manner; he
taught us how the ſecureſt way
to ſtep immediately into Perfect
Happineſs, is to be crucified to
all the deſires, Delights and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments
of this <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to come back to our <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian:</hi>
Truly (my <hi>Lord</hi>) I muſt
needs pay him, as a due, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
his pious Diſcourſes
to be Excellent and Pathetical
ones, containing worthy Motives,
to incite one to Vertue, and to
deter one from Vice; thereby to
gain <hi>Heaven,</hi> and to avoid <hi>Hell.</hi>
Aſſuredly he is owner of a ſolid
Head, and of a ſtrong generous
Heart. Where he employeth his
thoughts upon ſuch things, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
to no higher, or more abſtruſe
<hi>Principles,</hi> than ſuch as occur in
ordinary Converſation with the
World, or in the common Tract
of Study and Learning; I know
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:100491:184"/>
no man would ſay better. But
when he meeteth with ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as his next, concerning the
<hi>Reſurrection of the Body,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
after deep Meditation, upon
the moſt abſtracted Principles and
Speculations of the <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi>
one hath much ado to ſolve the
appearing Contradictions in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
There,</hi> I do not at all wonder,
he ſhould tread a little awry, and
go aſtray in the dark: for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his courſe of life hath not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him to allow much time
unto the unwinding of ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
and abſtracted Subtleties.
But if it had, I believe his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts are ſuch, as he might have
kept the Chair from moſt men I
know: For even where he roveth
wideſt, it is with ſo much wit and
ſharpneſs, as putteth me in mind of
a great mans Cenſure upon <hi>Joſeph
Scaliger</hi>'s <hi>Cyclometrica,</hi> (a matter
he was not well verſed in) That
he had rather err ſo ingeniouſly
as he did, than hit upon <hi>Truth</hi> in
that heavy manner, as the <hi>Jeſuit</hi>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:100491:184"/>
his <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> ſtuffeth his <hi>Books.</hi>
Moſt aſſuredly his wit and ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in this Diſcourſe, is of the
fineſt <hi>Standard,</hi> and his inſight
into ſeverer <hi>Learning,</hi> will appear
as piercing unto ſuch as uſe not
ſtrictly the <hi>Touchſtone</hi> and the <hi>Teſt,</hi>
to examine every piece of the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Coyn, he payeth his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with. But to come to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi>
Methinks it is but a
groſs Conception, to think that
every <hi>Atome</hi> of the preſent indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
Matter of a Body; every
grain of <hi>Aſhes</hi> of a burned <hi>Cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
ſcattered by the Wind
throughout the World, and after
numerous Variations, changed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
into the Body of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, ſhould at the ſounding
of the laſt <hi>Trumpet</hi> be raked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
again from all the corners of
the Earth, and be made up anew
into the ſame <hi>Body</hi> it was before
of the firſt Man. Yet if we will
be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and rely upon
God's Promiſes, we muſt believe
that we ſhall riſe again with the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:100491:185"/>
ſame Body that walked about, did
eat, drink, and live here on Earth;
and that we ſhall ſee our <hi>Saviour</hi>
and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> with the ſame, the
very ſame eyes, wherewith we now
look upon the fading <hi>Glories</hi> of this
comtemptible World.</p>
                  <p>How ſhall theſe ſeeming Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
be reconciled? If the latter
be true, why ſhould not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
be admitted? To explicate
this Riddle the better, give me
leave to ask your Lordſhip, if your
Lordſhip, if you now ſee the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi>
the <hi>Enſigns,</hi> the <hi>Arms,</hi> and
other Martial Preparations at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
with the ſame Eyes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
many years agone you looked
upon <hi>Porphyrie</hi>'s and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s
Leaſes there? I doubt not but you
will anſwer me, Aſſuredly with
the very ſame. Is that <hi>Noble</hi> and
<hi>Graceful Perſon</hi> of yours, that
begetteth both <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi>
in every one that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon it? Is that Body of
yours, that now is grown to ſuch
comely and full Dimenſions, as
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:100491:185"/>
                     <hi>Nature</hi> can give her none more
advantagious; the ſame Perſon,
the ſame Body, which your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Excellent Mother bore
nine Months in her Chaſt and
Honoured Womb, and that your
Nurſe gave ſuck unto? Moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is the ſame. And yet if
you conſider it well, it cannot be
doubted, but that ſublunary Matter,
being in a perpetual flux, and in
bodies which have internal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Heat</hi> and Motion, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
tranſpiring out to make
room for the ſupply of new Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
at the length, in long proceſs
of time, all is ſo changed, as that
<hi>Ship</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> may as well be called
the ſame Ship that was there two
hundred years before, and whereof
(be reaſon of the continual repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
not one foot of the <hi>Timber</hi>
is remaining in her that builded
her at the firſt, as this <hi>Body</hi> now
can be called the ſame it was forty
years agone, unleſs ſome higher
conſideration keep up the <hi>Identity</hi>
of it. Now what that is, let us
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:100491:186"/>
examine, and whether or no it will
reach to our difficulty of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi>
Let us conſider then,
how that which giveth the Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Individuation to a <hi>Body,</hi> is
the Subſtantial Form. As long as
that remaineth the ſame, though
the Matter be in a continual Flux
and Motion, yet the Thing is ſtill
the ſame. There is not one drop
of the ſame Water in the <hi>Thames,</hi>
that ran down by <hi>White-Hall</hi>
yeſternight; yet no man will deny,
but that is the ſame River that was
in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, as long
as it is ſupplied from the ſame
Common Stock, the <hi>Sea.</hi> Though
this Example reacheth not home, it
illuſtrateth the thing. If then the
Form remain abſolutely the ſame
after ſeparation from the Matter,
that it was in the Matter, (which
can happen only to Forms, that
ſubſiſt by themſelves, as humane
<hi>Souls)</hi> it followeth then, That
whenſoever it is united to Matter
again, (all Matter coming out of
the ſame Common Magazine) it
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100491:186"/>
maketh again the ſame Man, with
the ſame Eyes, and all the ſame
Limbs that were formerly. Nay,
he is compoſed of the ſame Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
Matter; for it hath the ſame
Diſtinguiſher and Individuator, to
wit, the ſame Form or <hi>Soul.</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conſidered ſingly by it ſelf, hath
no Diſtinction: All Matter is in
it ſelf the ſame; we muſt fancy it,
as we do the indigeſted <hi>Chaos;</hi> it
is a uniformly wide <hi>Ocean.</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize
a few drops of the <hi>Sea,</hi>
by filling a Glaſs-full of them,
then that Glaſs-full is diſtinguiſhed
from all the reſt of the watery
<hi>Bulk:</hi> But return back thoſe few
drops to from whence they were
taken, and the Glaſs-full that even
now had an Individuation by it
ſelf, loſeth that, and groweth one
and the ſame with the other main
Stock: Yet if you fill your Glaſs
again, whereſoever you take it up,
ſo it be of the ſame Uniform <hi>Bulk</hi>
of Water you had before, it is the
ſame Glaſs-full of Water that you
had. But as I ſaid before, this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:100491:187"/>
fitteth entirely, no more
than the other did. In ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
ſpeculations, where we
muſt conſider Matter without
Form (which hath no actual Being)
we muſt not expect adequated Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
in Nature. But enough is
ſaid to make a Speculative man
ſee, that if <hi>God</hi> ſhould joyn the
<hi>Soul</hi> of a lately dead man, (even
whilſt his dead Corpſe ſhould lye
entire in his winding-ſheet here)
unto a <hi>Body</hi> made of Earth, taken
from ſome Mountain in <hi>America;</hi> it
were moſt true and certain, that
the Body he ſhould then lye by,
were the ſame Identical Body he
lived with before his <hi>Death,</hi> and
late <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> It is evident, that
<hi>Sameneſs, Thiſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Thatneſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
not to Matter by it ſelf,
(for a general Indifference runneth
through it all) but onely as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
and individuated by the
Form. Which, in our Caſe, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the ſame <hi>Soul</hi> doth, it muſt be
underſtood always to be the ſame
Matter and Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:100491:187"/>
This Point thus paſſed over, I
may piece to it what our <hi>Author</hi>
ſaith, of a <hi>Magazine</hi> of Subſiſtent
Forms, reſiding firſt in the <hi>Chaos,</hi>
and hereafter (when the World
ſhall have been deſtroyed by fire)
in the general heap of <hi>Aſhes:</hi> out
of which God's Voice did, and
ſhall draw them out, and clothe
them with Matter. This Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
were handſome for a <hi>Poet,</hi>
or <hi>Rhetorician</hi> to ſpeak; but in a
<hi>Philoſopher,</hi> that ſhould ratiocinate
ſtrictly and rigorouſly, I cannot
admit it. For certainly, there are
no Subſiſtent Forms of <hi>Corporeal</hi>
things; (excepting the <hi>Soul</hi> of
man, which beſides being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Form, hath another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Conſideration belonging to
it, too long to ſpeak of here.) But
whenſoever that Compound is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
the Form periſheth with
the whole. And for the Natural
Production of <hi>Corporeal</hi> things, I
conceive it to be wrought out by
the Action and Paſſion of the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
among themſelves; which
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:100491:188"/>
introducing new Tempers and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
into the Bodies where
theſe Conflicts paſs; new Forms
ſucceed old ones, when the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
are raiſed to ſuch a height,
as can no longer conſiſt with the
preceding Form, and are in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Degree to fit the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one, which they uſher in. The
Myſtery of all, which I have at
large unfolded in my above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Treatiſe of the <hi>Immortality of
the Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay no more to the firſt
Part of our <hi>Phyſician</hi>'s Diſcourſe
after I have obſerved, how his
Conſequence is no good one; where
he inferreth, That if the <hi>Devils</hi>
fore-knew, who would be Damned
or Saved, it would ſave them the
<hi>Labour,</hi> and end their work of
tempting Mankind to miſchief and
evil. For whatſoever their Moral
Deſign and Succeſs be in it, their
Nature impelleth them to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
doing it. For on the one
ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de, it is Active in the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
(as being pure <hi>Acts,</hi> that is,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:100491:188"/>
                     <hi>Spirits,</hi>) ſo on the other ſide, they
are Malign in as great an Exceſs:
By the one they muſt be always
working, whereſoever they may
work, (like Water in a Veſſel full
of holes, that will run out of every
one of them which is not ſtopped:)
By the other, their whole Work
muſt be malicious and miſchievous.
Joyning then both theſe Qualities
together, it is evident, they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be tempting mankind, though
they know they ſhall be fruſtrate of
their Moral End.</p>
                  <p>But were it not time that I made
an end? Yes, it is more than time.
And therefore having once paſſed
the limit that confined what was
becoming, the next ſtep carried me
into the <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Errour;</hi> which
being Infinite, and therefore more
or leſs bearing no proportion in
it; I will proceed a little further,
to take a ſhort Survey of his <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part,</hi> and hope for as eaſie
<hi>Pardon</hi> after this Addition, to
my ſudden and indigeſted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:100491:189"/>
as if I had encloſed them up
now.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Methinks,</hi> he beginneth with
ſomewhat an affected Diſcourſe,
to prove his natural Inclination to
<hi>Charity;</hi> which <hi>Vertue</hi> is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Theam</hi> of all the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his Diſcourſe. And I doubt
he miſtaketh the loweſt <hi>Orbe</hi> or
<hi>Lembe</hi> of that high <hi>Seraphick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
for the top and perfection of it;
and maketh a kind of humane
Compaſſion to be <hi>Divine Charity.</hi>
He will have it to be a general
way of doing good: It is true, he
addeth then, <hi>for God's ſake;</hi> but
he allayeth that again, with ſaying,
he will have that good done, as
by Obedience, and to accompliſh
God's will; and looketh at the
Effects it worketh upon our Souls,
but in a narrow compaſs; like one
in the vulgar throng, that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
God as a Judge, and as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
or a Puniſher. <hi>Whereas</hi>
perfect <hi>Charity,</hi> is that vehement
Love of God for his own ſake, for
his Goodneſs, for his Beauty, for
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:100491:189"/>
his Excellency, that carrieth all the
motions of our Soul directly and
violently to Him; and maketh a
man diſdain, or rather hate all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles
that may retard his journey
to Him. And that Face of it that
looketh toward Mankind with
whom we live, and warmeth us to
do others good, is but like the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
of the main Stream, that
ſwelling above its Banks runneth
over in a multitude of little chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.</p>
                  <p>I am not ſatisfied, that in the
Likeneſs which he putteth between
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> he maketh the
difference between them, to be
but ſuch as between two Creatures
that reſemble one another. For
between theſe, there is ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion;
but between the others,
none at all. In the examining of
which Diſcourſe, wherein the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
obſerveth, that no two Faces
are ever ſeen to be perfectly alike;
nay, no two <hi>Pictures</hi> of the ſame
Face, were exactly made ſo; I
could take occaſion to inſert a
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:100491:190"/>
ſubtil and delightful Demonſtration
of Mr. <hi>Whites,</hi> wherein he ſheweth,
how it is impoſſible that two Bodies
(for example two <hi>Bouls</hi>)ſhould ever
be made exactly like one another;
nay, not rigorouſly equal in any one
Accident, as namely in weight, but
that ſtill there will be ſome little
difference and inequality between
them (the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of which Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
our <hi>Author</hi> medled not with)
were it not that I have been ſo long
already, as Digreſſions were now
very unſeaſonable.</p>
                  <p>Shall I commend or cenſure our
<hi>Author</hi> for believing ſo well of his
acquired knowledge, as to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
at the thought of not being
able to leave it a Legacy among
his Friends; Or ſhall I examine,
whether it be not a high injury to
wiſe and gallant <hi>Princes,</hi> who out
of the generouſneſs and noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their <hi>Nature,</hi> do patronize
Arts and learned Men, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
their ſo doing to vanity of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100491:190"/>
deſiring Praiſe, or to fear of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach?</p>
                  <p>But let theſe paſs: I will not
engage any that may be-friend
him, in a quarrel againſt him. But
I may ſafely produce <hi>Epictetus</hi> to
contradict him, when he letteth
his kindneſs engulf him in deep
afflictions for a friend: For he will
not allow his wiſe man to have an
inward relenting, a troubled feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or compaſſion of anothers
misfortunes. That diſordereth the
one, without any good to the
other. Let him afford all the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
and relievings in his power,
but without intermingling himſelf
in others <hi>Woe;</hi> As <hi>Angels,</hi> that do
us good, but have no paſſion for
us. But this Gentleman's kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
goeth yet further: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
his love of a <hi>Friend</hi> to his
love of <hi>God;</hi> the Union of Friends
Souls by affection, to the Union
of the three Perſons in the <hi>Trinity,</hi>
and to the <hi>Hypoſtatical Vnion</hi> of
two Natures in one <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the
Words <hi>Incarnation.</hi> Moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:100491:191"/>
he expreſſeth himſelf to be
a right good-natur'd man. But
if St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> retracted ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
his pathetical Expreſſions
for the Death of his Friend, ſaying,
<hi>They ſavoured more of the Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Declamations of a young Orator,
than of the grave Confeſſion of a
devout Chriſtian,</hi> (or ſomewhat to
that purpoſe) What cenſure upon
himſelf may we expect of our
<hi>Phyſician,</hi> if ever he make any
Retraction of this Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his <hi>Religion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is no ſmall misfortune to him,
that after ſo much time ſpent, and
ſo many places viſited in a curious
Search, by travelling after the
Acquiſition of ſo many Languages;
after the wading ſo deep in Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
as appeareth by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Inventory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Particular he
maketh of himſelf: The reſult
of all this ſhould be, to profeſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly
he had ſtudied enough.
onely to become a <hi>Sceptick;</hi> and
that having run through all ſorts
of <hi>Learning,</hi> he could find reſt
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:100491:191"/>
and ſatisfaction in none. This, I
confeſs, is the unlucky fate of
thoſe that light upon wrong <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
But Mr. <hi>White</hi> teacheth us,
how the <hi>Theorems</hi> and <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of <hi>Phyſicks</hi> may be linked
and chained together, as ſtrongly,
and as continuedly as they are in
the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> if men would
but apply themſelves to a right
Method of Study. And I do not
find that <hi>Solomon</hi> complained of
Ignorance in the height of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
(as this <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſaith)
but onely, that after he hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acknowledged himſelf igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of nothing, but that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the Natures of all Plants,
from the <hi>Cedar</hi> to the <hi>Hyſſop,</hi> and
was acquainted with all the ways
and paths of Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
he exclaimeth, that all this
is but <hi>Toyl and vexation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
and therefore adviſeth men,
to change Humane Studies into
Divine Contemplations and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="358" facs="tcp:100491:192"/>
I cannot agree to his reſolution
of ſhutting his <hi>Books,</hi> and giving
over the ſearch of Knowledge, and
reſigning himſelf up to Ignorance,
upon the reaſon that moveth him;
as though it were extream <hi>Vanity</hi>
to waſte our days in the purſuit
of that, which by attending but a
little longer (till Death hath cloſed
the eyes of our <hi>Body,</hi> to open thoſe
of our <hi>Soul</hi>) we ſhall gain with
eaſe, we ſhall enjoy by infuſion,
and is an acceſſory of our Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
It is true, as ſoon as <hi>Death</hi>
hath played the Midwife to our
ſecond Birth, our Soul ſhall then
ſee all Truths more freely, than
our Corporal Eyes at our firſt Birth
ſee all Bodies and Colours, by the
natural power of it, as I have
touched already, and not onely
upon the grounds our <hi>Author</hi>
giveth. Yet far be it from us, to
think that time loſt. which in the
mean ſeaſon we ſhall laboriouſly
imploy, to warm our ſelves with
blowing a few little <hi>Sparks</hi> of that
glorious fire, which we ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:100491:192"/>
in one inſtant leap into the
middle of, without danger of
Scorching. And that for two
important <hi>Reaſons;</hi> beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others, too long to mention
here) the one, for the great
advantage we have by Learning
in this life; the other, for the
huge Contentment that the Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of it here (which applyeth
a ſtrong Affection to it) will be unto
us in the next life. The want of
Knowledge in our firſt Mother
(which expoſed her to be eaſily
deceived by the <hi>Sepents</hi> cunning)
was the root of all our enſuing
<hi>Miſery</hi> and <hi>Woe.</hi> It is as true (which
we are taught by irrefragable
Authority) That <hi>Omnis peccans
ignorat:</hi> And the well head of all
the calamities and miſchiefs in all
the World, conſiſteth of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and bitter waters of Ignorance,
Folly and Raſhneſs; to cure which,
the onely Remedy and Antidote,
is the Salt of true <hi>Learning,</hi> the
bitter <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Study,</hi> painful
<hi>Meditation,</hi> and orderly <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:100491:193"/>
I do not mean ſuch <hi>Study,</hi>
as armeth wrangling <hi>Champions</hi>
for clamorous <hi>Schools,</hi> where the
Ability of ſubtil Diſputing to and
fro, is more prized than the retriving
of Truth: But ſuch as filleth the
mind with ſolid and uſeful notions,
and doth not endanger the ſwelling
it up with windy vanities. Beſides,

of a well-tempered mind,
is to converſe familiarly with the
naked and bewitching beauties of
thoſe Miſtreſſes, thoſe Verities
and Sciences, which by fair courting
of them, they gain and enjoy;
and every day bring new freſh ones
to their <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where the ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
never grow old or ſtale. Is there
any thing ſo pleaſing, or ſo profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as this?

                  <p>But now if we conſider the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
we ſhall have in the other
life by our affection to <hi>Sciences,</hi>
and converſation with them in
this, it is wonderful great. Indeed
that affection is ſo neceſſary, as
without it we ſhall enjoy little
contentment in all the knowledge
we ſhall then be repleniſhed with:
for every ones pleaſure in the
poſſeſſion of a good, is to be
meaſured by his precedent <hi>Deſire</hi>
of that good, and by the equality
of the taſte and reliſh of him that
feedeth upon it. We ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prepare and make our taſte
before-hand by Aſſuefaction unto,
and by often reliſhing what we
ſhall then be nouriſhed with. That
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> that can drink nothing
but <hi>Beer</hi> or <hi>Ale,</hi> would be ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead,
were he to go into <hi>Spain</hi> or

groweth: whereas a well-experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
<hi>Goinfre,</hi> that can criticize
upon the ſeveral taſtes of Liquors,
would think his <hi>Palate</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>
among thoſe delicious <hi>Nectars</hi>(to

with <hi>Tobacco</hi> the firſt time
he took it? And who could willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be without it, after he was a
while habituated to the uſe of it;
How many examples are there dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of young men, that marrying
upon their Fathers command, not
through precedent affections of
their own, have little comfort in
worthy and handſome Wives, that
others would paſſionately affect?
<hi>Archimedes</hi> loſt his life, for being ſo
raviſhed with the delight of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Demonſtration, that he
could not of a ſudden recal his
extaſied <hi>Spirits</hi> to attend the rude
Souldiers Summons: But inſtead
of him, whoſe mind hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
fed with ſuch ſubtil <hi>Diet,</hi>
how many plain <hi>Country-Gentlemen</hi>
doth your Lordſhip and I know, that
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:100491:194"/>
rate the knowledge of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
at a much higher pitch;
and are extreamly delighted by
converſing with that; whereas the
other would be moſt tedious and
importune to them? We may then
ſafely conclude, That if we will
joy in the <hi>Knowledge</hi> we ſhall have
after <hi>Death,</hi> we muſt in our life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
raiſe within our ſelves earneſt
affections to it, and deſires of it,
which cannot be barren ones; but
will preſs upon us to gain ſome
Knowledge by way of advance
here; and the more we attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
the more we ſhall be in <hi>Love</hi>
with what remaineth behind. To
this reaſon then adding the other,
How knowledge is the ſureſt prop,
and guide of our preſent life; and
how it perfecteth a man in that
which conſtituteth a man, his
<hi>Reaſon;</hi> and how it enableth him
to tread boldly, ſteadily, conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and knowingly in all his ways:
And I am confident, all men that
ſhall hear the Caſe thus debated,
will joyn with me in making it
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:100491:195"/>
a Suit to our <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> that he will
keep his <hi>Books</hi> open, and continue
that <hi>Progreſs</hi> he hath ſo happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
                  <p>But I believe your Lordſhip will
ſcarcely joyn with him in his wiſh,
that we might procreate and beget
Children without the help of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or without any Conjunction
or Commerce with that ſweet and
bewitching <hi>Sex. Plato</hi> taxeth his
fellow <hi>Philoſopher</hi> (though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a learned and brave man) for
not ſacrificing to the <hi>Graces,</hi> thoſe
gentle Female <hi>Goddeſſes.</hi> What
thinketh your Lordſhip of our
<hi>Phyſitian</hi>'s bitter cenſure of that
action, which <hi>Mahomet</hi> maketh the
Eſſence of his <hi>Paradiſe?</hi> Indeed,
beſides thoſe his unkindneſſes, or
rather frowardneſſes, at that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted
<hi>Sex</hi> (which muſt needs
take it ill at his hands) methinketh
he ſetteth Marriage at too low a
rate, which is aſſuredly the higheſt
and divineſt link of humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And where he ſpeaketh of
<hi>Cupid,</hi> and of <hi>Beauty,</hi> it is in ſuch
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:100491:195"/>
a phraſe, as putteth me in mind of
the Learned <hi>Greek Reader</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
his courting of his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi>
out of <hi>Stephens</hi> his <hi>Theſaurus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My next Obſervation upon his
Diſcourſe, draweth me to a <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
conſideration of the Nature of
an exact <hi>Syllogiſm:</hi> which kind
of reflection, though it uſe to
open the door in the courſe of
Learning and Study; yet it will
near ſhut it in my Diſcourſe, which
my following the thred that my
<hi>Author</hi> ſpinneth, aſſigneth to this
place. If he had well and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſidered all that is required
to that ſtrict way of managing our
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> he would not have cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for condemning the
fourth Figure, out of no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
but becauſe it was not conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to his own Principle; that it
would not fit with the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
himſelf had laid; though it do
with Reaſon (ſaith he) and be
conſonant to that, which indeed it
doth not, at all times, and in all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:100491:196"/>
In a perfect <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm,</hi>
the Predicate muſt be iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with the Subject, and each
extream with the middle term, and
ſo conſequently, all three with one
another. But in <hi>Galen</hi>'s fourth
Figure, the caſe may ſo fall out,
as theſe Rules will not be current
there.</p>
                  <p>As for the good and excellency
that he conſidereth in the worſt
things, and how far from Solitude
any man is in a Wilderneſs; <hi>Theſe</hi>
are (in his Diſcourſe) but <hi>equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
conſiderations of Good,</hi> and of
<hi>Lowlineſs:</hi> Nor are they any
ways pertinent to the Mortality of
that part, where he treateth of
them.</p>
                  <p>I have much ado to believe, what
he ſpeaketh confidently, That he is
more beholding to <hi>Morpheus,</hi> for
Learned and Rational, as well as
pleaſing <hi>Dreams,</hi> than to <hi>Mercury</hi>
for ſmart and facetious Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
whom <hi>Saturn</hi> (it ſeemeth by his
relation) hath looked aſquint upon
in his Geniture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="367" facs="tcp:100491:196"/>
In his concluding <hi>Prayer,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he ſummeth up all he wiſheth;
methinketh his Arrow is not winged
with that fire, which I ſhould have
expected from him upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion:
For it is not the peace of
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> nor the bridling up of
ones affections, that expreſſeth the
higheſt dedlightfulneſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſtate of a perfect <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> It
is love onely that can give us
<hi>Heaven</hi> upon Earth, as well as in
Heaven; and bringeth us thither
too: So that the <hi>Thuſcan Virgil</hi> had
reaſon to ſay,
<q>
                        <l>—In alte dolcezze</l>
                        <l>Non ſi puo gioio, ſe non amando.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Love muſt be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the nobleſt and higheſt
Object, not terminated in our
Friends. But of this tranſcendent
and divine part of <hi>Charity,</hi> that
looketh directly and immediately
upon God himſelf; and that is
the Intrinſecal Form, the utmoſt
Perfection, the ſcope and final Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:100491:197"/>
of true <hi>Religion,</hi> (this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
intended <hi>Theam,</hi> as I conceive)
I have no occaſion to ſpeak any
thing, ſince my <hi>Author</hi> doth but
tranſiently mention it; and that
too, in ſuch a phraſe as ordinary <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſms</hi>
ſpeak of to vulgar Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>Thus, my Lord, having run
through the Book (God knows
how ſleightly, upon ſo great a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den)
which your Lordſhip com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to give you an account
of, there remaineth yet a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
task upon me to perform,
which is, to excuſe my ſelf of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
for daring to conſider
any Moles in that Face, which
you had marked for a Beauty.
But who ſhall well conſider my
manner of proceeding in theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,
will free me from that Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
I offer not at <hi>Judging</hi> the
Prudence and Wiſdom of this

to be too well verſed; your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
are of a higher and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
<hi>Strain,</hi> and that concerns the
welfare of millions of men:

                  <p>Such little Studies as theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
