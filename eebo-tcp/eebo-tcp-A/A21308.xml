            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PROHEME OF SIR THOMAS ELIOT KNIGHT, INTO <hi>his booke called the Castell of Health.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Alen</hi> the moſt excellent Phiſition feared, that in writing a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious doctrine for the curing of ſicknes, he ſhould loſe all his labour, for as much as no man almoſt did endeuour himſelfe to the finding of truth, but that all men did ſo much eſteeme riches, poſſeſſions, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and pleaſures, that they ſuppoſed them, which were ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in any parte of Sapience, to bee mad or diſtract of their wittes, for as much as they deemed the chiefe Sapience, which is in knowledge of things belonging as wel to God as to man, to haue no being. Since this noble writer found that lacke in his time, when there floriſhed in ſundry Countries a great multitude of men, excellent in all kindes of learning, as it dooth yet appeare by ſome of their workes, why ſhould I be grieued with reproches, wherewith ſome of my Countrey doe recompence me, for my labours taken without hope of temporall reward, only for the feruent affection, which I haue euer borne toward the publique weale of my Countrey? A worthie matter, ſaith one, Sir <hi>Thomas Elyot</hi> is become a Phiſition, and writeth in Phiſicke, which beſeemeth not a Knight, he might haue been much better occupied. Truely if they will call him a Phiſition, which is ſtudious about the weale of his Countrey, I voutchſafe they ſo name me, for during my life, I will in that affection alway continue. And why, I pray you, ſhould men haue in diſdayne or ſmall reputation the ſcience of Phiſicke? Which being well vnderſtood, truely experienced, and diſcreetly ordered, dooth conſerue health, without the which all pleaſures be painefull, riches vnprofitable, company annoyance, ſtrength turned to feeblenes, beautie to lothſomneſſe, ſences are diſperſed; eloquence interrupted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance confounded, which hath been conſidered of wiſe men, not only of the priuate eſtate, but alſo of Emperours, Kings, and other great Princes, who for the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſal neceſſitie, and incomparable vtility, which they perceiued to be in that ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Phiſicke, they did not only aduance &amp; honour it with ſpeciall priuiledges, but alſo diuers &amp; many of them were therein right ſtudious, in ſo much as <hi>Iuba</hi> the King of <hi>Mauritanie</hi> &amp; <hi>Lybia,</hi> found out the vertuous qualities of the hearbe called <hi>Euforbium Gentius</hi> King of <hi>Illyria,</hi> found the vertues of Gentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The hearbe Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia tooke his name of King <hi>Lyſimachus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mithridates</hi> the great King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> found firſt the vertues of Scordion, and alſo inuented the famous medicine againſt poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, called <hi>Mithridate.

            <p>But yet one thing much greeueth me, that notwithſtanding I haue euer honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; ſpecially fauoured the reuerend Colledge of approued Phiſitions, yet ſome of them hearing me ſpoken of haue ſaid in deriſion, that although I were pretily ſeene in hiſtorics, yet being not learned in Phiſicke, I haue put in my booke diuers errors, in preſuming to write of hearbes and medicines.

Moreouer I wot not why Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be angry with me, ſince I wrote and did ſet forth the Caſtle of Health for their commoditie, that the vncertaine tokens of vrines, and other excrements ſhould not deceiue them, but that by the true information of the ſicke man, by me inſtructed, they might be the more ſure to prepare medicines conuenient for the diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Alſo to the intent that men obſeruing a good order in diet, and preuenting the great cauſes of ſicknes, they ſhould of thoſe maladies the ſooner be cured. But if Phiſitions be angry, that I haue written Phiſick in Engliſh, let them remember that the <hi>Greekes</hi> wrote in Greeke, the <hi>Romaynes</hi> in Latine, <hi>Auicenna</hi> and the other in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabike, which were their owne proper and maternall tongues. And if they had been as much attached with enuie &amp; couetiſe, as ſome now ſeeme to be, they would haue deuiſed ſome particular language with a ſtrange cypher or fourme of letters, wherein they would haue written their ſcience, which language or letters no man ſhould haue known, that had not profeſſed and practiſed Phiſicke: but thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were Paynims &amp; Iewes, yet in this part of charity they far ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs Chriſtians, they that would not haue ſo neceſſary a knowledge as Phiſick is, to be hid from them which would be ſtudious about it.</p>

               <p>Firſt it ought to bee remembred, that meates hot and moyſt which are qualities of the bloud, are ſoone turned into bloud, and therefore much nouriſheth the bodie.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11925:16"/>
Some meates doe nouriſh but little, hauing little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie with bloud in their qualities. Of them which doe nouriſh: ſome are more groſſe, ſome lighter in dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. The groſſe meate ingendreth groſſe bloud, but where it is well concoct in the ſtomacke and well dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, it maketh the fleſh more firme, and the officiall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers more ſtrong then fine meates. Wherefore of men which vſe much labour or exerciſe, alſo of them which haue very cholerike ſtomackes here in England, groſſe meates may be eaten in a great quantitie: and in a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerike ſtomacke, béefe is better digeſted then a chickens legge, for as much as in a hot ſtomacke fine meates bee ſhortly aduſt and corrupted. Contrariwiſe, in a cold or fleumatike ſtomacke groſſe meate abideth long vudige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and maketh putrified matter: light meates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſuch a ſtomacke be more apt and conuenient.</p>
               <p>The temperate bodie is beſt nouriſhed with a little quantitie of groſſe meates, but of temperate meates in ſubſtance and qualitie they may ſafely eate a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie: foreſeene alway that they eate without gourman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, or leaue without appetite. And here it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that the cholerike ſtomacke doth not deſire ſo much as he may digeſt: the melancholy ſtomacke may not digeſt ſo much as he deſireth: for cold maketh appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, but naturall heate concocteth or boyleth. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, vnnaturall or ſupernaturall heate deſtroyeth appetite and corrupteth digeſtion, as it appeareth in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. Moreouer, fruites and hearbes, ſpecially rawe, would bee eaten in a ſmall quantitie, although the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be very cholerike, for as much as they doe ingender thin watrie bloud apt to receiue putrification, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bée not ſhortly perceiued of him that vſeth it, at length they feele it by ſundrie diſeaſes which are long in comming, and ſhortly ſleieth, or bee hardly eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Finally, exceſſe of meates is to bée abhorred. For as it is ſayd in the booke called <hi>Eccleſiaſticus:</hi> In
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:11925:17"/>
much meate ſhall be ſicknes, &amp; inordinate appetite ſhall approch vnto choler. Semblably the quantity of drinke would bee moderated, that it exceede not, nor bee equall vnto the quantity of meate, ſpecially wine which mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly taken, aydeth nature, and comforteth her: and as the ſayd author of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſayth: Wine is a reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the ſoule and bodie. And <hi>Theogines</hi> ſayth, in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> worke: A large draught of wine is ill, a moderate draught is not euill, but commodious and profitable.</p>

And one thing is to bee well conſidered, that from the creation of the world, vntill the vniuerſal deluge or floud, during which time men liued 8. or 9. hundred yeares, there was none other drink vſed nor knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but water. Alſo the true fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> doctrine, dranke onley water, and yet liued, as <hi>Appollonius,</hi> &amp; other: and in the ſearching out of ſecret and miſticall things, their wits excelled. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer wee haue ſéene men and women of great age, and ſtrong of bodie, which neuer or very ſeldome dranke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drinke then pure water. As by example in Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, although that the countrey be in a very cold quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which proueth that if men from their infancie were accuſtomed to none other drink but to water only mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly vſed, it ſhuld be ſufficient to kéep natural moiſture,

&amp; to cauſe the meat that is eaten, to pierce and deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the places of digeſtion, which are the purpoſes that drinke ſerueth for.</p>
                  <p>But now to the qualities of water after the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence of ancient philoſophers and phiſitions. The rain water af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the opinion of moſt men, if it bee receiued pure and cleane, is moſt ſubtill and penetratiue, of any other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: the next is that, which iſſueth out of a ſpring in the eaſt, and paſſeth ſwiftly amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g great ſtones or rocks: the third is of a cleane riuer, which runneth on great harde ſtones or peples. There hee diuers meanes to trye out which is the beſt water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is lighteſt in poiſe or weight, is beſt. Alſo that whereof commeth leaſt ſkim or froth when it doth boyle, alſo that which will ſooneſt bee hot: Moreouer dip linnen clothes into ſundry waters and after lay them to drie, and that which is ſooneſt drie, the water wherein it was dipped is moſt ſubtill. After a great ſurfet, ſpecially taken with ſuperfluous eating of banquetting meats, cold water dronken is a generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. <hi>Hyppo.</hi> affirmeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in ſharpe and feruent diſeaſes, none other remedy is to be required then water. And <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> will not that children ſhould bee let from drinking of <note place="margin">De ratione vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus in morb. acutis. lib. 3.</note> water, but that when they ſéele themſelues very hot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meales, and doe deſire to drinke water, ſpecially of a cleane fountain they ſhould be ſuffered, alſo <hi>Hippo</hi> ſaith: in ſuch ſicknes whereas thou feareſt, leſt the head ſhould be vehemently grieued, or the mind periſhed, there muſt thou giue either water or white wine allaied with much water. Not withſtanding there be in water cauſes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers diſeaſes, as of ſwelling of the ſpléene and the liuer, it alſo flitteth and ſwimmeth, and it is long or it pierceth, in as much as it is cold and ſlowe in decoction, it looſeth not the belly nor prouoketh vrine. Alſo in this it is vicious, that of his proper nature it maketh no ordure. Finally alway reſpect muſt be had to the perſon that drinketh it, for to yongmen and them that bee hot of complexion, it

                  <hi>PLato</hi> the wiſeſt of all Philoſophers, doth affirme, that wine moderately drunke, nouriſheth and comforteth as wel al the bodie as the ſpirites of man. And therefore God did ordaine it for mankind, as a remedie againſt the incommodities of age, that thereby they ſhould ſeeme to returne vnto youth and forget heauineſſe. Undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wine heateth, and moyſteth the bodie, which qualities chiefly conſerueth nature. And <hi>Galen</hi> of all wines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth that which is yellow and cleere, ſaying: that it is the hotteſt, and white wine leaſt hot.</p>
               <p>And the colour meane betwéen both, of ſemblable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature. The yellow wine which is the proper colour of very hot wines, to old men doth bring theſe commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Firſt it heateth all their members, alſo it purgeth by vrine the watrie ſubſtance of the bloud. Moreouer, the wines which be pale or yellow, and full of ſubſtance doe increaſe bloud, and nouriſhe the bodie, but for the more parte, olde men haue néede of ſuch wines which doe prouoke vrine: for as much as in them doe abound watrie excrementes, or ſuperfluities, and they which do tarry long in the belly be not apt for aged men. Black or déepe red wines and thicke, do bind and congeale that which they doe finde in the bodie, and although ſome of them doe not long abide in the belly, yet they moue not vrine, but rather withdraweth: but yet they do harme to old men, for as much as they do ſtop the conduites of the ſpléene, the liuer and the raines: alſo groſſe wines be beſt for them which deſire to be fat, but it maketh opilations: old wine and cléere is better for them that be fleumatick. <hi>Galen</hi> alſo prohibiteth children to drink any wine, for as <note place="margin">Galen de tuen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſani. lib. 1.</note> much as they be of a hot and moiſt te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature, and ſo is

wine: and therfore it heateth and moiſteth too much their bodies, and filleth their heads with vapours. Moreouer he would, that yong men ſhould drinke little wine, for it ſhall make them prone to furie, and leachery, &amp; that part of the ſoule which is called rationable, it ſhal make trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous and dull: not withſtanding yet it is ſometime pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to mitigate or expell ordure made of choler or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choly. Alſo it profiteth againſt drith, which happeneth in the ſubſtance of the bodie, either by too much labor, or by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proper temperature of age: for wine moiſteth &amp; nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth that, which is too drye, alſo mitigateth and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſharpnes of choler, and purgeth it alſo by vrine &amp; ſweate. Finally as <hi>Theognes</hi> ſayth, much drinking of wineis ill, but moderate drinking of wine is not onely not ill, but alſo commodious and profitable, which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is confirmed by <hi>Ieſus Syrac,</hi> in the booke named <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticus,</hi> ſaying: Wine moderately drunke reioyceth both the body &amp; ſoule. Wherefore to conclude this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there is neither meate nor drinke, in the vſe whereof ought to bee a more diſcreete moderation, then in wine, conſidering that being good and dronke in due time and meaſure, it not only conſerueth naturall &amp; radicall moyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby life indureth, but alſo it helpeth the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal members which belong to digeſtion, to do their office: on the other part being ill or corrupt, or taken out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and meaſure, it doth contrary to all the premiſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it tranſformeth a man or woman, making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beaſtly.

               <head>Of Ale, Beere, Cider, and Whay. CAP. 21.</head>
               <p>I Can neither heare nor reade, that Ale is made and vſed for a common drinke in any other countrie then Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, Ireland, and Pole. The Latine word <hi>Ceruiſia</hi> is indifferent as well to Ale as to Béere. If the corne be good, the water holeſome and cleane, and the Ale or Béere well &amp; perfectly brewed and clenſed, and by the ſpace of ſixe daies and more, ſetled and defecate, it muſt néeds be a neceſſary &amp; conuenient drinke as well in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as in health: conſidering the barly corne, whereof it is made, is commended &amp; vſed in medicine in all parts of the world, &amp; accounted to bee of a ſingular efficacie in reducing the bodie into good temper, ſpecially which is in diſtemperature of heate. For what ancient Phiſition is there that in his workes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth not Ptiſane? which is none other but pure barly brayd in a morter, &amp; ſodden in water, the ſame thing is ſmall and cleane ale or béere, ſauing that perchaunce the drying of the malt is cauſe of more drith to be in the ale then in Ptiſane. And the hops in Béere maketh it colder in operation. But to ſay as I thinke, I ſuppoſe that neither Ale nor Béere is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Wine, conſidering that in them doe lacke the heate and moyſture which is in Wine. For that being moderately vſed, is moſt like to the naturall heat &amp; moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of mans bodie. And alſo the licour of Ale or Béere being more groſſe, do ingender more groſſe vapours and corrupt humours then Wine doth, being dronk in like exceſſe of quantitie.</p>
               <p>As for Cider may not bee good in any condition, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering as I ſayd, that al fruits do ingender ill humours, and doe coole too much naturall heate: but to them which haue abundance of red choler, moderately vſed, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what profiteth in mitigation of exceſſiue heat. But who that will diligently marke in the countries where Cider is vſed for a common drinke, the men and women haue
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11925:32"/>
the colour of their viſage palled, and the ſkinne of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage riueled, although that they be young.</p>
               <p>Whay, if it bee left of the butter, being well ordered, and not dronke vntill it haue a thicke curd of milke ouer it, like to a hat, is a right temperate drinke, for as much as by the vnctuoſitie of the butter, whereof the whay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth ſome portion, it is both moyſt &amp; nouriſhing, and clenſeth the breaſt, &amp; by the ſubtilnes of it ſelfe, it deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſoone from the ſtomack, and is ſhortly digeſted.

But concerning the generall vſage of countries, and admitting the bodies to the perfect ſtate of health, I ſuppoſe that in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande young men, vntil they come to the age of xl. yeres, may well eate three meales in one day, as at breakefaſt, dinner, and ſupper, ſo that betwéene breakefaſt and din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, bée the ſpace of 4. houres, at the leaſt betwéene din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and ſupper 6. houres, and the breakfaſt leſſe then the dinner, &amp; the dinner moderate, that is to ſay, leſſe then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of fulnes of bellie, and the drinke thereunto meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, according to the drines or moiſtnes of the meate.

We ought to grant ſomwhat to time, <note place="margin">Hippo. hor. 18. lib. 1 Gal. de tuenda ſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</note> to age, and to cuſtome: notwithſtanding where great warmenes or dryth greeueth the bodie, there ought the dinner to be leſſe, and the longer diſtance betwéene din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſupper.

Alſo to drinke betweene meales is not lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, except very great thirſt conſtraineth: for it interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

Wherefore he that is thirſtie, let him conſider the occaſion. If it bee of ſalt fleume, let him walke fayre and ſoftly and onely waſhe his mouth and his throate with barly water, or ſmal ale, or lye downe and ſleepe a little, and ſo the thirſt wil paſſe away or at the leaſt be well aſſwaged.</p>

               <p>NOw let this bee a generall rule, that ſundry meates, being diuers in ſubſtance and qualitie, eaten all at one meale, is the greateſt enemie to health that may be, and that ingendreth moſt ſickneſſes, for ſome meates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing groſſe and harde to digeſt, ſome fine and eaſie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,

doe require diuers operations of nature, and diuers temperatures of the ſtomacke, that is to ſay, much heate and temperate heate, which maye not be together at one time.</p>
               <p>Therefore when the fine meate is ſufficiently boyled in the ſtomacke, the groſſe meate is raw, ſo both iuyces, the one good and perfect, the other groſſe and crude, at one time digeſted, and ſent into the veynes and bodie, needes muſt health decay, and ſickneſſes bee ingendred. Likewiſe in diuers meates being of diuers qualities, as where ſome are hot and moiſt, ſome cold and moiſt, ſome hot and dry, ſome cold and drie, according thereunto ſhal the iuyce bee diuers which they make in the body. And like as betwéen the ſaid qualities is contrariety, ſo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhall bee in the bodie an vnequall temperature, for as much as it is not poſſible for a man to eſtéem ſo iuſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, of the qualities of that which he receiueth, that the one ſhall not exceede the other in quantitie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore of the ſaid vnequall mixture, needes muſt enſue corruption and conſequently ſicknes, and therfore to a hole man, it were better to féed at one meale compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently on very groſſe meat only, ſo that it be ſwéete, and his nature doe not abhor it, then on diuers fine meates of ſundry ſubſtance and qualities. I haue known and ſéene olde men and olde women which eating onelie béefe, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, chéeſe, and curdes, haue continued in good healthe, whome I haue proued, that when they haue eaten ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie fine meates at one meale, haue ſoone after felt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues greeued with frettings, and headache, and after that they haue béene hole againe, there hath béene giuen to them one kinde of light meate, they haue done as well therwith as they were wont to do w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> groſſe meats, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they eate it alone, which proueth to be true that which I haue rehearſed. And it is good reaſon, for after the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall opinion of Philoſophers and Phiſitions, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mankind is beſt content with things moſt ſimple

Contrariwiſe in a colde ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, the little heate is ſuffocate with groſſe meate, and the fine meates left rawe, for lacke of concoction, where if the fine meate be firſt taken moderately, it ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp and comforteth naturall heate, and maketh it more able to concoct groſſe meates, if they bee eaten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, ſo that it be but in ſmal quantitie, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as I lately affirmed one manner of meate is moſt ſure to euery complexion, foreſéene that it be alway moſt commonly in conformity of qualities with the perſon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eateth.

Hot wines and ſwéete, or confectioned with ſpices, or very ſtrong ale, or béere, are not conuenient at meales: for the meate is by them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupted then digeſted, and they make hot &amp; ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vapours aſcend vp to the braines. Albeit if the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke be very windie, or ſo cold and féeble, that it cannot concoct ſuch a quantitie of meate as is required to the ſufficient nouriſhment of the bodie of him that eateth, or hath eaten rawe hearbes or fruites, whereby he féeleth ſome annoyance, then may he drinke incontinent after his meale, a little quantitie of ſecke, or good <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> in ſmall ale: but if he haue much choler in his ſtomacke, or a head full of vapours, it were much better that he did neither drinke the one nor the other, but rather eate a little coliander ſéede prepared, or a péece of a Quince ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, or in Marmelade, and after reſt to amend the lacke of nature with ſléepe, moderate exerciſe, &amp; plaiſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding for comforting of the ſtomacke.

               <head>Of ſleepe and watch. CAP. 30.</head>
               <p>THe commoditie of moderate ſléepe appeareth by this, that naturall heat which is occupied about that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherof proceedeth nouriſhment, is comforted in the places of digeſtion, and ſo digeſtion is made better or more perfect by ſléepe, the body fatter, the minde more quiet and cléere, the humours temperate, and by much watch all things happen contrary.</p>
               <p>The moderation of ſléepe muſt be meaſured by health and ſickneſſe, by age, by time, by emptines or fulnes of the bodie, and by naturall complexions. Firſt to a hole man, hauing no debilitie of nature, and digeſting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the meat that he eateth, a little ſléepe is ſufficient: but to them which haue weake ſtomackes, and do digeſt ſlowly, it requireth that ſleepe bee much longer, ſembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly temperance is required in youth and age: winter and ſummer, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body being ful of ill humours, very little ſléep is ſufficient, except the humours be crude or raw, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſléepe neceſſarie, which digeſteth them better then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſemblably where the body is long empty, by long ſickneſſe, or abſtinence, ſléepe comforteth nature as wel
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11925:40"/>
in the principal members, as in all the other. Alſo regard muſt be had to the complexion, for they that are hot and doe eate little and digeſt quickly, a little ſléepe ſerueth, ſpecially to cholerike perſons, for in them much ſléepe augmenteth heate, more then is neceſſarie, whereby hot fumes &amp; inflammations are often ingendred, &amp; ſometime the naturall choler is aduſt or putrified, as experience teacheth. Fleumatike perſons are naturally inclined to ſléepe: &amp; becauſe they ingender much humours, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more ſléepe then ſanguine or cholerike. Perſons hauing natural melancholy, not procéeding of choler ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſt, do require very much ſléepe, which in them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth the powers animal, vital &amp; naturall, which ye may finde written in the tables preceding. Sléepe would be taken not immediatly after meales, &amp; before that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meat is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mouth of the ſtomack. For thereby is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred paines &amp; noiſe in the belly, and digeſtion corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; the ſléepe by ill vapours aſcending, made vnquiet &amp; troublous. Moreouer, immoderate ſléepe maketh the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die apt vnto palſies, apoplexies, falling ſicknes, rheumes and impoſtumes. Alſo it maketh the wits dull, &amp; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die flow and vnapt to honeſt exerciſe. Semblably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate watch drieth too much the body, and doth debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the powers animall, letteth digeſtion, and maketh the body apt to conſumption. Wherefore in theſe two things, as well as all other, a diligent temperance is to bee vſed, the moderation is beſt coniected (for it is hard perfectly to know it) by the ſenſible lightnes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſpecially of the braine, the browes, and the eyes, the paſſage downe of the meate from the ſtomacke, the will to make vrine, and to go to the ſtoole: contrariwiſe, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines in the body &amp; eyes, and ſauour of the meate before eaten, ſignifieth that the ſléepe was not ſufficient. They that are hole, muſt ſléepe firſt on the right ſide, becauſe the meate may approch to the liuer, which is in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack as fire vnder the pot, and by him is digeſted.</p>

This thing is ſo neceſſarie to the preſeruation of health, that without it, no man may be long without ſicknes: which is affirmed by <hi>Cornelius Celſus,</hi> ſaying, that ſluggiſhnes dulleth the bodie, labour doth ſtrengthen it: the firſt bringeth the incommodities of age ſhortly, the laſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man long time luſtie.

thereby perill might inſue by conueiance of them into al the members, before thoſe meates or humours be concoct or boyled ſufficiently. <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth, that the time moſt conuenient for exerciſe is, when both the firſt &amp; ſecond digeſtion is complete, as well in the ſtomacke, as in the veines, &amp; that the time approcheth to eate eftſoones. For if ye do exerciſe ſooner or later, ye ſhal either fill the body with crude humours, or els augment yellowe choler.

               <p>THe qualitie of exerciſe, is the diuerſitie thereof, for as much as therein be many differences in mouing, and alſo ſome exerciſe moueth more one part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, ſome an other. In difference of mouing ſome is ſlowe, or ſoft, ſome is ſwift or faſt, ſome is ſtrong or violent, ſome bée mixt with ſtrength or ſwiftnes. Strong or violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes be theſe, deluing, ſpecially in tough clay, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, bearing or ſuſtaining of heauie burthens, climbing or walking againſt a ſtéepe vpright hill, holding a rope, and climbing vp thereby, hanging by the hands on any thing aboue a mans reach, that his féete touch not the ground, ſtanding and holding vp, &amp; ſpreading the armes, with the hands faſt cloſed, and abiding ſo a long time. Alſo to holde the armes ſtedfaſt, cauſing an other man to aſſay to pull them out, and notwithſtanding hée kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his arme ſtedfaſt, inforcing thereunto the ſine wes and muſcules. Wraſtling alſo with the armes and legs: if the perſons bee equall in ſtrength, it doth exerciſe the one and the other: if the one be ſtronger, then is it to the weaker a more violent exerciſe. All theſe kinds of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and other like them, do augment ſtrength, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſerue onely for young men, which bee inclined, or be apt to the warres. Swift exerciſe without viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is running, playing with weapons, teniſe, or throwing of the ball, trotting a ſpace of ground forward, &amp; back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, going on the toes, and holding vp the hands. Alſo ſtirring vp and downe his armes, without plummets. Uehement exerciſe is compound of violent exerciſe, and ſwift, when they are ioyned together at one time, as daunſing of Galiardes, throwing of the ball, and running after it. Football play maye bee in the number thereof, throwing of the long Dart, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:11925:43"/>
continuing it many times, running in harneſſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like: the moderate exerciſe is long walking, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a iourney.</p>
               <p>The parts of the body haue ſundrie exerciſes appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pried vnto them, as running and going is moſt proper for the legges: mouing of the armes vp and downe, of ſtretching them out, and playing with weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſerueth moſt for the armes and ſhoulders, ſtooping and riſing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, as lifting great waights, taking vp plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, or other like poyſes on the endes of the ſtaues, and in likewiſe lifting vp in euery hand a ſpeare or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpike by the ends, ſpecially croſſing the hands, and to lay them downe againe in their places: theſe doe exerciſe the backe and loynes. Of the bulke and lungs, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exerciſe is mouing of the breath in ſinging and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The entrailes which be vnderneath the middreffe, be exerciſed by blowing either by conſtraint, or playing on ſhaulmes or ſackbots, or other like inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which doe require much winde.</p>
               <p>The muſcules are beſt exerciſed with holding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breath in a long time, ſo that he which doth exerciſe, hath well digeſted his meate, and is not troubled with much wind in his bodie. Finally, lowd reading, counterfaite bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, <note place="margin">Cel. 2.</note> teniſe, or throwing the ball, running, walking, and to ſhooting, which in mine opinion excéede all the other, doe exerciſe the body commodiouſly. Alway remember, that the ende of violent exerciſe is, difficultie in fetching of breath. Of moderate exerciſe, alteration of breath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or the beginning of ſweat.</p>
               <p>Moreouer in Winter, running and wraſtling is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. In Summer, wraſtling a little, but not run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. In very cold weather, much walking, in hot wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, reſt is more expedient. They which ſeeme to haue moyſt bodies, and liue in idlenes, they haue néede of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exerciſe.

For if it bee but in part, it is rather then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led temperance then abſtinence. It ought to be vſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after repletion, as the proper remedie therefore. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if it be moderate, it conſumeth ſuperfluities, &amp; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming them, it clarifieth the humors, maketh the body <note place="margin">Conſiderations in abſtinence.</note> fayre coloured, and not onely kéepeth out ſicknes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo where ſicknes is entred, nothing more helpeth it if it be vſed in ſeaſon. To them which haue very moiſt bodies hunger is right expedient, for it maketh them more drie, notwithſtanding there ought to be conſiderations in the meate before eaten, in the age of the perſon, in the time of the yeare, and in cuſtome. Firſt in the meat before eaten, if it be much in exceſſe, or very groſſe, or not much excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or light of digeſtion, and according therunto would abſtinence more or leſſe bee proportioned. Concerning <note place="margin">Aph. lib. 1.

As touching time, it muſt be remembred that in winter and ſpring time, the ſtomackes bee naturally very hot, and sléepe is long, and therefore in that time, meates would bée more aboundant, and although much bee ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, it will bee ſooner digeſted.

Bodies hot and moyſt, may eaſily ſuſtaine purgation by the ſtoole. They which be leanie or thinne, hauing the members tender, may take harme by purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To men that are cholerike, &amp; them that eat little, purgations are grieuous. In young children and olde men, it is daungerous to looſe much the belly. To them that are not wont to it, purgation is noyfull. He that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in a good order of diet, néedeth neither purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor vomit. After that the purgation hath wrought, thirſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſound ſléep, be ſignes that the bodie is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged.

               <head>Letting of bloud. CAP. 6.</head>
               <p>THe part of euacuation by letting of bloud, is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or cutting of the veine, wherby the bloud, which is cauſe of ſicknes or griefe to the hole body, or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part thereof doth moſt aptly paſſe.</p>
               <p>The commodities wherof being in a moderate quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, and in a due time taken, be theſe that follow: it cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth the wit, and maketh good memorie, it clenſeth the bladder, it drieth the braine, it warmeth the marow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bones, it openeth the hearing, it ſtoppeth teares, or droppings of the eyen, it taketh away lothſomnes, and confirmeth the ſtomacke, it nouriſheth that which is proper to nature, and the contrary expelleth. It is thought that thereby life is prolonged, and the matter making ſickneſſe, ſhortly conſumed. Wherefore let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of bloud is not onely expedient for them which are full of bloud, or haue abundance of ſtrength, but alſo for them, in whom without plenitude called fulnes, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations begin to be in their bodies, or by ſome outward ſtroake, the bloud being gathered within by collection thereof, doe féele griefe or diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo where there is much paine felt, or debilitie of ſome member, whereof is ſuppoſed to be ingendred ſome grieuous diſeaſe. Moreouer, they which vſe exceſſe of meates and drinkes, may bee cured by letting of bloud. But thoſe which be temperate, kéeping good diet, be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen without letting of bloud: as by fricaſies, vſing of bathes, exerciſe, walking, and riding moderatly. Alſo vnctions with oyles and oyntments called Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which by euaporation, doe ſhortly euacuate the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Albeit, if the fulnes be of melancholy bloud, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way néeds muſt be letting of bloud. Abundance of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy bloud is knowne by theſe ſignes. There is felt within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> entrales, or within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bulke of a man or woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a waightines with tenſion or thruſting outward, and al

that part which is aboue the nauell, is more heauie then it was wont to bee: alſo much vrine and fattie, the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or bottome thicke, troublous, inflammation and much paine. Theſe muſt be ſhortly let bloud, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy humour purged by ſiege. They which haue crude or raw humours, muſt be warily let bloud, before that ſickneſſe engender, but hauing the feuer in no wiſe. Concerning letting of bloud, theſe things following would be had in continuall remembrance, and bee afore <note place="margin">Aetius lib. 3.</note> thought on. In the abundance of the bloud, the qualitie and quantitie, the greatnes of the ſickneſſe, &amp; if it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or looked for. Alſo the diet preceding, the age and ſtrength of the perſon, the naturall fourme of his bodie, the time of the yeare, the region or countrie, the preſent ſtate of the ayre, the diſuſe of accuſtomed exerciſe, the ceaſing of euacuations vſed before. In qualitie, conſider of what humour the fulnes procéedeth. In quantitie, the abundance of that which is to be purged. In ſickneſſe, if it be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous or tolerable: if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſickneſſe be preſent, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the more diligence: if it bee looked for, it may bee the better proportioned. In diet, the cuſtome in eating &amp; drinking, muſt be ſpecially noted. In young men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men letting of bloud would be more liberall. In old men and yong children, it would be ſcarſer: ſtrong men muſt ſuſtain bléeding, they which are féeble may not indure it. Large bodies haue greater veſſels, then they which hée little. Leane men haue more bloud, corpulent men haue more fleſh. The time of the yeare muſt be ſpecially mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. For in the beginning of ſpring time it is beſt letting of bloud, as <hi>Oribaſius</hi> ſayth, and ſo doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue, after the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Arnold,</hi> vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that in Chriſtes manhood were all naturall powers. If he wil ſay, that yre is taken of courage, and in Chriſt it lacked not, whom both angels and deuilles trembled and feared. The premiſſes often reuolued, and born in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind, I will not ſay, ſhall vtterlie extinct all motions of wrath which is not poſſible, but it ſhall when it kindleth lightly repreſſe it, &amp; let that it ſhall not grow into flame. And in ſpeaking here of wrath, I doe not meane that which good

men haue againſt vices: or wiſe and diſcreet gouernours &amp; maſters, againſt the defaults or negligences of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects or ſeruants, vſed in rebuking them, or moderatly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them. For that is not properly yre, but rather to be called diſpleaſure, and is that whereof God ſpeaketh by his Prophet Dauid, ſaying, Be you angrie and do not ſin. And of that maner of anger hath bin diuers holy men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and other. And it appeared in Chriſt, when he draue out them which made their market in the holy temple of God, where there ought to be nothing but prayer. And in likewiſe when he rebuked the hypocrites. But if none of theſe things may come ſo ſhortly to his remembrance, that is moued with anger, at the leaſt, let him thinke on the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that <hi>Appollodorus</hi> the Philoſopher, taught to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Octanian,</hi> that before he ſpeake or doe any thing in anger, he doe recite in order, all the letters of the A.

This ſhall for this time ſuffice, for the remedies of yre: And hee that will knowe more of this matter, let him reade in my worke called the Gouernour, where I thereof do write more aboundantly.</p>

Now firſt I will declare ſome remedies againſt ſorrowfulnes of heart, concerning neceſſarie counſayle. Sometime this affect happeneth of ingratitude, either where for benefite, or ſpeciall loue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied, one receiueth damage, or is abandoned in his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, or is deceiued of him whom he truſted, or findeth him of whom he hath great expectation, forgetfull or negligent in his commodity, or perceiueth the perſon whom of long time he hath loued, to be eſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged from him, or to haue one of a later acquaintance in more eſtimation. This affection nippeth the heart, yea of moſt wiſe men, for they loue moſt hartilie, not prouoked by carnall affection, but rather by good opinion, ingendred by ſimilitude of honeſt ſtudies, and vertuous maners, of long time mutually experienced. And it is not onely vnto man grieuous, but alſo vnto God moſt diſpleaſant and odious, as it is aboundantly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſcripture. Wherefore the perſon which féeleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe touched with this affect, before that it groweth into a paſſion, &amp; waxeth a ſicknes, let him call to remembrance theſe articles following, or at the leaſt wiſe, ſome of them. For euery ech of them may eaſe him, though perchaunce they cannot forthwith perfectly cure him. Conſider, that <note place="margin">

it ceaſe not to grieue thée, confer the ingratitude that doth vex thée, with that in gratitude which was ſhewed by the Iſraelites, whom God choſe for his own people, deliuered from ſeruage, ſhewed for them wonders, preſerued them fortie yeares in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſert, deſtroied for them kings, gaue to them the countrie which flowed with milke and hony, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them againſt all outward hoſtilitie, ſent vnto them ſuch abundance of riches, that ſiluer was in Jeruſalem, as ſtones in the ſtréet, and his tabernacle, and afterward his moſt holy temple among them, which he did daily viſite, with his diuine maieſtie, made their kings to raigne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and ſpake with their Prophets familiarly, &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their errors moſt gently, and yet for all this, they imbracing the Paynimes Idolatrie, they left ſo gracious and louing a Lord, and liuing God, &amp; to his great deſpite, gaue diuine honours to calues of braſſe, and other mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Images, and at the laſt, put to moſt cruell death, the onely ſonne of God, that had done ſo much for them. And if we Chriſtian men doe looke well on our ſelues, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluing the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable benefit, which we haue receiued by Chriſts paſſion, and conſider the circumſtance of his moſt excellent patience, and moſt ſeruent loue towards vs, with our forgetfulnes, and the daily breach of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which we made at our Baptiſme, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferring our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vnkindnes thereunto, there ſhall appeare no ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that ſhould offend vs. Finally for a concluſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold well about thée, and thou ſhalt all day find the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ingrate to their parents, &amp; wiues to their huſbands. And wilt thou looke that thy benefit or vaine expectation, ſhould make thée more frée from ingratitude of thy frend, whom chance hath ſent thée, then nature may the parents to their children, or the coniunction of bodies by lawfull mariage, take vnkindnes from the wiues toward the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands?

               <p>The loſſe of goods or authoritie, doe grieue none but fooles, which do not marke diligently, that like as neither <note place="margin">Loſſe of goods.</note> the one nor the other doth alway happen to them that are worthie, ſo we haue in daily experience, that they fal from him ſuddenly, who in increaſing or kéeping them, ſeemeth moſt buſie.

               <p>MElancholie is of two ſorts, the one is called naturall, which is onely cold and drie, the other is called aduſt or burned: naturall melancholy is, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth, the reſidence or dregges of the bloud: and therefore is colder and thicker then the bloud. Melancholy aduſt is in foure kinds, either it is of naturall melancholy aduſt, or of the more pure part of the bloud aduſt, or of choler aduſt, or of ſalt fleum aduſt. But of al other that melancholy is worſt, which is ingendred of choler, finally all aduſt melancholy annoieth the wit and iudgement of man: For when that humor is het, it maketh men mad, and when it is extinct, it maketh men fooles, forgetfull and dull. The natural me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy kept in his temperance, profiteth much to true iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wit, but yet if it be too thick, it darkneth the ſpirits, maketh one timorous, and the wit dull: if it be mixt with fleame, it mortifieth the bloode with too much colde, wherefore it may not bee ſo little, that the bloud and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites in their feruentneſſe, be as it were vnbridled, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doe happen vnſtableneſſe of witte, and ſlipper remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, nor yet ſo much that by the waight thereof (for it is heauie approching night to the earth) that wée ſéeme to be alwaye in ſleepe, and neede a ſpurre to pricke vs forward. Wherefore it is right expedient to keepe that humour as thinne as nature will ſuffer it, and not to haue too much of it. But now to the dyet pertaining to them, whom this humoure annoyeth. The knowledge that melancholie raineth is oftentimes heauines of minde, or feare without cauſe, ſléepines in the members, many cramps without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion

The meates conuenient are they, which bee temperately in heate, but ſpecially they that be moyſt meats ſoon digeſted, and they rather boyled then roſted, temperatly mixt with ſpice, milk hot from the vdder, or latemilked, is very conuenient for that complexion, ſweet almonds blanched, &amp; almond milk, the yolke of reere egges, and finally all things which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender pure bloude, and all that is written in the chapter of age, all theſe bee ill for them: wine thicke or troublous, ſpecially red wine, meates hard, dry, very ſalt, or ſowre, burned meate, fryed meat, much béefe, beares fleſh, beans, rocket, colewortes, muſtard, radiſh, garlike, except there be much wind in the body, for then it is very holſome, ony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, léekes, finally all things which heateth too much, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth too much, or drieth too much, alſo wrath, feare, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſorrow, much ſtudy, or care, much idlenes or reſt, all thing that is grieuous to ſée, to ſmell or to heare, but moſt ſpecially darkenes.</p>

It is to be diligently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that where melancholy happeneth of choler aduſt, there meates which bee hot in working would bee wiſely tempered, and drinking of hot wines would be eſchewed, ſemblably cautele would bee in ſauours, notwithſtanding moderate vſe of ſmall wines cléere and well verdured, is herein very commendable, the humor thereby being clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the ſpirites clenſed, but the abuſe or exceſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, doth as much domage.</p>

               <head>Of diſtillations called commonly rheumes, and of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt them right neceſſary. CAP. 2.</head>
               <p>FOr as much as at this preſent time in this Realme of Englande, there is not any one more annoyance to the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:11925:63"/>
health of mans bodie, then diſtillations from the head cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led rheumes, I will not let to write ſome what of them, wherby men may take benefit if they will, although ſome Phiſitions more conſidering their market, then their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to God and their countrie, will be neuer ſo much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with mine honeſt enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>Diſtillation is a dropping downe of a liquid matter out of the head, and falling either into the mouth, or into the noſethrils, or into the eyes, and ſometime into the chéekes and eares: that which falleth into the mouth is receiued of the throte, into that part which is the inſtrument of the voyce, which at the firſt maketh hoarſenes, &amp; in proceſſe of time maketh the voyce little, and vnneth to be heard. And if the rheume be ſharpe, it raiſeth the inward ſkinne of the throte, &amp; ſometime in doth exulcerate the lungs. If it doth fall into the ſtomacke, the rheume being a cold, it altereth the bodie into a cold diſtemperance: if he be hot, it maketh a hot diſtemperature, &amp; doth ſome what exulcerate in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, and at the beginning abateth appetite, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth feeble concoction. The cold rheume maketh concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſlow, and alſo cruditie, and ingendreth foure fumes in the mouth. If it be corrupted, it turneth alſo nouriſhment vnto corruption, which maketh vpbrayding fumiſh or ſharpe, or of ſome ill qualitie, which cannot be expreſſed: if the matter do deſcend lower, it tormenteth the guts called ieiunium, and colon, &amp; toucheth other veſſels from whence procéedeth digeſtion: in this diſcraſie two things are to be prouided for: firſt to let that the rheume doe not diſtill into the ſayd places: or if it hath done, that it be ſhortly expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from them. Firſt, to let that it ſhall not diſtill, it ſhalbe neceſſary to eate ſome meate the ſooner in the morning, if there hath not preceded repletion. Where the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all the bodie is cholerike, and the ſtomack is weak, the ſtomack would be made ſtrong with ſuch things as of their property do comfort the ſtomack: foreſéene that they be moderatly cold and moyſt. And that which is alreadie fallen into the ſtomacke, muſt be expelled with vomite or

ſiege, prouoked with wormewood, ſtéeped all one day and a night in a little ſmall white wine, or ſmall ale or ſtale, which haue vertue onely to wipe away the filth from the ſtomacke: but if it be ſucked déep into the filmes of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, then is it better to take the medicine called Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picra, either in powder with drink warmed, or els in pils, to the number of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And they which be ſo affect or diſeaſed, muſt take ſuch things as may diſſolue the fleume, and clenſe the ſtomacke without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, of the which vertue we know Oximel to bee of. If the ſtomacke and head bee both diſtempered with cold, then muſt bee vſed meates, drinkes and oyntments, which onely be hot, and vtterly to forbeare all that is cold. By theſe diſtillations or rheumes, happeneth many other grienous diſeaſes, beſides thoſe whereof I haue ſpoken, as in the head whirlings, called in Latin <hi>Vertigines,</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſwoundings, falling ſickneſſe, poſes, ſtinking of the noſe, called Polipus, ſores in the mouth, toothach, pin and webbe in the eyes, dulnes in hearing, ſquinces, fretting of the bowels, with flixes, ſhortnes of breath, griefe in the heart, palſies, ach in the muſcules and ioynts: wherefore it is not be neglected. And I doe much maruaile that our Phiſitions doe not more ſtudiouſly prouide therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. I my ſelfe was by the ſpace of foure yeares conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in this diſcraſie, and was counſailed by diuers Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to kéepe my head warme, and to vſe Diatrion pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perion, and ſuch other hot things, as I haue rehearſed: at the laſt, féeling my ſelfe very féeble, and lacking appetite and ſléepe, as I happened to reade the booke of <hi>Galen, De temperamentis,</hi> which treateth <hi>De inequali temperatura,</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:11925:64"/>
and afterward the ſixt booke, <hi>De tuenda ſanitate,</hi> I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that I had béen long in an errour. Wherefore firſt I did throw away my quilted cap, &amp; my other cloſe bonets, and onely did lye in thinne coyfe, which I haue euer ſince vſed both winter and ſummer, and ware a light bonet of veluet onely, then made I Oximell after the doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi> ſauing that I boyled in vineger rootes of parſly and Fenell, with Endiue, Cicorie, and Betany, and after that I had taken it 3. daies continually, euery day 3. ſpoonefuls in the morning warme: then tooke I of the ſame Oximell, wherein I had infuſed and ſtéeped one dramme of Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, &amp; halfe a dramme of fine Reubarbe, the ſpace of thrée daies and thrée nights, which I receiued in the morning, eating no meat ſixe houres after, and that but a little broth of a boyled henne, whereof inſued eight ſtooles abundant of choler and fleume: ſoone after I ſlept ſoundly, and had good appetite to eate. After ſupper I would either eate a few Coriander ſeedes prepared, or ſwallow downe a little fine Maſtix, and forbare wine, and dranke onely ale, and that but little, ſtale and alſo warmed. And ſometime in the morning would take a perfume of Storax calamita, and now and then I would put into my noſethrilles either a leafe of gréene Lawrell, or Betany, or water of Marier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> bruſed, which cauſed the humor to diſtill by my noſethrils. And if I lacked Storax, I tooke for a perfume the rindes of old Roſemary, and burned them, and held my mouth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the fume, cloſing mine eyes: afterward to comfort my ſtomacke and make it ſtrong, ſometime I would eate with my meate a little white pepper groſſe bruſed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>Galens</hi> electuary made of the iuyce of Quinces, called Diacidonion, ſometime marmalade of quinces, or a quince roſted. And by this diet, I thank almightie God, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely be giuen all glorie, I was reduced into a better ſtate in my ſtomacke and head, then I was ſixtéene yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as it may appeare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue long knowne mée. And this haue I not written for vaine glorie, or of preſumption, but to the intent that they which haue
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:11925:65"/>
their bodies in like te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pexature as mine was, that is to ſay, being cholerike of complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and hauing rheumes falling out of a hot head, may if they liſt aſſay mine experience, or in the ſtéed of my ſayd infuſion, take Hierapicra, with ale or water to purge them, whereof ſhall not inſue ſo much peril, as of corrupted ſyrupes, and other confections called Magiſtrates, made with old rottendrugs, though the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions be neuer ſo well learned. In bodies of other tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, I would not that mine experience ſhould be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but with diſcretion, tempering the medicine, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the ſtomack and head doe require, remembring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that hot rheumes be thin &amp; ſubtil, cold rheumes be for the moſt part thick. And that they which be thin, would be made thicke, that they pierce not ſo faſt. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which be thicke, would be made thin, that they may the ſooner be purged. Finally, this dare I affirme, that the rheumes, which of late time haue béen more frequent in this realme, then they were wont to be fortie yeares paſſed, haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened of none occaſion more ſhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of banquetings after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and drinking much, ſpecially wine a little after ſléepe. Another thing is the kéeping the head too hot or too lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, whereby the braine, which is naturally colde, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered with hot vapours aſcending from the ſtomack, thoſe ſame vapours being let to euaporate, or paſſe foorth out of the head, and therefore be concreate or gathered into a humor ſuperfluous, which ſtilleth downeſtſoones out of the head into the places before rehearſed. Yet now a daies if a boy of 7. yeares of age, or a young man of 20. yeares, haue not two caps on his head, he &amp; his friends will think that he may not continue in health. And if the inner cap be not of veluet, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Firſt, the cauſe of the rheume muſt be digeſted, after expulſed, thirdly diuerted, that is to ſay, turned from the eyen or throte into the noſe, from whence it may bee more eaſily purged. Fourthly, it may be ſtopped that it ſhall not diſtill. In hot diſtillations the head is very hot, in féeling the rheume being in the mouth, he is thin and warme, the tongue or chéekes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bliſtered, the face ſometime redder then it is accuſtomed to be, ſomtime a burning within the noſe. To them which haue this hot rheume, may be giuen the ſeed of white Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, Diacodion made of the heads of white Popie &amp; raine water. Amylum with milke, if there be no feuer, penides, mallowes, orage, gourdes, and ſpinage, boyled and eaten with oyle of Almonds, ſyrupe of violets, nenuphar, or the wine of ſwéete pomegranates, the water of a great Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber, boyled with a little ſugar being dronke, doth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate choler, ſtoppeth the rheume, and eaſily looſeth the belly: the ſeedes of Millons brayed in a morter with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; ſtrained with ſoft bread, hauing ſugar put to it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an excellent good meate againſt the hot rheumes:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11925:66"/>
plaiſters made of barly bruſed, violets, popie and Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill boyled in water, wherein ſpunges or linnen clothes be dipt, ſhould bee layed on the head, and the genitories or legges therewith waſhed. If the ſicke man cannot ſléepe, then the ſayd parts with the belly and fundament ſhall be annoynted with the oyles of Uiolets and Nenuphar, the ſauour of Camphar in Roſewater with violets, is good in that caſe. <hi>Galen</hi> exhorteth, and I haue proued, that in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot rheume, which hath ſtilled faſt, the powring of cold water vpon ones head, had ſtinted the rheume. He that is therin diſeaſed, muſt eſchew going in the ſunne, or to come nigh a great fire, or to ſtand, or be lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g couered, or to weare much on his head, he muſt reſt much, and prouoke himſelfe to ſléepe a night, but not very long, and to lye on the one ſide on a hard bed, hauing his head high: alſo rubbing of his legges before meales, is very holeſome. Cold rheumes bee perceiued by coldneſſe of the humour and head, with palenes of the viſage, all cold things increaſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rheume. Theſe things are good againſt it, the detection of Cicer with hony and raiſins, filberd nuttes toſted, and eaten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meales: nothing is more holeſome then abſtinence, ſpecially in the euening: they which haue it, muſt beware of Northerne windes, the Mooneſhine by night, waſhing in cold water, and to bee long bareheaded. The ſeedes of Nigella a little toſted, and put into a péece of thin Sarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and ſmelled vnto, ſtoppeth the rheumes.</p>
                  <p>Néefing in the beginning of rheume, is diſpraiſed of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> but after that the matter is digeſted, it is very hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: that may bée made with leaues of Lawrell, or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie put into the noſethrils, the iuyce of Coleworts, the rootes of red Béetes, water of Marioram. A pretie medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for that purpoſe proued. The iuyce of young Béetes and Marioram, of each one ounce, good white wine eight ounces, Saffron the weight of two pence, that being het and taken in the mouth, ſhall be drawne vp with breath to the place, whereby the diſtillations falleth out of the noſe into the mouth. And if the rheume do diſtill into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cheekes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:11925:66"/>
and téeth, I haue proued, that the iuyce of grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Juy, and that hearbe which wee call Mouſe-eare, taken within a quill into the noſethrils, oftentimes purgeth excéedingly the rheumes, and taketh away the ach of the téeth.</p>

                  <p>For compaſſion which I haue of them that bee vexed with toothach cauſed of rheumes, I will by the leaue of Phiſitions, conclude this chapter with an excellent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine againſt the ſayd paſſion, which is written of an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Phiſition of late yeres, which medicine alſo maketh the téeth faſt which be looſe, and alſo ſtoppeth the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bléeding of the gummes, where with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breath is made vnſauery. Take the rindes of Caper rootes, the rootes of brambles, which doe beare blacke berries, the flowers of Pomegrants called balauſtia, of euery of them the waight of two duckets, Pelitorie of Spame one ducket, ſeede of white Henbane, the rinds of Mandrage, of euery of them one ducket and a halfe, Spourge of the garden one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Alome of the rock two duckets: boyle al theſe in white wine or claret, which is very rough in taſte, and ſtraine it therewith, and let the patient ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times waſh his mouth.

               <p>NOw to returne eftſoones to ſpeake of dyet, it is to be remembred, that they which are readie to fall into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, they are prepared thereunto either by repletion or ſuperfluous humours or elſe by cruditie, or malice of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which are in them. As touching the firſt, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dyet muſt bée ſuch, as thereby the humours may bée attenuate, and by conuenient euacuation, brought to a moderate quantitie.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond muſt bee corrected with meates and drinkes of contrary qualities, hauing alway reſpect to the age of the perſon, time of the yeare, place of habitation, and moſt ſpecially the vniuerſall complexion. For choler offending in an old man, in winter time in a cold country, or the perſon being of his naturall complexion, fleumatick or melancholy, would not bee ſo aboundantly expulſed or ſubdued, as if it bee in one young and luſtie, in the hotte ſommer, in the countries where the Sunne feruently bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, or the perſon of his proper nature is very cholericke.</p>
               <p>And in likewiſe contrary. Wherfore euery man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his owne naturall complexion, with the qualitie of the humour that offendeth, let him make temperance his chief cooke, and remembring that which I haue before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ordaine to himſelfe ſuch dyet, as may reforme the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence with none or little annoyance to his vniuerſall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.

               <p>WE will now deuide the body of man into foure parts, the head, the bulke called in Latine <hi>Thorax,</hi> which contayneth the breaſt, the ſides, the ſtomack and intrailes. The belly, called in latine <hi>Venter,</hi> containeth the paunch and bowels. Alſo the bladder called in latine <hi>Veſica,</hi> in the which name, is alſo contayned the conduits by the which vrine paſſeth. When any diſeaſe approcheth to the head, theſe tokens do commonly precede, ſwimming in the head, headache, heauines of the browes, ſounding in the eares, pricking in the temples, the eies in the morning doe water or waxe dim, the ſmelling is dull, the gummes doe ſwell.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:11925:72"/>
When thou féeleſt ſuch tokens, forthwith purge the head with ſomewhat, not with vehement medicines, but taking Iſope or organum, &amp; the crops of them boyle with white or claret wine halfe a pint, and therewith gargariſe your mouth faſting, vntil the fleum be purged out of your head: this is the eaſieſt medicine in diſeaſes of the head.</p>
               <p>It is alſo very holeſome to gargariſe the mouth &amp; breaſt with hony water, whereunto muſtard is put and mingled, but firſt the head muſt be rubbed with a warme cloth, that the fleum may eaſily come out of the head. And if theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens be neglected, theſe maner of ſickneſſes do follow ſoon after, bleared eies and humours letting the ſight, cleftes in the eares, ſwellinges in the necke full of matter called the kings euill, corruption of the braines, poſes or rheumes, heauines of the head, and toothache. When the bulke is like to ſuffer any ſicknes, it is perceiued by theſe tokens, all the bodie is in a ſweat, the ſpittle is either ſalt or bitter, or cholerick, the ſides and ſhoulders doe ake without any occaſion, the pacient gapeth often, alſo there doth happen much waking, ſuffocations or lacke of breath, thirſt after ſléepe, the mind is vexed with heauines, alſo the breaſt and armes are very cold, and the hands doe tremble. Againſt theſe things, thie remedy may be prouided. After a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſupper aſſay to vomite without any medicine, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite is alſo profitable, which meate doth follow. He that in ſuch wiſe wil vomit, let him eat haſtily ſmal radiſh roots, townkerſes, roket, ſenuy, or purſlaine, and drinke after it a great quantity of warme water, and prouoke himſelfe to vomit. He that ſetteth little by the ſaid tokens, let him fear theſe ſickeneſſes following, the plureſie, the ſicknes of the lungs, melancholie or madnes, ſharp feuers, the lethargie, inflamation with yexing. If any ſickeneſſe bee towarde the belly, they may be eſpied by theſe tokens, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> belly is firſt wrapped together, and in it ſelfe is troubled, all meates and drinkes doe ſéeme bitter in taſte, he féeleth heauines in his knéees, a ſtifnes in his loynes, and wearines in all his body, without any occaſion, a ſléepines in his legs, with a

All theſe doe expell the ordure of the bellie: but if anie of the ſayd ſignes, doe more and more increaſe, the licour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſéed of Carthamus called alſo Cnicus is boyled, is a pleaſant ſure medicine, ſmall cole wortes boyled in a good quantitie of water, the licoure thereof in meaſure two pintes, ſauing the third part of a pint with honie and ſalte being dronken, ſhall profite much. Cicer &amp; the pulſe called in latine <hi>Eruum,</hi> in engliſh (I ſuppoſe) chits in water, dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k faſting hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame effect.

Hemerhoydes, aking of ioynts. When the bladder is towarde any ſickeneſſe, it is perceiued by theſe tokens, fulnes felt after little meat, breaking winde downewarde and vpwarde, paleneſſe of colour in all the body, heauie or troublous ſleepes, the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine pale and paſſing foorth painefully, ſwelling about the coddes, &amp; priuy members. When theſe tokens appeare, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is expedient to haue remedye of odoriferous thinges, which doe expell vrine, which ſhall bée done without any perill, with the rootes of fenell and parcely ſtéeped one or two daies in good white wine, and to drinke thereof fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting euery morning thrée ou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces and two drams, with the water of wilde Carets or Elicampane, which of theſe is nexte at hande, euery of them haue like effect.

Alſo the pilles called co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly <hi>Pillulae raſis</hi> (but in déed they were inuented by Rufus) are very excellent, ſpecially if the aloe, which is in it bee waſhed, and thereunto added a little <hi>Bolus amenus &amp; Terra ſagillata.</hi> And if the perſon bée of hot complexion, a quantitie of ſorell ſeede, and red coral, this confectionated with ſyrope of cytrons in colde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, or to olde men with white wine, vſe them euery third daye, one pill at a time, three houres or foure afore dinner or ſupper.

A piece of the roote of a ſettuall, borne in the mouth, preſerueth from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. In like wiſe doth ſorell chewed faſting, and the iuyce ſucked downe. To poore men, <hi>Marcilius</hi> was wonte to giue a toſte of bread ſtéeped in vineger, with a piece of an Onion, or Rue.

that there is no better preſeruatiue, then ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Moreouer receiue not into your houſe any ſtuffe, that commeth out of a houſe wherein any perſon hath bin infected. For it hath béene ſéene, that ſuch ſtuffe lying in a coffer faſt ſhut by the ſpace of two yeares, after that cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hath beene opened, they which haue ſtoode nigh to it haue beene infected, and ſome after haue dyed. But here I alway except the power of God, which is wonderfull, and alſo mercifull, aboue mans reaſon, or counſaile, preſeruing or ſtriking whome, when, and where it ſhall like his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie: to whom be glory and praiſe euerlaſting.

               <p>Thus make I an end of this treatiſe, deſiring them that ſhall take profite thereby, to defend it againſt enuious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, on whom I haue ſet the aduenture for the loue that I beare to my countrie, requiring all honeſt Phiſitions to remember, that the intent of my labour was, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and women reading this worke, and obſeruing the counſayles therein, ſhould adapt thereby their bodies to receiue more ſure remedie, by the medicines prepared by good Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in dangerous ſickneſſes, they kéeping good diet and enforming diligently the ſame phiſitions of the manner of their affects, paſſions, and ſenſible tokens.

Thus fare ye wel gentle readers, and forget me not with your good report, and pray to God that I bee neuer worſe occupied.</p>
