            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THAT it is extremely to our griefe and aſtoniſhment, that M. <hi>Lilburn</hi> a Free-man of England, and Free Citizen of London, ſhould be ſuffered by you to be ſo violently purſued for his life upon an Act of the late Parliament, which not one of you but knows in your own conſciences to be moſt unjuſt, bloody, and tyrannical, and againſt the very end and tenour of the Truſts of Parliaments, and in deſtruction and ſubverſion of our fundamentall and indubitable native Rights and Freedoms: It being hardly credible, but that we know it, that you have not been prevailed withall to declare the ſame null and void in Law, by the many juſt, rational, earneſt, and legal Petitions hither to preſented unto you.</p>
            <p>You no ſooner ſate, but you voted your ſelves the Parliament of the Common wealth of England; notwithſtanding you all know you wanted the legal, formal election from the people, due to that Truſt. What was it then, that induced you ſo to Vote, and afterwards to declare your ſelves ſo to be? Certainly, if any thing juſtly moved you thereunto, it was your reall purpoſe, that the Juſtice, life, and power of a Parliament of the Common-wealth of Englaand ſhould be viſible amongſt you, and acted by you; and that you intended to do the proper works of a true Parliament, which without doubt, are to deliver the Captive, and ſet the Oppreſſed free; and being ſo, what greater proof can you give, either more agreeable to the known L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w of the Land, or more acceptable to all true Lovers of the ancient Liberties of the Nation, then to deliver M. <hi>Lilburn</hi> out of this ſnare causleſsly laid, purpoſely to intrap his life?</p>
            <p>You ſee by thoſe many Addreſſes of the people to you on his behalf, that they are ſenſible, as we are, that what is done unto him, may be done (at the luſts, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and pleaſures of men in power) unto every man, and that the common liberry hath been, and is highly violated in this uniuſt and moſt unparallel'd cruelty towards him.</p>
            <p>You ſee alſo, that waving the manner of your Election to the Parliamentary Authority, that they nevertheleſs owned you, in hopes to find the life and power of a true Parliament amongſt you, a condeſcention in them very much deſerving your higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and moſt zealous reſolutions to anſwer their iuſt and ſober expectations, and to grant their iuſt deſires concerning Mr. <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burns</hi> ſafety, which every one diſcerneth to be iuſt; and wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exceedingly at your deferring there of, Principally, if not onely by your iuſt and righteous works, you can be known to be a Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, part of whoſe works you do, in repeoling that bloody and inſnaring, and not in the leaſt to be ſpoken or pleaded for unjuſt Act; and in reſtoring him to his eſtate and freedom, &amp;c. When upon any reſpects you decline ſuch works, you decline your owne being: and when you ceaſe from doing of them, do you not ceaſe alſo from being a Parliament. Conſider we beſeech you, Is it not a rule that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceive, <hi>His you are, whoſe works you do;</hi> the cruelty you ſuffer to be done unto him, being in your power, and duty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, in the ſight of God and Man you do it, and are gilty of it. O therefore fear the Almighty God before the mightieſt of men, and couragiously do this and the Nations work, deliver this captive, and ſet this oppreſsed man M. Lilburn free from all his trouble and causleſs hazards of death.</p>
            <p>And ſhould ſuch a Jury be found (more like Devils then Chriſtians) that ſhould find him guilty of Felony upon ſo vile a By-Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (without any the leaſt act of Felony at the Common-Law laid to his charge) a thing ſo contrary to the true Law of England; how know you, but your power of pardon may be reſtrained by his potent adverſaries, and his death haſtned before you can redeem it, as it hath already been threatned? the court and place of his trial having been terrified and frightned already with a party of Horſe. No, we beſeech you to be perſwaded, though by us the youngeſt and weakeſt of men, who yet may live, and prove to be, as we heartily deſire, a Seed-plot and Nurſery of preſervers to you and yours, and our native and juſt fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal rights, not to defer to grant theſe our humble and but juſt deſires ſo much as one moment, but vouchſafe us the favour as to be the immediate meſſengers to him of your juſt reſpects, and his deliverance from his moſt unjuſt captivity.</p>
            <closer>And we ſhall ever pray, &amp;c.</closer>
