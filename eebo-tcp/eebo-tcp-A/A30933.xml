            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSCENDENT VIRTUE Of the true <hi>SPIRIT of SALT.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere have been ſo many falſe preparations of that, commonly called, <hi>The Spirit of Salt,</hi> retaining moſt pernicious accidents, as it will be a hard matter to have the worth of that which is perfect admitted into a vulgar Creed. Yet when the noble and univerſall qualities of ſeaſoning and preſerving our Food by common Salt are weighed, the ingenious muſt needs conclude, that when ſeparated from its dregs and ſcum, and preſented to us in its ſtrength and vigour, it cannot but be worth a welcome reception amongſt modern intelligent perſons, as well as it had amongſt many of the learned Ancients.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as <hi>Baſilius Valentinus, Paracelſus, Helmont,</hi> and many others moſt excellent Chymiſts, have wrote in the commendation thereof, it may well be hop'd, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blication of three or four hundred perſons freſh experiences of its virtue in ſome particular caſes, ſhould not be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the publick good, who are ready to teſtifie the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45917:3"/>
truth of theſe Aſſertions following, againſt all oppoſers and objections. And indeed, its of ſo inherent an excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that it needs neither Epiſtle Dedicatory, or Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory: but that this famous City and Kingdome ſhould not be ignorant of ſo great a mercy, its inward and outward virtues muſt not be conceal'd.</p>

All ſorts of Liquors, are the Conveyes thereof; as Water, Beer, Ale, Syder, Wine, Broths, Sawces, &amp;c. more healthfully uſed than Oranges, Lemons, Vinegar, or Verges; and with Oyl is moſt pleaſant: Indeed its proper in all ſorts of Cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to be uſed by the healthy, to prevent theſe Maladies, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Treatiſe of its Nature, as well, as for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; and that ſo much, as gives the Pallate a ſmart Relliſh, at the diſcretion of the Uſer: No Error can be committed, by taking any quantity from 10 drops to 40, at any time, mingled with Sugar, may be doubled; and taken in a Mornings-Draught, is very Efficatious: For it preſerves not onely the Body, but whatever it receives, from all manner of Corruption, by Reſtoring Nature to its Primitive State.</p>
            <p>In PARTICULAR. 20 Drops of this Spirit in half a Pint of any ſort of Liquor, is a good Standard: And after the proportion of 60 Drops in a Quart, it revives all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45917:6"/>
ſorts of Beer, Ale, Syder, and Wine; long preſerving them both Strong and Generous: And the like quantity being put into Barrels of Water, for Marriners to drink at Sea, it will be better Preſerved, have a gratefuller Taſte, and avoid that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction which ariſeth from Raw Water; eſpecially prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Worms and Scurvy. And ſo alſo for preſerving Meat in long Voyages, 40 Drops hereof mingled with a Pint of Water, and ſo proportionably covering the Meat, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Weight, and make it wholſom.</p>
            <p>In dreſſing all ſorts of Fiſh, Fleſh, and Fowl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being old and Tough, they are made Tender and nouriſhing, by ſo much hereof mingled with any Spices, Water, or Butter, and ſprinkled on them, as may give a quick taſte in their Sauces; and any cold Meat alſo ſprinkled therewith, is preſerved from detriment: And to make a harſh tender amongſt the curious Pallates, diſſolving a little <hi>Argall</hi> with this, and ſome <hi>SALT.</hi> makes moſt dainty wholſom food.</p>
            <p>In Pickling any Sallets, as Cucumbers, Capers, Fennell, Purſlain, Broom-buds, &amp;c. being mingled with Water, and Salt, ſo as to make it ſharp and quick, is very healthily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
            <p>To prevent the Toothach, to cleanſe and preſerve the Teeth white, Put 6 Drops in a ſpoonful of running Water, (or for the Curious into Roſe-water) and with a ſmall Linnen-Ragg, rub the Teeth, and its impoſſible they ſhould cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or putrifie: It cleanſeth them from their Corroſive Gravel.</p>
            <p>As for WOMEN, in moſt caſes its fit to give private directions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But for ſuch as give ſuck, let them, with 60 Drops turn a Pint of Milk into a Poſſet, and take the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45917:6"/>
Whey, mingled with Sugar (if they pleaſe) and drink a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable draught thereof in a Morning, faſting an hour after it, and their Children will be kept thereby from the Scurvy, ſmall Pox, Feavers, Convulſions, and the like Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>In CHILDREN. Who deſire to prevent the <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Gravel,</hi> which (by Experience) deſtroys them, as well as others (who are not capable to take other Medecines, by reaſon of the Nauſeouſneſs and great quantities) may give them of this ſort of Poſſet drink, and they will find it both preſerving, and cleanſing thoſe parts of the Body ſubject to theſe Afflictions, and alſo promiſe good Naturall Reſt to them.</p>
            <p>In want of Water, a Drop or two of this mingled with Sugar put on the Tongue, will refreſh the Pallate, and quench Thirſt. Wherefore to avoid the hazard of Glaſſes breaking, it ſhall be Compoſ'd alſo into a BALSOMICK SALT, Portable in any Box, Purſs, or Paper; which will not onely accomodate the Rich, (who travel with Coach and Horſes at their eaſe) but alſo the Poor, and Infantry of Armies; who travelling on foot in the heat of Summer, are often forc'd to drink Puddle-water, wherein Filth and Carryon lye, by which, they are ſubjected to Surfeits, and ſuch other Diſeaſes as make them dye like Flies.</p>
            <p>Almoſt infinite other Advantages; As preſerving dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies intire, &amp;c. are hidden in this <hi>Spirit;</hi> which in ſucceſs of time, by Gods grace ſhall be manifeſted: And if any deſire more exact inſtructions in their particular Caſes, they may repair where its made, and be more fully directed.</p>
            <p>But if any Perſons of Honour, or Quality, do more eſteem this <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>SALT,</hi> prepar'd ſweet, and ſeparated from all its ſharpneſs, they may be pleaſured with it, freed from any

Flegmatick Quality, being prepared from the pure Eſſence of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of a Learned, famous <hi>Grecian,</hi> who hath travelled moſt parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd the ſame: And being recommended from both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, is now entertained in a Laboratory, whence ſeveral other <hi>Chymical</hi> preparations, for the good of this Kingdom, its hoped ere long, ſhall appear.</p>
