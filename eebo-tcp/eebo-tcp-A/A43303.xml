         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <head type="sub">(Now lying before this Honourable Houſe, for Eight Millions of Money, by laying a Duty on BEDS) Anſwered, with ſome <hi>REMARKS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <label>OBjection,</label> That there are not Five Beds to a Houſe one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt fall ſhort.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſwered,</label> That Five Beds to each Houſe, one with another, is as near a Calculation as can be made, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out poſitive proof; and there being allowod in the ſaid Propoſals above one third part of the Kingdom to pay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (as being deemed poor) then computing the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 800000 Houſes mentioned in the ſaid Propoſals, which are more large. Now, if ſome of them have but 2, 3, or 4 Beds to a Houſe, yet it muſt be granted, that abundance have 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, or more, ſo there can be no great miſtake in the Calculation.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Object.</label> That this Duty will fall heavy upon thoſe Perſons that depend upon Lodgers, and they ought to be excuſed as well as Inn-keepers (which are propoſed to pay no more for their Beds then what their Family uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> Were all private Houſes as lyable to quarter Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as Inns, it might be reaſonable; but having Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to accept or refuſe what Lodgers they pleaſe, there is more reaſon they ſhould pay; becauſe they receive profit by their Beds, when others that muſt pay make no benefit by Lodgings.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Object.</label> This Duty will fall hard upon Day-Labourers, that have a great charge of Children, and conſequently many Beds.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> This is a material Objection, and eaſily anſwered, for this Honourable Houſe may except thoſe Perſons, or charge them as they ſhall ſee ſit.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Object.</label> That to take the Number of Beds in the Kingdom, will occaſion Officers to come into Peoples Houſes, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be indured.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> It is not intended, but the Maſter or Miſtreſs of the Houſe, to give in their own account of their Beds, to ſuch Officers that will come to their doors for that purpoſe: And if any ſuch Perſon give in a falſe Account, then to forfeit — for each Bed concealed; whereby it may be ſuppoſed, no Perſon will bazard the forfeiture of — for wronging the King of Seven or Eight Shillings.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>REMARKS.</head>
               <p>This Duty may be ſuppoſed to reach the Abilities of Men, and may be charged according to Quality; and ſo make it a more equal Tax then any heretofore has been.</p>
               <p>This Duty muſt be allowed to be as good and certain a Fond as can be found out, being the moſt general and neceſſary Commodity in <hi>England,</hi> for no Man but would lye upon a Bed or Quilt at Night; and it cannot be ſuppoſed, that any Perſon would lye without it, on purpoſe to defraud the King of the Duty.</p>
               <p>It is Humbly Conceived, That this Duty will amount to ſo great a Sum that the Land might be excuſed this Year; but if it be thought neceſſary not wholly to depend upon this, by reaſon it may be uncertain, then if <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the Land pay 2 s. in the pound, (which would make one Million) the Beds would make Six millions more, allowing Two Millions to fall ſhort in the Calculation.</p>
               <p>This Duty, and that upon Land, may be Collected by <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
