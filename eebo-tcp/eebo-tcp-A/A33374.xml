            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An exact account of the Cruel Oppreſſions
and Perſaecutions of the French Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</head>
            <p>THE Cruelties exercis'd of late on the Proteſtants
in <hi>France,</hi> do appear ſo deteſtable to all, who have
not diveſted themſelves of Humanity, that no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Authors of them uſe their utmoſt endeavours
to leſſen what they cannot conceal. Were not this
worſe than barbarous uſage, a project of a long contrivance, a
Man might for Charity's ſake, ſuppoſe this their palliating it,
to be an acknowledgment of their own diſpleaſure at it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
their boldneſs is inexcuſable, who ſhall endeavour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
on the World in matters known; not by <hi>Gazetts,</hi> and
News-letters, but by an infinite number of Fugitives of all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
who have nothing left but Tears and Miſeries to bring
along with them into foreign Nations. 'Tis certainly too bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
to oppreſs innocent People in their own Countrey; and
afterwards to ſtifle their complaints in other places where they
are driven; and by this means deprive them of a compaſſion
which the bare inſtincts of nature never refuſe to the miſerable.
Yet this is the courſe our perſecutors of <hi>France</hi> have held; their
cruelty muſt be attended with Impoſtures, that the miſchiefs
which they have acted may paſs undiſcovered.</p>
            <p>I think we ſhould be much to blame, if we ſuffer them to
go on in this ſecond deſign, as they have done in the firſt; and
therefore we ſhall chooſe ſome principal inſtances, whereon we
ſhall make ſuch reflections, as thereby to judge with greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and exactneſs on the whole proceeding. And as we ſhall
offer nothing but what ſhall be perfectly true; ſo we ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
nothing in our reflections, but what all the world of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
people will allow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61156:3"/>
To begin with matters of Fact: There's no body but knows,
that a while after his preſent Majeſty of <hi>France</hi> came to the
Crown, there aroſe in the Kingdom a Civil War; which proved
ſo ſharp and deſperate, as brought the State within an hairs
breadth of utter ruine. 'Tis alſo known, that in the midſt of
all theſe troubles, thoſe of the Reformed Religion kept their
Loyalty in ſo inviolable a manner, and attended it with ſuch a
Zeal and extraordinary fervour, that the King found himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to give publick marks of it, by a Declaration made at St.
<hi>Germains,</hi> in the year 1652. Then as well at Court, as in the
Field, each ſtrove to proclaim loudeſt the deſerts of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts;
and the Queen Mother her ſelf readily acknowledged,
That they had preſerved the State: This is known by all, but
'twill hardly be believed, though it be too true, what our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
themſelves an hundred times told us; and which the ſequel
has but too ſhrewdly confirmed, that this was preciſely the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
and moſt eſſential cauſe of our ruine; and of all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
which we have ſince ſuffered. Endeavours were uſed to
envenom all theſe important Services in the Kings and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
minds, by perſwading them, that if in this occaſion, this
party could conſerve the State; this ſhewed, they could likewiſe
overthrow it, ſhould they have ranked themſelves on the other
ſide; and might ſtill do it, when ſuch alike occaſion ſhould offer
it ſelf. That therefore this party muſt be ſuppreſſed, and the
good they have done no longer regarded; but as an indication
of the miſchief, which they may one day be capable of doing.
This Diabolical reaſoning, <hi>which hinders Subjects from ſerving
their Prince,</hi> to avoid drawing on themſelves chaſtiſements, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of recompences, was reliſh'd as a piece of moſt refined
Policy. For as ſoon as the Kingdom was ſettled in Peace, the
deſign was advanced of deſtroying the Reformiſts; and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to make them comprehend that their Zeal had ruined them,
the Cities which had ſhewed moſt of it, were firſt begun with.
Immediately then, on ſlight pretences, they fell on <hi>Rochel, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taubon,</hi>
and <hi>Milan;</hi> three Towns, where thoſe of the Reformed
Religion had moſt ſignalized themſelves for the intereſts of the
Court; <hi>Rochel</hi> underwent an infinite number of preſcriptions,
<hi>Montaubon</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> were ſackt by the Soldiers. But theſe
being but particular ſtroaks and meer preludes, which decided
nothing, they tarried not long before they made appear the great
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61156:3"/>
and general Machius, they were to uſe in the carrying on of their
intended deſign to the laſt extremity. 'Twill be a difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to give an exact account of theſe ſeveral methods: For never
humane malice produced ſuch multiplicity of them; every day
brought forth new ones for twenty years together. To take only
notice of the chief of them; which were, Firſt, Law Suits in
Courts of Juſtice. Secondly, Deprivations from all kinds of
Offices and Employs; and in general, of all ways of ſubſiſtance.
Thirdly, The infraction of Edicts, under the notion of Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of them. Fourthly, New Laws and Orders. Fifthly, Juggles
and amuſing Tricks. Sixthly, The animating of People, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring
them with hatred againſt us. Theſe are the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
means, which the perſecuters have employed to attain
their ends, during ſeveral years; I ſay, during ſeveral years;
for what they deſigned, being no eaſie matter, they needed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
time, to order their Engins; not to take notice of their
Traverſes and Interruptions by forrain Wars; yet whoſe ſucceſs
have not a little contributed to encreaſe their Courage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
them in the deſign which they had againſt us.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe means has had an infinite extent. We ſhould
begin with the recital of all the Condemnations of Churches,
or ſuppreſſions of exerciſes of Religion, and all the other vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which have hapned by the eſtabliſhing of Commiſſaries;
this was a Snare dexterouſly laid immediately after the Treaty
of the <hi>Picenees,</hi> the King under pretence of repairing the Edict
of <hi>Nants,</hi> ſent them in the Provinces. The Roman Catholic
Commiſſary was every where his Majeſties Intendant; who was
beſure a fit man for the purpoſe, armed with the Royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and who was well inſtructed in the ſecret Aim. The other,
was either ſome hungry Officer, a Slave to the Court, or ſome
poor Gentleman, who had uſually neither Intelligence requiſite
in theſe ſort of Affairs, nor the liberty of ſpeaking his Sentiments.
The Clergy had ſet them up; He was their Ambulatory Spirit.
The Syndicks were received before them as formal parties in
all our Affairs; the aſſignations were given in their name, the
Proſecutions alſo; and as well the Diſcords of the Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as the Appeals from their Ordinances, muſt be finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
in the Kings Council.</p>
            <p>Thus in general, all the rights of the Churches, for the exerciſes
of Religion, the burying places, and all ſuch dependancies, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61156:4"/>
into a review, and conſequently expoſed to the freſh purſuits of
the Clergy, and the ill intention of the Judges. In which there was
not the leaſt dram of Equity; for the Edict having bin once
executed, according to the intention of him that made it, there
needed no ſecond touches; it being moreover, wholly unlikely
thoſe of the reformed Religion, who had bin ever in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
the ſuffering party, could uſurp any thing therein; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
its limits beyond what belong'd to them. But there were
other deſigns in hand than the providing againſt the Contraven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and therefore by this order, the greateſt part of the
Churches cited for the juſtifying of their Rights, ſaw themſelves
ſoon condemned one after another, by Decrees of Council, how
good and ſufficient ſoever their Titles and Defences were.
Scarcely paſſed a Week, wherein theſe kind of Decrees were
not made; and if it hapned, that the Modeſty of the Judges
ſaved any of them, by the great evidence of their Right, as this
ſometimes hapned; beſides that, the number was ſmall, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of thoſe condemned, the Judges often received order to
condemn them, when they ſhewed they could not in Conſcience
do it.</p>
            <p>But the Oppreſſions of this kind, did not terminate in the bare
condemnation of Churches; for particular Perſons had their
part. In ordinary and civil Affairs, where the matter concerned
a piece of Land, perhaps, a Houſe, a Debt between a Roman
Catholick and a Perſon of our Religion; Religion was to be ſure
always one of the chief Heads of the Accuſation; The Monks,
the Emiſſaries, the Confeſſors, and all the whole Tribe of that
Crew, intereſſed themſelves in the Affair. In Courts of Juſtice,
all the cry was, <hi>I plead againſt an Heretick, I have to do with a
Man of a Religion odious to the State; and which the King would
have extirpated.</hi> By this means, there was no longer any Juſtice
to be expected, few Judges were proof againſt this falſe Zeal,
for fear of drawing the Fury of the whole Cabal againſt him, or
paſſing for a favourer of Hereticks. 'Tis not to be imagined
how many unjuſt Sentences theſe ſort of Prejudices have given,
in all the Courts of the Kingdom; and how many mens Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
have bin ruined by them: When any one complained, the
Anſwer was ready, <hi>You have the remedy in your own hands; why
do you not turn Catholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet all this had bin nothing, had the Perſecution kept here,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61156:4"/>
and not proceeded to faſten on the Reputation, the Liberty, and
even the very Lives of Perſons, by a general inundation (as a
man may term it) of criminal Proceſſes. Writings were Printed
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſent from thence to all Cities and Pariſhes of the
Kingdom, which impowred the Curates, Churchwardens and
others, to make an exact enquiry into whatſoever the pretended
Reformiſts might have done, or ſaid for twenty years paſt, as
well on the ſubject of Religion as otherwiſe, to make Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this before the Juſtices of the Place; and puniſh them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remiſſion. So have we ſeen for ſeveral years, in execution of
theſe Orders, the Priſons every where fill'd with theſe kind of
Criminals; neither were falſe Witneſſes lacking; and that which
was moſt horrible, was, that though the Judges were convinced
they were Knights of the Poſt, yet they maintained them, and
carry'd them throw ſuch Points, as they knew to be untrue. They
condemned innocent and vertuous Perſons to be whipt, to the
Gallies, to baniſhment and publick Penances. And if a Spark
of Honor or Conſcience, at any time hindred them, yet there
was always at leaſt an impunity for the falſe Witneſs.</p>
            <p>This kind of Perſecution fell chiefly on the Miniſters; for of a
long time they might not Preach, without having for Auditors, or
to ſpeak better, Obſervators, a Troop of Prieſts, Monks and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries,
and ſuch kind of People, who made no ſcruple to charge
them with things, which they not ſo much as thought of; and
turn others into a contrary meaning. They alſo went ſo far as to
devine the Thoughts, to make Crimes; for as ſoon as ever any
Miniſter ſpake of <hi>Egypt, Pharaoh,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> of good or bad
People, (as 'tis difficult not to ſpeak of theſe matters, when they
explained the Scripture) Theſe Spies never failed to report, that
by <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the wicked, they meant the Catholicks, and by the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the pretended Reformiſts. The Judges concerned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in this, and what is moſt ſtrange, the miniſters of State them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
reſpected theſe Interpretations of thoughts, as evident Proofs.
On theſe grounds, the Magiſtrates filled the Priſons whith theſe
kind of poor People, keeping them therein for whole years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and often inflicted on them ſeveral corporal Penalties.</p>
            <p>'Tis already ſeen by this firſt kind of Perſecution, what were
the Uſages ſhewed in <hi>France</hi> to the Reformiſts before they came
to the utmoſt violence. But we ſhall ſee them appear more, in
what we have to add, touching the privation of Offices and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61156:5"/>
and in general, of the means of gaining a Livelihood;
which is the ſecond way we mentioned, that has been uſed to
effect our Ruine. 'Tis not hard to comprehend, that in a great
Kingdom, as <hi>France</hi> is, where the Proteſtants were diſperſed
over all parts, there were an infinite number, who could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
nor maintain their Families, but by the liberty of ſerving the
publick, either in Offices, Arts, Trades, or Faculties, each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Calling. <hi>Henry</hi> the great, was ſo well convinced
of the neceſſity and Juſtice of this, that he made it an expreſs
Article, the moſt diſtinct perhaps and formal, of all contained in
his Edict: And therefore 'twas here the Perſecutors thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
obliged to uſe their utmoſt endeavours. In this regard,
they began with the Arts and Trades; which under ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
they rendered almoſt inacceſſible to the Proteſtants, by the
difficulties of arriving to the maſterſhip of them, and by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
Expences, they muſt be at to be received therein, there
being no candidate, but was forced for this purpoſe to maintain
Law Suits, under the weight of which, they for the moſt part
fell, not being able to hold them out. But this not being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
by a Declaration made in 1669. they were reduced to one
third, in the Towns where the Proteſtants were more in number
than the other Inhabitants; and they were forbidden to receive
any therein till this diminution was made, which at one ſtroke
excluded all the pretenders.</p>
            <p>Some time after they abſolutely drove all the Reformiſts from
the Conſulſhips, and all other Municipal Officers of the Cities,
which was in effect the depriving them of the Knowledg of their
Proper Affairs, and Intereſts, to inveſt wholly the Catholics
with them.</p>
            <p>In 1680. the King iſſued out an Order, which deprived them
in general of all kind of Offices and Employs, from the greateſt
to the ſmalleſt: They were made incapable ſo much as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
any Employ in the Cuſtom-Houſes, Guard, Treaſury, or
Poſt-Offices; to be Meſſengers, Coach-Men, or Waggoners, or
any thing of this nature.</p>
            <p>In the year 1681. by a Decree of Council, all Notaries, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneys,
Solicitors, and Sergeants, making Profeſſion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion, were rendered uncapable throughout all the
Kingdom. A Year after, all Lords and Gentlemen of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion were ordered to diſcharge their Officers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61156:5"/>
of the ſaid Religion, and not make uſe of them in any caſe,
without other reaſon than that of their Religion.</p>
            <p>In 1683. all Officers belonging to the Kings Houſhold, and
thoſe of the Princes of the Blood, were alſo rendred uncapable
of holding their Places. The Councellors and other Officers of
<hi>Ayds,</hi> and Chambers of accounts, and thoſe of Seneſchalſhip,
Baily wicks, and Royalties, Admiralry, Provoſtſhips, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal's
Courts, Treaſury Exciſe, and others, who belonged to the
Toll-Offices, and ſuch like buſineſſes, were ordered to leave their
Places in favour of the Catholicks.</p>
            <p>In 1684. all Secretaries belonging to the King and Great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of <hi>France,</hi> as well Titulary, as Honorary ones, and their
Widows, were deprived by a Revocation of all their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of what nature ſoever they were. They alſo deprived all
thoſe that had purchaſed any Priviledges for the exerciſing of any
Profeſſions, as Merchants, Surgeons, Apothecaries, and Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
nd all others, without exception.</p>
            <p>Nay, they proceeded to this exceſs, that they would not ſuffer
any Midwives of the Reformed Religion to do their Office, and
expreſly ordained for the future, our Wives ſhould receive no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
in that Condition, but from <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. 'Tis
not to be expreſt how many particular Perſons and Families they
reduced every where, by theſe ſtrange and unheard of Methods,
to Ruine and Miſery. But becauſe there were yet many which
could ſuſtain themſelves; other Methods of Oppreſſion muſt be
invented: To this end they iſſued out an Edict from the Council,
by which the new Converts, as they call them, were diſcharged
from any payments of their Debts for three years. This, for the
moſt part, fell on the Reformiſts, who, having had a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Tye of Intereſt and Affair with theſe pretended Converts,
becauſe of their Communion of Religion, were reckoned amongſt
their Chief Creditors: By this Order they had found the ſecret
to recompenſe thoſe that changed, at the charge of thoſe who
continued firm: and this they did likewiſe by another way; for
they diſcharged the Converts of all the Debts, which thoſe of
the Religion had contracted in common, which by conſequence
fell on the reſt. Add to this, the prohibition to fell or alienate
their Eſtates, on any Pretence whatever, the King annulling and
breaking all Contracts, and other acts relating to that matter:
if it did not appear, that after theſe Acts, they had ſtayed in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61156:6"/>
Kingdom a whole Year: ſo that the laſt Remedy of helping
themſelves with their Eſtates in extream Neceſſity, was taken
from them. They deprived them likewiſe of another, which
ſeemed the only one remaining, which was, to ſeek their Bread
elſewhere, by retiring into other Countries, there to get their
Living by Labour, ſince this was not permitted them in <hi>France.</hi>
By repeated Edicts the King forbad them to leave his Kingdom,
on ſevere Penalties, which drove them to the laſt Deſpair; ſince
they ſaw themſelves reduced to the horrible neceſſity of dying
with Hunger in their own Countrey, without daring to go to live
elſewhere. But the Cruelty of their Enemies ſtopt not here,
for there yet remained ſome Gleanings in the Provinces, though
very few, and as thin as thoſe in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dream. The Intendants
in their Diſtricts had order to load the Reformed with Taxes,
which they did, either by laying upon them the Tax of the New
Catholicks, who were diſcharged thereof on favour of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
or by laying exorbitant Taxes, which they called Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that is to ſay, he who in the ordinary Roll was aſſeſſed at
Forty or Fifty Livers, was charged by this Impoſtion at Seven
or Eight Hundred. Thus had they nothing more left, for all was
a Prey to the Rigour of the Intendants. They raiſed their Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
by the effectual quartering of Dragoons, or Impriſonment,
from whence they were not freed till they had paid the utmoſt
Farthing.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the two firſt Engins or Machins which the Clergy
made uſe of againſt us: To which they added a Third, which we
have termed the Infractions of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Explication. Thoſe who would know their Number
and Quality, need only read the Books written and publiſhed
on this Subject; as well by the Jeſuite <hi>Menier,</hi> an Author Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for his Illuſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as by one <hi>Beanard,</hi> an Officer in the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
Court of <hi>Beſier</hi> in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> There you will find all the
turns, which the meaneſt and moſt unworthy Sophiſtry could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
to elude the cleareſt Texts of the Edict, and to corrupt the
Sincerity thereof. But becauſe we do here give you only a brief
Account of our, Troubles, we will content our ſelves with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
ſome of the Principal, iſſuing from this Fountain: What
was there, for Example, more clear and unqueſtionable in the
Edict than this; <hi>viz.</hi> That 'twas given with an Intention to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thoſe of the Religion, in all the Rights that Nature and Civil
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61156:6"/>
Society give to Men. Yet in 1681. there came out an Edict, that
Children might at the Age of Seven Years, abjure the Reformed
Religion, and embrace the Catholick, under pretence, that the
Edict did not preciſely mark, that at this Age they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
at their Parents Diſpoſal. Who ſees not that this was a
meer trick, ſeing that on one hand, the Edict forbad to take the
Children from their Parents by force, or fair means: and on the
other hand, the Edict ſuppoſed and confirmed all the Natural
Rights, of which, without Controverſie, this is one of the
moſt inviolable. Was there ever a more manifeſt Infraction of
the Edict, than that, which forbad thoſe of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
who had paſſed over to the <hi>Roman,</hi> to return to that they
had left, under pretence, that the Edict did not formally give
them in expreſs Terms this Liberty. For when the Edict permits
generally all the Kings Subjects Liberty of Conſcience, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
the perplexing and troubling them, and offering any thing
contrary to this Liberty. Who ſees not that this Exception,
touching the pretended Relapſers, is ſo far from being an Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Edict, that 'tis a notable violation of it.</p>
            <p>Whereunto we may add the charge given to the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
not to change their Religion, and embrace the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For when the Edict gives Liberty of Conſcience, it does it in
proper Terms, for all thoſe, who are, and ſhall be of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Yet if we believe the Clergy, this was not <hi>Henry</hi> the
Great's meaning, intending only to grant it to thoſe, who made
Profeſſion of it, at the time of the making his Edict. That of
<hi>Nantes</hi> gave alſo to the Reformed, the priviledges of keeping
ſmall Schools in all places, where they had the Exerciſe of their
Religion, and by this Term of ſmall or little Schools, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the common explication, thoſe were always underſtood,
where one might teach Latin and Humanity. This is the Sence,
which has been ever given in all the Kingdom, to this Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is ſtill given when it concerns the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks.
Yet by a new Interpreation, this permiſſion was reſtrained to
the bare Liberty of teaching to read, and write, as if the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
were unworthy to learn any more; and this on purpoſe, to
tire out the Parents, and drive them to this extremity, either
not to know what to do with their Children, or be forced to
ſend them to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks for Education.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61156:7"/>
The Edict gave them the liberty in all places where they had
Churches, to inſtruct publickly their Children, and others, in
what concerns Religion, which viſibly eſtabliſht the Right of
teaching them Theology, ſeeing their Theology is nothing elſe
but this Religion. And as to Colleges, wherein they might be
inſtructed in Liberal Sciences, the Edict promiſed Letters Pattents
in good form. Yet 'twas ſuppoſed the Edict gave no right to the
Reformed to inſtruct them in Theology, nor to have Colleges,
and on this Suppoſition, three Academies were condemned, all
that remained. That of <hi>Sedan,</hi> although grounded on a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Edict, was ſuppreſt as the reſt, and even before them.</p>
            <p>But we muſt go further, and ſeeing we have undertaken, to
ſhew in this Abridgment, the principal things they have done to
exerciſe our Patience, before they came to the utmoſt Fury. We
are not to paſs over the new Orders, or new Laws, which were
to us as ſo many new Inventions to torment us. The firſt of theſe
Orders, which appeared, was touching the manner of Buryals,
and entering the Dead. The number of Attendants were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to thirty Perſons in thoſe places where the Exerciſe of our
Religion was actually eſtabliſhed, and to ten where it was not.
Orders were alſo iſſued out to hinder the Communication of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
with one another, by Circulary Letters, or otherwiſe;
though about matters of Alms and diſpoſal of Charity. Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were likewiſe made of holding Colloquies in the Interval of
Synods, excepting in two Caſes, the providing for Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
by the Deaths of their Miniſters; and the Correction of
ſome Scandals. They likewiſe took away from thoſe places, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the Edict, which they call'd <hi>Exerciſes de fief,</hi> all the
Marks of the Temples, as the Bell, the Pulpit, and other things
of this Nature. They were likewiſe forbidden to receive their
Miniſters in Synods to have any deciding Voice there, or to note
them in the Catalogue of thoſe that belong'd to Churches. Others
forbad the ſinging of Pſalms in private Houſes, as alſo ſome that
commanded them to ceaſe ſinging even in their Temples when
the Sacrament paſſed by, or at the time of any Proceſſion. Others
were made to hinder Marriages, ſuch times as were forbidden
by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. Others forbad Miniſters to Preach any
where, except in the place of their uſual Reſidence. Others for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
their ſetling in places, unleſs ſent by the <hi>Synods,</hi> though the
Conſiſtories had call'd them thither according to their uſual forms.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61156:7"/>
Others were made to hinder the Synods from ſending to any
Churches more Miniſters than were there in the preceding Synod.
Others, to hinder thoſe that deſign'd for the Miniſtry, to be edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in Foreign Univerſities. Others baniſh'd all Foreign Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
though they had been ordained in the Kingdom, and ſpent
there the greateſt part of their Lives. Others forbad Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
or Cardinals for the Miniſtry to reſide in places where
Preaching was forbidden, or nearer than ſix Miles of them.
Others forbad the People to aſſemble in the Temples, under
pretence of Praying, Reading, or Singing of Pſalms, except in
the Preſence of a Miniſter, placed there by the Synod. One ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
one was made to take away all the Backs of the Seats in
the Churches, and reduce them all to an exact Uniformity. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to hinder the Churches that were a little more Rich, to aſſiſt
the Weaker, for the maintenance of their Miniſters, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities.
Another to oblige Parents to give their Children, who
changed their Religion, great Penſions. Another to forbid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
betwixt Parties of different Religions, even in the caſe of
Scandalous Cohabitation. Another to prohibit thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
from that time, to entertain in their Houſes any Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
or Servants that were Roman Catholicks. Another which
made them uncapable of being Tutors or Guardians; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
put all the Minors, whoſe Fathers dyed in the Profeſſion
of the Proteſtant Religion, under the Power and Education of
Roman Catholicks. Another forbidding Miniſters and Elders
to hinder any of their Flock, either directly or indirectly, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Roman Religion, or to diſſuade them form it. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forbidding <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> to embrace the Reformed
Religion; and the Miniſters either to inſtruct or receive them into
it. Another ſubjecting Synods to receive ſuch Roman Catholick
Commiſſaries as ſhould be ſent them from the King, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
order to do nothing, but in their preſence. Another for
bidding the Conſiſtories to aſſemble oftner than once in Fifteen
days, and in preſence of a Catholick Commiſſary. Another for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
Conſiſtories to aſſiſt, on pretence of Charity to the Poor
Sick Perſons of their Religion; and ordaining that the Sick
ſhould be carried into their Hoſpitals, ſtrictly forbidding any
Man to entertain them in their Houſes. Another confiſcating, in
favour of Hoſpitals, all the Lands, Rents, and other Profits of
what nature ſoever, which might have appertained to a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61156:8"/>
Church. Another forbidding Miniſters to come nearer than
Three Leagues to the place where the Priviledges of Preaching
was in queſtion or debate. Another confiſcated to the Hoſpitals
all the Revenues and Rents ſet apart for the maintenance of the
Poor, even in ſuch Churches as were yet ſtanding. Another
ſubjecting ſick and dying Perſons to the neceſſity of receiving
Viſits, ſometimes from Judges, Commiſſionaries, or Church-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens;
ſometimes of Curates, Monks, Miſſionaries, or other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks,
to induce them to change their Religion, or require
of them expreſs Declarations concerning it. Another forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Parents to ſend their Children before ſixteen years of Age
to travel in Forreign Countries, on any pretence whatſoever.
Another prohibiting Lords or Gentlemen to continue the exerciſe
of Religion in their Houſes, unleſs they had firſt produced their
Titles before the Commiſſaries, and obtained from them a Licenſe
to have Preaching. Another which reſtrained the right of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a Miniſter to thoſe only, who were in Poſſeſſion of their
Lands ever ſince the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> in a direct or collateral
Line. Another which forbad Churches called <hi>Baillage,</hi> to receive
into their Temples any of another Bailywick. Another which
enjoined Phyſitians, Apothecaries, and Chirurgeons, to advertiſe
the Curates or Magiſtrates of the condition of Sick <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
that the Magiſtrates or Curates might viſit them. But amongſt
all theſe new Laws, thoſe which have moſt ſerved the Deſign
and Intention of the Clergy, have been on one hand, the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of receiving into their Temples any of thoſe who had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their Religion, nor their Children, nor any <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick
of what Age, Sex, or Condition ſoe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, under pain of forfeiting
their Churches, and the Miniſters doing publick Pennance, with
Baniſhment and Confiſcation of their Eſtates; and on the other
fide, the ſetting up in all the Temples a particular Bench for the
Catholicks to ſit on; for by this means, as ſoon as any one reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to change his Religion, they needed only to make him do it
in private, and to find him the next Morning in the Temple, to
be obſerved there by the Catholicks, who were in their Seat.
Immediately Informations were made, and afterwards Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
in all the Rigour of the Law. The <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks
needed only to enter into the Temple, under pretence, that they
had a place there, and then they ſlipt in amongſt the Croud, and
immediately this was a Contravention to the Declaration, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61156:8"/>
an unavoidable Condemnation. 'Tis by this means they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
an infinite number of Temples and Churches, and put
into Irons a great number of Innocent Miniſters; for Villains
and falſe Witneſſes were not wanting in this occaſion.</p>
            <p>All theſe Proceedings were ſo violent, that they muſt needs
make a ſtrong Impreſſion in the Reformiſts Minds, whereunto
theſe things tended. And in effect, there were many of them,
that bethought themſelves of their ſafety, by leaving the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
ſome tranſported themſelves into one Kingdom, and ſome
into another, according as their Inclinations led them. But this
was what the Court never intended, for more than one reaſon;
and therefore to hinder them, they renewed from time to time
this Decree, which we have mentioned, which ſtrictly prohibited,
under the moſt ſevere Penalties, any to depart the Kingdom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leave; and to this end they ſtrictly guarded all Paſſages on the
Frontiers. But theſe Precautions did not anſwer their Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and 'twas better to blind the People, by hopes of abating
this rigorous uſage at home; and to this end in 1669. the King
revoked ſeveral violent Decrees, which produced the Effect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
For though the Judicious ſaw well enough, that this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
ſprang not from a good Principle, and that, in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel,
the ſame Decrees would be put in execution, yet the moſt
part imagined they would ſtill confine themſelves within ſome
Bounds in our regard, and that they would not paſs to a total De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>We have often drawn the ſame Concluſions from the ſeveral
Verbal Declarations, which came many times from the Kings own
Mouth, that he pretended not to indulge us, but he would do us
perfect Juſtice, and let us enjoy the benefits of the Edicts in their
whole extent, that he would be very glad to ſee all his Subjects
re-united to the Catholick Religion, and would for the effecting
this, contribute all his Power, but there ſhould be no Bloud ſhed,
during his Reign, on this account, nor any violence exerciſed.
Theſe preciſe and re-iterated Declarations, gave us hopes the King
would not forget them; and eſpecially in eſſential matters, he
would let us enjoy the effects of his Bounty and Equity. 'Twas
the more expected by a Letter, he wrote to the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi>
the Copies of which the Miniſters of State took care to
diſperſe through the whole Kingdom. His Majeſty aſſured him,
that he was well ſatisfyed with the Behaviour of his <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61156:9"/>
Subjects, from whence he drew this natural Concluſion, that he
intended not then to deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>To which we may add the managements uſed ſometimes in the
Council, where Churches were conſerved, at the ſame time
when others were crdered to be demoliſh'd; to make the World
believe, they obſerved meaſures of Juſtice, and that thoſe which
they condemned, were not grounded on good Titles. Sometimes
they ſoftned ſeveral too rigorous Decrees; other times they
ſeemed not to approve of the violences offered by the Intendants
and Magiſtrates; even to the giving of orders to moderate them.
In this manner did they hinder the execution of a Decree made
in the Parliament of <hi>Rouen,</hi> which enjoyned thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion to fall on their Knees, when they met the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
Thus did they ſtop the proſecutions of a puny Judge
of <hi>Charenton,</hi> who ordered us to ſtrike out of our Liturgy a prayer
which was compoſed for the faithful, that groaned under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of Antichriſt. 'Tis thus alſo, that they did not extreamly
favour another Perſecution which began to come general in the
Kingdom againſt the Miniſters, under pretence of obliging them
to take an Oath of Allegiance, wherein other Clauſes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,
contrary to what Miniſters owe to their Charges and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
'Twas thus alſo they ſuſpended the execution of ſome
Edicts, which themſelves had procured, as well to Tax the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
as to oblige them to reſide preciſely in the place where
they exerciſed their Miniſtry. With the ſame deſign the Syndic's
of the Clergy, had the Art to let the principal Churches of the
Kingdom to be at reſt, for many years without diſturbance in their
Aſſemblies; whilſt they in the mean time, deſolated all thoſe in
the Country. They ſuſpended alſo the condemnation of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
and reſerved them for the laſt. It was alſo in this view,
that at Court, the firſt ſeemed unable to belive, and at laſt not
to approve of the exceſſes, which one <hi>Marillac</hi> an Intendant of
<hi>Poitu,</hi> committed in his Province: A man poor and cruel, more
fit to prey on the High-ways, than to be Intendant of a Province;
though indeed they had a clauſe expreſly to make theſe Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But amongſt all theſe illuſions, there's none more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
than five or ſix, which will not be improper here to take
notice of: The firſt was, That at the very time, when at the
Court they iſſued out all the Decrees, Declarations, and Edicts,
which we have ſpoken of here before, and which they cauſed to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61156:9"/>
be put in execution with the greateſt rigour, at the ſame time,
that they interdicted their Churches, demoliſhed their Temples,
deprived particular perſons of their Offices and Employments,
reduced People to Poverty and Hunger, impriſoned them, loaded
them with Fines, baniſh'd them, and in a word, ravag'd almoſt all;
the Intendants, Governours, Magiſtrates, and other Officers in <hi>Paris,</hi>
and over all the Kingdom, coolly and gravely gave out, the King
had not the leaſt intention to touch the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> but
would moſt Religiouſly obſerve it. The ſecond was, that in the
ſame Edict, which the King publiſh'd to forbid Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
to embrace the Reformed Religion, which was in the year
1682. That is to ſay, at a time when they had already greatly
advanced the work of our deſtruction; they cauſed a formal
Clauſe to be inſerted in theſe terms, <hi>That he confirmed the Edict
of</hi> Nantes, <hi>as much as it was or ſhould be needful.</hi> The third, That
in the Circular Letters which the King wrote to the Biſhops and
Intendants, to oblige them to ſignifie the Paſtoral Advertiſement
of the Clergy to our Conſiſtories, he tells them in expreſs terms,
<hi>That his intention was not that they ſhould do any thing that might
attempt upon what had been granted to thoſe of the Reformed Religion,
by the Edicts and Declarations made in their favour.</hi> The fourth,
That by an expreſs Declaration publiſh'd about the latter end of
the year 1684. the King ordained, That Miniſters ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the ſame Church, above the ſpace of three years, nor
return to the firſt, within the ſpace of Twelve; and that they
ſhould be thus tranſlated from Church to Church, at leaſt twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Leagues diſtant from the other; ſuppoſing by a manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
that his deſign was yet to permit the exerciſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to the Miniſters in the Kingdom for Twelve years at leaſt.
Though indeed they at that moment deſign'd the Revocation of
the Edict, and had reſolved it in the Council. The fifth conſiſts in a
Requeſt preſented to the King, by the Aſſembly of the Clergy
at the ſame time, that they were drawing an Edict to revoke
that of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and put into the Hands of the <hi>Procurer</hi> General
to frame it; and in the Decree which was granted on this requeſt,
the Clergy complain'd of the miſrepreſentations which the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
are wont to make of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to which they
attribute Doctrines which they do not hold, and beſeech his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to provide againſt it. And alſo expreſly declared, that they
did not yet deſire the Revocation of the Edict, upon which the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61156:10"/>
King by his Decree expreſly forbad the Miniſters to ſpeak either
good or hurt, directly or indirectly of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in
their Sermons; ſuppoſing, as every one may ſee, that 'twas his
Intention ſtill to let them Preach; were ever ſuch illuſions
known! But was there ever any greater than this which they put
in the very Edict we ſpeak of? The King after having cancelled
and annul'd the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and all that depended thereon,
after having interdicted for ever all publick Religious Exerciſes,
he alſo for ever baniſh'd all the Miniſters from his Kingdom, and
expreſly declares, that his will is, that his other Subjects, who
are not willing to change their Religion, may remain where they
are in all Liberty, enjoy their Eſtates, and live with the ſame
Freedom as heretofore, without any moleſtation on pretence of
their Religion, till it ſhall pleaſe God to enlighten and convert
them. Theſe were Amuſements and Snares to entrap them, as
it has ſince appeared, and it ſtill appears every day by the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
uſages they ſuffer, and of which we ſhall ſpeak in what follows.
But we ſhall, firſt, mention a preparatory Machin, which the
Perſecutors have not fail'd to employ to effect their Deſign, and
which we have reckoned to be the Sixth in order. It conſiſts in
diſpoſing inſenſibly the People by degrees to deſire our Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
to approve of it when done, and to diminiſh in their Mind
the Horror which naturally they muſt have at the Cruelties and
Injuſtices of our Perſecutors Contrivances. For this parpoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
means have been uſed, and the commoneſt have been the
Sermons of the Miſſionaries and other Controverſial Preachers,
with which the Kingdom has been for ſome years ſtockt, under
the Title of <hi>Royal Miſſions.</hi> There were fitting Youths, choſen
for this purpoſe, who had ſuch an Education given them, which
was ſo far from making them Moderate, as rather enflamed them;
ſo that 'tis eaſy to comprehend what Actors theſe are, when they
not only found themſelves upheld, but ſaw themſelves moreover
ſet on, and had expreſs Orders to inſpire their Hearers with Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.
And ſo well did they acquit themſelves herein, that 'twas
not their fault if Popular Emotions have not followed thereon
in great Cities, yea in <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, had not the Prudence of the
Magiſtrates hindred them. To the Preachers we muſt join the
Confeſſors and Directors of Mens Conſciences, the Monks, the
Curates, and in general, all the Eccleſiaſticks from the higheſt to
the loweſt; for they being not ignorant of the Courts Intention
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61156:10"/>
in this matter, every one ſtrove to ſhew moſt Zeal, and Averſion
to the Reformed Religion, becauſe every one found his Intereſt
lay therein, this being the only way to raiſe and eſtabliſh his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
In this deſign of animating the People, there paſt few days
wherein the Streets did not ring, as well with the publication of
Decrees, Edicts, and Declarations againſt the Proteſtants, as alſo
with Satyrical and Seditious Libels, of which the People in the
Towns of <hi>France</hi> are very greedy.</p>
            <p>But theſe things ſerved only for the meaner ſort of People, and
the Perſecutors had this Mortification to ſee this Deſign diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by all thoſe who were a degree above the Mobile. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they employed the Pens of ſome of their Authors, who had
acquired any Reputation in the World; and amongſt others, that
of the Author of the Hiſtory of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great, and that
of Mr. <hi>Maimburg,</hi> heretofore a Jeſuite. He publiſh'd his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> of which he has ſince had the leaſure to repent,
by the ſmart and pertinent Anſwers which have been given him:
Their Example has been followed by ſeveral others; and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Arnaud,</hi> who will always make one in theſe matters, would
not deny himſelf the ſatisfaction of venting his Choler; and at
the ſame time endeavour to recover the Favour he has loſt at
Court. But although his Apology for the Catholicks was a Work
as full of Fire and Paſſion as the <hi>Bigots</hi> themſelves could Wiſh, yet
'twas not agreeable, becauſe his perſon was not; he was ſo ill gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it, that he complained thereof to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rheims,</hi>
in a Letter, the Copies whereof were diſperſed over all <hi>Paris.</hi>
Amongſt other things, he exaggerated his Misfortune, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
himſelf with another, who for much leſs Services, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Twenty Thouſand Livers, as a Reward from the King. This
more and more ſhewed the Character of the Perſon. However
they needed not him, not wanting violent Writers, amongſt
whom we muſt not forget one Mr. <hi>Soulier,</hi> formerly (as they ſay)
a Taylor, and at preſent Author of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Edicts <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Proteſtants convinced of Schiſm:</hi> nor the Author of the
<hi>Journal des Scavants,</hi> who, in his ordinary Gazets highly affirms.
That the Catholick Faith muſt be planted by Fire and Sword, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
for the proof thereof a King of <hi>Norway,</hi> who converted
the Nobles of his country, by threatning them, <hi>To ſtay their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61156:11"/>
before their Eyes, if they would not conſent to have them baptized,
and to be baptized themſelves.</hi> For a long time we have ſeen in
<hi>Paris,</hi> and elſewhere, nothing but ſuch ſort of Writings to ſuch
a height was Paſſion come.</p>
            <p>Whilſt all theſe things, which we have here obſerved, were
done in <hi>France,</hi> they by great ſteps advanced to their end. 'Tis
not to be imagined the Reformed neglected their common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
or did not all that reſpected a juſt and lawful Defence. They
frequently ſent, from the furtheſt Provinces, their Deputies to
the Court; They maintained their Rights before the Council;
Thither they brought their Complaints from all parts. They
employed their Deputy General to ſolicit their Intereſts, as well
with the Judges and Miniſters of State, as with the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Sometimes alſo they preſented general Addreſſes, in which
they expoſed their Grievances, with all the Humility and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
that Subjects owe their Soveraigns. But they were ſo
far from being heard, that their Troubles were ſtill encreaſed, and
their Second Condition became worſe than the Firſt. The laſt
Petition, preſented to the King himſelf, by the Deputy General,
in <hi>March,</hi> 1684. was expreſt in Terms moſt ſubmiſſive, and moſt
capable of moving Pity, as every one may judge, having been
ſince Printed; and yet it produced no other Fruit, but the haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of what they had long reſolved, namely, to uſe open Force
to accompliſh our Ruine.</p>
            <p>This was effectually done ſome Months after, and executed in
a manner ſo terrible and violent, that, as we ſaid in the beginning,
there are few in <hi>Europe,</hi> how diſtant ſoever from the notice of
the common Accidents of the World, who have not heard the
Report of it; but 'tis certain, the Circumſtances are not known
to all, and therefore we ſhall give an account of them in few
Words; if it be but to ſtop the Mouth of their Impudence, who
publiſht abroad, That no Violences have been offered in <hi>France,</hi>
and the Converſions there made, were with free Conſent. At
firſt they took this Meaſure, to quarter Soldiers in all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
almoſt at the ſame time, and chiefly Dragoons, which are
the moſt Reſolute Troops of the Kingdom. Terror and Dread
marched before them, and as it were, by conſent, all <hi>France</hi> was
filled with this News, That the King would not longer ſuffer any
<hi>Hugonots</hi> in his Kingdom; and that they muſt reſolve to change
their Religion, nothing being able to keep them from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61156:11"/>
They began with <hi>Bearn,</hi> where the Dragoons did their firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions;
theſe were followed ſoon after in High and Low <hi>Guienne,
Xantoigne, Aunix, Poitu,</hi> High <hi>Languedoc, Vivarets,</hi> and <hi>Dauphine;</hi>
after which they came to <hi>Lionois, Gevennes,</hi> Low <hi>Languedoc,
Provence, Valeës,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Geix,</hi> afterwards they fell
on the reſt of the Kingdom, <hi>Normandy, Bourgoigne, Nivernoix,</hi>
and <hi>Berry;</hi> the Countries of <hi>Orleans, Tourain, Anjou, Britany,
Champagne, Picardy,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>France,</hi> not excluding <hi>Paris</hi>
it ſelf, which underwent the ſame Fate; the firſt thing, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
were ordered to do, was to ſummon the Cities and
Commonalties. They aſſembled the Inhabitants thereof, who
profeſt the Reformed Religion, and there told them, 'twas the
King's Pleaſure they ſhould without delay become Catholics;
and if they would not do it freely, they would make them do it
by force, The poor People, ſurpriſed with ſuch a Propoſal, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
They were ready to ſacrifice their Eſtates and Lives to
the King, but their Conſciences, being Gods, they could not in
that manner diſpoſe of them.</p>
            <p>There needed no more to make them immediately bring the
Dragoons, which were not far off. The Troops immediately
ſeized on the Gates and Avenues of the Cities; they placed
Guards in all the Paſſages, and often came with their Swords in
their Hands, crying, <hi>Kill, Kill, or elſe be Catholics,</hi> they were
quartered on the Reformiſts at Diſcretion, with a ſtrict Charge,
that none ſhould depart out of their Houſes, nor conceal any of
their Goods or Effects, on great Penalties, even on the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics,
that ſhould receive or aſſiſt them in any manner. The firſt
days were ſpent in conſuming all Proviſions the Houſe afforded,
and taking from them whatever they could ſee, Money, Rings,
Jewels, and in general, whatſoever was of value. After this,
the pillaged the Family, and invited, not only the Catholics of
the place, but alſo, thoſe of the Neighbouring Cities and Towns,
to come and buy the Goods, and other things which would yield
Money. Afterwards they fell on their Perſons, and there's no
Wickedneſs or Horror which they did not put in practiſe, to force
them to change their Religion. Amidſt a thouſand hideous Cries,
and a thouſand Blaſphemies, they hung Men and Women by the
Hair or Feet, on the Roofs of the Chamber, or Chimney Hooks,
and ſmoakt them with Whiſps of wet Hay, till they were no
longer able to bear it, and when they had taken them down, if
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61156:12"/>
they would not ſing, they hung them up immediately again.
They threw them into great Fires kindled on purpoſe; and pulled
them not out till they were half Roaſted. They tyed Ropes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Arms, and plunged them to and again into Wells, from
whence they would not take them, till they had promiſed to
change their Religion. They tyed them as they do Criminals,
put to the queſtion; and in this poſture, with a Funnel fill'd with
Wine, poured it down their Throats, till the Fumes of it depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them of their Reaſon, they made them ſay they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to be Catholics. They ſtript them naked, and after having
offered them a 1000 infamous Indignities, they ſtuck them with
Pins from the top to the bottom. They cut them with Penknifes,
and ſometimes with red hot Pincers took them by the Noſe, and
dragged them about their Rooms, till they promiſed to become
Catholics, or that the Cries of theſe poor Wretches, that in
this Condition call'd on God for their Aſſiſtance, conſtrained
them to let them go. They beat them with Staves, and dragged
them, all bruiſed, to the Churches, where their bare forced Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
was accounted for an Abjuration. They held them from
ſleeping ſeven or eight Days, relieving one another to watch
them Night and Day, and keept them waking. They threw
Buckets of Water on their Faces, and tormented them a 1000
ways, holding over their Heads Kettles turned downwards,
whereon they made a continual Noiſe, till theſe poor Creatures
had even loſt their Sences. If they found any ſick, either Men
or Women, that kept their Beds, diſtempered with Fevers, or
other Diſeaſes, they had the Cruelty to bring twelve Drums
ſounding an Alarm about their Beds, for whole Weeks together
without Intermiſſion, till they had promiſed they would change.
It hapned in ſome places, that they tyed Fathers and Husbands to
the Bed-Poſts, and before their Eyes forced their Wives and
Daughters. In another place Rapes were publickly and generally
permitted for many Hours together. They pluckt off the Nails
from the Hands and Toes of others, which could not be endured
without intollerable Pain. They burnt the Feet of others. They
blew up Men and Women with Bellows, even till they were
ready to burſt.</p>
            <p>If after theſe horrid uſages, there were yet any that refuſed to
turn, they impriſoned them; and for this choſe Dungeons dark
and noyſom, in which they exerciſed on them all ſorts of Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61156:12"/>
In the mean time they demoliſhed their Houſes, deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Hereditary Lands, cut down their Woods, and ſeized
their Wives and Children, to impriſon them in Monaſteries.
When the Souldiers had devoured and conſumed all in a Houſe,
the Farmers of their Lands furniſht them with Subſiſtance; and
to re-imburſe them, they ſold by Authority of Juſtice the Fonds
of their Hoſts, and put them in poſſeſſion thereof. If ſome, to
ſecure their Conſciences, and to eſcape the Tyranny of theſe Furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men, endeavoured to ſave themſelves by Flight, they were
purſued, and hunted in the Fields and Woods, and were ſhot at
like Wild Beaſts. The Provoſts rode about the High-ways, and
the Magiſtrates of places had orders to ſtop them without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They brought them back to the places from whence they
fled, uſing them like Priſoners of War. But we muſt not fancy,
that this Storm fell only on the common Sort, Noblemen and
Gentlemen of the beſt Quality were not exempted from it. They
had Soldiers quartered upon them in the ſame manner, and with
the ſame Fury as Citizens and Peaſants had. They plundred their
Houſes, waſted their Goods, raſed their Caſtles, cut down their
Woods, and their very Perſons were expoſed to the Inſolence
and Barbarity of the Dragoons, no leſs than thoſe of others.
They ſpared neither Sex, Age, nor Quality; wherever they found
any unwillingneſs to obey the command of changing their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they practiſed the ſame Violences. There were ſtill remaining
ſome Officers of Parliament which underwent the ſame fate, after
having been firſt deprived of their Offices, and even the Military
Officers, who were actually in Service, were ordered to quit their
Poſt and Quarters, and repair immediately to their Houſes, there
to ſuffer the like Storm; if to avoid it, they would not become
Catholics. Many Gentlemen and other Perſons of Quality, and
many Ladies of great Age and antient Families, ſeeing all theſe
Outrages, hoped to find ſome retreat in <hi>Paris,</hi> or at the Court,
not imagining the Dragoons would come to ſeek them ſo near
the Kings Preſence; but this hope was no leſs vain, than all the
reſt; for immediately there was a Decree of Council, which
commanded them to leave <hi>Paris</hi> in Fifteen days, and return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay to their own Houſes; with a prohibition to all Perſons
to entertain or lodge them in their Houſes. Some having attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to preſent Adreſſes to the King, containing Complaints of
theſe cruel Uſages, humbly beſeeching his Majeſty to ſtop the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61156:13"/>
courſe thereof, received no other Anſwer, than that of ſending
them to the <hi>Baſtile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we proceed any further, 'twill not be a miſs to make
ſome Remarks; The firſt ſhall be, that almoſt every where, at
the Head of theſe Infernal Legions, beſides the Commanders
and Military Officers, the Intendants alſo, and the Biſhops march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
every one in his Dioceſs, with a Troop of Miſſionaries Monks,
and other Eccleſiaſticks. The Intendants gave ſuch Order as they
thought moſt fitting to carry on Converſions, and reſtrain natural
Pity and Compaſſion; if at any time it found a place in the Hearts
of Dragoons, or their Commanders, which did not often happen.
And as for the Biſhops, they were there to keep open Houſe, to
receive Abjurations, and to have a general and ſevere Inſpection
that every thing might paſs there according to the Inten<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ons of
the Clergy. The ſecond thing obſervable is, That when the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
had made ſome to yield, by all the Horrors which they
practiſed, they immediately changed their Quarters, and ſent
them to thoſe who ſtill perſevered. This Order was obſerved in this
manner even to the end, inſomuch that the laſt, that is to ſay, thoſe
who had ſhewed the greateſt Conſtancy, had, in fine, quartered
on them alone all the Dragoons, which at the beginning were
equally diſpers'd amonſt the Inhabitants of the place, which was
a load impoſſible to be ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>A Third Remark, which we ſhall make, is, That in almoſt
all the conſiderable Cities, they took care before they ſent Troops
thither, to gain by mean of the Intendants, or ſome other private
way, a certain number of People, not only to change their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
themſelves, when it ſhould be ſeaſonable, but alſo to aſſiſt
them in perverting others. So that when the Dragoons had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
done their part, the Intendant, with the Biſhop, and the
Commander of the Forces, again aſſembled theſe miſerable. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant,
already ruined, to exhort them to obey the King, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Catholics; adding thereto moſt terrible Threats, that they
might over-awe them, and then the new Converts failed not to
execute what they had promiſed, which they did with the more
ſucceſs, becauſe the People did yet put ſome kind of Confidence
in them.</p>
            <p>A fourth Obſervation is, that when the Maſter of the Houſe,
thinking to get rid of the Dragoons, had obeyed and ſigned what
they would, he was not freed from them for all this; if his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61156:13"/>
Wife, Children, and the meaneſt of his Domeſticks did not do
the ſame thing; and when his Wife, or any of his Children or
Family fled, they ceaſed not to torment them, till he had made
them return: which oftentimes being impoſſible, the change of
their Religion did not at all avail them.</p>
            <p>The Fifth is, That when theſe poor wretches fancied their
Conſciences would be at reſt by ſigning ſome form of an Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Abjuration offered them; a little while after theſe cruel men
came to them again, and made them ſign another, which plunged
them into ſuch depths, as caſt them into the utmoſt deſpair. Nay
farther, they had the boldneſs to make them acknowledge, That
they embraced the Roman Religion of their own accord; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having bin induced thereunto by any violent means. If after
this they ſcrupled to go to Maſs, if they did not Communicate,
if they did not tell their Beads; if by a ſigh eſcaped from them,
they ſignified any unwillingneſs, they had immediately a Fine laid
upon them, and they were forced to receive again their old
gueſts.</p>
            <p>In fine, for a ſixth remark; As faſt as the Troops ravaged in
this manner the Provinces, ſpreading terror and deſolation in all
parts; Orders were ſent to all the Frontier Countries and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
Towns, to guard well the paſſages, and ſtop all ſuch who
pretended to eſcape from <hi>France:</hi> So that there was no hope of
theſe poor wretches ſaving themſelves by flight. None were
permitted to paſs, if he brought not along with him a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
from his Biſhop or Curate, that he was a Catholick: others
were put in Priſon, and uſed like Traytors againſt their Country.
All ſtrange Veſſels lying in the Ports were ſearched; the Coaſts,
Bridges, Paſſages to Rivers, and the High-ways, were ſtrictly
guarded, both night and day. The Neighbouring States were
alſo required not to harbour any more Fugitives, and to ſend back
again ſuch as they had already received. Attempts were alſo
mad to ſeiſe on, and carry away ſome, who had eſcaped into
Foreign Countries.</p>
            <p>Whilſt all this was acting in the Kingdom, the Court were
conſulting to give the laſt ſtroak, which conſiſted in repealing the
Edict of <hi>Nantes;</hi> much time was ſpent in drawing up the matter
and form of this new Edict. Some would have the King detain
all the Miniſters, and force them as they did the Laity, to change
their Religion, or condemn them to perpetual Impriſonment.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61156:14"/>
They alledged for their reaſon, that if they did not do it, they
would be as ſo many dangerous Enemies againſt them in Foreign
Nations. Others on the contrary affirmed, that as long as the
Miniſters continued in <hi>France,</hi> this their preſence would encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the People to abide in their Religion, whatſoever care might
be taken to hinder them; and that ſuppoſing they ſhould change,
they would be but as ſo many ſecret adverſaries nouriſhed in the
boſom of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the more dangerous on the
account of their knowledge and experience in Controverſial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
This laſt reaſoning prevailed; 'twas then reſolved on to
baniſh the Miniſters, and to give them no more than fifteen days
time to depart the Kingdom. As to what remained, the Edict
was given to the Procurer-General of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi>
to draw it up in ſuch a form as he ſhould judge moſt fitting. But
before the publiſhing of it, two things were thought neceſſary
to be done; The firſt to oblige the aſſembly of the Clergy, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately
to preſent to the King a requeſt concerning the matter
above mentioned, in which alſo they told his Majeſty, that they
deſired not at preſent the repealing the Edict of <hi>Nantes;</hi> and the
other to ſuppreſs in general, all kind of Books made by them of
the Reformed Religion, and to iſſue out an Order for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
By the firſt of theſe things, the Clergy thought to ſhelter
themſelves from the reproaches, which might be caſt on them as
the Authors of ſo many Miſeries, Injuſtices an Oppreſſions which
this Repeal would ſtill occaſion: And by the other, they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make the Converſions much more eaſie (as they ſtyled
them) and confirm thoſe which had bin already made, by taking
from the People all Books, which might Inſtruct, fortifie, and
bring them back again.</p>
            <p>In fine, This Revocative Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> was ſigned and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> being the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> in the year 1685.
'Tis ſaid the Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi> ſhewed an extream joy in
Sealing it; but it laſted not long, this being the laſt thing he did.
For as ſoon as he came home from <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> he fell ſick,
and dyed within a few days. 'Tis certain, that this mans policy,
rather than his natural Inclination, induced him in his latter years
to become one of our Perſecutors.</p>
            <p>The Edict was Regiſtred in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after in the others. It contains a Preface, and Twelve
Articles. In the Preface, the King ſhews that <hi>Henry</hi> the Great's
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61156:14"/>
Grandfather did not give the Edict, and <hi>Lewis</hi> his Father did not
confirm it, by his other Edict of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> but in the deſign of
endeavouring more effectually the re-union of their Subjects of
the pretended reformed Religion, to the Catholick Church;
and that this was alſo the Deſign which he had himſelf at his firſt
coming to the Crown. That 'tis true, he had bin hindred by the
Wars, which he was forced to carry on againſt the Enemies of his
State; but that at preſent being at Peace with all the Princes of
<hi>Europe,</hi> he wholly gave himſelf to the making of this Re-union.
That God having given him the Grace of accompliſhing it, and
ſeeing the greateſt and beſt part of his Subjects of the ſaid Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had embraced the Catholick one, theſe Edicts of <hi>Nantes</hi> and
<hi>Niſmes</hi> conſequently became void and uſeleſs. By the firſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
he ſuppreſſes and repeals them, in all their extent; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains
that all their Temples; which are found yet ſtanding in his
Kingdom, ſhall be immediately demoliſhed. By the Second, he
forbids all ſorts of Religious Aſſemblies of what kind ſoever.
The Third, prohibits the Exerciſes of Religion to all Lords and
Gentlemen of any Quality, under Corporal Penalties and Confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of their Eſates. The Fourth, baniſhes from his Kingdom
all the Miniſters, and enjoins them to depart thence, within Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
days after the publication of this Edict, under the Penalty of
being ſent to the Gallies. In the Fifth and Sixth, he promiſes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences
and Advantages to the Miniſters and their Widows,
who ſhould change their Religion. In the Seventh and Eighth,
he forbids the Inſtructing of Children in the pretended reformed
Religion, and ordains that thoſe who ſhall be born henceforward
ſhall be baptiſed, and brought up in the Catholick Religion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
Parents to ſend them to the Churches, under the Penalty
of being fined 500 Livers. The Ninth gives Four Months time
to ſuch Perſons as have departed already out of the Kingdom to
return, otherwiſe their Goods and Eſtates to be confiſcated.
The Tenth, with repeated Prohibitions, forbids all his Subjects
of the ſaid Religion to depart out of his Realm, they, their Wives
and Children, or to convey away their Effects, under pain of the
Gallies for the Men, and of Confiſcation of Body and Goods for
the Women. The Eleventh, confirms the Declarations heretofore
made againſt thoſe that Relapſe. The Twelfth declares, that as
to the reſt of his Subjects of the ſaid Religion, they may, till God
enlightens them, remain in the Cities of his Kingdom, Countries
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61156:15"/>
and Lands of his Obedience, there continue their Commerce, and
enjoy their Eſtates, without Trouble or Moleſtation upon pretence
of the ſaid Religion, on condition, that they have no Aſſemblies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretext of Praying, or exerciſing any religious Worſhip what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>In order to put this Edict in execution, the very ſame day that
it was regiſtred and publiſhed at <hi>Paris,</hi> they began to demoliſh
the Church of <hi>Charenton.</hi> The eldeſt Minſter thereof was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to leave <hi>Paris</hi> within twenty four Hours, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to depart the Kingdom. For this end they put him into the
Hands of one of the Kings Footmen, with orders not to leave
him till he was out of his Dominions. His Collegues were little
better treated, they gave them forty eight hours to quit <hi>Paris,</hi>
and then left them upon their Parole. The reſt of the Miniſters
were allowed fifteen days, but it can hardly be believed to what
Vexations and Cruelties they were all expoſed. Firſt of all, they
neither permitted them to diſpoſe of their Eſtates, nor to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
any of their moveables or effects, nay they diſputed them
their Books and private Papers, one pretence, that they muſt juſtify,
their Books and Papers did not belong to the Coſiſtories wherein
they ſerv'd, which was a thing impoſſible, ſince there were no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories,
that then remained. Beſide, they would not give them
leave to take along with them either Father or Mother, or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or Siſter, or any of their Kindred, though there were many of
them infirm, decay'd and poor, which could not ſubſiſt but by their
means; they went ſo far, as even to deny them their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
if they were above ſeven Years Old; nay, ſome they took
from them that were under that Age, and even ſuch as yet hang'd
upon their Mothers Breaſts. They refuſed them Nurſes for their
new born Infants, which the Mothers could not give Suck. In
ſome Frontier Places they ſtopped and impriſoned them, upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ridiculous Pretences; they muſt immediately prove that they
were really the ſame Perſons, which their Certificates mentioned;
they were to know immediately whether there were no Criminal
Proceſs or Informations againſt them; they muſt preſently juſtify,
that they carryed away nothing that belonged to their Flocks;
ſometime after they had thus detained and amuſed them, they
were told that the fifteen days of the Edict were expired, and that
they ſhould not have Liberty to retire, but muſt go to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
There is no kind of Deceit and Injuſtice which they did not
think of to involve them in Troubles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61156:15"/>
As to the reſt, whom the Force of Perſecution and hard Uſage
conſtrained to leave their Houſes and Eſtates, and to fly the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
it is not to be imagined what dangers they expoſed them to.
Never were Orders more ſevere or more ſtrict, than thoſe that
were given againſt them. They doubled the Guards in Poſts, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
High-Ways, and Foards, they covered the Country with
Solders, they armed even the Peſants to ſtop thoſe that paſſed,
or to kill them: They forbad all the Officers of the Cuſtoms to
ſuffer any Goods, Moveables, Marchandize, or other Effects, to
paſs. In a Word, they forgot nothing that could hinder the flight
of the perſecuted, even to the interrupting almoſt all Commerce
with Neighbouring Nations: By this means they quickly filled
all the Priſons in the Kingdom; for the fear of the Dragoons,
the Horror of ſeeing their Conſciences forced, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
taken away, and of living for the future in a Land where
there was neither Juſtice nor Humanity for them, obliged every
one to think of an eſcape, and to abandon all to ſave their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
All theſe poor Priſoners have been ſince treated with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of Rigours, ſhut up in Dungeons, loaded with heavy Chains,
almoſt ſtarved with Hunger, and deprived of all Converſe, but
that of their Perſecutors. They put many into Monaſteries, where
they experience none of the leaſt Cruelties; Some there are ſo
happy as to dye in the midſt of their Torments, others have at
laſt ſunk under the Weight of the Temptation, and ſome by the
extraordinary Aſſiſtance of Gods Grace, do ſtill ſuſtain it with an
Heroick Courage.</p>
            <p>Theſe have been the Conſequences of this new Edict in this
reſpect; but who would not have believed that the Twelfth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
would have ſhelter'd the reſt of the Reformed; that had a
mind ſtill to ſtay in the Kingdom, ſince this Article exprefly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
them, that they may live there, continue their Trade, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
their Eſtates, without being troubled or moleſted upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of their Religion. Yet ſee what they have ſince done, and yet
do to theſe poor Wretches. They have not recall'd the Dragoons
and other Soldiers which they diſpatcht into the Provinces before
the Edict: On the contrary, they to this day commit with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Fury the ſame Inhumanities, which we have before repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
beſides this, they have marched them into Provinces, where
there were none before, as <hi>Normandy, Picardy, le Berry, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne,
Nivernois, Orleans, Beleſſois,</hi> and the lſle of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61156:16"/>
They do the ſame Violence there, exert the ſame Fury they do in
other Provinces. <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, where methinks this Article of
the Edict ſhould have been beſt obſerved, becauſe ſo near the
Kings Preſence, and more immediately under the Government
of the Court, <hi>Paris,</hi> I ſay, was no more ſpared than the reſt of the
Kingdom. The very day that the Edict was publiſhed, without
more delay, the Procurer-General, and ſome other Magiſtrates,
began to ſend for Heads of Families to come to their Houſes.
There they declared to them that 'twas abſolutely the Kings
Will that they ſhould change their Religion, that they were no
better than the reſt of his Subjects, and that if they would not do
it willingly, the King would make uſe of means, which he had
ready, to compel them. At the ſame time they baniſh'd by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
under the Privy Seal, all the Elders of the Conſiſtory, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with ſome others, in whom they found more of Conſtancy
and Reſolution; and to diſperſe them, choſe ſuch places as were
moſt remote from Commerce, where they have ſince uſed them
with a great deal of Cruelty, ſome complyed, others are yet
under Sufferings.</p>
            <p>The diligence of the Procurer-General and Magiſtrates, not
ſucceeding ſo fully as they wiſh'd, though Threats and Menaces
were not wanting, <hi>Monſieur Seignelay,</hi> Secretary of State, would
alſo try what influence he could have within his Diviſion at <hi>Paris.</hi>
For this end, he got together about five or ſix ſcore Merchants,
and others into his Houſe, and after having ſhut the doors, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
preſented them with the form of an Abjuration, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them in the Kings Name to ſign it; declaring, that they
ſhould not ſtir out of Doors till they had obeyed. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of this Form were, not only that they did renounce the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and enter into the Catholick Church, but alſo
that they did this voluntarily, and without being forced or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to it. This was done in an Imperious manner, and with
an air of Authority, yet there were ſome that dared to ſpeak,
but they were ſharply anſwer'd, That they were not to diſpute
it, but to obey; ſo that they all Sign'd before they went out.</p>
            <p>To theſe Methods they added others more terrible, as Priſons,
actually ſeizing of their Effects, and Papers; the taking away of
their Children, the ſeparation of Husbands and Wives; and in
fine, the great Method, that is to ſay, Dragoons and Guards.
Thoſe that moſt firmly ſtood out, they ſent to the <hi>Bastile,</hi> and to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61156:16"/>
the <hi>Fort l'Eveque;</hi> they confin'd them to their own or other
Houſes, where they lay concealed for fear of Diſcovery; they
plunder'd thoſe of many others, not ſparing their perſons, juſt as
they had done in other places.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>12th</hi> Article of the Edict, which promiſed ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation,
and a ſhadow of Liberty, was nothing but an egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deceit to amuſe the credulous, and keep them from thinking
to make their eſcape, a ſnare to catch them with the more eaſe.
The Fury ſtill kept its uſual courſe, and was heated to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that not content with the Deſolations in the Kingdom, it
entred even into <hi>Orange,</hi> a Soveraign Principality, where the King
of Right has no power, and taking Miniſters away from thence
by force, remov'd them into Priſons. Thither the Dragoons
were ſent, who committed all kind of miſchief; and by force
conſtrained the Inhabitants thereof, both Men, Women and
Children, and the very Officers of the Prince to change their
Religion. And this is the ſtate of things in the year 1685. and
this is the accompliſhment of the dealing which the Clergy has
ſhewed us three years ſince, towards the end of their Paſtoral
Letter; <hi>You muſt expect miſchieſs more dreadful and intolerable, then
all thoſe, which hitherto your Revolts and Schiſms have drawn down
upon you.</hi> And truly they have not been worſe than their words.
There are ſome in the Kingdom who ſtill continue firm, and
their Perſecutions are ſtill continu'd to them. There are invented
every day new Torments, againſt thoſe whom force has made to
change their Religion, becauſe they are ſtill obſerved to ſigh, and
groan under their hard ſervitude; their hearts deteſting what
their months have profeſt, and their hands ſigned. As to ſuch that
have eſcaped into Foreign Countreys, who are at leaſt 150000
perſons, their Eſtates are Confiſcated; this being all the hurt
which can be done to them at preſent. I ſay at preſent; for 'tis
not to be queſtioned, but our Perſecutors are contriving to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their Cruelties farther. But we muſt hope in the compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God, that whatſoever intentions they may have in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Proteſtant Religion in all places, he will not permit them
to effect their deſigns. The World will ſurely open its Eyes; and
this which they now come from doing with a high hand, and a
worſe then barbarous Fury, will ſhew not only the Proteſtants;
but the wiſe and circumſpect Catholicks, what they are to expect,
both one and the other, from ſuch a ſort of People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61156:17"/>
In effect, he that ſhall give himſelf the leiſure to reflect on the
matters of Fact which we come now from relating, which are
things certain, and acted in the face of the Sun, he ſhall ſee not
only the Proteſtants ſuppreſt, but the King's Honour ſullied, his
Countreys damnified; all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> intereſſed, and
even the Pope himſelf, with his Church and Clergy, ſhamefully
diſcredited.</p>
            <p>For to begin with the King himſelf: What could be more
contrary to his Dignity, then to put him upon breaking his word,
and perſwading him that he might with a ſafe Conſcience violate,
revoke, and annul ſo ſolemn an Edict as that of <hi>Nantes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To palliate in ſome ſort the Violence of this proceeding, they
make him ſay in this new Edict, <hi>That the beſt and greateſt part of
the Reform'd Religion has imbraced the Catholick; and therefore the
execution of the Edict of</hi> Nantes, <hi>and whatſoever elſe has been done
in favour of the ſame Religion, remains void.</hi> But is not this an
Eluſion unworthy of his Majeſty, ſeeing that if this beſt and
greateſt part of his Subjects of the Reformed Religion have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the Catholick; they have done it by force of Arms, and
by the cruel and furious Oppreſſion which his own Troops have
laid upon them.</p>
            <p>Perhaps one might thus ſpeak, had his Subjects changed their
Religion of their own free will, although that in this caſe too,
the Priviledges of the Edict continue for thoſe that remain. But
after having forced them to change by the horrible inhumanities
of his Dragoons; after having deprived them of the Liberty
which the Edict gave them; to ſay coldly, that he only revokes
the Edict, becauſe it is now uſeleſs, is a Raillery unbefitting ſo great
a Prince. For it is as much as if he ſaid, that he was indeed obliged
to continue to his Proteſtant Subjects all the Priviledges due to
them; but having himſelf overthrown them by a <hi>major</hi> Force, he
finds himſelf at preſent lawfully and fairly diſengaged from this
Obligation: Which is juſt as if a Father, who himſelf had cut his
Childrens Throats, ſhould glory in the being henceforward freed
from the care of nouriſhing and protecting them. Are other Kings
wont thus to expreſs themſelves in their Edicts?</p>
            <p>What they make him moreover ſay, to wit, <hi>That</hi> Henry <hi>the
Great, his Grandfather, gave only the Edict of</hi> Nantes <hi>to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
that he might the better effect their re-union to the</hi> Roman
<hi>Church;</hi> That <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>13th</hi> alſo, his Father, had the ſame deſign,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61156:17"/>
when he gave the Edict of <hi>Niſmes;</hi> and that he himſelf had en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tred
therein at his coming to the Crown, is but a pitiful <hi>Salvo.</hi>
But ſuppoſe (ſeeing they are willing we ſhould do ſo) the truth
of this Diſcourſe, and take we it ſimply, and according to the
Letter, in the ſenſe wherein they gave it us, what can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thence, but theſe following Propoſitions: That <hi>Henry</hi> the
Great, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>13th,</hi> gave only the Edicts to our Fathers
to deceive them, and with an intent to ruine them afterwards
with the greater eaſe, under the mask of this Fraud. That not
being able to do this, being hindred by other affairs, they have
committed this important ſecret to his preſent Majeſty, to the end
he ſhould execute it when he met with an opportunity. That his
preſent Majeſty entring into the thought of this at his firſt coming
to the Crown, he only confirm'd the Edicts and Declarations of
1643. and 1652. with other advantagious Decrees to the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religion, but to impoſe on them the more finely, (lay ſnares in
their way) or if you pleaſe, crown them, as they crown'd of
old the Sacrifices; That all that has been done againſt them, ſince
the Peace of the <hi>Pirenees,</hi> till this time, according to the abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which we have made of it, has been only the execution of a
Project, but of a Project far more ancient than we imagine,
ſeeing we muſt date it from the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and aſcend up
to <hi>Henry</hi> the Great: In fine, That what has been till now, has been
a great myſtery, but is not one at preſent; ſeeing the King by this
new Edict diſcovers it to all the World, that he may be applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it.</p>
            <p>Will it not be acknowledged that the Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> who are
willing to diſcredit the Conduct of its Kings, and render them odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the World, have now an happy opportunity. <hi>Henry</hi> the
Great gives his Edict to the Proteſtants with the greateſt Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
imaginable, he gives it them as a Recompence of their Services;
he promiſes ſolemnly to obſerve it; and as if this was not enough,
he binds himſelf thereunto with an Oath; he executes it to the
utmoſt of his Power, and they peaceably enjoy'd it to the end of
his Reign: yet all this is but a meer Snare, for they are to be
Dragoon'd at a proper time: But being himſelf ſurprized by
Death, he could not do it, but leaves it in charge to <hi>Lewis</hi> the
<hi>13th</hi> his Son. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth aſcends the Throne, iſſues
out his Declaration immediately, that he acknowledges the Edict
of <hi>Nantes</hi> as perpetual and irrevocable, it needing not a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61156:18"/>
and that he would Religiouſly obſerve every Article
of it, and therefore ſends Commiſſioners to ſee it actually execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
When he begins a War, he proteſts he deſigns not at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and in effect he permits the full Liberty of it, in thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Towns he takes by Aſſault: He gives his Edict of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> as
the Edict of a Triumphant Prince, yet declares therein he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands,
that of <hi>Nantes</hi> ſhould be inviolably kept, and ſhows himſelf
to the laſt as good as his Word. But this is only intended to lull the
Proteſtants aſleep, in expectation of a favourable occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, at his coming to the Crown
confirms the Edict, and declares, That he will maintain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in all their Priviledges; he afterwards affirms in another
Declaration, how highly he is ſatisfied in their Services; and
mentions his deſign of making them to enjoy their Rights. But
this is but a meer amuſement, and an artifice to intrap them, the
better to colour over the project of ruining them at a convenient
time. What a Character now of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> will this
afford, to its Enemies, and foreign Nations; and what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
do they think, will be henceforward put in their Promiſes
and Treaties; for if they deal thus with their own Subjects, if
they careſs them only to ruine them, what may Strangers expect
from 'em. Conſider we a while what they make the King ſay,
That at his firſt coming to the Crown, he was in the deſign which
he now comes from executing. They would ſay without doubt,
from the time he actually took in hand the Reins of Government;
for he was too young before, to enter perſonally on any deſign
of this nature: he enter'd thereon then preciſely at the time,
when the Civil Wars were ended. But what does this mean,
but that he undertook this deſign, at the very time when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
came from rendring him the moſt important Service Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
were ever capable of. They came from rendring him the
higheſt Teſtimonies of Loyalty, when the greateſt part of his
other Subjects had taken up Arms againſt him. They had vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
oppoſed his Enemies progreſs; rejected the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
offers, kept Towns for him, yea whole Provinces; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
his Servants and Officers into their Boſoms, when they
could not find ſafety elſewhere; ſacrificed their Eſtates to him,
their Lives, their Fortunes; and in a word, done all with ſuch
a Zeal, as becomes faithful Subjects in ſo dangerous a conjuncture.
And this is the time when the King enters on the deſign of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61156:18"/>and extirpating them. This ſo confirms the Truth of
what we ſaid in the beginning, that it puts it out of all queſtion,
that the Project of their Deſtruction was grounded on the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they had rendred the King. <hi>Do Chriſtian Ethics</hi> allow theſe moſt
unchriſtian Policies? Is it not a ſtrange thing, that we muſt be
taught this important Secret, and all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides; for although
the Proteſtants have done nothing in this occaſion but their Duty,
it could never be imagined their Duty ſhould be made their
Crime, and their Ruine ſhould ſpring from whence ſhould come
the Safety. God has brought Light out of Darkneſs, but the
unchriſtian Politicks of <hi>France,</hi> on the contrary, has brought
Darkneſs out of Light. However they cannot deny but that in
this new Edict, the King is made to ſay, <hi>He has entred on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to diſtroy the Proteſtant Party, in the very time wherein they
have ſignaliz'd and diſtinguiſht themſelves with great ſucceſs for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Crown,</hi> which will furniſh perhaps matter enough to
thinking Men for Reflexion, as well within as without the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and will ſhew them what uſe is made of Services, and what
Recompence is to be expected for them.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall ſay no more of the Expreſſions of the new Edict,
but rather conſider the matter of it. Was ever a worſe and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
uſage than that which we have ſuffered for the ſpace of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years, which have been employed informing the late Tempeſt
which has fallen upon us. It has been a continual Storm of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
Edicts, Declarations, Orders, Condemnation of Churches,
Deſolation of Temples, Civil and Criminal Proceſſes, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments,
Baniſhments, Pennances, Pecuniary Mults, Privation
of Offces and Employs, depriving Parents of their Children,
and all thoſe other Perſecutions which we have already briefly
ſum'd up. We are told on one hand, that the King would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to us the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> and he delivered himſelf on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
occaſions to that Effect; and on the other hand we were made
to ſuffer in our Eſtates, our Reputations, our Perſons, our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
in our Religion, and our Conſciences, and all by unjuſt and
indirect ways; by unheard of Inventions, by Oppreſſions, and
publick Vexation, and ſometime under-hand Dealings; and all
this under the Vail of the Kings Authority, and becauſe this was
his good pleaſure. We know very well the Authority of Kings,
and the Reſpect and Submiſſion with which we ſhould receive
their Orders. And therefore have we, during all theſe unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61156:19"/>
Uſages, a Patience, and an Obedience ſo remarkable,
that it has been an Admiration of the Catholicks themſelves, our
Countrymen. But it muſt be acknowledged that thoſe who put
his Majeſty on dealing thus with us, or have uſed his Name and
Authority for this, could not do him otherwiſe a greater diſhonor
than they have done. For after all, thoſe Kings who would have
themſelves eſteemed for their Juſtice and Equity, govern not their
Subjects after this manner. They are not for putting all to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
filling all places with Lamentation and Terror. They
ſeek not their ſatisfaction in the Tears, and Groans of their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
People, nor are they pleaſed with keeping their Subjects in
a perpetual Agitation. They love not to have their Names mention'd
with terror, nor meditate continual deſigns of extirpating thoſe,
who give conſtant and unqueſtionable Proofs of their Loyalty; much
leſs to invent cruel projects, which like Mines, in their time ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
their own Natural Subjects; for what elſe have been theſe ſlie
and equivocal Declarations, Counter-Orders, and revocative Edicts.</p>
            <p>There are three things, very remarkable, in this whole Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
the Firſt is, that as long as they have been only in the way,
the true Authors of the Perſecution have not concealed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but the King, as much as they could: 'Tis true, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
Edicts, and Declarations, and other things, went under
the name of his Majeſty; but at the requeſt of the Agents, and
Factors for the Clergy: And whilſt they were buſied in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the King declared openly his Intention of maintaining the
Edicts, and that 'twas abuſes which he deſign'd to correct. The
Second is, that when they came to the laſt Extremities, and to
open force, then they have concealed themſelves as much as they
could, ſet forth the King at his full Length. There was nothing
beard but theſe kind of Diſcourſes, <hi>The King will have it ſo, the
King has taken it in hand, the King proceeds further than the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
deſires;</hi> by theſe two means they have had the Addreſs to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charg'd with the leſſer parts of the cruelties, and to lay the moſt
violent, and odious part at the Kings door. The Third thing which
we ſhould remark is, that the better to obtain their Ends, they
have made it their buſineſs to perſwade the King, that this Work
would Crown him with Glory, which is a horrid abuſe of his
credulity, an abuſe ſo much the greater, by how much they would
not have themſelves thought the Authors of this Council; and
when any particular perſon of them are ask'd this day, <hi>What
they think of it,</hi> there are few of them but condemn it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61156:19"/>
In effect, what more falſe an Idea could they give to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
of Glory, than to make it conſiſt in ſurpriſing a poor People,
diſperſt over all his Kingdom, and living ſecurely under his Wings
and the Remains of the Edict of <hi>Nants;</hi> and who could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
there were any Intentions of depriving them of the Liberty
of their Conſciences, of ſurprizing and overwhelming them in an
Inſtant, with a numerous Army, to whoſe diſcretion they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered;
and who tell them that they muſt either by fair means
or foul, become <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, this being the Kings will and
pleaſure. What a falſer Notion of Glory could they offer him, than
the putting him in the place of God, making the Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of Men to depend upon his Authority, and that hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
it muſt be ſaid in his Kingdom, <hi>I don't believe becauſe I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
of it, but I believe, becauſe the King would have me do it;</hi>
which to ſpeak properly, is, that I believe nothing, and that I'le
be a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Jew,</hi> or whatever the King pleaſes. What falſer
Idea of Glory, then to force from Mens Mouths by Violence,
and a long Series of Torments; a Profeſſion, which the Heart
abhors, and for which one ſighs night and day, crying continually
to God for Mercy. What Glory is there in inventing new ways
of Perſecutions, unknown to former Ages; which indeed do not
bring Death along with them, but keep Men alive to ſuffer, that
they may overcome their Patience and Conſtancy by Cruelties,
which are above Humane Strength to undergo? What Glory is
there in not contenting themſelves to force thoſe who remain in
his Kingdom, but to forbid them to leave it, and keep them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a double Servitude, <hi>viz.</hi> both of Soul and Body? What Glory
is there in keeping his Priſons full of innocent Perſons. who are
charged with no other fault, than ſerving God according to the
beſt of their Knowledge, and for this to be expos'd to the Rage
of the Dragoons, or condemned to the Gallies, and executions
on Body and Goods? Will theſe Cruelties render his Majeſties
Name lovely in his Hiſtory, to the Catholick or Proteſtant
World?</p>
            <p>But we ſhould be very loath to exaggerate any thing, which may
violate the Reſpect due to ſo great a Prince; but we do not
think it a failure in our Duty, fairly to repreſent how far theſe refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Politicians have really intereſs'd his Honour, in the ſad Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
wherein they have plunged us, and how Criminal they have
thereby made themſelves towards him. They have committed no
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61156:20"/>
leſs Miſdemeanours againſt their Country, of which they are
Members, and for which a Man would think they ſhould have
ſome conſideration. Not to ſpeak here of the great number of
Perſons of all Ages, Sexes and Qualities, which they have out
off from it by their fierce Tempers; although perhaps this Loſs
be greater, than they were willing to imagine. Its certain, that
<hi>France</hi> is a very Populous Country, but when theſe Feavouriſh
Fits ſhall be over, and they ſhall in cold Blood conſider what they
have done, they will find theſe Diminutions to be no matter of
Triumph; for 'tis not poſſible, that ſo many Subſtantial People,
ſo many intire Families, who diſtinguiſh themſelves in the Arts,
in the Sciences, Civil and Military, can leave a Kingdom without
one day being miſſed: at preſent, whilſt they rejoyce in their
Spoils, poſſeſs themſelves of the Houſes and Eſtates, this loſs
is not felt; 'tis recompenſed by Booty, but it will not be always
ſo: Neither ſhall we inſiſt here on that almoſt general Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Traffick, which theſe moſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian Perſecutors</hi> have
cauſed in the Principal Towns of the State; although this
be no ſmall Miſchief: The Proteſtants made up a good part
of the Trade, as well within the Kingdom as without, and
were therein ſo mixt with the Catholicks, that their Affairs
were in a manner inſeparable. They dealt as it were in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
when theſe Oppreſſions came upon them; and what
Confuſions have they not produced? How many induſtrious
meaſures have they broken? How many honeſt deſigns have they
not diſappointed? How many Manufactures ruined? How many
Bankrupts made? and how many Families reduced to Beggary?
But this is what the Oppreſſors little trouble themſelves about;
they have their Bread gained to their Mouths, they live in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs
and eaſe; and whilſt others dye with Hunger, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
are aſcertain'd to them. But this hinders not the Body of
the Eſtate to ſuffer, both in its Honour and Profit; and we may
truly ſay, that Four Civil Wars could not have produced ſo much
Miſchief, as time will ſhew to ſprink from this Perſecution.</p>
            <p>But we will leave the conſequence of this affair to time, and
only ſay, That the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> being a fundamental Law of
the Kingdom; and an agreement between two parties, by a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
acceptation under the peaceable Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great;
by the publick Faith, and by mutual Oaths, as we have already
ſeen; this muſt certainly be of ill example to the intereſt of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61156:20"/>
State: That after having made a thouſand infractions of it, it
muſt be at length revok'd, cancel'd, and annul'd, at the motion
of a Cabal, who abuſe their intereſt; and hereby make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
fit for enterpriſing, and executing any thing. After this
Violation, what can henceforward be thought firm and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in <hi>France.</hi> I ſpeak not of particular mens affairs, but of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
eſtabliſhments, Royal Companies Courts of Juſtice, and
all other ranks of men intereſted in Society, even they very rights
of the Crown, and form of Government. There are in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
a great many thinking men, I mean not your Poets, and ſuch
like kind of Flatterers, who make Verſes, Orations, Panegyricks,
and Sermons too for Preferments and Benefices; but I ſpeak of
ſolid and judicious perſons; who ſee into the conſequences of
things; and know well how to judge of them; ſhall we think
that theſe men, ſee not what is too viſible, that the State is
pierc'd through and through, by the ſame <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low given the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;
and that ſuch a open revocation of the Edict, leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
firm or ſacred. It's to no purpoſe to alledge diſtinctions in
the matter, and ſay that the pretended reform'd Religion, was
odious to the State, and therefore was thus undertaken. For not
to mention the dangerouſneſs of the example; as to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
averſion to our Religion in the minds of the Catholicks,
it is certain, that excepting the Faction of the Bigots, and what
they call the propagators of the Faith; neither the Commons,
nor great People, have any animoſity againſt us; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
do bemoan our misfortunes. Not to touch further on this,
who knows not what an eaſie matter it is to run down any cauſe,
or render it odious or indifferent in the minds of the People.
There are never wanting reaſons and pretences, in matters of this
nature; one party is ſet up againſt another; and that is called
the State, right or wrong, which is the prevailing one: like as
in Religion, not the beſt and honeſteſt, <hi>but the powerfulleſt, and
boldeſt part, are termed the Church.</hi> We muſt not judge of theſe
things then from their matter, but their from. Now if ever
there was ſince the World ſtood, a matter authentick and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable,
it was the Edict of <hi>Nantes;</hi> To revoke and cancel it,
is to ſet up ones ſelf above our obligations to God, as well as to
Men; 'tis to declare openly, that there are no longer any ties or
promiſes in the world. And this is no more then the wiſe will
eaſily comprehend, and I doubt not but they have done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61156:21"/>
Some perhaps may make an objection on this occaſion, which
'twill be good to anſwer; which is, that as the Edict, conſider it
how we will, is become only a Law of State by <hi>Henry</hi> the
Great's Authority ſo it may likewiſe be revok'd and annul'd by
<hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>14th</hi> his Grandſon and Succeſſor. For things may be
ended by the ſame means they have bin begun. If <hi>Henry</hi> the
Great, has had the power to change the form of governing the
State, by introducing a new Law; why has not <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>14th</hi>
the ſame power to alter this form, and annul whatſoever his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor
has done? But this objection will ſoon be anſwer'd, by
conſidering it's built upon a falſe principal, and offers a falſer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.
It is not the ſingle Authority of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great
which has eſtabliſh'd the Edict. The Edict is a Decree of his
Juſtice, and an accord or tranſaction that paſt between the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
and the Reformiſts. Authoriz'd by the publick Faith of the
whole Eſtate, and ſeal'd with the ſeal of an Oath, and ratified by
the execution of it; now this renders the Edict inviolable, and
ſets it above the reach of <hi>Henry</hi>'s Succeſſors; and therefore they
can be only the Depoſitaries and Executors of it, and not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to make it depend on their wills. <hi>Henry</hi> the Great never
employ'd the force of Arms to make the Catholicks conſent to
it; and though ſince his death, under the minority of <hi>Lewis</hi> the
<hi>13th.</hi> there have bin Aſſemblies of the States General, the Edict
has remain'd in full force; 'twas then, as we have already ſaid,
a fundamental Law of the Kingdom, which the King could not
touch. But ſuppoſing this were not a work grounded on the bare
Authority of <hi>Henry,</hi> which is falſe, it does not therefore follow,
that his preſent Majeſty can revoke it. The Edict is a Royal
Promiſe, which <hi>Henry</hi> the Great made to the Reformiſts of his
Kingdom, as well for himſelf as his Succeſſors for ever; as we
have already ſeen; and conſequently this is a condition or heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<hi>Debt,</hi> charged on himſelf and Poſterity. Moreover, it is
not true, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, has changed any thing in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the State, when he gave Liberty of Conſcience to
his Subjects; for this Liberty is matter of right, and more invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable
than all Edicts, ſeeing that it is a right of Nature. He
has permitted a publick exerciſe of the Reformed Religion; but
this exerciſe was eſtabliſhed in the Kingdom before his Edict,
and if he has enlarged the priviledges of the Reformed, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt he has, he did not do it without the Conſent and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61156:21"/>
of the State; and has herein violated nothing of his
lawful engagements. But 'tis not the ſame with <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>14th.</hi>
who of his own pure Authority, makes a real and fundamental
Change, againſt the concurrence of one part of his Eſtate, and
without the conſulting the other; hereby violating his own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
thoſe of his Kingdom, and even the Laws of Nature
too. In fine, if we conſider what means have been uſed to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at the Revocation in queſtion, how ſhall a man not ackow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the State is ſenſibly intereſted therein. They are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to ſuppreſs the Religious Aſſemblies, and to null the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
priviledges by unjuſt Decrees; but they alſo ſend them
Soldiers <hi>to diſpute points of Religion with them;</hi> They are Sack't
like People taken by Aſſault, forced in their Conſciences; and
for this purpoſe, Hell it ſelf is let looſe upon them; and <hi>this is
the effects of a Military, and Arbitrary Government, regulated nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Juſtice, Reaſon, nor Humanity.</hi> Can it be thought, that,
<hi>France</hi> will be at eaſe in this manner, or that wiſe people will
think this an equitable way of governing? There needs only ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſign, another paſſion to ſatisfie, another vengeance to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute;
and then, wo be to them who ſhall oppoſe it; for the
Dragoons will not forget their Office.</p>
            <p>To theſe two Reflections, which reſpect the <hi>French</hi> King and
his States, we may add a third, which will have regard to the
Intereſts of Kings, Princes, and other powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> as well
of one as of the other Religion. We ſhall not be much miſtaken,
if we ſay, that they have a common and general concern herein;
inaſmuch as theſe skilful Artiſts in miſery, do as much as they can
to trouble the good underſtanding that is betwixt them and their
People. We are perſwaded, that their wiſe and juſt Government
will, in this reſpect, put them beyond all fear: but this hinders
not examples of this nature, from being always miſchievous, and
naturally tending to beget in the minds of the Vulgar, (who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
judge only of things in general) ſuſpitions and diſtruſts of
their Soveraigns, as if they dream'd of nothing but devouring
their Subjects, and delivering them up to the Diſcretion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Fury of their Soldiers. The greater moderation and
Juſtice that Princes have, the leſs they are obliged to thoſe who
furniſh people with matter for ſuch dangerous thoughts, which
may produce very ill Effects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61156:22"/>
Beſide, is it not certain, that the Princes and States of <hi>Europe,</hi>
cannot without a great deal of pleaſure ſee <hi>France,</hi> which makes
ſo great a Figure in the affairs of the World, and gives them ſo
powerful an influence, now put her ſelf in ſuch a condition, as
that no juſt Meaſures can be taken from her? For after ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and publick a violation of the word of three Kings, and
of the publick Faith, what Credit can be given for the future, to
her Promiſes or Treaties? It will not be ſufficient to ſay, that
they will have no force but what Intereſt inſpires; but that they
will hereafter depend on the Intereſt or Capriciouſneſs of a ſort
of Heady People, that will give nothing either to the Laws of
Prudence or Equity, but manage all by force. If they have had
the power, to do within the Kingdom what they have lately put
in execution, what will they not do as to Affairs without? If
they have not ſpared their own Country-men, with whom they
had daily Commerce, who were ſerviceable to them, will they
ſpare the unknown? Will they have more reſpect to Truces or
Conventions of four days Tranſaction, than to an Edict of an
hundred years continuance, and that the moſt Auguſt and Solemn
that ever was which yet they made no other uſe of then to
amuſe a People, and to involve them more ſurely in an utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation?
Methinks they have reſolv'd to bring things to this
paſs, That there being no more Faith to be had in <hi>France,</hi> all her
Neighbours ſhould be continually upon their Guard againſt her,
and the more ſo when ſhe promiſes, then when ſhe threatens;
more in Peace then in War; ſo that there is no more hopes of
being at quiet, but what the Surety of Hoſtages, or the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her Forces can give.</p>
            <p>This being ſo in reſpect of all Princes and States in general,
what may the Proteſtant Princes and States in particular think,
but that it is the deſign of <hi>France</hi> to ruine them all, and to make
no ſtop till ſhe has devoured them. Every body knows, that the
Proteſtant Princes underſtand their Intereſts well enough, to be
able to diſcern them through the Clouds, wherewith they would
cover them; and 'tis not doubted but they ſee, that this is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
or Eſſay, which <hi>France</hi> expects ſhortly to give the laſt
ſtroak to. The Court there has ſuffer'd it ſelf to be poſſeſs'd
with groſs Bigotry, and a falſe Zeal of Catholiciſm. 'Tis the
<hi>Genius a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>la mode;</hi> each there is become a perſecutor, even to
Fire and Sword; and there are ſome perſwaded, that this ſhall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61156:22"/>
weigh down the Ballance. Vain Glory is no ſmall Ingredient in
this deſign, Policy has her Proſpects, and Myſteries in it too; and
as theſe Proſpects have no Bounds, ſo her Myſteries want not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Springs, and ſurpriſing ways, which ſhe will joyn when ſhe
pleaſes to the Power of Arms. She thinks the Seaſon is ripe, and
ſhe needs only to dare. The eaſineſs ſhe has found in making
Conqueſts and Converſions ſwells her Courage, and already ſome
talk of nothing but a further progreſs in ſo fair a way. 'Tis to
be hoped that Proteſtant Princes and States will from thence
draw their juſt Concluſions.</p>
            <p>As to Catholick Princes and States, they have too ſagacious
Judgments, not to ſee how much they ſhare in this Affair. It
will be made uſe of to break the good underſtanding which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> by amuſing thoſe with the fair
Pretext of the Catholick Religion, and cunningly inſpiring theſe
with Jealouſies of a general Deſign to deſtroy them. If the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Princes and States remove not theſe Suſpitions, if they
ſuffer <hi>France</hi> ſtill to aggrandize her ſelf by her pretended Zeal
for Catholiciſm, which at the bottom is but a Mask, they may
already be aſſured, that they are loſt. It will ſignifie little to
ſay, <hi>We are good Catholicks as well as you,</hi> this will not ſecure
them from <hi>Dragoons,</hi> all that will not take the Yoke ſhall be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;
nay, worſe than an Heretick; for now the greateſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
is not to ſubmit; <hi>Spain, Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> already know this
in ſome meaſure.</p>
            <p>But it will not be thought a <hi>Paradox,</hi> if, to all that we have
ſaid, we add, That the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, and the whole Body of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, find themſelves ſenſibly intereſs'd in the
Perſecution of us. And yet we will ſay nothing herein, but
what is evident Truth, and which the wiſeſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
muſt agree to. For is it not the worſt Character that
can be given of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, to repreſent them as an Order
of Men, who not only cannot endure any thing that is not ſubject
to them in a Religious, but alſo in Civil Society; as Men that are
not content to Anathematize all that diſpleaſe them, but deſign
nothing ſo much as to exterminate them, not only to exterminate
them, but alſo to force their Conſciences, and inſpire their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
and propagate their way of Worſhip by the knocking Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Staves;</hi> as an Order of Men, who
neither Faith nor Juſtice, who promiſe only to deceive, who for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61156:23"/>
a while curb their fury only, that afterwards they may the more
inſult, that in <hi>Peace</hi> as well as <hi>War,</hi> contrive only to overturn and
deſtroy, that make Allyances only to ſurprize, and finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more powerful, deny thoſe they have ſurprized the Liberty
to eſcape. Theſe are the exact Features and Colours by which
the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy may be eaſily known, if we judge of them by
the perſecution in <hi>France,</hi> the like whereof was never ſeen to
this day: The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> once perſecuted the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
but forced them not to embrace the Worſhip of their Idols;
they contented themſelves with making them Slaves, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
violence to their Conſciences. The Heathens and the <hi>Jews</hi>
perſecuted the primitive Chriſtians, forced their Conſciences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but they had never granted them an Edict, nor by perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them did violate the publick Faith, nor hindred them to
make their eſcape by Flight. The <hi>Arrians</hi> cruelly perſecuted the
Orthodox, but beſides that, they went not ſo far, as to make the
common ſort of people ſign formal Abjurations; there was no
Edict or Concordat between the Two Communions. <hi>Innocent</hi>
the <hi>3d.</hi> by his <hi>Croyſades,</hi> perſecuted the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi>
but theſe people alſo had no Edict. <hi>Emanuel,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
perſecuted the <hi>Jews,</hi> but he gave them leave to depart out
of his Kingdom, and they had no Edict. It was the ſame with
thoſe Remains of the <hi>Moors,</hi> who had ſetled themſelves in ſome
<hi>Cantons</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> they were defeated in a War,
and commanded to retire into the <hi>Country</hi> from whence their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
came. In the laſt Age the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> exerciſed dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Cruelties</hi> upon the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Seventeen <hi>Provinces,</hi> but he
did not hinder them from flying, nor violated any Edict; and at
the worſt, death was their Releaſe. The Inquiſition is to this day
in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but they are Countries, in which no Religion,
beſides the <hi>Roman,</hi> was ever permitted by Edicts, and if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors
may be accuſed of Violence and Cruelty, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be convicted of Perfidiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>But in this laſt Perſecution of <hi>France,</hi> there are Five things that
ſtrike the Mind with horror; they make the Conſciences and
Religion of Men to depend Soveraignly upon the Will of a King,
they violate a Faith Authentickly ſworn to, they force Men to
be Hypocrites, and wicked, by ſeeming to embrace a Religion which
they abhor; they prohibit all Flights or retiring out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
they do not put to death, but preſerve Life to oppreſs it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61156:23"/>
with longer Torments. If after this the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and its
Clergy, diſperſed over the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> diſclaim not ſo odious
and ſo criminal a Conduct; if they condemn it not, it will be an
indelibel Stain to the Honour of their Religion. Not only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
who are of a different Communion, but alſo in an infinite
number of their own <hi>Catholicks,</hi> will be mightily ſcandaliz'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at:
nay, even the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> will riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt them. They may already know what they have bin
condemned of, in what paſſed in the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>John Huſs,</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> whom they put to
Death, notwithſtanding the ſafe Conduct of the Emperor <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund;</hi>
but there is ſomething greater here: There only Two
Men were concerned, here more than 1500000. thoſe they put to
Death, and if they had done the ſame to theſe, they would have
embraced their Death with Joy and Comfort. The Council
thought its Authority greater than <hi>Sigiſmund's,</hi> but there cannot
be produced one above that which has eſtabliſh'd our Edict.</p>
            <p>We are not ignorant of the different Methods which the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
take to ſhelter themſelves from publick Condemnation.
Some take a ſpeedy courſe to deny the Fact; and to perſwade
the World; <hi>That Force and Violence have had no ſhare in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
but that they were ſoft, and calm, and voluntary; and that if there
were any</hi> Dragoons <hi>concerned therein, 'twas becauſe the Reformed
themſelves deſired them, that they might have a handſom pretence to
change their Religion.</hi> Was there ever ſeen ſo much Impudence?
What will they not deny, who can deny what's done in the Face
of the Sun, and what a whole Kingdom from one end of it to
the other hath ſeen, and to this day ſees? For in the beginning of
the year 1686. whilſt I am compoſing this ſad Rehearſal, they
continue to exerciſe in <hi>France</hi> the ſame Rage, that ended the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
year, the ſame <hi>Dragoons</hi> both in Cities and Countries ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
the ſame Fury againſt ſome lamentable Remains of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
who will not fall down and worſhip.</p>
            <p>They are uſed like Rebels in their Perſons, in their Eſtates, in
their Wives, and in their Children; and if there be any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
'tis in this that their ſufferings are ſtill increaſing. Yet if
we will believe the Clergy, haranguing the King, and the Biſhop
of <hi>Valence</hi> their Speaker, he tells his Majeſty how miraculous his
Reign is, ſeeing ſuch infinite number of Converſions are made
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, without violences and Arms; much leſs,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61156:24"/>
ſaith he, <hi>by the force of your Edicts,</hi> as by the example of your
<hi>exemplary Piety.</hi> If we will believe the greateſt part of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations
which theſe poor Oppreſt People, are forc'd to make,
they ſpeak indeed the ſame ſence, <hi>viz. That they have done this
without being conſtrain'd thereto.</hi> Thus is the Credulity of the
publick impos'd on: They have Seeds of Impoſture ſown at their
Feet, which are to grow with the time. Poſterity who ſhall ſee
theſe Records, will belive they contain the truth; Here, ſay they,
is what has bin told the King, who muſt not have falſhoods offer'd
him: Here is the proper acts and deeds of thoſe that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
Why will not then Poſterity believe it, ſeeing that at
preſent, there are indeed people impudent enough, or to ſpeak
better, paid well enough to publiſh it in ſtrange Countries; and
there are found credible perſons enough to believe it. But I pray
what likelihood is there, that 150000 perſons already gone out
of <hi>France,</hi> without any thing conſtraining them to it, ſhould leave
their Houſes, their Lands of Inheritance, their Effects, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
their Wives and Children, for to wander about the World,
and lead a miſerable Life for a humour. Is there any likelihood,
that Perſons of Quality of both Sexes, who enjoyed 10, 15, 20,
30 thouſand Livers <hi>per annum,</hi> would abandon theſe their Eſtates,
not only for themſelves, but for their Succeſſors; expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the periſs, and incommodiouſneſs of long Journies, and
reduce themſelves in a manner to Beggary; which is a condition
the moſt inſupportable in the world, to Perſons of Quality; and
all this without any reaſon, without any occaſion? What likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
that this 150 thouſand perſons who have already eſcap'd,
ſome of 'em into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> others into <hi>Germany,</hi> ſome into
<hi>Denmark,</hi> others into <hi>Holland,</hi> ſome into <hi>Suedeland,</hi> and others
into <hi>England,</hi> and ſome into <hi>America,</hi> without ſeeing or knowing
one another, yet have agreed to tell the ſame lie, and to ſay with
one voice, That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are cruelly perſecuted in <hi>France;</hi>
and that by unheard of Severities they are forc'd to change their
Religion; altho' there is no ſuch matter? Is it likely that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
and Envoys of Foreign Princes, ſhould lye all of them in
conſórt, in telling them this news, wherein there is no truth? But I
pray, If in <hi>France</hi> the Proteſtants thus voluntarily, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
change their Religion, &amp; that the Dragoons are cal'd in only
as their good friends, whence happens this ſo ſtrict &amp; general Guard
on the Frontiers, to hinder Peoples departure? How is it that the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61156:24"/>
Priſons of the Kingdom are cram'd, with Fugitives ſtopt by the way?
Whence is it, that thoſe who have chang'd, are watch'd with ſuch
great care to hinder their flight; to the obliging them to depoſit
ſums of money to ſecure them from the ſuſpition of it? This
muſt be an Epidemical Diſtemper that has ſeiz'd on his Majeſties
Subjects, that ſhall make them fly thus without reaſon? But is
not this a fine cover, to ſay that the Proteſtants have themſelves
call'd in the Dragoons, to have the better pretence to change their
Religion? It is about 10 or more years ſince there was a Bankſet
up to traffick for Souls. Mr. <hi>Peliſon,</hi> has for a long time bin the
great dealer of <hi>Paris,</hi> in this infamous Trade of purchaſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts.
Theſe Converſions have of late, bin the only way of
gaining applauſe, and recompences at Court, and in a word, a
means of raiſing ones Fortune; and yet we muſt be told, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of being Converted by theſe eaſie ways, we had rather chooſe
the help of Dragoons, that is, of being pillag'd. At leaſt let any
one tell us, why ſince theſe pretended voluntary Converſions, the
People not willing to go to Maſs, they have bin obliged to ſend
them Troops, and uſe them with the ſame ſeverity as before.</p>
            <p>This is ſo groſs and palpable an untruth, that others have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to defend theſe Violences, as being naturally of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Spirit of the Catholick Church; and for this purpoſe, they
have continually in their mouths that paſſage of the Goſpel, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle
intrare,</hi> compel them to come in, and the perſecution which
the Orthodox of <hi>Africk</hi> offer'd the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Were this a place to diſpute againſt theſe furious Divines, we
could eaſily ſhow 'em the vanity of theſe allegations; but we
ſhall rather ask 'em, whether the Jews and Pagans had agreed
upon an Edict with the Apoſtles, when our Saviour ſays to
them, <hi>compel them to come in.</hi> Has St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ever written,
for he is cited in this matter, That we ought to be perfidious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thoſe whom we eſteem as Hereticks, when we promis'd to
live with 'em like Brethren and fellow Citizens. The Donatiſts,
had they any Edicts which would ſhelter 'em from the inſults of
the Orthodox? If we yield to this deteſtable Divinity, what will
become of all us Chriſtians? For in ſhort, <hi>the Papiſt is as much
an Heretick to the Proteſtants, as the Proteſtants are to the Papiſt;</hi> yet
they live together in peace, on the Faith of Alliances, Treaties
and Promiſes. But theſe publick Peſts as much as in them lies
have brought all things into confuſion, and a <hi>State of War.</hi> They
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61156:25"/>
arm the Catholicks againſt the Proteſtants, teaching the Catholicks
by this example, that their Religion obliges him to betray and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
the Proteſtants, when they can do it unpuniſh'd; and knock
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut their Brains if they will not change their Religion. They
arm the Proteſtant againſt the Catholick; for after all, what Peace,
and Society can we have with People, who not only make no
Conſcience to break their Faith; but on the contrary, make it a
caſe of Conſcience to break it, when they ſhall find occaſion.
Thus have they by their Dragoons deſolated a Kingdom, and
plunder'd above a 100 thouſand Families. Do we think this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
is pleaſing to him, whom we both own to be the Author
of our Faith; he has ſaid, <hi>That he will not ſuffer Hell Gates to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
his Church;</hi> but he has not ſaid, he will open Hell Gates for
the propagating his Church. Now if there were any thing that
looks like the Gates of Hell, it is the perſecutions of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatſoever Antipathy there may be between the See of <hi>Rome</hi>
and us, we will not believe that the preſent Pope has had any
part, or that the Storm has fallen on us from him. We know he
is a mild Prince, and his temper leads to more moderate Councils
than thoſe of his Predeceſſors. Moreover we know, the Clergy
of <hi>France</hi> do not always conſult him in what they undertake; and
we have had often offered to us, what has bin done againſt <hi>Rome,</hi>
to induce us to ſubmit our ſelves to the King's will in theſe other
matters; and how ſmall a deference is paid to its Authority. So
that we hope the Pope himſelf, conſidering us ſtill as Men and
Chriſtians, will condole us, and blame the methods uſed againſt
us, had he no other reaſon than the intereſt of Religion. <hi>Perhaps
one day, it will be our turn to blame that which will be taken againſt
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, 'tis certain the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> are the moſt

they are ſupported by the Charity of our <hi>Chriſtian Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet amongſt all theſe Afflictions we are not deſtitute of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
we, if ever any did, do truly ſuffer for Conſcience ſake; the
Malice of our <hi>Perſecutors</hi> not being able to charge us with the leaſt
Miſdemeanour. We have ſerved our King and the State with Zeal
and Faithfulneſs. We have ſubmitted to the Laws and to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates;
and for our Fellow-Citizens, they have no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of us. We have for Twenty years together ſuffered with an
unexemplary patience all thoſe furious and dreadful Storms afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.
And when in <hi>Vivaretz</hi> and <hi>Cevennes,</hi> ſome have
thought themſelves bound in Conſcience to preach on the Ruines
of their Temples illegally demoliſht, their ſmall number, which
were but a handful of Men, Women and Children, has only ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſtir up more the Reſignation and Obedience of our whole
<hi>Body.</hi> In theſe latter Storms we have been like Sheep, innocent
and without defence. We then comfort our ſelves in the Juſtice
of our Cauſe, and our peaceable <hi>Deportment</hi> under it.</p>
            <p>But we comfort our ſelves likewiſe in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Compaſſion
ſhewed us by Forrein <hi>Princes,</hi> and more eſpecially of his Majeſty
of <hi>England,</hi> who has received us into his Countries, ſuccoured
and relieved us, and recommended our diſtreſſed Condition to all
his Subjects; and we have found in them not only new Maſters, or
the Affections of new Friends, but of real <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Brethren.</hi>
And as theſe bowels of Commiſeration have been as <hi>Balm</hi> to our
Wounds, ſo we ſhall never loſe the remembrance of it, and hope
we nor our Children ſhall ever do any thing, by Gods Grace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy

            <p>All our Affliction then is, to ſee our Religion oppreſſed in the

            <p>However 'twill be no Offence to God nor Good Men to leave
this Writing to the World, as a Proteſtation made before him,
and them againſt theſe Violences; more eſpecially againſt the Edict
of 1685. containing the Revocation of that of <hi>Nants,</hi> it being
in its own Nature inviolable, irrevocable, and unalterable. We
may, I ſay, complain amongſt other things againſt the worſe than
inhumane Cruelties exerciſed on dead Bodies, when they are
drag'd along the Streets at the Horſe Tayls, and dig'd out, and
denyed Sepulchers. We cannot but complain of the Cruel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to part with our Children, and ſuffer them to be Baptized, and
brought up by our Enemies. But above all, againſt the impious
and deteſtable practiſe, now in vogue, of making Religion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

of treating perſeverance in the Faith with the odious name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion:

all preſent and to come, Greeting. King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, Our
Grandfather of Glorious Memory, deſiring to prevent, that the Peace
which he had procured for his Subjects, after the great Loſſes they had
ſuſtained, by the long continuance of Civil and Forreign Wars, might
not be diſturbed by occaſion of the pretended Reformed Religion, as it had
been during the Reigns of the Kings his Predeceſſors, had by his Edict
given at <hi>Nantes,</hi> in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1598. Regulated the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
which was to be obſerved with Reſpect to thoſe of the ſaid Religion,
the places where they might publickly exerciſe the ſame, appointed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Judges, to adminiſter Juſtice to them; and laſtly, alſo by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
diſtinct Articles provided for every thing, which he judged need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the maintenance of Peace and Tranquility in his Kingdom, and
to diminiſh the Averſion which was between thoſe of the one and other
Religion; and this, to the end that he might be in a better condition for
the taking ſome effectual courſe (which he was reſolved to do) to reunite
thoſe again to the Church, who upon ſo ſlight occaſions had withdrawn
themſelves from it. And foraſmuch as this Intention of the King, our
ſaid Grandfather, could not be effected, by reaſon of his ſuddain and
precipitated Death; and that the Execution of the foreſaid Edict was
interrupted during the Minority of the late King, Our moſt Honoured
Lord and Father, of Glorious Memory, by reaſon of ſome new Enter-priſes
of thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion, whereby they gave
occaſion for their being deprived of ſeveral Advantages which had been
granted to them, by the foreſaid Edict: Notwithſtanding, the King, Our
ſaid late Lord and Father, according to his wonted Clemency, granted
them another Edict at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> in the Month of <hi>July</hi> 1629, by means of
which the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom being now again re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the ſaid late King, being animated with the ſame Spirit and Zeal for
Religion, as the King our ſaid Grandfather was, reſolved to make
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61156:27"/>
good uſe of this Tranquility, by endeavouring to put this pious deſign
in Execution, but Wars abroad, coming on a few years after, ſo that
from the Year 1635, to the Truce which was concluded with the Princes
of <hi>Europe,</hi> in 1684. The Kingdom having been only for ſome ſhort
Intervals altogether free from troubles, it was not poſſible to do any
other thing for the advantage of Religion, ſave only to diminiſh the
number of places permitted for the Exerciſe of the Pretended Reformed
Religion, as well by the Interdiction of thoſe which were found erected
in prejudice to the diſpoſal made in the ſaid Edict, as by ſuppreſſing
the mix'd Chambers of Judicature, which were compoſed of an equal
number of Papiſts and Proteſtants, the erecting of which was only done
by Proviſion, and to ſerve the preſent Exigency.</p>
            <p>Whereas therefore at length it hath pleaſed God to grant, that Our
Subjects enjoying a perfect Peace, and We Our ſelves being no longer
taken up with the cares of protecting them againſt our Enemies, are
now in a condition to make good uſe of the ſaid Truce, which we
have on purpoſe facilitated, in order to the applying our ſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
in the ſearching out of means, which might ſucceſsfully effect
and accompliſh the deſign of the Kings, our ſaid Grandfather and
Father, and which alſo have been our intention ever ſince we came to
the Crown; we ſee at preſent (not without a juſt acknowledgment
of what we owe to God on that account) that our endeavours have
attain'd the end we propoſed to Our ſelves, foraſmuch as the greater

            <head>The Profeſſion of the Catholick, Apoſtolick, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Faith, which the Revolting Proteſtants in
France are to Subſcribe and Swear to.</head>
            <p>IN the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Amen.</hi> I Believe
and Confeſs with a firm Faith, all and every thing and things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Creed which is uſed by the Holy Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> viz I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and embrace moſt ſincerely the Apoſtolick and Eccleſiaſtical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and other Obſervances of the ſaid Church. In like manner I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Scriptures, but in the ſame ſenſe as the ſaid Mother Church
hath, and doth now underſtand and expound the ſame, for whom and to
whom it only doth belong to judge of the Interpretation of the Sacred
Scriptures; and I will never take them, nor underſtand them otherwiſe
than according to the unanimous conſent of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>I profeſs that there be truly and properly ſeven Sacraments of the
New Law, inſtituted by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and neceſſary for the
Salvation of Mankind, altho not equally needful for every one,
<hi>viz. Baptiſm, Confirmation,</hi> the <hi>Euchariſt, Penance, Extream
Unction, Orders</hi> and <hi>Marriage;</hi> and that they do confer Grace; and
that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> may not be reiterated without Sacriledge: I
receive and admit alſo the Ceremonies received and approved by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
Church in the ſolemn adminiſtration of the forementioned Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>I receive and embrace all and every thing and things which have
been determined concerning Original Sin and Juſtification by the holy
Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I likewiſe profeſs, that in the <hi>Maſs</hi> there is offered up to God, a true,
proper, and propitiatory Sacrifice for the Living and Dead; and that
in the Holy Sacrament of the <hi>Enchariſt,</hi> there is <hi>truly, really and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially,
the Body and Blood, together with the Soul and Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that in it there is made a change
of the whole ſubſtance of the Bread into his Body, and of the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Wine into his Blood, which change the Catholick Church
calls <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> I confeſs alſo, that under one only of theſe
two Elements, whole Chriſt and the true Sacrament is received.</p>
            <p>I conſtantly believe and affirm, that there is a Purgatory, and that the
Souls there detained, are relieved by the Suffrages of the Faithful.</p>
            <p>In like manner, I believe that the Saints reigning in Glory with Jeſus
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61156:30"/>
Chriſt, are to be worſhipped and invocated by us, and that they offer up
Prayers to God for us, and that their Reliques ought to be honoured.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I do moſt ſtedfaſtly avow, that the Images of Jeſus Chriſt,
of the Bleſſed Virgin the Mother of God, and of other Saints, ought to be
kept and retained, and that due Honour and Veneration muſt be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto them.</p>
            <p>Alſo I do affirm, that the power of Indulgence was left to the Church
by Chriſt Jeſus, and that the uſe there of is very beneficial to Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>I do acknowledg the holy Catholick, Apoſtolick and Roman Church,
to be the Mother and Miſtreſs of all other Churches; and I profeſs and
ſwear true obedience to the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> Succeſſor of the Bleſſed St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> Prince of the Apoſtles, and Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In like manner I own and profeſs, without doubting, all other things
left defined and declared by the Holy Canons and General Councils, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
by the moſt holy Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> and withal, I do condemn,
reject, and hold for accurſed, all things that are contrary thereto; and
all thoſe Hereſies which have been condemned, rejected, and accurſed by
the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then ſwearing upon the Book of the Goſpel, the Party recanting

death, this ſelf ſame <hi>Catholick and Apoſtolick Faith, out of which
no perſon can be ſaved;</hi> and this I do moſt truly and willingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
and that I will to the utmoſt of my Power, endeavour that
it may be maintained and upheld as far as any ways belong to my
