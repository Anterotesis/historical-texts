         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Also he must have four Balls made of Corke, about the bignesse of small Nutmegs. First hee must practise to hold these Corke Balls, two or three of them at once in one hand. The best place, and the readiest to hold one Ball, is between the ball of the thumbe, and the palme of the hand; but if you hold more then one at one time, between your fingers towards the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes. The place to hold a great Ball is between your two middle fingers; Remember in your play alwayes to keep the palme of your hand downward: After you have once learned to hold these Balls handsomely, you may worke divers strange, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull feats.</p>

               <p>Then with your right hand take up the first ball, and seeme to put it into your left hand, shutting your said left hand in due time, then as if you were at dice, cast your left hand at the cup D, and blow after it, saying, <hi>vade pas,</hi> and tis gone, then take up the cup noted A, and clap it upon the cup D, and in

               <figure/>
               <p>Then take up one ball, and seem to cast it in the aire, and staring after it, say <hi>vade,</hi> that's gone, then with your right hand take up the uppermost cup, say, see here he is crept between my cups, and in clapping it down againe, convey the ball that you retained under it.</p>

Then cover them again, and say single is nothing, then clap the third cup upon them, but double is somewhat.
<figure/>
Then may you seem to pull all the three corks out of the top of the upper cup, causing them to vanish one after another, as I have sufficiently taught you before, which may be performed by that one ball

that you retain in your right hand.</p>
               <p>And lastly, take the uppermost cup, and set it down first by it selfe, then with both hands nimbly hoisting the two other cups, shuffle them one upon another, and the balls wil not fall out, and so it will be thought that you have pulled the three bals out of the bottoms of the two uppermost cups.

But I will not stand on discovering these, for in this our couse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning age there are too many so expert herein, that they maintain themselves better than many an honest man with a lawfull trade and calling. Onely take this by the way, Those that have money in their purses, let them beware of Carding and Dicing, lest they wish they had, when it is too late. As for my own part, Ile never play for that I am sure of already: if any will play with me upon other termes I am sure I shall lose nothing by the bargain.</p>
