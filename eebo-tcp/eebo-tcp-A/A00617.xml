            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Publius Mimius: nunquam peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum ſine peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo vincitur.</note> he that ventureth not, neither looſeth nor winneth. And one danger is ſaued by the other, and after the danger commeth the profit. If any man thinke that he can put anie thing which in counſell is concluded, in execution without aduenture, he ſhall neuer be able to bring that to paſſe which he wiſheth. For it is the propertie of Fortune, to croſſe, not onelie great and heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call enterpriſes, but alſo ſmall and particular things. They ought not then to linger, but ſtraight-waies to put the ſame which in the counſell is concluded, in practiſe, though there be danger in the execution of it: if ſo be that the profit which is to folow the execution, be greater then the danger which is incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in not executing it.</p>
               <p>8 It is the propertie of wiſe men, to conſult vpon all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which they take in hand, with great deliberation: and<note place="margin">Saluſt in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telin.</note> then (as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaith) ſpéedilie with a proportioned diligence, to execute the ſame which is concluded: and not imitate y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is ſaid of the <hi>Maquedana,</hi> who ſpake without conſideration of the time and place, where and with whom ſhe ſpake. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is conuenient to conſider well of euery thing: for by how much the more things be déepelie pondered, by ſo much the more profitable are the counſels vnto the Common wealth, not onely in matters of peace, but alſo of war. And therfore in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient<note place="margin">Polidorus Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius in adagiis.</note> times paſt, it was wont to be ſaid, that the <hi>Romaines</hi> did ouercome ſitting: and that counſell is taken on the pillow, and that many counſels amend all matters.</p>
               <p>9 It falleth out very ſildome, that they which haue deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to doo any thing, leaue and giue ouer the dooing of it,<note place="margin">Prouerb. 11.</note> though the execution thereof be difficult and dangerous: and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2048:11"/>
manie becauſe they would not be hindered, and kept from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame in execution which they purpoſe to doe, wil aſke no aduiſe, nor admit any one to counſell them: who (as they know) will not allow that which they will haue. For it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth<note place="margin">Lotimus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderat. 330.</note> vnto them, that their minds that ſhould helpe them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the ſame which they pretend, ſaint: and they feare, that if they ſhould conſult with them, vpon that which they haue before alreadie determined, it would be an occaſion to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to execute the ſame which they wiſh. Such men are very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vnto the Common-wealth. And if that before they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with themſelues to folow theyr pretences, they had conſulted vpon that which they ought to doe: they might eaſily be brought from dooing that, which they pretended: daſhing (as the royall Prophet ſaith) the children of <hi>Babilon</hi> on the ſtones, not ſuffering naughty and peruerſe pretences to grow. Theſe be the children of <hi>Babilon,</hi> which the kingly Prophet ſaith, that<note place="margin">Pſalme. 136.</note> they ought to be broken on the ſtone. The ſtone whereon they ſhould be broken, is our Redéemer and Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whoſe fauour and grace, all naughtie and wicked imaginations are broken.</p>
               <p>10 After that the ſame is begun to be executed, which in<note place="margin">Lotimus conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat. 331.</note> the counſell was determined, the Counſellers muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member or think of that counſell, which they forſooke, that the execution of the ſame be not hindered, which is already deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. For they muſt hold that firme and ſtable, which in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell is agréed vpon, and thinke it to be moſt profitable to the Common-wealth: for it is very hurtfull to the execution, to thinke that thoſe counſels which they would not folow, were better then thoſe which they approoued. And indéed it is the propertie of vnfortunate perſons, (as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> ſaith)<note place="margin">Cornelius Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus. Lib. 1.</note> to thinke that, that counſell which they folowed not, was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſafer then that which they alowed and approoued.</p>
               <p>11 When the matters which are in counſell, are of ſuch condition and qualitie, that they may be redreſſed at all times, then may the Counſellers ſpend much time in deliberating what may be doone: for that thing is not ſaid to be doone out of time, which may be doone in any time. But contrariwiſe, if the matters require haſt, and a ſpéedie concluſion, then ought the Counſellers to make much of the time, and with as great
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2048:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
celeritie and ſpéed as may be, conclude and determine. For it is very hurtfull to thoſe things which the Counſellers ſit vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Lucan. Lib. 1. Cor.

For whilſt the Counſellers are conſulting what is to be doone, the occaſion paſſeth which was offered, to put the ſame in execution which was determined. <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Dec. 3. lib. 3.</note> that in meane ſpace, while the <hi>Romaines</hi> conſulted what ſuccor they ſhould ſend, to the Towne <hi>Saguntia</hi> beeing beſieged with <hi>Hanibals</hi> Armie: it might haue béene taken, deſtroied, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the ground.

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:2048:14"/>3 And Princes to the ende they may be well counſelled, ſhould commaund their Counſellers to ſpeake freelie in theyr conſultations, and ſhew their minds what they thinke ought to be determined to doo the Common-wealth good. For (as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanus</hi> ſaid to king <hi>Xerxes</hi>) if there be not diuers minds and<note place="margin">Herodorus. lib. 7.</note> opinions in their conſultations, how can the Prince chooſe that which is beſt. After the ſame order as we know which is the better gold, by laying of one péece of gold to the other: euen ſo, comparing one counſell with the other, the Princes diſcerne which of them is moſt profitable for the Common-wealth. And (as <hi>Paulus de Caſtro</hi> ſaith) euen as perſumes, the better they<note place="margin">Conſilio 13. lib. 1 Conſilio.</note> be beaten, the ſweeter they ſmell: ſo likewiſe, the ſentences, minds, and opinions of Counſellers, the more they be debated and diſcuſſed, the ſurer and better they be. True it is, that the rareſt and greateſt wits, béeing of ſingular iudgment, are able to enter déeper into matters, then they that are not ſo wittie, but of the ſimple ſort. And they that are fullie experienced, can better diſcerne what is neceſſaire in euery matter, then they which haue no ſkill in it. Yet neuertheleſſe, it is the dutie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerie wiſe man, to heare the minds of many, for one man one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, cannot ſee and know all things.

               <p>4 It is a thing very hurtfull to the Common-wealth, that the Counſellers before hand ſhould knowe their Princes incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for then they ſéeke all means poſſible how to find out reaſons, which may iuſtifie and prooue that which their King or Prince deſireth.

The Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, was wont to ſay, that it became Princes very well, to be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with learned men: and that the ſocietie and vſe of learned men, was very expedient and profitable vnto vertuous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and contrarilie, very dangerous and hurtful to wicked and lewde Princes. For to euevy thing which the Prince will doo, they find either n Law or an Hiſtory to allow and approoue the ſame. And if ſo be that the Prince be of weake iudgment, he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2048:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will not be able to determine and chooſe, what is moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Common-wealth. It is manifeſt, that the Emperor ſaid true, ſéeing that there neuer wanted men of great learning, who contrarie to all reaſon and iuſtice, iuſtified and approoued that which their Prince purpoſed and appointed to doo. As alſo the Emperors which perſecuted our Chriſtian Religion, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not learned Counſellers to allow and approoue their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked enterpriſes. <hi>Vlpian</hi> the Lawyer, wrote the manner how<note place="margin">Lactantius Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus lib. 5. cap. 10.</note> they ſhould torment and puniſh the Chriſtians.

Such Counſellers are not to be termed <hi>Iuriſperiti,</hi> and <hi>Juriſconſulti,</hi> but rather <hi>Jureperditi,</hi> and <hi>Iureſtulti.</hi> Certes, they that glorie, and vant that they be Chriſtians, ought to be aſhamed to doe that which <hi>Papinian</hi> being a Pagan would not<note place="margin">Cagnolus in procemio diga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorum, 9, Itaque. in 131.</note> doe, although he was commaunded by the Emperor <hi>Caracalla,</hi> (whoſe Steward and familiar he was) to doo it: which was, to defend an vniuſt cauſe.

And he eſteemed more (as our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Jeſus<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> teacheth vs) not to offend God, then he did of thoſe that kil the bodie, but not the ſoule. Thoſe learned men that iuſtifie falſe things vnto their Princes, diſcharge not their dueties as they are bound to doe: for they perſwade them to doo many thinges that redound to the Common-wealths vtter deſtruction.</p>
               <p>5 A Prince then ought to ſelect ſuch Counſellers, as doe not approoue all that which be ſaith: for that is the cheefe and principall tricke of flatterie, to allow all that is ſaid, and ſtill to ſing, <hi>Et cum ſpiritu tuo.</hi> Such men (as the <hi>Italians</hi> ſay) iourney ſtill betwixt <hi>Lodi &amp; Placentia:</hi> they neuer goe to <hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE counſels are the foundation, whereon all Common-wealths be grounded. For whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is conuenient to be doone for the profit of the Common-wealth, is decided in them. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> there be fiue counſels which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie<note place="margin">Rhet. lib. 1.</note> Common-wealth that is well gouerned ought to haue. The firſt is of reuenewes: in this counſell they conſult vpon rents, as well ordinary as extraordinarie: and vpon ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expences, how the rents are ſpent and conſumed. This counſell is very neceſſarie in a Common-wealth, for ſubſtance is the <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> as wel in publike as priuate affaires, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, neither men nor Common-wealths can fitly be maintained. For little profit the foure Elements, and al other mixtures whatſoeuer, if men haue not wherwithal to buy ſuch things, as are neceſſarie to their maintenance and ſuſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as I wrote more at large, in the Treatiſe which I made, of the crafts and fetches wherwith men attaine to riches. The ſecond counſell is of peace: and this commonly is called the counſell of eſtate, on which the whole gouernment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is grounded: as I write more at large beneath. The third counſell is of warre: vnto this counſell it belongeth to looke to the fortifying of places, and maintenance of men, and what Souldiers are neceſſary for warres, and the defence of the Common-wealth, and manie other matters concerning the ſame. The fourth counſell is, of ſuch prouiſion and maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce as is neceſſary to the Common-wealth. This hath charge to prouide &amp; furniſh the Common-wealth, with mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and other thinges neceſſarie to life, in time of peace or warre. The fift counſell is for the Lawes and iuſtice. In this counſell all things are handled that pertaine and belong to the Prince, as well in ciuill as in criminall matters: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame may be there determined, which the Prince according to right<note place="margin">In tractatu de conſilio &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiliariis princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum.</note> and iuſtice, (if he were preſent) ſhould ordaine by what order of iuſtice ſoeuer. <hi>Fredericus Furius</hi> calleth this the counſell of puniſhments: vnto this is that referred which is determined
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2048:16"/>
in the Chaunceries: if the parties pleading complaine, that the Judges of the Chaunceries doo not iudge well and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable vnto iuſtice. To which alſo, it belongeth to haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, what Offices, charges, Magiſtrates and Gouernours are neceſſary for the gouernment of the Common-wealth: and what, and how much authority and power they ought to haue: this counſell ſhall adde ſuch Officers as are wanting, and put downe ſuch as are ſuperfluous. It pertaineth alſo vnto this, to declare and expound ſuch Lawes as haue a doubtful ſence, and take away ſuch as are hurtfull to the Common-wealth, and make ſuch newe as are neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>2 Unto theſe fiue counſels which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſets down, <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericus Furius</hi> addeth the ſixth: of gifts and rewards. This counſell hath charge to heare, and learne, the merits &amp; deſerts generally of all: béeing enformed of the life, manners, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and déeds of thoſe, that not aſking any reward, deſerue to be rewarded for their vertues. And particularly of thoſe that aſke ſome rewards. A reward is properly called that, which is giuen to doo good vnto him to whom it is giuen. For that which is giuen, to get and obtaine ſome thing of him, vnto whom it<note place="margin">Seneca lib. 1. de benefici. cap. 6.</note> is giuen, is not properlie a reward, but a contract or bargaine: ſéeing it is betwéene two parties that haue to doo with debt and receit. And ſuch reward, is rather to be ſet in reckoning bookes, which Merchants call bookes of account, then in the booke of rewards. The Common-wealth that is well gouerned, hath great néede of this counſell of rewards: that each one may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and doo his beſt, to conſerue and augment it: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inticeth, and ſtirreth vp men to labour, whereas no man (as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaith) wold be good, if he hoped not for ſome reward.<note place="margin">Nemo gratis bonus eſt.</note> King <hi>Nabuchadnezzor</hi> had bookes, in which he commaunded the ſeruice that was doone him to be written, to reward them that ſerued him.</p>
               <p>3 Although <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Fredericus Furius</hi> ſet down the counſels which are neceſſarie in a Common-wealth, after that order as we haue ſaid: yet it ſéemeth that the principall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and on which the Common-wealth doth chéefly depend, is the counſell of eſtate. For in that counſell, that, is appointed and ordayned, which is to be doone in all the other counſels. This did the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> commend vnto the Conſuls, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2048:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they ſhould haue a regard that the Common-wealth ſhold take no harme. The power which the Dictator had, differed from the power which was giuen to the Conſuls: in this, that the Dictator, was ſuperiour to all the Magiſtrates, and as long as<note place="margin">Saluſt in Catelin Videant Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, nequid detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti reſpub. capiat: et poteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas per Senatum more Romano magiſtratui max ima permittitur.</note> his dictatorſhip continued, he was abſolute King. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls could not commaund any Cittizen to be put to death, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Senate approued it. Beſides alſo theſe counſels, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Fredericus Furius</hi> ſet downe, two others are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to haue the Common-wealth well gouerned. The one of Cenſure or Manners, as the <hi>Romaines</hi> had, that none might be ſuffered in the Common-wealth to offend publiquelie, and ſo diſquiet and ſlaunder her: and that all ſuch as doo commit anie offence openly, might not remaine vnpuniſhed: as I wrote more at large in the Treatiſe of decrées concerning manners. The other of Religion, or Inquiſition: for no Common-welth can be maintained or augmented, if there be not a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Religion and worſhipping of God had in it, to maintain and uphold it: as I ſhew more at large in the ſmall diſcourſe of this booke.</p>
               <p>4 All theſe Counſels are reduced (as <hi>Phillippus de la Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> ſaith) vnto flue: viz. The firſt, vnto the counſell of warre.<note place="margin">Cap. 9. de Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutione Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani principis.</note> The ſecond, vnto the counſell of iuſtice. The third, vnto the counſell of eſtate. The fourth, vnto the counſell of mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or handicrafts Officers: and the fift, to the counſell of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This is gathered out of that, which the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith: That God might puniſh the people of Iſrael for the ſins which they committed, by taking away the valiant and hardie men, that are experienced in matters concerning warre: the Judges that miniſter iuſtice: the Prophets and Elders, that haue authoritie to giue counſell: the handicrafts men, that are ſkilfull in that which they profeſſe: and the learned men that can declare the miſteries of God. In this, God ſheweth vnto vs, how neceſſary theſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels are to euery Common-wealth. For if they haue not theſe counſels, &amp; be not gouerned as they ought, great confuſion and diſcord muſt neceſſarily folow after. It is therefore required, that the Counſellers of Princes, vſe all the diligence they poſſibly can, in looking to the publique and common profit: ſéeing that they be the verie gates and doores, through which all good &amp; ill entereth into the Common-wealth.</p>

But I meane not heare to repeate it, ſeeing that ſuch ſubtilties are fitter to be diſputed of in Schooles, then to be treated of, in counſels of Princes.</p>
               <p>2 Thoſe counſels are naught, in which is conſulted, howe to bring wicked and vnlawfull things to paſſe: and thoſe are bad counſels alſo, in which vnlawfull meanes are ſought, to put that in practiſe which is lawfull and honeſt. Therfore it is méet and conuenient, that they who deliberate and conſult vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on matters, doo enquire, not onely whether the beginning and meanes, wherwith they will accompliſh that which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell is determined, but alſo, whether the end of it be good and lawfull. Folowing this rule: they that goe about ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which of it ſelfe is contentious and ſlaunderous, ought not to regard the preſent occaſion which is offered to aduaunce it, but to conſider, whether the ende be like to be good or naught. Beſides, they ought not to allow anie bad and diſhoneſt thing, though of it come good and lawfull things. According to that, <hi>Non ſunt procuranda mala, vt eueniant bona.</hi> King <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſt. 19.</note> That he that is haſtie to giue credit, is lightly minded, and ſhal

neuer proſper. For he that raſhly takes a thing in hand, before he haue throughly conſidered it, is an enemie to good counſell. The glorious Apoſtle S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> doth exhort vs, that we ſhould not beléeue euery ſpirit, nor be mooued with euery winde: but<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4.</note> try the ſpirit whether it be of God. This is known eyther by the end vnto which it tendeth, or by the meanes by which it is aduaunced, or by the affections which mooue vs to doo it. If it be cléere, that neither the glory of God, nor the edifying of the<note place="margin">Dempſt. Epiſt. 1.

For (as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith) that voice that perſwadeth any thing that offendeth God, is the<note place="margin">Super. Math. 4.</note> voice of the deuill. As it is ſéene by the temptations wherwith he tempted our Redéemer &amp; Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the Deſerts, ſaying: that he ſhould worſhippe him, and caſt himſelfe downe from the Pinacle. But the voice of God is that, which encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth and perſwadeth vs to the ſame which he commaundeth vs.</p>
               <p>3 Although ſometimes thoſe things, which with great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are deliberated and conſulted vpon, and in which lawful meanes are vſed to put them in practiſe, haue not the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and euent which was hoped for, (for the counſails of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune as <hi>Latinus Paccatus</hi> ſaith, are very ſecrete: or rather, to ſay better, becauſe the iudgments of God as S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth: are vnſearchable, &amp; no man knoweth nor vnderſtandeth them.)<note place="margin">Roma. 11.

               <p>4 As touching olde men, <hi>Fredericus Furius</hi> would haue,<note place="margin">Vbi ſupra.</note> that thoſe which are aboue thréeſcore yéeres of age, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home vnto their houſes, liue in reſt &amp; quietnes, diſcharge their conſciences, and thinke how they may die well. He wold alſo haue, that the Princes ſhould according to the cuſtome of <hi>Rome,</hi> giue them honors, priuiledges, preferments, prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, penſions, and rents, according to euery ones deſerts: as vnto them that are diſcharged from publique affaires, not admitting them to their counſels. For when they be once paſt the ſixtith yere, their memory faileth, their vnderſtanding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth, their experience turneth into ſtubbornnes and obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, their naturall heate is but little, and therefore they let oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſlip béeing offered, their thoughts be wearied, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not trauel, and to conclude, ſuch men are an impediment and charge to the Court. But to returne to the purpoſe, ſéeing that the vertue and gift of counſelling well, commeth not from age, but from wit, iudgment, and wiſedom that euery one hath: we ought not ſo much to reſpect the age of men, as their abilitie, which is knowne by their words and déeds.

               <p>8 The fourth qualitie which King <hi>Salomon</hi> would haue a<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſt. 30.</note> Counſeller to haue, is, that when he counſelleth he ſhould not be ſorrowfull: for a troubled and greeued minde, drieth the bones (as king <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) and therefore much more the<note place="margin">Prouerb, 17.</note> fleſh, and the blood. And a mans mind béeing vexed with gréefe, is obfuſcated and darkned with the paſſions which he ſuffereth, ſo that he cannot vnderſtande and iudge well of that which is counſelled. The people of <hi>Parthia,</hi> to ſhunne this inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, did conſult of that they had to doo, in banquets. For ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bindeth mans vnderſtanding, and for this cauſe this is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Spayne</hi> for a common prouerbe: <hi>Mal ſe cura de ſuentura contriſtura:</hi> that is, ſorrow cannot launce away our miſchance. For after that ſome miſ-fortune is happened, all the ſorrowe that a man can haue will not remedie it.</p>
               <p>9 The fift qualitie is, that the counſell ought to be well<note place="margin">Prouerb, 11.</note> thought of, and as it is ſaid, vpon the pillow. For that counſell<note place="margin">Seneca in Libro de benefi. velox conſilium ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur paenitentia.</note> which is not well toſſed and tumbled in our minde, bringeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance with it: for the more matters are conſidered &amp; way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the better they be vnderſtood: and both haſte and anger, are contrarie to deliberation and conſultation. And therefore it is<note place="margin">Secundae curae ſapientiores. Nouerca conſilij praecipitatio. Lib. 22.

The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philoſophers ſay, that dogges be borne blinde, becauſe the damme maketh haſte to whelpe them. It falleth out ſomtimes that men aſke counſell of their freendes, concerning matters which require ſuch ſpeed, that it lieth vpon their liues, credite,<note place="margin">Canis feſtinans caecos parit ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulos Eraſmus in Adagijs.

King <hi>Salomon</hi> counſaileth vs, to let our eyes behold the right, and let our eye lids direct our<note place="margin">Prouer. 4, 25</note> way before vs: and ſo ſhall we not goe vnaduiſedly about that which we doo, before we haue conſulted and deliberated vpon<note place="margin">In lib. cui titul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dux itinerant.</note> it. And vnto this (as the reuerend Father <hi>Ludouicus Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis</hi> ſaith) fiue things are neceſſarilie required.

For though it be profitable to heare the opinion and mindes of manie, to knowe the matter throughly: yet it ought to be committed but to ſewe, and thoſe very ſelect and choſen men, to be determined and concluded. For if there were too manie, they might eaſily erre by reaſon of the diuerſitie of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Fourthly, to take time in deliberating vpon the matter, and let the counſaile ripen a few daies. For as by continuance of time we are better acquainted with mens manners, ſo are we alſo with counſels and determinations: and that which at the beginning liked vs very well, afterward beeing well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is altogether miſliked. Fiftly and laſtlie, to take heede of foure Mothers in Lawe which the vertue Prudence hath.

                  <p>18 <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that the facultie of the mind, in which<note place="margin">Politic. libro 1. cap. 3.</note> counſelling conſiſteth, is not perfect in bond-men, and alſo that it is but weake and ſmall in women. But this is to be taken generally and not particularly: for though it be moſt true, that ſeruitude doth oppreſſe the faculties of the mind, and that they be perfect in the ſame man when he is deliuered from bondage,<note place="margin">Dialog. 6. de Reſpubli.</note> (for as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> ſaie, ſeruitude cauſeth a man to looſe his vnderſtanding) yet neuertheles, there be many bond-men that are endued with ſinguler and perfect wit: as may be ſéene in many counſels which diuers ſeruants haue giuen to theyr Lords: which I haue ſet down in my Booke of craftie and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent counſels. <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> ſaith, that it is ſafer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Libro, 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

ſuſpect that ſeruants counſel them in matters concerning their own profit, little regarding that which is conuenient for theyr<note place="margin">Perſius Mille hominum ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. &amp;c.</note> Lords. No man can deny, but that ſéeing mens wits are verie vnlike and diuers, ſome of them be purified in aduerſitie, as gold in the fire, (for vertue as S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, is made perfect by aduerſitie,) and others contrarily, by miſaduenture and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities<note place="margin">1.

And not onely men haue more iudgment and vnderſtanding when they be fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then they haue béeing perſecuted and purſued: but alſo in brute beaſtes we may ſée the difference which they haue being much made of, and when they be miſliked of by their Lordes: yea and in one ſelfe ſame man if he fall into captiuity. For bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and captiuitie doe ſo vexe and diſturbe their wits that are croſſed with miſ-fortune, that he which was frée being brought into ſeruitude, ſeemeth not to be the ſame man. The ciuill * Lawes determine, that fortune many times maketh them<note place="margin">L. quod attinet. ff. de regulis iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, quod attinet ad ius Ciuile ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uj pro nullis ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentur.</note> bond-men, whom nature made frée, and maketh them frée who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nature made ſlaues and bond-men: but according to the lawe of nature, he that knoweth and vnderſtandeth leaſt, ought to ſerue and obey him that vnderſtandeth moſt. <hi>Plato, Diogines</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> though they were brought in captiuitie and made bond-men, yet loſt they not their vnderſtanding. But rather (as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith) <hi>Plato,</hi> though he was a Captiue, yet was<note place="margin">1. Epiſtol. ad.

As I wrote more at large in the Treatiſe which I made of good education &amp; bringing vp of youth. Though the Lawes of nature commaunde, that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt and vnſkilfull men, ſhoulde obey and ſerue thoſe that are learned and ſkilfull, and they that can doo leſſe vnto them that can doe more: yet we ſée commonly, that cowards rule &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund valiant men: ignorant and vnſkilful men, haue the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie ouer learned men: and vertuous and good men, are ſubiect to lewde and wicked perſons: as <hi>Appollonius Thianeus</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, vnto one that aſked him what he had ſeene in trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling through the world.</p>

Out of that which we haue hetherto ſaid, is gathered, that to affirme that vniuerſally (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth) which ought to be verified and prooued particularly, is rather to take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſpute and ſéeke reaſons to argue, then to ſhewe howe a man may know whither they that are to giue counſell, haue thoſe qualities which in Counſellers are required. For Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers for the moſt part, depend vpon the occaſions and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and are as remedies that are applyed vnto diſeaſes, which are not cured in the abſtract, but in the ſubiect in which they be: (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe ſaith) and the Counſellers be<note place="margin">Medicina non curat hominem ſed Socratem.

And for this cauſe it is ſaide, that the handes of the Phiſition and

And as the applicatiue doth depende vpon the iudgment and ſkill that euery one hath: ſo in matters touching counſel, the abilitie which euery one hath, is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. For (as <hi>Euſtachius</hi> ſaith) the generall and vniuerſall rules are not ſufficient enough, to haue each particular thing gouerned by them: and much leſſe Common-weales, in which commonly concurre many very diuers &amp; contrary circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which cannot be comprehended vnder the vniuerſal rules.</p>
                  <p>20 <hi>Fredericus Furius</hi> ſaith, that the Counſellers of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<note place="margin">Vbi ſupra.</note> ought to be ſkilfull in many things, but eſpeciallie in thoſe languages that are ſpoken in thoſe Prouinces that are vnder their Princes gouernment, or be their confederats or friends. For very ſeldome ſhal one méete with an Interpreter, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth and expoundeth the interpretation of a thing perfectlie, without wreſting, turning, taking away, adding, changing and altering the ſence, after many and diuers manners.

It is required in Counſellers that trauaile in forraine Regions, to be well informed bothe of the gouernment of peace &amp; war in euery Country: of ordinary things, and extraordinary things: of the loue the King beares vnto his Subiects, and howe his vaſſailes are affected among themſelues: of the ſtrong Forts &amp; Caſtles: and of the humors and qualities of the men. Many are of opinion, that by great trauailing from home, they can attaine to wiſedome &amp; humane prudence, but that is nothing ſo: for that is not gotten by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into farre Countreyes, or by liuing an exile farre from home, but by communication and conuerſation with wiſe men.

                  <p>22 <hi>Fredericus Furius</hi> would haue, that Counſellers of Princes ſhould knowe, what forces and power their Princes haue, and theyr Confederats, Freends, and Neighbours: for as the Phiſition, the firſt thing he conſidereth in mans bodie, is, what vertue and ſtrength it hath, and how much it is able to take, euen ſo a Prince his Counſeller, ought to know what forces, and howe great power his Prince hath, and thoſe that are his Friends and Confederates, that he may be able to cure the whole body of the Common-welth: and that in curing the one part, he hurt not the other, as if a Phiſition to heale one member, ſhould harme the other. <hi>Fredericus Furius</hi> ſaith, that the Counſeller of a Prince, ought to be a vertuous, vpright, and iuſt man: for ſuch a man loueth to giue euery man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſerts. Which is, to puniſh thoſe that offend, and reward thoſe that doo well, and in all things he obſerueth due moderation: for in puniſhing he is not cruell or ſlack, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding ſcarce or exceſſiue, or vaine and to no purpoſe. Neither dooth he puniſh men more then their faults deſerue, nor make all faultes equall, as the <hi>Stoickes</hi> doe, nor diſſemble with mens offences, to turne the puniſhment with which the Lawes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the offendourr, to theyr owne profit by taking brybes, as <hi>Dioniſius</hi> King of <hi>Sicil</hi> did, and they now a dayes doo, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordaine Lawes with which they may rob and ſpoyle the people.

A Princes Counſeller ought to be francke &amp; liberall, for the people is greatly pleaſed with francknes, and loueth liberalitie, yea and admireth it. But the couetous man, is alwaies deteſted, and abhorred: for he dooth all for money, and to fulfill his greedines, ſetteth all things to ſale, nay, he dooth not ſo much as ſpeake without intereſt, and is ready to committe any treaſon whatſoeuer, ſo he be no looſer by it. <hi>Saluſt</hi> writeth, that <hi>Iugurtha</hi> going out of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaid: O

This vertue conſiſteth not in giuing of money, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing any of their ſubſtance or riches as liberalitie doth: but in helping the Common-wealth, and ayding each member of it, with good counſell: admoniſhing, warning, aduertiſing, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and diſpraiſing, and fauouring by their authority and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, not onely thoſe that craue fauour, aide, helpe, or ſuccor of them, but thoſe alſo that deſerue it without aſking.

They that are Melancholicke, as they are by nature ſorrowfull, and of the ſelfe ſame complexion as the earth: ſo they be ruſticall, baſe, and heauie, ſcarce able to lift themſelues one handfull aboue the ground, vaine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in trifles, enemies to noble thoughts, malicious, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious: in ſo much that men of this complexion, haue wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and vtterly ſpoyled all the Regions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, with their dreames, fooliſh imaginations, and vaine viſions.

                     <hi>Fredericus Furius</hi> wold haue, that the Counſeller of a Prince ſhould be of meane ſtature and thicknes, for extremitie in the proportion or bignes of the bodie, ſéemeth ill in a Counſeller, and diminiſheth his authoritie. For of ouermuch greatnes, all Philoſophers and Aſtronomers conclude, that knowledge and wiſedom, be ſeldome ſéene in a man that is very hie, eſpecially,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2048:33"/>
if he be very weake: and therefore it is ſaid, that a long weak man, is lazie and ignorant. As for them that be very ſhort and lowe, there is not ſo much want of gouernment in them, as in ouer-tall men, but onely this, that they be angry and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: and the people mocketh them, and maketh no account of them. Therfore a Counſeller ought not to be, neither too long, nor too thicke, for there is no body but he will laugh, when he doth ſée one man like a Barrell, and another like a Conger. To conclude, talenes or ſhortnes, ſo the meane proportion that all men commonly are of, be not notably excéeded, hinder not the iudgement &amp; prudence which is required in Counſellers. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle men (as the Author of the fiftie Sonnets ſaith) often times are endued with brauer gifts then others, as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind. <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Tideus</hi> ſaith, that he was little of body, but yet very valiant.

                  <p>Finallie, it is well knowne, that men meaſure not their length by ſpannes, to know by the meaſure of their bodies, what wit, iudgment and abilitie they haue.</p>
                  <p>25 The ſufficiencie of a Counſeller, as concerning his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (as <hi>Fredericus Furius</hi> writeth) is the naturall proportion, conformitie, &amp; perfection of his members, that nothing be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or ſuperfluous: for either of theſe two faultes, ſhew verie ill tokens of the mind, and alſo offendeth the ſight of thoſe that looke vpon him. The proportion of all the parts of the body, is an agréeing and equalitie of each member, the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The deformitie is quite contrarie, when the members of a mans body are vnequall, one arme longer then the other, one hand ſmall and the other thicke, one ſhoulder hie and the other lowe, and ſo other members ſome greater then the other. The perfections of the parts in mans bodie, is, when he is borne wanting neuer a part or member, and without any fault in any of them. As to growe crooked, to haue a crooked backe, lame, or without ſome arme or foote, by reaſon of the ſcarcitie or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fluitie of the matter. For (according as all naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers prooue, and eſpecially <hi>Gallen</hi>) they that be ſo borne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue tenne thouſande lacks and defects in their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, manners, and life. It is ſaid, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vſed this Poeſie, <hi>God deliuer me from a man marked by

nature.</hi> To haue one foote, arme, or eye leſſe, or one member bigger then the other, doth not (as we haue ſaid) hinder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wit, iudgment and wiſedome which is required in Counſellers, for we obſerue not thoſe qualities in a Counſeller, which we doo in a bond-ſlaue when we buy one: but the abilitie which he hath to giue counſell, &amp; the diſcourſe which he is able to make in the counſels. <hi>Fredericus Furius</hi> would haue alſo, that a Counſeller ſhould be fayre and wel fauoured, for they that are endued with that grace, for that gift onely they are beloued and honoured. Therefore it is neceſſarie, that a Counſellers head be well fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned, rounde, not ſharpe in the vpper end, nor very big, nor<note place="margin">In problemat. particula, 10 pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem. 3. Conciliator de prob. 3. deff. 76.</note> very little. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that they which haue little heads, are more prudent then they that haue great heads: if theyr heads be little in ſuch ſort, that the inward parts of the head be not wanting or diminiſhed. As for the proportion of the face, that ought to be ſome-thing flatter then round, not great, nor round, nor loden with fleſh, nor little: the fore-head large or meanely, not little, nor repreſenting gréefe or ſorrow: the eies of meane bignes, not too big, nor too little, cleere, not rowling, ſtedfaſt, not heauie, nor without reſt: the noſe large and thin, not ſhort nor turned vpwards: the lips, ſome-thing thicke, not very ſmall, falling ſome-thing downwards. Finally, <hi>Frederi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Furius</hi> would haue, that a Counſeller ſhould be comely, well fauoured, ciuill, and of good behauiour. No man can deny, but that the beautie of the face, is a rare and meruailous gift of nature, and in which ſhee worketh moſt artificiallie: as I wrote more at large in my bookes of Diuine, humane, &amp; chaſte loue. Where I ſet downe the qualities which a Gentlewoman ought to haue to be fayre. And much leſſe can any man denie, but that thoſe counſels that are accompanied with comlineſſe and beautie, are more acceptable then thoſe counſels, which are giuen by an vncomely man, and ſuch an ill fauoured fellowe as hath no grace. For if he that counſaileth be faire, his beautie doth procure, that his reaſons perſwade with more ſpeede and ſeleritie, as <hi>Lucane</hi> ſaith:

                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:2048:34"/>But becauſe counſelling conſiſteth cheefely in the wit, iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wiſedom which the Counſeller hath: we ought more to regard the Counſellers prudence then his beautie: for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the fayrer men be, the leſſer wit and iudgment they be thought to haue: therefore they be called fayre beaſtes or fine pictures, that be caried in ſhew on ſolemne daies.

                  <p>26 Counſellers, as <hi>Fredericus Furius</hi> ſaith, ought to haue an excellent and rare wit: for a ready and braue wit, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, meanes, and end, of hautie and heroicall enterpriſes. Yet wit onely (as we haue ſaid) is not enough to iudge which<note place="margin">Plato dialogo. 6. de Repub.</note> of thoſe things that are conſulted ought to be doone, and which to be omitted, for this is belonging to wiſedome, and we ought more to reſpect, that the Counſellers of Princes be wiſe, then wittie, rich, or noble. For (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) it is the poynt of<note place="margin">In Alcibiad. 1.</note> wiſe men to giue good counſell, &amp; not of thoſe that be welthie. And the Angell being demaunded by <hi>Tobias</hi> of what Tribe he<note place="margin">Tobit. 5. 11.</note> was, anſwered vnto him: Dooſt thou ſéeke a ſtocke or familie, or an hired man to goe with thy Sonne? Though the vertue of counſelling well, conſiſteth more in wiſedome then in wealth, or nobilitie: yet it is ſuppoſed, that Gentlemen and rich men, are commonly better brought vppe and inſtructed then others, and that they doo better vnderſtand and know, what is belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the gouernment of the Common-wealth, then men of baſe linage and ſmall ſubſtance. And to put the counſell and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Common-wealth, in the power of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaltie, were to take the eyes out of the head, and place them

For ſuch perſons, fearing to looſe their goods, wold not counſell that which were profitable for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.

It concerneth euery Prince to haue ſuch perſons in his ſeruice, as put all their hope in him, and altogether depend vpon him: that euen as thoſe which paſſe ouer the Seas in ſome ſhippe, looke vnto the ſame ſhip leaſt they ſhould looſe their owne liues and ſubſtaunce, ſo they that counſell Princes, if their life and all their liuings conſiſt in the Prince his welfare, they wil giue him counſell with greater diligence &amp; care.

The third ſort is, of thoſe perſons, that neither know of themſelues what is beſt, nor yet will learne of others, nor ſubmitte themſelues vnto the iudgment of thoſe that be more wiſe, refuſing to followe good counſaile when it is giuen vnto them.

For it is ſuppoſed to be commaunded by him, ſéeing that he hath all the power to commaund, and ordains that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth had. This dooth not hold, if that which the Prince commaundeth be notoriouſly wicked and vniuſt. For in ſuch<note place="margin">Acts. 5.</note> matters, we ought rather to obey GOD, then men.

               <p>27 The Counſellers of the counſell of the eſtate, are to be preferred before Counſellers of other counſels, when counſell is taken vpon matters concerning that counſell: for they haue a care ouer the whole Common-wealth, and doo more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly repreſent the perſon of the Prince.

                  </gap> a great deale more harme, then they doo with the ſinne which they commit, for no man dareth to tell them the trueth. For which thing, we are much beholding to Dame Flatterie, who preuaileth ſo greatlie with Princes, that the ſame which out of all queſtion is good, is miſliked, and the ſame which is notoriouſly knowne to be naught and wicked, is allowed and approoued.</p>
               <p>Princes are now of long time accuſtomed to heare falſe tales, and to be flattered, and to haue all, whatſoeuer they ſay and doo, allowed and praiſed: that the greateſt Monſter which can be ſhewed to a Prince, is to tell him ſome true thing which offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him, as if he had neuer ſeene or heard any ſuch thing. And this is the cauſe wherfore Monſters offend, for if they had béen ſéene, they had neuer offended.</p>
               <p>4 Princes then, ſeeing howe neceſſarie it is, that they ſhould haue vertuous and learned men in their ſeruice, which might counſell and ſhew them, how they ought to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the people which is committed to their charge: ought to conſider, that both the credite and diſcredite of their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of all their Subiects alſo, dependeth vpon the election of their Counſellers. We ſée commonly that men iudge of the Prince &amp; his abilitie, according to the reputation of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. For if his Counſellers be wiſe, and in all points ſufficient men, then is he alwaies accounted wiſe. For it is no ſmall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of wiſedome in a Prince, to be able to knowe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne wiſe and ſufficient men from others, and to chooſe them that are faithfull &amp; loyall, to be his Counſellers, leauing thoſe that be vnſkilfull and rude. But when the Counſellers are not learned, prudent, and rare men, it is impoſſible that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince haue a good reputation. For he erreth in the principall point, if he chooſe inſufficient and bad men to be his Counſellers. And it is in a manner neceſſary, that he who erreth in a matter of moſt great importance, muſt alſo erre in all other things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. For if the Fountaine be infected, all the water muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be alſo infected: euen ſo, if the counſell be corrupted, all the gouernment of the Common-wealth goeth to wrack. If a Prince haue good Counſellers, though he doo amiſſe, yet will no man beléeue it: but if his Counſell be not good, though we
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2048:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſée the Prince doo well, yet can we not beléeue it, or we thinke that it was doone by chaunce. By this may we perceiue, that a Prince who hath truſtie and loyall Counſellers, doth thereby not onely obtaine good ſucceſſe in his enterpriſes, but alſo great credit and reputation, both among his owne Subiects, and alſo among ſtrangers. His own Subiects loue and obey him, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers feare him, and all men ioyntlie with one voice ſingularlie commend him.</p>
               <p>5 Euery Prince ought to thinke, that a learned Counſel is more neceſſarie for him, then the bread which he eateth: to the end he may heare the trueth. For Princes cannot abide to heare the ſimple and naked truth, by reaſon of the multitude of flatterers, which compaſſe &amp; enuiron them on euerie ſide. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it good that euery man ſhould be ſo bolde as to tell the Prince the trueth: for ſo they might incurre danger, to looſe their kingdoms and authoritie, and be had in no account.</p>
               <p>The royall Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> to ſhewe that all men honoured<note place="margin">Pſalme. 17.</note> and reuerenced him, ſaid, that they all lyed vnto him. For they that are of power and authoritie, no man dareth to tel them the trueth: but to poore men that are of ſmall power, euerie one ſpeaketh fréely and boldly.</p>
               <p>If a Prince haue many Prouinces vnder his gouernment, he ought (as we haue ſaid) to chooſe Counſellers out of euery one of the places that are vnder his ſubiection, and not out of one or two onely: for the people taketh it very impatiently, to ſée that they be, as it were excluded, and caſt off from the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gouernment of the Common-wealth, ſeeing not one of their Countrimen to be of the Counſell: and they think (and that with great reaſon) that the Prince maketh but ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them: or that he taketh them to be ſlaues &amp; bond-men, or that he thinketh them not woorthy to be truſted. The firſt ingendreth hatred. The ſeconde ſéeketh libertie, and therefore they conſpire againſt the Prince, and confederate with ſtrange Kings. The thirde emboldeneth them to admitte any kinde of treaſon againſt their natural Prince.</p>
               <p>When a Prince chooſeth a Counſeller, he ought not to be contented with thoſe onelie that dwell in his Pallace or Court, nor of thoſe that are his owne Countrimen, nor of thoſe which he knoweth by ſight or by heareſaie, although they be neuer ſo

Neither ought a Prince to make too much haſte in chooſing of his Counſellers, but to take leyſure and time enough, in conſidering and learning the ſufficiencie of all ſuch as ſhall be named vnto him.

The Church was not verie cléere, to ſhew that counſell ought to be kept very ſecret: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man ought to knowe what is handled or treated of in it.

magnificentlie and ſumptuouſlie builded. For he thought, that theſe exteriour and outwarde ſhewes of magnificence and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, were nothing neceſſarie vnto Counſellers for to vſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and iudgment: but that they did rather hurt &amp; endomage the moſt excellent gifts of the mind, making men either abiecte and effeminate, debaſing their courage, or els proude and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and mooued with ſuch vaine and ſuperfluous buildings. For continuall experience teacheth vs, that when men méet or aſſemble together in ſome gorgious place or ſtatelie Hall, moſt ſumptuouſlie and coſtlie built and ſet foorth: then they ſpende the time in looking vpon the comelie building, or in beholding the Images engrauen and carued in the walles, the cunning pictures artificiallie painted on the entries and doores, the ſtatelie Pillers erected vp a meruailous height, and of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thicknes, and in viewing the curious workmanſhip of the Roofe. And ſo, as well they that come into ſuch ſtately places to giue counſell, as they that come to take counſell, buſie theyr braines, and employ all their ſences in thoſe friuolous thinges, looſing that which is woorth a great deale, for that which is worth little or nothing.</p>
               <p>This which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ordained in <hi>Lacedamonia,</hi> (which<note place="margin">Plato in Alcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biade, 1.</note> Common-welth was not adorned and decked with many mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ornaments, and gorgeous furniture, though it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie welthie and puiſſant,) taketh no place in thoſe famous and<note place="margin">Xenophon de Cyri minoris expendi, lib, 6.</note> rich Common-welths, in which ſuch magnificence is vſed. For it beſéemeth ſuch Common-wealths, that the houſes in which the Senators and cheefe Gouernours enter, to conſult vpon matters concerning the eſtate of the Realme, be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the magnificence and greatnes of the ſame Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.</p>
               <p>They that cauſe Schooles to be builded for thoſe that learn, ought to follow <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his ſaying: erecting them in places that be not delightfull or pleaſant, ſo that there be nothing in them, to allure and withdrawe the eyes of the Schollers from their Bookes, which maketh them nothing attentiue to heare that which their Maiſters read vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> (as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> and S. <hi>Baſil</hi> affirmeth) did chooſe out<note place="margin">Maiſilius Fiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in vita Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonis.</note> a place in <hi>Athens</hi> to teach, which was neither delectable nor wholeſome: becauſe he béeing hard, &amp; of a ſtrong temperature,

the place ſhoulde not hinder his imaginations and thoughts, which neceſſarily ought to be frée, and not occupied in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, delights and paſtimes, which would haue hindered him from contemplation and ſtudie. The great Turke hath a window couered with a greene vaile, or Curtaine of ſilk, forth of which window, he ſéeth and heareth all that the Baſſaes ſaie and doo, when they aſſemble together in the houſe of Counſell. And thus béeing neither ſeene nor heard of the Baſſaes, he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth to all what they ſpeake, and heareth the mones of thoſe that complaine. And the Baſſaes and Turkiſh Counſellers, not knowing whether the Turke be harkning behind the window, or no, dare not but deale iuſtlie with thoſe that come thether for iuſtice, or ſpend the time in vaine talke, which tendeth not to the ſeruice of their Lord. Some Counſellers were woont to commaunde, that the doore of the Counſell-chamber ſhould be left open, becauſe no man ſhold ſtand behind the doore and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what they ſaid.</p>

And if I am not deceiued, it is ſufficient if they leaue but onely one thing, to wit, their owne priuate commoditie: for this is it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2048:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               <p>5 When the men of <hi>Galacia</hi> would conſult vpon matters of great waight and importance, they vſed a moſt abhominable cruell, and deuilliſh ſacrifice.

In a certaine part of the kingdome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> they vſe this. When they that dwell in that Countrey goe to aſke counſell of the Prieſtes, vpon that which they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to doo: the Prieſts hold in their hands the booke, which is commonly called the booke of Lots or Fortune, and according to that which they find written in that booke, they anſwer them that come to conſult with them. It ſéemeth that the Booke of Lots or Fortune, wherewith they deceiue the ignorant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaltie, was brought out of <hi>Perſia:</hi> wherefore the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did with great reaſon forbid the ſame Booke of Fortunes to be read, that they which are of little vnderſtanding, might not be deceiued by it.</p>
               <p>6 Séeing that counſels, and the ſucceſſe of thoſe thinges which are conſulted, proceede, (as we haue ſaide) from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt: it is conuenient, that all Counſellers before they beginne to conſult, ſhould humblie requeſt and beſéeche the holie Ghoſt, with great deuotion and humilitie, to direct them in their way, and leade them in their conſultations, ſaying that ſeruice which is properlie belonging vnto the holie Ghoſt.

For it is he, that by the means of the Angels, ſheweth vnto vs what we ought to doo. For this is an euerlaſting truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with perpetuall experience, that in the moſt harde and difficult things of all mans life, where the wit of man is moſt blind, and doth moſt want counſell and forces: there dooth the diuine wiſedome of the Lord, ſhew it ſelfe moſt cléerely &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfullie.

And ſo ſhe rebuked the faintnes of the Gouerners of <hi>Bethulia.</hi> For it is a token &amp; ſigne of great weakenes and ignorance in a man, to doo all matters according to his own wiſdome and humane counſels. It were better and ſafer, to deſire the Lord that he wold be our guide in all our actions and counſels: for he will direct vs in the readie path, &amp; ſhew vs which waie is beſt, ſéeing that he neuer fayleth to aide thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> powre forth their praiers vnto him.

               <p>7 And the better to bring this to paſſe which we ſaie, we ought to doo according to the commaundements of our Sauiour and Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who neither deceiueth himſelfe nor can not deceiue them vnto whom he giueth counſell. For from him floweth the ſpring of vnderſtanding and knowledge, and he is the author and cauſe of all goodnes.

               <p>The trueth ought to be told vnto Princes, with due honour and reuerence, as the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> did vnto King <hi>Dauid:</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he declared the Dreame of the<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> Trée vnto King <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> ſaying vnto him: My Lord, the Dreame be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof vnto thine enemies. <hi>Iohannes Franciſcus Lotinus</hi> (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2048:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doubt vpon any thing, and their opinions be diuers, they ought not to croſſe or gain-ſay them that are of a contrarie mind, leaſt they ſhold ſéeme more curious in defending theyr own opinion, then carefull for the common profit. It is therefore conuenient for Counſellers to accuſtome themſelues, patiently to heare all that which in the Conſell is ſaide or ſpoken: and not to ſpende the time in declaring and expounding their own opinions, and contrarying that which other Counſellers alledge. For manie men in conſultations, are more like to Maiſters, that read and diſpute in Schooles, then Counſellers that conſult what ought to be doone.</p>
               <p>6 If the counſell which is giuen, be manifeſtly knowne to be good, no man ought to care whether he that giueth it be vertuous or vicious: for that counſell which without doubt is prooued to be good, ought alwaies to be preferred. But this ought in all counſels to be conſidered, whether he that giueth the counſell, regard more his owne particular profit, then the commoditie of the Common-welth: for by how much the more counſels are frée from all reſpects of priuate commoditie, by ſo much the more are they profitable vnto the Common-wealth.</p>

And within this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine precept (as our Sauiour and Lord Jeſus Chriſt teacheth vs) be the Lawes and Prophets included. This rule &amp; doctrine which our Lord and Redéemer gaue vs, is ſo plaine and cléere, that it needeth not any gloſſe or expoſition at all.</p>
               <p>21 They that conſult vpon any matters, iudge better of that which others counſell, then they doo of that which they counſell themſelues. For euerie man is ledde by nature, to like well of his owne opinion and ſentence: becauſe his iudgment is not ſo free to iudge of his owne matters, as of a ſtrangers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. And for this cauſe, ought euerie one that writeth bookes and pamphlets, to ſhew them to their freends before they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to the preſſe: that they may fréely ſhew their minds, what they thinke ought to be chaunged, and what to be correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for no man can iudge aright of thoſe works which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe, becauſe the loue which he beareth to himſelfe, and all what he dooth, doth blind him, and ſuffereth him not to miſlike with any thing that is of his owne dooing. And therfore it is commonlie ſaid, that the firſt thing which a Child dooth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is borne, is that it maketh the father fonde: for it doth in ſuch manner blind his eyes and iudgment, that he thinketh his child to be a great deale fairer then all other children. As the Ape béeing aſked of the Fore, how he might knowe her young ones if he ſhould chaunce to méete them, that he might ſpare them, anſwered: that they were the faireſt that he could find. Who going into the fielde, found them, and did eate them, for they ſéemed not ſo faire vnto him, becauſe he looked not on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſame affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which their mother did beare vnto them.</p>

vpon a matter concerning the Common-wealth: he ought not to alledge many reaſons, which may bring them into ſome confuſion, and ſtay them from giuing their reſolutions. For when they be (as it were) dulled, with the confuſion and multitude of reaſons: they be hindred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> executing that, vnto which their naturall inclination doth pricke and entice them.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, ſaid, that the Counſellers of Princes, were ſpectacles to that Prince that lacked wit &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to iudge of ſuch reaſons as were alledged vnto him: he ſaid furthermore, that thoſe Princes which could not ſée without thoſe ſpectacles were not very wel: but they were worſe, that could not ſée neither without them nor with them. And the Counſellers of Princes, are not onely the ſpectacles through which they ſée, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> looking glaſſes in which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces behold what is doone in theyr abſence. Euery Prince ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ought to knowe and vnderſtande, whether they repreſent the right and true Image of that which they ſhewe: for there be certaine hollowe looking glaſſes, which ſhewe a thing quite contrarie, and otherwiſe then it is in deede: for ſome glaſſes make a little thing ſeeme bigge, and ſome make a great thing ſéeme little: and againe, ſome glaſſes make one thing to ſhewe as if there were a great many. All theſe differences and many more, which the perſpectiue Arte teacheth vs concerning loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glaſſes, are found in Counſellers of Princes, who informe not their Princes truelie of all that is doone. And therefore it is moſt neceſſarie for a Prince, to enquire and learne, whether his Counſellers of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he taketh counſaile vpon matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Common-wealth, be pure and cléere looking glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or whether they be falſe glaſſes repreſenting a thing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then it is, and whether they ſéeke colours, to make that which is blacke ſeeme white, and white to ſhewe as if it were blacke. For thus Painters doo, and thoſe Counſellers that imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them.</p>
               <p>23 There be ſome Counſellers, that are ſo proude and arrogant, and that take ſuch delight in their own ſayings, and in hearing themſelues ſpeake, that they knowe not howe they ſhall conclude, or with what periode they will ſhut vppe theyr ſpeech: often repeating that which they haue ſaid: not becauſe they might be the better vnderſtoode, but to féede their humour

with the pleaſure which they conceiue in their owne wordes, and as S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſaith, to be accounted men of ſingular elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.<note place="margin">Lib. 26, cap. 18 In Iob.</note> But <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> teacheth the contrarie, ſaying, make not many wordes, when thou art among the Elders, neither repeate a thing often.

                  <hi>Phocion</hi> one of the chéefe Gouernours of <hi>Athens,</hi> ſaid, that that was the beſt kind of ſpeech, which in few words contained much matter: for words are like money, which is accounted ſo much more precious, as in ſmal quantitie it containeth greater price and value. And ſome men are ſo enamoured with theyr owne words, that wen they thinke they haue ſpoken brauelie, they aſke, whether they haue not ſpoken out of the purpoſe, not becauſe they doubt whether they haue or no, but becauſe they would be praiſed. The beſt and ſureſt thing that one may doe<note place="margin">Sanct. Grego. lib. 10. cap. 1.

It is an eaſie matter (ſaith <hi>Titus Liuius</hi>) for one to find<note place="margin">Libro. 8.</note> out wordes and reaſons, after he knoweth what ought to be doone.</p>

               <p>34 Some Counſellers are ſo ambitious, that they will not conſent to any counſaile but their owne: and wil not ſuffer any other mans counſaile to be put in practice, though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo profitable for the Common-wealth, ſtaying and delaying the execution thereof by all meanes poſſible. And whereas they might atchiue both honour and glory, by bringing the ſame to paſſe which is concluded, they will not: onely becauſe it was not doone according to their own counſaile and liking. But ſuch
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2048:67"/>
men knowe not, that the true glorie of heroycall enterpriſes, dooth not onelie conſiſt in knowing what ought to be doone, but alſo in executing that which is determined.</p>
               <p>35 They that conſult vpon matters concerning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, ought not to forgoe any profit that may be gotten: no not ſo much as that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie which may be gotten by ſuch men, as haue greatly endomaged the Common-wealth. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brias</hi> a Cittizen of <hi>Meſſala,</hi> ſaide vnto one <hi>Euridanus,</hi> (a man cheefe &amp; principall in the gouernment of the Common-welth, but very ſullen and rigorous in nature. O <hi>Euridanus,</hi> thou art a neceſſary euill in the Common-wealth: for they that liue in it cannot chooſe but be conuerſant with thée, and yet becauſe of thy frowning and lowring countenaunce, they cannot abide to continue with thee.</p>
               <p>36 <hi>Plutarch</hi> counſelleth them that goe about to perſwade the people to any thing, that they ſhoulde not all of the at once, ſing one note, but that there ſhould be diuerſitie of iudgments at the firſt, but afterwards (as if they were ouercome by them that ſhewed better reaſons) they ſhould agrée all in one opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all iumpe, as it were, into one mind. For ſo the people, thinking that they were forced vnto that vnitie of conſent, will ſoone be perſwaded, that that which they ſay, is moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Common-wealth. But in ſmal matters, and ſuch as cannot greatlie endomage the Common-wealth, it were good that the Counſellers ſhould in earneſt differ in their cenſures, one from the other, euery one vſing his own reaſons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they might afterwards in greater matters of more waight and importance, ſeeme to agree, and be all of one mind. This pollicie did many Hereticks vſe, ſuborning ſome of theyr freends that ſhoulde gaineſaie that which they ſaide, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when they did diſpute with them, they ſhoulde confeſſe that they had erred in miſliking their doctrine, ſéeing they had with ſuch forcible arguments and neceſſary concluſions proued and confirmed it vnto them.</p>
               <p>37 There is much difference betwixt thoſe that in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes enquire what ought to be doone, and thoſe that contrarie and croſſe other men, to ſhew that they onely vnderſtande all themſelues, and that no man els is ſo fine headed as they be. For they that enquire of all circumſtances, concerning that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2048:67"/>
thing about which they conſult, conſider and ſift the matter throughlie without affection, and their iudgment is not incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with any thing that may hinder them from diuining and coniecturing ſuch accidents, as may happen in thoſe matters vppon which they deliberate: and theſe men are very good and neceſſarie in a Common-wealth; for they oftentimes ſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that gouerne it, ſome thinges, which before that time haue laine hidden and ſecrete from them. But contrarilie, they that contrarie thoſe that propoſe any thing in counſell, loue not the Common-wealth, but hinder and ouerthrowe all affayres both publique and priuate: for whilſt they alterate &amp; contende,<note place="margin">Nimis altercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do veritas amit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur, &amp; Plato, Dialogo, 1. de legibus.

The vttermoſt end and iſſue of the Law is, the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Common-wealth. When men deliberate vppon the ſafetie of the Common-wealth, they ought not to regarde honeſtie, but ſetting aſide all reſpects, they ought to folow that which is profitable.

But I take that opinion, to be of more waight and moment, which holdeth, that wee ought to make more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of honeſtie, then of vtilitie: but if that which is honeſt, depend vpon the Ciuill and poſitiue Lawes, and not vppon the naturall and diuine Lawes, let all the Ciuil lawes ceaſe, when as the neceſſitie of the Common-wealth is ſo great, that it can not be remedied vnleſſe they be broken. This holdes in thoſe Common-weales, which acknowledge no ſuperiour: and in thoſe alſo which do acknowledge one, if they onely violate thoſe Lawes which they may break, without the hurt or hinderance of their Superiour: for all the humane and poſitiue Lawes, which are inſtituted and ordained for the conſeruation of the Common-wealth, ceaſe, if they be hurtfull and domageable to the Common-welth. <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> termeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mortal Lawes, for warres change thoſe that were made for peace, and peace breaketh thoſe that were made for warre.</p>

with many words which be not very acceptable vnto him. And when he hath made an end, then ought not the other too haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie beginne, to gain-ſay or croſſe that which he hath ſaide: but ſtaie a while (as <hi>Eſchines</hi> ſaith) and ſée whether he will recall that which he hath ſaide, or correct it, or adde any thing more vnto it, or detract ſome thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it.

when they find in others, they ought to conſider whether they iarre not in that ſtring themſelues, before they finde it a faulte with others. For certes it is an eaſie matter to rebuke, but a very vaine thing, and ignominious vnto vs, if wee be faultie our ſelues, and take not heede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falling into the ſame errors: wherefore when we rebuke any one, we ought to thinke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vpon that ſaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> haue not I perhaps commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any ſuch thing? and euen as in the eyes of other men, wes ſée the repreſentation of our owne Image: ſo ought we to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine our owne words in the words of other men, to the end we ſhould not ouer-raſhlie diſpiſe others, and that we ſhould take more héede and diligence when we ſpeake our ſelues.

               <p>44 They that aſſemble together to conſult, ought not to be proude, and puffed vp with vaine glorie, nor leane vppon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, bending their bodies on neither ſide, nor hang theyr heads, but ſitte bolt vpright, hauing ther bodies erected in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie order, and giuing eare vnto him that ſpeaketh, in ſo much that hee may perceiue them which heare him to be attentiue: They ought moreouer to be conſtant, ſincere, pure, vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſimple, without diſſimulation, not puffed vppe with pride, hatred, or any other thing: in ſo much that they ought alwaies to be in a readines, and not to ſeeke what they ſhoulde ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe things whereof they conſult.

And note this; that all that which we haue ſaide of thoſe that heare, ought alſo to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by thoſe that ſpeake. Furthermore, as in Tennice play, hée that receiueth the ball, ought to mooue and bend his bodie, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninglie to bandie it backe againe to him that ſent it, ſo in reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and diſcourſing, as well he that ſpeaketh, as hee that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, muſt do his part &amp; duetie, and dilligentlie obſerue what he ought to doo. So that Counſellers ought, whether they heare or ſpeake, to behaue themſelues orderlie in all reſpects; and take heede when they begin to ſpeake or diſcourſe of any thing, that they be not too tedious; for many, when they once beginne to talke, they neuer make an end.</p>
               <p>45 The Counſellers of Princes are ſubiect vnto two great inconueniences, The firſt is, that if they counſaile not theyr Princes to doo that which they thinke to be moſt profitable for the Common-wealth, without hauing any reſpect vnto theyr owne profit, or any other thing; then they diſcharge not their dutie. The ſecond is, that if they doo counſaile their Princes, to doo that which they will not doo, then they incurre daunger of their liues. And to ſhunne theſe inconueniences, the beſt and ſafeſt way for them is, to beware of both extreames, and folow a mean in euery thing: ſhewing their minds vnto their Prince with great modeſtie, concerning euery matter, (as that which toucheth nothing their own perſons) in ſuch order, that if the Prince follow their aduice, he may doo it willingly of his own accorde, that it ſéeme not that he is drawne or forced to doo it, by the importunitie of him that giueth the counſaile. And if the Counſeller doo thus, there is no reaſon why the Prince ſhould beare him ill will, or be highly offended with him: and ſo the Counſeller may auoide that danger, which els he ſhould incur, if in any thing hee withſtoode the Prince his pleaſure: or the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2048:71"/>
ſelfe-liking and opinion of the other Counſellers. For if the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe be infortunate, euery one endeuoureth to diſpatch him which gaue the counſaile. So that in this caſe, when Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers counſaile their Princes modeſtlie (after the maner which we haue ſhewed) though they gette not that glorie which they obtaine when the counſaile falleth out proſperouſly: yet they haue two commodities, the one, that they be not ſubiect to anie daunger, the other, that though their counſaile haue no proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous euent, yet they gette no diſcredite by it, but be rather in more account. And contrarilie, they that will be chéefe &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall in the Counſell, and wil ſuffer no counſaile to be preferred before their owne, if their counſaile fall out vnhappilie, &amp; haue but had ſucceſſe, then they are rebuked, &amp; beare all the blame: and though it fall out well, yet the diſcredite and infamie which they procure when the matter dooth fall out infortunatelie, is greater then the credite or glory which they get whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al things ſucceede proſperouſlie.</p>
               <p>46 As they that are inuited to ſome banquet, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<note place="margin">Plutarch. de offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio auditoris.</note> with that whith is ſette on the Table before them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſking any thing els: euen ſo in counſels, they that heare another man ſpeake, ought to heare him with great attention: and not to mooue any doubts, or interrupt his ſpeech with vain queſtions: for all the profit that commeth thereof, is onelie to trouble him that ſpeaketh, and cauſe him to erre, and digreſſe from the purpoſe. And therefore they ought not to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto them that are in the Counſaile, aſking them often about one and the ſelfe ſame thing: for ſuch (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayth)<note place="margin">Vbi ſupra.</note> are like thoſe little byrdes, that cannot yet flie, and yet be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies gaping at other birds bils, to receiue theyr foode alreadie champed and chewed by them. To conclude, it is the point of fooliſh and ſimple fellowes, and ſuch as haue no witte, to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of queſtions at euery word, and to be ſtill enformed vpon euery point.</p>
               <p>47 They that conſult vpon matters of great importaunce, ought to conſider, (as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> ſaith) whether that<note place="margin">Lib, 18,</note> which they determine vpon, be profitable vnto their Princes, and whether it may be put in execution, without harming or endomaging the Common-wealth. They ought alſo to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; whether they that giue the counſaile, are like to come into
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2048:71"/>
into trouble if it fall not out proſperouſlie: and who ſhall gaine the credit and honour if all thinges ſuccéede happily. And aboue all, they ought to haue a regarde, what the people talke, if the Prince doo as they counſaile him; for though all other men vſe to follow thoſe counſailes, which are moſt profitable for them, though they be not altogether iuſt: yet Princes ought to doo nothing (as the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſaith) that paſſeth the boundes of iuſtice: greatly regarding their fame &amp; reputation: and what would be ſaide of them, if they ſhould followe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes that were hurtfull to the Common-wealth.</p>

The Counſell of eſtate ought alſo to take heede, that no prouiſions, voyages, and expeditions be made by ſtealth, to the domage of the Common-wealth, and commoditie of the enemie. It appertaineth alſo to the Counſell of eſtate, to ſée that all ordinarie expences &amp; charges, be diſcharged in due time, as well in peace as in warre, and to giue bils for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of the money out of the Counſell of ſubſtaunce and Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes: which Counſell ought to be as a Coſfer to keepe the money, which is to be diſtributed and deliuered out, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and authoritie of thoſe that are belonging to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of eſtate.

               <p>4 Séeing that in the Counſell of eſtate, it is cheefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted what ought to be doone, for the preſeruing and maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Common-wealth it is neceſſarie that the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of that Counſell, be well practiſed and experienced in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie diſcipline, and very ſkilfull and prudent in ruling Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths: ſo that they ought to knowe howe to enquire, examine, and iudge all things concerning pollicie and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in peace and warre. Further more, they that conſult vpon peace, whither it he profitable, it ſhould be eſtabliſhed or no: ought to know what is belonging to war, ſeeing peace and warre he two contraries: and the nature of contraries is ſuch, that the one is knowne by the other. In auncient times paſt, many Senators entred into the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> to conſult, and they that had triumphed for victorie ouer their enemies, ſate with the Crownes on their heads (which they wore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they triumphed) as tokens and ſhewes of their vertue and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. And this did <hi>Cyneas</hi> the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> declare, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he béeing aſked of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> what he thought of the Senate<note place="margin">Plutarchus in vita Pyrrhj.</note> of <hi>Rome,</hi> he anſwered, that it ſéemed vnto him to be a counſell of many Kings, that were aſſembled together to conſult. <hi>Liuie</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Cyneas</hi> in this aunſwere, ſhewed the greatnes and excellencie of the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> for in it were not onelie manie noble and famous Captaines, with thoſe Crownes on their heads, with which they triumphed, becauſe they had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantlie ouercome their enemies, and ſubdued manie Princes to the Empire of <hi>Rome:</hi> but alſo many ancient perſons of great authoritie &amp; eſtimation, wonderfullie exerciſed in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>5 Thoſe ordinaunces and Lawes, that were made at the<note place="margin">Macchiauellus in diſcurſibus.</note> firſt beginning of the Common-wealthy, when men were good, afterwards whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>anen became wicked, ſerued to no purpoſe: for the Lawes varie according to the accidents that happen in the Citties, but the ordinaunces are verie ſeldom altered. And thys is the cauſe that good Lawes ſuffiſe not, becauſe the ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces remaining ſtable and inuiolable, doo diſanull them. There was in <hi>Rome,</hi> the ordinance of gouernment, or rather of eſtate;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2048:73"/>
and after wards the Lawes and Offices with which they brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Cittizens. The ordinaunce of the oſtate, was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the people of the Senate of the Tribunes (for ſo the Protectors of the Commons were called in <hi>Rome</hi>) and of the Conſuls: and it was the manner and order howe the Lawes ſhould be ordained. Which ordinaunce is not change or al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eb by reaſon of any accidents that may chaunce, but ſhe Lawes which keepe the Cittizens in obedience, they be altered: as the Lawes which were made for the conſtraint of adulterie, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue expences, and ambition, and many other Lawes aceor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the people dailie grewe to be more &amp; more wiched and vicious. But becauſe the ordinaunces of the eſtate, which the people béeing corrupted) were not good, did remaine inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: thoſe Lawes which were renued, did not ſuffice to keepe the people from wickednes: but they might haue doone-much good, if the ordinaunces had béene renued with the Lawes.</p>
               <p>6 We may eaſilie perceiue, that it is not good, to haue the ordinaunces remaine ſtable and inuiolable, when as the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ware wicked, by two principall things: the one touching the election of Officers, and ordeining of Magiſtrates: the other touching the eſtabliſhing of Lawes. There was an ordinaunce in <hi>Rome,</hi> that none might be Conſuls, or beare any other great Office in the Cittie, ſauing thoſe Cittizens that did ſtande for the Office, and made ſute for it. This ordinaunce at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was verie good, for then no Cittizens ſued or ſought to beare Office, but ſuch as thought that they did deſerue to be in authoritie, and they tooke it for a great diſeredit to haue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, and therefore euerie one, becauſe they woulde be iudged and accounted worthy of that dignitie, endeuoured to be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But after ward, this ordinaunce became very harmfull and pernicious: for they that were moſt mightie, not moſt vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſued for the dignitie, &amp; they that were not mightie, though vertuous, for fear durſt not ſtand for the Offices. To this inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience came it, though not in a moment, yet in continuance and tract of time, as all other inconueniences vſe to happen. For the <hi>Romans</hi> hauing ſubdued all <hi>Affrick</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and brought almoſt all <hi>Greece</hi> vnder their ſubiection, aſſured themſelues of libertie, and thought not that they had any enemies whom they needed to feare. Whith ſecuritie of theirs, and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2048:73"/>
of their enemies, cauſed the people of <hi>Rome</hi> in the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Conſuls, not to reſpect vertue, but fauour: ſo that thoſe were placed in that dignitie, that wiſt better howe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine their fréendes, then to encounter with their enemies. And after that, they which were moſt gracious had a prettie while borne the Offices, then they which were mightieſt, and coulde preuaile moſt, were elected to be heade Officers, ſo that honeſt and vertuous men, by the defect of ſuch an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, were altogether excluded from the dignities, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beminences which chéefely appertained vnto them.</p>
               <p>7 Therefore to the ende that a Common-wealth may be maintained in her wonted libertie, it is neceſſarie that newe ordinaunces be made, to remedie that which the mallice of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bath corrupted: for little profit the Lawes, when the whole ſubiect and bodie (as it were) of the Common-weale is ſo much diſordered, that they cannot poſſiblie ſette it in order againe. Some ſay it is well nigh impoſſible, that all ordinances ſhould be changed: for if they would diſanull them by little and little, it is neceſſarie that it ſhoulde be doone by ſome wiſe man that foreſeeth and perceiueth, what inconueniences might happen by reaſon of ſuch like ordinaunces, and thoſe men that are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to liue after one manner and order will not alter that ordinaunce, eſpecially, becauſe they perceiue not the diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie thereof, vnleſſe it be ſhewed vnto them by apparent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures. Moreouer, if they woulde goe about to repaire the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunces all in a moment, yet albeit euerie one eſteemed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be naught that yet would it be very hardlie brought to paſſe. For to vſe ordinarie meanes, (ſéeing they be naught) is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: but it is neceſſaire, that he ſhould come at laſt to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie meanes, to witte, violence and Armes: and before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing, to make himſelfe cheefe of that Cittie, that hee may chaunge all thinges at his will and pleaſure: and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his Lawes and ordinaunces, it is neceſſarie he ſhold haue authoritie to ſuppreſſe them, that through enuie propoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to gaineſaie &amp; contrarie them: for no man can hope that tract of time may confirme them, and his vertue and honeſtie that bringeth them in, ſufficeth not: and as for the fauoure of the people, that is variable: and wickednes and miſchiefe will not be appeaſed by any gifts or good turns, according to that.

               <p>8 All this diſcourſe (which is taken out of <hi>Machiauell</hi>) is grounded vpon this, that in thoſe Common-weales that be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and gouerned by many, they that rule and gouerne them, doo verie hardlie agrée one with another, in keeping and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the old and auncient cuſtonies: and it ſeemeth that thys holdes in thoſe Common-weales, that are weake and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the counſaile of manie: who, though the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be moſt manifeſt and notorious: yet through their naturall imbecillitie, they knowe not, nor cannot tell howe to repayre them: But thoſe Common-weales that can renewe the olde rites and cuſtomes, can as well annihilate and diſanull thoſe<note place="margin">Galen in lib. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis medicae, ca. 89</note> that be both bad and hurtfull, and as Phiſitions when they be acquainted with the cauſes of the diſeaſes, they take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way firſt, and afterward very eaſily cure their Patients, ſo it is conuenient, that they which gonerne Common-weales, ſhold as a neceſſary remedie, execute puniſhment on offenders, when men liue ſo corruptlie and wickedlie, that thoſe ordinaunces which at the firſt were good &amp; holie, cannot be innouated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bloodſhed and fire: which are the remedies with which God dooth cure the vices of men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

alter the Lawes and ordinances, by which the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weales were ruled when they began, and ſquare them to the times in which the Common-weales increaſe, and become greater and larger. For a great Common-wealth cannot be conuenientlie maintained; with the ſelfe ſame Lawes and ordinaunces, with which it was maintained and gouerned, when it was but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, though notwithſtanding that it be ſaide, that Princes goe about to ſpoile and marre the eſtate, when they begin to break the old lawes and rites, and auncient cuſtomes, vnder which men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> liued many yeeres: for this holds not, when neceſſitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that the gouernment ſhould be changed, and ſquared to the preſent eſtate of the Common-wealth.

And euen as the dilligent and careful Labourer, taketh great pains in weeding his Gardens, and rooting out thoſe hearbes which are rather hurtfull then wholeſome vnto his groundes: ſo they that rule and gouerne Common-weales, ought to labour, clenſing them from all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious weedes of wickednes and naughtines, which hurt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for there is nothing more hurtfull, and leſſe profitable to the Common-wealth, then to ſuffer diſſolutnes of manners, and pernitious cuſtoms to encreaſe and augment dailie; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, moleſt and vexe the Common-wealth.

And for this cauſe, no Prince ought to make warre, vnleſſe hee cannot otherwiſe chooſe: and vnleſſe hee cannot enioy peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the harme of the Common-wealth, the loſſe of his eſtate, and impayring of his reputation. Otherwiſe, if a Prince can obtaine an honeſt peace of his enemie, vpon reaſonable and iuſt conditions, he ought not to wage war, but conclude that peace, to ſhunne bloodie battels, ſlaughters, ſpoyles, pillings, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and all ſuch other wicked actions, which are practiſed in time of warre. And if thoſe Princes that conſult, whether they ſhall wage warre or no, conſidered all the domages and harms that may ſuccéede by waging warre, they would neuer be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to make warre: whereby they ſhoulde increaſe theyr ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies forces, and weaken their owne. Therefore incontinently after that they that are of the counſel of eſtate, haue concluded, that it is expedient for the profit of the Common-wealth, and ſafetie of the Prince, that warre ſhoulde be made againſt the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2048:82"/>
enemie. Euery one ought to determine fullie, either to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, or to die in the enterpriſe: as a Woman of <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> ſaide to her Sonne, when ſhe gaue him a Target to goe to warres: returne my ſon either with this Target, or els with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it.</p>
               <p>2 Euery Prince that goeth about to make war, ought firſt to conſider whether he be able, and if he be: then whether the profit that is like to enſue, be greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the harme which may ſuccéede: for if the loſſe ſhould be greater then the commoditie, that would be (as <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> ſaide) as if one ſhould fiſhe<note place="margin">Suetonius Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillus in vita Auguſt.

He ought furthermore, dilligentlie &amp; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to enquire, what forces his enemy hath, and whether his own power and ſtrength be ſufficient to vanquiſh the Armie of his enemie, and ouerthrow it. And if he ſtand in doubt, and can not certainly be informed, whether his enemies forces or hys owne be the greater: hee ought to thinke, that his aduerſaries are better prouided, and more ſtronglie garded: that he may be the more dilligent, and the more carefull in perſecuting his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and infirming their forces and powers: for many Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, becauſe they reſpected not their enemies, and made no account of them, were ouercome and put to flight. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, to examine, both his enemies forces, and his owne: he ought to knowe whether of them bothe, hath the greater ſtore of money, hée or his enemie: and howe long the warres are like to continue, and howe much money is neceſſarie to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them.</p>
               <p>In this, great care and dilligence muſt be taken: for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney<note place="margin">Claudius Coto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus de iure mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litum in prohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio, libro, 2.</note> (as it is commonlie ſaide) is the ſinnewe of warre: which beginneth and endeth it: and for this cauſe, the Counſellers of Princes ought to enquire, whence prouiſion of money may be had: and howe they may bring to paſſe, that their enemies ſhoulde want. And howe needefull and neceſſarie this is, wee may manifeſtlie perceiue by this, that many enterpriſes haue beene giuen ouer for lacke of money to ſupply the charges of warre, as happened to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> King of <hi>Lacedaemonia,</hi> with <hi>Antigonus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 Princes ought to conſider what Captaines they chooſe for the warres: for if the Captaine, who is the guide to leade and conduct the Souldiours, be not valiant and prudent, then
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2048:82"/>
muſt all needes goe to wracke. <hi>Tullie</hi> in his Oration, <hi>pro le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge Manilia,</hi> ſetteth downe the perfect patterne of a good and<note place="margin">In oratione pro lege Manilia.</note> valiant Captaine, ſhewing what quallities a good Captayne ought to be endued withall, to become famous; of which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I haue written verie largelie, in my Booke of the Office of Captaines and Generals.</p>
               <p>That the warre may in all points haue proſperous and good ſucceſſe, all men knowe howe important and neceſſarie it is, that the Captaines ſhould be hardie, valiant, couragious, and faithfull: for nothing can be more hurtfull in warres, then fearefull, cowardlie, faithles, and vnſkilfull Captaines. There ought alſo great care to be had in the preſſing of Souldiours, what men be choſen to ſerue their Prince in warre. For the Souldiours be they that muſt fight, and gette the victorie: and therefore, though the Captaines, Generals, and all other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, be neuer ſo perfectlie adorned, and endued with all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall vertues: if the Souldiours be baſe and cowardlike fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, the warres cannot be fortunatelie finiſhed.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> went to fight with <hi>Perreyus</hi> in <hi>Spayne,</hi> he ſaide that he went to ſeeke an Armie without a Generall: and when hee went to meete with <hi>Pompey,</hi> he ſaid: that hee<note place="margin">Suetonius Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillus, in vita Iulij Caeſaris. cap. 34.</note> ſought a Generall without an Armie. And therfore in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering and training vppe of Souldiers, great dilligence ought to be taken in examining and enquiring, whether thoſe Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours that be preſſed for the Prince his ſeruice, be faithful, or Traytours to their Countrey and Prince, whether they be conſtant, or inconſtant and variable: whether they be newe and freſh-water Souldiours, or olde and experienced Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, that haue long time beene practiſed and trained vppe in warres: whether they come of their own accord with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind to ſerue their Prince, or be forced thereunto by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion: and whether they come for the loue they beare theyr Countrey, and obedience they owne vnto the Prince, or bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baſe and raſcall fellowes, fetcht out of Innes, Tiplinghou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and other ſuch like places, they come to ſerue the Prince onelie for paye: beſides theſe, there are manie other thinges which ought to be carefullie conſidered in the preſſing of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours: as I haue written more at large in my Bookes of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie diſcipline.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:2048:83"/>Furthermore, Princes that determine to ſette vpon theyr enemies, ought to enquire, what Harnes thoſe Souldiers haue, that are gathered for ſeruice in warres. For Souldiers that be well weaponed, fight with a more valiant mind, then they that are vnweaponed and lacke their harneſſe. And when ſouldiers are throughly well fenced with Armour of proofe, they be the more emboldened to ſet vpon their enemies, to aſſault Fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; to vndertake any kind of ſeruice. And many times ſome kind of weapons, are not ſo good and ſo apt to obtaine the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as others: as may be ſéene by the difference of weapons, which the <hi>Lacedaemonians, Romans,</hi> and <hi>Parthians</hi> vſed. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> often vanquiſhed their enemies: not becauſe they were more valiant, &amp; more ſtrong or couragious then their enemies. but by reaſon of the oddes in fighting with better weapons. Therefore Princes ought alſo to enquire what weapons theyr enemies vſe in warre, and with what weapons they ought to Arme their owne Souldiers, to defend themſelues, and endo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage their enemies. And alſo, what places are moſt fitte and conuenient to aſſault their enemies, and ſureſt for theyr owne ſafetie.</p>
               <p>4 They that mean to wage war with any Country, ought to knowe what freendes they haue to helpe and aſſiſt them, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie, if they haue no Countries, Townes, or Prouinces, in that Land which they meane to inuade. And it is very good in ſuch enterpriſes, to haue ſome one naturall borne man in that Countrey to their freende, to be holpen by him, and informed of the humors, intereſt, pretences, conditions and cuſtomes of the enemies: and whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places which they inhabite, be plaine, or hillie, and full of Mountaines: and of what thinges the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that Countrey ſtand in neede of, and what things would be moſt acceptable vnto them, to entice them to come to ayde and helpe them: and ſo they ſhall diminiſh their enemies forces, and augment and increaſe their own. It were very good alſo to learne, whether the people of that Countrey which they meane to aſſault, make much of their King, or els hate him, for it chaunceth oftentimes, that the people rebell againſt theyr King, and take part with the enemies, becauſe they hate their King, and would willinglie be reuenged of him, or becauſe they loue the other, and deſire greatlie to haue him to be their King.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2048:83"/>
Certaine Cities in <hi>Aſia</hi> did rebell, by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hatred which they bore againſt <hi>Laodice</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and becauſe of the affection with which they loued <hi>Bernice</hi> and his Sonne.

               <p>5 Many Princes haue atchiued many famous and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent victories, through the eſtimation, credit, and reputation of their own perſons. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, publiſhed that he was<note place="margin">Titus Liuius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cad. 3. lib, 6.</note> Sonne vnto <hi>Iupiter,</hi> (though he knew it was not ſo) that thoſe Nations vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made warre, ſhould yeeld and giue ouer their Countries vnto him.

               <p>Seeing that the euents of warres are ſo vncertain and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, wiſe and valiant Captaines, ought to encreaſe the fame which is bruted abroade of their good lucke and proſperitie, in theyr Martiall endeuours, that they may encourage their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to fight, and they that are not fortunate, ought to ſhewe vnto their Souldiers, how inconſtant and variable Fortune is, and to perſwade them that thence-forwarde, all matters wyll<note place="margin">2, Reg. 11.</note> ſuccéede more happilie, for the aduenture of war is vncertaine.</p>
               <p>6 The firſt thing that all Princes which make war ought to doo, is to iuſtifie that warre which they take in hand, that all men may knowe, that they are bounde to fight, by the neceſſitie
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2048:84"/>
which compelleth them to defende themſelues: and although their cauſe be good, and grownded vppon reaſon and iuſtice, yet they ought to accept any honeſt and lawfull condition of peace, which their enemies doo offer them. Againe, Princes ought to conſider, that warres are commonly made, either to recouer that which hath béene taken from them, or to reuenge ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie that hath beene offered vnto them, or becauſe they deſire to atchiue glorie and renowne, or for ambition: the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde cauſes are iuſt, the thirde is vniuſt, and the fourth is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were alwaies verie carefull, in iuſtifying the warres which they made, with all dilligence poſſible. which may be ſeene by this, that the Embaſſadour of the Ile of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> when he went about to praiſe the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaide in a certaine Oration which he made to the Senate, that the <hi>Romans</hi> did not ſo much eſteeme the conqueſt, as the equitie of their cauſe: and becauſe in my booke of Militarie diſcipline, I haue largely writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how Princes ought to iuſtifie their wars, I meane not heere to ſtand vpon it.</p>
               <p>7 They that conſult vpon Martiall affaires, ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, when they be ouercome with their enemies, whether the faulte was in the Captaines, or in the common Souldiers, or becauſe it pleaſed God, that though euery man did his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet they ſhoulde be put to the worſe: and after the cauſe is knowne, they ought to thinke vpon the remedie, and to doe all things that are expedient to atchiue victorie of their enemies. And if they vnderſtande y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their enemies are ſtronger, and that they muſt continue their warres, it is better for them, to defer the field (as <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> did) then to enter battell to the manifeſt daunger of their whole Armie. For, with delaying the time, they may ouercome, and with giuing a raſh onſette, they ſhall be put to flight, and as we of olde ſay in <hi>Caſtile: Diez au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos de guerra, y no vn dia de pelea,</hi> that is;

               <p>Princes ought alſo to conſider the neceſitie which they haue to make warre, and to vnderſtande what prouiſion they ought to make, againſt occaſion be offered them to make warre, that if any ſtrangers goe about to moleſt them, they may defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by force of Armes, and not be vanquiſhed: for there is no Prince ſo great, mightie and ſtrong, but ſome or other may ſet vpon him. And as our olde <hi>Caſtilian</hi> prouerbe goeth, <hi>Muchas vezes chicas piedras aballam grandes carreras.</hi>

               <p>That it is the duetie of euerie Prince, to defend his ſubiects from the enemie, and gouerne them in peace &amp; quietneſſe, may be ſeene in this, that when he taketh his oath at his Corrona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee holdeth his Scepter, with which he is to rule his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in time of peace, in his right hand, and his ſworde is borne before him, with which he is to defend his Countrey, if neede be he ſhould make warre for the conſeruation of peace. Séeing therefore that the cheefe Office of a Prince is, to maintain his Subiects in peace, I meane to treate in this diſcourſe of ſuch things as be belonging to the Counſell of peace.</p>
               <p>1 Counſellers of Princes that conſult vpon the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of peace, ought humbly to requeſt God, that it wil pleaſe him, that the peace may be concluded to his honour and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And when they doo agrée vppon any peace, they ought to conſider what cauſes hindered, that the peace which before was eſtablished, did not firmely remaine vnbroken: and they ſhall cléerely ſée, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make peace, either becauſe they be waſted &amp; deſtroied with wars, or becauſe one Prince is ſubdued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, &amp; cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or becauſe they deſire to be fréends, and to ouercome one another in curteſie: &amp; this laſt cauſe is the beſt to eſtabliſh a firme and continuall peace, if it be doone with true amitie &amp; perfect loue.

if they would graunt it vpon good and honeſt conditions, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it ſhoulde be but very ſhort. They that will eſtabliſhe a firme &amp; ſtable peace, that may continue for euer, ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that God be not angrie or diſpleaſed, but fauourable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice and mercifull vnto them: that, he béeing the right author of al peace and true concord, may proſper the peace which they make. And they may eaſilie pleaſe and reconcile God, with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and earneſt prayers, if they humbly with all theyr hart beſeech his holines to giue them iudgment and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to execute iuſtice: for the worke of iuſtice ſhall be peace: euen the worke of iuſtice ſhall be quietnes and aſſurance for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,<note place="margin">Eſay, 32, 17.</note> as <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet ſaith.</p>
               <p>2 If they that conſult vppon the making and eſtabliſhing of peace, cannot conclude, they ought to make a truce for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time, that they may haue ſome ſpace to deliberate vppon it, and to examine the conditions vpon which the peace is to be concluded, and to ſée and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, whether it be better for them to proſecute the warre, or to giue it ouer, and many times a truce béeing made for a time, the peace is eſtabliſhed, whereas there had none béene concluded, if no league had beene made for ſome daies.

               <p>3 Séeing that the augmentation of the Common-wealth, dependeth vpon peace, and the ende for which men take Armes in a Common-wealth well inſtituted, is to conſerue the good eſtate thereof in peace, it is conuenient, that the Counſellers of Princes ſhoulde perſwade their Prince, that it is better to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept an honeſt peace, then to make a daungerous warre. The
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2048:87"/>
                  <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> made ſo great account of peace, and deſired ſo earneſtly, that no occaſion might be offered them to make warre, that they continually ſaide in their banquets, would to God our weapons were hanged ouer with copwebs. In that peace which the <hi>Romans</hi> concluded with King <hi>Porſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> they allowed it with this condition, that they ſhould not vſe anie yron ſauing in tilling of the grounde. And becauſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the eſtate of the whole Common-wealth, dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the conditions vpon which the peace is eſtabliſhed, and men cannot in any other thing erre ſo greatlie to the hurt &amp; domage of the Common-wealth, it is conuenient that they which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude<note place="margin">Valerius Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus. lib. 7. tit. 3.</note> the peace, ſhould be both wiſe and warie. <hi>Titus Labeo,</hi> béeing vrged to make a peace with King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> at the ſame Kings demaund, ſaid that hee was contented vppon condition, that halfe of King <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſhyps ſhould be for the behalfe of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> which béeing graunted by the King, <hi>Titus Labeo</hi> commaunded halfe the part of euery ſhippe to be cutte away: becauſe all the ſhyps ſhould remaine for the <hi>Romans.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Conſuls of <hi>Rome</hi> agreed to make peace with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagineans,</hi> ſo they would yeelde and render all the ſhips which they had; ouer vnto them: which as ſoone as the <hi>Carthagineans</hi> had doone: the <hi>Romans</hi> commaunded all the ſhyps to be ſette on<note place="margin">Lucius Florus de geſtis Roma. lib, 2, cap. 5.

               <p>4 Though all Common-weales labor to maintain peace, and auoide occaſions of warre: yet the ambition and mallice of men is ſo great, that no man ought to truſt to the peace that is eſtabliſhed betwixt him and his enemies. For vnder the colour of peace, they oftentimes practice many ſubtill deuices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they obtaine that, which vnleſſe ſome peace had béene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, they coulde neuer haue attained vnto. Thoſe Princes that are not moleſted with warres, but rule their Subiects in peace, ought not to ſuffer their people ſo to giue themſelues to

And vnto thoſe people which are iuſt and vertuous, God giueth good Kings, and ſuch as doo the Common-wealth much good, and are as Angels ſent from heauen, to conſerue and defend her. Therfore thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that doo not this, accompliſh not their dutie, and cannot be properlie called Princes, but equiuocally as a painted man is called a man. The holie Scriptures call thoſe Princes that doo<note place="margin">Iob. 34.</note> not miniſter iuſtice, vnto euery man according to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, hypocrites: for they haue no princely thing in them, but onely the name of Princes, and béeing moſt cruell Wolues, they be maſked and diſguiſed with tokens onelie, and ſhewes of moſt mercifull Princes.</p>
               <p>2 God doth oftentimes permit, that Princes ſhould ſuffer many troubles and aduerſities, to turne them from their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked liues, and to ſhewe them that God dooth puniſh &amp; chaſtice Princes, Kings, Monarches, and Emperours, when they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne not their people as they ought, according to the will and pleaſure of the higheſt Monarch of the world. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> that God did ſhew vnto <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babilon;</hi> how that God is Lord of all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, &amp; giueth them vnto whom he will: and euen as School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters correct their Schollers, to make them to applie theyr bookes, and duelie come to ſchoole: ſo GOD dooth chaſtice the Princes of the earth, that they may performe their duetie, and vnderſtand that the true beginning to gouerne well, as well in time of peace as war, conſiſteth in knowing that God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic is the Lord of all kingdomes, and that the beginning of all<note place="margin">Prouer. 1.</note> knowledge and wiſedome (as King <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) is the feare of the Lord: and this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt leſſon which they ought to learn that will follow him, and the firſt ſhewe and token which they make in the ſchoole of his doctrine. The feare of the Lorde is glorie and gladnes, and reioycing, and a ioyfall crowne. And the feare of the Lord maketh a merrie hart, and giueth gladnes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2048:89"/>
and ioy, and long life, and who ſo feareth the Lord, it ſhall goe well with him at the laſt, and hee ſhall finde fauour in the day of his death. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> beeing taught by the holie<note place="margin">Pſalm. 2.</note> Ghoſt, ſaith. Be wiſe now therefore ye Kinges: be learned ye Judges of the earth, ſerue the Lord in feare, &amp; reioyce in trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. Kiſſe the Sonne leaſt he be angry, and ye perriſh in the way, when his wrath ſhall ſuddainlie burne, bleſſed are al they that put their truſt in him. And thoſe that follow not this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, God viſiteth with calamities and aduerſities, which hee ſendeth vnto them to cauſe them to turne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wickednes, and to obey his commandements. That which we ſay of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, is alſo to be vnderſtoode of thoſe iuſt and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princes, whom God doth croſſe with miſ-fortunes &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that they may be ſuffering them patientlie, deſerue that glorie which God giueth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſerue him. To be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with miſerie, plague, famine, fire and warre, is common both to good and wicked men: but onely good &amp; vertuous men die in the ſeruice of our Lorde and Sauiour Jeſus Chriſt, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his croſſe on their ſhoulders: for (as the kingly Prophet<note place="margin">Pſalm, 115.</note> ſaith) precious in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</p>
               <p>3 God alſo deſtroieth Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weales by appointing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to rule ouer them as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, and I will appoint children to be their Princes, and babes ſhal rule ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them.<note place="margin">Cap. 3.</note> For ſorrowfull (as King <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) is that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Eccleſi. 10.</note> in which the Prince that ruleth it is a Childe, and they that giue him counſaile and gouerne him, are giuen to theyr luſtes and pleaſures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo the Prophet <hi>Hoſeas</hi> ſaith, that when God is angrie, and will puniſh the people for their ſinnes<note place="margin">Cap, 2.</note> which they commit, he appointeth children to be their Princes.

                  <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe of the Lawes <hi>Agraria,</hi> which cauſed great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations at euerie time that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> did intend to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh it in that Cittie: this Lawe <hi>Agraria</hi> had two eſpeciall clauſes; the one ordained, that no Cittizen might poſſeſſe more then a certaine number of Akers of lande: the other, that all what ſoeuer was gotten from the enemies, ſhould be equallie deuided among the people of <hi>Rome:</hi> and this Lawe was verie hurtfull to the Noble men, for it depriued them of their goods, and hindered them from increaſing their welth and riches. But the Noble men oppoſing themſelues, ſought one remedie or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put down this Law: and either they brought an Armie of man out of the Cittie, or they cauſed that when one Tribune did propoſe the Lawe, another ſhoulde contrarie him: or they graunted part of the Lawe: or they ſent people to inhabit that place which ſhould haue beene diſtributed among the people of <hi>Rome:</hi> to be ſhort, howe hurtfull it is to fauour and maintaine ſciſmes and partialities in a Common-wealth, may be ſeene, in that many Common weales haue béene therby deſtroied and ouerthrowne: and therefore <hi>Plato</hi> calleth diſſentions and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">In dialogo, 1, &amp; 5. de legibus.</note> poyſon, that ſpoyleth and deſtroyeth Common-weales. To make an end, thoſe Common-weales that are gouerned by the people, perriſh and decay, if one man continue long in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and this was the cauſe of the deſtruction of <hi>Rome,</hi> as may be noted in <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> who tyranniſed, though notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Cato Vticenſis</hi> (wiſelie diuining and coniecturing the euent of the matter) contraried the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that they did appoint <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> to continue in the generallſhip, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then his day before prefixed: ſaying, that they gaue the Armes and weapons vnto him, that with them ſhould deſtroy them, Unto which, <hi>Pompey</hi> (who at that time fauoured <hi>Iulius</hi> Caeſar) anſwered, that <hi>Cato</hi> by ſaying ſo, did nothingels, but

giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion to ſuſpect, that he owed <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> a grudg: and that which he ſaid himſelfe, did procéed of freendſhippe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the people of <hi>Rome</hi> hauing appointed the Trybunes or Protectors of the Commons, to continue in their Office the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeere, becauſe they thought that they were very ſufficient to withſtand the ambition of the Noble men: and to maintain the libertie and benefite of the Common people, againſt theyr power: the Senate, becauſe they would not ſerme to haue leſſe power and authoritie then the people, would haue had <hi>Lucius Quintius</hi> (who at that time was to giue ouer his Conſulſhip to ſome other) to continue in his Office, and be Conſull an other yeeere: but <hi>Lucius Quintius</hi> contraried the Senate in that, ſaying, that naughtie examples ought to be ſhunned, &amp; not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied and increaſed with another farre worſe example: and<note place="margin">Lybanus in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumento ad O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynthiacam pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henis.</note> would haue them to chooſe newe Conſuls. Laſtly, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales perriſh and decay, if they that beare rule ouer them, be young men, little experienced in gouernment: and the people that liue in them is verie riche, for it is naturall vnto them to be careleſſe, negligent, and vicious if they be welthie: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe neceſſitie vrge them to labor, they will neuer take paines.

as an other, and in all points equall, ſo that none of them haue any aduantage of the other: and when any of them conquer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place, they make the reſt partakers of the conqueſt, as the <hi>Suicers</hi> do in <hi>Heluecia,</hi> and as the <hi>Aguei</hi> and <hi>Ethoti</hi> did in <hi>Greece.</hi> The ſeconde manner to augment Common-weales, is, alſo by way of alliance: but in ſuch ſorte, that they haue the chéefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, rule, and gouernment, and the tytle of all the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes: this maner is the beſt, and was vſed of the <hi>Romans:</hi> for they kéeping the emperial ſeate, and tytle of commaund to them ſelues, theyr alliants depriued of all power and authoritie, of themſelues by their owne ſweat and blood, became ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſeeing they were compaſſed about, and oppreſſed on the ſuddaine by ſuch a mightie Cittie as <hi>Rome</hi> was: and of alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and companions, became ſubiects and bond-men, not bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to defende themſelues, by reaſon that they had increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, augmented, and aduaunced the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire with their owne forces. The third and laſt manner, for Common-weales to be augmented and enlarged, is, to make them whom they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, not fellowes, but ſubiects, as the <hi>Spartans</hi> did: but of all thrée, this is leaſt profitable, if they be not able to keepe and gouerne thoſe Citties which they conquer. For it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſayd, that he that conquereth an Empire and forces withal, becommeth mightie: but hee that atchiueth an Empire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forces, muſt néedes decay. The <hi>Romans</hi> to augment theyr Common-wealth, did imitate them that prune Trees, who to make a Tree grow and bring forth fruite in time, doo cut off the firſt boughes, that the vertue of that plant may remaine in the ſtemme, and by reaſon thereof, greener and more fruitfull boughes may ſpring out of it. And that this manner to enlarge an Empire or dominion is good and neceſſaire, may be prooued by the example of <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> which beeing two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales very ſtrong, mightie, well Armed, and eſtabliſhed with moſt excellent and perfect Lawes, could neuer reache or attaine to that greatnes, vnto which the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> was aduaunced. And yet did <hi>Rome</hi> ſéeme to be more ful of diſordered and ſeditſous troubles and contentions: yea and nothing ſetled in ſuch good order and faſhion, as thoſe two other Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales, <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Athens:</hi> whereof no other reaſon can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, then that which is alreadie giuen: for <hi>Rome,</hi> (becauſe it
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2048:92"/>
had augmented the body of the Citty by thoſe two waies which we haue ſhewed) could gather together eyght &amp; twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men for their defence, and <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> neuer coulde goe beyond the number of twentie thouſand each of them. And this came not becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was ſcituated in a better place then <hi>Sparta</hi> or <hi>Athens,</hi> but by reaſon that a different kinde of procéeding was vſed, in the erecting and eſtabliſhing of thoſe Common-weales: for <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the firſt founder of the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> Common-wealth, thinking that nothing coulde ſo eaſilie innouate or abrogate his Lawes, as the mixture and confuſion of newe Inhabitants, he bethought himſelfe all meanes poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, howe he might bring to paſſe, that no Straungers ſhoulde come to dwell in <hi>Sparta,</hi> or be conuerſant in it: and therefore he ordained, that in his Common-weale, no money ſhould be vſed but of Copper, becauſe no man ſhould haue any mind to come and dwel in that Cittie, or to bring any Merchandize or wares thether from fortaine Countries. And for this cauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the Cittizens could neuer be increaſed. And becauſe al our actions imitate nature, and it is impoſſible that a little thin ſtocke ſhould ſupport or holde vp a great thicke branche, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſmall and weake Common-welth, cannot ouercome and vanquiſh great and mightie Citties and kingdomes, that are more puiſſaunt and ſtronger then it is: and if it doe conquer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, then it fareth with it, as it doth with thin and ſmal ſiemms, that haue groſſe boughes &amp; braunches, ſo that the ſmalleſt wind that is, doth blowe them downe and ouerturne them, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Sparta,</hi> which hauing taken all the Citties of <hi>Grecce</hi> by force, <hi>Thebes</hi> no ſooner rebelled, but all the other Citties did riſe with them againſt her: and ſo the ſtocke remained without braunches, which thing could not befall on <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe the ſtocke was ſo groſſe, that it was able to beare vppe and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the waight of any braunche.</p>
               <p>5 Common-weales be alſo augmented, by fauouring the Inhabitans: for when they that dwell in them, may liue fréelie out of bondage, and be Maiſters and Lordes of their owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, and ſuch goods as they get by their labor and trauaile, they multiply and increaſe their riches, as well in huſbandrie and tillage, as in Artes, handicrafts, trades, and Merchandize, for euery one doth with a good will, increaſe and heape vppe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2048:92"/>
thoſe goods which hee hopeth that hee may enioy after he hath got them. And by this it commeth to paſſe, that men ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſtriue and contend one with an other who may beſt regarde, both his owne commoditie &amp; the publique profit alſo.

For iuſtice &amp; Religion, are the two principal pillers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſupport al weales publicke, without which, no Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth can dure long, or continue: and with which, little Common-weales be enlarged &amp; made bigger, and great ones continue in their bignes, as I writte more at large in my bookes <hi>De Politijs et rebus publicis.</hi> Laſtly, Common-weales be increaſed and amplified, by not ſuffering any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that prouide them of maintenaunce and Merchandize, to engroſſe thinges, that no man may ſell or gaine but they: for theſe men cauſe the Common-wealth neuer to be without famine and dearth. <hi>Dioniſius</hi> King of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> baniſhed a certaine Merchant,<note place="margin">Ariſto.

                  <hi>Sicilie,</hi> that he might ſel it onelie, and haue al the gaines to him ſelfe. Finallie, Common-weales he augmented and amplified, by the carefulnes of Princes, if they prouide all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for their Subiects: euen as Sheepheards procure paſturing<note place="margin">Xenophon lib. 8 Cyropaediae.</note> and folds for their ſhéepe, ſhearing them (as the Emperor <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> ſaid) and not fleaing them.

Neither is he a good King, who dooth not procure that his ſubiects and vaſſals liue in peace, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich and wealthy: and this is the amplification and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, which the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> ſaith, that Princes ought to procure in thoſe Common-weales which they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne.</p>

               <p>2 The moſt difficult reformation of all, is to reſtore a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſsius</hi> went about to reſtore the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto fréedome: and though they were fauoured by manie, both of the nobleſt and cheefeſt of the Cittie, yet they could not bring it to paſſe, for the Cittie was quite alreadie marred and ſpilt, by reaſon of the diſſentions and warres of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> were now as it were accuſtomed to liue in bondage. Beſides this, they that labour or endeuour to ſet any Common-wealth at libertie, find partiall enemies, but no partiall freendes; for all they become to be their partiall enemies, that were the better by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince his eſtate, and reaped great profite by him and his ſubſtaunce. For they will be loth to haue the Prince depriued of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, leaſt they ſhould fare the worſe by it: or if by happe the Prince be depoſed of his gouernment, they ſéeing the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to be decaied, by reaſon whereof they are depriued of the commodity which they were wont to haue, cannot liue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedlie, but continuallie ſeeke meanes to attaine to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and fauoure which they enioyed before. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſide, they that endeuour to ſette any Common-wealth at libertie, finde no partiall freendes: becauſe to liue at libertie, ſeemeth to be nothing els, then to aſpire to honor &amp; rewardes,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2048:94"/>
by meanes of ſome honeſt and lawfull cauſes, for otherwiſe no man is either honoured and rewarded. And when any perſon receiueth thoſe preheminences, profits, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, which he thinketh that he deſerueth, then he confeſſeth not that hée is bound to him that honoureth and rewardeth him. Moreouer, the common profit which is gotten by liuing in a frée Common wealth, is not knowne by any one, as long as he dooth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it: which is, to enioy the vſe and commoditie of hys owne ſubſtance, and to diſpoſe of it at his pleaſure. And they that will goe about to remedie &amp; redreſſe theſe inconueniences, and dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, ought to doo as <hi>Brutus</hi> did, killing all thoſe that oppoſe themſelues againſt that newe gouernment which they wyll bring in to the Common-wealth. Which, <hi>Brutus</hi> well might doo, for when he expelled the Kinges, the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were not ſo vicious, nor ſo full of diſſolute manners, nor ſo wickedlie giuen, as when <hi>Brutus</hi> &amp; <hi>Caſsius</hi> ſlew <hi>Iulius Caeſar.</hi> And when<note place="margin">Lib. 1.

               <p>6 <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth, that Common-weales are altered out of<note place="margin">Dialogo. 8. de Repub.</note> one kind of gouernment into another, becauſe they that gouern them, regard their owne particular profit, more then the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique commoditie of the Common-wealth. For becauſe of their own priuate commoditie, they marrie Noble men with ſome of the Comminaltie, and will haue that ſome children in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, ſhould not follow the eſtimation and nobilitie of their fathers. <hi>Plato</hi> prooueth this, ſaying, that Nature whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe bringeth forth men, ſhe communicateth the properties of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals vnto them: and giueth the propertie of Golde vnto thoſe which are apt to gouerne Nations: and to thoſe that are vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and hardie, ſhe communicateth the propertie of ſiluer, that they may defend the Common-wealth: becauſe ſhee giueth the nobleſt place in the Common-wealth vnto them that gouerne it. And for this cauſe, euen as Gold is the moſt excellent of all Mettals, ſo the Arte of gouerning a Common-wealth, is the moſt excellent and worthieſt Arte of all. And as ſiluer is eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">Ariſto. lib. 1. cap. 2. Ethico.</note> moſt worthie of all Mettals next vnto gold: ſo they which

But I doo not beléeue that they which followe warre, will conſent vnto that which <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith. But ſéeing that Armes little profit or auaile without the counſaile of thoſe which gouerne the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, &amp; though Armes be neceſſarilie required for the defence of the ſame: yet notwithſtanding, the ſcience or arte of gouerning &amp; ruling Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; Countries, is very neceſſarie in a well inſtituted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, as I writt more at large in my Bookes of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie diſcipline.

But if the people be oppreſſed, and ouercharged with too many tributs, or cannot maintaine themſelues with that which they gette: then they finde that which they cannot of themſelues doo, for want of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to execute it, in thoſe which are able to diſquiet the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and chaunge the gouernment, and ſo with the helpe of the welthy and ambitious people, ſéeing that they haue more forces then their enemies, they hope that they ſhall eaſily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, and be deliuered from thoſe troubles wherewith they be oppreſſed.

It is likelie that it woulde be very profitable for euerie Common-wealth, not to allow ſongs and ballads or Muſick to be ſung in the Cittie, which may intice men to diſhoneſtie, and it were very good that, that diligence which Magiſtrates take in ſuffering no bookes to be printed, or pictures to be drawne, that may endomage or hurte the ſtate of the Realme, were alſo had, in examining thoſe kinds of Muſick and ditties, which are vſed in the Common-wealth: for Muſicke béeing a diuine gift, which eaſilie mooueth mortall harts, if men were accuſtomed to ſing holie Pſalmes and honeſt Sonets, it woulde no doubt, draw men from folowing of vanity and wickednes, to embrace vertue and honeſtie. In auncient times paſt, the Prieſtes and Prophets, to applie themſelues the better to diuine thinges, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Muſick, as King <hi>Dauid</hi> did, and the Prophet <hi>Elizeus,</hi> and among the Gentiles, Prophets and Philoſophers were Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. How forcible Muſicke is to mooue the harts of men, may be ſéene in children, who when they crie, are appeaſed and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted with Muſick: and in men alſo vpon whom God beſtowed (as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaith) the benefit of Muſick, with it the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to forget their labors, and by it to be perſwaded to doo that which is ſung vnto them. And for this cauſe diuers kindes of Muſicke applied to that which is ſung, is vſed in feaſts, playes, banquets, wars, ſolemnities and funerals. The Poets fayned that <hi>Amphion</hi> and <hi>Orpheus,</hi> two great Muſitions of <hi>Thracia,</hi>

               <p>12 The gouernment of a Common-wealth is alſo chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by factions, diuiſions of people in ſundry opinions, ſciſmes, and partialities: and euen as terreſtriall bodies grow and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: and when there is no outward thing that corrupteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they conſume of themſelues by reaſon of ſome inward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: euen ſo Common-weales, when they haue no forraine enemies, they Arme and prepare enemies among themſelues at home, to deſtroy one another. The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, ſaid, that as the ruſt doth eate vp the yron, and the wormes the fruite of the earth, ſo diuiſions doo diſquiet and deſtroy the whole Common-wealth, and alter the gouernment. And thys manner of alteration of gouernments, is the moſt daungerous of all: for as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, it is a moſt greeuous ſicknes, which deſtroieth and maketh many fameus Citties deſolate, which with their owne weapons wage warre againſt themſelues.

               <p>14 There is no reaſon, why <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhould reprehend his Maiſter <hi>Plato,</hi> becauſe in writing howe gouernments are changed, he ſette not downe the eſpeciall and particular cauſe, for the beſt gouernment of all, is changed into another, and the reaſon which <hi>Plato</hi> vſeth, (to wit, that all created thinges doe alter in time) doth not proue the eſpeciall &amp; proper cauſe of the alteration of the beſt gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into an other.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2048:101"/>
fall ſicke for common cauſes: ſo Common-weales (which are mixed bodies) are tranſ-formed and changed by common cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The reuolutions of the heauens, ſuffer nothing to continue ſtill without corruption that are vnder the Orde of the Moone, but all are ſubiect to alteration and corruption: eſpeciallie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe that rule and gouerne Common-weales are frée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, though notwithſtanding ſome ſaie, that ſéeing that thoſe which gouerne the Common-wealth, are not neceſſary but frée Agents, the naturall Agents ought not to be reſpected: for this doth not hinder that ſome gouernments are more eaſily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed &amp; changed into others, becauſe they be more readie and more diſpoſed to be tranſ-formed into ſome, then into others, whether the cauſes for which they be tranſ-formed and chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged be vniuerſall or particular. And that <hi>Plato</hi> in his Bookes <hi>De Repub</hi> did not ſet downe the particuler cauſes why Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales were changed: it was, becauſe hee imagining and ſayning a certaine Common-wealth (the <hi>Idea</hi> whereof is that, which he writte in his bookes <hi>De Repub.</hi>) he needed not to ſette downe the particuler cauſes why Common-weales doe alter, ſeeing that the vniuerſall cauſe ſuffiſeth. So that as in healthfull and ſound bodies, the generall cauſes ſuffice to alter their health and ſoundnes: ſo in a perfect Common-welth, the reuolutions of the heauens doo ſuffiſe to alter and change them: and <hi>Plato,</hi> ſeeing he intreated not particularlie of one eſpeciall kind of gouernment, but generally of the <hi>Idaea</hi> or example of all Common-weales: he needed not to ſette downe the eſpeciall and particular cauſes, why the gouernments change and alter: for ſeeing, as we haue ſaid, that thoſe which change them are free Agents, it ſuffiſed to ſette downe the generall and common cauſes for to ſhew how they are chaunged, becauſe the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar &amp; ſpeciall cauſes of the alteration of gouernments, though they procéede from frée Agents, yet they be reduced vnto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and vniuerſall cauſes. By this is concluded, that though the Kingdome and Tyrannie be contraries, and (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) differ greatlie, yet neuertheleſſe, a kingdome is ſooner<note place="margin">Lib. 8.

               <p>16 The regiments are tranſ-formed and chaunged, ſome into others according to the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> the Monarchie and Kingdome, into the <hi>Ariſtocracie,</hi> (which hee calleth the ambitious gouernment, becauſe they that gouerne, deſire and couet honours:) the <hi>Ariſtocracie,</hi> is tranſlated into the <hi>Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi> which is when a few gouerne, whoſe principall intent is, to be rich: this eſtate is not ſo good as the ambitious gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for honor and glory is preferred before riches: and the <hi>Oligarchie</hi> is changed into the <hi>Democracie.
